<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Work was part of my
late father's Theological Prelections, as Pro∣fessor
of Divinity. I know not whether he
ever intended to publish it; but had he lived
to prepare it for the press, it would have ap∣peared
in a much more perfect form than
that in which it is now offered to the Public.
I found part of it carefully revised and cor∣rected,
and transcribed on a different and
more extensive plan than what is followed
in his original notes on the subject. This
plan I have endeavoured to complete, though
conscious of its being executed in a very in∣ferior
manner to what himself would have
done. It is difficult to enter into another's
ideas, so as to make them entirely one's
own, or to pursue his hints so as to preserve
uniformity and consistency. Whatever de∣fects,
therefore, there may be in this respect,
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
or whatever inaccuracies in point of style,
must be charged solely on the Editor. Such
as it is, it is hoped the Work will be useful.
This was the only view of its Author, who
composed it for the benefit of those Candi∣dates
for the Ministry who were under his
care; a long succession of whom issued from
his school, and can, doubtless, bear testimony
to the pleasure and instruction they derived
from this part of his Theological Course:
and although it is peculiarly adapted to the
situation of Clergymen of the Church of
Scotland, yet it may not be unprofitable to
those also of other persuasions, who will find
it throughout breathing a spirit of rational
and elevated piety, and marked with that
candour and moderation which distinguished
his character.</P>

<HEAD>THE
PASTORAL CARE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN every pursuit, it is of great importance, first
of all, to fix a proper end: for the nature of the
end determines the means which are suitable, and
the course which we must take, in order to attain
it; and, if we fix a wrong end, it cannot fail to
mislead us into an improper track. The end of
every part of education, and every kind of study,
ought to be, to fit men either for the general du∣ties
of life incumbent upon all, or for some of
those particular employments which, for the com∣mon
convenience, are distributed to different men.
Whatever contributes to neither of these purposes,
is unprofitable or perverted: nothing can be of
real value, but so far as it promotes one or the
other of them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9"/>
Every employment requires some education or
preparation for it: and this must always be adapted
to the nature of that employment. It must always
include two things:—instructions concerning the
principles and functions of the art;—and exercises
fit for begetting a habit of acting according to
these principles, and executing these functions. In
a mechanical art, for example, a person must first
learn the nature of the several materials and in∣struments
belonging to it, and the manner of
using them; and next he must be accustomed to
use them, till he gradually acquire dexterity.
Both these are necessary: without knowlege,
practice would be undirected, lame, and blunder∣ing;
and without exercise, the greatest knowlege
could not prevent our being awkward, and at a
loss in attempting to perform.</P>
<P>Different employments require different methods
of education. Instructions and exercises necessary
in an apprenticeship for one art, would be useless,
or even absurd, in an apprenticeship for another.
The peculiar education proper for any art, can be
ascertained only by attention to the nature of that
art. Its nature ought to be constantly kept in
view, that the proper studies and exercises may
be selected, and conducted in such a manner as
to become most effectually subservient to it. This
is in some degree requisite even in the mechanical
employments: but it is more indispensably necessary
in those professions which hold of the sciences.
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
In the former, a great deal may be learned merely
by habit, and performed mechanically, by those
who are almost▪ totally ignorant of the principles
from which the practice is derived. The philoso∣pher
explains these principles—the ingenious artist
reduces them to practice; but the ordinary me∣chanic
acquires the practice without understanding
the principles on which he works. The mecha∣nical
powers, with their several combinations, are
every day employed by persons who know nothing
of the theory of them. Yet even in these arts,
knowlege of the principles gives a great advan∣tage
for practice: it distinguishes the inventor, the
improver, the workman of ingenuity and taste,
from the mere artificer. But in scientifical pro∣fessions,
no part of the practice is wholly mecha∣nical;
no step can be taken but in consequence of
knowlege of the principles: and the practice will
always be more or less proper in proportion to the
accuracy of that knowlege. A physician, for in∣stance,
cannot practise his art without understand∣ing
medicine; wherever his knowlege fails, his
practice must be deficient; and without a previous
idea of what the business of a physician is, he could
not with any degree of success prepare himself
for it.</P>
<P>The pastoral office is of this kind. It cannot be
properly exercised by a person who knows not the
several duties belonging to it, who is not acquaint∣ed
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
with the principles and sentiments requisite in
discharging them, and who has not learned the
proper manner of teaching and treating mankind,
so as to accomplish the end of his office. The na∣ture
of the pastoral office is therefore a subject very
necessary to be examined in the course of your
theological studies. The right discharge of its
functions is the very end to which all your private
studies, all the instructions delivered from this
place, and all the exercises prescribed to you,
ought to be subordinate. So far only as they
qualify you for that, they are useful, or at least
peculiar to you as students of theology. A just
conception of the pastoral office will enable you to
perceive, what studies are necessary to prepare you
for it, and to distinguish in what degree they are
necessary, that your attention to them may be in
proportion to their utility. It will enable you to
discern, how every part of study is applicable to
the execution of that office, and to learn the proper
use of the several parts of science, while you are
acquiring the knowlege of their principles. In
whatever period of your theological studies you
happen now to be, the pastoral office may very
profitably engage your attention. If you are but
beginning them, it will fix a proper aim at your
first setting out. If you are nearly finishing them,
it is high time to think seriously of the office which
you may be soon called to undertake. At every
step, a just idea of it will afford a light by which
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
you may review your past, and direct your future
studies.</P>
<P>Every person who considers the present state of
things, must be sensible that there is great need to
insist on the real nature of the pastoral office. In
all ages the best men have complained, that the
generality entered on it too forwardly, and with∣out
sufficient preparation. At present, many seem
to think scarcely any preparation necessary. They
bestow very few years upon it: and they must be
conscious, how small a part even of these they em∣ploy
for the very purpose of qualifying themselves
for it. While a long apprenticeship is required for
every ordinary trade, while intense study and ap∣plication
are acknowleged to be necessary for every
other learned or liberal profession, little study or
application is imagined to be needful for the busi∣ness
of a clergyman. This cannot fail to render
many unfit for performing it with satisfaction to
themselves, or with honour in the eyes of the
world: and it plainly tends to bring the office into
discredit, and to make men think that any person
is sufficiently qualified for being entrusted with it.
An effectual check to this evil, by public authority,
would be highly desirable: but, I fear, it can
scarcely be expected. It is for this reason the more
necessary to endeavour to impress you with a sense
of the genuine nature of the pastoral office, for
which you are candidates. This will assist you in
your preparation for it: and this will leave it on
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
every one's own conscience to determine, how far
he is really fit to enter on it.</P>
<P>This subject may be reduced to three general
heads;—the importance of the pastoral office,—the
duties belonging to it,—and the requisites for per∣forming
them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Importance of the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>THE importance of the pastoral office may
be considered as arising from two circum∣stances:
—its dignity, and its difficulty; which it
will be proper to examine separately.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Dignity of the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>IN examining the dignity of the pastoral office,
we shall point out—the real nature of its dig∣nity;
and the sentiments suitable to it, which it
requires, both in those who hold that office, and
in others.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The true Nature of the Dignity of the Pastoral
Office.</HEAD>
<P>IT is on many accounts necessary and proper to
ascertain the true nature and grounds of that dig∣nity
which belongs to the pastoral office. By some,
its dignity has been, not described and delineated,
but displayed in all the pomp of eloquence, and
exaggerated by an accumulation of the boldest
figures<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gregor. Nazianz. Apologet. Chrysostom. de Sacerdot.</NOTE>. A florid imagination prompted them
to represent it in this manner: the taste and bias
of the times bore it, or even invited it. The prin∣ciples
of the present age would give no indulgence
to declamation of that kind. It is indeed improper
in itself. Magnificent figures, if they be not strictly
just, convey no precise ideas: they may amaze,
but they infuse no permanent sentiments: they
may produce an unmeaning emotion for a moment,
but they form no determinate and durable temper.
To raise the dignity of the pastoral office above the
naked truth, by vague images and indefinite am∣plifications,
is not useless only; I am afraid, it is
hurtful also. Did it really obtain credit, it would
lead every modest, serious, conscientious person to
consider that office as too sublime for any mortal
man, and too pure for any imperfect creature to
venture on; as not desirable, but tremendous,
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
and by all means to be avoided. They who have
delighted in giving such representations of it, have
likewise thought themselves obliged to affect de∣clining
it, to flee into desarts, and to seem to be
dragged thence by violence to the acceptance of it.
They shewed, however, that their fancy had a greater
share in these representations than their judgment,
and that they did not fully give credit to them:
for without attempting to confute them, they af∣terwards
suffered themselves to be invested with
that very office. None who sincerely regarded it
in that point of view, could think of undertaking
it, except they were so worthless as to have no
conscience, no sense of obligation, no concern to
fulfil their duty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stilling fleet, Ecclesiastical Cases, Part I. charge ii▪ p. 116,
&amp;c.</NOTE>. They who ventured to occupy
it, would be elated with pride and arrogance:
others would either pay them excessive and per∣verted
veneration, or ridicule the extravagance of
their claims. What has real dignity and import∣ance,
stands not in need of exaggeration: and it
must suffer by it. A simple exposition of its in∣trinsic
moment, is sufficient for procuring it that
kind and degree of honour which it merits, and
will most effectually procure it.</P>
<P>It has been common to represent the pastoral
office as holy, as placing those who hold it in a
peculiar relation to God. There is a foundation
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
both in scripture and in reason, for the represent∣ation,
provided it be properly understood. Under
the Old Testament, not only Aaron and his sons,
but the priests also, and the Levites, were declared
to be “holy unto their God,” and to be “sancti∣fied,”
and “consecrated to stand before the Lord,
and to minister to him.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Exod. xxviii. 1. 3, 4. 36. 41. Lev. xxi. 6, 7, 8. Num. iii.
12, 13. 41.</NOTE>” Solemn rites, very
circumstantially desined, were expressly appointed
by God himself, for their separation to their offices.
The gospel not being, like the law, a dispensation
of ceremonies, God has not, with equal precision,
fixed rites for the separation of persons to the
Christian ministry: nor do the writers of the New
Testament apply to this office all the same terms
which are used concerning the ancient priesthood;
and which had, perhaps, a reference to the man∣ner
of separation for it. But Christian ministers
are spoken of in terms which plainly imply, that
their office places them in a peculiar relation to God.
It is, I doubt not, partly with a respect to their
inspiration and their immediate commission from
Christ, that the Apostles are called “ambassadors
for” him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 20.</NOTE>: but uninspired teachers are called by
a name nearly equivalent, “angels<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. ii. 1.</NOTE>,” or messen∣gers.
The inspired apostles were in a peculiar
sense, “stewards of the mysteries of God<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1.</NOTE>,” which
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
were revealed to them: but every Christian pastor
is likewise a “steward of God<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Tit. 1. 7.</NOTE>,” in a place of
trust and authority in his family, appointed to
dispense instruction to others. The teachers of
the gospel are all, in a sense in which other
Christians are not, the servants and ministers of
God; peculiarly appropriated to him, and set
apart for presenting the devotions of others to him,
and publishing his will to them.</P>
<P>It cannot, however, be denied, that the idea of
the sanctity of the pastoral office has been often
misunderstood and abused. Confused and im∣proper
notions of it have been propagated, and
perverted to the basest purposes of superstition.
That idea has been so much overstretched and
distorted, as to be made to imply an exemption
from the authority and jurisdiction of magistrates,
from subjection to all human laws, and from the
common obligations of men in society; a power
of giving, in a greater or a less extent, according
to the different degrees of the clerical character,
a virtue and efficacy, a kind of magical charm,
to the ordinances of religion; a privilege of ob∣taining
a higher measure of the favour of God,
than other men, or of obtaining it on different and
easier terms; a sort of interest with God, to en∣gage
him in all their views, to render every cause
of theirs his cause, to make it impious to oppose
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
them, or to punish their crimes, and to draw down
his judgments on all whom they reckon their ene∣mies.
Such unholy claims cannot possibly be
founded on the holiness of the ministry: they are
the offspring of ignorance and arrogance; they
are by turns the nurses and the nurselings of su∣perstition.
The Christian ministry is truly an holy
office: but it is so, only in this sense, that it is
occupied about holy things, that its object is re∣ligion.
They who exercise this office, are holy
only in this sense, that they “minister about holy
things,” and that they are strictly obliged to real
holiness, to moral goodness, without which their
character must be repugnant to the subject of
their profession. The consideration, therefore, of
the nature of the pastoral office, will lead us to the
very same view of its dignity, to which we should
be led by a just conception of its sanctity: and it
will render the exhibition of it more distinct and
precise, and less liable to misconstruction or abuse,
as well as more agreeable to the stile of the New
Testament. Following this track, we shall ascer∣tain
the real dignity of the pastoral office, by the
consideration of its acknowleged end, and of its
natural functions.</P>
<P>In every case, the dignity of an occupation de∣pends,
in a great degree, upon its end. From
this source, the Christian ministry, of all occupa∣tions,
derives the greatest dignity. The gospel of
Christ, which it is the business of that office to
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
preach, “is the power of God unto salvation<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rom. i. 16.</NOTE>.”
All the kinds of teachers in the Christian church,
are given for this purpose, “for the perfecting of
the saints, for the edifying of the body of
Christ<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 12.</NOTE>, that, warning every man, and teaching
every man, in all wisdom, they may present
every man perfect in Christ Jesus<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 28.</NOTE>.” The
consequence of the right discharge of this office
will be, that they shall “both save themselves,
and them that hear them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1. Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>.” It is its direct
aim, to carry forward, in a certain degree, that
dispensation of grace, which has, through all ages,
been the grand and favourite object of God's pro∣vidence
in this lower world; in promoting which
all the hosts of angels are employed; in the ex∣ecution
of which the Son of God was incarnate
and crucified, and the Holy Spirit given; and
which terminates in conferring eternal life on as
many as comply with it. While thus employed,
ministers are not only “fellow-servants” of the
angels<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii. 9.</NOTE>, but also “workers together with God,
beseeching men, as though God did beseech
men by them, praying them in Christ's stead,
that they be reconciled to God, and that they
receive not the grace of God in vain<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 20. vi. 1.</NOTE>.” The
pastoral office is concerned, not about the fortunes
of men, not about their lives, but about what is
infinitely nobler, about their souls: it is concerned
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
about the interests, not of time, but of eternity.
In a far sublimer sense than that in which the an∣cient
painter gloried, the Christian minister works
for immortality. If the lawyer succeed not in his
cause, his client may be reduced to poverty; if
the skill of the physician prove ineffectual, his
patient will die: but, in whatever case the end of
the pastoral office is defeated, everlasting destruction
is the consequence. Such being the end of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that
office, to suppose any insensible of its importance,
would be to suppose them besotted by the vanities
of time, and blind to the interests of eternity.
And does this end reflect no dignity on the office
which is adapted to it? Can it but be an honour∣able
employment, to promote so great a design?</P>
<P>The pastoral office derives dignity and import∣ance
from the nature of its functions, as well as
from the sublimity of its end. For our perceiving
this, it will not be necessary to enter into a minute
detail of these functions; they will be explained
afterwards. At present it will be sufficient to ob∣serve
in general, that they consist in “teaching<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 11. vi. 2. 2 Tim. ii. 2. Eph. iv. 11. Rom. xii. 7.</NOTE>”
pure religion, “instructing<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 15.</NOTE>” men in the nature
of it, “convincing<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Acts, xviii. 23. Tit. i. 9.</NOTE>” men of its principles and
obligations, “exhorting<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 2. Tit. i. 9. ii. 15.</NOTE>” men to the belief and
practice of it, “reproving and rebuking<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>” every
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
sin, “warning<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 31. Col. i. 28. 1 Thess. v. 14.</NOTE>” men of the temptations to which
they are exposed, and of the danger of yielding to
them; in “watching<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 5. Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>” for men, and “over∣seeing<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 28. Phil. i. 1. 1 Tim. iii. 1, 2. Tit. i. 7.</NOTE>” them for these purposes, taking every
proper opportunity, in public and in private, of
promoting them; in “being ensamples to the
flock<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE>, in all things shewing themselves pat∣terns
of good works<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 7.</NOTE>;” in endeavouring with∣out
intermission to qualify themselves more and
more for all this, and then exerting themselves
indefatigably in it; in a word, in using every
means that can be used by one man for infusing
knowlege and goodness into other men. That
these functions confer dignity on the office to
which they belong, will be evident, whether we
consider them in themselves in relation to their
end, or in respect of their necessity and usefulness
to the people.</P>
<P>Some exercises are in their nature low and
mean; to be engaged in them, sinks a person in
the eyes of others. The gospel engages its mi∣nisters
in no exercises of this kind. It lays them
under peculiar obligations to practise and improve
in all piety and virtue; if they fulfil the obliga∣tions,
they acquire that righteousness which ren∣ders
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
a man “more excellent than his neighbour<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Prov. xii. 26.</NOTE>”
It engages them in the search of truth, and in
communicating knowlege: and if it be any part of
the dignity of man, that he is a reasonable crea∣ture,
it must be honourable to be employed in
searching after truth, and diffusing it among men.
To discover truth in that extent which belongs to
the pastoral office, requires, besides a considerable
compass of previous knowlege, the exertion both
of the acuteness of the philosopher, and of the
judgment of the critic. In communicating it suc∣cessfully
to others, the talents of the orator must
be, in some degree, employed. Each of these
characters has always been acknowleged respect∣able:
to deny, therefore, that the pastoral office,
which requires the union of them all, is respect∣able,
would be to judge of this one case, in con∣tradiction
to the natural sentiments of all mankind
in every other case. To promote any kind of
useful knowlege, has some merit; the name of a
teacher gives a person some elevation, in that one
respect at least, in comparison of those who are
taught by him: and the elevation bears always a
proportion to the subject which a person is qualified
to teach, and engaged in teaching. It is the very
office of ministers of the gospel, to teach others:
and the subject of their teaching is the sublimest,
the most important, the most interesting: it is
honourable to be occupied in teaching it; it is
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
very honourable to be fit to teach it. It is the
very business of ministers, to inculcate the noblest
truths, those which regard God and divine things;
to recommend universal goodness, the glory of
human nature; to form the souls of men to that
divine temper which will fit them for the everlast∣ing
society of God; to “feed” and “oversee”
with care, that church on which the Lord set so
high a value, as to “purchase it with his own
blood<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 28.</NOTE>.” The office of a teacher implies au∣thority,
the kind and degree of authority which
suits its nature. The teachers of Christianity have
authority in the church; they “are over you,”
says the apostle, they “have the rule over you in
the Lord<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 12. Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>.” Their authority is of the kind
which is congruous to their work: they neither
are “Lords over God's heritage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE>,” nor “have
dominion over men's faith<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 24.</NOTE>.” They often
have claimed temporal power, political authority,
and civil dignities: but the claim is usurpation;
these are the pre-eminences of the kingdoms of
this world, but their office is solely in the kingdom
of Christ, which “is not of this world<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">John, xviii. 36.</NOTE>:” these
have a relation to the secular affairs of men, but
this office only to their spiritual concerns. Even
in their spiritual concerns, the authority of mi∣nisters
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
is very far from being absolute or unlimited.
It includes no power over the consciences of men;
no right to impose upon them, any principles of
belief, or rules of conduct, but those which the
scripture has imposed; no right to obtrude upon
them our explications of scripture or deductions
from it. The claim or exercise of such rights, is
not the government of Christ, but the tyranny of
Antichrist: both to the people and to ministers,
the scripture is the only standard of religion: mi∣nisters
have authority to teach only what it
teaches; and by it, and by it alone, it is the
right of the people, and their duty also, to exa∣mine
what is taught. Even those doctrines and
those precepts which are clearly contained in scrip∣ture,
the pastoral office gives no authority to en∣force
by methods of violence: these are the instru∣ments
of political authority, the authority of pas∣tors
is purely spiritual. Religious belief and prac∣tice
are of no value if they be not voluntary, if
they proceed not from conviction and conscience.
Whenever civil penalties are applied to force them,
they are misapplied. This is, impotently to at∣tempt
promoting the kingdom of Christ, by an
unnatural alliance with the kingdoms of the world.
Persecution never can be but improper; but in a
minister of the gospel it is most improper. When
irreligion, vice, or superstition, so directly affect
the proper interests of society, as to render it most
just to check them by laws, as civil crimes, the
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
enacting and executing these laws, is the province
of the rulers of the state, not of the rulers of the
church. Their authority is only a right to teach
the truths which the scriptures teach, to inculcate
the duties which they require, to rebuke and cen∣sure
the sins which they forbid, and to be listened
to while they do so: and they are entitled to sup∣port
this authority by no other engines, but the
power of persuasion and the influence of exemplary
virtue. It is the dignity which results from this
kind of authority, and it alone, that belongs to
the pastoral office.</P>
<P>The functions of the pastoral office, thus worthy
in themselves, will appear still more worthy and
important, when they are considered in relation
to their end. It is so sublime, that it reflects ho∣nour
and importance on whatever has any, even
the remotest, connexion with it; but the closer
the connexion of any functions is with it, and the
stronger their tendency to promote it, the greater
in proportion will be their moment. Exercises
mean in themselves, cease to be mean when they
are undertaken for some great or good end: then
men will glory in them, who in any other situa∣tion
would have blushed to have been found em∣ployed
in them. The functions of the pastoral
office are the natural, the direct, and proper
means of promoting the most important of all
ends: this is sufficient to ennoble such of them as
are meanest in appearance. Pastors are “watch∣men<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jer. vi. 17. Ezek. iii. 17. xxxiii. 7.</NOTE>:”
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
but it is for “the soul<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>,” the im∣mortal
part, that they watch. They are “sol∣diers<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 3, 4. Phil. ii. 25.</NOTE>:”
but it is in “the good fight of faith<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 12.</NOTE>.”
They are “labourers,” but it is “together with
God,” and in “his vineyard, his husbandry,
his harvest<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 37, 38. 1 Cor. iii. 6.—9.</NOTE>.” They are “builders;” but it is
of the “temple of God<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ver. 9, 10. 12. 16.</NOTE>.” Such metaphors,
though some of them should be supposed to be
taken from mean employments, rise in their signi∣sication,
when they are applied to the exercises of
an office which has eternity for its aim; as an
insignificant piece of canvas comes to be of great
price when it is made the ground of a capital pic∣ture.
They are intended only to express the diffi∣culties
and the labours of that profession. These
lessen not its dignity: they add to it. Some of
the most eminent offices are very laborious; but
their toils are honourable. Whenever they are of
great utility, and extensive consequence, it is noble
to encounter them, it is worthy to be indefatigable
in undergoing them, it is glorious to vanquish
them.</P>
<P>Finally, the pastoral office is important, and
ought to be reckoned honourable by the people,
because to them it is needful. The end of all its
functions is their salvation; and in proportion to
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
its necessity for this end, it is interesting to them.
It is solely for the sake of the people, that God has
appointed pastors in his church; and to the people
all their functions have an immediate relation. It
belongs indeed to every individual, to “work out
his own salvation<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 12.</NOTE>:” without his own care, as
well as the grace of God, all the labours of the
minister cannot enlighten his understanding, sanc∣tify
his heart, or save his soul. Yet the labours
of the minister are strictly necessary to the people.
With abhorrence we disclaim the false pretension,
that religious knowlege is, or ought to be confined
to the clergy: God has established no such base
or slavish dependence of reason and conscience
upon fallible men. The people, as well as their
pastors, have access to the scriptures; it is equally
their right and their duty to “search” and “know
them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">John, v. 39.</NOTE>:” and they “are able to make them
wise unto salvation<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iii. 15.</NOTE>.” But the bulk of man∣kind
are, and will always necessarily be, much oc∣cupied
about worldly affairs; and, thus occupied,
will want the inclination, the leisure, the opportu∣nities,
the capacity, the education, or the means,
requisite for collecting religious knowlege, and
fixing good impressions on their hearts. The weak,
the ignorant, the thoughtless, the dissipated, the
busy, the corrupted, have absolute need of one to
<PB N="22" REF="29"/>
instruct them, to direct them, to remind them of
spiritual things, to excite them to their duty.
Without this, very many will infallibly neglect it,
and lose their souls by the neglect. It is no exag∣geration
to say, that the future happiness or misery
of at least some of the people, depends on the
proper or the improper conduct of their teachers.
We justly complain that the pastoral office, even
when its functions are performed with the greatest
skill and care, produces not so great or happy
effects as it seems to be sit for producing: but
were that office to cease, the ignorance and wicked∣ness
of the world would soon demonstrate, that it
does produce very great and very happy effects.
It cannot be a mean employment, which is both
so necessary and so profitable to mankind. The
care of immortal souls is the most important of all
trusts: the training of them for heaven is the
most excellent of all occupations<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Pastoral Care, chap. i. Scougal's Synod Serm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thus I have evinced the importance of the
pastoral office, by shewing its dignity and excel∣lence.
Avoiding all vague panegyric, declining
indefinite declamation concerning its sanctity, I
have satisfied myself with coolly ascertaining the
real kind and degree of dignity, which it evidently
derives from the sublimity of its end, and the
worthy and interesting nature of its functions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a just Sense of the Dignity of the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH as we have described being the dignity of
the pastoral office, let us next inquire, what sen∣timents
its dignity ought to impress, both on those
who occupy it, and on those who aspire to it. It
certainly becomes them to cultivate and preserve a
sense of its importance, and likewise to render
that sense just and properly directed. It is ne∣cessary
to do both; a failure in either will be pro∣ductive
of pernicious consequences.</P>
<P>The want of all sense of its dignity, will lead
men to consider it in the low and paltry light of
only a trade or living. This would demonstrate
a very abject spirit, and it would render it every
day more abject. Considered in that light, it
must appear one of the meanest of all employ∣ments;
for there are few whose profits are not
more considerable. Men would, however, enter
on it with merely interested views. They would
long for it, as a provision. They would not
be much concerned either to qualify themselves
for its duties, or to exert themselves in per∣forming
them. They would be satisfied with re∣ceiving
the profits, though they were negligent or
little capable of doing the work. In the language
of scripture, emphatically expressive of the base∣ness
of this mercenary spirit, they would “feed
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
themselves,” and “not feed the flock<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiv. 2, &amp;c.</NOTE>,” but
leave it to be “stolen, killed, and destroyed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">John, x. 10.</NOTE>.”
It is your setting out with a high sense of the dig∣nity
and importance of your profession, and your
constantly maintaining that sense, that will best
preserve you from thinking or acting beneath it,
and will form you to such elevation of views, such
exertion, and such dignity of conduct, as be∣come
it.</P>
<P>Your sense of its dignity must not only be high,
but likewise just. As the nature of its dignity may
be misconceived, so the sense of its dignity may
be perverted: and every perversion of it will pro∣duce
correspondent ill effects on the temper and
the conduct.</P>
<P>A general and indefinite conception of the pas∣toral
office, as merely an honourable employment,
especially if it were at the same time exaggerated
and extravagant, would excite an unhallowed am∣bition
and impatience for it as a pre-eminence, till
it were obtained; and would afterwards elate the
heart with arrogance, pride, and insolence. These
passions are naturally enough produced by the ho∣nours
which consist only in distinguished rank and
titles, and which are founded wholly in imagina∣tion:
but by the dignity of the Christian ministry,
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
they cannot be produced, except it be totally mis∣understood;
for its dignity results solely from the
real utility of its functions. These are passions the
most unbecoming in the servants of the humble
Jesus, sit only to render themselves odious, and
to pervert the whole spirit and tenor of their mi∣nistrations.
Therefore, the apostle directs, that a
bishop be not an uninstructed, inconsiderate “no∣vice,
lest being listed up with pride, he fall
into the condemnation of the accuser<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">I Tim. iii. 6.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>A vague and ill-digested opinion of the sanctity
of the pastoral office, would beget the most pre∣sumptuous
kind of pride: it would give it the
blackest of all its forms: it would forge a claim to
superstitious respect and blind veneration from the
people. This is the temper which Christ reproves
so severely in the Pharisees, who “loved the up∣permost
rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
the synagogues, and greetings in the market∣places,
and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rab∣bi.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii. 6, 7.</NOTE>”
But the teachers of his religion he com∣mands,
“Be not ye called Rabbi, neither be ye
called Masters<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ver. 8. 10.</NOTE>:” exact not the admiration of
the multitude, as if you were, in consequence of
your holding an holy office, holier than they,
higher in God's favour, or possessed of any mys∣terious
power in matters of religion. An ill-defined
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
sense of the sanctity of the pastoral office
would lead us, it has led the priests of another
church, to a demand of privileges most foreign to
its real sanctity, and a licence in practices most
repugnant to every conception of holiness. It is
undoubtedly proper that we be sensible of its
being an holy office: but our sense of this must be
formed and defined by a distinct conception of the
real nature of its holiness. It is not a notion that
the mere occupation of it can render us holy; but
a settled persuasion that it will lay us under the
strictest obligation to labour to become holy, and
still more holy. It is a fixed persuasion, that un∣hallowed
hands and an unsanctified heart are unfit
to be employed in its holy functions. It is a lively
sense, that all impurity is more incongruous to the
subject of the Christian ministry, than the most
vulgar manners, the most sordid spirit, and the
coarsest sentiments, would be to the highest rank.
It is a conviction that that office gives those who
exercise it, great advantages for becoming holy;
united with a conviction that, except they be care∣ful
to improve them, they will not make them
holy, but will on the contrary confirm and harden
them in wickedness; and that the strength of their
obligations, and the greatness of their advantages,
will render the guilt of neglecting holiness heinous,
and its punishment severe. In a word, a sense
that the pastoral office will place you in a near and
peculiar relation to God, should make you to look
upon yourselves as bound to approach as near to
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
him as you can, in your temper, by strict purity,
exalted virtue, and fervent piety.</P>
<P>A just sense of the dignity of the pastoral office
must be formed and directed by a precise idea of
the nature and grounds of that dignity, and be
rendered perfectly correspondent to it. It is a
sense, that the duties of that office are of the most
excellent nature, and of the most sacred obliga∣tion,
and that it is of infinite moment that they be
discharged aright. Such a sense of its dignity,
however high it be, will produce none of those
evil passions which spring so naturally from a
vague or perverted conception of it. It can give
no encouragement to false ambition, pride, or
haughtiness: it will be the most powerful antidote
against them. It will lead you often to compare
the “treasure” of the gospel, with the “earthen
vessels,” in which “we have” it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 7.</NOTE>; the weight
of the functions, with your unworthiness and the
slenderness of your abilities; the eternal conse∣quences
which are suspended on your performance
of them, with the weakness of the means which
you can use. The comparison forced the great
apostle of the gentiles to exclaim, “And who is
sufficient for these things<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Chap. ii. 16.</NOTE>?” The comparison,
seriously made, will lead you to undertake this
office with diffidence, to be conversant in it with
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
awe, and in all its duties to “serve the Lord with
all humility of mind<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 19.</NOTE>.” Such a sense of the
dignity of your profession, carefully formed, stea∣dily
maintained, studiously cherished, and inva∣riably
acted upon, will have the happiest influence
on your views, on your exertions, and on your
whole character: and that the more effectually,
the higher it is raised.</P>
<P>A well-formed sense of the importance of your
profession will re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine and elevate your views and
aims in choosing, in undertaking, and in executing
it. It necessarily includes an impression of the im∣portance
of the end of your profession. To pro∣mote
that end, will be your principal view in en∣tering
upon it, and your leading aim in exercising
it. You will think of entering on it, with a con∣siderable
degree of deliberation; and when you
determine to undertake it, it will be with a sincere
and supreme desire, and an ardent concern, to
contribute all you can to the improvement and the
salvation of the souls of men. Liable as all men
are to indisposition, depression, and distraction of
thought, it will require pains to keep so sublime
an end constantly in view, and to act with a steady
regard to it. A lively sense of its moment is the
only means of surmounting the difficulty. This
will lead you to think explicitly of it very frequent∣ly;
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
and it will enable you to have an habitual eye
to it, even when you do not actually think of it.
It will be in perpetual readiness to occur to you,
and that with such force as to determine you to
contrive how every ministration may be performed
in the way fittest to promote it. Attention to so
sublime an end will prevent your ever subordi∣nating
any of the pastoral functions to bye-ends,
to worldly interest, or to the gratification of a sa∣vourite
passion. It will prevent your directing any
of your performances merely to the display of your
own talents, to courting the favour of the great,
or to scrambling for popularity among the multi∣tude.
It will excite you to exert your powers,
only that you may do the greater good; to
“please” others only for their “edification<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rom. xv. 2.</NOTE>,”
only when it is right to please them, and would be
wrong not to please them. Concern to accomplish
the end of your profession, is too noble a principle
to admit any partnership with mean designs. It
implies love to God, affection to Christ, the highest
species of benevolence, benevolence to the souls of
men, zeal for the advancement of religion, a con∣viction
of the incomparable importance of eternity,
all united together, deriving power from, and im∣parting
it to, one another. These will be in some
degree the principles and views of every ingenuous
candidate; whoever is wholly destitute of them,
must be unworthy to bear the sacred character:
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
these will be the principles and views of all who
are duly affected with the importance of the office,
and the great springs and regulators of all their ex∣ertions
in their profession.</P>
<P>A sense of the importance of the pastoral office,
enlightened by a distinct apprehersion of the na∣ture
of that importance, will add spirit to all your
endeavours, both in preparing yourselves for it,
and in executing it. Not dreaming that it has
such sanctity as can of itself confer virtue on the
ordinances which it is employed in dispensing, you
cannot expect that they will have virtue and effi∣cacy,
if you be incapable of dispensing them aright,
or if you be not careful to do so. Important
functions should not be performed negligently,
and cannot be performed without the proper abi∣lities.
Sensible of the importance of yours, if you
have any regard to duty or propriety, you will
decline no application that is necessary to accom∣plish
you for them, however laborious it may be,
or whatever length of time it may require. Till
you be conscious that you are sufficiently accom∣plished
for them, you will by no means think of
undertaking them. Without diligent application,
no man can excel, or even make a tolerable figure
in the very meanest profession: and can a man be
sit for so excellent an occupation, without being
indefatigable in acquiring the knowlege and habits
requisite for exercising it? The teacher of all
truth and goodness, cannot be formed in a day.
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
The importance of his office demands that he be
assiduous in rendering himself fitter for it every
day, and ready to undergo any labour that can be
conducive to his discharging it in the best manner.
It may be easy to go through all the duties of that
office, so as not to incur the imputation of omitting
them, without entering into the true spirit of any
one of them: but to be satisfied with this, is in∣consistent
with your either valuing or loving your
profession. The sense that its duties are in their
very nature worthy and honourable employments,
will not only prompt you to bring to them the re∣quisite
accomplishments, but also support and en∣liven
you in the performance of them. Mean ex∣ercises
a man enters on with reluctance, and per∣forms
with regret and languor: he is ashamed of
them, and by shame his efforts are repressed, and
his industry enervated. But you need not be
ashamed of the gospel of Christ, or of the office
of preaching it: you may glory in preaching it,
and with conscious elevation stretch all your facul∣ties
in preaching it. The sense that all the pastoral
functions are directly subservient to the greatest of
all ends, the purity, perfection, and happiness of
immortal beings, will determine you to adapt all
your studies and exercises to that end; to avoid
barren speculations, frivolous controversies, subtle
and unedifying questions; not to seek after what
may please the imagination, gratify the curiosity,
or humour the prejudices of the people: but to
inculcate only the simple doctrine of the gospel,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
which tends wholly to sanctification, and to set
every part of it in those points of view, in which
it has the strongest tendency to affect the heart, im∣prove
the temper, influence the practice, and thus
fit men for eternal life. From a lively impression
of the connexion of your functions with this end,
and of their necessity to the people, what ardor,
zeal, alacrity, and diligence in performing them,
must arise? It will make you cheerfully continue
and increase your labours, and never give them
over, till you have accomplished their end, at least
till you have freed yourselves from blame, though
they should fail of actually reaching it.</P>
<P>A lively sense of the genuine importance of the
pastoral office will have a great influence on the
whole of your character. It will powerfully insti∣gate
you to all goodness. It implies a sense of the
importance of eternal salvation, which is the end
of all the functions of that office. And with this
in your view, can you be but concerned for your
own salvation, and careful to secure it? Can you
indulge yourselves in sin, which must forfeit it, or
neglect that holiness without which it cannot be
obtained? Salvation is the most commanding ob∣ject
that you can hold forth to others, for coun∣teracting
the temptations of the world, for baffling
the power of sin, for surmounting the difficulties
of religion, for encouraging them to climb the
heights of virtue: and if you yourselves have a
constant sense of it, it is impossible that it should
<PB N="33" REF="40"/>
have no influence on your own temper and con∣duct.
It will be your very business, to teach men,
in all possible ways, “the doctrine which is ac∣cording
to godliness<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">I Tim. vi. 3.</NOTE>:” can you teach it with∣out
studying it? and can you make it the business
of your lives to study it, without feeling any thing
of its power in forming yourselves to godliness?
It is doubtless possible to go through the functions
of the pastoral office, without their having any
effect on your own souls: but it is not possible to
perform them with due attention to their nature,
or a real consciousness of their tendency, without
their having a great effect. They are the means
which infinite wisdom has ordained for reforming
and sanctifying the world: and can you uprightly
employ yourselves in applying them to this pur∣pose,
and yet yourselves remain totally unreformed
and unsanctified? A sense of the just importance
of the pastoral office, impressed on the heart, will
form you, not only to goodness, but to dignity
of character and demeanour. A station of dignity
requires dignity of character: and it is the truest
dignity of character, that the station of ministers
requires. This is widely different from that state∣liness
and haughtiness which highly misbecome
them, but which some have affected in its stead:
it is perfectly consistent with the lowliest humility;
<PB N="34" REF="41"/>
nay, in the exertions of genuine humility, it is
often most conspicuous. It exalts the soul, but
elates it not; it produces condescension, not as∣suming;
affability, not distance: it disgusts not
the most jealous spectator; it forces approbation,
and commands esteem. The apostle certainly had
it in his eye, when he directed, not to the people,
but to the minister, the exhortation, “Let no
man despise thee<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 15. 1 Tim. iv. 12.</NOTE>.” It is nothing else but
eminence of virtue. It is founded on a strong
perception of the excellence of virtue and the base∣ness
of vice, and on a permanent sense of the
vanity of present outward things, and the un∣speakable
moment of things spiritual and eternal.
It shews itself in a superiority to all the allurements
of sense and interest, whenever they are incon∣sistent
with strict virtue; in liberty from the do∣minion
of vice, which is the lowest degradation of
a reasonable soul; in the possession and vigorous
exercise of a high degree of piety, benevolence,
and every worthy affection; in disdaining to speak
or do any thing which betrays mean sentiments,
little views, or wrong passions; in being above
blushing to perform offices seemingly the lowest,
whenever they are useful to the body or the soul
of any man, or conducive to the interests of reli∣gion.
This is true dignity of character: and this
is the dignity, and the only dignity, to which
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
your profession can naturally prompt you to aspire.
A proper conception of the end of that profession
will kindle your ambition for it; acquaintance
with the subject of your profession, will form you
to it; assiduity in the duties of your profession,
will draw it out into constant exertion, and by
constant exertion will confirm and perfect it. But
the foundation both of goodness and of dignity of
character must be laid early. A person under the
full power of those sentiments which flow from a
sense of the excellence of the pastoral office, will,
from the first moment that he thinks of choosing
it, study to act in every respect suitably to its true
genius. He will study to preserve that manner
from the very first, which would be graceful and
becoming if he were already invested with the
sacred character of a minister of religion, in his
actions, in his words, in his whole behaviour.
Whatever would be declared by the general sense
of mankind indecent in a clergyman, can never
be altogether decent in a person who intends to be
a clergyman. Any behaviour unsuitable to the
character which you hope soon to bear, can pro∣ceed
only, either from blameable thoughtlessness,
from a turn of mind ill corresponding to it, or
from a desire not to have it known that you are
designed for that profession. All these are incon∣sistent
with a due sense of its dignity and import∣ance;
which will produce in you a constant soli∣citude
to speak and act worthy of it; and will
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
effectually prevent your running into any species

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Esteem due to the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>IT is incumbent, not only on those who occupy
or aspire to the pastoral office, but likewise on all
others, to have a just sense of its dignity and im∣portance.
Because it is both excellent in itself,
and highly beneficial to the people, they are
obliged to esteem it, and to think highly of it.
We are affected towards all offices, according to
our opinion of their nature: we look with con∣tempt
on those which we reckon mean; we re∣spect
those which we reckon honourable or im∣portant:
we feel these sentiments though we our∣selves
have no connexion with such offices. If the
moment of the pastoral office be measured by the
rank which it gives in the present world, or the
emoluments which it yields, men can have but a
low opinion of it. But these are not the standards
by which its dignity should be estimated. Its bu∣siness
is to teach religion; its end is to promote
the eternal happiness of mankind: its intrinsic
dignity is in proportion to these purposes; and in
proportion to men's sense of the excellence of
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
these, their esteem of it will always be. If these
appear to men, as they really are, infinitely nobler
and more momentous than all earthly riches and
honours, they cannot entertain a low idea of the
pastoral office. This would be to think meanly
of the gospel, which is the subject of it, and to set
little value on eternal happiness, which is its aim.
This is inconsistent with men's being Christians.
It demonstrates a base perversion and depravation
of sentiment. It would be inexcusable, though
the pastoral office had no immediate relation to
themselves. But when it has the nearest relation
to themselves; when it is for teaching them the
gospel, and promoting their salvation, that this
office is instituted; when, considering their want
of leisure and opportunities, they could scarce at
all obtain these purposes without it; when they
are so deeply interested in it, and that for pur∣poses
of such unspeakable consequence to their
souls; not to hold it in high esteem, shows not
merely insensibility to its nature, but also indif∣ference
about their own most valuable interests;
those eternal interests, indifference about which is
a complication of the grossest folly and the basest
degeneracy of soul. Such extravagant or mistaken
notions of the dignity or the sanctity of the pastoral
office, as were formerly mentioned, would produce
a blind and superstitious veneration of it, as per∣nicious
in its consequences as the want of all re∣spect
for it. It is only a value for it, founded on
a distinct conception of its real utility, and cor∣respondent
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
to it, that either is due, or can be
profitable.</P>
<P>The importance of the pastoral office demands
likewise from the people, respect for those who
bear it. These two sentiments, a value for the
office, and esteem of those who exercise it worthily,
are inseparable, and must in every man be in
exact proportion to one another: they who are
sensible of the importance of the work, and of its
utility to them, will “for the work's sake esteem
them very highly in love,” who labour in it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 13.</NOTE>.
In whatever belongs to their office, they are su∣perior
to the people and have an authority over
them; this implies a right to correspondent respect
and deference, the refusal of which is a failure in
duty. Whenever ministers are exercising their
office, they are doing something for the instruction,
the sanctification, or the salvation of the people:
and by being employed for purposes so beneficial
to them, they cannot but be entitled to their af∣fection
and gratitude. To refuse these attach∣ments,
is to declare that they reckon these no
services. Love and esteem will add force to one
another, and will lead them to treat ministers both
with respect and kindness, and to do them all the
good offices in their power, with an acknowleged
sense that they are due to them. An implicit de∣pendence
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
on the opinions and sentiments of mi∣nisters,
a superstitious dread of punishing their
crimes, or of vindicating the rights of other men
against them, a silly admiration of them, as if they
were beings of an higher order or endued with
supernatural powers, are no parts of the deference
that is due to them; they will be paid only by the
ignorant or the deluded, and accepted only by the
weak or the designing; they are warranted by
nothing in the real nature of the pastoral office:
but it does demand that rational esteem and love
for those who discharge it uprightly, which is
proportioned to its moment, and congruous to its
functions.</P>
<P>A person may, doubtless, by behaving un∣worthily
in his office, forfeit the esteem to which
it would have otherwise entitled him. In this
case, the very importance of the office which he
holds, will render him the more contemptible, or
the more detestable. But a real value for the
pastoral office will give some check to the severity
of men's censures, and will often even prevent
them. It is plain that they who have least respect
to the office, are generally the most forward to
find fault with individuals belonging to it, and the
readiest to pronounce that they have forfeited their
title to esteem. And by the manner of expressing
their contempt or indignation against individuals,
they betray the principles by which they are ac∣tuated:
they express it with pleasure or exultation,
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
with slight or acrimony against the office itself, or
sometimes even with a sort of triumph over religion.
Indeed, persons of very opposite pretensions some∣times
shew the same propensity to undervalue or to
censure individuals of the clergy. It is often ob∣servable
in those who profess a high sense of the
importance and sanctity of the office, and great
zeal for the interests of religion. Their idea of
the office is so overstrained as to make them exact
from those that hold it more than is reasonable,
and expect more than is practicable: or their zeal
for religion is of a false and fiery kind, embittering
their spirits, and rankling them into malevolence:
or their religion itself is of a spurious kind, dis∣posing
them to consider indifferent things as wrong,
and trivial things as momentous: or their pre∣tences
to religion are hypocritical, and overdone
in order to conceal the imposition. A real and
just sense of the importance of the pastoral office,
will extinguish the propensity to seek for faults in
ministers; and, when faults are conspicuous, will
mix the censure of them with regret, concern, and
tenderness. It is not every failing, or every im∣perfection
in virtue, that can forfeit any part of the
esteem due to a minister on account of his office:
for fallibility and imperfection are the characteris∣tics
of human nature in this mortal state. If it
could, God would never have commanded to
esteem them. Men's consciousness of their own
faults should lead them to expect some in mi∣nisters,
dispose them to bear with them, and not
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
easily to contract prejudices against them. They
are men like other men; they live in the world,
beset with the like temptations; it is not reason∣able
to expect from mortals the innocence or the
perfection of angels<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Stillingfle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Ecclesiast. Cases, vol. i. p. 105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A just and well-regulated esteem of the pastoral
office, and of those who occupy it, will render men
well affected to all their ministrations in it. In
whatever degree that office is important, in the
very same degree it is of consequence for men to
attend upon the functions of it. If it be designed
for promoting their most important interests, and
if they think highly of it on this account, they
must attend upon its functions; for without this it
can be of no advantage to them. An opinion that
the pastoral functions operate as it were magically,
merely by being performed and attended upon,
produces, in those who entertain it, a high value
for them, and a scrupulous punctuality in attend∣ing
on them: but as it springs from a wrong prin∣ciple,
it must likewise have a wrong direction. If
a rational persuasion of their real utility produce
not as great an esteem of them, and assiduity in
them, it must be owing to its being too weak, or
too little reflected upon. But the degree of re∣gard
to them, which springs from such a persua∣sion,
whatever it is, will at least be properly di∣rected.
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
It will not be merely formal; it will be
bestowed with a single view to apply them all to
themselves, and with care to render them profit∣able
for their instruction and improvement. Every
instance of disregard to the functions of ministers
betrays a defect in men's value for their office;
and every failure in improving by their functions,
shews some perversion in the manner of conceiving
the importance of their office.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Contempt of the Clergy.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the pastoral office be in its very nature
worthy and important, and entitle those who oc∣cupy
it to honour and esteem, it is too plain that
it is nevertheless very generally undervalued, and
they who hold it, spoken of with contempt or ran∣cour.
This spirit shews itself in different ways.</P>
<P>Sometimes it breaks out directly against the pas∣toral
office itself. This office is thought and spoken
of with disrespect. It is accounted mean, and de∣serving
of very little honour. In establishments
where it leads to riches or political pre-eminence,
it is reproached as prostituted to worldly views;
and in others where it can scarcely raise the occu∣piers
of it above poverty, it is despised as on that
account low and unreputable. By some it is ridi∣culed,
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
as excluding those who hold it from that
external polish, easiness of manner, and graceful∣ness
of deportment, which are found in some
other orders of men. It is sometimes even held
up to the detestation of mankind, as tending to
corrupt the moral character of those who are in∣vested
with it. By artfully confounding its na∣tural
and primary tendency, with the abuses of it
after this tendency has been resisted and defeated;
by exaggerating these abuses, and the ill effects re∣sulting
from them; and by overlooking every cir∣cumstance
in the office, which can counterbalance
them; it has been misrepresented as having a fixed
and unalterable tendency to promote in ministers
the gross vices of hypocrify, superstition, ambition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
vanity, party-spirit, rancour, and revenge<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hume's Essay on National Characters. Gerard, vol. ii.
Serm. 2. Carlyle's Synod Serm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The same spirit leads men to seek out the faults
of individuals of the clergy, to exaggerate and set
them in the most invidious lights, and to publish
them with a malicious eagerness and exultation.
Imaginary faults are converted into real vices;
small failings are exalted into atrocious crimes;
and great blemishes are condemned with the most
spiteful bitterness, and without making the least
allowance for the weakness of human nature, or
the temptations of the world. They often are not
satisfied with bitterness against the individuals who
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
are guilty: they impute them to the whole order;
they take every occasion of ridiculing and re∣proaching
all who belong to it. It cannot be de∣nied
that there is a real propensity in human na∣ture,
to ascribe the character of some individuals
with whom we are best acquainted, to the whole
society of which they are members. This is a
species of inference which it is impossible wholly
to avoid; for it is derived from that mental prin∣ciple
which disposes us to form general rules of
judging, and from which many of our most im∣portant
intellectual operations proceed. But when∣ever
we form a general rule hastily, without having
experience in a sufficient number of instances;
whenever we apply the conclusion to individuals
dissimilar to those of whom we had experience, in
the circumstances on which the conclusion was ori∣ginally
founded, however like they may be in
other circumstances; whenever we do not exercise
judgment in allowing the necessary exceptions;
that principle leads us into mere prejudices, instead
of just conclusions. From whatever cause the un∣fairness
proceeds, it is certain that our general
rules concerning characters, are much oftener
founded on the faults than on the virtues of men,
that we are readier to describe a society or nation,
by the blemishes than by the excellences of such
individuals belonging to it as we are acquainted
with. It is obvious too, that men impute the
faults of individual clergymen to the whole order,
more generally, more confidently, and with less
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
care to make exceptions, than in the case of any
other profession<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Stillingsl. Eccles. Cas. vol. i. p. 176. Secker's 1st
Charge, Oxf. Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the spirit of disaffection rests not even here.
The faults of the clergy are charged on religion
itself: the contempt of their office grows into con∣tempt
of religion. If men be dissatisfied with a
particular lawyer or physician, they commonly
content themselves at the utmost with blaming all
who are of the profession; they seldom go so far
as, on account of the faults of the practitioners,
to call in question the virtues of medicines, or the
utility of curing diseases, to revile the laws of the
land, or the institution of civil government. But,
not satisfied with despising or reproaching the
whole clerical order for the vices of a few indivi∣duals,
they would make the religion which they
teach answerable for them, and express suspicions
concerning the truth, the excellence, the import∣ance,
or the practicability of the gospel. There
may be circumstances which give a speciousness
to this partiality, and betray men thoughtlessly
into it: but still it is an unreasonable partiality,
and seems to proceed in a great measure from this,
that the depravity of men makes them more eager
to find out something to the discredit of religion,
than to that of the subject of any other profession.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="53"/>
When men's contempt of the clergy proceeds
not so far as to the contempt of all religion, yet
it often shews itself in a contempt of their mini∣strations,
and indifference for attendance on them.
These two things, contempt of their persons and
neglect of their ministrations, are nearly connected:
the transition is easy from the one to the other.
Both imply an insensibility to the importance of
the end and functions of the office. When men
are in any way prejudiced against the person, they
cannot have a great respect to his labours, nor the
expectation of much advantage from them.</P>
<P>Contempt of the pastoral office is very common
in all these forms. Whence can sentiments pro∣ceed
so repugnant to those that are naturally due
to its excellence and importance? They proceed,
in different cases, from different causes.</P>
<P>Insidelity is one very natural cause of sentiments
either of contempt or of rancour against the pas∣toral
office and those who exercise it. Atheists,
who regard all religion as weakness and supersti∣tion,
and infidels, who look on revelation as an
imposture, a false and pernicious superaddition to
natural religion, cannot have a great esteem for the
office of the teachers of religion. They must of
course either despise them as weakly credulous, or
dislike them as deceivers, carrying on a dishonest
craft, imposing upon men doctrines which them∣selves
believe not, and rules of conduct which
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
themselves know to be of no obligation. These
are the only sentiments which they can consistently
entertain. But in them alone they can appear
consistent or reasonable. In all who profess to
believe the gospel, to regard it as a divine reve∣lation
of true religion, of a stupendous dispensa∣tion
carried on by God, from the foundation of
the world, for the salvation of mankind, and exe∣cuted
by the most wonderful means; it never can
be reasonable to slight the office of teaching reli∣gion,
of propagating the principles and inculcating
the practice of Christianity, or to undervalue those
who are employed in it. To despise the order in
general, is to despise the work, and to despise the
gospel which they themselves believe; for the gos∣pel
is both the source and the subject of the em∣ployment
of that order. This is absurdity and in∣consistence
in the extreme: but it is very far from
being uncommon<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In such, the contempt of the clergy sometimes
arises from the contagion of the spirit of infidelity.
The prevalence of infidelity often corrupts the sen∣timents
and practice of those whose faith it cannot
absolutely subvert. Men adopt the maxims of in∣fidels
without perceiving their consequences; they
catch something of their spirit, while they reject
their principles. While speculative tenets often
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
have not a great or constant influence on the beha∣viour,
sympathy is so strong in human nature, that
it leads us to enter readily into the sentiments and
opinions of others, and to receive them by a kind
of infection, without considering how far they are
consistent with our own real belief. By this means,
the contempt and ridicule which infidels are na∣turally
led by their tenets to pour out upon the
ministers of religion, diffuses itself and spreads the
same spirit among those who, by their own princi∣ples,
ought to honour them<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Attachment to vicious habits and practices, not∣withstanding
a belief of the Christian religion, is
another very natural cause of disrespect or aver∣sion
to the Christian ministry. It is not surprising
that they who are addicted to wickedness, should
dislike those who endeavour to check wickedness;
or that they who hate to be reformed, should hate
those whose very business it is to labour to reform
them. Corruption of manners is often both a
cause and an effect of the contempt of the mini∣sters
of religion. Men's acknowlegement of the
religion which they teach, cannot be expected to
prevent their contempt, any more than it has pre∣vented
their own depravity; for it is not more
contradictory to the former than to the latter.
Persons of abandoned morals cannot set a proper
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
value on the persons or the office of ministers,
except they conceived a virtue in their functions,
to secure their salvation without their being obliged
to relinquish their vices; and this mistaken con∣ception
has sometimes led men of such morals to
an extravagant adulation or admiration of the
clergy, and a superstitious dependence on their
functions; as dangerous to themselves, and as
disgusting to them, as the most open contempt or
disrespect.</P>
<P>Even too low a sense of the excellence and
moment of religion, though not accompanied by
gross immorality, will sink men's esteem of the
pastoral office. As long as men are so inattentive
to the importance of eternity, as to be drawn
off from a due regard to it by every prevailing
passion or present interest, it is impossible that
they can have a just sense of the importance of an
office, which is dignified chiefly by its being
calculated for training men up for eternity. Accus∣tomed
to estimate every thing according to its
value in this world, they will respect the pastoral
office only in proportion to the degree of rank,
or weight, or influence, which it gives the possessor
in civil society; and consequently their respect will
be both too low, and of a kind that is im∣proper
and incongruous to the real nature of the
office.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="57"/>
Differences of opinion in matters of religion
sometimes contribute very powerfully to some
sort of contempt of the clergy. The adherents
to one sect, bigotedly attached to its peculiarities,
and violently set against all who differ from them,
direct their spite principally against the ministers of
other sects; reproach them as irreligious or enthu∣siasts,
as loose or over-rigid, as fools or hypocrites,
according as circumstances give the easiest handle
for one charge or another. Such abuses have
been reciprocally heaped by different parties and
different churches on the teachers of each other.
Every difference in the situation of these teachers
has been turned by the rest into a reproach against
them: their faults have been searched out, disco∣vered
with joy, exaggerated without mercy, and
turned into reasons for contempt or aversion
towards all the teachers of the same persuasion.
The dissentions of those who ought to have consi∣dered
themselves as brethren, have been greedily
laid hold of by the enemies of religion, received
with an eager faith, retorted upon them all, and
improved into a confession, that the ministers of
any denomination cannot be entitled to much
esteem. Some sects of Christians, being misled by
some of their peculiar principles to disclaim the
ministry as a separate office or profession, have, in
consequence of this, professedly despised all who
have devoted themselves to the exercise of it; and
in their ridicule or invective against them, have
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
sometimes equalled, or even surpassed, the open
enemies of all religion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Barclay's Apology. Letters on Theron and Aspasia.</NOTE> On the other hand, the
raising the measures of the pastoral duty too high,
though owing to an exalted idea of the importance
of the office, tends directly to produce contempt or
disaffection towards those who occupy it. Foster∣ing
in men an expectation of more from ministers,
than is in their power to do, they will never think
that they have done enough, and will be dissatisfied
with them after they have done all they can.</P>
<P>When these or other causes have in any degree
introduced a contempt of our order, it can
scarcely fail to spread. The giddy and inconsider∣ate
will run into it by imitation, without examin∣ation
of its justice, without reflection on its tendency,
without any settled ill design. The gay and
sprightly will choose it as an easy way of displaying
their wit and humour. The bearish will lay hold
of it, as offering a desirable opportunity of venting
their rudeness without giving general offence.
Some will affect it as a mark of politeness, of
freedom of sentiment, of superiority to vulgar
prejudices, of exemption from superstition: and
some, by depreciating the clergy, and disregarding
their functions, hope to exalt themselves as above
the need of any instruction or direction from them.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59"/>
When the spirit of contempt of ministers, and
of their office, has become prevalent, no situation,
no behaviour can procure them that honour and
respect to which it entitles them. If by the esta∣blishment
of religion to which they belong,
honours and riches be annexed to their office, they
are reproached as proud, ambitious, and covetous.
If their provision be scanty, they are despised for
their poverty, and charged with meanness of
spirit, and ungenteelness of appearance. If they
are serious and grave, it is construed into grimace,
hypocrisy, or moroseness. If they are cheerful
and lively, it is misrepresented as unbecoming
levity, or even an indication of their having no
sense of religion. The causes of all this lie not in
themselves; else, by removing them, they might
avoid it: but they lie in the giddiness, the vices,
or the prejudices of others, which they have it not
in their power to correct, and which these unfa∣vourable
sentiments of them, in a great measure,
cut them off from opportunity of endeavouring to
correct. These causes too are so various and even
opposite in different men, that if they escape con∣tempt
from one quarter, they may lay their account
with censure from another, and perhaps the more
for the very means by which they have contrived
to make that escape. All that they have in their
power is, to prepare themselves for bearing it, and
to behave with propriety under it.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="60"/>
In this situation of things, it is highly necessary
that, to a sense of the dignity and importance of
the pastoral office, you should unite a sense of the
contempt to which it is in fact exposed: and it is
no less necessary to give the sense of this contempt
a right direction and a proper regulation. If you
be not careful to direct and regulate it, it will have
a very bad effect on your temper and behaviour.
Catching by sympathy the sentiments of those who
entertain, and are forward to express, contempt
for your profession, you may contract a disposition
to despise it yourselves, and be led to speak or act
as if you were ashamed of it. Amidst a torrent of
ridicule or abuse poured out against it, the first
motions of this disposition may, from the influence
which the sentiments of others involuntarily have
upon us, be nearly unavoidable. But you should
attentively observe every tendency to it, as it
begins to rise, and immediately check it. The
seeming to dissemble your profession, the imitation
of the manners of the laity, the attempting to
throw off the clergyman, the speaking or acting
in any manner unsuitably to it, the appearing not
to have an habitual impression of its business and
its design; by suggesting that yourselves look upon
it as despicable or unreputable, will, by their sym∣pathy
with your sentiments, increase their con∣tempt
of it, and direct their contempt particularly
against you. Whatever can infuse a suspicion that
you do not love it for its own sake, and for the
sake of its employments, will lead them to consider
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
you in the pitiful light of exercising it only as a
trade for a livelihood.</P>
<P>To speak with seeming pleasure of the gaieties,
amusements, and dissipations of fashionable life,
to enter into them as far as you think decency can
at all permit you, or occasionally to go a little
farther than is consistent with the common maxims
of decorum, may procure you some external
caresses, or even some inward liking from such as
delight in them; but it will sink you even in their
esteem, and make others despise you as totally
unfit for the profession which you have chosen.
Were you to affect disclaiming your profession, by
appearing to think favourably of any vice, or slightly
of any thing which truly belongs to religion, it
might prevent the wicked, the irreligious, and the
unbelieving, from hating you, for the same reason
that they revile your office: but it would raise
their indignation against you, and their contempt
of you, as low, deceitful wretches, who live by
religion, and yet betray it. Let never your con∣sciousness
of the undeserved contempt with which
your profession is commonly treated, induce you
to speak a word, or do an action, which can be
considered as insinuating that you have a mean opi∣nion
of it, or little value for it. This would increase
their contempt of you, and render you deserving
of it. This additional contempt you have great
reason to be solicitous to avoid; and you will most
successfully avoid it by making the worthy clergy∣man
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
man always conspicuous in your demeanour. But
that contempt which is directed primarily against
your profession, and only rebounds on you as
belonging to it, when you recollect the causes
from which it proceeds, you certainly cannot be
solicitous to avoid; for if it were possible, it could
be avoided only by your being assimilated to the
insidel, the profane, the vicious, and the world∣ling<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Cases, vol. i. p. 176. Secker's 1st

<P>Instead of vainly endeavouring to avoid it by
improper means, turn it to your advantage. If
properly considered, it may be rendered produc∣tive
of very beneficial effects on your temper and
behaviour. A just and well-formed sense of the
contempt with which you and your office are liable
to be treated, will teach you not to expect all that
honour which the importance of the sacred func∣tions
might claim; and by preventing the expect∣ation
of it, will prevent the pain and mortification
of disappointment, when you miss it. It will forbid
your laying claim to excessive respect or authority,
by making you certain that it would be refused,
perhaps with redoubled slight and ridicule. You
should never indeed allow, or seem to allow, that
your profession is trivial or despicable; for this
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
would be to betray its rights: and it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is doubtless
proper at some times explicitly to vindicate it, and
avow its dignity. This is permitted to persons of
all other professions. The meanest artificer is not
blamed for speaking of the real degree of utility
which his trade possesses: a magistrate or judge
may, without incurring censure, claim and enforce
the honour that is due to his office. It is only
when men would give dignity to mean employ∣ments,
or challenge, to such as are honourable, a
respect in its nature unsuitable, or in its measure
extravagant, that they meet with either ridicule or
disapprobation. It cannot therefore be reasonable
to insist, that ministers alone should leave mankind
to throw undeserved contempt, not only upon
themselves, but upon their office also, without
daring to tell them that they are in the wrong. It
is even less reasonable to expect it from them than
from men of any other profession: it is directly
their business to point out the various duties of
men; and it cannot be incumbent on them, or
even allowable in them, to pass by those duties of
which the pastoral office is the object. Regard to
the gospel forbids it; it would be to suffer, without
reproof, an office to be vilified, which has its
foundation in the gospel. Regard to men's own
souls forbids it; it would be to suffer an office,
which was intended for their edification, to become
of no advantage to them, by their learning to
despise it. The most important interests of men,
their spiritual improvement and their everlasting
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
happiness, may be very much affected by the
sentiments which they entertain of their Christian
teachers. Yet it is certain, however unreasonable,
that such a vindication of our profession as would
be readily allowed to others, would by many be
censured as priestly pride and assuming haughtiness.
On this account, even when it becomes most
necessary, it must be undertaken with great caution
and prudence. You must not claim any honour,
either improper and undue in its kind, or extra∣vagant
in its degree; nor even any honour that
can, with plausibility, be suspected of being such.
You must express your demands with great care
and precision, avoiding every term that is pompous
or indesinite. You must rather keep considerably
below what truth and justice evidently warrant.
And with all this reserve, you must show no anxiety
to enter upon the subject, but touch it very
sparingly, and only when a proper occasion invites
it. You will most effectually gain respect by not
being over-eager to claim it. A proper sense of the
contempt with which the pastoral office is too com∣monly
treated, will likewise check the pride and
vanity which the consideration of its importance
might excite in light and inconsiderate persons,
who do not sufficiently reflect on the true nature
of that importance. Serving as a counterbalance
to these, it will have a direct and powerful tendency
to form you to a temper of humility. It will accus∣tom
you neither to court nor to set a high value on
the opinions and applauses of men; not to act
<PB N="58" REF="65"/>
with a view to them, but from a regard to what is
right in itself, to the approbation of your own
minds, and the unerring judgment of God. By
constantly laying your account with it, that you
shall incur part of the contempt which is so liberally
cast on your profession, you will be prepared for
bearing unjust reproach and obloquy without being
provoked or exasperated, and to submit to it with
patience and meekness. It will give you ample
scope for exercising these virtues, and rendering
them more and more habitual. Haughtiness or
resentment would be so far from screening you
from the contempt of those who are disposed to be∣stow
it, that they would only superadd their hatred.
By receiving it with dignity tempered by mildness,
you will most effectually convert it into respect<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Secker, Ch. 1, Oxf. Ch. 2, 3. Cant. Stillingfleet, Eccl.
Cases, vol. i. p. 179.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Contempt is necessarily disagreeable. However
much you are prepared for bearing it properly
when you meet it, it must be natural for you to
wish to avoid it; and therefore a due sense of the
prevailing contempt of the clergy cannot but excite
you to use every proper means of avoiding it, or
at least of mitigating it as much as possible. It
will excite you to avoid all such faults and failings
in your character and behaviour, as are the natural
objects of contempt; for by indulging these, you
must increase the contempt of the whole order, and
<PB N="59" REF="66"/>
together with it incur likewise personal contempt
drawn upon you justly by yourselves. It will excite
you to acquire and to endeavour to excel in those
qualifications which are acknowleged to be respect∣able:
for these will procure you a degree of personal
respect and honour, which may, in men's behaviour
to you, in a great measure, counterbalance their
disposition to despise or revile your profession.
From your education, and from the very nature of
your profession, a competent degree of knowlege
is justly expected: if you have it not, you will soon
be detected by the discerning, and thought defi∣cient
even by the ignorant: gross ignorance ex∣poses
any person to contempt, and it must expose
you to double contempt, for in you it will
appear highly shameful. Knowlege is universally
accounted estimable and ornamental: and useful
knowlege cannot fail to do you credit in the eyes
of men. A desire therefore not to stand low in
their opinion, will be a spur to you in acquiring
such a degree of it as may adorn your profession.
The acquisition of knowlege necessarily supposes
application and study: a life in a considerable
degree studious, befits your character and business,
and is necessary for preserving you from the degra∣ding
suspicion of mis-spending your time in idle∣ness
or trifles. Imprudence of every kind neces∣sarily
leads to follies, which must sink you in the
estimation of mankind, and render you sometimes
ridiculous, and sometimes despicable: your aver∣sion
to these humiliating situations cannot fail to
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
prompt you to that prudence, circumspection, and
wisdom of behaviour, which will place you out of
the reach of them. Whatever is looked upon as
mean, inevitably provokes contempt. So much
regard has been paid to this, that bodily defects
and remarkable meannesses of appearance have
been deemed sufficient to exclude men from the
priesthood in some religions: and they certainly
have so great an influence on the sentiments of
mankind, that they who have the misfortune to
lie under them, will need, and should employ, the
greater pains to acquire such respectable qualities,
conspicuous accomplishments, and shining virtues,
as may overcome that influence, and force man∣kind
to forget their exterior defects. But what∣ever
betrays a littleness of mind, narrow and con∣tracted
sentiments, or low and grovelling views, is
much more justly despicable, and will more cer∣tainly
and generally be despised. A regard to
reputation should therefore dispose you to avoid
even vulgarity and rusticity of manners, and not
to reckon the common rules of good breeding
below your attention; but much more to keep at
a great distance from all mean practices, selfish
designs, and attachment to trivial points of interest;
and to display a superiority even to considerable
worldly objects, and such disinterestedness as may
convince men that you prefer doing your duty,
and saving their souls, to any profit of your own.
Not only such vices as are reckoned degrading to
the character of every man, will subject you to
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
infallible contempt, but every vice whatever; and
by no means can you so effectually guard against
the contempt which you must naturally wish to
avoid, as by showing yourselves to be free from
every vice, and possessed of every virtue. In par∣ticular,
that wish will prove a strong preservative
against all faultiness in your own profession; for
negligence in its proper duties is one of the most
obvious grounds of contempt, and will soonest
bring it upon you; or if the irreligious and the
wicked should seem to be the better pleased with
you, the less you do in your own business, yet
even they will inwardly both disapprove and despise
you, and you must lose the good opinion of all
who have the truest value for your office, and the
warmest love to virtue and religion, and whose
good opinion alone can be really honourable to
you. That wish will be the strongest incentive to
conscientious diligence in the peculiar duties of
your profession; for such diligence will force men
to see that you are useful, and set you out of the
reach of at least many of the reproaches which
they delight in casting upon the order<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Cases, p. 178. Secker, Ch. 1. Oxf.
Ch. 1, 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have now endeavoured to represent, in a
proper light, the importance of the pastoral office
as resulting from its dignity; and to point out the
sentiments and temper with which that importance
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
requires that you enter on it, and which will pre∣dispose
you to its several duties. Its importance
ought to produce esteem of it in the people; but
as it is nevertheless very generally treated with
contempt, I have inquired into the causes of this
contempt, and shewn how you should be affected
by it, and to what purposes you should improve it.
I neither designed nor pretend to have exhausted
the subject, but only to have given such hints as
may prompt you to think of it, and pursue it for
yourselves. It will be of great advantage that you
think of it often, and seriously. It suggests many
exercises on which you may very properly put
yourselves. You may consider what are the means
by which you may best excite in yourselves a due
sense of the excellence of your profession. You
may contrive beforehand, how you could, in dif∣ferent
supposed situations, act up to it, and sup∣port
your character with propriety. You may
reflect on the several expressions of slight or
reproach which you have observed or known to
be cast upon the clergy; and you may examine in
what manner you ought to behave if you met with
them, and by what means you might most effec∣tually
escape or confute them. By frequent medi∣tation
on such topics, or even by putting your
thoughts in writing, you will render the proper
sentiments familiar to you, and will enter on your
office deeply possessed with them. Your temper will
be both congenial to your employment, and adapted
to your situation. For this purpose all the senti∣ments
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
which I have mentioned must be cherished
in conjunction: the expectation of contempt must
not suppress the sense of the dignity of your pro∣fession,
else it would either depress or mislead you:
it must only be united to it, that this sense may not
elate you, and that you may be disposed to rest
contented with the degree of respect which you
can obtain by the virtues proper to your profession,
and not court a spurious respect for qualities foreign
to your character, or perhaps misbecoming it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Difficulties of the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>THE pastoral office is rendered important, not
only by the dignity of its functions, but also
by their difficulty. As it is of great moment that
they be performed well, it is likewise no easy
matter to perform them well. To be acquainted
with its difficulties, is necessary for your knowing
how to combat and surmount them; and it will
confirm those sentiments which ought to be enter∣tained
by all who enter on that office, and which,
if they be heartily entertained, will have an exten∣sive
influence on the right discharge of all its
functions.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Nature of its Difficulties.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the difficulties of the pastoral office are
very great, is evident from the very names by which
the scripture describes those who exercise it. It is
remarkable that there is scarcely one of these that
does not imply either skill, or labour, or both; not
even those which are most expressive of their
dignity. They are called “rulers,” and said to
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
“have rule” over Christians. Every office of
government is attended with no inconsiderable
difficulty: but their's is a government of souls,
the hardest of all arts; it is the government of
men, not in respect of external behaviour and
overt acts, but likewise of the habits and disposi∣tions
of their hearts; and that too carried on, not
by violent or coërcive methods, by which tem∣poral
rulers may force obedience to the civil laws,
but solely by the gentler methods of persuasion,
which men, if they be determined on it, may more
easily refist. They are called the “ambassadors”
of God, by a metaphorical application of the name
of an employment, very honourable indeed as
implying an important trust; but which cannot be
executed without great abilities, or without the
faithful and indesatigable application of those
abilities to promote the end of the embassy, to
prevent whatever can obstruct it, to contrive every
method of forwarding it, and to maintain the
dignity and the rights of the prince whose com∣mission
they bear. They are termed “the stewards
“of God;” which implies their being employed in
the difficult task of caring for all the members of
that great family of which Christ is the head, of
dispensing to them their spiritual food, and direct∣ing
their practice in their several provinces. By a
name of the like import, they are called “bishops,”
overseers, or inspectors; to intimate the obligation
which they are under, to take heed to the conduct
and the spiritual interests of those who are com∣mitted
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
to their charge. They are called “pastors,”
or “shepherds;” by the name of an employment
very respectable in the simple and earlier ages, but
which exposed those who exercised it to great toils
and hardships, some of which Jacob describes from
his own experience, when he says, “In the day
the drought consumed me, and the frost by
night, and my sleep departed from mine eyes.”
Our Saviour, in describing himself under this cha∣racter,
represents the occupation as both difficult
and dangerous: “I am the good shepherd: the
good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep. But
he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, seeth
the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and
fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth
the sheep. But I am the good shepherd, and
know my sheep, and am known of them, and I
lay down my life for the sheep.” The epithet
is often in scripture applied to God, and is meant
to intimate his tenderest care of his church, in
respect of which he represents himself as “feeding
his flock like a shepherd, gathering the lambs
with his arm, and carrying them in his bosom,
and gently leading those that are with young.”
Such being the ideas connected with the name in
holy writ, it is plainly given to the ministers of
religion, on purpose to intimate the assiduity and
tenderness of that care which they are required to
take, of those who are entrusted to them by Christ
Jesus, “the great shepherd of the sheep;” in
feeding or teaching them, in looking after and
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
defending them, in guarding them from every sin
and error, in applying remedies to all their spi∣ritual
diseases, and in encountering every danger in
discharging these several dudes towards them.
The teachers of religion are denominated the
“ministers or servants of God;” implying that
they must labour in serving him in that work which,
by his authority and under his direction, they are
employed to carry forward in his church. They
are particularly called “labourers” in his husbandry
and his vineyard; and this designation, borrowed
from those who earn their bread by their daily labour,
and mud exert themselves diligently and constantly,
evidently implies, that the teachers of religion must
make it their daily employment, their occupation
for life, to promote the instruction and improve∣ment
of Christians; that their work is hard and
laborious; that it must be applied to with dili∣gence
and perseverance; that it will return upon
them every day; and that it can never be inter∣mitted
or given over as long as they live. They
are called “watchmen,” by a metaphor taken
from those who were placed on high towers, to
attend day and night, and to be always ready to
give the alarm on every appearance of danger;
and therefore plainly intimating, that ministers
ought to be alert in observing whatever can hurt
the souls of men, and give them warning of it;
and that for this purpose incessant vigilance and
earnest circumspection are, absolutely necessary.
They are called “soldiers,” expressly to declare
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
that their employment calls them to “endure
hardness,” to encounter difficulties, fatigues,
and dangers. Ministers are described in scripture
by so many epithets implying various kinds of
exertion, on purpose to impress them with a deep
sense that their business is difficult and laborious,
and demands vigorous application and unwearied
diligence. In like manner, the exertion incum∣bent
upon them is described in terms expressive
of its intenseness and constancy. They are ex∣horted
to “wait on,” to “study,” to “take heed
to,” to “give attendance to,” to “give them∣selves
continually to,” to “be instant in,” to
“labour in,” the several duties of their office.
Injunctions in such terms would be superfluous, if
there were not great difficulty in performing these
duties aright. But being the words of the Holy
Spirit, they cannot be superfluous; and they are
no stronger than the nature of the subject de∣mands<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Cases, vol. i. p. 179. Burnet, Past.
Care, c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The end and design of the pastoral office is so
purely spiritual, and so sublime, that it cannot be
easy for a person clothed with a mortal body, and
surrounded with worldly objects, to keep it con∣stantly
in view, and to act with a steady regard to
it. The purpose of its institution is described by
the apostle in this manner: “He gave some, apos∣tles;
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
and some, prophets; and some, evangelists;
and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfect∣ing
of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we
all come in the unity of the faith, and of the
knowlege of the Son of God, unto a perfect
man, unto the measure of the stature of the ful∣ness
of Christ<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ephes. iv. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>.” It is the business of a minister
to enlighten the understandings of men with all
religious knowlege, and to bring them to good
practice. It is not enough that he persuade them
to external blamelessness, or to abstinence from
gross vices; though often this is found to be
difficult enough, and even impracticable. But
his aim must be to prevail upon them to forsake
every vice, to extirpate all bad habits; to form
them to inward purity, to unfeigned humility, to
calm resignation, to the ardent love of God, to
that universal charity which will make them regard
the interests of others as their own; to inspire
them with the love of virtue, to exalt them to the
divine image, to raise them above the world, to
spiritualize their temper to such a degree, that
they may be fit for ascending to “Mount Zion,
and to the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of
holy angels, to the general assembly of the first∣born,
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
and to God all-pure, the judge of all,
and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and
to Jesus Christ the righteous, the mediator of the
new covenant<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24.</NOTE>.” No ministration of the sacred
office can be performed aright, except it be per∣formed
with a respect to these important ends.
But men must, without the greatest care, frequently
lose sight of them. At one time they will be
ready to go through what they must do, without
considering whether it be or be not well calculated
for answering these purposes. At other times a
regard to their own interest or reputation will mix
with and sophisticate their aims. Even when they
keep them most directly in their eye, they will
find it very difficult to discover how every part of
their business may be performed in the manner
fittest for promoting them, to force themselves to
perform it in that manner, and to continue and
increase their labour till they have done all in their
power to accomplish them. Were it incumbent
on a minister actually to attain these ends, his
work would be, not merely difficult, but altogether
impracticable: but it is incumbent on him, both
sincerely to aim at them, and to omit nothing
that he can do in order to attain them. To satisfy
himself of this, he must be conscious that he has
uniformly employed his utmost abilities and in∣dustry
in the duties of his office. How difficult it
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
is to promote these ends, with any tolerable
success, in a parish, a man may perceive by only
reflecting how difficult it is to accomplish them in
himself, or by making trial of forming any one to
whom he has the nearest and most constant access,
to such a temper and behaviour as he would wish
him to acquire.</P>
<P>The functions of the pastoral office, appointed
for promoting these ends, are in their very nature
attended with considerable difficulty. It may be
easy to go over them, and dispatch them in some
way or other: but it is a very different matter to
execute them constantly in the most useful and
improving manner. It is not difficult to discourse
fluently enough on different subjects of religion, or
to teach people to repeat explications of them by
rote: but it is both difficult and irksome to say the
same things over and over, to set them in one light
after another, to contrive a variety of illustrations,
till the dullest can really understand them. With
proper preparation and moderate care, a man may
compose a very correct discourse: but it is not so
easy to preach properly and usefully. To express
the truths and duties of religion, so plainly as to be
understood by the meanest without disgusting the
most knowing; to represent what they know
already and hear often, so as to engage their atten∣tion
and make an impression upon them; to six
the measures of duty, so as neither to alarm the
scrupulous, nor give undue licence to the lax; to
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
awaken the hardened sinner, without disturbing the
timorous with undeserved terrors; to express every
sentiment in the way fittest to give a strong con∣ception
of divine truth, and to touch the heart;
to admit no sentiment but what has a real tendency
to make men wiser and better; to reject every
thought foreign to this purpose, however fit it
might be for pleasing or gaining applause; to pre∣serve
all these views, and to be under the influence
of them, all the time a person is composing and
delivering a discourse; cannot but be arduous:
yet it is necessary to preaching well. It is still
more difficult to find out the different tempers of
all the variety of persons with whom a minister is
concerned; to discover the best ways of applying
to each; to acquire the extent of knowlege requi∣site
for these different applications; to keep it so
distinctly in view, as to be able to recollect and
make use of it as occasion requires; and after the
necessary knowlege is obtained, it is still difficult
to learn the address which must be employed in
applying to men in the several ways proper for
a clergyman, and to conduct his applications
with that prudence which will render them most
effectual.</P>
<P>The work of a minister appears, from this repre∣sentation
of it, to be abundantly difficult, though
all things should conspire in the most friendly
manner with his endeavours to promote and exe∣cute
it. But the difficulty is immensely increased
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
by the great and numerous obstructions which are
opposed to his endeavours. They arise both from
himself, and from the people. Many obstructions
must arise from the unavoidable infirmities and
imperfections of a man's own nature. It is not
easy to throw off the indisposition, which indolence
will at times produce, to his employing all the
time and pains necessary for the right discharge of
all his duties; to overcome the false tenderness
which makes it painful to declare disagreeable
truths; or the reluctance which modesty must
feel against reproving one's seniors or superiors
with becoming freedom; to attain the resolution
which will enable him to incur whatever incon∣veniences
may arise from his admonishing those on
whom his interest depends; or to encounter the
ridicule, contempt, and obloquy, to which he will
be exposed by fairly condemning prevailing errors,
fashionable evils, and polite or popular vices. Ob∣structions
at least equal to these arise from the
stupidity, the prejudices, and the vices of other
men. In order to perform the business of his
calling, a minister must infuse knowlege into
those who are so dull as to be scarcely capable of
distinct thought. He must teach those who have
very little leisure, and very little inclination, per∣haps
even an aversion, to learn. He must discover
the inward vices and depravities of those who do
all they can to conceal them from him. He must
treat with skill the diseases of the soul, which are
more latent and stubborn than many of those
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
bodily distempers which physicians find it very
hard to cure. He must make men willing to cor∣rect
faults which they fondly hug; and to con∣quer
habits which they have strengthened by thou∣sands
of acts repeated almost every day. He must
give them in an hour good impressions, which may
have strength enough to continue and influence
them for many days, in opposition to all the objects
which tend most strongly to obliterate them. He
must bring them to a temper and conduct directly
opposite to that which is powerfully recommended
to them by the example of the generality of those
with whom they converse. He must persuade
them to that from which all their corrupt passions
draw them off. He must persuade the ambitious
to slight power and honours, and to aspire only to
the heavenly kingdom; the covetous, to value no
riches in comparison with the invisible treasures
which are above; the sensualist, to sacrifice the
pleasures for which he has always had a relish, for
the sake of more refined pleasures, which he is
incapable of tasting till he be purified from the love
of external gratifications. He must bring faith
and hope to prevail over sense; and withdraw all
the affections of human nature from those objects
which solicit them most directly, and gratify them
most immediately, to objects remote or future. He
must “wrestle, not against flesh and blood only,
but against principalities, against powers, against
the rulers of the darkness of this world, against
spiritual wickedness in high places:” and in
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
order to be successful in his occupation, he must
wrestle so as to baffle all their power, and dis∣appoint
all their artifices. It is only so far as a
minister surmounts these obstacles, and, notwith∣standing
them, accomplishes the reformation and
improvement of mankind, that he attains the end
and design of his vocation. Not actually to do so
in any instance, would be to be absolutely useless in
his station: and so far as he fails by negligence in
any part of his duty, he is answerable for the
failure. But in order to effect all this in a few
instances, in order to perform what is proper for
effecting it, in such a degree as not to be really
blameable for negligence, very great pains and
labour must necessarily be bestowed.</P>
<P>I would not willingly exaggerate the difficulties
of the pastoral office: exaggeration could only
produce despondence, and, by representing them as
insurmountable, might repress every endeavour to
surmount them, and occasion an entire neglect of
every duty. But it is equally dangerous to exte∣nuate
them; it would be to deceive you; and by
thinking that you have little to do, you would be
tempted to do almost nothing, and incur all the
ill consequences of incapacity or idleness. The
difficulties which I have described are all real; they
are either expressly pointed out in scripture, or
they grow out of the very nature of the functions
and design of the pastoral office: and therefore
you ought not to dissemble them from yourselves.
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
If they require a great degree of exertion, and
suggest a high standard of duty, by having it
in your eye you will at least approach nearer to it,
than otherwise you would have even thought of
attempting. In what manner the view of them
ought to affect and influence you, and what
obligations you lie under to do your utmost that
you may surmount them, I shall next explain.</P>

<P>IT is not perhaps altogether uncommon for men
to choose the profession of a clergyman as one of
the easiest ways of gaining their bread. This
view is not more fordid than it is erroneous. If

mind: if it impose not the drudgeries which
require only muscular strength or animal agility, it
requires exertions which will at least as much
fatigue and exhaust even the body. Its difficulties
are evidently such, as ought to deter every man
from undertaking it, who is not determined to
devote himself to its duties, to make it really his
business to labour in it with assiduity. To think or
to say, “Put me into one of the priests' offices,
that I may eat a piece of bread,” betrays a total
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
ignorance and insensibility of the arduous nature of
these offices.</P>
<P>If you imagine that the occupation which you
have chosen is attended with little difficulty, the
certain consequence is, that you will be at little
pains to qualify yourselves for it; for you will
think a little pains sufficient. But by being previ∣ously
well aware of its several difficulties, by often
thinking of them, by cultivating an habitual sense
of them, you will never want a spur to diligence
in your preparation for them. You will think no
preparation too much; you will be disposed to
exceed if possible, rather than run the risk of
falling short of what is necessary. You will never
reckon yourselves perfectly prepared, but will con∣tinue
through your whole lives to become fitter for
struggling against them. A difficult work requires
both skill and diligence, in order to its being well
executed: the foundations of both must be laid in
your preparation for entering on the pastoral office.
It is not enough that you acquire all the knowlege,
a right application of which would contribute to
your right discharge of its functions: it is proper
likewise that you learn in some measure to apply it
to that purpose. You may in various ways have
opportunities of performing functions in some
degree similar to this office; to pupils, for instance,
and younger friends; and the inuring of yourselves
to these, and studying to perform them in the most
useful manner, will train you for the right execu∣tion
<PB N="78" REF="85"/>
of like functions in a more extensive sphere.
You may likewise suppose to yourselves particular
situations of difficulty, which may possibly hereafter
occur to you in the business of a minister; or you may
observe or get information of such as have occurred
to others: and you may consider deliberately how
you could most successfully exert yourselves in that
situation; and what you determine concerning it at
one time, you may examine at another time, and
alter, correct, or improve it as you find reason.
It will likewise be extremely useful, if you have
opportunity, to accompany some minister who
performs them well, in the several duties of his
parish, to observe his manner, and even to attempt
the performance of them in his presence, and by
his direction, and to receive and profit by his
remarks on your performance. I said that the
foundations of diligence, as well as of skill, must
be laid during your preparation for the pastoral
office: they can be laid only by your accustoming
yourselves to diligence in whatever you are em∣ployed,
whether your private studies, any branch
of teaching, or any other business; and particu∣larly
by accustoming yourselves readily to obey
every call to good offices or active exertion, with∣out
suffering indolence, recluseness, or the love of
study, to withhold you from them.</P>
<P>A sense of the difficulties of the pastoral office
will be a strong incentive to diligence, not only in
preparing yourselves for it, but also in performing
its duties when you shall be called to it. Under a
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
lively sense of the arduous nature of his work, a
minister will study, by all the methods of instruc∣tion,
exhortation, admonition, reproof, terror,
consolation, persuasion, in public and in private, in
their health and their sickness, amidst the dissipation
of prosperity and the depression of adversity, to
enlighten the ignorant with religious knowlege,
to form the young to impressions of truth and
goodness, to fix the unthinking, to awaken the
secure, to reclaim the wicked, to resolve the
doubting, to confirm the wavering, to strengthen
the weak, to perfect the saints. To this he will
devote his time, his strength, and all his talents.
He considers it as what properly belongs to him;
and though he cannot be every hour employed in
it, yet all other pursuits, even such as would most
laudably gratify his curiosity or his taste, and such
as are most indispensably necessary for his temporal
concerns, he will reckon only avocations in com∣parison,
subordinate to this, and cheerfully postpone,
when he has an urgent call to any part of this.</P>
<P>Under a serious view of the difficulties of the
pastoral care, the souls of men would sink, if they
were not conscious that it is the work of God, and
that God himself is engaged in it. This reflection
supports them under all their exertions, by the
hope of his assistance, and by the assurance, that if
they be not blameably deficient, he will render
their exertions successful, as far as the views and
plan of his providence permit. It will likewise
make every recollection of difficulty in their work,
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
an irresistible motive to earnest prayer for his aid, both
in qualifying them for it, and in performing it, and
for success in all their ministrations. A spirit of
devotion is absolutely necessary in all of your pro∣fession,
and will be the natural consequence of a
just sense of its difficulty, together with a due con∣sciousness
of your own weakness.</P>
<P>It is needless to enlarge on these topics. The
sentiments and dispositions which I have mentioned
flow necessarily from a view of the nature of the
pastoral office, and are by it rendered indispensably
obligatory. But a new and strong obligation to
them arises from considering farther, that a failure
in these, and the improper or imperfect execution
of that office, which will be occasioned by it, are
highly criminal, are productive of the most perni∣cious
consequences, and will render such as are
chargeable with them obnoxious to the severest
punishment. There are two distinct classes of
duties incumbent on all persons who occupy a
public station; the one, of those duties which
belong to them in common with others, as men
and Christians; the other, of such as are peculiar
to that public station in which they are placed.
The latter are no less necessary than the former to
complete goodness of character; and the neglect
of them is no less blameable, no less hurtful to
society, no less severely punishable. It is not
enough that a judge be blameless in his private life;
it is equally necessary that he execute justice in his
<PB N="81" REF="88"/>
public capacity, and promote the interests of society
by his authority and influence; and if he grossly
neglect the opportunities of doing so, or wilfully
pervert justice, he is as highly blameable as if he
had been guilty of similar omissions or injuries in
private life, as much hurts society, and can as
little expect to escape punishment from God. In
like manner, though a minister should be unblame∣able
and virtuous in common life, though he
should be chargeable with nothing that would have
been faulty if he had been only a private Christian;
yet if he have no activity in the business of his office,
no zeal for attaining its end; if he spend that
time in indolence, in amusement, in worldly busi∣ness,
or even in learned study, which ought to
have been employed in preparing him for instruct∣ing
his people to more advantage, or in doing good
offices among them; he is highly faulty and vicious.
In his station he cannot be a good man, without
being a good minister. The criminal omission or
the careless performance of the duties of his public
station, will be at least as hurtful to the great interests
of men, as positive acts of vice in his private life.
If by his negligence he suffer men to lose the
impressions of religion, or if by his unskilful and
improper methods of instructing them, he sow the
seeds of folly, bigotry, superstition, or enthusiasm,
the ill effects may continue through many genera∣tions.
He cannot be free from the blood of these
generations, nor innocent from these mischiefs,
whose incapacity or negligence gave occasion to
<PB N="82" REF="89"/>
them. So far as these were criminal, they must
expose him to severe punishment under the govern∣ment
of a righteous God<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Leechman, Syn. Serm.</NOTE>. Negligence in the
pastoral office reflects more dishonour upon God,
than negligence in any other profession, because
this profession, more immediately than any other,
regards God and religion. It is likewise produc∣tive
of worse consequences: the improper exercise
of other professions may produce particular incon∣veniences,
or promote some vices; but the im∣proper
exercise of this tends directly to promote all
vice, to obstruct all goodness, to bring religion into
discredit, and to ruin, not the greatest temporal
interests of mankind, but their eternal salvation.
Self-love, benevolence, conscience, every principle
of human nature that can have any influence on
conduct, must urge a clergyman, with their
greatest force, to avoid all negligence and impro∣priety
in the functions of his office. A crime
attended with so mischievous consequences, and
committed in opposition to so strong obligations,
must imply heinous guilt, and infer a dreadful
punishment. The scripture warns us of its de∣merit
and its punishment. God declares to Eze∣kiel,
that if he neglected to warn the wicked “man
from his way,” when God commanded him to
give warning, “the same wicked man should die in
“his iniquity, but his blood would God require at
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
his hand<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ezek. iii. 18. xxxiii. 8.</NOTE>;” and that “the shepherds who fed
not the flock,” but by their neglect suffered
them to be scattered and lost, he would “require
his flock at their hand<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Chap. xxxiv. 2—10.</NOTE>.” The first of these
declarations has a peculiar respect to the prophet's
immediate commission from God to reprove parti∣cular
persons, for their sins, in his name; but
certainly implies, that teachers who have a general
commission to warn men of all sin, are really
chargeable with their guilt, if they neglect to warn
them when they are bound to warn them. For
this is expressed in the second, which is professedly
directed to the ordinary religious instructors of the
Israelites<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Cases, vol. i. p. 109, &amp;c. Burnet, Past. Care, c. 2.</NOTE>. In the New Testament it is threatened,
that the unfaithful and unwise steward, who
neglects on abuses his trust, shall be “cut in sun∣der,
and have his portion with the unbe∣lievers<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Luke, xii. 46.</NOTE>:”
they who preach the gospel are
charged before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
who shall judge the quick and the dead at his
appearing<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 1, 2.</NOTE>,” to the greatest diligence in the
several parts of their duty; and it is plainly inti∣mated,
that in order to their being “pure from
the blood of all men,” they must be able to
“take them to record, that they ceased not to
warn every man, that they kept back nothing
<PB N="84" REF="91"/>
that was profitable unto them, but have showed
them, and taught them publicly, and from house
to house, that they have not shunned to declare
unto them all the counsel of God<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Acts xx. 19, 26, 27, 31.</NOTE>,” and that
they have declared it in the best manner that their
utmost care could enable them to do it<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Past. Care, c. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the other hand, to execute an office of so
great importance with fidelity and diligence, to
promote the improvement and perfection of the
noblest creature in this lower world, to endeavour
to save the souls of men by giving them lessons of
knowlege and virtue, to co-operate with God in
spreading happiness; is praise-worthy and glorious,
and will be crowned with a reward proportioned
to the dignity and difficulty of the work. They
who labour carefully in it “shall at least deliver
their own souls, though the wicked to whom
they give warning, turn not from his wicked∣ness,
but die in his iniquity<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ezek. iii. 19. xxxiii. 9.</NOTE>.” They shall,
we are assured, “save their own souls<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>;” and
“when the chief shepherd shall appear, they shall
receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 4.</NOTE>.”
Probably too, they shall save many of those that
“hear them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 16.</NOTE>,” and shall thence, both by the
joyful reflections of their own minds, and by the
remuneration of the God whom they served,
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
derive a very great accession to their happiness: for
“they that turn many to righteousness, shall shine
as the brighness of the firmament, and as the
stars for ever and ever<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dan. xii. 3. Leechman, Syn. Serm.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Thus all that application, diligence, and care,
which the difficulty of the pastoral office requires,
and therefore renders incumbent on those who
occupy it, is farther enforced upon them by the
most interesting motives, by alarming apprehen∣sions
of dreadful punishment in case of failure, and
encouraging prospects of a great reward in case of
sincere and faithful exertion. A constant respect
to these must be maintained; and if it be, will pre∣vent
their ever sinking under the labours of their
calling. It should likewise be steadily maintained
by you, through the whole course of your prepa∣ration
for that calling; for I doubt not that every
faulty negligence in your preparation exposes you
to some degree of the same danger, and that every
conscientious exertion in your preparation will
entitle you to some degree of the same reward;
even though you should never have an opportunity
of actually exercising it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the true Spirit of the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>WE have considered separately, the dignity and
the difficulty of the pastoral office, and pointed out
the sentiments which arise from, and are suitable to
each. But it is necessary that we accustom our∣selves
always to view them in conjunction. If we
look for no difficulty, the meeting with the smallest
will disconcert and dishearten us: and we will not
be at much pains to conquer great difficulties, if we
do not think it of some importance to conquer
them. By being viewed in conjunction, they will
suggest and impress upon us some sentiments of very
great moment, additional to those which we have
hitherto mentioned. All that I mean by this may
be expressed in this single article, that they will
infuse into us the genuine spirit of our profession.
This spirit is the immediate result of a high sense of
the importance of the pastoral office in its full
extent, as including both excellence and difficulty;
rather, perhaps, it is that sense raised to perfection,
and exerting itself with vigour in all its proper
energies.</P>
<P>Every profession has its proper spirit. All emi∣nent
artists have been fired with the spirit of their
art, and could not have become eminent with∣out
it. You too must be possessed, deeply possessed,
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
with the spirit of your profession; otherwise you
can never be eminent in it, nor even execute its
functions tolerably. The spirit of any profession is,
an eager and inextinguishable desire to succeed in
it, and a certain ardour of soul, a boldness and
enthusiasm in the exercises of it. The spirit of
your profession is, a love to its duties, a zeal to
perform them in the best manner, a warm ambition
to accomplish its end: it is the active operation of
love to God, to Christ, to the souls of men, to
truth, to goodness, to religion, raised to an exalted
pitch, and directed to the one point of animating
you, first in qualifying yourselves for the sacred
office, and next in devoting yourselves to the per∣formance
of the whole business belonging to it.</P>
<P>Nothing of the least consideration can be exe∣cuted
well by a person who does not enter into the
spirit of it. If you be destitute of the spirit of
your profession, you will be languid in every thing
relating to it. While you exert yourselves as often
as you are engaged in a favourite study, in amuse∣ment,
or in business, all exertion will forsake you
as soon as you turn to your proper occupations.
It will be a force upon you to turn to them. You
will be anxious to run over them as soon and as
easily as possible. You will content yourselves
with executing them in the most superficial manner:
and even this will be an unpleasant drudgery. You
will be glad when you have got through it: but ere
long it must return again; and this thought will
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
damp your joy. The perpetual recurrence of em∣ployments
for which you have no relish, and which
are for that reason irksome, will eat out the com∣fort
of your lives. You will live out of your ele∣ment,
and therefore with constant dissatisfaction
and uneasiness to yourselves. Whenever you must
do what belongs to your profession, it will be with
reluctance, and with regret, for being obliged to
interrupt something that is more agreeable to you.
With all the pain which it gives you, it will be but
ill done. You will exert yourselves feebly, where
the greatest vigour is absolutely necessary; and be
cold and unconcerned, where you should be fired
with ardour and zeal.</P>
<P>On the contrary, your being animated with the
spirit of your profession will make you enter with
alacrity into whatever belongs to it. It is he only
who possesses the spirit of his art, that will ever
attempt any thing great and excellent in it; and
to such attempts he will never want a powerful
impulse. If you have the true spirit of your art,
all the difficulties which lie in the way of your
becoming fit to exercise it, and of your exercising
it with success, will be so far from discouraging or
dejecting you, that they will embolden and elevate
you. It is a remarkable property of human
nature, that, when a man is heartily engaged in a
design, and resolved and fit to prosecute it, any
difficulty or opposition in the prosecution, instead
of sinking him into despondence, raises his ambition,
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
excites his courage, draws forth his strength, and
adds force to all his motions: and the greater the
difficulty is, provided it appear not to be absolutely
insurmountable, the more it invigorates and in∣spirits
the soul; the bolder and more eager it renders
a person to encounter it, and the more strenuously
he will exert himself in order to surmount it. As
the virtue of the loadstone would have remained
unknown, if iron had never been applied to it, so
the powers of the human mind could never have
fully shewn themselves, if circumstances had not
occurred which required the utmost stretch of
them. Abilities which have accomplished wonders,
would have lain for ever latent, but for opportu∣nities
which called them forth, but for difficulties
which a more languid exertion of them could not
have surmounted. An aptitude and proneness to
be in this manner invigorated and exalted by the
peculiar difficulties and labours of any profession,
is always an essential part of the true spirit of that
profession. The true spirit of your profession can∣not
fail to produce it in the highest degree. To
encounter formidable difficulties for a trifling end,
would be a romantic folly: but to find difficulty
in the pursuit of an end which we justly reckon
glorious, and on which our heart is intent, will
only animate us to uncommon activity. To find
ourselves engaged in an enterprise worthy of our
utmost exertion, and which indispensably requires
it, cannot but give a greatness to the soul, raise it
to an heroic elevation, and enable us to act with a
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
degree of force and vigour of which we should never
have suspected ourselves capable, if we had not been
thus roused to employ it. If your temper be har∣monised
with your profession, if your heart be
wholly engaged in it, the sense of the greatness of
your work will kindle your zeal to do it into a
flame; I might almost say, will quicken it into a
living principle, pervading all your ministrations,
rendering you indefatigable in them, and leading
you to perform them well.</P>
<P>By being possessed of the true spirit of your pro∣fession,
you will not only be rendered diligent in
whatever belongs to it, but you will likewise take
pleasure in it. It is in exertion and activity that
men find their highest enjoyment, There is not a
more unhappy or irksome state, than to have
nothing to do. Even difficulty is necessary to our
enjoyment. When every thing goes on with per∣fect
ease, when we meet with nothing that requires
the exertion of our powers, the mind is not suffi∣ciently
engaged or employed, it sinks into an
uneasy state of languor; it needs something to
awaken it, before it can enjoy itself or any thing
else. Its life and its enjoyment grow with the
obstructions which it is called upon to combat. In
consequence of this structure of our nature, when
men are engaged in a profession altogether suitable
to their genius and inclination, the more constantly
they are employed in it, the happier they are.
The mechanic has his chief satisfaction in working
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
in his calling however laborious, and could not live
without it; and if he have any ingenuity, a work of
some difficulty, out of the ordinary round of his
operations, raises him to a state of higher satis∣faction.
The merchant finds his pleasure in a run
of business, and could not bear to be idle. The
man who is turned for study, wishes to be em∣ployed
in it, delights in such researches as require
thought and reflection, regrets the interruptions
which he meets with, and suffers uneasiness in them.
In a word, every man who loves his occupation,
willingly and cheerfully labours in it, from morning
to evening, day after day. If you therefore suffi∣ciently
love your profession, and bring yourselves
to the temper which suits it, you will find your
natural satisfaction in being wholly taken up with
what belongs to it, as your real and proper business.
The greatest exertion in its duties will be your
delight. Far from appearing weary of them when
you are performing them, and longing till they be
over, you will joy in them even when you are
most fatigued. You will prefer them to every
other manner of employing yourselves. A long
intermission of them would give you pain. When
you are called off by them, from amusements the
most agreeable, or from studies the most favourite,
you will cheerfully embrace the call as giving you
an opportunity of applying yourselves to offices
still dearer to you. Its greatest toils, by drawing
out your hearty efforts to sustain them, will render
your satisfaction more sublime.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="99"/>
If the genuine spirit of the pastoral office be not
fully conceived by the description which I have
given of it, you will perhaps complete your idea by
attending to the accounts which the apostle Paul, in
various parts of his writings, gives of his own
exertions, in all which he was actuated by a large
portion of that spirit. Exalted and impelled by it,
he “hungered, and thirsted, and was naked,
and was buffeted, and laboured, working with
his own hands<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 11, 12.</NOTE>: suffering all things, lest he
should hinder the gospel of Christ; becoming
all things to all men, for the gospel's sake, that
he might by all means save some<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Chap. ix. 12, 22.</NOTE>; enduring all
things for the elects' sake, that they might
obtain salvation<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 10.</NOTE>.” He would very gladly have
spent and been “spent for them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii. 15.</NOTE>;” for he
accounted them his “hope, and joy, and crown
of rejoicing, in the presence of our Lord Jesus
Christ at his coming<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. ii. 19.</NOTE>.” He foreknew that
“bonds and afflictions awaited him; but none of
those things,” says he, “move me; neither count
I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish
my course with joy, and the ministry which I
have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the
gospel of the grace of God<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 23, 24.</NOTE>: yea, if I be
offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
faith, I joy and rejoice with you all<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 17.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="100"/>
The spirit of your profession is a sublime, a
celestial spirit. It is of great importance to your∣selves,
that you be deeply tinctured with it; even
in respect of the comfort and joy of your present
life, it is of very great importance to you. If
any be conscious of no spark of this spirit within
himself, and be not resolved to cherish it, he
ought by all means to relinquish every thought of
undertaking an office in which, without it, he can
be neither useful nor happy. A minister of reli∣gion,
who dislikes the business of his calling, who
has not even an ardent love to it, must lead a very
unpleasant life. He saunters away life in listless∣ness;
he turns to his proper functions with reluc∣tance;
he toils through them with distaste; he
performs them ill; and is dissatisfied with him∣self;
and from this dissatisfaction, again performs
them worse, and is more uneasy in his own
feelings and reflections. The consciousness of
performing functions so very important, in a
wrong or negligent manner, cannot but be galling.
Nothing less than the most stupid thoughtlessness,
or the most impenetrable obduracy, can prevent
its exciting the most uneasy sentiments and the
most alarming apprehensions. But if you have
the noble spirit of your profession, you will take
it for granted from the very beginning, that the
duties of your office will give you constant employ∣ment;
you will dedicate yourselves wholly to
them; you will maintain a constant solicitude to
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
perform them in the best manner; you will rouse
yourselves to the exertion necessary for doing so;
you will have high enjoyment in it; and the con∣sciousness
of it will fill you with inward satisfaction
and cheerful hope<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Past. Care, chap. 7.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Duties of the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>A JUST estimate of the dignity and difficulty of
the pastoral office, accompanied by the senti∣ments
and temper naturally resulting from it, can∣not
fail to produce, in all who have made choice of
it, a solicitude to inquire, what are the particular
duties belonging to that office, by means of which
its difficulties may be combated, and its momentous
end attained. The explication of these duties
will both confirm the general idea which I have
exhibited of its importance, and discover what its
importance requires from those who occupy it.</P>
<P>In general, it is the duty of a minister to pro∣mote
the salvation of Christians, by instructing
them in the principles and precepts of Christianity,
and leading them to the faith and obedience of
them. Whatever is conducive to this purpose,
belongs to the business of a minister: and it is
plainly a purpose which there cannot be the
slightest probability of answering without diligently
using a variety of means. A minister bears an
immediate relation to the parish in which he is
fixed; to it his labours should be particularly and
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
principally devoted; and in this capacity many
duties of different kinds are incumbent on him.
He likewise bears a relation to the church in gene∣ral;
and from it arise other duties, in some degree
different from those which are parochial. To assist
you in understanding the pastoral duties, I shall
consider them under four heads, to which they may
be all reduced:—private duties, respecting indi∣viduals;—private
duties, respecting lesser socie∣ties;—public
duties, respecting a whole parish;
—and ecclesiastical duties, respecting the church
in general.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Private Duties respecting Individuals.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems to be an opinion too prevalent, that the
only essential duty of a minister is preaching and
dispensing the sacraments, and that after perform∣ing
these, and answering a few occasional calls in
his parish, he needs do nothing more. It is not
reckoned necessary for him to converse with all his
parishioners, or to converse with them in another
manner than any other person would do. The
method of education for the ministry, it must be
acknowleged, has some tendency to lead men into
this mistake; for it is directed to their preparation
for scarcely any other part of the pastoral func∣tions.
To fit them for the more private labours
in a parish, no means are ordinarily used. Yet a
very little reflection will convince you, that there
are many private duties essential to the pastoral
office. Merely to appear in public at certain
stated times, to deliver a set discourse, to put up
prayers, and to preside in the ritual parts of reli∣gion,
cannot possibly either be adequate to the
difficulties of that office, and the importance of its
end, or come up to the lowest sense of many of
the expressions which the scripture uses in descri∣bing
it. He who does no more than this, cannot
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
be said to “take heed to the flock over which he is
overseer<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 28.</NOTE>,” scarcely at all to “take the over∣sight
of it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 2.</NOTE>.” He cannot be said to “watch in
all things<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 5.</NOTE>,” attentive in observing every thing
that can obstruct the improvement and salvation of
his people, and in readiness to remove it before its
ill effects have come to any considerable height. He
cannot be said to “watch for their souls as one
that must give account<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Heb. xiii. 17.</NOTE>.” He cannot be said
to “be instant in season and out of season<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>;”
that is, uninterruptedly and at all times, seizing
every favourable opportunity of doing some good,
and even attempting to improve such occasions as
seem to be less promising. Yet all these are terms
employed by the inspired writers in describing the
office and duties of a pastor.</P>
<P>His public duties are doubtless of very great
importance and utility: but his private duties are
of no less, perhaps of greater. Many of the
people are so ignorant, and have so little leisure
and so few advantages for acquiring knowlege, that
it is almost only by private and occasional conver∣sation
with them, or instructions to them, that they
can be prepared for understanding sermons, or
deriving benefit from them: and it is by the same
means that they can be directed to make a parti∣cular
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
improvement of the general instructions
which are given in public. Nothing, therefore,
can contribute more to the success of your public
ministrations, than private addresses, prudently
and familiarly pointed to the same end. It is ob∣vious
that the teachers of some sects acquire and
maintain a surprising influence over their adherents,
by a frequent religious intercourse with them in
private. It is perhaps the greater on account of
the superstition or the enthusiasm which is blended
with their intercourse. But certainly a rational
and sober religious intercourse, cultivated, with
equal assiduity, by a minister with his people,
would give him an influence with them, if not so
absolute, yet very considerable, and much more
useful. The better he is known to them, the
greater influence he will have upon them; and the
more perfectly he knows them, the more he will
be qualified for employing it to good purposes.</P>
<P>The private duties of the pastoral office are like∣wise
more difficult than the public. In order to
render them effectual, he must be able to discern
the different capacities and tempers of the persons
with whom he converses, to distinguish the most
successful manner of applying to each; and must
acquire a readiness in adapting himself to parti∣cular
emergencies, which occur suddenly, and
which give little time for recollection, and none for
preparation. In preaching, great assistance may
be had both from the rules of composition, and
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
from models of sermons: but in his private duties,
a minister can have much less assistance. He is
almost entirely left to learn the proper manner of
performing them, from his own reflection and
prudence; and to correct the mistakes into which
he has fallen at first, by slow degrees, from his
own growing experience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Past. Care, c. 8. Secker, Charge 1. Oxf. Charge 2,
Cant. Wilson, vol. i. p. 218.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The private duties of the pastoral office will
therefore deserve your most careful study. Such
of them as most strictly regard individuals, I shall
give you some assistance in studying, by considering
them under the following heads:—Example;—
Instruction;—Exhortation;—Counselling;—Visit∣ing
the asslicted;—Reproving;—Convincing;—
Reconciling differences;—and Care of the poor.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Example.</HEAD>
<P>I BEGIN with a duty in some respects unlike to
all others belonging to the pastoral office, and
singular in its kind, but of the greatest import∣ance;
and for both these reasons, fit to introduce
the catalogue; good example. The scripture ex∣pressly
enjoins this as one of the duties of the
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
office. Paul commands Timothy to be “an ex∣ample
to the believers, in word, in conversa∣tion,
in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 12.</NOTE>”
and Titus, to “show himself in all things a pattern
of good works<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 7.</NOTE>;” and Peter requires, as indis∣pensably
incumbent on all elders, to be “ensam∣ples
to the flock<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. v. 3.</NOTE>.” It cannot require many
words to evince, that, though all Christians are
under a real obligation to give a good example, yet
ministers are under peculiar obligations to it, as
specially their duty.</P>
<P>They are under peculiar obligations to it, because
their office gives them peculiar advantages for be∣coming
exemplarily good. A great part of the
vices of other men arises from the temptations to
which they are exposed in the course of their ordi∣nary
business. Each of them has a temporal voca∣tion,
the direct end of which does not coincide
with that of their spiritual calling, and which some∣times
therefore leads them off from the duties of it.
But ministers have no temporal vocation; their
particular as well as their eneral calling is of a
spiritual nature. Their occupation is to teach
religion, to enforce a lively sense of it, to inculcate
the practice of all virtue. Every attempt of this
kind is an act of virtue, which tends directly to
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
their own improvement. They cannot go about
their functions, without having religious and moral
considerations, precepts, motives, sentiments, ex∣amples,
or rules of virtue, often presented to their
thoughts, and impressed upon them, sometimes
with the most interesting and affecting circum∣stances.
Having so many and great advantages
arising from the very nature of their profession,
they are doubtless, in the sight of God, under a
strict obligation to exemplary goodness<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2. Burnet, Past. Care, c. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is the very end and design of their office to
recommend goodness to the love and practice of
men. A shining example of all real goodness is
the most effectual means of reaching this end. It
is needless to enlarge here upon its power: its
influence, both in directing and in exciting, is uni∣versally
acknowleged. Ministers are therefore no
less indispensably obliged to give a good example,
than to aim at the design of their calling<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Campbell's Syn. Serm.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Such example is, further, absolutely necessary
for rendering all the other means that can be used,
effectual for answering their purpose. Without
being himself virtuous, a minister cannot use any
of these means with spirit. If he be irreligious or
vicious, he cannot heartily or even sincerely oppose
irreligion and vice: he can scarcely have the
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
effrontery to attempt it. If he could put on this
effrontery, and become even so much a master of
hypocrisy as to seem to be in earnest, it would
have no effect. If his private conduct be not un∣blameable,
his doctrine cannot be regarded. If
the people see him immersed in the world all
the week, he can scarcely expect to persuade them
to renounce the love of it, by all that he can say
on the Lord's day. Warnings against sin, or
reproofs of other men's faults, come with a very ill
grace, and can have very little weight, from the
person whom his hearers know to be himself
addicted to the same or to any other vice. They
will forwardly conclude, that he himself believes not
what he says, because his life is nowise suitable to it.
They will hear him without attention, with indiffer∣ence,
with prejudice, and despise all his exhort∣ations
as mere form, as unfelt declamation. The
vicious will take encouragement from his practice,
in every thing that is faulty in their own. The
best men will hear him with distaste and even with
horror, condemning himself in what they know
that he allows and does. But when a minister is
himself uniformly pious and virtuous, he will be
able to deliver whatever regards the faith or prac∣tice
of men with force and energy. It proceeds
from his own heart; and it will be evident that his
heart is in it. He will deliver it with boldness and
freedom, unrestrained by any apprehension that
the hearers may retort upon him, “Thou which
teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?”
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
When in his life he gives an example of all the
christian virtues which he recommends, it will add
weight to all his exhortations to them. Sensible
from their effects on his own conduct, that he
firmly believes the truths of religion, men will
listen to his representations of them with attention,
with docility, and with an opinion of their import∣ance.
From his lively faith in divine truth, they
will catch, by sympathy, a like faith in it; from his
vigorous perception of it, a like perception; and
from his love of virtue, some degree of affection
to it. Convinced that he is sincere in all he says,
and that he earnestly desires their good, they will
receive it with a favourable ear, and be prepared
to allow his arguments, his directions, his admo∣nitions,
their full influence upon them<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Past. Care. Stillingfleet, Eccl. Cases, p. 65.
Secker, Ch. 1. Oxf. Ch. 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Bad example in a minister not only renders his
own instructions ineffectual, but tends likewise to
weaken the force of all religion. Concluding na∣turally
enough from his conduct, that he does not
truly believe religion, and prone to justify them∣selves
in their vices, the irreligious will allow them∣selves
to argue, that he whose business it is to exa∣mine
and to teach it, could not fail to be convinced
of its truth and to act accordingly, if it were really
true and practicable: and the weak and thoughtless
will suffer themselves to be affected by this sort of
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
arguing; and contract, if not a disbelief of reli∣gion,
at least a total indifference and inattention to
it, almost equally fatal to their souls. On the
contrary, when a minister exercises exemplary
virtue, his conduct cannot but, by the same way
of thinking, appear to the generality a strong con∣firmation
of the truth and importance of religion.
Observing that such as have had best access and
been at greatest pains to examine it, instead of dis∣covering
any fallacy in its evidences, believe it so
firmly as to yield themselves up wholly to its influ∣ence,
they are more settled in their conviction that
it is perfectly well founded, and ought to regulate
their conduct. Perceiving what effects it actually
produces in these instances, they are satisfied that
it ought to produce them, and that it is their own
fault if it produce them not in themselves, and
become better disposed to comply with its obliga∣tions.
Because a good example in ministers thus
coincides perfectly in its tendency with the very
purpose of their office, it is plainly and indispensably
their duty to teach by example.</P>
<P>This duty implies, at the very lowest, careful
abstinence, and entire freedom from all real and
acknowleged vice. Without this a minister would
give an ill example. Some vices are so positive in
their nature, and shew themselves in such obvious or
determinate acts, that they cannot fail to be ob∣served
by men, as intemperance, lewdness, lying,
injustice, swearing, expressions of impiety. These
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
will always appear scandalous in a minister, and
cannot but be generally taken notice of. It is not
enough that he does not live in these vices; it is
his duty to keep at a great distance from all appear∣ance
of them. If he be not even noted for tem∣perance,
moderation, truth, justice, and decency,
his behaviour, instead of being exemplary, will be
offensive; instead of improving, corruptive. Some
omissions of duty likewise are so palpable, that the
observation of them in a minister must give great
scandal, and tend to weaken men's sense of the
general obligations of religion; as the omission of
acts of devotion, or performing them with manifest
reluctance and indisposition when occasion plainly
requires them. A minister who allows himself in
them must do hurt by his example; his character
will be odious, and all his labours useless. Other
vices, the indications of which are more indefinite
and equivocal, or which may, by some artful
colouring, be passed on the undiscerning for virtues,
will not be so generally observed, but whenever
they are detected, will be as much detested, and
will as much enervate the influence of his ministry,
who is found to be addicted to them<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Past. Care. Secker, Ch. 1. Oxf. Ch. 2. Cant.
Campbell's Syn. Serm. Gerard, vol. ii. Serm. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But we must not stop here: we must remark
farther, that in order to render his conduct exem∣plary,
a minister must abstain from or be very
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
cautious in using many things which are, considered
simply in themselves, in a great measure, indiffer∣ent.
Of this kind are such overflowings of good
humour as approach very near to levity. Excessive
mirth will seem to indicate that the important views
and affecting sentiments which his functions tend
to bring frequently into his mind, and to render
habitual to him, have taken little hold of him, and
are forgotten and disregarded by him. Cheerful
he ought to be; but his cheerfulness should be
consistent with seriousness, recollection, and self∣possession.
Of the same kind are such amusements
and public diversions as, though perhaps innocent,
are, from an opinion of their indicating levity and
dissipation, from a misconception of them as having
some immoral tendency, or suppose from mere
prejudice, generally pronounced to be unbecoming
the character of a clergyman. From his allowing
himself in such gaieties, men will consider him as
mis-spending the time which his profession calls upon
him to apply to much better purposes; they will
suspect him to be tainted with an immoderate love
of pleasure; and seeing him go considerable lengths
in gratifying it, they will think themselves autho∣rised
to go greater lengths, till they be lost in
thoughtlessness, and divested of all attention to
their most valuable interests both in this world and
in the next. With respect to all things of this
kind, it is by no means a sufficient excuse for a
clergyman's indulging himself in them, that it is
only an example of real virtue that he is obliged
<PB N="108" REF="115"/>
to give, and that there is no virtue in abstinence
from things indifferent; or that, being convinced
of their innocence, he is at liberty to act according
to his own conviction, rather than according to the
groundless notions of other men. For no man
lives merely to himself: every man is obliged to
care, not only for his own things, but also in some
degree for the things of others; and ought in
every part of his conduct to have some thought of
how it will affect them: and a minister has a pecu∣liar
connection with mankind, which demands
from him great consideration of the influence
which every part of his conduct may reasonably
be expected to have upon their minds. It is cer∣tain
that levity, dissipation, and the love of plea∣sure,
are unbecoming the character of a minister:
it is equally certain that very many will look on
his indulging himself in the things which have been
mentioned, as an unquestionable mark of these
faulty dispositions; and therefore cannot fail to be
disgusted with the indulgence, as giving an example
of real vice. When he knows this, he cannot
be innocent in taking it; he fails in giving a pattern
in a very easy and necessary instance of self-denial,
which is a real virtue. I will venture to say far∣ther,
that indulgences of this kind, though not
implying any faulty levity in others, really proceed,
in a clergyman, from a levity that is blameable,
and a fondness for pleasure which is criminal; and
that, if he honestly examine his own heart, he will
find these to be the actual principles of his conduct.
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
For no other principle could make the gratification
arising from these to appear of such value in his
eyes, that for the sake of it he will offend multi∣tudes,
and very much lessen his own usefulness.
Accordingly, it will be found that those clergymen
who betray the strongest inclination to disregard the
common notions of decency in articles of this kind,
are not generally, if ever, the most blameless in
other parts of their behaviour, the most eminent for
piety and virtue, the most diligent in the duties of
their office, or the more zealous for its end; but
that on the contrary they shew in other matters
some fault either of the heart or of the head. It is
sometimes pled, that a minister's abstinence from
such innocent and indifferent things will lead the
weak to think that he himself condemns them, and
will foster their superstition, confirm them in their
narrow prejudices, and encourage their censorious
humour. But there is no solidity in the plea.
For, in the first place, to despise their weakness,
and violently to combat their prejudices, is not a
probable way of curing them: it tends more to
confirm them, than even compliance with them;
especially if he who acts in contempt or defiance of
them in such particulars, seem likewise exception∣able
in other respects. Besides, a minister may
abstain from what would offend, and yet let the
people know that he does so only from a tenderness
to their weakness, and that he himself is fully con∣vinced
of the lawfulness of the things from which
he abstains. When it is plain that such a decla∣ration
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
is not necessary for a vindication of himself,
it will be the better received, and the fittest for
removing their groundless prejudices. It is certain
that amusements which have at one time been rec∣koned
unreputable in a clergyman, have by a
general change of manners ceased to be thought so
at another. But such a change of manners must
be left to come on gradually and of its own accord;
it cannot be forced in an instant even by the autho∣rity
of laws; the man who attempts it by the
obstinacy of his private practice, is sure to hurt
himself. In such instances respecting the clergy,
they who are readiest to attempt it, the younger
and those of the least established and perhaps not
the most unexceptionable reputation, are the surest
to hurt themselves by it, and the most unlikely to
produce any favourable alteration in the sentiments
of mankind. But if the attempt should succeed,
what mighty advantage is gained? A little more
liberty to himself in such trifles as no wise man
can reckon of the least importance to his happiness,
and no good pastor can think worth his running
the risk of losing, for their sake, the smallest
grain of his usefulness. Perhaps too some encou∣ragement
will be given to others, in that attach∣ment
to amusement, frivolity, or shew, which is
already too prevalent, and of the most pernicious
influence: a consequence to which every sentiment
and view becoming a clergyman, should constrain him
from contributing. There is no doubt considerable
delicacy, in many cases, in determining how a man
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
had best act, with respect to giving offence by
things indifferent or of little moment. The best
general rule that can be laid down is, that a minister
ought never to do or even seem to approve any thing
that is unlawful, in order to avoid displeasing others;
but that he ought willingly to abstain from many
things which are lawful or which would be agree∣able
to him, rather than give offence to any. Such
decency is truly necessary for his teaching and edi∣fying
by example.</P>
<P>But it is not enough that he give no bad ex∣ample:
it is likewise necessary that he be a pattern
of good works to the people. In order to this it
is first of all necessary that he really be a good
man. Insincere appearances of goodness, however
artfully affected, will always be unnatural. How∣ever
studiously they be kept up, the mask will fall
off at some time or another; the detected hypo∣crite
will be despised or detested by all men: and
though he should never be detected by men, he is
abominable in the sight of God. A temper of
Christian virtue consists of many parts; a minister
must cultivate them all: were it possible that he
could possess some virtues without the rest, they
could neither atone for his defects in the judgment
of God, nor prevent scandal from them in the
judgment of the world. Virtue really prevailing
in the heart will naturally lead to good practice;
and that it may be exemplary, the proper exertions
of it must not be suppressed or dissembled. Vir∣tuous
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
dispositions which are sincere, often fail of
recommending themselves to imitation, by being
imperfectly exerted. It is only by being exerted
that they can be perceived by others; and till they
perceive them, they cannot copy after them. It
is of the most diligent practice of virtue and of the
strictest regard to religion, that ministers are bound
to be patterns. But to neglect or to disguise the
exercise of any virtue, when there is a proper op∣portunity
for it, is to neglect the virtue in that
instance, and often implies even a positive trans∣gression
of the obligations which it lays them
under. They ought, in every situation, boldly to
avow and prosecute the conduct which religion
requires from them. At the same time, they must
carefully avoid ostentation in the exertion of their
virtues. This could not fail to disgust, and would
very probably raise a suspicion of hypocrisy. They
must leave their light to shine before men by its
own splendour, without either studying to obscure
it, or endeavouring to render it glaring. It is by
possessing virtue in sincerity and in strength, that
they will best preserve this happy medium. To
render their virtue exemplary, it is likewise neces∣sary
that their manner of practising it be such as
will render it attractive. For this purpose they
must keep at a distance from forbidding austerity,
and study to shew its native loveliness by accom∣panying
it with cheerfulness, courtesy, and conde∣scension.
They must preserve the several virtues
from those excesses or adulterations which would
<PB N="113" REF="120"/>
fully their beauty. Their piety must be alike
remote from superstition and from enthusiasm;
their integrity, though inflexible, must be free
from severity; their humility, from meanness;
their gravity, from moroseness; their cheerfulness,
from levity; their zeal, from bitterness. By acting
in this manner, ministers will exhibit an insinu∣ating
example of every good quality that can
adorn the soul, and will in some measure gain both
the love and the imitation of their people.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Private Instruction.</HEAD>
<P>BECAUSE knowlege is the only foundation of
religious and virtuous practice, and must be con∣veyed
to men before they can be excited to a
becoming conduct, it is the primary duty of the
pastoral office to instruct men in the doctrines and
duties of religion. Pastors are therefore called
“teachers<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 11.</NOTE>;” and their whole office is often
described by “teaching.” Christ's charge to his
disciples, after his resurrection, was, “Teach all
nations; teach them to observe all things what∣soever
I have commanded you<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 19, 20.</NOTE>.” In conse∣quence
of this charge, his apostles “went forth,
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
and preached every where<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mark, xvi. 20.</NOTE>,” and “ceased not
to teach and preach Jesus Christ<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts, v. 42.</NOTE>.” The same
practice they expressly require from all ministers of
the gospel. “A bishop,” says Paul, “must be
apt to teach<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 2.</NOTE>:” “these things command and
teach<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 11.</NOTE>:” “these things teach and exhort<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 2.</NOTE>.”
By the practice of the apostles themselves, whom we
should regard as our examples, it is clearly ascer∣tained,
that these and the many similar precepts
require not only public preaching, but also private
instruction. The apostles at Jerusalem, not only
“daily in the temple,” but likewise “in every
house, ceased not to teach<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Acts, v. 42.</NOTE>:” and Paul appeals
to the Ephesians, that, during the three years he
had lived among them, not only publicly, but also
“from house to house, he had taught them, and
shewed them, and kept back nothing that was
profitable, and had not ceased to warn every
man night and day with tears<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Acts, xx. 20. 31.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>As these observations evidently shew that private
instruction is a duty of the pastoral office, so the
slightest attention to its nature and its consequences
is sufficient to prove that it is a very important duty.
Whoever makes the trial will soon discover that
there is, in the bulk of every parish, ignorance and
inattention enough to render it necessary. Public
<PB N="115" REF="122"/>
discourses delivered in a promiscuous audience are
almost unavoidably too uniform and general to suit
the various capacities and situations of all the
hearers. In discourses studied by a man of liberal
education, there can scarcely fail to be a degree
of composition, requisite likewise, it may be,
for preventing disgust in the more knowing,
which must render a great part of every sermon
of little use to the ignorant, who bear no incon∣siderable
proportion in all ordinary congrega∣tions.
Amends can be made only by a minister's
entering frequently into private conversation,
on religious subjects, with some or other of his
people.</P>
<P>He may in some measure, with little trouble to
himself, contribute to the instruction of all who
can read, by recommending proper books to them.
Only such books as are cheap, and written in the
plainest manner, can answer the purpose. The
greatest part of those that fall under this descrip∣tion
are very exceptionable, not only being in a
style indecently mean, but abounding in slighty,
improper, or enthusiastic sentiments. It is to be
regretted that such are most generally current
among the lower ranks, and most acceptable to
them. It were much to be wished that there were
a variety of others at least equally plain, intelli∣gible,
and familiar, but sober and wholly practical.
No compositions could be more really or exten∣sively
useful. Were there, however, the greatest
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
abundance of such, it could not supersede the
obligation which lies on ministers to give their
own private instructions to their people: but
the paucity of them must strengthen the obliga∣tion.</P>
<P>There is no doctrine or duty of religion, which
a minister may not find proper occasions of explain∣ing
or enforcing in private, or with individuals of
his parish separately. He may give them instruc∣tion
concerning many things which they know not,
and directions for particulars in their conduct,
which could scarcely be introduced into a public
discourse: he may express and illustrate them in a
more familiar manner, and set them in a greater
variety of lights, than would be allowable in
preaching, till he find that the person with whom
he converses, comprehends them perfectly: he
may descend to minuter instances of behaviour,
and to advices concerning more trivial actions,
than would be consistent with the dignity of the
pulpit. In private teaching, a minister has so
great advantage for adapting himself to the various
capacities and turns of the different persons to
whom he addresses himself, that the lower sort
will reap more benefit from half an hour of such
conversation prudently conducted, than from the
sermons of a whole year<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Wilson, vol. i. p. 215, 218, 219.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="124"/>
Whatever is of greatest importance in religion,
ought to be most frequently introduced, and most
studiously insisted on, by a minister, in his private
instructions to his people. For this reason, what
is practical will claim his chief attention. He will
soon discover that, when some of the common
people affect more knowlege than their neighbours,
it is generally of a very false and perverted kind.
They consider knowlege as best displayed in de∣ciding
questions of curiousity and difficulty: and
by reading and venting absurdities on such points,
they seem to themselves and to others of their own
rank, to be very learned, and, as they term it,
great scholars. It is not uncommon to meet with
persons in a country parish inquisitive about such
questions as these: At what season of the year
the world was created? How long the state of
innocence continued? Of what species was the
fruit of the forbidden tree? Whether original or
actual sin was first? What was the mark set upon
Cain? &amp;c. And in comparison with such trifling,
useless, or absurd questions, they despise the plain
doctrines and duties of religion, as things so easy,
that acquaintance with them requires no ingenuity,
and confers little merit. The prevalence of this
disposition renders it necessary for a minister to
take every opportunity, in private as well as in
public, to draw them off from frivolous and unpro∣fitable
subtleties and speculations, and to inculcate
on them, that the only valuable knowlege is that
which tends to influence the practice. The sort of
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
people of whom we are speaking, are always con∣ceited,
and will be abundantly forward to obtrude
their vain questions on their minister. Some of
these are perfectly unintelligible, and more of them
wholly indeterminable. In this case, the best way
is, to interrogate those who pretend to be ac∣quainted
with them, to lead them on by posing
them, till they involve themselves in contradiction
and nonsense, that thus they may be brought to
convince themselves of their absurdity. When the
questions about which they dote are intelligible,
and perhaps curious in themselves, but, like all
abstruse disquisitions, have no connection with
practice, it will be prudent for a minister, not alto∣gether
to decline answering them; for the con∣ceitedness
of the proposers would impute this to his
ignorance. Let him enter upon the subject; sug∣gest
the arguments on both sides, if it be a matter
of uncertainty, or the proofs of it, if it be only
abstruse. After having thus shewn them that he
understands it better than themselves, he may with
safety, and probably not without success, represent
such inquiries as of no moment, and inculcate
upon them, that true knowlege is only what tends
to make men better, and that religion consists in
the goodness which naturally proceeds from such
knowlege, not in the mere knowlege separated
from that effect. In both these cases, such con∣duct
is conformable to that of Christ, the great
pattern of Christian ministers. Sometimes he puz∣zled
those who attacked him, by putting apposite
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
questions, or making unanswerable remarks.
“Whether is it easier to say, Thy sins be forgiven
thee? or to say, Arise and walk<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 5.</NOTE>?” “If
Satan cast out Satan, how shall then his king∣dom
stand? And if I by Beelzebub cast out
devils, by whom do your children cast them
out<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 26, 27.</NOTE>?” “He that is without sin among you,
let him first cast a stone at her<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">John, viii. 7.</NOTE>.” “The bap∣tism
of John, whence was it? from Heaven, or
of men<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxi. 25.</NOTE>?” “Render unto Cesar the things;
which are Cesar's, and unto God the things
that are God's<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 21.</NOTE>.” “If David call him Lord,
how is he his son<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 45.</NOTE>?” On almost all the occa∣sions
to which these retorts belong, and indeed on
every occasion, and whatever was the subject intro∣duced,
he was careful to turn his discourse to
matters of practice. Not content with pointing
out the absurdity of ascribing his miracles to Beel∣zebub,
he subjoins an alarming warning of their
danger, and important maxims and directions for
their conduct, particularly as respecting their
words and conversation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Having confounded
them by his question concerning John's baptism,
he subjoined two most instructive parables, and
applied them forcibly to their practice<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxi. 28, &amp;c.</NOTE>. By the
very decision which he gave in the question concern∣ing
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
the paying of tribute, he inculcated submission
to civil government. The question concerning
the greatest of the commandments, as disputed
among the rabbis, was frivolous, regarding only
the preference of one ceremony to another: when
it was captiously proposed to Jesus, he seized the
opportunity of fixing their attention on the love of
God and of mankind, in preference to all cere∣monies<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 37.</NOTE>.
A disciple asked him, “Are there few
that be saved?” a question often moved by mere
curiosity, and that not of the most liberal or bene∣volent
kind: instead of gratifying curiosity, his
answer only points out the difficulties of religion,
and urges all present to that diligence in combating
them, without which they themselves could not be
saved: “Strive to enter in at the strait gate<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 24.</NOTE>.”
When Peter asked Jesus concerning John, “And
what shall this man do?” he both checked his
useless curiosity, and pointed out his own business:
“What is that to thee? Follow thou me<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">John, xxi. 22.</NOTE>.” In
like manner, when his disciples asked him, “Wilt
thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?”
he first intimated his disapprobation of their putting
the question; “It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons:” and next made it a
handle for giving them very important information,
that they should “receive power” by “the Holy
Ghost coming upon” them, and for turning
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
their attention to their peculiar duty, which was,
to “be witnesses unto him” every where<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Acts, i. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But
the instances of Christ's pursuing this conduct,
are innumerable. His uniform practice shews that
one of the principal subjects of private instruction,
indeed of all instruction, ought to be, to inculcate
upon men that all true religion is practical; and
that the instruction should always ultimately aim
at practice, and tend to instill such sentiments as
are fit to influence practice.</P>
<P>All private instructions are in a great measure
occasional: and it will add to their weight, that
they spring naturally from the occasion, and that
they be suitable to it. Christ has given Christian
teachers an example of address, both in seizing
every proper occasion, and in adapting their in∣structions
to it. The instances just now produced
might alone prove this: and there are many other
instances. From the common occurrences and in∣cidental
conversations which he met with, he took
an opportunity of proposing his divine instructions
to such as happened to be present. Some persons
talked “of the Galileans whose blood Pilate had
mingled with their sacrifices;” it would seem as
a piece of ordinary news: he used it as a natural
occasion, both for discouraging the spirit of rash
and presumptuous judgment, and for asserting the
<PB N="122" REF="129"/>
necessity of repentance and enforcing the exercise
of it<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Indeed, almost all his instructions were
drawn from the objects that surrounded him, or
the situations and events which occurred, at the
time. With regard to many of them, this is
evident from the relations of the evangelists; with
regard to others, it may be deduced from a com∣parison
of circumstances; and it holds so gene∣rally,
that some writers have reckoned attention
to the occasion of his discourses, as indicated by
the subject or the turn of them, sufficient for ad∣justing,
in many cases, the time and order of them,
and of the actions connected with them<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Law's Theory, p. 302—315. Lamy Harmon. passim.
Cleri a Harm. Jortin's Discourses, p. 201, &amp;c.</NOTE>. His
divine knowlege qualified him for doing this with
perfect ease and propriety. Inspiration sitted his
apostles for copying this manner of teaching; and
they copied it so much that, not only such of their
discourses as are recorded, but their writings also,
grow out of particular occasions. To uninspired
teachers, it cannot fail to be attended with consi∣derable
difficulty; and they must be liable to go
sometimes wrong in the execution of it. This
should only lead them to employ the greater pains
and study in preparing themselves for it. It can∣not
extinguish their obligation to attempt it. It is
the most easy, natural, and striking mode of in∣struction
that can be imagined; and the only
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
proper mode of private instruction. By means of
it, every thing is improved into an useful moral;
it touches the more by its congruity to the present
situation and circumstances of the hearer; and it
will be more easily retained and more affectingly
recollected, by the commonest objects and events,
as having been originally connected with it, be∣coming
ever after monitors and remembrancers
of it<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Law's Theory, p. 302—315.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is not, however, alike easy to introduce occa∣sional
instructions, to all sorts of people. Were a
minister to attempt suggesting them to most people
of rank and fashion, on as slender an occasion as
would procure them attention from the well-dis∣posed,
and at least a hearing from the common
people in general, or to pursue them with as much
freedom, he would run a great risk of being de∣spised
as a person totally ignorant of good breeding,
ridiculed as a pedant, and perhaps, in exemplifica∣tion
of their boasted politeness, abused as imperti∣nent
and pragmatical. It is only for the sake of
doing good, that religious instructions should be
occasionally suggested: when it is certain that they
can do no good, or most probable that they will
do harm, a minister can be under no obligation to
throw them away. But it is only where the case
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
is very plain, that he can be excused from every
essay: opportunities, which seem to be very unfa∣vourable,
may, by the prudent improvement of
them, turn out to real advantage. It would be
pernicious, rather than beneficial, to be constantly
obtruding religious sentiments, grave reflections,
and maxims of morality, on the conversation of
the higher ranks. A minister should be careful
not to attempt it in such a way as will prevent
those good effects, for the sake of which alone it is
incumbent on him: and in the present state of the
world, it will require very great prudence and de∣licacy
to manage it so, that there shall be a proba∣bility
of its producing good effects. Serious in∣structions
should be brought in sparingly: seldom,
except when a very natural occasion offers, and in
a manner invites them. They should not be ex∣pressed
in a sententious and authoritative way,
which carries with it a forbidding air of solemnity
and affectation. They should not be insisted on at
large, so as to turn them into formal or tedious
harangues; but just hinted at, and suggested with
the appearance of undesigning ease and good hu∣mour.
By this means they may be, on some oc∣casions,
introduced to any person, not only with∣out
giving offence, but even so as to be agreeable,
and so as to be recollected afterwards, pursued
perhaps by the person himself, and applied to their
proper use. The more difficult this is, the more
solicitous we should be to contrive a proper method
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
of doing it, and the more careful to learn the re∣quisite
address<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Secker, Ch. 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is much less difficulty in introducing reli∣gious
and moral subjects among the lower ranks.
Though they have often no great concern about
such subjects, yet their minds are not debauched
with false politeness, nor are they with-held by any
capricious ideas of fashion from proposing or listen∣ing
to them. They will think it very natural, and
very right, for a minister to pass from ordinary
talk upon common subjects, to religious observa∣tions.
He may make the transition with little ce∣remony;
and he can never want occasions of
doing so. Whatever be the conversation into
which he happens to enter with any of his pa∣rishioners,
he may find a handle for introducing
some instructive topic, without even seeming to
design it, and of suggesting remarks which will
either improve their knowlege or influence their
practice. And if it be once observed, as it very
soon will be, that a minister is ready to enter into
conversation of this kind, the people will willingly
give him opportunities of instructing them, and
even ask his assistance in explaining something
which they find it difficult to understand, or di∣recting
them in something about which they are
at a loss. When any topic is introduced, he may,
<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
without giving any offence to the common people,
dwell upon it longer, inculcate it more professedly,
and illustrate it more formally and fully, than
would be proper with those of higher rank. But
in what cases he should do so, and to what degree;
and in what cases he should simply propose, or
only insinuate instruction, will depend on many
particular circumstances, and must be left to every
man's own prudence.</P>
<P>There are very many religious subjects which the
most ordinary conversation with his people gives
a minister a natural opportunity of introducing.
Since all nature is the work of God, and all its
operations are carried on by him as the first cause,
a mountain or a valley, a river or a lake, a barren
or a fertile field, the season of the year, the pro∣gress
of vegetables, the nature and effects of the
weather, and a thousand other objects the most
common, with the conversation concerning them,
into which persons fall of course every day, natu∣rally
suggest to every thoughtful and well-disposed
person, sentiments of the divine perfections and
providence; and therefore give a minister the most
natural opportunity of speaking to any person on
these important subjects, and of making such re∣flections
as may give the ignorant juster concep∣tions
and farther knowlege of them, render the
thoughtless more attentive to them, or at any rate
excite a livelier and a more practical sense of them.
By a transition no wise forced, he may likewise
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
take occasion, from such common objects, for en∣tering
on other subjects of religion, bearing some
analogy to them, though not so intimately con∣nected
with them. Many of the sentiments of
Christ's sermon on the mount, are drawn from the
objects which that situation put into his view: a
city on a hill; persons manuring the fields with
salt; the sun shining on all the fields and gardens,
without distinction, which fell within his extensive
prospect; the fowls flying in the air, and the lilies
growing around him: he spoke of good trees and
corrupt trees, of knowing men by their fruits, of
grapes not growing upon thorns, nor figs on
thistles. The gospels contain many other in∣stances.</P>
<P>There are religious subjects suited to many of
the most common incidents, and which may there∣fore
be introduced on occasion of them. Almost
every thing that can furnish a piece of news, has
some connexion with human conduct, or with the
ways of Providence; and may be easily turned to
insinuations or remarks, concerning prudence or
imprudence, faults or excellences of behaviour, the
causes or the consequences of them, the several
phenomena of God's present government, the abuse
or the right improvement of them. The actions
of men, or accidental and trivial emergences in
company, may be improved to useful purposes.
From seeing some persons solicitous for the most
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
honourable places at an entertainment, Christ
made an easy transition to the propriety and ad∣vantages
of humility; from the hospitality of the
entertainer, to the superior excellence of deeds of
compassion; and the feast leading one of the com∣pany
to reflect on the value of spiritual enjoyments,
Christ thence took occasion to warn them of the
danger of their excluding themselves from these by
rejecting the gospel<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiv. 7, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The situation of any per∣son
whom a minister meets with, or who happens
to be spoken of, gives an opportunity for familiar
observations concerning the duties and the tempta∣tions
of prosperity or adversity, or of some pecu∣liarity
of circumstances.</P>
<P>A time of sickness or of any kind of distress,
a season or an instance of mortality, the rise or the
fall of a known individual, suggest even to the ge∣nerality
some thoughts of the vanity of the world,
the vicissitudes of human affairs, the shortness and
uncertainty of life, the approach of death: and
thus give a minister the most obvious and natural
occasions, very frequently recurring, of instilling
into any of his people who happen to fall in his
way, such sentiments on these subjects as may
awaken attention to them, and have the best in∣fluence
on practice.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="136"/>
The birth of a child, or the sight of a family
of children, gives a direct occasion of suggesting
observations concerning the proper methods of
education, the duties of parents, the nature of
baptism, its design, and the obligations which it
lays men under to holiness.</P>
<P>There are subjects belonging to religion, and of
great importance, which a minister will not perhaps
find either so frequent or so direct occasions of
sliding insensibly into, and in which it is, not∣withstanding,
necessary sometimes to give instruc∣tion:
such as, the whole dispensation of man's
redemption, and all the peculiar doctrines of reve∣lation.
These, whenever he judges it necessary,
he may very properly introduce without seeking for
any occasion, or on a very slender occasion. But
even these he will find occasions of introducing so
naturally as to take off the appearance of design,
when that appearance might do harm. Such
objects or occurrences as would serve for apt illus∣trations
of such subjects, may, by a little skill and
address, be so managed as to furnish a handle for
passing to them. On little children being brought
to him, Christ very naturally entered on the inno∣cence,
humility, and docility, which became his
disciples, or prepared men for becoming such, and
the privileges belonging to those who possess these
qualities<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mark, x. 13, &amp;c.</NOTE>. From meat and drink, he led the
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
people's thoughts to spiritual nourishment by means
of his doctrine, and participation in the blessings of
his kingdom, expressed in metaphors rising out of
the occasion<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John, vi. 47, &amp;c.</NOTE>. From the washing of the body, he
led them to the purification of the heart<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Luke, xi. 38, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Seeing
his disciples catching fish, he passed to the employ∣ment
of bringing men to his religion, to the inter∣mixture
of good and bad men in his church, and
to the final separation of them at the day of judg∣ment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. 47, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
On observing the indications of approach∣ing
summer in the trees before him, he intimated
the approach of his kingdom, and the signs of it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Luke, xxi. 29, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
On seeing the fields ripe for harvest, he speaks of
the spiritual harvest in which his disciples were to
be employed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mat. ix. 37, &amp;c.</NOTE>. From Herod's imprudent expedi∣tion
against the superior forces of the king of
Arabia, and his consequent defeat, he takes occa∣sion
to shew the danger of not considering before∣hand
the difficulties of religion<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Luke, xiv. 31, &amp;c.</NOTE>. On the frequency
of robberies in a particular place and period, he
builds the beautiful and apposite parable of the
benevolent Samaritan<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Luke, x. 30, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Among religious and moral subjects, that should
be preferred which is most suitable to the situation
of the particular person to whom instructions con∣cerning
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
them are addressed: and among subjects
equally suitable to his situation, that should at any
time be chosen, which there is the most natural
occasion of introducing. The manner both of
introducing and of inculcating instructions, should
likewise be adapted to the character and circum∣stances
of the person for whose benefit they are
intended. Some private instruction a minister
ought to give to all who are committed to his
care: but to some he will have access, and may
with propriety give it more frequently than to
others. It will be peculiarly useful to take every
opportunity of giving it to the young: their mo∣desty
will dispose them to listen to it; and the
pliableness of their minds will contribute to its
having a great influence upon them<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Secker, Ch. 2. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Private instruction may be given to persons at
their work, by the road, or in any situation. If a
minister only keep it in his view as a part of his
duty, he may apply to some person or other of his
parish almost every day, without any trouble or
inconvenience to himself. He may turn it into
little more than amusement. A walk or a ride
may be made the means of holding some useful
conversation with some of his people. This, he
should lay it down as a rule to himself not to omit
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
altogether for any day, without a good reason. I
mean not, that a minister should converse with his
people upon none but religious subjects: what has
been said concerning his seizing occasions for intro∣ducing
them implies, on the contrary, that he
should often talk with them on other subjects; and
it is by entering freely into them, and pursuing
them, that he will be best able to give them such a
turn as may most favour the easy and natural intro∣duction
of his instructions. Neither do I mean,
that he ought at all times to turn his ordinary con∣versation
with them into a religious strain, or to
moralize on whatever occurs or happens to be
said. This would be stiff and affected; and it
would be forbidding and disgusting. But between
this extreme and the other extreme of neglecting
all serious conversation, all application of common
and incidental things to purposes of piety and
morality, there is certainly a proper mean: and
this mean is, to do so on every fit occasion, and to
watch for occasions of doing so where it is necessary
or likely to prove useful.</P>
<P>A person may do a great deal, through the
course of his education and studies, in qualifying
himself for this method of private instruction. In
order to this, he should be careful to store his mind
with just and striking sentiments on all religious and
moral subjects; and to digest them so well, as to
be able to recollect them quickly when occasion
calls for them, and to express them with ease and
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
perspicuity. He may likewise receive considerable
assistance from books, even with respect to the
particular instructions suitable to common objects
and incidents, and the proper manner of taking
occasion from these to introduce them. There are
many excellent books<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ray's Wisdom of God in the Creation. Derham's Physieo∣theology, and Astro-theology. Niewentyt's Religious Philo∣sopher. Spectacle de la Nature.</NOTE> on the works of nature
considered precisely as displaying the perfections
and providence of God; in which there are like∣wise
some instances of transitions from these to
other subjects of religion. Acquaintance with such
books will furnish you with a variety of instructive
sentiments adapted to many common occasions,
and point out natural methods of applying them
when such occasions occur. There are also<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Flavel's Husbandry and Navigation spiritualized.</NOTE> books
written with a professed design to spiritualize or to
moralize the functions and occurrences of parti∣cular
occupations, or particular situations. Most
of these are exceptionable in respect of the nature
of the instructions deduced, which are too often
accommodated to the peculiarities of some one
party system, and even that none of the best; and
such instructions you should wholly and carefully
avoid borrowing. Most of them likewise are often
too fanciful, forcing an application of things to
purposes to which they are not apposite; in this
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
they ought not to be imitated: at the same time,
a remoter relation or a less perfect analogy will
justify a transition from one subject to another in
the ease of private conversation, than could render
it allowable or prevent its appearing far-fetched in
a written composition. From such books, not∣withstanding
all their faults, much assistance may,
by a judicious and wary selection, be procured,
In most books on religious and moral subjects,
sentiments are frequently illustrated by images and
comparisons drawn from familiar natural objects or
from the incidents of common life; and from
every instance of this, one may receive a hint for
some occasional instruction: he has only to invert
the order of the train of thought, to begin with
that which furnishes the image of comparison, and
from it to pass to the religious sentiment; whatever
is an apt illustration of any subject, may be im∣proved
into an occasion of naturally enough intro∣ducing
that subject into conversation. You have
access not only to such assistances in preparing your∣selves
for giving private instructions, but likewise
to exercises fit for beginning and forming a habit of
skill in giving them. You may take notice of any
thing which falls in your way that would afford a
minister an opportunity for it, or you may suppose
any situation, any incident, or any conversation
that you please; and you may consider deliberately
in what manner, if you should really meet with it,
you could turn it into a religious channel, or in a
familiar and easy strain deduce useful instructions
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
from it: you may commit the whole to writing just
as you think it ought to pass or would naturally
pass in the circumstances supposed: you may make
trials of this sort on a great variety of subjects,
and in different manners; sometimes only ex∣pressing
the supposed situation, and hinting the
instruction for which you would take occasion from
it; sometimes extending the instruction at greater
length; and sometimes carrying on the whole
minutely in the way of dialogue. Such exercises,
however unusual, may be very properly intro∣duced
into schools of Theology, and will be very
useful. Each of you may attempt something of
this kind; the choice of the occasion, the subject,
and the manner of prosecution, I leave entirely to
yourselves, but desire that you may all give some
specimen. It will require attention to, or reflec∣tion
on, common objects and ordinary incidents;
and in your first essays it may require a good deal
of thought and study, and even repeated efforts,
before you succeed; but accuracy of composition
is totally unnecessary, and would rather be im∣proper.
You may write down many such specimens
in private, when you have leisure or inclination for
it, or when you meet with any striking occasion;
and you may revise them afterwards both for cor∣rection
or improvement, and for fixing them in
your thoughts. By this means you will soon be in
possession of abundance of materials for private
instruction on most of the occasions that can occur
in a parish; and you will become gradually accus∣tomed
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
to discern the proper occasions for giving
such instruction, the nature of the instructions
which will suit them, and the best ways of passing
from the one to the other. You may do more;
you may sometimes have an opportunity of actually
giving instruction to such as are younger or less
knowing than yourselves; and will readily acknow∣lege
themselves your inferiors; and you may find
the most natural and favourable opportunities of
giving it explicitly, or at least of suggesting it,
without any risk of incurring an imputation of
pedantry, affectation, or assuming. What it
is the duty of a minister frequently to seek out
occasions of doing, it cannot be improper that
a candidate for the ministry should with modesty
and delicacy attempt doing when the occasion
invites it.</P>
<P>Thus qualified, in the first place, for giving pri∣vate
and occasional instructions; and, next, dili∣gent
in giving them in the manner, at least on the
principles, which I have pointed out; a minister
shall be always doing something for promoting the
happiness of mankind, by diffusing impressions of
truth and goodness; and may conclude every day
with the pleasing reflection, that he has not lost it.
This employment will likewise have the strongest
tendency to his own improvement in all goodness:
for by means of it, those moral and religious sen∣timents,
maxims, motives, and considerations, an
habitual sense of which is the spring whence all
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
virtuous affections and actions flow, will be ren∣dered
familiar to him, will be always in readiness
to come into his thoughts, to make a strong im∣pression
on his heart, and to exert their influence
in regulating his whole conduct.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Private Exhortation.</HEAD>
<P>EXHORTATION is often joined, in scripture, with
teaching or instruction; and often separately re∣commended
as a duty incumbent upon pastors.
“Give attendance to exhortation<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 13.</NOTE>. Exhort with
all long-suffering<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>. These things speak and
exhort<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 15.</NOTE>.” There is the same evidence from scrip∣ture
that it should be performed privately as well
as publicly; and the same reasons of necessity
and of utility hold good for the performance
of it.</P>
<P>To exhort men, is to excite them to the practice
of their several duties. Teaching and exhortation,
though different in idea, will run insensibly into
each other; and it will be impossible to perform the
one aright, without intermixing the other. As all
the principles of true religion are of a practical
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
nature, they cannot be properly illustrated without
pointing out their influence on practice; and men
cannot be urged to perform their duties, but by
insisting on those principles of religion which are
the proper motives to the performance of them.
On this account, all the general observations which
have been made, concerning the manner of intro∣ducing
and conducting private instruction, are
equally applicable to private exhortation, and need
not be repeated. But still these two duties are in
some respects different, and therefore some peculiar
observations may be made concerning this latter.
A minister should endeavour almost every day to
meet with some or other of his people, and take
occasion to admonish and exhort them, to stir them
up to the practice of some duty, to give them some
plain directions for their conduct.</P>
<P>In order to perform this duty properly, it is first
of all necessary that a minister discover the parti∣cular
situation and character of the person to whom
he addresses himself, and that he adapt his admo∣nitions
carefully to them: for the same sort of
exhortations does not suit all; and that may be
useless or hurtful to one, which is profitable to
another. As no two men are absolutely undistin∣guishable
in their faces, though every face be com∣posed
of the same features; so, though the powers
of human nature, which are the ingredients in
character, be possessed in common by all men, yet
by means of the different degrees in which they are
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
possessed, of the different form which they assume,
and of the different ways in which they are com∣bined,
they produce such an infinite variety of
characters, that no two are perfectly alike. This
renders it difficult to become acquainted with
human characters, and requires the deepest insight
into human nature. But without this it is impos∣sible
to apply to men with propriety or success.
One kind of vegetables requires one sort of culture,
and another a sort totally different. One kind of
food suits the constitution of one animal, but
not that of another. What is wholesome to a man
of one temperament, would be almost poisonous to
a person of an opposite habit. In like manner,
that may be a proper direction to one, which is
entirely useless to another; and that may be a
prevailing motive to one, which would have no
weight with another. To pay a due regard to this,
and to be assiduous in giving each person admoni∣tions
and directions peculiarly suited to himself, is
to come up to the scripture characters of a pastor.
It is to be “a faithful and wise steward, ruling
over God's household, and giving them their
portion of meat in due season<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Luke, xii. 42.</NOTE>.” It is to be
a workman that needeth not to be ashamed,
rightly dividing the word of truth<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 15.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>It is impossible, in discourses of this kind, to
point out all the variety of characters and situations
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
that you will meet with in a parish, or to explain
the proper method of applying to each. That I
may not however leave you quite at a loss, but at
least give you some hints to excite your own minds
to pursue this subject in a proper manner, I shall
mention a few instances.</P>
<P>You must admonish young and old persons in
different ways. With respect to the former, you
may reasonably assume a considerable degree of
authority, and urge them, with a sort of severity,
to virtue and improvement. Age claims a respect
which is scarcely consistent with this in ordinary
cases, and will be most effectually wrought upon by
intreaty, and mild unassuming addresses; and
therefore the apostle himself directs Timothy not
to “rebuke an elder, but to intreat him as a
“father<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 1.</NOTE>.” You must admonish the poor so as
to shew them that you do not despise them for
their poverty, and so as not to give them an
uneasy feeling of it; and you must endeavour to
comfort them under it, to guard them against the
dejection, discontent, peevishness, and dishonesty,
which are apt to arise from that state. The rich,
on the other hand, are to be addressed, so as to
shew that you have no admiration or awe of their
wealth; they are to be warned freely against the
luxury, pride, and confidence, to which their
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
situation leads, and urged strongly to that gene∣rosity,
beneficence, and alms-giving, for which
their circumstances afford opportunities; and
therefore the apostle, giving Timothy directions
concerning his behaviour to them, does not say
<HI>intreat,</HI> but “<HI>charge</HI> them that are rich in this
world, that they be not high-minded<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE>,” &amp;c. It
can never be right to stand in awe of their riches,
or to address them in a manner that would seem to
imply this; but it may be often prudent to soothe
them by the softness of your exhortations, as David
calmed the evil spirit of Saul by the charms of
music. Some men are naturally disposed to giddi∣ness,
levity, and thoughtless mirth; to these the
language of scripture is, “Wo unto you that
laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Luke, vi. 25.</NOTE>.”
In conformity to this, a minister must often pro∣pose
to such the importance, the difficulties, and
the threatenings of religion, that they may be
excited to seriousness. Others are naturally of a
sorrowful and melancholy cast; the pleasures and
the rewards of religion must be frequently exhibited
to them, that they may be encouraged in well-doing.
Some are naturally forward and even
impudent, others are modest and bashful; these
must be treated in very different ways. The for∣mer
can be affected only by severe and peremptory
injunctions; the latter will be touched with the
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
mildest insinuations. Some men are of a sanguine
and confident temper; others, of a timorous
and diffident turn: the former are to be made sen∣sible
of their weakness, that their presumption may
not precipitate them into sin; the latter must be
rendered less sensible of it before they will so much
as attempt their duty. All motives which tend to
depress the mind are proper for the former; those
which rouse and invigorate it, for the latter. In a
word, the patient and impatient, the benevolent
and the envious, the meek and the passionate, the
humble and the proud, the resolute and the
wavering, the active and the indolent, the peace∣able
and the turbulent, the prosperous and the
afflicted, the master and the servant, the parent
and the child, the man who sins deliberately and
he who is surprised into sin by a sudden passion or
the power of temptation, must be all treated in
very different manners. Both the nature of the
admonitions and exhortations which are given,
and the manner in which they are given, must
be varied according to every variety of temper and
situation in persons. In order to be able thus to
vary them, a minister must observe carefully what
directions each of his people stands most in need
of, and how they are wrought upon and affected
in the ordinary concerns of life. Natural prudence
joined with careful experience will enable him by
degrees to give them all such exhortations as they
stand in need of, in a proper manner. He should
spare no pains in studying the diversity of human
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
characters, and the manner of application which
each requires. The best assistance that you can
obtain in this, is to attend carefully to the parti∣cular
directions which the scriptures any where give
to different classes of people, and to the manner in
which they give them. By the careful study of
these, you will be able to make out for yourselves
rules for all the variety of matter and manner that
can be needful in your private exhortations in any
parish; and if you endeavour to render the rules
which you thus deduce, familiar to yourselves, espe∣cially
by writing them down and reading them fre∣quently
over, you will not be wholly at a loss for
executing this part of your duty, even at your
first settlement in a parish, and a little experience
will enable you to apply them to all particular cases,
readily and becomingly.</P>
<P>It will be proper to observe farther, that though
each peculiarity of character and situation may
require one manner of address as most suitable to
it, yet a minister should not consine himself en∣tirely
to that one manner, but should imitate the
apostles, whom we find often soothing, intreating,
beseeching, exhorting, commanding, threatening,
those to whom they write, almost in the same
breath and on the same subject. In like manner,
a minister should try every way with those with
whom he converses, touch as it were every string,
use every topic and every manner of address, till at
last he hit on one which shall be effectual. It will
be peculiarly necessary for a minister to try this
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
method at first, till he become pretty well ac∣quainted
with the characters of his parishioners;
and the making frequent trials in this way will
enable him by degrees to discover their characters
and the proper way of dealing with them. But
even after he has discovered this, it will be often
very proper to try the same variety of method;
for men are so capricious, and liable to so many
different humours, that what has great influ∣ence
with them at one time, will have none at
another.</P>
<P>It will be of great importance for the right dis∣charge
of this duty, private exhortation, that a
minister obtain from people themselves an account
of their peculiar temper, and of the difficulties
which they meet with in the virtuous conduct of
life. It is no easy matter to obtain this; for since
the particular confession established in the Popish
church, and productive of very ill effects, was
laid aside, Christians have run into an opposite
extreme, productive of almost as ill effects. In∣stead
of laying open the state of their souls to
their ministers, they endeavour all they can to
conceal it from them; so far are they from
acquainting them with the vices to which they find
themselves exposed, or the temptations which they
find it difficult to resist; from telling them, for
instance, that they find themselves covetous, pas∣sionate,
revengeful, envious, or the like; and
from asking their advice concerning the means by
which they may withstand these vices, and culti∣vate
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
the opposite virtues. In order to avoid the
inconvenience of this, a minister should keep an
eye on the conduct of his parishioners in ordinary
life, that he may observe every opening that he
can find into their characters. He should likewise
encourage them in all the ways he can, to lay their
hearts open to him, to consult him, to ask his
advice in matters of practice. Besides, when he
is engaged in conversation with them, if he possess
the address which is necessary for the execution of
his office (and this address it is certainly his duty to
study), he will, by asking questions, and by innu∣merable
methods which occasion will suggest to
him, discover their character and situation, in a
great measure whether they will or not. But if a
minister be really intent on discovering the varieties
of temper and circumstances among his people,
he will perhaps find that it is owing as much to the
minister as to the people, that they are generally so
averse, or at least so careless in asking the advice of
their pastor concerning every important step of
their lives. If he should find this to be the case,
if he should find them ready to inform him of their
situation, and to ask his advice, by his giving them
proper encouragement to do it, he will thus obtain
a very great advantage for admonishing and exhort∣ing
them, so as to promote their real improvement
and salvation.</P>
<P>It was necessary to consider these two duties,
teaching and exhortation separately, that you
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
might the better understand their nature; but I
repeat, that they are not to be in fact disjoined in
practice; every instruction should end in exhort∣ations
or admonitions; and every exhortation
should be supported with proper instructions. The
apostles command ministers both to “teach and to
exhort <HI>with all authority.</HI>” A minister should
always behave so as to command the respect of his
people, and he should maintain all the authority to
which that entitles him, in his whole intercourse
with them. The exertion of some degree of this
authority will often be necessary for keeping those
with whom he converses, from declining the sub∣jects
which he chooses to introduce, and running
off to others which better suit their relish. The
most effectual way to support this authority, so as
to gain attention to a man's private instructions and
admonitions, is to shew that they proceed from a
warm love to them, and a deep concern for their
eternal interests.</P>
<P>I will conclude this subject with repeating, that
a minister should lay it down as a rule to spend
some part of every day, except when a good rea∣son
prevents it, in giving private instructions and
exhortations in this manner to some or other of
his people, as he can meet with them. It will
really be very little labour to him; it will rather
be a pleasure, if he be fired with the true spirit of
his calling, and find his people docile and tract∣able,
which if they should not be at first, this
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
method will probably very soon render them. But
if any man think the spending a part of most days
in this manner an insupportable drudgery, let him
recollect that the end of the ministry is to render
men fit for heaven; let him judge whether all that
we have prescribed be more than sufficient for the
attainment of this end. If he think it is, he has
never considered the difficulty and importance of
the end; and if he be not willing for the sake of it
to take all the trouble that we have mentioned, he
is not, till he change his sentiments, capable of
fulfilling the ministry of the gospel, so as to save
either himself or others.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Counselling.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER private duty of the pastoral office,
which may indeed be regarded as a branch of the
former, but is at the same time so peculiar in its
nature as to deserve a separate illustration, is coun∣selling,
or giving people advice in cases of con∣science,
which they may propose to their minister.
We have the example of the apostles for this duty,
particularly of the apostle Paul, with respect to dis∣tinctions
of meats and days<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv.</NOTE>, and with respect to mar∣riage<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vii.</NOTE>”.
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
We shall content ourselves with making a
very few observations on it, such chiefly as may
prevent the abuses of it.</P>
<P>When conscience or the moral faculty is exer∣cised
about a man's own actions and temper, it
makes him solicitous to know beforehand how he
may act aright in particular circumstances, and
anxious afterwards to discover whether he has
acted right; whether he ought to approve or con∣demn
himself, and what judgment he may justly
form concerning the general temper and state of
his soul. The representation of the circumstances
on which this decision depends, is termed a case of
conscience; a case in which a man wants to have
his conscience informed and directed. To counsel,
is to give safe and seasonable advice in such a case,
to deal aright with men's consciences as to the
guilt of their sins. Before the Reformation, there
was a court for this very purpose, called the Peni∣tential
court, as well as another, the Ecclesiastical
court, for judicial cases. The latter had for its
object public offences, and for its end the enjoin∣ing
of public penances for the satisfaction of the
church, and had rules adapted to these; the former
regarded such cases as were not public, aimed at
the private direction of penitents, and had rules
different from those of the other court, and adapted
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
to the peculiarity of its own object and end, but
chiefly calculated for proportioning the kind and
degree of private penances to the nature of
offences, the circumstances of persons and actions,
and the measure of contrition. In the reformed
churches, such courts are with good reason abo∣lished;
and in ours, any formal absolution by the
minister is in such cases discharged. But for every
minister it is necessary to be able to settle doubting
consciences, to compose the troubled, and to put
men into the best method of repenting, and avoid∣ing
sin for the future<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, vol. i. c. 3. p. 211.</NOTE>. Cases of conscience may
be reduced to two general classes; such as regard
a man's conduct in a particular instance, and
such as regard the general state of a man's soul.</P>
<P>First, a man's conscience may be at a loss to
determine, what ought to be his conduct in some
particular situation, or to decide upon reflection,
whether he has acted right in that situation.
There is often real occasion for doubts on this
subject: for it is observable, that justice is almost
the only virtue which admits of absolutely precise
and accurate rules. The rules of almost all the
rest are much more loose and indeterminate; they
admit of many exceptions, and require a variety
of modifications, almost as numerous as the cir∣cumstances
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
in which they are to be reduced to
practice. The former are therefore compared,
by an ingenious author, to the rules of grammar,
which are determinate, and may be learned so as
to be infallibly observed in every case; the latter,
to those rules which critics lay down for the attain∣ment
of what is sublime and elegant in compo∣sition,
and which present us rather with a general
idea of the perfection we ought to aim at, than
afford us any certain and infallible directions for
acquiring it. A person therefore honestly disposed
to do his duty, may often be at a loss to know
what piety, generosity, friendship, gratitude, re∣quires
of him in a particular situation. The diffi∣culty
is increased by this circumstance, that
written laws, whether divine or human, must be
expressed in general terms, and the application of
them to particular cases must be left to men them∣selves.
There is perhaps no virtue except justice,
which admits of more precise rules than gratitude;
yet a very little reflection will make the difficulty
that we have hinted at, obvious. If a benefactor,
suppose, attended you in your sickness, ought you
to attend him in his? or can you fulfil the obliga∣tion
of gratitude, by making a return of a different
kind? If you ought to attend him, how long
ought you to attend him? The same time that he
attended you, or longer, and how much longer?
If your friend lent you money in your distress,
ought you to lend him money in his? How
much ought you to lend him? When ought you
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
to lend it to him? and for how long a time? It is
evident that no general rule can be laid down, by
which a precise answer can, in all cases, be given
to any of these questions. The difference between
his character and yours, between his circumstances
and yours, may be such, that you may be perfectly
grateful, and yet justly refuse to lend him any
thing; and on the contrary, you may be willing
to lend, or even to give him ten times the sum
which he lent you, and yet justly be accused of
the blackest ingratitude, and of not having fulfilled
the hundredth part of the obligation you lie under.
This want of precision in the rules of most moral
and christian virtues has disposed persons of tender
consciences to desire determinate directions for
their conduct in particular instances, and has dis∣posed
others to turn casuistry into a science for their
direction. The cultivation of this science was
greatly promoted in the middle and latter ages of
the church, by the established custom of auricular
confession. By that institution the most secret
actions, and even the thoughts of every person,
which could be suspected of receding, in the smallest
degree, from the rules of christian purity and
virtue, were to be revealed to the confessor. The
confessor informed his penitents, whether, and in
what respect they had violated their duty, and
what pennance it behoved them to undergo,
before he could absolve them in the name of the
offended Deity. To be qualified to be a confessor,
was a necessary part of the study of divines; and
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
they were thence led to collect cases of nice and
delicate situations, in which it is hard to determine
how to act. Such collections they thought might
be of use, both to the directors of consciences, and
to those who were to be directed.</P>
<P>It happened, however, as might have been ex∣pected,
that the want of precision in the rules for
the exercise of most virtues in particular situations,
which seemed to render casuistry necessary, ren∣dered
it at the same time imperfect, and in a great
measure useless; for it made it impossible to lay
down exact and precise rules for the direction of
every circumstance of men's behaviour. It was
hinted before, that one virtue, justice, admits of
very exact rules. These are subject to no excep∣tions
or modifications, but such as may be ascer∣tained
as accurately as the rules themselves, and
generally indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low from the very same prin∣ciples.
What we ought in strict justice to per∣form,
how much we ought to perform, when
and where we ought to perform it, the whole
nature and circumstances of the action prescribed,
are all precisely fixed and determined. Accord∣ingly,
the whole of jurisprudence is employed
in determining the particular laws of justice;
and as long as we keep to the precise prin∣ciples
and views of jurisprudence, it is easy to de∣termine
them with absolute certainty and perfect
exactness. The principles of jurisprudence lead a
person to consider, only what the man to whom the
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
obligation is due ought to think himself entitled
to exact by force, what every impartial spectator
would approve of him for exacting, what a judge
or arbiter, to whom he had submitted his cause,
and who had undertaken to do him justice, ought
to oblige the other person to suffer or to perform.
But even with respect to justice, casuistry does
not give so clear decisions; it is not its aim to
teach a man how he must act so as to avoid deserv∣ing
external punishment, but how he must act so
as to be a good man, and to deserve praise by his
exact and scrupulous behaviour. Casuists do not
consider so much what it is that might properly be
exacted by force, as what it is that the person who
owes the obligation ought to think himself bound
to perform from the most sacred and scrupulous
regard to the general rules of justice, and from the
most conscientious dread, either of wronging his
neighbour, or of violating the integrity of his own
character. To decide matters of conduct in this
point of view is of much greater delicacy, and the
decision must be more indeterminate. An instance
that is very commonly debated will illustrate this.
A highwayman, by the fear of death, obliges a tra∣veller
to promise him a sum of money. Is such a
promise, extorted in this manner by unjust force,
to be regarded as obligatory? Consider it merely
as a question of jurisprudence, the decision can
admit of no doubt. It would be absurd to suppose
that the highwayman can be entitled to use force
to constrain the other to perform. To extort the
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
promise was a crime that deserved severe punish∣ment;
and to extort the performance of it would
only be adding a new crime to the former. To
suppose that a judge ought to enforce the obliga∣tion
of such promises, or that a magistrate ought to
allow them to sustain action at law, would be the
most ridiculous of all absurdities. But if we con∣sider
it as a question of casuistry, as a case of con∣science
in which a good man wants direction, it will
not be so easily determined. Whether a man does
not owe some regard even to a promise thus
unjustly extorted, from a respect to his own dig∣nity
and honour, from abhorrence of all treachery
and falsehood, may very readily be made a question,
and has divided the opinions of casuists. Accord∣ing
to the sentiments of good men, some regard is
due to such a promise: but it is impossible to
determine how much, by any general rule that will
apply to all cases without exception. If the deci∣sions
of casuists, even concerning cases of justice,
are thus necessarily indeterminate, they must be
much more so with respect to other virtues, which,
from their very nature, scarcely admit of any pre∣cise
and accurate rules. But though this circum∣stance
renders casuistry, when formed into a science,
and reduced to a system, in a great measure preca∣rious
and useless, yet still it would be of great use
that people consulted their minister in all points of
conduct that are of importance. They could
represent to him the present case in all its circum∣stances;
and however difficult it is to form a
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
general rule of conduct, yet it is easy to give particu∣lar
directions for one case. Though the decisions of
casuists were just, weak people could gain little ad∣vantage
by consulting them, because though multi∣tudes
of cases are collected in them, yet there is an
infinite variety of possible circumstances, and it is a
chance if one be found exactly parallel to the present.
But a minister of prudence and virtue may give
them always a decision precisely suited to the pre∣sent
case, and can vary it according to every the
minutest variety of situation; and thus accommo∣date
it even to those virtues which admit least of
precise and accurate general rules.</P>
<P>When a minister is consulted beforehand, he
should most carefully avoid whatever can have the
remotest tendency to teach men to chicane with
their own consciences, or to authorise by vain
subtleties innumerable evasive refinements with
regard to the several articles of duty. In fact,
this is the end to which casuistry has been often
applied, not to direct the well-meaning to real
virtue, but to enable the dishonest to explain away
their duty. He should make it his aim, not to
inform men of the lowest degree of virtue that
they may take up with, but to animate them to
what is sublime and noble in goodness. He
should not attempt to determine with a frivolous
accuracy, but endeavour to excite commanding
emotions, and to infuse a strong spirit of virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="163"/>
But, as the world goes, a minister cannot expect
to be often consulted by his parishioners, how they
ought to act in particular cases which are yet
before them. Men are not very ready even to
examine their own conduct before they act, much
less to consult another about it. It is at that time
of greatest importance, that we should have just
views of our actions; but passion seldom allows
us then to consider what we are doing, candidly
and impartially. It is when the action is over,
when the passions which prompted to it have sub∣sided,
that men begin candidly to consider their
conduct. Then they often reflect on their viola∣tion
of the laws of virtue, with remorse, dread,
and terror: and sometimes the consciousness of
having done wrong is such a load upon their minds,
that they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ager to disburden themselves to their
minister, and to know his opinion concerning that
conduct which fills them with severe compunction.
In this case a minister ought to represent their past
conduct to them in its true light, without either
exaggerating or extenuating it. The former
would only either irritate them to defend it, or
fink them into despair; and the latter would favour
the partial views of it, which they are too apt to
entertain of their own accord. It should be his
chief business to prevent their consciousness of
guilt from producing vain regret, and to instil
such principles and resolutions as may secure them
from the like errors for the future. When they
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
feel keen remorse for some heinous sin which they
have committed, it must be cherished by the
minister till it produce thorough repentance pro∣portioned
to the crime, and so directed that it may
most effectually produce this. If their remorse be
in danger of degenerating into despair, it is his
business, without disguising the real heinousness of
their sin, to inculcate the assurance which, not∣withstanding
that, they have of pardon on their
amendment.</P>
<P>The second kind of cases of conscience are those
which regard the general state of men's souls. It
is natural that men should be solicitous to obtain
some degree of certainty, whether they be in a
state of grace and reconciliation with God or not.
But it is not always easy, either for themselves or
others, to determine this. Though some men
may, on account of the great uniformity of their
holiness, obtain a considerable degree of <HI>assurance,</HI>
yet most men, by reason of the inconstancy of
their good conduct, of the frequent repetition of
sins which they have resolved to forsake, and of
other causes, can entertain only different degrees of
<HI>hope,</HI> and ought not to be encouraged to more.
There are several circumstances which increase
the difficulty of dealing with persons who propose
cases of this kind. We shall mention a few of
these, and make some general observations on the
subject.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="165"/>
The doubts of men concerning their state are
generally very much heightened by a system of
principles, exaggerated beyond the truth, with
which they are all connected, and on which they
depend. Some of the most considerable of them
are these. They carry the doctrine of original sin
so far, as to imagine that all men are, for many
years of their lives, in a state of damnation, and
wholly destitute of all grace; they think that this
state continues, till they be at a certain period in
a sensible manner converted; by straining some
scripture metaphors, they represent conversion to
themselves as attended with violent inward pang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and terrors of considerable duration; they judge of
the sincerity of their conversion and regeneration
by the violence of these, more than by the general
tenor of their temper and conduct; when these
wear off, they are either filled with joy in the con∣fidence
of their being already regenerated, or else
plunged in doubts whether they do not still con∣tinue
in a state of nature. It is necessary that a
minister know perfectly the set of principles with
which a person's doubts are connected, before he
can argue with him; and that he do not attempt
directly to call them in question, even though he
should not be satisfied of their truth, but rather
reason upon them as much as he can. His chief
business should be, insensibly to correct the extravagancies
of these principles, to direct men not to
judge by their inward pangs and sorrows, which
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
are fallacious marks; to turn their attention to
their habitual conduct and temper, as the only
sure criterion. When he finds that their per∣plexity
arises from their wanting to find in them∣selves
some mysterious marks of grace, it should be
his business to inculcate on them, that christian and
moral virtues are both the only genuine fruits, and
the only infallible marks of grace. By bringing
men to estimate their state by this criterion, he will
render the trial much less liable to ambiguity. It
is likewise of importance that a minister, in cases
of this kind, endeavour to give men right notions
of conversion; for from wrong conceptions of it,
many of their perplexities arise. In consequence of
their exaggerations of the set of principles before∣mentioned,
they consider regeneration as if it were
a line, on the one side of which lies a state of
damnation, but crossing it in a moment as it were,
they are immediately in a state of grace and salva∣tion,
from which they can never fall. Regene∣ration
must therefore be represented to them as a
work that is not accomplished all at once, but
carried on by slow degrees; so that it may be
begun where it is yet very imperfect, and must be
completed by strenuous diligence and the uniform
practice of holiness. It must be urged, that they
can never be sure of their conversion, till it has
produced this effect; but that every degree of this
effect is a sufficient ground of hope that it is begun.
It is only by such a representation of things, that
they can be guarded, on the one hand, against
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
despair, from thinking themselves wholly in a
state of nature; or, on the other hand, against
security or presumption, from imagining that they
are all at once translated into that state of grace,
from which they are in no danger of apostatizing.
It would be endless to mention all the difficulties
which arise from the perversion of different prin∣ciples
of religion, or all the varieties which, from
this perversion, occur in the cases which will be
proposed to ministers. Prudence and reflection,
joined with experience, will be the best help for
these.</P>
<P>It was already hinted, that one will not receive
a great deal of assistance from the writings of
casuists, for the discharge of this duty. But still
he may receive some. He will however receive
greatly more from a thorough knowlege of the
scriptures, from a distinct comprehension of the
terms of the gospel covenant, from an extensive
view and a strong sense of the measures of conduct
and the propriety of behaviour.</P>
<P>But we must mention one circumstance, which
greatly increases the difficulty of this part of a
minister's business. It is this, that doubts or fears
are often joined with bodily distemper, with melan∣choly.
When this is the case, a doubt about the
nature of one action, sometimes comes to coincide
with a doubt about one's general state, as in the
instance which is very common among melancholy
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
persons; their suspecting that they have been
guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, and
therefore incapable of forgiveness. When persons
are subject to a melancholy habit, it is not easy to
talk to them in any way that will have any good
effect. I have been sometimes disposed to suspect,
that it would be best not to talk with them on
religious subjects at all: for their distemper makes
them misunderstand every thing that is said, and
wrest even what is most comfortable to a sense
unfavourable to themselves. Imagination is so
strong in that disease, that they will be often fully
convinced that a man has said just the reverse of
what he has said, and that the most harmless things
were intended as a plain hint to them that they are
in a hopeless state. There is nothing from which
they will not take a handle to feed their distemper,
and support their apprehensions. By this means, a
minister may increase their disorder, while he is
most desirous to allay it. But, on the whole, I am
inclined to the contrary opinion, that a minister
may, not often indeed, but when either the dis∣ordered
persons, or even those about them, express
a solicitude for it, converse with them with some
benefit. From his declining it, they might take
occasion to draw conclusions more to their own
disadvantage, than they could draw from any
thing he would say; as, that he thought them
unworthy of instruction or advice, that he knew
their state to be hopeless, or the like. Though
they will very probably wrest all that he says into
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
a sense unfavourable to themselves, still this is no
worse than would happen, though he abstained
from conversing with them; for the same turn of
imagination will lead them to run into similar
conclusions from their own thoughts, or from
the most indifferent conversation. As there is
always some mistaken notion or another which
breeds them uneasiness, a minister should endea∣vour
to rectify it. This will very probably have
little or no influence on them at the time; but it
may give them a handle for rectifying their own
notions, when their disease begins to wear off.
The talking with them on this subject may seem
to have a tendency to feed their distemper; but
there is really a necessity for humouring it in some
degree; and the ease which they receive from
giving it some vent at times, contributes more to
wear it off, than keeping it always under restraint.
At the same time, a minister ought to endeavour
to draw them off insensibly from those subjects
which distress and terrify them, to others more
indifferent. It will not be easy to do this; for
a melancholy imagination has a great degree of
obstinacy in adhering to the subjects which give
it uneasiness, and even persists in believing things
that never had an existence, and in persuading
a person that he has been guilty of crimes which
he never once thought of. It may, however, be
in some degree effected, by showing great sym∣pathy
with them, by humouring their caprices a
little, and by other prudent methods. But when
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
persons are in this disorder, which arises chiefly
from the body, it is above all of importance, that
they be kept from being much alone, that they be
diverted from thinking, and that they be prevailed
upon to take moderate exercise. A minister may
be of use to them, by directing those about them
to put them upon these: and by his authority with
them from his character, and the influence which
he may gain over them by insinuating conversation,
a minister may often be more successful in persuad∣ing
them to use these means of restoring their
health, than others could be.</P>
<P>To be often thus employed in directing the
conduct of others in difficult emergencies, in
teaching them what judgment they ought to form
of their past behaviour and their state, in distin∣guishing
needless scruples from conscientious care,
in stripping off false disguises from what is really
evil, has a plain tendency to dispose a minister
himself to act with a constant regard to the rules
of duty, to live correctly, and frequently to
review and examine his own temper and actions.</P>

<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of visiting the Afflicted.</HEAD>
<P>THE consideration of that one kind of distemper
just mentioned, naturally leads us to another duty
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
of the pastoral care, Visiting the afflicted, par∣ticularly
the sick. Nature itself prompts all men
so strongly to this, as might of itself convince us
that it is peculiarly the duty of a minister. But
the scripture likewise expressly makes it a part of
his duty, and directs Christians to call for him in
this situation. “Is any sick among you?” says
the apostle James, “let him call for the elders of
the church, and let them pray over him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">James, v. 14.</NOTE>.”
It is a duty of common humanity to sympathize
with persons in distress, and to give them all the
relief which our presence and the expression of our
sympathy can give; a minister may likewise give
them still more important relief by his instructions
and advices. Not only sickness, but every kind of
affliction, temporal losses, or the death of relations,
is an occasion which merits the presence and assist∣ance
of a minister. Adversity of every kind
demands both sympathy and consolation; and to
“weep with those who weep,” and to comfort
them if possible, is a noble employment. Pro∣sperity
has a natural tendency to produce thought∣lessness
and an unfeeling temper of mind, which
render men indisposed for receiving good impres∣sions.
Adversity tends to correct this stubborn∣ness,
to render the heart soft and pliable, to dispose
it to serious and useful reflections, and to fit it for
receiving a deep impression from religious instruc∣tions
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
and exhortations. A minister should there∣fore
regard the time of adversity as a favourable
opportunity, which he should not sail to seize, of
doing some good to those on whom all he could
say formerly had very little influence. He may
employ this opportunity in giving them any useful
instructions, relating to the whole of their christian
duty; for they will then be more inclined to listen
to them, and to be suitably affected with them, than
at other times. But it is more peculiarly proper
to show that all afflictions are appointed by the
powerful, wise, and good providence of God, and
that none of them can possibly befal any man
without his permission; to explain the wise ends
for which they are appointed, and the useful pur∣poses
to which men may render them subservient
to themselves. These are trite topics; it is taken
for granted that all men are acquainted with them,
and all imagine that they believe them. But it is
plain that they do not produce those effects upon
the temper of men, which they are naturally fitted
to produce; and therefore a minister should incul∣cate
them in such a way as is fittest to make them
touch the heart. Adversity of every kind contains
temptations to some particular vices; a minister
should make it a great part of his business, in con∣versing
with the afflicted, to guard them against
these vices, against discontent, repining, impa∣tience,
peevishness. Adversity demands some
duties in a peculiar manner, and either disposes to,
or gives opportunity for, the exertion of several
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
virtues; it is the natural season of consideration,
seriousness, prayer, self-examination, patience,
resignation. To these a minister should particu∣larly
exhort and excite those afflicted persons whom
he visits. It must however be remarked, that
though it is the duty of a minister to inculcate
these things as much as possible, yet great prudence
is often necessary in the manner of introducing
them. When an affliction is of such a nature as
to occasion violent sorrow or great disquiet of
mind, this must be in some degree abated, before
men are capable of listening to any thing. The
weakness of nature seems to require some vent for
the first transports of violent passions; but its
demand is much increased by this circumstance,
that the generality of men never think of restraining
any passion, but accustom themselves to indulge
the present impulse or inclination, especially when
it is strong and vehement. On this account, when
a minister has frequent and ready access to afflicted
persons, it will often be best at first to allow them
to give scope to their uneasiness, only gently check∣ing
such expressions of it as are quite extravagant,
highly indecent, or plainly sinful; and afterwards,
as they become more composed, to insinuate gradu∣ally
useful instructions and religious reflections,
which may both contribute to compose them more,
and, by taking fast hold of their minds in their
present pliable temper, remain with them, and
actuate their future conduct. But he must still
take care, before that softness and docility of mind
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
which springs from affliction be worn off, or con∣siderably
abated, to propose to them, in the
strongest manner, all the instructions which he
thinks they stand in need of, and will now receive
with greater advantage than at another time. If a
minister will perform this part of his duty, he must
generally do it without being asked; for it is not
entirely customary to send for a minister on such
occasions: but, by going of his own accord, he
may furnish his people with useful materials for
meditation in the time of their distress, which may
likewise exert themselves in directing their whole
future conduct.</P>
<P>Almost the only species of distress in which
the generality think of desiring the presence or
advice of their minister, is sickness; and then too,
they are often very late of desiring it. They some∣times
defer it till they have lost all hopes of reco∣very,
and then send for him, either to fit them for
heaven, as it were, by a charm, or to see if he can
allay the terrors which have seized upon them in
the prospect of death. It is, at any rate, a difficult
work to deal with those who are just stepping into
eternity; but when this circumstance attends it, it
renders it much more difficult. In order to pre∣vent
it, a minister should not stay till he be sent
for; but as soon as he hears that any in his parish
are sick, he should immediately go to them of his
own accord. By this means, he will have an
opportunity of examining and exhorting them,
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
while they are yet capable of some composure of
thought, and have some time before them; and
he will contribute to wear out an opinion which
seems to be too prevalent, that they need only a
prayer from a minister in their last moments. By
this means too, he will most effectually consult his
own ease; for by visiting the sick when he can
render it convenient for him, he will in some mea∣sure
prevent his being sent for when it is less con∣venient.</P>
<P>In other churches, there is a particular office
for this duty prescribed by authority; but even
this does not exhaust the duty. “To run over
some prayers, and to take leave,” is easy, but
comes not up to the design of these churches in
prescribing it; and the form itself supposes parti∣cular
and suitable addresses by the minister himself.
In all these addresses he should apply himself parti∣cularly
to the state and condition of the person
whom he visits.</P>
<P>In every thing that a minister says to a sick per∣son,
he ought to keep three things steadily in view;
the influence which it may have on the person, if
dying; the influence which it may have on him,
if he should recover; and the influence which it
may have upon persons in health, who are about
him. Every thing that can have a bad influence
in any of these ways, must be carefully avoided.
A minister must guard the person himself against
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
ill-grounded hopes of mercy on the one hand, and
against despair on the other; he must avoid giving
him any notions that could tempt him to careless∣ness
and security, if he should recover, or encou∣rage
him to trust again to a death-bed repentance;
and he must be anxiously on his guard against
dropping any thing that can lead spectators in the
least to flatter themselves, that after having spent
their life in sin, they may set all to rights by a few
tears, or confessions, or prayers, in their last hours.
Any man will very often find it difficult to guard
his thoughts and expressions so as to avoid all
these hazards; and therefore every one should
employ the most intense and deliberate meditation
about it.</P>
<P>There are many subjects on which a minister
may properly insist in all his exhortations to sick
or dying persons. He should inculcate on them,
that diseases are ordered, not by chance, but by
Divine Providence, either for punishment, for
correction, or for our exercise in virtue; and in
consequence of this, encourage them to patience,
persuade them to resignation, exhort them to
examine their conduct, and to resolve to amend
what has been faulty in it. He should instruct
them in the nature of death, and instill into them
those sentiments of the vanity of present things, of
the folly of anxiety about them, of immoderate love
to them, of endless endeavours or unlawful
methods to procure them, of abusing them to bad
<PB N="170" REF="177"/>
purposes, of sinking ourselves in sensual pleasures,
which obviously arise from the consideration of the
nature of death, and which, if he can thoroughly
instill them, will enable them either to leave these
things without regret if they should happen to
die, or to live above them if they should recover.
He should lead their view to the important conse∣quences
of death, as it is our entrance into an
eternal world; that when they have now a near
prospect of it, they may be more sensibly struck
with the solemnity of judgment, with the glories
of heaven, and with the terrors of hell, and feel
all their power. He should instruct them in that
preparation which it will appear, from the view of
its nature, that death requires; an habitual supe∣riority
to things external, disengagement from the
body and from sensual pleasures, and such a con∣duct
as naturally springs from a firm faith in the
unseen world. He should also explain to them
fully, and illustrate with sorce, the nature of the
gospel covenant; the blessings which God on his
part proposes to us, both those which he has
bestowed on us in this life as privileges which we
ought to improve, and by which we ought to be
excited to the practice of every christian virtue,
and those which he promises in the future world
as the reward of christian obedience, and the im∣provement
of grace already received; and like∣wise
the terms which God requires from us on our
part. As it is of the greatest consequence to pre∣serve
a full view of these through the whole of life,
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>
so it is of particular importance that persons have
a full and lively sense of them in the prospect of
death, as they alone can direct their judgment
concerning themselves, and be a foundation either
of such hopes as may comfort and encourage them,
or of such fears as may rouse them to do all that is
yet possible for their souls. If sick persons dis∣cover
any thing which perplexes their minds, or
any cases in which they want to be resolved, a
minister ought to give them his counsel and assist∣ance
honestly; but he ought to avoid giving a
positive determination about the final state of their
souls: as he cannot know the heart, he should
content himself with calling upon them to finish
their duty, to do all the good they can in the time
that remains, and to pray for pardon and accept∣ance,
and with explaining the terms of salvation,
so as to give them the principles on which they
themselves may, from a careful and conscientious
review of their temper and conduct, be enabled
to judge concerning themselves; but he has
nothing to do to meddle with passing a final
sentence.</P>
<P>Sometimes a minister is called to visit a sick
person, of whom he knows very little, and of
whose character and conversation he can obtain no
information beforehand. In this case, all he can
do is, “to lay before him what he ought to be,
and remind him to consult his conscience what
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
he has been;” to represent, in a plain and
striking manner, the general considerations which
have been already mentioned, and particularly the
terms of the gospel covenant; to urge him to
apply these things to himself, according as his
conscience witnesses concerning the state of his
soul; and to exhort him to examine himself, to
begin or perfect his repentance, to confess his
sins, resolve against indulging them hereafter, and
implore forgiveness; to be reconciled to his neigh∣bours,
and forgive his enemies, to make restitution
to any whom he has wronged, to do all the acts of
piety and virtue for which he finds opportunity,
and above all, to take care not to sin towards the
end of life; for if repentance on a death-bed be
very late for the sins of life, what time is left to
repent of sins committed on a death-bed? Some∣times
a minister, who knew nothing of a person
before he went to visit him, will, by conversing
with him, perceive some openings into his cha∣racter,
and, by pursuing these, may draw out of
him a more thorough knowlege of his temper;
and to this he should accommodate both his instruc∣tions
and exhortations. But as this may not
always happen, and as every one has not the
readiness that is necessary for suiting himself to
what he discovers concerning a man's character
immediately and wholly off hand, a minister
should do every thing he can to obtain inform∣ation
concerning the character and conduct of
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
persons, before he go to them in their sickness,
that he may be able to apply himself suitably to
them.</P>
<P>Sometimes a minister meets with sick persons
the whole tenor of whose life gives him ground to
believe that they are truly good. Some of these
reap in their last hours the fruits of a well-spent
life; he finds them rejoicing in the approbation of
a good conscience, and in the hope of heaven. In
this case, when there is reason to judge that their
joy and hope are well founded, a minister has little
to do but to rejoice with them, and to encourage
them to thankfulness, and to that great act of
faith and trust which must be exerted in resigning
the soul to its faithful Creator, as its guide into an
unknown state. It will not however be improper,
even in this case, to exhort them to examine them∣selves
over and over again, that they may be ren∣dered
still more certain of their state; to repent still
again particularly of all the sins which they can
recollect; to pray for the pardon of their daily
infirmities, and of the secret faults which they
cannot recollect; and to fill up the remainder of
their lives with all the acts of virtue which they
can crowd into it. But even of good persons a
minister will find some who are full of uneasiness
and fears. He should examine into the grounds of
their fears. If he find that they do not proceed
from the consciousness of any habitual sins, or of
inconstancy in religious practice, but only from a
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
strong sense of the importance of the change of
state at death, and of the possibility of their being
mistaken in their judgment of themselves (and this
alone will often occasion great uneasiness and
discomposure in persons of timorous constitutions);
then he ought to set himself particularly to strengthen
their faith, and encourage their resignation, by
representing to them the goodness, compassion, and
mercy of the divine nature, the display of it
already made in the gospel dispensation, the tender
care of God's providence, which they have expe∣rienced
through life, the promises which he has
made to his sincere servants of pardon and salva∣tion,
the security for the performance of these
which arises both from the veracity of God, and
from the blessings being already purchased by
Christ. In this manner he should raise them to
hope, and endeavour to calm and compose them
for the great change which they are soon to under∣go.
At the same time, it is proper to give them
those exhortations which we have already hinted at
with regard to other good men. All good men
should be exhorted in sickness, to apply particu∣larly
to such exercises as are peculiarly fit to pre∣pare
them for death. Indeed, a good life is the
only preparation for death. But though it is by
far too late to begin our preparation for death when
sickness is come on, and though such preparation
can scarcely answer any good purpose; yet even
they who have lived best will not find it unnecessary
to apply more particularly to prepare for death,
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
when it seems to be approaching. They should
therefore be exhorted to draw off their thoughts
and affections from present things, to converse
with themselves more intensely and uninterruptedly
than they had done before, that they may get
possession of themselves, that they may become
more acquainted and intimate with themselves,
that they may see whether there be any sin which
they have not yet thoroughly reformed, any injury
which they have not repaired, any quarrel which
they have not made up, any part of their duty in
which they have been negligent, any virtue which
they find weak; and that they may set about
putting all these things more perfectly to rights.
They should be exhorted to spend a great part of
their time in acts of devotion, in prayer, in medi∣tation,
in praise, that they may thus be raised above
the world, and formed to the temper and employ∣ment
of heaven.</P>
<P>But the work of a minister is both most dis∣agreeable
and most difficult when he finds those
upon a sick bed whose past conduct and temper
make it extremely probable, or next to certain, that
they are vicious and wicked, that they have the
work of their salvation yet to begin. There is
scarcely any ground to hope for their perfecting
their repentance, or securing their salvation; and
yet it would be a melancholy work for a minister
barely to tell them this and leave them; and it
might render them desperate, and make them,
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
through despair, die obstinate in their sins. “If
he find them so ignorant as not to know what
faith and repentance mean; if they have led so
careless lives in this world, as scarce ever to
have had a serious thought of another; what is
to be done? can he do nothing but pray by
them, and so dismiss them into their eternal
state? It is certainly a very unpromising
attempt, to teach men how to begin to live,
when they are ready to die, or to make them
sensible of their sins in the moment of death,
when they never before bestowed a thought upon
them; yet a minister should do what he can, by
his warm and serious discourse, to inform and
awaken the consciences even of such<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, vol. i. p. 54, &amp;c.</NOTE>.” He
will find some great sinners insensible and uncon∣cerned
even in the views of death. They will
only acknowlege that they are sinners, as well as
all other men, but they trust to the mercies of God
and the merits of Christ. To such he must repre∣sent
the terrors of the wrath to come, and impress
them with lively apprehensions of it. In order to
make them sensible that they are in danger of it,
he must endeavour to make them sensible of their
particular sins, by leading them to discover them
themselves, and by charging them with such as he
knows they have been guilty of; and he must
expose the false grounds of hope on which they
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
build their confidence, and show them the in∣dispensable
necessity of repentance and holiness.
But if he should even succeed in awakening the
consciences of habitual sinners, or if he should
find such sinners, as he sometimes will, seized
with terror in the prospect of death, and the mi∣nister
called to give them comfort, what can he
then do? He sees confusion in their faces, and
can discern the violent throes of a guilty con∣science,
and the torturing fears of a sad hereafter;
he knows that all their terrors are too just, and
that it is scarcely possible that they can now sin∣cerely
repent. But with what reluctance must he
speak the severe truths which yet are fit for them
to hear? Shall he, therefore, immediately apply
to them all the promises of the gospel, merely be∣cause
they are alarmed at the near approach of
death and judgment? Whatever pain it give him∣self,
he must beware of speaking peace too hastily
to their souls. He should endeavour to prevent
absolute despair, but he must do no more to com∣fort
them; for the more they hope, it may for the
most part be justly said, the worse they are. With
regard to all wicked persons, it is the business of
a minister, to press them to repent upon a sick
bed as the best thing they can do, though the suc∣cess
of it be far from certain; to point out the acts
of repentance of which they are still capable, and
put them upon performing them; to exhort them
to sorrow for their sins, to confess them to God,
to resolve against continuing in them if they should
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
recover; to pray earnestly for mercy and for true
repentance; to neglect no act of virtue for which
they have opportunity; in a word, to do all that
they can in the short time that yet remains. He
should inform them, that if their salvation be yet
possible, it can be only in this way.</P>
<P>Sometimes a sickness is of so long duration, that
persons have time, during the course of it, to give
strong marks of their repentance, patience, and
piety. These may be encouraged to some degree
of humble hope, though not without a mixture of
fear. But in every other case, a minister ought
not to give a person who has lived a wicked life,
any positive ground of hope, on account of the
forced and imperfect repentance which takes its
rise only on a sick bed from the fears of hell. No∣thing
can have more pernicious consequences; it
makes the persons themselves, if they die, perish
in security; it encourages them, if they recover,
to return to their sins, in hopes of receiving as
quick and easy an absolution when they come
again to be laid on a sick bed; and it leads all who
witness it, to what they are too prone to of them∣selves,
to put off religion to the last, when they
see that all may be made up so easily by a few sighs
or tears in the concluding hours of life, when they
are not fit for sinning. All the promises of the
gospel-covenant are made only to them who lead a
holy life; and since these promises are the only
foundation of our faith and hope in Christ, we
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
cannot give encouragement beyond them to those
who have lived a wicked life, and only begin to re∣pent
of it in the hour of death. A minister, there∣fore,
can warrantably only do some of the follow∣ing
things. He may urge a sinner to all the re∣pentance
that he can perform, as the only possible,
though now a very uncertain remedy, and to re∣sign
the event to the mercies of God in Christ
Jesus, since he has not ground for trust or confi∣dence.
Or, he may represent to him the terms of
the gospel-covenant, and leave the application to
himself; but tell him withal, that the application
must be difficult and uncertain. Or, he may tell
him, that his repentance will be accepted if it be
sincere and genuine; but inform him at the same
time, that whether it be, in his circumstances,
sincere or not, neither the minister, nor the person
himself, but God alone, can certainly know. How
can it be ascertained that a person is sincere in his
repentance, who is out of a capacity of giving
proof of its sincerity by amendment of life? How
can it be ascertained either to himself or others,
without its being at all tried? And how can it be
tried, when he is just going out of the state of
trial? When we reflect how small a proportion
of those who make a show of repentance on a sick
bed, and afterwards recover, live like penitents,
and lead truly holy lives, we may be convinced
that a death-bed repentance gives no ground for
higher hopes than we have represented. But
though a minister can give so little comfort, and
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
though it be so extremely doubtful whether all the
repentance to which he can bring wicked men
upon a sick bed will be available to their salvation,
yet his visits to such are not altogether useless. If
they should recover, the sense of the dangerous
state in which they were, and the sentiments which
have been rendered familiar to them during their
sickness, may, perhaps, be the beginnings of a
new life, and the principles of a thorough amend∣ment.
In order to promote this the more, a mi∣nister
should urge the sick persons whom he visits,
to make solemn vows of amending the vices to
which they have been formerly addicted, of prac∣tising
the duties which they have hitherto neglected;
and he should exact particular promises on these
heads. Whenever they recover, he should put
them in mind of these, oblige them to renew them,
recommend it to them to repeat them often. If
he observe them transgressing them in any instance,
he should reprove them for it. If they appear to
throw off all regard to them, as is too often the
case, then he may safely assure them, that if they
had died in their sickness, as their repentance was
not sincere, they must infallibly have perished;
and he ought to warn them beforehand, that if
they persist in a course of vice till they again fall
upon a sick bed, all the strongest show of repent∣ance
and seriousness which they can then put on,
will be of no advantage to their salvation. Such
awful denunciations may, perhaps, awaken them;
but though they should not, the minister has done
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
his duty by making them, and their guilt rests
upon their own heads.</P>
<P>There is a middle class of persons, the incon∣stant
and wavering. With these, also, it is not
easy to know how to deal, in sickness and the
prospect of death. It is not easy to judge, whether
all the infirmities which have attended them, be
consistent with sincerity on the whole; whether
their frequent relapses after repentance be con∣sistent
with the truth of that repentance; whether
their sins be consistent with a state of grace and the
hope of heaven; whether they are failings, or were
committed in opposition to such a measure of con∣viction
and power of resistance as makes them
wilful and presumptuous<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccl. Cases, vol. i, p. 57.</NOTE>? All that a minister
can do in this case, is to represent the real doctrine
of scripture concerning universal and stedfast obe∣dience,
and to enforce the deep repentance con∣fessedly
requisite, in such a manner as neither on
the one hand to discourage hope, nor on the other
to encourage confidence.</P>
<P>It is customary, not only to admonish sick per∣sons,
but also to pray with them; and it is indeed
proper, though the prayers of a minister be often
regarded too much in a superstitious light. Any
of the proper materials of devotion are, no doubt,
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
proper materials of prayer on such occasions; but
some subjects of devotion have a peculiar propriety;
as expressions of the holiness and the mercy of
God; of his perfection, and superiority to all evil;
of his eternal and immutable happiness; of his
universal authority and providence, by which he
disposes all things, and without which nothing can
befall us, nor a hair of our heads fall to the
ground; of our dependence upon him, and of the
frailty of our nature; of his tender care, pity, and
indulgence to good men; of the merciful ends for
which he afflicts, and the good fruits which we
may derive from afflictions, by bearing and im∣proving
them aright; expressions of gratitude to
God for the mercies which he continually bestows,
even in the midst of adversity, but especially for
the mediation of Christ and the gospel covenant,
which is the only foundation of hope to fallen
creatures; for the glorious blessings that are pro∣mised
in it; and for the reasonable and easy terms
which are required; joined with expressions of our
full persuasion, that we can be accepted only on
these terms, and that neither the mercies of God,
nor the purchase of Christ, will be extended to any
who remain unpenitent in sin; petitions for a deep
sense of our obligations as Christians; for patience
to bear afflictions; for grace to make a proper use
of them; for the pardon of sin according to the
gospel terms; for the recovery of the sick person;
for bringing him to repentance, or for perfecting
his sanctification; for mercy to his soul if he die,
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
for the peculiar care of God in the moment of
death, and in conducting him into the unseen
world; for grace to lead all to a sense of the cer∣tainty
and importance of death, and to a constant
preparation for it. These and other similar senti∣ments,
which will naturally occur, have plainly a
particular propriety in prayers for sick persons.</P>
<P>It has been already remarked, that in all admo∣nitions
to sick persons, a regard should be had to
spectators. And it is often one of the most useful
purposes of visiting sick persons, to give those that
are about them such admonitions as naturally arise
from the occasion. They may very probably have
a peculiar degree of force, when they are preached
from a sick bed as a text. It will be very proper
to impress them with a sense of their mortality, of
the uncertainty of life, and to press them to a
speedy and timeous preparation for death. The
particular situation of the sick person will suggest
particular considerations which may be proposed
to them. A good man, composed and joyful in
the view of death, may be represented to them
as a living and striking example of the blessedness
of religion and goodness. From seeing a good
man in some degree of fear, they may be warned,
how much juster ground of fear they have, whose
consciences tell them that they have led worse lives.
The agonies of a dying sinner supply a strong pic∣ture
of the misery of vice, which may alarm the
most insensible. The vain hopes of a wicked man
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
give a proper handle to represent the obduracy
which springs from continnance in sin, depriving
men of all sense both of guilt and of danger. Every
other peculiarity in the situation of a sick person
will, in like manner, suggest some suitable ex∣hortation
to spectators. In every case, it is proper
for a minister to comfort the relations, and to in∣culcate
on them resignation.</P>
<P>This duty of the pastoral office is both important
and of a very delicate nature. We have, there∣fore,
been the more particular in explaining it.
But, after all, there will so many minute varieties
arise in particular cases, that, notwithstanding all
the directions that can be given, there will remain
great need for prudence and attention. Not only
the usefulness of these labours to others should re∣commend
them to the careful practice of a mi∣nister,
but likewise the influence which the right
performance of them will have on the improve∣ment
of his own heart. Nothing can have a
stronger tendency to excite men to all holiness,
than the frequent occasions which ministers have
of going into the house of mourning, and con∣versing
with the sick. They are a continual pre∣servative
against the infection and corruptions of
prosperity. To see virtue supporting those who
have been steady in the practice of it, in their latest
moments, under the agonies of pain, and enabling
them to triumph in the prospect of death, is na∣turally
a strong incitement to virtue. To see a
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
small degree of conscious vice disquieting a good
man, must excite a minister to the greatest vigi∣lance.
To see the horrors of vice taking fast hold
on the sturdiest sinners, can scarcely fail of deter∣ring
him from sin. Opportunities of this kind
returning so often to a minister, that the impression
made by one instance can scarce decay, till it be
revived and strengthened by another, must form
him to virtue, if he be not destitute of all prin∣ciples
of reformation. And every minister should
be careful to execute these duties in such a manner
as not to lose the advantages which they afford for
his own improvement.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Reproving.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER duty of the pastoral office is to re∣prove
and rebuke such as are faulty in their moral
conduct. This is always disagreeable to a man of
modesty and goodness; but reproofs and rebukes
are often necessary and useful for reforming sinners;
and whenever they are so, the scripture makes it
the indispensable duty of a minister to tender them.
Thus the apostle commands Timothy to “reprove
and rebuke with all long-suffering and doctrine<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>,”
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
to expose to wicked persons the baseness of their
conduct, and admonish them to amend. And he
commands Titus to “rebuke sharply<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tit. i. 13.</NOTE>” certain
unruly persons, and in general to “rebuke,”
as well as to “speak and exhort with all autho∣rity<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 15.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>To rebuke in such a manner as may give a
probability of its answering a good end, will gene∣rally
require a considerable degree of prudence
and address, and will always require care to suit it
both to the nature of the offence, and to the cir∣cumstances
in which the rebuke is given.</P>
<P>Sometimes things worthy of rebuke are done
by persons in the presence of a minister. Oaths
and imprecations are sometimes uttered; senti∣ments
are expressed and avowed, that tend to pol∣lute
the imaginations, or corrupt the hearts of men;
and sometimes even topics are enlarged upon,
which are irreligious, immoral, or indecent. It
is always necessary for a minister, in this case,
to show his disapprobation; but great prudence
is necessary in choosing the proper way of show∣ing
it.</P>
<P>There are some cases of this kind, in which a
grave rebuke, and serious arguments, to show the
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
badness of the conduct, will be both proper and
effectual. When the offenders are of the lower
sort, so that they and all others must acknowlege
the minister's superiority to them; or when they
are not hardened in vice, but appear to have run
into the indecency more through inadvertence than
bad disposition, this method of disapprobation is
generally proper. A man of prudence will, from
his knowlege of the circumstances of each parti∣cular
case, judge when it is proper to apply it,
that is, when it is likely to do good. But it is
plain that there are many cases, in which this
method would do harm instead of good; and as
rebukes are useful only for the end they answer,
it can never be incumbent on a minister to use them
in these cases. Yet still, as a subordinate end of
them is to warn others, and prevent their being
infected, a minister should use some other method
of showing his dissatisfaction. Sometimes a hint
dropped with good humour, from which the per∣son
himself may easily infer the indecency of his
conduct, and the minister's sense of it, or a story
serving this purpose, will have a very good effect.
At the same time that it shows a man's sense of the
indecency of the conduct, it shows an unwilling∣ness
to find fault, and a tenderness and deserence
for the person, which cannot fail to touch those
who have any degree of ingenuity, though they
would have perhaps been irritated, and rendered
obstinate in defending themselves, by a plain
reproof. Sometimes a minister may plainly per∣ceive,
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
that even this would provoke the offender
to proceed to greater outrages. In that case he
may sometimes succeed, by turning the conver∣sation
to some more innocent and useful topic.
By this means, he will at least prevent the repeti∣tion
and continuance of the offence; and very
probably the offender may, if not immediately,
yet afterwards, perceive the meaning of the
transition, and be gained by the gentleness which
attended it. If a person be so obdurate, that none
of these methods can influence him, a minister may
sufficiently show his disapprobation of the indecency
to the rest of the company, by preserving silence of
an expressive kind. But if the indecency rise high,
and cannot be checked by any of these methods,
a minister should withdraw from the company, and
not give even the degree of seeming approbation,
which might perhaps be inferred merely from his
presence. There is another way which may some∣times
be tried with good success. If the indecency
be such, that a minister can at all bear to witness
it, he may seem to let it pass in the company
unobserved, and take the first opportunity which
occurs conveniently to mention it to the offender
in private. In this situation he will not be so
ready to grow obstinate in defending it; he will
be more easily convinced of its impropriety; he
will be apter to acknowlege the fault, and may
possibly afterwards himself inform the company of
the disapprobation he met with; at any rate,
the tenderness which is in this way shown to his
<PB N="189" REF="196"/>
reputation, must, if he have any degree either of
sense or goodness, prevent his being provoked by
the admonition.</P>
<P>It must be left wholly to a minister's own pru∣dence
to discover which of these methods of reproof
suits every particular case. But still it must be
remembered, that a minister ought in no case to
show the least appearance of approving any thing
that is indecent or immoral, or even an uncon∣cernedness
about it. A great degree of modesty
may tempt a minister to this; but it is a false and
excessive modesty: and however amiable this
quality is in itself, yet whenever it hinders a man
from doing his duty, or makes him ashamed of
adhering to strict virtue, it becomes a real vice.
A minister should set himself to conquer it, and to
obtain such a degree of assurance, as may both
enable him to do his duty when the interests of
virtue and religion are concerned, and to do it
with that ease and address which may render it
successful. If an excess of modesty cannot excuse
a minister from performing this part of his duty,
much less can a servile complaisance to rank and
fortune, which is vicious in itself. Indeed, a
neglect of this duty can never fail to bring upon a
minister suspicion of his being indifferent about
virtue, to diminish his authority and influence, to
expose him to contempt, and to bring the whole
order into disrepute. I shall only remark farther,
that as rebuking seems in its very nature to imply
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
a claim to superiority, the greatest care must be
used to take off, as much as possible, this appear∣ance,
by the manner of giving it, without the
most distant approach to passion, pertness, inso∣lence,
or assuming, with the strongest marks of
meekness and respect.</P>
<P>But it is not only offences committed in a
minister's company, that are the proper subjects of
rebuke. A minister must admonish his parish∣ioners,
for whatever faults he either learns from
others, or discovers by his own conversation with
them, to prevail in their temper or their conduct.
Heinous crimes require severe rebukes; and even
slighter deviations from virtue must be reproved,
that both the persons, themselves may be reclaimed
from them, and the contagion kept from seizing
others. But these two different sorts of faults
must not be treated in the same way. The apostle
Jude points out the distinction which should be
made between them: “of some have compassion,
and others save with fear, pulling them out of
the fire<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jude, xxii. 23.</NOTE>.” Gentler remedies must be applied
to the lesser irregularities of the soul. But the
deeper pollutions of the soul, like the more dan∣gerous
wounds of the body, must be searched and
probed, and have more painful remedies applied to
them. Again, all sorts of persons must be admo∣nished
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
and rebuked, when their conduct deserves
it, but not all in the same manner. The same
apostle Paul, who commands Timothy and Titus
so often to reprove, yet directs the former,
“rebuke [not an elder, but intreat him as a
father<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 1.</NOTE>.” This direction is applicable to all supe∣riors,
whether in age, education, rank, or for∣tune.
According to the natural sentiments of
mankind, all these qualities produce a kind of
superiority; and deference and respect is our duty
to all superiors; a duty the obligation of which
their faults cannot extinguish. When the offender
is plainly our inferior, we have a natural authority
which gives us a right to address him without much
ceremony. It is generally sufficient with such
to profess our concern for them, our sincere inten∣tion
of their good, and immediately to enter on the
part of their conduct that is blameable: their sense
of their inferiority will keep them from taking
offence at the freedom. It is generally necessary
to represent the fault to them fully and in strong
colours; for their want of improvement would
prevent their understanding your meaning, if you
should touch it more slightly, or endeavour to
point out its evil by hints. It is often likewise
proper to condemn it with strong expressions of
authority and displeasure, though always without
anger or passion; for the lower sorts of men have
<PB N="192" REF="199"/>
so little of delicate feeling, that without this they
will scarce think you in earnest. But it will easily
appear that this method of address would be often
improper to persons of superior quality or abilities.
It would scarcely be consistent with the deference
and respect due to them; and therefore, in reprov∣ing
their faults in this manner, a minister would
really transgress his own duty. Rebukes are not
enjoined for their own sake, but for the sake of the
good effects which they produce; and there is the
greatest probability of their being useful to supe∣riors,
by their being managed in another way. It
is often proper to wait or to seek for an occasion
which will naturally introduce a rebuke, that
you may not seem to be fond of finding fault. It
is often proper not to dwell long on the fault, but
to give a few hints of its baseness; for superior
parts always, and often even the improvement
which arises from the conversation of the higher
ranks, give a penetration and acuteness which
enable men to take a hint; and if they do, it will
have this advantage, that their conviction will
spring chiefly from their own reflections in pursu∣ing
it. It is generally proper to avoid an appear∣ance
of displeasure, because persons of better rank
will probably be offended with it; and therefore it
will defeat the end of the rebuke. And that can
never be justified by the dignity or authority of a
minister, which arises only from the good and
important end of his office. He never descends
from his dignity, nay he supports it most truly,
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
when he submits to the likeliest means of doing
good. It will be sometimes the best way, espe∣cially
with regard to lesser faults, to express a
general censure, or to give an oblique insinuation
against them, without directly charging them upon
the person. This will be sufficient with some dis∣cerning
and ingenuous persons; and whenever it
is sufficient, it is the most eligible, and will be the
most successful method. Sometimes also, a man's
vices may be reproved, by condemning the same
or similar ones in another person. The parable by
which Nathan reproved David, is an instance of
this. Many of our Saviour's parables too are re∣proofs
of his hearers. This method is always in∣offensive,
and will often be extremely convincing
and effectual. The guilty person will often feel
strong sentiments of disapprobation against his own
vices, when they are represented as belonging to
another; and, by showing him that his own con∣duct
is similar, these sentiments, when they are
already raised, may be easily transferred to himself,
and converted into remorse.</P>
<P>It has been already remarked, that the only end
of rebukes is amendment; therefore a minister
must not think that he has discharged his duty,
merely by telling a person his faults. He must
observe what effect the rebuke produces; if it pro∣duce
not amendment, he must repeat it; if it
produce this, he should encourage the person to
persist and to improve. Attention to the design
and use of reproof will likewise direct a minister
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
considerably in many circumstances relating to the
manner of rebuking. One should give cautions
oftener than rebukes; always, when they are
likely to answer the purpose. When a rebuke is
necessary, it should not be given harshly; with
concern, not with anger. Some persons might be
apt to find fault, merely to give vent to their own
spleen and ill-nature; and when reproof proceeds
from this principle, it can scarcely fail to be given
in a haughty, supercilious, or passionate manner.
Attention to its design will effectually check this;
for a suspicion of pique, or spleen, or humour is so
sure to render reproof ineffectual, that it is gene∣rally
eligible to let it alone altogether, when it is
likely, from particular circumstances, to give rise
to this suspicion. Every reproof ought, on the
contrary, to bear all the marks of tenderness,
meekness, and friendship, and even to be accom∣panied
with warm expressions of benevolence and
concern. It is generally best that rebukes be given
secretly and kept secret; for this will give them a
strong appearance of softness and meekness, will
show a tenderness to the person's reputation, and,
by this means, will gain upon him. A man dis∣likes
to be condemned in the presence of others,
and often thinks himself obliged in honour to at∣tempt
to justify himself, though he be really sen∣sible
of his faults. The disposition to this will be
prevented, or at least diminished, by the secrecy
of the rebuke. This spirit will, indeed, so far
prevail sometimes, that an offender will attempt to
excuse his fault even to a minister alone, when he
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
is notwithstanding sensible of it. On this account,
a minister cannot always conclude that his reproof
has been entirely useless, even when the person's
pride would not suffer him to acknowlege his fault;
for it may, notwithstanding, be remembered after∣wards,
and produce some effect upon him. It is
of importance to choose fit times for admonishing
and rebuking; for a person will often bear at one
time what he would not at another. A person
may be bettered by a rebuke given when he is easy
and in good humour, who would have been pro∣voked
by it, if it had been given when he was
perplexed or out of humour with something which
discomposed him. A person will listen to a re∣buke,
when, by any emergence, he is put into a
serious and thoughtful temper, who would have
paid no regard to it in an hour of gaiety and dissi∣pation.
Sometimes the approach of a communion
will give a minister a favourable opportunity of re∣proving
men for their vices, and of urging them
to forsake them, that he may not be obliged to
exclude them. Sometimes he may take occasion,
from their desiring to have their children baptized,
to admonish them of some faults, particularly of
such as look like a renouncing of their Christian
profession, and represent the necessity of amending
them, in order to their being reckoned Christians
themselves, or having their children intitled to
baptism. However delicate a matter it is to give
reproof, yet, if a minister have prudence, and
bestow the necessary reflection, he may almost
<PB N="196" REF="203"/>
always fall on some method so soft and inoffensive,
as even to affect the worst men, at least as not to
irritate and do harm. This is often the ill effect
of rebukes, indiscreetly managed. Some men,
whose zeal is greater than their prudence, think
themselves obliged to treat all in precisely the same
way, and imagine that any other conduct would
show a faulty respect of persons. Pride and conceit
are, sometimes, in this case mistaken for zeal.
But even when the conduct proceeds from real
zeal, it is from zeal ill-conducted, and defeating
itself. I therefore repeat, that reproof is only use∣ful
on account of its end, and therefore should be
always managed in the way that is fittest for pro∣ducing
reformation.</P>
<P>A minister ought to maintain an exact impar∣tiality
to all, and to show no respect to the great
and rich, more than to the meanest. But this
does not require that he should behave to them in
precisely the same way. On the contrary, to treat
them in the same way would be absolutely wrong.
It must be remembered, that the great and primary
end of rebuking men is always their reformation,
and that, of consequence, it is strictly the duty of
a minister to rebuke only in such a way, as is most
likely to answer this end. Now not only the dif∣ferent
tempers, but also the different educations,
ranks, and circumstances of men, render different
methods of reproof fittest to reform them, and
render a method of reproof, which will have great
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
force with one, absolutely unfit to work on another.
A minister who is careful to find out the proper
manner, and to apply it, not only is not guilty of
partiality, though it be very opposite to the kind
which he sometimes uses on similar occasions, but
really could not discharge his duty without it. A
minister should rebuke all ranks impartially and
without respect of persons; but he is impartial
only then, when he rebukes each in the way that
is likeliest to work on him, however different that
way be from what he finds it proper to use to an∣other;
and not to make this difference, would
really be a species of partiality, It is in vain to
say that a minister cannot exoner his conscience,
without using an uniform method of reproof with
all different ranks; for conscience requires, not
only that he should warn all, but likewise that he
should be careful to do it in the most effectual
way. But still, a minister is under a real and in∣dispensable
obligation to rebuke all offenders, as
long as there is any hope of them, in that way
which he judges will be most effectual with each.
There may be some, indeed, so very profligate,
that to reprove them will only make us the objects
of their scorn and hatred. When we are sure
that this is the case, our Saviour has excused us
from meddling with them, when he says, “Give
not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither
cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they tram∣ple
them under their feet, and turn again and
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
rend you<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 6.</NOTE>.” But a minister ought not hastily
and rashly to take it for granted, that men are thus
abandoned; indolence or indifference will often
plead this excuse, when there is no real ground
for it; but before men be thus given over as in∣corrigible,
a minister must have the strongest and
most satisfying and incontestable proofs of their
being really so; if he has not these, he is inex∣cuseable
for neglecting to watch all opportunities
to reprove them. When it is plain that they are
incorrigible, a minister should, as much as possible,
shun their company; whenever he does not think
himself obliged to this, he should reckon himself
obliged to rebuke them. It may be likewise pro∣per,
sometimes to warn others to beware of the
infection of their example; this may set them a
thinking, and produce their amendment.</P>
<P>It is a natural remark on this subject, that a
minister ought not to frequent the company of
any, whose conduct contains many things worthy
of rebuke. Not to rebuke them, will deservedly
destroy his authority; and if he rebuke them al∣ways
when there is occasion, he cannot continue
long fond of their company, nor they of his.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Convincing.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is another duty of the pastoral office
somewhat a-kin to reproving, I mean Convincing.
Rebuking regards the practice of men; Con∣vincing
regards their principles. Paul exhorts a
minister to “hold fast the faithful word, that he
may be able, by found doctrine, both to exhort
and to convince the gainsayers<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Tit. i. 9.</NOTE>.” To the
same purpose is what he writes to Timothy:
“The servant of the Lord must not strive, but be
gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in
meekness instructing those that oppose them∣selves,
if God peradventure will give them
repentance to the acknowleging of the truth<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. ii. 24, 25.</NOTE>.”
A minister may sometimes have occasion to con∣vince
those of our own communion, of particular
errors which they may have embraced; and some∣times
he will have occasion to confute and con∣vince
those who are not of our persuasion. We
need not consider these two separately; for they
are distinguished only by a greater or a less
degree of difference of opinion; and the means of
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
convincing both are the same; for a minister has
no dictatorial power over the former any more than
the latter; he is no lord over God's heritage,
nor has any right to dominion over the faith of
Christians. His whole power is ministerial; the
only instruments he must use for accomplishing any
of the ends of his office, are instruction, reasoning,
persuasion. A minister should take every fit oppor∣tunity
of endeavouring to convince those whom he
knows to entertain errors. The more dangerous
any error is, that is, the more immediately it
influences practice, the more earnest and assiduous
he should be in endeavouring to reclaim people
from it. In order to be able to attempt this, it is
necessary that a minister be thoroughly acquainted
with the subject in dispute, and with the principles
and spirit of those whom he endeavours to con∣vince.
In the present distracted state of Christ∣ianity,
there are many different sorts who are
involved in error, as infidels, papists, seceders,
methodists, quakers, &amp;c. some of which a minister
will most readily meet with in some situations, and
others in another. He ought to qualify himself
for dealing particularly with those who are to be
found in his parish. In endeavouring to convince
them, he should use only solid argument and calm
reasoning; for unfair arts in making proselytes are
perfectly unjustifiable; they may sometimes entrap
the weak, but if they are detected, they will only
confirm men in their own way, and expose the
person who used them to just abhorrence; and any
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
degree of heat and passion will look either as if a
man had an ill cause, or as if his desire to con∣vince
them arose only from his own humour and
desire of conquest. Before a minister can expect
to gain on those who differ from him, he must
show them that he loves them and wishes them
sincerely well, by using them with all kindness, by
doing them obliging offices, by betraying no dispo∣sition
to put them to any inconvenience on account
of their difference of sentiment, by rejoicing in the
toleration they enjoy, and the liberty they have of
professing their belief according to their con∣sciences;
in a word, by all the methods of charity,
meekness, and moderation. This will dispose them
to listen to his arguments. To give these their
full weight, he must first study to combat the
perverseness of their wills, their prejudices, the
desire of victory and applause, their pre-engage∣ment
in a party, and their shame and unwillingness
to yield; and strive to render them meek and
pliable, and sincerely desirous to know the truth.
When this is obtained, they will either be more
easily convinced, or more excuseable, if through
weakness they still continue in their errors<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Scougal.</NOTE>. He
should, by friendly discourse, discover what led
them into their errors, and then he will know
better how to lead them out again. A minister
ought not to despair of convincing dissenters, or
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
persons in an error, upon a few unsuccessful
attempts. Men's principles really depend so much
on their education, that it is not to be expected
that a hasty conference or a short dispute should
prevail with those who have been long habituated
to false principles, and sucked them in with their
nurse's milk, to abandon them all at once.
They must be treated with great patience and
long-suffering, and wrought upon by arguments
frequently repeated. A minister must visit them
often in a spirit of love, and offer them confer∣ences.
He may likewise direct them to such books
as are fittest for rectifying their mistakes, that they
may read and weigh them at leisure.</P>
<P>The emissaries of the church of Rome sometimes
make an impression on those whom they want to
convert, by this argument, that it is safest to join
their church, because Protestants themselves allow
the possibility of salvation in it, whereas Papists
allow no possibility of salvation out of it. This
may have weight with very weak persons; but a
small degree of understanding may satisfy a man,
that an uncharitable, judging, damning spirit, is no
probable mark of the true Christian church. A
minister ought not to adopt this conduct, or to
attempt to magnify the differences between sects
and parties, in order to make proselytes. Indeed,
the errors of some parties are so gross, and have so
direct an influence on practice, that it needs no
exaggeration to show persons the necessity of quit∣ting
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
them. Insidelity, for instance, implies a total
rejection of Christianity, and therefore must be
attended with the most dreadful hazard. In
Popery, Christianity is so corrupted and over∣clouded
with idolatry, superstition, and tyranny,
as renders it very difficult for those of that commu∣nion
to direct their endeavours to true holiness.
Quakers reject many of the essential institutions of
the gospel. Some parties, as seceders and inde∣pendents,
adopt antinomianism, and thus make
void the law by faith. Some parties too are ruled
by a bitter spirit, inconsistent with that love which
is the end of the commandment, which is our
Saviour's new and peculiar commandment, which
is greater than faith and hope; and they thus
destroy Christian charity. A minister may justly
represent such errors as these as highly dangerous,
and should set himself with a proportionable zeal
to correct them in those in his parish who may be
infected with them. There are other differences
among Protestants, which have not so great influ∣ence
on practice, and therefore are of less conse∣quence.
A minister should not attempt to magnify
these. On the contrary, he should show how
insufficient they are to interrupt the course of
Christian love, or to produce division; how justly,
notwithstanding them, Christians may live in com∣munion
together; and therefore urge them to
maintain the unity of the church, not to rent it,
not unnecessarily to make a schism or separation
from that profession which is established in the
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
country. But he must: always carefully avoid
laying great stress on party distinctions, and incul∣cate
the far superior importance of real holiness and
goodness. While he allows that they may be
saved, notwithstanding their present errors, which
they hold honestly and mistake for truth, if they
be really holy; he must inculcate on them,
that though they renounce these errors, though
their opinions be true in all respects, yet they can∣not
be saved without holiness. Though he should
proselyte a thousand to his own party, he must
think that he has done nothing, till he make them
likewise truly religious and holy; for without this,
no man can be saved in any religion. Better
persuade one person to be truly holy, than bring
over ten thousand to the purest sect among
Christians.</P>
<P>There are some cases, in which convincing, as
well as rebuking, ceases to be a minister's duty.
He must always strenuously oppose all notions
which directly tend to promote licentiousness and
vice, that if he cannot reclaim those who have
embraced them, he may at least prevent others
from being infected with them. But there are
many differences of opinion about lesser matters,
which, as they are unavoidable, can scarce be said
to deserve great regard. Besides, whenever per∣sons
are so much under the power of prejudice, as
to be bigotted in their own way, all a minister's
pains would be in vain. It will often happen, that
<PB N="205" REF="212"/>
all his arguments cannot convince those with whom
he disputes. When they are honest in their
belief, and live as becomes Christians, he should
not, on this account, cease to treat them with the
greatest kindness and regard; he will thus show
them, that the love of truth, not desire of con∣quest,
was his motive in endeavouring to convince
them.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of reconciling Differences.</HEAD>
<P>IT is often another duty incumbent on a minister
to endeavour to reconcile differences, and extin∣guish
animosities among his parishioners. Warm
benevolence will lead every good man to do his
utmost to promote peace and concord; and our
Saviour has strongly recommended this exercise of
benevolence, by pronouncing “the peace-makers
blessed, for they,” says he, “shall be called the
children of God<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 9.</NOTE>.” It is indeed necessary for
all men, but especially for a minister, because the
consequences of his giving such offence will be
worse, not to be forward or over-busy in meddling
in the affairs or quarrels of others. It often hap∣pens,
that a person by this offends one, or, it may
<PB N="206" REF="213"/>
be, both parties; and if a minister offend a person
by being thought to be partial against him, it will
probably be for ever out of his power to be useful
to him. For this reason, a minister should always
avoid deciding the differences of his people, as a
judge or arbiter; for if either party should be dis∣pleased
with his sentence, it will produce reflections
on his character for integrity; and these must
always diminish his esteem. All his endeavours to
reconcile differences must be of a more private
nature, and in a way more suited to his profession.
In addressing himself to either party, without
blaming him as if he were absolutely in the wrong,
or even supposing him to be as much injured as he
thinks himself, he may yet inculcate the obligation
of forgiveness, and display the beauty of placabi∣lity.
And resentment tends so much to aggravate
the faults which are the objects of it, and makes
men so unwilling to consider things in a fair light,
that we may almost promise, that if a minister can
once convince the persons who are at variance,
that it is their duty to forgive, and bring them to
wish that they were able to practise it, and thus
awaken that general benevolence which resentment
had extinguished, they will of themselves perceive,
that their passions have represented the grounds of
their difference as much more considerable than
they really are, and be almost ashamed of their
dissension. Men often come to this when their
resentment cools; and the only thing which pre∣vents
their reconciliation is a shyness to make the
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
first advances, or an uncertainty in each, whether
the other party be as much disposed to it as him∣self.
A minister may often be of use to them in
this situation, by assuring them of each other's
good disposition, and by using other prudent
means of bringing them together.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. IX.</HEAD>
<P>Of Care of the Poor.</P>
<P>IT is incumbent on a minister, to search out
the poor and indigent in his parish, and to contrive
means for supplying them. While the idle, the
impudent, and clamorous poor make their ne∣cessities
known, and obtain relief, there are many
honest, modest, and industrious persons, who are
contented to pine in poverty and straits, rather
than make their situation known, These are the
properest objects of charity, whom every pious
Christian should search out, and relieve according
to his ability: but this is peculiarly the duty of a
minister.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Christian church, when
the rich sold their possessions for the common sup∣port
of the brethren, they brought the price to the
apostles, who took care of the distribution, accord∣ing
to every man's need<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Acts, iv. 35.</NOTE>; and one of them, Peter,
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
inflicted death on Ananias and Sapphira, for de∣frauding
the poor<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Acts, v.</NOTE>. And though afterwards, when
the number of the disciples increased, the apostles
appointed deacons to have the immediate care of
the poor, while they gave themselves up wholly
“to prayer and to the ministry of the word<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Acts, vi. 4.</NOTE>;”
yet we find that the apostles thought themselves
still obliged to interest themselves very particularly
in obtaining provision for the poor, on many differ∣ent
occasions. Paul and Barnabas were careful to
carry relief, from the church at Antioch, to the
Christians in Judea, in the prospect of the great
dearth of which Agabus had prophesied<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Acts, xi. 27, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Paul
had not only undertaken the distribution of the
liberal charity, which the Macedonians had given
for the relief of the saints at Jerusalem, but like∣wise
by their example, and by many other argu∣ments,
he excites the Corinthians to contribute
largely for the same purpose<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If a minister be assiduous in the practice of the
several duties which have been already explained,
he will thence derive great advantages for the dis∣charge
of this duty. His conversing with his peo∣ple
and instructing them in private, will give him
many opportunities of discovering their situation,
without his seeming to inquire into it. And his
<PB N="209" REF="216"/>
showing all the concern he can, to supply their
wants and mend their situation, will increase their
confidence in him, and add new authority and
weight to all his instructions and advices. They
will easily believe that he sincerely wishes well to
their souls, who is anxious for their bodies, and
that all his exhortations proceed from his real
sense of their being absolutely necessary for them.</P>
<P>There are many different ways which a minister
may take, for supplying the poor in his parish,
according to the variety of their rank and circum∣stances.
These he must attend to with prudence;
otherwise, what he designs well, may offend and
irritate, by the manner in which it is bestowed.
There are some, whom he may all at once, with∣out
any ceremony, either supply out of his own
charity, as he is able, or recommend to the cha∣ritable
funds of the parish. Many, who would
have been backward to apply for relief, will yet
readily and thankfully accept of it, even in this or∣dinary
way, when it is procured to them without
its being asked. But many stand really in need of
relief, who yet, on account of their rank or other
circumstances, will not care to receive it in this
public way. To these, a minister may sometimes
convey his own charity privately. Sometimes he
may obtain for them relief, from persons who are
disposed to bestow, and able to bestow more libe∣rally
than he himself can afford, and who will,
either by him, or by other means, convey it to
<PB N="210" REF="217"/>
them in a private and inoffensive way. When a
minister can neither afford himself to give, nor
procure from other private persons for them, that
relief which their situation demands; and when, at
the same time, they could not bear to be regarded
as objects of public charity, it may be possible, in
some cases, for him to procure something from the
public charitable funds, to be privately bestowed
by himself. But this should not be often at∣tempted.
Men are so apt to misconstrue the actions
of ministers, and it is of so great moment that they
should not lie open to any suspicion of misapplying
charitable funds, that it will be generally most pru∣dent
for them not to desire to distribute any part
of them, but to persons whom they expressly name.
Individuals may, perhaps, sometimes suffer by this
reserve; but by neglecting it, a minister's own re∣putation,
and consequently his usefulness, may be
wholly ruined. There are often persons in a pa∣rish
who cannot be said to be indigent, or to stand
in need of alms, who yet would often receive
great advantage by having the use of a little money
at particular junctures. A minister may sometimes
do important service to whole families, by lending
small sums, without interest, to such honest and
industrious persons, to assist them in particular
emergencies, or to enable them to catch occasions
of profit. A man ought not indeed to straiten his
own family in order to do this, and many ministers
are in so narrow circumstances, that they can scarcely
do it at all, without straitening them. But, if a mi∣nister
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
have a little money, he may, in this way, at
the expence of a very few shillings, and with the
risk of a very few pounds, not only make several
families happy, but obtain both the love and esteem
of many in his parish, and greatly increase his
power of being useful.</P>
<P>It is certainly the duty of a minister, to take care
of the charitable funds of the parish, both that they
be preserved, and that they be well applied. The
want of knowlege in business may sometimes lead
to errors in the former case; but conscience re∣quires
that all possible pains should be taken to
supply that want by proper advice: to expose what
is given for the support of the poor, knowingly to
any risk of being lost, would be base. In apply∣ing
them, the leading principle should be, to cause
them to do as much good, relieve as much distress,
and promote as much happiness, as possible. If
this be kept in view, it will give direction in most
of the particular cases which occur.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Private Duties respecting lesser Societies.</HEAD>
<P>THE duties of a minister which we have hi∣therto
considered are, in the strictest sense,
private, because separate and distinct individuals
are the objects of them. There are other duties
of the pastoral office which are of a private nature,
yet have bodies of men for their objects, or, at
least, are, from their nature, performed in the pre∣sence
of families, or of a number together. We
shall now proceed to these which are of a middle
kind between the most private and the most public
duties of the ministerial office.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Visitation of Families.</HEAD>
<P>THE first duty of this kind is Visitation of fami∣lies,
when a minister goes through his parish,
assembling each family by themselves, or two or
three families together. In this round through his
parish, a minister may do several things which are
extremely useful, and which this is the best op∣portunity
of doing. At this time, a minister forms
a roll or catalogue of his parishioners, according
<PB N="213" REF="220"/>
to which he calls them to be catechised, and by
which he may know whether they all attend him.
This, of itself, is far from being useless, as it will
be a check on those who, through a consciousness
of ignorance, an averseness to learn, or any other
bad principle, might be prone to avoid examina∣tion.
At this time, likewise, a minister may most
conveniently obtain the knowlege of strangers who
have come into his parish from other places, and
enquire into their characters and their attestations.
This will be often of use for preventing disorderly
persons, who might corrupt others by their vices,
from settling in a parish. As our Saviour, when
he sent forth, first, his twelve apostles, and after∣wards,
the seventy disciples, to preach the gospel,
commanded them, into whatever house they went,
to say, “Peace be to this house;” so a minister
ought to join with his visit to any family, sincere
devotion and earnest prayer, particularly for the
spiritual and temporal happiness of that family.
A minister may likewise render this part of his
labour subservient to other good purposes, particu∣larly
to recommending such duties as are properly
economical, or relative to a family. This will be
a proper opportunity of instructing them in the
nature, and exciting them to the practice, of all
the relative duties. He may enquire how the
husband and wife behave to each other, give them
directions for the practice of their several duties,
point out to them many faults of conduct, which
would not perhaps have been attended to by them∣selves,
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
which yet are both transgressions of their
duty, and will diminish their happiness in each
other, and their authority in the family. He may
examine the masters and the servants, how they
treat each other, direct the former to kindness,
and the latter to obedience and fidelity. He may
inculcate on parents the obligation of taking care
of the virtuous education of their children, give
them familiar directions about the right manner
of it, warn them against the faults that are gene∣rally
fallen into, show them the necessity of train∣ing
them to industry, and fitting them for some
lawful calling. He should recommend family re∣ligion,
particularly the reading of the scriptures,
and inspecting the behaviour of all within the
house. A visit to a family is one of the properest
opportunities of giving instructions, exhortations,
Or reproofs, on such subjects as these.</P>
<P>It happens often, especially in country parishes,
that several families are convened together. In
this case, besides what has been already mentioned,
a minister has a fit opportunity of enquiring, on
what terms they live with one another, of examin∣ing
into the grounds of any differences which pre∣vail
among them, and into the occasions, which,
from their situation, produce disputes more fre∣quently
among them; and he may contribute
greatly to establish good neighbourhood and har∣mony,
by directing them how to avoid these con∣tentions,
by reconciling their differences, and urg∣ing
<PB N="215" REF="222"/>
the obligation of Christian concord. This may
likewise be a fit opportunity of exciting them to
brotherly admonition. As it is the duty, not only
of ministers, but of all Christians, to exhort one
another on proper occasions, a minister may direct
neighbours to keep an eye on the conduct of each
other, to admonish each other privately whenever
they find one another guilty of a fault, or wanting
in any duty. By this means, they may be ren∣dered
useful monitors to each other; the more
knowing may contribute to the instruction of the
ignorant, and the regular and virtuous to the
amendment of those who are not so well disposed.
A minister may render visitation of families still
farther useful, by accompanying it with catechising.
This might make it tedious and laborious in very
large and populous parishes; but in small parishes,
and even in all except the very largest, it may be
easily accomplished in so moderate a time as no
man will grudge, who enters into the spirit of his
employment. By this means, a parish may be
catechised twice, with very little additional trouble
to the minister.</P>
<P>Visiting families begins to be neglected by some
ministers, as a less useful part of their employment;
but they who neglect it, seem not to attend to the
good purposes to which it may be rendered sub∣servient.
It seems to be naturally implied in teach∣ing
“from house to house;” it is expressly en∣joined
by the laws of our church; and a minister
<PB N="216" REF="223"/>
who first performs it, or thinks of performing it
in so careless and formal a manner as to render it
useless, and then neglects it because he finds it
useless, is plainly wanting in his duty, and omits
one thing, by which he might, in a great degree,
and in some peculiar ways, promote the good of
his people. This part of a minister's work should
generally be performed once every year; and that
season should be chosen for it when the people are
most at home, when they are least engaged in
work, and can attend with least inconvenience;
a season of this sort in the summer will be most
commodious for the minister, who is obliged to
go through the whole parish. As the intermissions
of labour are not very long, a minister should con∣trive,
as much as possible, to visit his whole parish
during the continuance of them; but he should,
at the same time, not hurry it so much, as to oblige
him to go through it in a superficial or merely
formal way. If a parish be so very large, as to
render it necessary, either to visit it hastily, or to
encroach upon the busy seasons of the year, it may
be proper, either to visit the whole parish, in the
way we have described, one year, and catechise,
without visiting it, the next; or, every year to
visit one half, and catechise the other.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Catechising.</HEAD>
<P>THIS brings us to the next duty, Catechising.
This has been considered in all ages as the properest
method of communicating the knowlege of every
subject. A particular species of it was the only
method which Socrates used for either confuting
errors, or leading men to the knowlege of the
truth. It is plain from scripture, that this method
was used for bringing converts to the knowlege of
the gospel. Luke tells Theophilus, that he wrote
his gospel on purpose that he “might know the
certainty of those things wherein he had been
<HI>instructed;</HI>” it is in the greek, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,

in the way of the Lord<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Acts, xviii. 25.</NOTE>;” the greek
word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signified initiated, or informed
by catechising. As this is indeed one of the pro∣perest
methods of instructing, especially the young
and the ignorant, it is to be considered as recom∣mended
by all the exhortations which are given
ministers to “teach.” We know that it has been
always used in the Christian church, and that con∣verts
<PB N="218" REF="225"/>
to Christianity were, by this method, very
carefully instructed in the nature of that religion,
before they were baptized, and on this account
were, during the time that passed before their
baptism, called Catechumens. This method of
instruction has many advantages. It keeps up the
attention much better than a continued discourse.
It gives opportunity of observing how far a subject
is understood, and of illustrating it till it be under∣stood.
It tends to make things better retained.
It serves to explain those terms which often occur
in preaching, and which, however familiar they
may be to the preacher, might be dark to many of
the hearers, or be misunderstood by them; and
will thus prove an excellent preparation for their
attending to sermons with understanding and
advantage. But its obligation and utility will
be easily acknowleged; it is more necessary to
consider the best manner of performing it.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned, that, catechising
may be very properly joined with visitation of
families; not that, when it is thus joined, it should
be thought sufficient. It ought to be likewise per∣formed
by itself. Sometimes a minister may find it
convenient to do this likewise, by assembling several
families together in their own neighbourhood;
but generally it is most convenient to call them to
the church, or to his own house; the fatigue of
coming once is inconsiderable to each of them,
whereas it would be a great toil for him to go
<PB N="219" REF="226"/>
through them all. The winter months, when they
are little taken up with their business, will be gene∣rally
found most convenient for this, and are for
the most part chosen. It is sometimes, too, eli∣gible
to spend a part of Sunday afternoon in cate∣chising,
especially in the spring, immediately before
afternoon sermon be begun, and in autumn, imme∣diately
after it is given over. A great many
can then attend without any interruption to their
work, and receive at least, from hearing others
examined, some instruction in the principles of
religion.</P>
<P>It is by no means sufficient, that the people be
able to say a catechism by rote; they are perfectly
ignorant till they know the meaning of all the
words and propositions in it; and the absurd an∣swers
which the common people often give to the
questions of the most common catechism, show
that they may have the whole by heart, without
really understanding any part of the subject of it.
A minister's chief care therefore ought to be, to
bring them, not to repeat, but to understand the
catechism; and this may be done almost with the
stupidest, by means of plain explications and easy
illustrations. Answering to the questions of a
catechism should not be made a mere exercise of
memory; it may be no more, even when they
understand what they repeat. It should be made,
as much as possible, an exercise of judgment. In
order to this, such questions should be put, as may
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
lead them gradually to discover of themselves, and
to give, in their own words the answer which they
should have given, and about which they were at
a loss. This method of leading men, by well-con∣trived
questions, from some easy and known prin∣ciple
to the discovery which we want them to make,
is properly the Socratic method of instruction. It
requires some genius and dexterity in the questioner
to pursue this method on any subject; but if he be
capable of it, it will render catechising an agree∣able
and entertaining exercise to himself; whereas,
in the way it is commonly managed, it is a dry and
tedious labour. It will likewise be highly profit∣able
for the learner. It will make those whose
memory is naturally weak, to attain almost as
much real knowlege, as they who have stronger
memories: it will render their conceptions distinct
and determinate: and when they are thus led to
deduce all their knowlege from easy principles,
conviction will necessarily attend all their concep∣tions.
They will comprehend religion, and, at the
same time, perceive the truth of its several parts.
This manner of examination which we propose,
will probably be easily comprehended by all of you,
however difficult it may sometimes be to reduce it
to practice.</P>
<P>It is a fault in most catechisms, that they abound
too much in technical and systematic terms. This
is one great occasion both of people's getting them
merely by rote, and of their not understanding
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
them. It were much better that these terms were
confined altogether to controversial writings, and
used neither in sermons nor in catechisms. But as
they are often used in both, they should, in cate∣chising,
be explained in as easy and familiar a
manner as possible, that, when they occur in
preaching, they may not be unintelligible. It is
likewise a fault in most catechisms, that the prin∣ciples
of religion, and the precepts of it, are kept
too much distinct, and laid down in different parts.
By this means the practical tendency of the christian
doctrines does not appear; their connection with
holiness is not pointed out; the duties of religion
are explained, but they are not enforced by the
proper motives. These inconveniences should be
remedied in catechising. No question relating to
any doctrine of religion should be dismissed, with∣out
showing its influence on practice, and the
force with which it recommends holiness. In
examining, again, on every question relating to
duty, the peculiar obligations of that duty should
be brought into view. All this may be accom∣plished
by proper questions put in the way that we
have already described. But with these, it will be
very proper, that a minister frequently intermix
short exhortations to the due improvement of the
principles of religion, by the careful practice of
every duty.</P>
<P>It is but a small part of a catechism that a mini∣ster
can ask at every particular person; yet the
<PB N="222" REF="229"/>
design of catechising is to instruct persons in the
whole scheme of religion. In order to effect this,
a minister must call as many together to be cate∣chised,
as he can go through, without either ren∣dering
the examination of each superficial, or immo∣derately
fatiguing himself. The increase of labour
at every particular meeting will be compensated, in
some degree, by the smaller number of meetings.
He must endeavour at each meeting to go through
the whole catechism; by which means, all who
are present may be instructed in all the parts of
religion. In order to make room for this, it will
be proper to pass slightly over such things as are of
lesser moment, and to dwell chiefly on those things
of which the people seem most ignorant, or which
are of greatest importance, and most immediately
connected with practice.</P>
<P>The duty of catechising should be diligently
practised, especially with regard to the young. It
is by this means that they can best learn the great
articles of the christian religion: if they do not
learn them then, they will scarce ever learn them
thoroughly; but if they then learn them, they will
keep a fast hold of them to the end of their lives.
It is with the young that most benefit may be
expected from it; their minds are open to truth,
and pliable to goodness; on those who are already
confirmed either in ignorance or in vice, it cannot
be expected that so great an impression will be
made.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Fellowship Meetings.</HEAD>
<P>WE shall next make a few observations on a
custom which prevails in some places, but is not
universal, that of holding fellowship meetings. It
cannot be doubted, that meetings of private
Christians, either among themselves, or with their
minister, if they were managed aright, and judi∣ciously
employed in devotion and in exciting one
another to love and good works, might be attended
with very considerable advantages. But at the
same time it is plain from experience, that they
have seldom been managed aright, and that they
have in fact generally been attended with real
inconvenience. They are too much confined, as
all who choose are not admitted to them, though
their morals may be unexceptionable. They are
chiefly composed of persons who are disposed to
idleness, and think they cannot mind religion,
without neglecting their worldly business and many
of the social duties of life; of such persons as are
conceited of their knowlege, on account of their
dipping into abstruse and disputable subjects, or of
their peculiar sanctity, on account of the orthodoxy
of their opinions; of such persons as place almost
the whole of religion in a punctual observance
of the ceremonial duties of it, and thus substitute
<PB N="224" REF="231"/>
superstition in the place of holiness; of such per∣sons
as are under the influence of a weak and igno∣rant
enthusiasm; and, in a word, of such as think
they derive great merit from their attending such
meetings, and on that account regard themselves as
the only godly persons, and despise others, who
are perhaps much better and more virtuous than
they. The consequence of persons of such cha∣racters
meeting together is generally to promote
their spirit of superstition, to foster their enthu∣siasm,
to flatter their hypocrisy, to cherish their
conceit and spiritual pride, and their pharisaical
contempt of others. When they are met, the
spirit that reigns in them will make their conver∣sation
tend rather to pervert, than to improve,
their religious sentiments: their spirit, joined with
their ignorance, will render their devotions often
full of absurdities and extravagance. This has
been so generally the effect of these meetings, the
abuse, of them has been so frequent, that it appears
to me, they should rather be shunned upon the
whole, than courted by a minister. If they have
not been customary in his parish, it will be better
not to introduce them. All the good effects that
could be expected from them will be much more
certainly and more effectually promoted by the
occasional private instructions and exhortations
which we have formerly recommended, and by
exciting those who live in the same neighbourhood
to converse about religion, and admonish each
other, in the way that we have already hinted.
<PB N="225" REF="232"/>
and they will be promoted by this means, without
the danger of those abuses which have often arisen
from formal meetings. If a minister find that
meetings of this sort have been already introduced
into his parish, it can seldom be prudent to attempt
to discourage, or to abolish them, all at once.
This would only irritate the people, and in a great
measure destroy the minister's usefulness. If he
should refuse to attend them, the people would
hold them by themselves, and be apt to proceed
to a greater height of extravagance, than if he
were present. He ought therefore to set himself
to establish such regulations, as may tend to pre∣vent
the abuses of them, and render them subser∣vient
to a good purpose. He should take care to
be always present at them himself. He should
appoint them to be held at such times as may not
interfere, either with their worldly business, or
with other duties. He should take care that they
be not confined to a particular set of people of a
pharisaical spirit, but that all who are unexcep∣tionable
in their morals have free access to them.
He should take care that all subjects to be discoursed
on be proposed at a previous meeting. He should
hinder every subject from being introduced, that
tends to lead men into useless speculations, intri∣cate
disputes, or superstitious and enthusiastical
notions. He should allow only such subjects to be
introduced, as have a real tendency to make men
wiser and better, by either explaining or enforcing
the duties of religion; and he ought to lead them
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
to consider them in those views in which they
tend most strongly to produce this effect, and to
keep them to this way of Considering them. He
should recommend it to the people to consider the
subject carefully by themselves, before they venture
to speak on it in the presence of others. When
any of them vent any thing absurd or enthusiastic,
they should be immediately checked and corrected.
None should pray, but those who are desired by
the minister; and when they utter any thing extra∣vagant
in prayer, it should not only be pointed out
to them, but they should be hindered from attempt∣ing
it again for some time, till they learn to think
more soberly and justly. The minister should
always be careful to inculcate on them, that they
are no better than their neighbours merely for
attending these meetings; that they are only useful
so far as they are means of rendering them more
virtuous in their ordinary conduct. By such
means as chese, a minister of prudence may, in a
great measure, prevent the abuse of fellowship
meetings, and turn them to real advantage: and
when he finds that they are already introduced into
a parish, and that the people are fond of them, it
will generally be better to model them, in this way,
into an useful form, than to attempt abolishing
them altogether.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Marrying.</HEAD>
<P>To these duties we may add Marrying; but
it will not require many words. It is by law
committed to ministers, and from its solemn and
important nature, there are good reasons why it
should be so.</P>
<P>It is their duty to do all they can to prevent
marriages in any way improper, by advice and
persuasion. If these prove ineffectual, and if the
impropriety lie only in some imprudence, or some
inequality between the parties, the minister must
allow them to judge for themselves; to refuse to
marry them, would be assuming an authority to
which he has no right. But there may be impro∣prieties
of such a kind and degree, as to justify or
even require this; for instance, if one of the
parties be under age, and plainly drawn in by the
art of the other, it would be a just reflection on a
minister to solemnize their marriage. Some mar∣riages
are so confessedly unlawful, that not to
refuse absolutely to celebrate them would be highly
criminal.</P>
<P>A minister may be sometimes desired to cele∣brate
marriages which are in themselves unexcep∣tionable,
<PB N="228" REF="235"/>
in an irregular manner, or without the
ordinary forms of proclamation. There no doubt
are cases in which the omission of these cannot be
attended with any bad consequences. Yet it is
safest for a minister steadily to adhere to them.
There can never almost be a good reason for seek∣ing
to dispense with them; it is a caprice which
deserves no encouragement; it it really penal,
though there may be no danger of the penalty
being actually demanded. Such cases may be
pleaded as a precedent for his conduct in others,
where it is not so clear that bad consequences may
not follow; and by refusing in these, he incurs the
charge of inconsistence and partiality, or by com∣plying,
does what he thinks improper, or even
hazardous.</P>
<P>The form of marriage includes some instructions
concerning its nature and duties, and the marriage
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, with prayer before and after. All this is so
simple, that it must be unnecessary to enlarge
upon it.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of subordinate Duties.</HEAD>
<P>IF the several private duties, respecting both
individuals and societies, which we have hitherto
illustrated, be really incumbent on a minister, it
<PB N="229" REF="236"/>
will follow, that whatever is absolutely necessary
to the performance of them is in the same degree
incumbent on him, and that he is under some
obligation to whatever can contribute to his per∣forming
them in the best manner. Hence are de∣rived
several secondary or subordinate duties of the
pastoral office, the consideration of which will
serve for a proper conclusion of this part of the
subject.</P>
<P>The first of them is constant residence. If there
be no express command in scripture, imposing this
as a necessary duty, the reason is admitted even by
the Popish casuists to be, that the nature of the
office implies it, because it cannot be executed
without it; and every pastor being obliged to ex∣ecute
his office, is of course obliged to residence
as indispensable for that purpose. In the primitive
ages, the pastors of every church resided in it, ex∣cept
when they were driven away by persecution;
and even by this they were not easily prevailed
upon to desert it. In the original establishment of
parochial churches in every nation, the incumbents
were looked upon as strictly obliged to reside; and
it was on the supposition of their being so, that
glebes and houses were provided for them, in order
to render their residence commodious. After cor∣ruptions
in religion began to prevail, pastors some∣times
indulged themselves in absence from their
charges, for taking care of some worldly occupa∣tions
in which they were engaged, or for attend∣ance
<PB N="230" REF="237"/>
at the courts of emperors and kings: and in
the farther progress of these corruptions, the same
person possessed himself of two or more churches
or parishes, in one only of which he could re∣side.
These practices were, however, very ge∣nerally
condemned as gross abuses; and, from
their first appearance, even prohibited by the ca∣nons
of successive councils. These canons began,
in course of time, to admit some exceptions; first,
by allowing one man to hold two churches when
a sufficient number of fit persons could not be
found for providing each with a separate pastor;
next, when one church was so poor as not to
afford a competent and sufficient maintenance;
afterwards for reasons far less reasonable, as in fa∣vour
of persons of high birth, or eminently learned,
or dignified in Universities, who, on dispensations
being granted by the Pope, might hold a plurality
of benefices. By means of these exceptions, along
with the facility of procuring dispensations, the
abuse rose to so great a height, that many remote
benefices were often accumulated in one person;
for remedying which, the Council of Trent made
several decrees; and though these did not take
away all dispensations, they have rendered appli∣cations
for them, and consequently both non-resi∣dence
and pluralities, less frequent in the church
of Rome than they formerly were. In England,
a law had passed some time before that council,
and before the establishment of the Reformation,
which, by admitting the exceptions introduced in
<PB N="231" REF="238"/>
the most corrupt ages, gave them a sanction in
that church: and it has never been formally re∣pealed.
Under the authority of it, non-residence,
on account of pluralities as well as on other pre∣tences,
continues to prevail; though it has always
been condemned by many, and pronounced to be
contrary to the declared sense of the church, parti∣cularly
in its public offices, and unjustifiable in
point of conscience<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccles. Cas. 1. p. 23. Cas. 2. p. 158. Cas. 3.
p. 213. Burnet's Past. Care, ch. v. vi. Seeker, Charge 1.
Cant.</NOTE>, Residence being indispens∣ably
required in our church, it is unnecessary for
me to inculcate the obligation of a minister to re∣side
ordinarily in his parish. Care of health, ne∣cessary
business, and other duties of different kinds,
may, doubtless, prevent residence in the strictest
sense continual, and justify absence for a short, and
sometimes a longer time: but even such induce∣ments
should be complied with sparingly, not ea∣gerly
catched at. Without living much at home,
a minister cannot perform the several duties of his
office, which recur almost every day, in such a
manner, as can either give full satisfaction to his
own mind, or yield the greatest benefit to his
people. To wander often abroad on needless visits
or amusement, exposes a minister to the contempt
of his people, alienates their affections, and impairs
<PB N="232" REF="239"/>
his usefulness. But to be always at hand, to ad∣vise,
direct, and inform them, to comfort the
afflicted and diseased, to awe the disorderly, to
give countenance to the well-behaved, to reconcile
their differences, to promote friendly offices, to
procure relief for the indigent, to answer quickly
and regularly the several calls which they may
have occasion to make upon him, will endear a
minister to his people, and add an incredible force
to all his instructions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccles. Cas. 1. p. 23. Cas. 2. p. 158. Cas. 3.
p. 213. Secker, Charge 1. Cant.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the same principles it is the duty of a mi∣nister,
to keep himself as much as possible disen∣gaged
from all occupations except those belonging
to his office: for the proper and careful perform∣ance
of its duties, together with the studies requi∣site
for that purpose, and the attention which his
own worldly affairs render indispensable, will be
sufficient to fill up all his time. No doubt there
are cases which ought to be excepted. Teaching
in any useful line is congenial to the proper busi∣ness
of a clergyman; some clergymen are well
qualified for it, and in situations which put it in
their power; and by engaging in it no farther than
is really consistent with all their pastoral duties,
they may not only innocently render their condi∣tion
more comfortable, but employ their time
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
laudably, improve themselves, be highly useful to
society, and even be kept more constantly at hand
for attendance upon their parochial functions. If
a clergyman understand medicine, he may prac∣tise
it in his neighbourhood to a certain degree,
without drawing him off from these functions:
and by this may not only better his circumstances,
and do much good to the bodies of men, but also
give assistance to such as could not otherwise have
procured it, multiply his opportunities of address∣ing
his people as a minister, and render them well
disposed to listen to his addresses on subjects of re∣ligion.
Some degree of attention to business, par∣ticularly
in the way of agriculture, the situation of
most clergymen renders necessary: but it can never
be proper to extend it beyond what is necessary.
If they engage so far in any secular employment
as to be immersed in it, they cannot have leisure
for all the duties which are incumbent on them,
they will contract a turn of mind unfavourable to
their always entering heartily into them, and there
is a risk, that it may put them on doing some
things which will not be deemed perfectly consist∣ent
with the purity and dignity of their character,
and which will, on that account, render them less
acceptable and useful in their proper station<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Stillingfleet, Eccles. Cas. 2. p. 157.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That a minister may perform the several duties
which we have enumerated, it is plainly necessary
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
for him to be often in the company of his people,
and to live in familiarity with them: and his per∣forming
these duties, on all fit occasions, when he
is in their company, will prevent all bad conse∣quences
from his familiarity. To be often in their
company, joining in their amusements, falling in
with the trifling, or conniving at the blameable
conversation in which they frequently engage, will
very easily produce an excessive familiarity of the
worst tendency. It cannot fail to destroy that re∣spect
and esteem which it is absolutely necessary for
him to maintain, in order to give weight to his
ministrations. But when, instead of that, he takes
every opportunity of introducing useful conversa∣tion,
of enlarging and correcting their knowlege,
of exciting them to their duty and directing them
in it, of giving them consolation, of doing them
good offices; he may be very often in their com∣pany,
not only without breeding any inconvenient
familiarity, but so as to raise their esteem, and in∣crease
their love to him. If some of them should
have even entertained prejudices against him, he
will, by this means, most effectually wear them
off: when they find him thus solicitous for their
improvement and salvation, they will drop them of
their own accord, and labour to make amends for
them, by the warmth of their affection.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Public Duties, respecting a whole Parish.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Preaching.</HEAD>
<P>AS we are now come to the public duties of the
pastoral office, we shall begin with Preaching,
both because it will require a fuller consideration than
the rest, and because, being one very considerable
mean of instruction, it is nearest akin to the pri∣vate
duties, which we have hitherto chiefly illus∣trated.
Preaching is so natural a method of teach∣ing,
is so often enjoined in the New Testament,
and is so fully recommended by the example of
our Saviour and his apostles, that it has always
been acknowleged an important part of the office
of a minister; and therefore it will be unnecessary
to spend time in proving that it is incumbent on
him. Nor do we propose to lay before you a
complete system of the rules of preaching, de∣duced
from the general principles of composition,
or traced up to their source in the constitution of
human nature. We shall content ourselves with
proposing some of the principal rules of it, in
such a way as may both convince you of their
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
justness, and render them easily applicable to prac∣tice.</P>
<P>We shall not attempt any precise general defini∣tion
of Preaching; it might be difficult to contrive
one which would fully take in all its varieties; and
the consideration of these varieties will supersede
the necessity of it. It is plain that Preaching is the
delivering a discourse, which tends to promote the
salvation of mankind, by instructing them in the
knowlege of their duty, and exciting them to the
practice of it, and to the love of goodness. This
being its design, “it is certainly,” to use the
words of Bishop Burnet, “a noble and profitable
exercise, if rightly gone about; of great use both
to the priest and people, by obliging the one to
much study and labour, and by setting before
the other full and copious discoveries of divine
matters, opening them clearly, and pressing
them weightily upon them. It has also now
gained such esteem in the world, that a clergy∣man
cannot maintain his credit, nor bring his
people to a constant attendance on the worship
of God, unless he is happy in these perform∣ances<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Pastoral Care, ch. ix.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The general end of Preaching, the promoting
the religious and moral improvement of man∣kind,
all preachers have professed to aim at,
though they have taken very different methods,
<PB N="237" REF="244"/>
and the fashion of Preaching has, like all other
fashions, undergone many changes. In the be∣ginning
of Christianity, Preaching was extremely
simple; it consisted almost wholly of plain practical
exhortations; it has since been sometimes joined
with all the ornaments of rhetoric, and sometimes
with all the subtlety of scholastic philosophy. In
the dark ages, it was little else than panegyric on
the Romish saints: after the Reformation, it was
employed about the doctrines and duties of reli∣gion,
but with too great a mixture of controversy:
the several changes which it has since undergone,
may be traced in the sermons to which there is easy
access. It would be curious and entertaining to
trace it through the various forms it has assumed,
and to point out its most considerable revolutions.
But a complete history of this would be long; and
so far as it is either necessary or proper to hint at it,
we shall have occasion to take notice of some of
the most remarkable forms of Preaching, in illus∣trating
its particular rules.</P>
<P>Preaching is one sort of public speaking; the
eloquence of the pulpit is one branch of eloquence.
A preacher differs from one who speaks in the
senate or at the bar, only in the subject which he
treats, and in the end which he pursues. These
differences will occasion some varieties in the man∣ner
of speaking which he is to use; but still the
peculiar rules of Preaching arise from the general
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
principles of eloquence, the same principles which
are the source of all other sorts of composition.
A particular comparison of the eloquence of the
pulpit with that of the bar or the senate, in order
to discover their agreements and their differences,
would be curious, and might illustrate all of them;
but it is not so absolutely necessary to our present
design, as to require our entering on a full discus∣sion
of it. We shall only remark in general, that
on account of their agreements and analogy,
many of the rules laid down by the ancients for
the bar of the senate, are applicable to the pulpit;
but in applying them to it, judgement must be
employed, on account of the circumstances in
which they differ. It would be easy, from the
comparison we have hinted at, to deduce the supe∣rior
importance of christian oratory to all other
kinds, both in respect of its subject and its end;
to point out the advantages which the christian
orator has above all others, from the sublimity and
moment of the topics on which he insists, and of
the motives which he urges; and to show the disad∣vantages
under which he lies, in comparison with
others, particularly from the spiritual nature of the
subjects on which he insists, and from its being his
business to excite men, not to some one action,
which may be performed immediately, but to a
general course of behaviour. But these things you
will be able to prosecute, if you find it necessary,
by yourselves.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="246"/>
The ancient rhetoricians distinguished orations
into three kinds, the nature and rules of which
they delivered very particularly: 1. Deliberative,
which were employed about something future,
about what was to be done; and for these, there
were frequent opportunities in the senate and
popular assemblies in Greece and Rome, where
public measures were concerted and resolved upon.
Such orations aimed either at <HI>persuading</HI> to, or
<HI>dissuading</HI> from, certain actions or conduct; and
the topics on which they turned were, the honour
or dishonour, the justice or injustice, the advantage
or disadvantage, of the measures proposed. Many
sermons might be reduced to this class; all such as
aim at persuading to virtue in general, or to any
particular virtue, from its obligations, its excel∣lence,
its advantages here and hereafter, or at dis∣suading
from vice, by the opposite topics. 2. Judi∣cial,
which regarded the past, and belonged to
the criminal courts; they were employed in accu∣sing
or in defending, and made use both of facts
and arguments for these purposes. Sermons which
are employed in defending any character approved
in scripture from objections that have been raised
against it, are of the same kind with judicial
orations. So are all sermons, in some measure,
whose business it is to vindicate religion in general,
or any particular doctrine or duty which has been
attacked as unreasonable, absurd, unworthy of
God, hurtful to men; or to expose any error or
vice which has been recommended under the oppo∣site
<PB N="240" REF="247"/>
views; only these latter have things for their
objects, not, like the former, persons. 3. De∣monstrative,
which relate to something present,
and are employed either in praise or blame. They
were employed in panegyrics on the excellence of
persons, characters, conduct, laws, forms of
government, or whatever could admit of an enco∣mium;
and likewise, in invectives against persons
or things of an opposite nature. Of this kind
were all their funeral orations on eminent persons,
orations in meetings for the choice of fit persons
for offices, or for continuing or repealing laws.
To this class may be reduced sermons on the
excellence of any great character recorded in
scripture, on the excellence of Christianity, or
of any particular doctrine or virtue, or on the
deformity of vice. As the best rules for eloquence
are to be found in the writings of the ancient
rhetoricians, and as they apply their rules particu∣larly
to orations, according to this division of
them, it may be useful for you to consider, how
far, and in what respects, sermons are analogous to
these species of orations; for, so far as they are,
all the rules of the ancients regarding each kind,
will be applicable for your direction in the compo∣sition
of sermons. But this division is plainly
adapted to the several ends of speaking and sorts of
discourses, for which the constitutions of Greece
and Rome gave opportunity; it gives not the most
natural view of the variety of pulpit discourses,
though it may be in some measure accommodated
<PB N="241" REF="248"/>
to this; and therefore we shall arrange them under
a different division;</P>
<P>As eloquence, considered in its largest extent, is
the art of speaking so as to attain the end which
a man pursues; so from the variety of the ends
which may be attained by speaking, the most
natural division of eloquence may be deduced.
Now a man can scarcely be supposed to aim at any
end, but one or other of these; to instruct, to
convince, to please, to move, or to persuade; A
man who aims at instructing or at convincing,
addresses himself, though in different ways, to the
understanding; he who aims at pleasing, addresses
himself to the imagination; he who wants to
move, to the passions; and he who wants to per∣suade,
to the will. All these ends are allowed in
some sort of composition or another; and from
that end, the rules of that composition, which are
no more than the proper means of promoting its
main design, flow as from their source. But, from
the nature of Preaching, all these ends are scarcely
allowable in it. Some of them can never be in it
pursued for their own sakes, or ultimately, though
they may be used as means to something farther;
and therefore will not come in, in determining the
kinds of pulpit discourses.</P>
<P>To please, is an end which can scarcely ever be
ultimate to a preacher. A poet may be allowed to
rest in pleasing his readers, by presenting to their
<PB N="242" REF="249"/>
imaginations all that is sublime and beautiful, by the
novelty of his thoughts, and the harmony of his
numbers. This is indeed the sole end of pure
poetry or description, as distinguished from other
kinds of composition; and it aims at nothing but
in subservience to this end. If it convey just and
striking sentiments, if it move the passions, and
agitate the soul with various emotions, it is only
as a mean to prevent disgust, and to heighten the
delight. But it is only a small part even of poetry,
that rests wholly satisfied with giving pleasure. The
epic, the tragic, and all the greater kinds of
poetry, aim at something beyond it, and aim at
giving pleasure only as subordinate to instructing,
moving, or persuading. And if poets themselves
generally aim at a farther end than pleasure or
amusement, much more ought an orator constantly
to look beyond it: or, if it were allowable for the
orator at the bar or in the senate sometimes to aim
only at pleasing, at exciting the admiration of
men, at setting off his own ingenuity and parts,
and raising his reputation; yet even on that suppo∣sition
it could not be allowable in the preacher.
His function is so important, the character he
sustains is so grave and sacred, the subjects of
which he treats are so momentous, that it is inex∣cuseable
to spend any part of the time which men
allow for their being instructed in religion, and
excited to the duties of it, in merely amusing
them with ingenious thoughts and gaudy figures.
If a preacher only dazzle his hearers with the
<PB N="243" REF="250"/>
brightness of his sentiments, the vivacity of his
turns, or the beauty and propriety of his language,
he is a mere declaimer. A preacher ought never
to be actuated by a fond desire to please, in any of
his performances. All true eloquence is fit to
please; but pleasing is not its true or ultimate end.
It may however be allowed, that there is one way
in which the christian orator may properly enough
aim at pleasing; he may endeavour to raise admi∣ration
of a virtuous character or action. Admira∣tion
is one species of pleasure; it is not, properly
speaking, a passion, but a sentiment belonging to
the imagination; and the raising of admiration is
the only way in which a preacher can be allowed,
professedly and mainly, to address the imagination
of his hearers.</P>
<P>It is very seldom too, that moving can be the
ultimate end of a pulpit discourse. It is indeed
often necessary to move the passions in Preaching,
but not merely for the sake of moving them. The
passions are the great springs of action: in order to
persuade men to any course, it is always necessary
that the passions be moved, engaged, and directed
to their proper objects; but they may sometimes
be moved, without tending in any degree to per∣suasion;
and when this is the case, to move them
is not properly Preaching. There is but one case
in which a sermon can properly rest in this; when
it is designed to excite certain affections, which are
to be immediately exerted in the performance of
<PB N="244" REF="251"/>
some religious duty. When a sermon is intended
to be a preparation for the right performance of that
religious duty, it may be allowable to point the
whole of it at raising, to a great degree of fervour,
the devout affections suitable to that duty. Of this
kind is what is called an Action sermon. But
even in this case, as the devout affections which
should be raised tend directly to practice; as the
raising them to a considerable height tends to
render them habitually prevalent; and as the reli∣gious
duty in which they are exerted is a noble in∣strument
of virtuous practice, and directly subser∣vient
to it; the discourse may be considered as not
wholly resting in moving the passions, but tends in
some measure to persuasion, and therefore may be
included in that class, of which this is the main
and ultimate end. Thus, in dividing pulpit
discourses, it is not necessary to make a distinct
branch of those which aim at moving the
passions.</P>
<P>On these principles, we may divide all pulpit
discourses into four kinds: 1. Such as aim at
instruction or explication. 2. Such as aim at
convincing men of truth. 3. Such as aim at
raising admiration of a virtuous character or
action. 4. Such as aim at persuading men to
goodness.</P>
<DIV5 N="1">
<PB N="245" REF="252"/>
<HEAD>ART. I. Of Instructive or Explicatory Discourses.</HEAD>
<P>THE first sort of pulpit discourses are instructive
or explicatory discourses. They are addressed to
the understanding, to our powers of perception or
apprehension. Their design is simply to make the
hearers comprehend or know the nature and ex∣tent
of the subject. They may be reduced to dif∣ferent
kinds, according to the different subjects
which it properly belongs to a preacher to explain.
These subjects are three: 1. A passage of scrip∣ture.
2. A doctrine or duty of religion. 3. A
character.</P>
<P>1. As the Christian religion is contained in the
scriptures, and as it is proper that every Christian
should be able to read the scriptures with under∣standing,
the explication of a particular passage
of scripture is often a fit subject of a discourse from
the pulpit. This kind of discourse is already
marked out by the name of a Lecture, though we
must extend this name a little beyond ordinary
use, in order to take in all the discourses that pro∣perly
belong to this head. It is commonly rec∣koned
a discourse on a large passage of scripture;
for the most part, it should be so; but the extent
of the passage is not essential to the idea of a lec∣ture.
A lecture is any discourse designed to ex∣plain
the import of a particular passage of scrip∣ture,
Now, some passages of scripture are diffi∣cult;
<PB N="246" REF="253"/>
others are easy and practical. Hence will
arise two kinds of lectures, which we may call,
for distinction, critical, and practical.</P>
<P>The main design of a critical lecture is to give a
distinct view of the meaning of a passage of scrip∣ture.
In order to explain it, it is first of all ne∣cessary,
to find out the general design and scope
of the passage; for a clear view of this will throw
great light upon all the parts; and by exhibiting
a distinct comprehension of this to the audience,
they will be enabled to enter into all the particular
illustrations, and to perceive their whole force.
If, for example, a Psalm be the subject of lec∣ture;
when we can find out the author of it, the
occasion on which he composed it, his situation
when he composed it, what he had in view by it;
this will of itself often illustrate many of the ex∣pressions,
show the propriety of the sentiments,
give them a peculiar force and beauty, and render
the whole a lively picture of the author's soul, of
the different emotions to which he was subject, of
their conflicts with each other, and of the senti∣ments
and affections which prevailed and chiefly
influenced him. Whatever place of scripture be
pitched on, there is the same need for considering
the scope and occasion. It were easy to point out
many passages in the Gospels, where a different
view of the general design will lead to very different
explications of the particulars; and where, with∣out
fixing on the design, it is impossible to give
<PB N="247" REF="254"/>
any tolerable, or consistent explication of them at
all. In the Epistles, it is still more necessary; for
sometimes a whole Epistle, and always a large
portion of an Epistle, is a chain of reasoning all
tending to one point, either confirming or illus∣trating
it; and not to consider it in this light, is
to miss the whole meaning of the writer. You
need only look into any good commentator on any
paragraph of an Epistle, to be convinced how much
the understanding, and, by consequence, the ex∣plaining
of it depends on perceiving the general
scope. There are indeed some parts of scripture
in which no connection is preserved, but almost
all the sentences are unconnected, as particularly
the book of Proverbs; and there it is sufficient to
attend to the scope of each distinct aphorism.</P>
<P>It will follow from the observation that has been
already made, that it is proper to lecture on the
scriptures in the order in which they lie, or on a
book regularly from beginning to end; except the
Psalms, which being separate pieces, and not ranged
in the order in which they were written, may be
explained with equal propriety in almost any order;
for each may be considered as a distinct book. But
in other parts of scripture, it is by thus going re∣gularly
through a whole book that we can follow
the scope of the author, and unfold it gradually to
the hearers, with all that is said in order to pro∣mote
it. In going through any book of scripture,
one will sometimes come to verses which are plain
<PB N="248" REF="255"/>
enough to be understood by all. It is enough to
read these, without attempting any explication of
them; for this would both waste time needlessly,
and make the people imagine, either that they were
obscure, or that the preacher trifled. If a verse
contain any expressions that are obscure, it is ne∣cessary,
in explaining it, to ascertain the meaning
of these expressions, either from other places of
scripture where they are used, or by other easy and
convincing means. If any of the expressions be
metaphorical, it is proper to point out from what
the metaphor is taken, what is the force of it, and
how it is applied to the present subject. The
meaning of every difficult expression should be re∣presented
in as plain terms as possible. This is
often the first step towards an explication of a
verse. But a preacher must not rest here; for it
is not enough to find out the meaning of a single
expression; it is necessary to show the force which
it has in that particular place, and how, in con∣junction
with the other expressions, it tends to
make up the meaning of the whole. It is a great
fault in lecturing, to enlarge on every single ex∣pression,
as if it were a complete sense, and to
raise doctrines and observations from it in this way.
This is not to analize the scripture, but to mangle
it; it is not to explain it, but to play with it, to
speak about it and about it, to wrest and distort it.
When any obscure expressions which occur in a
verse are explained, it is next proper, putting the
explication of them, or plainer words in the place
<PB N="249" REF="256"/>
of them, to express the sense of the whole verse or
whole clause, as clearly, as shortly, and as strik∣ingly
as possible. If the verse be a simple, com∣plete,
and unconnected sense, no more is necessary
for the explication of it. If it be a proposition
laid down to be proved or illustrated, this must be
expressly taken notice of, that it may be kept in
view, and that the view of it may throw light on
all the arguments or illustrations produced in sup∣port
of it. If it be a part of a chain of reasoning,
or an argument or illustration of any particular
point, then, after the general sense of it is un∣folded,
its force for proving the point in hand, or
its influence in illustrating it, must be shown; for
this is absolutely necessary for explaining it as it
there stands. It often happens in scripture, that a
particular passage expresses some affection or tem∣per
of the person who writes it. In this case, it
cannot be truly explained by unfolding, in the
clearest manner, the import of every expression.
This would be only to represent the dead carcase
of the sentiment, but to miss the soul or spirit of
it. A preacher should endeavour to paint the
affection expressed, to the life, and to transfuse it
into his hearers. This is the case particularly
in the Psalms, and in all the places of scripture
which are devotional, This is no more than en∣tering
into the spirit of the author, which is con∣fessedly,
in every case, necessary for explaining
him. In lectures to a congregation, a display of
<PB N="250" REF="257"/>
critical knowlege is always improper; it is enough
that the preacher proceed upon the principles of
genuine criticism; he should seldom lay open these
principles to the congregation, for they cannot
enter into them, and will rather be perplexed by
them. For the same reason, it is improper to
mention a number of different explications of a
passage. It is generally best to give them the ex∣plication
that appears to be most probable, without
troubling them with any other, which would both
confound them, and perhaps lead them to think
the sense of scripture uncertain. In lecturing,
every thing should be expressed as shortly as possi∣ble,
for thus it will be best remembered; and as
clearly as possible, for this is necessary to explica∣tion,
the chief means of promoting which is per∣spicuity.</P>
<P>A lecture is a discourse which admits very little
ornament, very little of address either to the ima∣gination
or the passions. But it sometimes even
requires a little of both. As much as is necessary
to preserve attention is absolutely requisite, and at∣tention
can scarcely be preserved, where neither
the imagination is in any degree gratified, nor the
passions roused. But sometimes the nature of the
passage to be explained, demands more. When
it abounds with images, for instance, it is best ex∣plained
by unfolding them, and making them
more striking to the fancy, When it expresses
<PB N="251" REF="258"/>
any passion or temper, it is best explained by dis∣playing
that, and infusing it by sympathy into the
hearers.</P>
<P>The lectures which we have termed critical,
may be subdivided into two sorts; 1. Such as are
explications of a large portion of scripture. These
are now commonly called lectures. They are the
more necessary in our church, because they are
now the only thing we have in place of public
reading of the scriptures, which, in opposition to
our own directory, they have unhappily justled
out. In discourses of this sort, it was formerly
remarked to be proper, to explain a book regu∣larly
throughout. For every distinct lecture, a
distinct and complete paragraph or sense should be
chosen. It is always proper to add to the expli∣cation
of the verses, such practical reflections and
exhortations as naturally arise from them. These
ought not, in general, to be mixed with the ex∣plication,
because it would break the connection,
and keep the force of the whole from being per∣ceived.
It is better to subjoin them to the expli∣cation;
for thus it will best appear that they are
founded in the passage, and they can be prosecuted
together, and without interruption. It sometimes
happens, that one paragraph is too short for a
lecture, and that two or three can be compre∣hended
in it. Then, the reflections arising from
one of the paragraphs may be subjoined imme∣diately
to the explication of that paragraph, before
<PB N="252" REF="259"/>
proceeding to the explication of another. For,
such a discourse is, in reality, two or more distinct
lectures put together. 2. Such as are explications
of one verse or two, which contain some consider∣able
difficulties. These are lectures, according to
the definition we have given; for their design is
the explication of a part of scripture; and all the
rules which we have laid down, are as applicable
to them as to the former sort. An Exercise and
addition is a discourse of this sort, when it is pro∣perly
pursued; not spent in an useless grammatical
analysis of the words, but employed in a true cri∣tical
explication of them. Only it is plain, that
when such a discourse is brought to the pulpit, it
must not be filled with the words of the original
language. Making allowance for this circumstance,
many of Clarke's discourses are of this sort, and
very proper models for them. In a discourse of
this kind, the meaning of the words should be
first cleared up; then, the doctrine which they
truly contain, should be proposed and briefly il∣lustrated;
and then, the use and improvement of
that doctrine should be shortly pointed out. The
proper subject for such a discourse is a text, which
at once is difficult, and contains some important
and useful doctrine. Discourses of this sort will
naturally be interspersed with those of the former
kind; for in every book, one will now and then
meet with a difficult verse, which requires a parti∣cular
explication. And as, on the one hand, it is
contrary to the design of lecturing to spend more
<PB N="253" REF="260"/>
time than is necessary in explaining a clear passage;
so, on the other hand, it would be wrong, when
a difficult passage occurs, not to allow it the time
that is really necessary for explaining it.</P>
<P>Every part of scripture is intended either to
illustrate and enforce our duty, or to explain and
confirm some doctrine of religion; and as all the
doctrines of religion are subservient to practice,
and are proposed as motives to our duty, we may
justly say that every part of scripture is sit to in∣fluence
our practice. On this account practical
reflections are, as we have observed, an essential
part even of a critical lecture. But there are many
passages of scripture which are extremely plain in
themselves, and need very little explication: these
are the proper subjects for that species of lecturing
which we have termed practical. Some of the
rules of critical lectures, already laid down, are
likewise applicable to these: for instance, it is
necessary to observe the general design and scope
of the passage. Even in a plain passage, there are
generally some expressions that need to be ex∣plained.
These should be first of all explained,
according to the rules already mentioned. After
this, the practical observations which arise from
the passage, should be prosecuted. In prosecuting
them, two things are necessary; first, to show that
each observation is founded on the passage; and
next, to illustrate the observation itself, and apply
it to practice. There are many parts of scripture
<PB N="254" REF="261"/>
fit for such lectures. Thus many historical passages
are so easy, that very little is necessary for clearing
up the narration; and that little may often be best
done by giving the substance of the history in
modern language, and even with greater brevity
than it lies in the passage. After that is done, a
preacher should point out, with what view such a
passage of history is recorded, to what end we may
apply it, what lessons we may learn from it; and
in pointing out this, may very properly spend the
greatest part of the discourse. The parables of our
Saviour also are extremely proper subjects of prac∣tical
lectures. It is at least, in general, proper first
to explain the whole story or similitude in its literal
sense, so far as it needs to be explained, that thus
the whole import of it may be seen at once. This
literal explication of the verses will generally be
extremely short. But it is best to give it altogether;
it will afford an opportunity of showing the pro∣priety,
the beauty, and the real occasion of many
of the circumstances which are supposed or re∣lated;
it will likewise tend to prevent a fault which
is very common in explaining parables, but a fault
which ought to be carefully avoided; I mean, the
drawing a moral from every circumstance or inci∣dent
of the parable. This fault has in a great mea∣sure
arisen from giving the meaning and intention
of the parable as one proceeded, verse by verse,
which obliged him to contrive something designed
by every circumstance; though it is plain that
many circumstances are added, merely to render
<PB N="255" REF="262"/>
the literal story probable, or for ornament, but
have nothing answering to them in the moral.
And it were easy to give many instances of strange
mystical explications which have been devised from
some circumstances of our Saviour's parables. In
general, it is proper first of all to explain the
parable itself, as if it were a literal story, and had
no farther meaning, so far as it needs explication
in this way; and it is proper that this be a con∣tinued
explication, not interrupted by pointing out
the meaning of any part of it, at least in most
cases. After this is done, we must next explain
the real design and intention of the similitude, and
propose the instructions which it was designed to
convey. When these are proposed after the whole
explication, the same fault must be avoided which
we have already taken notice of. We are often,
especially young men, apt to be greatly pleased
with finding some mystical sense in every circum∣stance.
To allegorise them all has an appearance
of ingenuity, and therefore gratifies; but it is
always merely fanciful and uncertain, and there∣fore
should be avoided. It is always faulty to
refine in this manner, to found doctrines or to
squeeze maxims from every incident in a figurative
discourse. It is necessary to distinguish the cir∣cumstances
which are brought in merely to fill up
or adorn the narration, from those which are essen∣tial
to the parable. Attention to the occasion of
the parable, or to the run of the incidents, or to
the reflections made on it, will enable us to distin∣guish
<PB N="256" REF="263"/>
between these. We must draw the moral
only from the latter, and inculcate the instruction
which the parable was plainly designed to convey.
As all our Saviour's parables were originally
addressed to the Jews, most of them were designed
to convey some instruction, which their particular
circumstances rendered necessary. It is proper
always to take notice what this instruction was,
because the view of it adds greatly to the force
and beauty of the parable. Sometimes it will be
best to exhibit the whole import of the parable with
respect to the Jews together, and afterwards to
show what instruction it conveys to all Christians.
Sometimes again, when the instructions conveyed
by a parable are pretty much distinct, it will be
better to consider each instruction separately, as
directed first to the Jews, and then as applicable
to Christians. But still, whichever of these ways
be chosen, the principal part of a lecture on a
parable should be inculcating on the auditory the
instructions which it conveys. In prosecuting the
instructions that arise from a parable, it has always
a peculiar beauty, to introduce only such allusions,
similitudes, and illustrations, as have an analogy to
the circumstances of the parable. This prevents a
confusion of metaphors and figures: it makes the
whole appear to rise naturally from the parable:
it serves to inculcate the whole with the greater
force. You will find models of the manner of
explaining parables which we have recommended,
in Tillotson's discourses on the parable of the ten
<PB N="257" REF="264"/>
virgins, and the parable of the rich man and
Lazarus. I shall mention only one other subject
proper for this sort of lecture, which we have
termed practical, the book of Proverbs. Some of
the apothegms there need a critical explication; but
in explaining all of them, the principal thing to be
done is to represent the sentiment or maxim which
each contains, in a strong and striking light, so
that it may affect and touch the hearers. And as
they are all separate practical sayings, there is scarcely
any need of general reflections at the end of a
lecture on several of them.</P>
<P>A practical, as well as a critical lecture, may be
sometimes made on a single verse, or a small por∣tion
of scripture. A discourse on a single verse is
always properly a practical lecture, when it is not
a prosecution of some one subject, but is intended
to explain or enforce all the instructions which are
implied in the several members of the verse. Thus
every discourse, prosecuted in what is called the
textual method, is properly a lecture, either of the
critical or the practical fort, or often a mixture of
both. A sermon, as distinguished from these,
is the prosecution of some one subject, in some
or other of the ways that will be afterwards
explained.</P>
<P>2. Lectures are confined to an explication of
the scriptures; but there are other subjects which
it is necessary to explain. A second kind of expli∣catory
<PB N="258" REF="265"/>
discourses is such as are intended to open up
or illustrate a particular doctrine or duty of reli∣gion.
It is absolutely necessary that a doctrine be
understood, before it can be believed. It is abso∣lutely
necessary that a duty be understood, before
it can be practised. It is therefore proper that
discourses be often employed in explaining both.
A subject of this kind is either simple or complex;
a regard must be had to this distinction in explain∣ing
it.</P>
<P>Some simple subjects are at the same time so
easy and well known, that any explication of them
is unnecessary; it cannot make them plainer; and
in that case, it would be mere trifling. All our
natural passions, as joy, grief, love, hatred, are
known to every one by immediate feeling, and
cannot be made clearer by any verbal explication;
all that can be done is to refer the hearers to what
they feel. In discoursing on these passions, it may
indeed be necessary and proper to point out the
several views which the scripture gives of them,
the objects which it presents to them, the good
purposes which they answer, or the abuses to
which they are liable; but all this is different from
explaining the passion itself. When a simple subject
needs explication, or can be made clearer by it,
the explication may be performed by a definition
marking precisely what it is. The rules of defi∣nition
are given in logic, and have their foundation
in nature. 1. It should be short. 2. It should
<PB N="259" REF="266"/>
be perspicuous; and therefore both obscure and
metaphorical terms should be avoided in it. 3. It
should be exact, so that the definition may be sub∣stituted
for the name of the thing defined; it must
on the one hand exhaust the subject, and, on the
other hand, include nothing but what belongs to
it. A simple subject may be farther explained,
by distinguishing it from some other with which it
is naturally connected or nearly allied, and with
which it may therefore readily be confounded.
Thus kindness, meekness, and placability, are
virtues near a-kin, and yet really distinct. A per∣son
may have a very warm and affectionate dispo∣sition,
and yet not possess meekness, which is a
calmness in oppostion to anger, and not easily
ruffled even by great provocations; and a man
may possess this temper, and yet not be placable,
but unrelenting, when once provoked. Things
which have no natural connection often acquire an
artificial connection, or become so related in the
opinions of men, that they are as readily con∣founded
as if they had been naturally connected;
and consequently it is as necessary to distinguish
them. The power of education, custom, example,
the ignorance, the weakness, and the passions of
men, lead them to form many unjust associations;
and on no subject more frequently than on religion
and morality, where it is also most dangerous.
To break these associations, to separate things
which are totally distinct and yet often confounded,
is a point of great importance in discourses calcu∣lated
<PB N="260" REF="267"/>
for the religious improvement of mankind.
Thus religion is often confounded with super∣stition;
yet they are very different. Superstition
represents God as a capricious being, pleased with
insignificant ceremonies and abstinence from indif∣ferent
things, and severe on the neglect of them.
True religion must be carefully distinguished from
this; it is the very reverse; it consists in having
just conceptions of the divine nature and per∣fections,
in exercising such devout affections as
correspond to these, and in exerting them both in
external devotion and obedience to his will. Thus
zeal for truth and goodness, and virtuous indig∣nation
against vice, are often confounded with,
and therefore must be explained as perfectly distinct
from, a settled sourness or violence of temper, and
hatred of men's persons for difference in opinions
or ceremonies. In the imaginations of some,
pride, which consists in a high opinion of one's
own talents and endowments, and leads to resent
the sentiments of others concerning him, when
they fall below this standard, is connected and
confounded with greatness of mind, which is
totally different, which consists in a freedom from
all mean passions, little designs, and interested
views. On the other hand, humility is by some
confounded with littleness of soul and meanness of
spirit; but no two things are more different. Hu∣mility
arises from a just sense of our own imperfec∣tion,
of the narrowness of our understanding, of
the defects of our knowlege, of the weakness of
<PB N="261" REF="268"/>
our virtues; and it is never found except in those
who have conceived a high standard of perfection
and virtue, and who, from frequent self-reflection,
are conscious that they fall below it. But the
forming of such a high standard is so far from
having any tendency to produce meanness or little∣ness
of mind, that on the contrary, it has the
strongest tendency to wear it off, to exalt our
aims, to cherish whatever is great or worthy, and
to raise us gradually nearer to the standard which
we have conceived. Thus again, envy and emu∣lation
are often confounded, and must be distin∣guished;
the former is an uneasiness at the supe∣riority
of others, producing a desire that they may
be brought down to our level, or below it; the
latter is a noble ardour for attaining excellence,
leading us only to improve ourselves. A simple
subject may be explained, not only by a definition,
and by distinguishing it from others with which it
is apt to be confounded, but also by description.
A thing that cannot be defined, may notwithstand∣ing
be described; and after a subject has been de∣fined,
it may be illustrated. A subject may be
described or illustrated in many different ways.
Many things are very properly described by their
effects. The divine perfections cannot be con∣ceived
by us abstractly, as they exist in God; they
are conceived only by means of their effects, and
as showing themselves in these; and it is by pro∣perly
pointing out their effects in the works and
ways of God, that they can be explained. In ex∣plaining
<PB N="262" REF="269"/>
a thing by its effects, the most striking
and interesting of them should be selected; this
will render the explication animated and spirited.
Such principal and leading effects likewise should
be chosen, as include or suggest many particulars;
this will prevent tediousness of illustration, and
render it full in a consistence with brevity. In
particular, any virtue or vice cannot be more pro∣perly
explained, than by pointing out how it shows
itself in human life. This may be done by exam∣ples
taken from history, especially from the sacred
history; or it may be done by pointing out how it
shows itself in the different situations of life; for
instance, humility may be explained, by pointing
out how it will lead us to behave to those who are
our inferiors, our equals, or our superiors, in
knowlege, in religious improvement, in rank, in
age, or in character; this will give a full and the
most practical view of the subject. A simple sub∣ject
may be farther explained by comparison with
others nearly related to it, or in any respect analo∣gous
to it, but better known, or better defined.
A subject may likewise be illustrated by contrasting
it with its opposite; for opposites set by one an∣other,
mutually illustrate and throw light on each
other. Humility and pride, temperance and in∣temperance,
piety and impiety, when opposed in
their natures and their effects, on the persons
themselves or on others, will by this means be
better understood. It must be observed, that all
these methods of explication are not necessarily to
<PB N="263" REF="270"/>
be united on every subject; but a person's own
judgement must direct him, which of them is pro∣per
on each particular subject, as he has occasion
to treat it.</P>
<P>The second kind of subjects for explication is
complex, or such a subject as is made up of dif∣ferent
parts into which it may be distinguished.
In this case, whether a doctrine or a duty be the
subject to be explained, it is first of all necessary
for the explication, that the several parts or
branches of it be pointed out distinctly, and in a
natural order. Distinctness and order are necessary
in every kind of discourse; but they are above all
necessary here, where information is the ultimate
end. If the parts be confusedly jumbled together,
or if the subject be not distributed into its natural
and complete members, or if the several members
be not exhibited in their natural order and suc∣cession,
the discourse can convey only an imper∣fect,
or a confused idea of the doctrine or the duty.
The principal rules of a just division are three.
1. It should be complete; the several parts taken
together should exhaust the subject. For example,
if we should divide all practical religion into the
duties which we owe to God, and those which we
owe to our neighbour, the division would be faulty;
for there is a third class distinct from both these,
the duties which we owe to ourselves. 2. In a just
division, all the parts should be distinct and sepa∣rate,
so that no one of them be included in an∣other.
<PB N="264" REF="271"/>
3. The parts should succeed each other in
a natural order; the simplest and most fundamental
going before the others, and rising step by step
through these others. For example, in explaining
the love of God in the most extensive sense, to
find out the natural order of the parts, we may
reflect on what passes in our minds towards a
person whom we esteem and love, a person of high
abilities with whom we are connected by some
degree of dependence, and from whose favour we
expect some advantages. To such an one we will
feel, 1. High esteem of his talents and virtues;
2. A propensity to think often and to speak ho∣nourably
of them; 3. Desire of his happiness and
joy in it; 4. Desire of his approbation and plea∣sure
in possessing it; 5. Gratitude for his favours;
6. Confidence in him. This may be easily trans∣ferred
to God. If the first of these were placed
any where else, the division would be confused;
for esteem is the foundation of all the rest. When
the subject is thus properly divided into its parts,
each part should be prosecuted according to the
rules already mentioned for the explication of a
simple subject.</P>
<P>It were easy to produce many examples both of
a proper and improper order in explaining doctrines
or duties. But you will easily be convinced of the
necessity of the former, and of the inconveniences
of the latter, without our spending time in pro∣ducing
examples. The best means of leading you
<PB N="265" REF="272"/>
into a proper order in composing on any particular
subject, is a thorough understanding of that sub∣ject,
and of the dependence of its several parts.
This will enable you to throw them into that order,
in which they will reflect greatest light on one an∣other.
On some subjects, however, different or∣ders
in arranging the parts may be equally natural,
and each may have some advantages. For ex∣ample,
in explaining religion in general, as con∣sisting
of three kinds of duties, we may begin with
the duties to ourselves, which are simple and easily
comprehended; as self-government, or a due com∣mand
of our sensual appetites, so that they may
not lead us into gratifications prejudicial to our
health, vigour, reputation, or fortune; and of
anger, resentment, and other passions destructive
of the peace of our minds; attention to the im∣provement
of our rational powers, and the prose∣cution
of our most important, our spiritual and
eternal interest. Next, the duties which arise from
our connection with other men, with individuals,
with a family, or with larger societies. Next, the
duties incumbent on us as members of the media∣torial
kingdom of Christ. And lastly, those which
belong to us as creatures, as subjects of God's ra∣tional
kingdom. Or, we may observe the con∣trary
order, beginning with our duties to God,
and descending to the inferior duties. The former
gives the most easy view of the subject, as the first
steps are simple, and prepare the way for the com∣prehension
of the succeeding ones; the latter may
<PB N="266" REF="273"/>
give the completest view of each part, as founded
in the authority of God. The former would be
the proper order in instructing a person totally un∣acquainted
with the subject; for it would be im∣possible
to give him an idea of love, reverence,
and gratitude to God, without having first taught
him to observe the motions of his heart towards
men; the latter will, perhaps, give the most solid
and comprehensive view of the subject, to one who
has already a general acquaintance with it.</P>
<P>When I speak of distributing the subject to be
explained, into its natural members, I do not
mean to recommend a multiplicity of dry divisions
and subdivisions. This custom, unknown to the
ancient orators, and to all the Christian preachers
of the first ages, was introduced by the scholastics.
It often gives only a seeming order to the discourse,
but really mangles and breaks it; by following
it too much, a preacher does not, like a skilful
anatomist, separate his discourse into its proper
parts; but, like a butcher, cuts it out into a num∣ber
of pieces. A division is more necessary in an
explicatory sermon, than in any other. But even
here, a simple and natural division of the doctrine
or duty into its general parts is sufficient; and sub∣divisions
generally break the subject and clog the
memory. It is much better that without them
every part be placed in its natural situation. Both
in dividing and in prosecuting the explication of a
subject, all scholastic terms and method should be
<PB N="267" REF="274"/>
avoided. A preacher should not explain a doc∣trine
or duty, by the technical terms of metaphy∣sicians,
but as much as possible, in the language of
common sense, and in the words of scripture. He
should not divide it in the forced method of the
logical topics, but in the natural way that will
convey such a conception of it, as may tend to in∣fluence
practice.</P>
<P>The design of an explicatory discourse being to
inform the understanding, there can be in it no
direct or professed proofs of the truth of the doc∣trine,
or arguments for the duty, which is the
subject of it; the whole is designed for explication.
By considering, therefore, what is implied in ex∣plication,
or what is necessary for accomplishing it,
we may perceive the nature of an explicatory dis∣course.
Now, it is plain that every particular in∣cluded
in a doctrine or duty, must be clearly ex∣pressed,
and spread out as it were. It must like∣wise
be shown, that every particular introduced,
is really included in that doctrine or duty; and
that it arises from the preceding and is subservient
to the succeeding parts of it; and thus, reasoning
is introduced on the several particulars of a doc∣trine
or duty, even in an explicatory discourse,
though not on the truth of the general doctrine,
or obligation of the whole duty.</P>
<P>Explication, from its very nature, admits very
little of address to the imagination or the passions.
<PB N="268" REF="275"/>
But it does not exclude it altogether. Even in ex∣plaining
a doctrine, comparisons, metaphors, and
all other figures which serve for illustration, are
very naturally introduced. The explication of a
duty admits something more. It is the design of
an explicatory sermon, not so much to give a dry
analysis of a duty, which would enable a moralist
to comprehend distinctly all that it includes, as to
give a striking view of it in its whole extent, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to
influence the practice. It is its design, not so
much to inform persons of what they did not
know before, as to give them a lively sense of the
nature of a duty generally understood. In order
to answer this end, every thing that is said must
be addressed, though not to the passions, yet to the
feelings of mankind. This is what is properly
termed, sentiment; a notion or opinion set in such
a light as to touch the feelings, particularly any of
the internal or reflex senses of human nature.
Every thing that is said in explaining a duty should
be set in such a light as to touch the consciences
of the hearers, with a sense of its beauty, pro∣priety
or obligation. This can scarcely fail to hap∣pen,
if the sentiments themselves be just and true,
and be expressed by the preacher so as to show
that he feels them himself. For then the hearers
will, by sympathy with him, conceive them
strongly; and a strong conception of any duty
will always produce a perception of its obligation
or propriety.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="276"/>
3. There is likewise a third sort of explicatory
discourses, in which the subject to be explained is
a particular character. The two former kinds are
very common; this kind is more rare, but may
be sometimes used with great advantage. Butler's
sermon on the character of Balaam is an example
of it. Human characters are very complicated,
and frequently composed of very inconsistent prin∣ciples,
of which one actuates a person in some
parts of his conduct, and another in other parts;
and sometimes all of them influence him in some
degree, in the same action. Hence it becomes often
di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icult to form a just idea of a man's true cha∣racter.
Now the design of such a discourse as we
have mentioned is, to unravel a particular cha∣racter,
and point out the operation of the different
principles which are compounded in it. A cha∣racter
which is to be explained, ought always to
be that of some person who is described, or whose
history is recorded, in scripture: for otherwise, it
will not be so familiar, nor can be rendered so
familiar to the audience, as to make them enter
into it, or easily apprehend it. It is proper to give
a view of the history of the person whose character
we design to explain, so far as it can throw any
light upon his real character; for as it is from
actions that a character appears, so the history of
a person's actions is the only means by which we
can investigate his character, and the principles
by which he is actuated. With the history of a
person's particular actions must be joined an
<PB N="270" REF="277"/>
account of the principle and temper which each of
them discovers or proceeds from, and the state of
mind which they show a person to have been in at
the time of doing them. By this means the hearers
will be, assisted in forming a just, and at the same
time a lively conception of the several principles
which form the character. This will prepare the
way for representing, in an intelligible and striking
manner, the whole character at once, with all the
complication and opposition of principles which it
appears to contain. The picture of the most
remarkable features in a character should be
attended with such observations as may account for
it, and explain the combination of principles, and
the degree of influence which they have in the
conduct. When the character of a particular
person, described in scripture, is thus plainly repre∣sented
as showing itself in his particular circum∣stances,
the hearers will, of themselves, in some
measure, be able to discern how far it resembles
their own. But, in order to enable them the
better to discern it, and to render the description
more useful, it will be proper to represent the
character in a more general way, or rather to show
it in a variety of lights; to point out the different
forms which it assumes, the different ways in which
it influences the conduct, the different degrees in
which it betrays itself in common life. This will
bring it home to the hearers, and apply it directly
to their instruction.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="278"/>
Sermons of this sort will require a great know∣lege
of human nature; but if they be properly
executed, they may often be extremely useful.
By being employed about the character of an indi∣vidual,
they will give both a plain and a striking
view of what is the subject of them. By analysing
that character, either as it is maintained through
life, or as it is displayed in a particular action,
they will lay open some of the most secret windings
of the human heart, some of those turns of mind
and temper, which have the most extensive influ∣ence
upon the sentiments and practice of men.</P>
<P>There are many proper subjects for such discourses
to be found in holy writ; as, for example, the situa∣tion
of David's mind in the matter of Uriah, the
character of the proud pharisee in our Saviour's
parable, and in a word, all such passages as give
an opportunity of pointing out any combination of
principles, any contrast of passions, or any secret
and subtle workings of human nature, in the
person to whom they refer.</P>
<P>So much for those discourses which rest in expli∣cation
or instruction, and are addressed purely and
ultimately to the understanding. We shall con∣clude
with observing concerning all explicatory
discourses, that, as their ultimate end is inform∣ation
or instruction, so their prevailing character
ought to be perspicuity. It is only by this, that
their end can be promoted; and in order to
<PB N="272" REF="279"/>
obtain this, the sentiments must be just and natural,
disposed in a simple and regular order, set off with
apt and obvious illustrations, and expressed in
words plain and common in themselves, and, as
much as possible, familiar to the hearers. The
best way of attaining this perspicuity is to keep it
constantly in view, while we are composing, as our
principal aim, to be understood by the hearers.
This will prevent our aiming at an ostentation of
ingenuity and learning, and will make all our efforts
to centre in giving a clear view of the subject. In
order to this, the first requisite is, that we have
a clear idea of it ourselves. This requires both
a considerable exactness and extent of general
knowlege, and a careful preparation for every
particular subject.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="2">
<HEAD>ART. II. Of Convictive or Probatory Discourses.</HEAD>
<P>The second kind of pulpit discourse is that
which has for its end the proof of the truth of some
doctrine of religion. This may be called a con∣victive
or probatory discourse. It is addressed to
reason, or to those powers of the mind, by which
we perceive evidence, and distinguish truth from
falsehood. There are many of the truths of reli∣gion,
which all Christians believe; but it is often
proper to exhibit the proofs even of these: for
though men do not disbelieve them, a clear view
of their evidence will render their belief firmer:
though their belief be firm, yet a strong perception
<PB N="273" REF="280"/>
of their evidence will render its influence upon the
conduct greater. Thus the proofs of a God, of a
Providence, of a future judgment, are very proper
subjects of sermons to a christian audience, who
do not doubt of any of these doctrines. As the
design of preaching on them is, not so much to
convince men of what they do not believe, as to
strengthen the influence of a belief which they have
already, a preacher is not confined altogether to
the abstract and cool method of argumentation, but
may very allowably throw in whatever tends to
make the force of the argument better felt, or to
render it fitter to touch the heart. In such ser∣mons,
therefore, a degree of ornament may be
admitted, which would be very unsuitable to a
philosophical examination of the evidence of prin∣ciples.
Were a metaphysician, for example, to
produce a proof of the being of God, he would
satisfy himself with giving a plain and conclusive
argument for it; but a preacher should set that
argument in a more popular light, exhibiting it in
such a way that it may produce a sense of the
divine existence, fit to remain with men, and to
influence them in life. In order to this, he must
turn every part of it into sentiment; he must show
that he has himself a strong conviction of it, which
may infect them with the same by sympathy; he
must not urge the argument in general, but must
in every part of it give a view of some particular
existence, and a lively picture of the impressions
of the creator which it bears; the same proof
<PB N="274" REF="281"/>
which he represents so as fully to convince the
understanding, he must make to strike the imagin∣ation,
and to touch the heart. Whatever be the
truth proposed to be proved, the christian orator
will find means of setting the proofs of it in this
striking light. It would be absurd to attempt a
formal proof that all men are mortal; yet it is very
necessary to insist on the certainty of death, to
give men a striking sense of it, and to detect those
causes which make it have so little influence on the
generality.</P>
<P>Even in the most abstract reasoning, it is wrong
to flay to obviate every tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling objection that may
be formed against the reasoning. It retards the
progress, breaks the argument, and distracts the
attention. But it is still more improper, when the
design of a sermon is to strengthen men's conviction
of a truth which they believed before, and to
render that conviction fitter for influencing prac∣tice.
In this case, to introduce every objection,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to answer it, must perfectly chill the
argument, must wholly interrupt the course of the
thought, and render it unfit to operate either on
the imagination or the passions. Besides, as a
great part of mankind are incapable of balancing
evidence, or of weighing objections and answers
against each other, and perceiving the preponde∣rance
of evidence, the multiplying of objections
in preaching will tend much more to perplex or
raise doubts, than to remove them and strengthen
<PB N="275" REF="282"/>
conviction. They should therefore be very spa∣ringly
introduced in such probatory discourses as
are intended to give men a strong conviction or a
lively sense of truths which they already believe.
And by far the greatest part of probatory discourses
from the pulpit ought to be of this kind. The
doctrines which a preacher ought certainly to treat
most frequently, are the great and important truths
of natural and revealed religion. These are uni∣versally
believed by those to whom he has occasion
to preach. The greatest part even of the contro∣versies
that have been raised about these, among
the di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>erent sects of Christians, has regarded the
manner of explaining them, rather than the
truth of the doctrines themselves. Yet it is neces∣sary
to remind men of the evidences of these doc∣trines,
otherwise their assent to them will be very
weak. But it is proper to handle them in the
popular, sentimental, and striking manner, which
we have pointed out, not in the accurate, dry
method of ratiocination, which would be proper
for the conviction of a person who disbelieved
them.</P>
<P>But though this be the kind of probatory dis∣courses
for which a preacher will have most frequent
occasion; yet it may sometimes be necessary to
prove doctrines which are really denied by some of
his hearers. When doctrines of real importance are
denied, or doctrines truly pernicious and of a bad ten∣dency
in life are propagated, it becomes a very proper
<PB N="276" REF="283"/>
end of preaching, to prove the former, and to
con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute the latter. There will be need for dis∣courses
of this sort much more frequently in some
congregations than in others; and different situa∣tions
will point out different subjects as fit to be
handled in this way. But whatever be the situation
in which a minister be placed, he should be careful
to preach in this way no more than is absolutely
necessary; for to dwell on the dry eviction of
mere speculative and controverted points, tends to
draw men too much off from practice, to lead
them to place religion in speculation, and to render
them fond of questions and fruitless disputes.</P>
<P>In such discourses two different methods may be
used; the analytical, and synthetical. In the
former, the point to be proved is not explicitly
proposed, but the principles from which it is
deducible are laid down and pursued through their
several consequences, till at last the point in view
appears to be evidently deducible from them.
This method is not very common in sermons, and
is indeed difficult; but it is very proper when the
hearers are prejudiced, and leads them on, without
suspicion, from one acknowleged truth to another,
till at last the conclusion breaks in unexpectedly
upon them. In the synthetical method, which is
the most common, a proposition is explicitly laid
down, and the arguments for it professedly urged.
This kind likewise admits two different methods,
answering to the two kinds of demonstration in
<PB N="277" REF="284"/>
mathematical subjects, the direct, and the indirect.
In the former, the preacher confirms the truth, by
proposing the arguments for it in their natural
order, by which they add greatest weight to one
another, He should propose them in that point
of view, in which they are least liable to the ex∣ceptions
which are made against them. When
they cannot be set in such a light as to be evi∣dently
not exposed to these exceptions, he must
take notice of such exceptions as are most material,
and show that they are invalid, and that the argu∣ment
against which they seem to lie, is conclusive
notwithstanding them.</P>
<P>Sometimes again, a probatory discourse may
proceed in the indirect method of reasoning.
This will be the case, when the preacher's aim is
chiefly to confute error. Sometimes a false opi∣nion
is advanced, and by merely showing that the
arguments produced for it are really inconclusive,
the opposite truth will be sufficiently supported.
Sometimes a truth is not directly denied; but it is
thought to be attended with such difficulties, or
liable to such objections, as weaken men's con∣viction
of it, and make them doubtful or sceptical
about it. In either of these cases, the most natu∣ral
way of producing a conviction of the truth, is
to proceed in the indirect way; to propose the
several arguments by which the false opinion is
supported, to show that they are not sufficient to
prove it, that notwithstanding them, men may re∣main
<PB N="278" REF="285"/>
convinced of the opposite truth. It will thus
depend on the nature of the truth that is denied,
on the manner in which it is denied, and on the
particular disposition of the hearers, whether it
will be most effectually supported by reasoning in
the direct and ostensive, or in the indirect and apo∣gogical
method. To these circumstances the
preacher should attend, and by them he should be
directed to the one method or the other; always
taking care to choose what will be most effectual
in the particular case.</P>
<P>In mathematical subjects, either of the kinds of
demonstration is sufficient of itself; if either be
used, it would be superfluous to add another of
the same kind, or to subjoin a demonstration of
the other kind. But religious and moral subjects
are widely different. Their evidence generally not
only arises from several arguments joined together,
but also, there are at least appearances of argu∣ment
against them. On this account, in most
subjects of preaching, both the methods of eviction
that have been mentioned, may be very properly
united in probatory discourses from the pulpit.
When the discourse proceeds chiefly in direct con∣firmation
of the truth, by proposing the several
arguments that support it, it is highly proper, not
only to remove the exceptions brought to weaken
the several arguments, which will be best done in
prosecuting the particular argument against which
they are pointed; but also, after all the arguments
<PB N="279" REF="286"/>
have been prosecuted in this manner, it will be
very fit for the farther confirmation of the truth,
to answer the arguments which are produced on
the other side, and to show either that they have
no real force, or that they have not force enough
to counterbalance the arguments which have been
proposed before. In like manner, when the dis∣course
has proceeded chiefly in the indirect way;
after having insisted on all the arguments for the
false opinion, and shown them to be inconclusive,
it will add great weight to the reasoning to show
next, that not only is there no solid argument for
it, but that there are also strong arguments against
it; that not only is there no valid objection against
the truth, but also the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strongest evidences for it.
Hence, every probatory discourse, intended to
evince a truth disbelieved or doubted by the hear∣ers,
will properly proceed both by confirmation
and confutation; and the kinds of such discourses
will be distinguished chiefly by the order in which
these succeed each other.</P>
<P>Thus probatory discourses are of two kinds;
such as are designed to produce a sense of truths
already believed, and such as are designed to be∣get
belief of truths formerly denied or doubted;
and the latter hold chiefly either of confirmation
or of confutation. We may reduce to this head
a third sort of discourses; such as are employed
in investigation, or in tracing out the causes of
things; as, Why Christianity has not, in fact, a
<PB N="280" REF="287"/>
greater influence on the reformation of mankind;
Why men are so apt to place religion in externals;
and the like. For though such discourses are not
employed in proving a particular proposition by
arguments, they consist principally of reasoning,
in order to convince men that the causes assigned
do really produce the effects taken notice of. But
as the end of all these sorts is the same, conviction,
so there are many rules common to them all, re∣sulting
from this their common end. These are,
in general, the rules of right reasoning, which
ought to be delivered fully in that part of philoso∣phy
which professes to teach the art of reasoning.
We cannot here enlarge upon them all; but shall
only hint at a few of the most considerable of
them.</P>
<P>It is necessary to attend, whether the point to be
proved is simple or complex; if it be complex,
its several parts must be kept in view, and the
arguments supporting them, according to their
natural order, be regularly proposed. The argu∣ments
which prove only one part of the proposi∣tion,
must be carefully separated from those which
prove the whole, and reduced to different classes.
If those which directly prove the several parts▪ of
the proposition, be first urged according to the
natural order of these parts; such arguments as
confirm the whole, will, by coming after them, be
well understood, and will, as it were, collect into
a point, and concentrate the conviction produced
<PB N="281" REF="288"/>
by them. In other cases, it may have a good
effect to begin with the general arguments, and
then, such as particularly prove the several parts,
will spread out and illuminate the conviction pro∣duced
by the former. If the general truth to be
proved is pretty well understood in the gross, and
the general arguments for it are very plain, this
latter is perhaps preferable; if that truth be but
indistinctly or imperfectly conceived by the hear∣ers,
or if the general arguments for it be complex,
the former manner will be most eligible.</P>
<P>In order to reason well on any subject, it is first
of all necessary, that a man know what kind of
proof or evidence that subject admits of; other∣wise,
he will be in danger of falling into a wrong
track, and of searching out improper arguments.
On this account, that part of logic which distin∣guishes
evidence with accuracy into its different
kinds, and ascertains the proper province of each
kind, is of the greatest importance, and is indeed
a proper preparation for reasoning of every sort.
Now, all the subjects, of which a preacher has oc∣casion
to attempt the proof, are reducible to two
kinds; such as are to be proved by reason, and
such as are to be proved by revelation. He should
content himself with whichever of these kinds the
present subject admits of; for to apply them in∣discriminately
to all subjects, would be perfectly
absurd. In proving a truth discoverable by rea∣son,
<PB N="282" REF="289"/>
he must consider what is the peculiar kind of
proof suited to that truth, and exhibit it. In
proving a truth by revelation, care must be taken
to argue, not from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, but the real mean∣ing.
It is proper to show that the expressions in
a text, which seem to imply a proof of it, have
that sense which renders them a proof of it in
other texts; and that they art determined to this
sense by the context and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of writing in that
particular text. When a truth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a proper
proof only from reason, yet that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or some
steps of it, may very well be expressed in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ords
of scripture. When a truth is to be proved only
by revelation, it may yet be very properly illus∣trated
from suppositions of reason. Some truths
may be proved both by reason and revelation;
then, each part of the proof should be prosecuted
according to its peculiar rules. In proving from
reason, all abstruse, far-fetched, and complex argu∣ments
should be avoided, for they will be neither
intelligible nor convincing. In proving from scrip∣ture,
only plain texts and fully to the purpose
should be used; obscure texts would need long
explication before they could be applied, and am∣biguous
ones will promote doubt, instead of dis∣pelling
it. In proving from either, only such ar∣guments
should be used as are truly conclusive;
a few of these will be sufficient to produce con∣viction;
but a weak argument always debilitates
the stronger ones. Every argument, from what∣ever
<PB N="283" REF="290"/>
source it be derived, should be exhibited as
shortly as can be, without detracting from its
force; for thus its whole force will be best repre∣sented
at once. Care should likewise be taken
not to urge too great a multiplicity of arguments,
for this would only confound the judgement and
burden the memory. It is much better to make
a selection of those which will be most easily com∣prehended,
and are most undoubtedly conclusive;
these will be sufficient to produce conviction, and
more would rather tire, than strengthen the con∣viction.
In other cases, it may be proper to dis∣tribute
the arguments into different classes, which,
like a projection in architecture, will take off from
the ill effect of the number, and enable the mind
to comprehend them without difficulty or disgust.
All the doctrines of true religion are of a practical
nature, and ought to be always represented as
subservient to practice. Even in a discourse there∣fore,
intended mainly for proving a doctrine, its
influence on practice ought to be pointed out.
When the discourse is of the first kind, designed
to produce a strong sense of a doctrine already
believed, it has been formerly observed, that the
whole argument should be carried on in such a
way as to touch the heart. But besides this, every
probatory discourse should conclude with pointing
out its influence on practice. Sometimes this may
be done, by enforcing from it some one virtue to
which it is principally subservient. Sometimes,
when the doctrine proved, enforces equally se∣veral
<PB N="284" REF="291"/>
duties, the obligation which it lays us under
to all these, may be pointed out in distinct infer∣ences
or deductions.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="3">
<HEAD>ART. III. Of Panegyrical or Demonstrative Discourses.</HEAD>
<P>THE third sort of discourses are such as are ad∣dressed
to the imagination, and are intended to
raise admiration. A preacher may, without de∣viating
from the end of his vocation, endeavour to
enrapture his audience with this pleasure. The
reason is, that admiration tends naturally and im∣mediately
to produce imitation, and to excite noble
ambition and emulation. The preacher seems to
aim only at making a character admired; he em∣ploys
all the means which can promote this end;
but he seeks the admiration of his hearers only for
the sake of its necessary consequences; yet as no∣thing
farther is requisite for securing these, but
exciting admiration, this may justly be considered
as the distinguishing aim of such discourses.</P>
<P>The ancient Rhetoricians take notice of this
species of discourses, and call them Panegyrical or
Demonstrative. They allow two sorts of them;
one employed in praising, another in blaming.
Christian charity scarcely allows one of the latter
sort to be brought to the pulpit; it seems to forbid
making it the whole purpose of a discourse, to de∣scribe
and exaggerate, as it were, all the vices of
one particular person, It is more suitable, to re∣present,
<PB N="285" REF="292"/>
in the fairest point of view, eminent virtue
and goodness. There are many subjects on which
such discourses may be properly composed by a
Protestant preacher; as the life of our Saviour,
and the lives of those holy men whose history is
recorded in scripture. We are expressly com∣manded
to follow these examples; and therefore
it must be highly proper to propose their examples
to a christian audience.</P>
<P>A demonstrative discourse bears some analogy
to the last kind of explicatory discourse which was
explained, as a character is the subject of both.
But they are considerably different. The design
of the one is from the actions to deduce a distinct
analysis of the character; the design of the other
is to represent the character and the actions in such
a light as may most effectually promote imitation.
The true way of doing this is to paint the whole
man, and to set him before the hearer's eyes,
speaking and acting. In describing the course of
his life, the preacher should chiefly point out those
passages in which his virtues best appeared. He
should recount his laudable actions: this gives
force to a panegyric; this is what instructs people,
and makes an impression on their minds. This is
to paint a person to the life, and shows what he was
in every period, in every condition, and in the
most remarkable junctures of his life. At the
same time, a demonstrative discourse should not be
a simple narration. It is enough to select the
<PB N="286" REF="293"/>
chief facts, and represent them in a concise, lively,
and striking manner. There should be the same
difference between a mere history and a discourse
of this kind, as between a natural history of an
animal and a poetical description of it. The
former describes minutely every particular regard∣ing
it; the latter chooses a few of the most remark∣able
particulars, and, by combining them, ex∣hibits
a pleasing and striking picture of the object
to the imagination. It is never allowable to exceed
the bounds of truth; but the end of this discourse
requires that the virtues of a person should be set in
the most amiable and engaging light that truth will
permit; and that the faults which were blended
with these virtues should be either wholly omitted,
or touched as slightly as possible. This is evidently
the way to excite admiration, and to promote
imitation; and it is plainly allowable, because the
preacher's professed design is, not to give a history
of the person, but to exhibit his example so far as
it is worthy of imitation. This sort of discourse
should never be allowed to run into the florid;
but it may approach nearer to it, and be more
adorned with bold figures, than any other sort of
sermon. A good deal of this is really necessary
for attaining its end.</P>
<P>Demonstrative discourses may be distinguished
into three kinds. The subject of the first is a
person's whole life. Such a discourse as this will
exhibit a lively picture of all the virtues which a
<PB N="287" REF="294"/>
person has exercised, in all the different periods,
and in all the various situations and emergencies of
life. The subject of the second kind is one period
of a holy man's life; it may exhibit all the virtues
which he exercised, in all the different situations in
which he was placed during that period. Thus a
discourse may be employed in exhibiting Joseph's
example before his advancement to the govern∣ment
of Egypt; or in displaying his example after
his advancement The life of Paul after his con∣version
is another instance of this kind of discourse.
The third species is that which has for its subject a
particular virtue, as displayed in various circum∣stances
through the whole of a man's life; as the
patience of Job, the faith of Abraham. These
three kinds of demonstrative sermons di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer only
in the extent of their subject; their end and
general rules are almost wholly the same; they
can scarce differ in any other respect than the
division of which they are susceptible. The first
kind, which takes in a whole life, may be prose∣cuted
in two different methods. 1. The life may
be divided into its different periods, and the virtues
displayed in each period exhibited to the view of
the hearers. By this means, each member will
become a discourse of the second species. 2. It
may be divided according to the different virtues
which appear in it; and the discourse may show
how each-virtue separately has been exercised and
displayed through all the different periods and
situations in which the person has been placed.
<PB N="288" REF="295"/>
In this way, the example of Christ is represented
in <HI>The Life of God in the Soul of Man,</HI> as redu∣cible
to piety, charity, purity, and humility; and
the prosecution of this subject, in the first part of
that book, is not a bad example of a discourse of
this kind. This sort of division has some advan∣tages,
especially when a person's situation has not
undergone very great changes. The only incon∣venience
that attends it is, that sometimes different
virtues are complicated in the same action; but
this is not of great consequence, for that action
may be introduced under that virtue which is
predominant in it; and all the other virtues which
likewise appeared in it, may be at the same time
pointed out without any breach of method. And
to compensate this, one has an opportunity, by
pursuing this method, to exhibit every virtue of
the person's life entire, and in all the different
points of light in which the person had, through
his whole life, occasion to exert it. When this
method is pursued, every part of the discourse
becomes a demonstrative discourse of the last sort.
In this species sometimes, but often in the two last,
no division is absolutely necessary; it is enough
that the several actions of a person be represented
in a natural order. In the second species, where
the subject is some period of a life, if the preacher
choose a division, it may most naturally be made
according to the different virtues which a person
has had occasion to show in that period. In the
third species again, where one particular virtue is
<PB N="289" REF="296"/>
the subject, the division may be according to the
different periods or situations in which that virtue
has been exercised. There are many sermons
extant, which are in some measure of the demon∣strative
kind; as all those on the example of
Christ. But few or none of them are prosecuted
according to the accurate rules of such compo∣sitions.</P>
<P>In a word, it is the design of a demonstrative
or panegyrical sermon, at once to give a distinct
knowlege, and to excite high admiration of the
virtues of a particular person, with a view to
promote the imitation of them, by giving a lively
view of these virtues as displayed in a series of
actions.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="4">
<HEAD>ART. IV. Of Suasory Discourses.</HEAD>
<P>The last kind of pulpit discourse is addressed to
the passions and the will; its end is persuasion;
we may therefore call it the suasory. This is of
all the most complex kind; it includes all the rest,
or at least it presupposes instruction, conviction,
and pleasing, and superadds something to them
which is peculiar to itself, and constitutes its
distinguishing criterion. A suasory discourse is
intended to persuade men to a certain course; and
in order to answer its end, it must discover what
that course is; it must prove that it is subservient
to some end acknowleged to be of importance by
the hearers; and that end must be so represented
<PB N="290" REF="297"/>
to the imagination, that it may excite a strong
affection to it, by means of which the will may be
determined to the course which leads to it.</P>
<P>In order to persuade a man to any course, the
understanding must be addressed so far, as to let
him both know what the course is that you want
him to pursue, and to convince him that his pur∣suing
that course will answer some good end. It
is possible indeed to move men, without enlighten∣ing
them; but this emotion is a mere temporary
passion, which neither has any fixed direction, nor
can answer any purpose. If you would move a
man with any thing beyond such a transient emo∣tion,
if you would truly persuade him, you must
enlighten as well as move. You must not only let
him know what is the course which you would
have him to take, but also show the reason why he
should take it. In every suasory discourse, there∣fore,
there must be reasoning or argument used,
in order to convince the hearers that they ought
to do what you recommend to them; and till they
be thus convinced, it is impossible that they can do
it. A reasonable being always proposes some end,
and it is for some end that he does every action,
and either indulges or curbs any disposition. The
reasoning, therefore, which can contribute to
persuade men to any action or any course, is of
that particular kind which shows that action or
course to be conducive to a certain end or purpose.
To persuade men to holiness and virtue, one may,
<PB N="291" REF="298"/>
for instance, prove that it is conducive to peace of
mind, to present interest, or to future happiness.
This can be proved only by reasoning or argument.
If the arguments produced do not convince men
that holiness is necessary for these ends, they can
have no tendency to persuade them; however
much they may desire the ends, and however
willing they may be to pursue them, yet they will
not be prevailed on to pursue them in this way,
except they be convinced that this way leads to
the attainment of them, and is necessary for
it. Thus the judgement must be convinced by
proper arguments, before men can be excited
to any action. Solid reasoning is therefore one
essential ingredient in that eloquence which tends
to persuasion. But this is not alone sufficient for
persuasion.</P>
<P>It is likewise necessary to render the hearers
fond of the end, to which the course recommended
is represented as subservient. Though a man be
ever so much convinced that a certain action will
redound to his honour, for instance, yet he will
never think of doing that action, if he has no
desire of honour. To understand, therefore, what
more than mere reasoning is necessary to persuasion,
we need only consider, what principles of the mind
they are that attach men to the ends which they
pursue. They are, in general, the affections and
practical principles of human nature. Conscience
renders the doing our duty, and obtaining the
<PB N="292" REF="299"/>
approbation of our own minds, a desirable end to
us. Self-love makes us fond of happiness, and
ready to do what is necessary for obtaining it.
Ambition attaches us to honour. Gratitude dis∣poses
us to what will be agreeable to a benefactor;
benevolence, to what will tend to the happiness of
others; and so in other cases. Now, to persuade
to a certain course, we must excite those affections
or principles, which attach men to those ends
from which our topics of argument are deduced.
Would we, for example, persuade men to holiness,
from its necessity in order to obtain the heavenly
happiness, we must not only prove that it is neces∣sary
for this, but also render them desirous of the
heavenly happiness. Would we excite them to
virtue, from gratitude to God our benefactor, who
requires it, we must not only prove that it is the
properest expression of gratitude, but also we must
excite in them a disposition to be grateful. But as
it is thus necessary to excite the passions, as well as
to convince the judgment, so the former will not
be sufficient alone without the latter. Let any
passion be ever so strong in a man's mind, it will
not lead him to any particular course, except he
be convinced that that course tends to gratify it.
You may raise in a man the strongest desire of
heaven; but this desire will not incline him to
practise holiness, till you have likewise convinced
him that holiness is the way to heaven. Thus
neither argument alone, nor moving the passions
alone, is sufficient. The cool reasoner, who con∣fines
<PB N="293" REF="300"/>
himself to the former, may convince men
that certain actions are necessary to certain ends;
but he does not excite their desire of these ends.
The warm preacher, who has no solid argument,
may raise a violent emotion, a present desire of a
certain end; but he does not point out the means
by which it may be attained; or, if he mention
them, he does not sufficiently evince their ne∣cessity;
and therefore, the emotion which he raised
has no fixed direction, but evaporates without de∣termining
men to any settled course. The latter
warms without enlightening; the former enlightens
without warming. Both perform but half the bu∣siness
of persuasion. To complete it, the judge∣ment
must be convinced and the passions raised at
one and the same time. When this is done, the
will is immediately determined to resolve on the
course, and to perform the action recommended.
Affection makes us desirous of the end; reason
shows us that we must do certain actions for ob∣taining
it; and as soon as this is perceived, affection
urges us to will the doing of that action; and when
we are brought to will it, persuasion is accom∣plished,
and we immediately do the action. A
suasory discourse is, therefore, directly addressed
to the will; its design is to seize and captivate the
will, and lead it to exert itself in an effectual vo∣lition
of the course recommended. And this is
attained by convincing the hearers that that course
is necessary for a certain end, and raising, at the
same time, a strong affection to that end. The
<PB N="294" REF="301"/>
preacher who can frame his discourse so as to pro∣duce
these two effects at once, will be a master of
persuasion, and attain that vehemence which is
the noblest species of eloquence, its very summit
and perfection.</P>
<P>We have already observed, how one of the parts
of persuasion is to be performed; the judgement
is to be convinced by solid reasoning. It will now
be necessary to show how the passions may be
raised; for in raising them, the other part of per∣suasion
consists. Now, there are only two ways
by which any passion or affection can be produced;
either by giving an actual perception of the object
of that passion, or by presenting a lively idea of
that object. The actual presence of the object of
a passion never fails to excite the passion; the
feeling of pain produces sorrow; the sight of dis∣tress
raises our sympathy. But it is seldom that a
preacher can present the objects themselves to his
hearers; if their affections could be raised only by
the actual presence of their objects, it would be out
of his power to raise them in most cases. But God
has wisely constituted us in such a way, that the
several passions and affections of our nature may
be likewise raised by strong and lively ideas of
their objects. Thus, the certainty of a very great
calamity will raise sorrow, before we actually en∣dure
it; a description of deep distress will excite
our compassion to the person who suffers it; merely
thinking of a favour will raise gratitude to the au∣thor
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
of it. It is by this way that the preacher has
access to the hearts of his hearers; he can raise
their passions only by presenting to them strong
and lively ideas of the objects of them. As it is
the imagination of the hearers that conceives these
lively ideas, so it is by addressing himself to their
imagination, that the preacher presents these ideas
to them. All the passions take their rise from the
imagination, and it is by first touching the ima∣gination,
that we must, by means of it, move the
passions. In order therefore to explain how the
passions are raised, it will be necessary to consider
how the imagination is addressed, and what kind
of address to it has an influence on the passions.</P>
<P>Now, every description which tends to please
any of our internal or reflex senses, is addressed to
the imagination; whatever is new, beautiful, ele∣gant,
harmonious, or sublime, gratifies the ima∣gination;
and every description of such objects is
addressed to it. Every such description is admitted
into poetry, which rests in gratifying the imagin∣ation,
and whose end is to please. But there are
some objects which, however much a lively de∣scription
of them may gratify the imagination, have
no tendency to influence the passions, because they
are not the cause or the object of any passion.
Such descriptions therefore cannot enter into sua∣sory
discourses; they have no tendency to promote
the end of them; they would rather obstruct it, by
fixing the mind upon something else.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="303"/>
Again, some descriptions even of those things
which are the natural objects and causes of our
passions, are unfit to excite them. If they be so
florid and gaudy as to amuse or dazzle the mind,
it will rest in the amusement which they give,
without feeling, any disposition to be actuated by
the passion which these objects might have raised.
The description may be very beautiful in itself,
but it does not suit its place, nor contribute to the
end to which it ought to have been subordinate.
The descriptions then which, in a suasory discourse,
are addressed to the imagination, must be so con∣trived
as to set those objects and causes of our
passions, of which they are descriptions, in that
point of view in which they have the strongest
tendency to excite the passions. In order to this,
the passions themselves, with their objects and
effects, must be well painted. The most striking
circumstances of the objects and effects must be
represented in so lively a manner, that the hearer
may almost fancy that he sees them. The work∣ings
of the passion must be represented so naturally,
as to make them think that they see one actuated
by it, and as may turn the lively idea of it which
they form, into the passion itself. Metaphors,
similitudes, images, abrupt and strong expressions,
rightly chosen and applied, and, in a word, many
of the figures of eloquence, are subservient to this.
Till a strong idea of the object, effects and work∣ings
of the passion, be in this way imprinted on the
imagination, the preacher's discourse cannot excite
<PB N="297" REF="304"/>
the passions of the hearers. But, if he can con∣vey
such a strong idea, the passion will immediately
rise spontaneously and without more ado.</P>
<P>Thus we have endeavoured to analyse persuasion,
to show all that it includes, and all that is necessary
for accomplishing it. Persuasion always tends to
some action or course of action; it operates ulti∣mately
on the will, which is the immediate cause
of action; but in order to determine the will, it
must previously convince the judgement, strike the
imagination, and move the passions. A preacher
would persuade men to a certain conduct; in order
to do this, he must convince them by argument and
reasoning, that that conduct tends to some valuable
end; he must likewise bring them to perceive and
feel that that end is really valuable, by painting it
in lively colours: this picture will of course raise
the passion or affection which attaches to this end;
and an affection for the end immediately determines
the will to pursue that course which was shown by
reasoning to be necessary for the attainment of the
end. All this is requisite; if any step of it be
wanting, persuasion cannot be accomplished: the
discourse may answer other ends, but it cannot
answer this particular end, persuasion. If it con∣tain
only argument, it will convince; if it contain
only gaudy painting of objects unconnected with
the passions, it will please; if it contain only proper
pictures of the objects, effects and workings of the
passions, but without a mixture of reasoning, it
<PB N="298" REF="305"/>
will be pathetic, it will move the passions. But
in all these cases it falls short of persuasion. To
accomplish this, argument, painting, and the pa∣thetic,
must be combined.</P>
<P>It was necessary, for the sake of distinctness, to
consider these parts of persuasion separately. But
we must not imagine that they are to be kept per∣fectly
separate in a suasory discourse. We are not
first to prove by cool reasoning, that a course tends
to a certain end, and then with warmth to raise an
affection to that end; nor are we first to raise a
strong passion for the end, and then when we have
possessed the hearers with it, to convince them by
cool reasoning that, if they would gratify that
passion and obtain the end, they must take the
course which we recommend. If we were to keep
the two parts of persuasion, argument, and the
pathetic, in which last painting is evidently implied,
thus entirely distinct and separate, the effect of the
one must be lost and wear wholly off, before we
came to the other; each would be weakened by
their divorce; and the two parts of the discourse
would appear unlike and unsuitable to each other.
The argument and the pathetic must be in some
degree interwoven and incorporated together
through the whole discourse. It is not indeed
necessary that they should prevail equally in every
part of it; sometimes the one, sometimes the other
will preponderate; generally, argument should
prevail in the former part, and the pathetic in the
<PB N="299" REF="306"/>
latter, though this does not hold without exception.
But whichever prevails, there must, through the
whole, be a mixture of the other. The argument
must not be pursued in the same unaffecting way,
as if it were intended only for conviction, but
must be intermixed all along with such lively and
pathetic descriptions as may gently touch the
passions, and prepare them for rising, when they
come to be more professedly addressed. The rea∣soning
which evinces that the course recommended
tends to a valuable end, must be so contrived as,
at the same time, to raise some degree of affection
to that end. In like manner, that part of the dis∣course
which is intended chiefly to raise the passions,
must be so contrived as to preserve all along the
conviction arising from the argument. The co∣lours
by which the end is rendered affecting, must
be intermixed with such hints of the argument, as
may keep in view that course by which the passion
raised by the end may be gratified. A preacher
who would persuade, must thus address at one and
the same time all the powers of human nature, the
understanding, the imagination, and the passions.</P>
<P>It is evident from what has been said, that an
address to the passions is necessary in a discourse
whose end is persuasion. But if a discourse con∣tained
only an address to the passions, its end would
be properly, not persuasion, but moving. And
it was observed before, that merely to move, is not
a proper aim in a discourse from the pulpit, except
<PB N="300" REF="307"/>
in some very particular cases. But as it is allow∣able
in some cases, it will be proper just to remark
what it is that forms the moving, as distinguished
from the vehement or persuasive. This latter re∣sults
from the union of reasoning with painting.
Now, if the former of these ingredients be re∣moved,
if the discourse contain only moving pic∣tures
of the object of any passion, without any
reasoning concerning the way of exerting that
passion, it will produce the pure pathetic; a certain
passion or affection will be raised by it, but the
mind will not be determined by that discourse to
exert the passion in any particular way. Again;
all our passions do not lead equally to action;
some of them lead to it very directly, as desire,
aversion, benevolence, anger; some seem to lead
rather to inaction, or at least lead very faintly to
action, as joy, sorrow, &amp;c. If a discourse tend
chiefly to raise those of the latter kind, it will be
properly pathetic; accordingly, this term is very
commonly restricted to such compositions as tend
to produce sorrow.</P>
<P>It is, I know, an opinion entertained by some,
that a preacher ought not to address himself at all
to the passions of his hearers, but only to their
reason. It is alleged, that to move their passions;
is to put a bias upon their judgement, to mislead
them, and to raise an emotion which will be tran∣sient,
and wear off without leaving any good effect.
But this opinion can proceed only from want of
<PB N="301" REF="308"/>
attention, or from very superficial reflection. In
matters of mere speculation, it is indeed wrong to
work upon men's passions; but wherever action
is concerned, the coolest speaker addresses the
passions of men; and indeed, unless he speak to
their passions, he cannot speak to any purpose at
all. No argument can be proposed for any course
of action, but what implies an address to some pas∣sion
or affection. If a man tell me, it is for my
interest, he addresses my self-love; if for my
honour, he addresses my ambition; if for the public
good, he addresses my benevolence; in a word,
whatever motive can be proposed, it addresses itself
to some one of those passions or affections which
are the only principles of our actions. Suppose a
person destitute of these, and the strongest reasoning
will have no effect upon him. If I should prove
clearly and convincingly, that a certain action
tends to happiness, this will have no influence on
a person destitute of self-love. If I prove that an
action tends to honour, a person void of ambition
would tell me, I am convinced it does, but I have
no desire of honour. These principles cannot be
disputed; and when they are admitted, to say that
a preacher should confine himself to cool reasoning,
and not address the passions of his hearers, is to
say, that he should excite them to action, without
applying to the only principles of their nature
which can excite them to action; or rather it is to
say, that he should address these principles, but
that he must be careful to address them only in
<PB N="302" REF="309"/>
such a way as has no tendency to engage them.
This is a plain absurdity, though it be sometimes
expressed in such terms as to give it some show of
plausibility. Reasoning which tends to show that
a course is conducive to interest or honour, will
have some influence in determining those to that
course, who have previously self-love or ambition
in a considerable degree of strength; but if these
principles be weak, or be counteracted by other
principles, it will have no influence upon them.
But even when these principles are weak, or so
overborne by opposite principles as to be hindered
from exerting themselves, they may be excited
and strengthened by a proper address to the
passions. The want of this must therefore be an
essential defect in a discourse intended for per∣suasion.</P>
<P>Having thus laid open the general principles of
suasory discourses, we shall now point out briefly
their different kinds. They are plainly distinguish∣able
into two kinds. 1. Such as are designed to
dissuade from vice. In order to do this, two
things are necessary; to weaken the passions which
lead to vice, and to stir up and strengthen such
passions or affections as may oppose and check
these. To dissuade from intemperance, for in∣stance,
one may give such a view of sensual plea∣sure
as tends to check the desire of it; and he may
give such a view of the pleasure and reward of
abstinence, or of the misery and punishment of
<PB N="303" REF="310"/>
intemperance, as may raise desire of the former,
and dread of the latter, for antagonists to sensual
appetite. A passion is weakened by methods con∣trary
to those by which it is raised. All that
belongs to this sort of discourse is therefore easily
deducible from the principles which have been
already laid down.—2. Such as are designed to
persuade to virtue. In these too, it is necessary
both to strengthen virtuous affections, and those
principles which co-operate with them, and to
weaken such vicious passions and principles as
would draw off from the course recommended.</P>
<P>In suasory as well as in probatory discourses, one
may proceed either in the direct or indirect method
of reasoning; either by urging direct arguments
for any course of virtue, or against any course of
vice, or by removing the pretences by which men
commonly prevail upon themselves to neglect the
virtue or indulge the vice, or excuse themselves in
doing so. Thus a suasory discourse intended to
prevail on men not to delay repentance, might pro∣ceed
either by proving directly the danger of
delaying it, from the difficulty of religion, from
the continual increase of the strength of vicious
habits, from the uncertainty of life, &amp;c. or by
removing the excuses which men plead for delay∣ing
it, from mistaken notions of grace, from want
of leisure at present, &amp;c.—Suasory discourses may
be again divided in another view; into such as
persuade to virtue in general, or dissuade from
<PB N="304" REF="311"/>
vice in general, and such as have for their object
some one particular virtue or vice. These kinds
differ only in the extent of their subject, not at all
in the rules of prosecu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them. It will be suffi∣cient
therefore to observe on this head, that,
because men are little affected with generals, it
will be often necessary to descend to particular
virtues and vices, and labour to inculcate a due
conduct with regard to them. If a minister
employ himself only in recommending religion and
holiness in general, men will have no distinct
conception of what is included in them, and every
person will find it very easy to satisfy himself that
he is not defective. But when particular branches
of conduct are made the frequent subjects of preach∣ing,
men will more readily discover their own
faults, and by this means be laid open to the full
force of all the arguments that are used. Whether
a general course of conduct, or a particular branch
of it, be the subject of a sermon, that sermon
may be employed in enforcing it, either from all
the topics that recommend it, or from some one
class of topics. These two differ likewise only in
the extent of the subject, and therefore admit the
very same rules. It is only necessary to observe,
that wherever different arguments, deduced either
from the same or different topics, are used in a
discourse, they should be placed in such an order,
that each may appear to spring naturally from the
foregoing, 'and that all may lend the greatest
strength to one another.—I shall mention but one
<PB N="305" REF="312"/>
division more of suasory discourses. Some of them
recommend one course from a variety of topics;
others of them recommend a variety of courses
from one and the same topic. The examples that
we have already hinted at, are all instances of the
former kind. For an instance of the latter, we
may suppose the preacher, from this single topic,
the consideration of death as our departure from
this world, urging his hearers not to set an immo∣derate
value on present earthly things, not to enter∣tain
an immoderate fondness for them, not to
employ endless labour about them, not to despise
those who are in lower worldly circumstances than
themselves, not to abuse their present possessions,
not to commit sin in order to avoid the loss of
them, not to murmur for the want of them, not
to be impatient under real and positive afflictions,
not to envy others. There are many subjects
which naturally direct a preacher to follow this
method in a suasory discourse upon them.</P>
<P>We have not considered the several-branches of
that division of pulpit discourses which we deduced
from the ends of speaking; and this division has
given us an opportunity of proposing the general
rules of each kind of discourse, so far as they arise
from its peculiar end. There is nothing that can
come within the province of a preacher, that is not
reducible to one or other of the kinds which we
have described. And there is none of these kinds
<PB N="306" REF="313"/>
which does not properly belong to his province.
Indeed, all these aims are constantly considered as
belonging to a preacher. There is but one respect
in which the manner of their belonging to him is
generally considered as different from that manner
in which we have represented them. We have
considered them as different kinds of sermons; and
they are commonly considered as different parts of
one sermon. Which of these two ways of consi∣dering
them is most proper will appear afterwards,
when we come to consider Preaching in another
light. At present we shall only observe, that
though they were to be regarded as different parts
of one sermon, yet as the ends aimed at are dif∣ferent,
and as the principles of composition suited
to these ends are likewise different, it will still be
necessary to consider them separately; and there∣fore
all that has been said is equally applicable to
Preaching on that supposition, as on the suppo∣sition
which we have followed.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="5">
<HEAD>ART. V. Of Invention.</HEAD>
<P>We have considered Preaching with respect to
the various ends at which it aims, and the kinds of
discourses which arise from that variety. This has
led us to remark the most general rules belonging
to each species of Preaching. The eloquence of
the pulpit may be considered in another light; with
respect to the different exertions of mind which it
requires in the speaker. This is a light in which
<PB N="307" REF="314"/>
writers on the principles of rhetoric have always
chosen to consider every kind of composition;
There have been disputes among them concerning
the number of mental exertions belonging properly
to eloquence, which are too trivial to deserve our
entering into them. They are generally reckoned
five; invention, disposition, elocution, memory;
and pronunciation; and according to this distinc∣tion,
the parts of eloquence are commonly rec∣koned,
By prosecuting this division, we shall
have an opportunity of laying down the particular
rules of pulpit discourses, regarding the subject,
the method, the style, and composition, the man∣dating,
and the delivering. As this is the division
that is commonly followed, in explaining the prin∣ciples
of eloquence, by the writers of institutions, a
number of their rules are applicable to Preaching;
and as you can have recourse to them, we may
treat more shortly of them.</P>
<P>The first exertion of mind necessary in every
discourse is invention, which is therefore reckoned
the first part of eloquence. Under this head we
shall consider the helps of invention, the choice of
subjects, the qualities of texts, the exordium, the
explication of text and context, the laying down
the design, the division, the prosecution, and the
conclusion. These parts are common to all kinds
of discourses.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="315"/>
The helps of invention are of two kinds, mediate
or remote, and immediate. The former are of
very great consequence; they in some measure
remove the need of the latter; but without them,
the latter cannot be sufficient. By the mediate
or remote helps of invention, I mean previous
application, and a fund of knowlege. This is so
necessary for a public speaker, that all the ancient
writers on rhetoric require almost universal know∣lege
in an orator. Without a considerable stock
of solid knowlege, a preacher's head will seem
unfurnished; he will appear to labour for matter
to fill up his discourse; he will not seem to speak
from the abundance of his heart, but will talk as
if he were at a loss for the very next thing he is to
say. He lives, as it were, from hand to mouth,
without laying up any stock of provision; and
therefore, whatever pains he takes about his
discourses, they appear always thin and half∣starved.
Though he could afford three months
for studying a sermon, such particular preparations,
however troublesome, must needs be very imper∣fect.
Preachers ought to employ several years in
laying up a plentiful stock of solid knowlege; and
then, after such a general preparation, their parti∣cular
discourses will cost them the less pains. But
if, without any preparatory study, a man only
apply to a particular subject, as he has occasion to
preach on it, he is forced to put off his hearers
with common-place notions and superficial remarks.
<PB N="309" REF="316"/>
If a man be only acquainted with controversy, and
have read sermons, he may thus pick up a few
thoughts; but either they will be merely specu∣lative,
or by being borrowed at second-hand, they
will be indigested, dead, and pointless.</P>
<P>A sermon is a discourse founded on scripture,
and addressed to men; a preacher must therefore
have these three qualifications, the knowlege of
scripture, of human nature, and of human life.
These ought to be the three great branches of his
study.</P>
<P>The knowlege of scripture must be acquired by
reading it much, and that in the original lan∣guages;
and by reading it critically, that we may
remember not only the words, the doctrines, the
precepts, the histories recorded in holy writ, but
also thoroughly understand their meaning, and
their application. The most beautiful and striking
parts of the best sermons are the scriptures which
are interwoven with them; and, if they were
always entirely apposite, and urged with their full
force, they would be almost irresistible.</P>
<P>Sermons should also be deeply founded in human
nature. I do not mean that sermons should be
abstract discourses on the principles of human
nature. But when men's feelings are truly deli∣neated,
when all maxims and directions that are
given, are perfectly suitable to the principles of
<PB N="310" REF="317"/>
the mind, then the sermon may be truly said to be
founded in human nature; and no species of ar∣gument
will make a deeper impression, or produce
a more solid and thorough conviction. In order
to be able to give his discourses, in this manner,
a foundation in human nature, a preacher must
study carefully the philosophy of man, especially
of his moral and active powers. A person who is
unacquainted with this branch of knowlege must
be often at a loss and in danger of misrepresenting
things, when he is to address himself to mankind
on subjects of practice. This part of philosophy
must not be neglected when the ordinary time
of education in it is expired; it is rather to be
then begun, for it is generally only after this that
men's faculties are ripe for the study of it.</P>
<P>The third requisite mentioned was the knowlege
of human life. Without this, our descriptions
must be false and unnatural, and can never strike.
It is to be acquired by observation, and by the
study of history. Biography is the most proper
kind of history for this purpose. It relates many
minute circumstances, actions, and sayings of a
person's life, which serve very much to let us into
his real character. It is often proper in sermons,
to adduce professed examples, either of the nature,
influence, and deceit of vice, of the nature and
exertions of virtue in real life, or of their conse∣quences,
rewards, and punishments. For most
part, these should be taken from scripture, and
<PB N="311" REF="318"/>
more sparingly at least from prophane history.
But even when a preacher does not choose pro∣fessedly
to make use of examples, it will be ex∣tremely
useful to have them in his eye, that he
may frame his explication, description, or argu∣ment,
according to what has really been. The
perusal of history with a view to acquire a know∣lege
of real life, will, in a great measure, prepare
men for using the other method of acquiring this
knowlege; will train them to that acuteness, at∣tention,
and thoughtfulness, which are necessary
for their making observations themselves on man∣kind,
and tracing out characters which they meet
with in real life.</P>
<P>The immediate helps of invention are the works
of other men, from which assistance may be de∣rived.
These may be reduced to two forts. First,
models which are proper to be imitated. These
are finished and regular discourses, either on the
subjects which the preacher is to treat, or on other
subjects. Those which are on different subjects
are the most useful helps, as they give an impulse
to genius, and a direction to judgement, without
laying him under a temptation merely to tran∣scribe.
The ancient orations, particularly those
of Demosthenes and Cicero; the most finished and
elegant sermons, and even some of the poets, may
be highly useful for directing genius, and forming
the taste in Preaching. The second sort of helps
are such sermons and compositions as are rude and
<PB N="312" REF="319"/>
indigested as to the manner, but contain plenty of
materials. A preacher cannot copy after these as
models, but he may dig in them as in a mine.
‘They are like a piece of rich ore, in which he
may find matter for the furniture of pulpit dis∣courses,
and find, at the same time, such a
defect of refinement and polishing, as to leave
room for the exercise of his own genius and
talents to finish and rub them up. He may
find a rich collection of noble sentiments, and
strong and nervous expressions, but delivered
with such negligence of dress, as to style or me∣thod,
as leaves abundance of room for the ex∣ercise
of his own powers in altering and me∣thodising
whatever materials he borrows from
them. We may apply to such productions what
Pope says of the works of Shakspeare; “One
may look upon them, in comparison of those
that are more finished and regular, as upon an
ancient majestic piece of Gothic architecture,
compared with a neat modern building: the
latter is more elegant and glaring, but the
former is more strong and more solemn.”</P>
<P>In using the immediate helps of invention, a
preacher may take two different ways. He may
first read and digest all that he chooses to consult
on the subject, and then, laying aside the books,
and meditating on his subject, he may form his
own plan, and dispose the materials which he finds
in his mind, in his own manner and style. Or,
<PB N="313" REF="320"/>
he may first form his own plan, and prosecute it
in the way which he thinks most proper, and
then read over writers on the subject; and after
having read them, review his own composition,
and alter or add to it according to the new mate∣rials
which he finds suggested to him by his read∣ing.
The latter method will give a sermon most
the appearance of an original, and is, perhaps, for
the most part eligible; but the former may be
very properly used, either when one is not pre∣viously
so well acquainted with a particular subject
on which he is to compose, or when he is obliged
to compose in haste. These are the only two ways
in which a preacher ought to use the works of
others. Merely to compile a sermon by tacking
together passages which please him, from others
who have written on the subject, is always abso∣lutely
wrong; it gives the whole the appearance
of patchwork; there is no consistence in the parts,
either as to the train of thought, or as to the style.
If one cannot compose sermons in another way,
it were much better to borrow complete sermons
from the works of others. But certainly, a man
who is under a necessity of doing either this, or
what is more improper, ought never to have at∣tempted
Preaching, or addicted himself to a pro∣fession
for which he is so ill qualified.</P>
<P>We proceed next to make some observations on
the choice of subjects. As to the nature of the
different subjects which may be properly chosen
<PB N="314" REF="321"/>
for a discourse from the pulpit, it will be unne∣cessary
to say any thing, after what has been al∣ready
said concerning the kinds of discourses.
There have been unhappy differences about the
kind of subjects on which a preacher ought to
insist. An opposition has been established between
what is called Gospel-preaching, and what is called
Legal-preaching. I hope this ill-judged and ill-defined
distinction is now pretty much out of doors,
at least with most people; and therefore, it will
not be needful to enter so deep into the subject
as might, perhaps, have been proper when it was
more in vogue. On this, as well as on most sub∣jects,
it appears to me that men have gone into
extremes. The patrons of what was called Gospel-preaching
insisted chiefly on the doctrines of reli∣gion,
or rather, on some few of the peculiar doc∣trines
of Christianity; on the righteousness and
sacrifice of Jesus Christ, on faith in him, on the
great grace of the evangelical dispensation, and on
the assistances of the Divine Spirit. They were
certainly in the right to insist much on these; but
they were, notwithstanding, blameable in several
respects. They considered these doctrines, not in
the genuine strain of the New Testament, which
explains them with the greatest simplicity, and
always urges them as arguments for the practice
of holiness; but in the strain of disputatious sys∣tems,
encumbered with technical terms and subtle
distinctions, and so as wholly to draw off men's
attention from practice, instead of contributing to
<PB N="315" REF="322"/>
excite them to good practice. They omitted many
other parts of the gospel, equally necessary and
important with these doctrines; while they en∣larged
on the blessings of the gospel and the means
by which they were procured, they were very
sparing in recommending the character which we
must maintain, and the conduct we must pursue,
if we would be partakers of them, though to ani∣mate
us to this is evidently the only end, for which
either the nature of the blessings themselves, or
the method of their conveyance, was revealed by
God. They indeed often described faith in Christ;
but they did not enough either describe or recom∣mend
that love and those works which will always
spring from true faith; they rather seemed to de∣preciate
them, as if they would have made man∣kind
afraid of being holy, left they should trust in
it, and rob the Redeemer of his glory in saving
sinners; thus directly opposing the strain in which
both our Saviour and his apostles spoke, who al∣ways
urge men to holiness, and set the righteous
in opposition to the wicked. Instead of repre∣senting
the assistances of the Spirit as they are
always represented in holy writ, as encourage∣ments
and incitements to diligence, they held them
forth in such a light as tended rather to make men
wait indolently till the Spirit should operate upon
them, than to exert their utmost endeavours to
do their duty in a dependence on its aids. When
they either explained or recommended holiness,
they were so careful to represent it as arising from
<PB N="316" REF="323"/>
grace, that they scarcely either exhorted to it, or
showed the obligations men were under to culti∣vate
it. In short, their sermons were too little cal∣culated
to influence practice. On the other hand,
the patrons of what was called Legal-preaching,
represented religion as practical, explained and in∣culcated
the several duties of it, urged the argu∣ments
which reason or revelation supplied for the
practice of virtue, insisted on the great doctrines of
natural religion which the gospel pre-supposes, as
well as the doctrines of pure revelation which it
superadds to them. So far they considered Preach∣ing
in its proper light. But they were not wholly
blameless. They often represented the virtues of
the Christian life too much in the abstract manner
of philosophy, and in the terms of art of modern
scholasticism. They insisted, perhaps, too seldom
on the peculiar doctrines of revelation, and on the
duties which result from the new relations of which
it informs us. In opposition to both extremes, a
Christian preacher ought to insist both on the doc∣trines
and on the duties of religion; always repre∣senting
the former as arguments for the latter,
and the practice of the latter as absolutely necessary
to render our knowlege of the former really useful
to us; and always expressing the whole, as much
as possible, in the strain of scripture language.
This is undoubtedly Gospel-preaching; for it is to
preach in the same way that Christ preached, and
that his apostles wrote.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="324"/>
What farther remains with regard to the choice
of subjects is, the qualities of any particular subject
which is chosen. The only quality that it will be
necessary to take notice of is, that in every sermon
there should be unity of design. This is a funda∣mental
rule in every sort of composition; but in
none is it more frequently neglected than in
sermons. It is indeed so universally disregarded,
that it may perhaps appear to many a singularity
and affectation either to recommend it or to adhere
to it in Preaching. But, however little it has been
followed in practice, it has been recommended by
some who have written on Preaching, particularly
by Bishop Burnet and the Archbishop of Cambray.
It is indeed a rule founded in the most essential prin∣ciples
of human nature. Man, being a reasonable
being, thinks and speaks with some intention and
design. He has always some end in view, however
wrong and trifling the end itself, or however im∣proper
the means by which he endeavours the
attainment of the end, may often be. It is there∣fore
requisite that in all compositions the writer
have some plan or object. A production without
a design would resemble more the ravings of a
madman, than the regular effects of thought and
genius. Now, if there must be a design or plan,
there ought likewise to be unity of design. When
this is wanting, there is no bond of connection
between the different subjects treated of, which
may bring them under one plan or view, and
which may easily convey the mind from one of
<PB N="318" REF="325"/>
them to the other. The understanding finds it
difficult, when it has been filled with the concep∣tion
of one object, to make a transition to another
wholly different, and cannot easily conceive that
other in a strong and lively manner. Even the
understanding is perplexed and confounded and
distracted; but if the nature of the subject be
such as tends to excite the passions, the inconve∣nience
is still greater. When the passions are
excited by one object, they will pass easily to
another connected with it; but they will pass with
difficulty or not at all along different objects quite
unconnected with one another. By this means a
preacher, by introducing different subjects and
different designs into one sermon, would lose all
that communication of emotions by which alone he
can interest the heart, and raise the passions to a
proper pitch.</P>
<P>If unity of design be necessary in a sermon, it
will be proper to consider how it may be preserved,
what is to be deemed a deviation from it, and
what degree of variety is consistent with it. We
have already reckoned up several kinds of dis∣courses.
It was with a view to the propriety of
unity of design, that we called them distinct
kinds; for most commonly they are all united in
the same discourse, and all seem to be equally
principal, and their ends equally ultimate in the
intention of the preacher. Now, by explaining
how far these kinds may allowably be combined,
<PB N="319" REF="326"/>
and how far not, all will be done that is necessary
on this subject of unity of design. There is one
case, in which all or most of the kinds of discourses
that have been mentioned, may be joined together
even professedly in discoursing from one text. It
is when that text is made the subject of several
discourses, and every separate discourse is the pro∣secution
of one of the designs proposed. For
instance, if 2 Corinth, v. 14. be chosen for a text,
“The love of Christ constraineth us, because we
thus judge, that if one died for all, then were
all dead.” To prosecute all the designs which
are implied in this verse, one might propose such
a method as this: 1. To show that, previous to
the interposition of Christ, all men were in a state
of death. 2. To show that Christ died, that he
might redeem us from this state of death. 3. To
show that this interposition of Christ was a display
of the greatest love. 4. To urge the death of
Christ for us, and the love which it manifested, as
an argument for Christian obedience. If we con∣sider
this as a method proposed for one discourse, it
will have too little unity of design. But if these
four heads be made the subject of four discourses,
each discourse will be properly one; the three
former of the probatory, the last of the suasory
kind. Each will be as really distinct from the
other, as if it had been preached from a distinct
text; and each will have its own unity of design:
the preacher only saves himself the trouble of
finding out a new text for every sermon. Some∣times
<PB N="320" REF="327"/>
it may be eligible to use this method;
thus, if one choose a text which is a general
exhortation to any duty, as Ephes. v. 2. “walk
in love,” he may with equal propriety propose,
in any single discourse, either to explain the nature
of Christian love or charity, or to enforce the
practice of it. If therefore he think it proper to
insist on both these subjects, he may certainly
prosecute the former in one discourse, and the
latter in another discourse from the same text,
without transgressing any of the rules of compo∣sition.
Sometimes again it will be more eligible
to choose different texts for the different points
which one designs to prosecute; as when some of
them are but obscurely implied in a text which
treats of the others; when the subjects which
might be found implied in one text are very dif∣ferent
and unconnected; when prosecuting them
all in so many different discourses would occasion
one's insisting too long on one text, so that it
might become tedious and disagreeable to the
hearers, and wear off that expectation of novelty
which a new text is apt to raise. But which of
these methods he will choose must be left to the
judgement of the preacher on particular occasions.
Only it must be remembered that the subject of
each separate discourse should be strictly one.</P>
<P>In order to this, it is necessary that in every
discourse some one of the ends of Preaching above
taken notice of should be the leading and principal
<PB N="321" REF="328"/>
design of the preacher, and that every thing intro∣duced
into the sermon should be rendered sub∣ordinate
to that end. To propose explication,
proof, persuasion, as different ends all equally
principal in the same discourse, is plainly to deviate
from unity. One of them diverts the attention
from the other, and tends to distract the mind.
But though, to preserve unity, it be absolutely
necessary that some one of the ends of Preaching
be the leading design in a sermon, yet others of
the ends may be aimed at as subordinate to that
end which is predominate. For instance, if the
design of a discourse be to explain any duty, what,
if it were alone, would form a demonstrative or
panegyrical discourse, may very properly be intro∣duced
as a means of explication. An illustrious
example of that virtue exercised by a person in
real life, will show the proper exertions of that
virtue more plainly than any abstract precepts that
could be given; and, while it thus does not inter∣fere
with the end, explication, but promotes it, it
will very effectually, though without an appear∣ance
of designing it, strike the conscience with a
sense of its obligation, and dispose men to practise
what they are made to see belongs to their duty.
Thus, in an explicatory discourse, the demon∣strative
may be incorporated, so as to contribute to
the main end of the discourse.</P>
<P>Again, in a probatory discourse, it is necessarily
supposed that the doctrine to be proved is previously
<PB N="322" REF="329"/>
understood. It would be a deviation from unity to
propose first the explication, and then the proof of
the doctrine, as two independent heads. But
though explication be not directly proposed, yet
the whole proof may be, and ought to be, con∣ducted
in such a way, as may of course carry
explication along with it, and really make the
doctrine understood, while it proposes only to
confirm it. Indeed, the eviction of a doctrine
includes explication so naturally, that an argu∣ment
cannot be justly prosecuted, without its
showing, in every step of it, what is the nature of
the truth which it is brought to prove. In a pro∣batory
discourse, indeed in any discourse, it would
be wrong to make a digression to explain a difficult
text of scripture which is brought in incidentally;
but yet some explication of scripture, viz. so far as
it is subservient to illustration or proof, may be
very properly introduced in any discourse. In a
suasory discourse, persuasion ought to be the only
professed design of the whole; every thing that is
introduced should be regarded but as a mean of
promoting this end. But explication, proof, and
painting, are, from the very nature of this discourse,
necessarily introduced, not for their own sakes, or
as a part of the professed design of the preacher,
but as means of persuasion. Examples are very
proper motives to practice, and therefore may be
here displayed in all their beauty, and directly
urged as motives to good practice. In a word, all
that is necessary for preserving unity of design in a
<PB N="323" REF="330"/>
sermon is, that one simple design be proposed;
that every thing introduced be such as tends to
promote that design, and be set in the par∣ticular
light in which it will tend most to pro∣mote
it.</P>
<P>It will appear, from what has been said, that the
ordinary way of dividing sermons into so many
distinct and independent heads, is scarcely consistent
with unity of design. But it must be remarked,
that every division is by no means inconsistent with
it. A discourse is naturally divided into parts,
according to the branches of the subject to be
explained, or the arguments which are urged.
But even a division, very little different from such
as are commonly proposed, and prosecuted in a
manner very little different, may be easily contrived
so as to be rendered consistent with unity of design.
We may illustrate this by some examples. We
already mentioned a method which might be pro∣posed,
and would very probably be proposed in
the ordinary way of preaching, on 2 Corinth, v. 14.
and which is inconsistent with unity of design.
Yet if, in preaching on that text, it were proposed
as the design of the sermon, to urge men to live
to Christ by the practice of holiness, from the con∣sideration
of his death, all the very same heads
which we mentioned before might be introduced
very consistently with unity of design, with no
other variation but that of proposing and prose∣cuting
<PB N="324" REF="331"/>
them as motives or arguments to this con∣duct.
One might propose to pursue the design, by
showing that the death of Christ urges us to holiness
and the obedience of his gospel, by evincing,
1. That without being thus interested in his death,
we must be in a state of death and misery: 2. That
we are bound to it, because it was the very design
of Christ's death to deliver us from the bondage of
sin: 3. That we are bound by his death to obey
him, in gratitude for the love which his submitting
to death for us manifested. Thus again, in preach∣ing
from Matth. v. 8. “Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God,” the common
method is, 1. to explain purity of heart; 2. to
explain the blessedness of seeing God; 3. to show
the connection between them. Here, three differ∣ent
heads, though not unconnected, yet separate
and independent, are proposed as equally principal.
But if one would preserve unity of design on this
subject, it would be proper to propose, as the
design of the discourse, to enforce the practice of
holiness from the happiness in the enjoyment of
God which is connected with it; and in prose∣cuting
this simple design, all that is necessary for
explaining either the nature of holiness or of its
reward might be introduced so as to be rendered
subservient to it. It is needless to multiply ex∣amples.
If men be once sensible that an adherence
to unity is proper, it will be easy to discourse on
every subject so as to preserve it.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="332"/>
I would not be understood to mean that an ad∣herence
to unity of design is so indispensably ne∣cessary
in every sermon, that it should never be
departed from in a single instance. But certainly
it is a rule of composition so plainly founded in
human nature, that it ought not to be departed
from often, or without any reason at all. A strict
adherence to it will indeed render Preaching more
difficult. It is not so easy to keep one design con∣tinually
in view, and promote it through a whole
discourse, as, without forming any design, to speak
a little upon different views of a subject. But a
Christian minister ought to follow, not the method
of Preaching which is easiest, but what is most
proper and useful.</P>
<P>In considering Preaching with respect to the
different exertions of mind employed in it, which
are commonly called the parts of eloquence, we
naturally began with invention, and have already
considered the helps of invention, and the quali∣ties
of the subject in general. We shall now con∣sider
invention, as it regards the several parts of a
pulpit discourse.</P>
<P>The first of these is the text. It is a part of
scripture which contains the subject of the discourse,
and by its being divinely inspired, gives weight
and authority to it. We already made all the ob∣servations
that are necessary, with respect to those
passages of scripture which are the texts of such
<PB N="326" REF="333"/>
discourses as we termed Lectures. The observations
which we are now to make, regard the discourses
which are properly termed Sermons. From the
nature and design of a text, it will follow that the
principal qualities which should be sought for in
it, are such, as these. 1. It should be a propo∣sition
containing the intention and substance of the
sermon, so that the text may be the sermon in
epitome, and the sermon the text spread out and
expanded. It is a fault to prefix a text as if it
were only a motto to a discourse which has some
relation to it, but does not prosecute its real in∣tention
and design. It deprives the discourse of
the weight and authority which might arise from
its being evidently founded on the text. If the
subject of the sermon be such that a text directly
expressing it cannot be found in scripture, it gives
a strong presumption, that that is not a proper
subject of Preaching; and if a text directly imply∣ing
it can be found, it shows want of judgement
in a preacher to choose one that does not. It will
not be difficult to find texts which have this quality
for any subject of true religion. A general as∣sertion
of a doctrine will serve either for a sermon
intended to explain that doctrine, or for one in∣tended
to prove it. For a sermon designed to ex∣plain
a duty, one may choose either a general ex∣hortation
to that duty, or a place of scripture
which enumerates the parts of the duty. In order
to persuade to a duty, one may choose a text
which either contains a general exhortation to it,
<PB N="327" REF="334"/>
or expresses its obligation, its necessity, or advan∣tages.
2. A text should be simple; it should not
only contain the whole subject, but likewise it
should contain nothing besides it. Without this,
either there will be some part of it which has no∣thing
to answer to it in the sermon; or the sermon
must contain two or more subjects instead of one.
At least, if the text be complex, one part of it
should be made the subject of each single discourse.
3. A text should be plain, that it may not require
long time and great pains for clearing up the mean∣ing
of it, or making it understood, and thus detain
too long from the prosecution of the subject which
it contains. 4. A text is the better if it be short,
for it will be the more easily remembered. All
the qualities opposite to these are faults in a text,
though not all equally unpardonable. It may not
be always, easy to find a text at once simple, plain,
and short, for every subject which a preacher may
think it useful to insist upon. And certainly he
ought not to lay aside an useful subject merely be∣cause
he cannot find a text in all respects such as
he would choose. It is one of the most unpardon∣able
faults in a text, not to imply truly the subject
of the discourse. If it only resemble it in sound,
it is a mere playing upon words; it is in no proper
sense a foundation for the discourse. All texts
that, in relation to the subject, have any appear∣ance
of wit, or humour, or conceit, are very im∣proper,
for they are unsuitable to the dignity and
gravity of the pulpit. It has been disputed, whe∣ther
<PB N="328" REF="335"/>
a text should be chosen for the subject, or
the subject chosen and the discourse made for the
text. In all discourses formed in the textual me∣thod,
in all which we have comprehended under
the name of Lectures, the latter must be the case.
And the opinion of those who have determined
that this latter should always be the case, seems to
have arisen from their admitting only the textual
method of Preaching. But in the several other
kinds of sermons of which we have taken notice,
there seems to be no impropriety in choosing a
text for the subject. And any text expressing the
subject will obviously appear to suit a discourse
properly made on that subject. But a subject may
often be distorted or prevented from being repre∣sented
in the most natural and striking manner, by
being studiously adapted to the phrases and manner
of expression of a particular text. It is, perhaps,
the best way in general to choose the subject and
form the design of the discourse first of all, then to
fix on a text which expresses it, and with that text
in view to compose the discourse.</P>
<P>The exordium naturally succeeds the text. Its
end is to prepare the minds of the hearers for the
discourse. It is sometimes not necessary to use an
exordium, because their minds need no prepara∣tion;
as when we are to discourse on a subject
that is easy and generally acceptable, and against
which they entertain no prejudices. If one choose
an exordium here, it may be employed in repre∣senting
<PB N="329" REF="336"/>
the subject as generally acknowleged to be
useful, and as, therefore, confessedly important
and worthy of regard, though too little regarded
in practice. Sometimes again, a preacher combats
the prejudices of men, as when he defends a doc∣trine
which they are disposed to reject, or incul∣cates
a duty which is perhaps unfashionable. In
this case an exordium seems to be necessary, or,
at least, highly useful, and it should, with as much
address. as possible, expose the weakness of the
prejudices against the subject, or insinuate the ne∣cessity
of combating them, or give such an account
of their origin as may dispose men to suspect them,
or hint that it is the preacher's sense of their dan∣gerous
tendency that leads him to endeavour to
remove them. The importance of the subject, and
the near concern which the hearers have in it, is
often a very proper topic for an exordium; but it
should not spend itself in mere general assertions
to this purpose, but suggest such sentiments as may
convince the hearers. This will have a great ten∣dency
to engage them to attention, and to dispose
them to give the discourse a favourable hearing.
The exordium may sometimes be employed in lay∣ing
open such principles as tend to make the sub∣ject
better understood, and thus both dispose the
hearers for attending to it, and prepare them for
profiting by it. Sometimes, a piece of history,
especially of sacred history, may be very properly
turned into an exordium; particularly when the
text is introduced by a history; in this case, the
<PB N="330" REF="337"/>
exordium will coincide with the giving a view of
the context. But it would be tedious to mention
all the topics from which introductions may be de∣duced,
or to illustrate them by examples. From
whatever topics the exordium be deduced, it
should be fit for answering its end, for preparing
the minds of the hearers. In order to prepare
their minds for profiting by the discourse, it is
necessary to render them <HI>attentive,</HI> for without
this they cannot either understand or apply it; to
render them <HI>docile,</HI> or fit to apprehend and receive
it; and <HI>benevolent,</HI> ready to give a fair hearing to
the preacher. These dispositions should be kept
up through the whole discourse, but it is the bu∣siness
of the exordium or introduction to raise
them. All the topics already mentioned, and all
the topics proper for introductions, must be sub∣servient
to some of these purposes of the intro∣duction.
An introduction is faulty if it be com∣mon,
or such as may be applied with equal pro∣priety
to almost any subject. It ought to rise
naturally from the subject, and to lead directly to
the next part of the discourse; it should appear to
be taken, as it were, from the very bowels of the
subject, and be fit to give an opening to it; on
this account, it has been the opinion of some rhe∣torical
writers, that, though it comes first in
order, it ought generally to be thought of last,
after the whole design is thoroughly digested; but
I imagine that, in this way, there would be great
danger of its being forced, and not cohering suffi∣ciently
<PB N="331" REF="338"/>
with the sermon. The introduction should
generally be cool, for it is natural to begin calmly,
and to rise to warmth by degrees, in proportion
as one is more engaged by his subject. But when
the subject is obviously interesting, and when the
text gives an affecting view of it, a warm and ve∣hement
exordium is allowable, and will have a
great influence on the audience. That an intro∣duction
may be fit to produce the effects for which
it is designed, it is necessary that the introduction
itself both be understood, and please. In order to
these, it must be plain, the sentences short, every
thing accurate, the expressions proper, but with∣out
an appearance of labour and study, yet smooth
and flowing; it should be fit to catch and entice
the hearers all at once. Finally, an introduction
should be short; immoderate length is a great
fault; it makes it disproportioned to the discourse;
it keeps the main design too long out of view.</P>
<P>The introduction is succeeded by the explication
of the text and context. The design of explaining
the text is to make it understood, and to show that
it really contains that which is the subject of the
discourse. By showing this before-hand, the
preacher is freed from the necessity of distorting
his subject during the prosecution of it, to accom∣modate
it to the precise words and form of ex∣pression
in that particular text. Whenever, there∣fore,
the text is perfectly plain of itself, and ob∣viously
contains the subject of the discourse, it is
<PB N="332" REF="339"/>
superfluous to spend time in explaining it. The
only design of explaining the context is to show,
from the intention of the writer and the connection
of the text with what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>goes before, that the mean∣ing
which the preacher puts upon it is its real and
genuine sense, and that he, therefore, pursues in
his discourse what is its true import. On this ac∣count
it is evident that when a context is plain,
no explication of it is necessary for investigating
the true meaning of the text; and when there is
no dependence of the text on what precedes, any
notice of the context is superfluous. When an
explication of the text, or the context, or of both,
is necessary, the rules of it may be deduced from
what has been already said of lectures. We shall
only observe that the explication should be as short
as possible; for it is rather a preparation to the
design, than a direct part of it.</P>
<P>The next part is the design. It should coincide
with the import of the text, and should be pro∣posed
in a single proposition. By this means it
will appear clearly what is the point at which the
preacher is to drive; and the hearers will be pre∣pared
for perceiving the subservience of every
thing that he says, to this point. It should be
proposed in as plain terms, and set in as striking
a light as possible. It will thus make the deeper
impression on the hearers, and throw greater light
on the whole discourse. An affectation of quaint∣ness
and ingenuity in proposing the design is al∣ways
<PB N="333" REF="340"/>
blameable, as it detracts from its solidity
and weight, and renders it less apt to be under∣stood
or remembered.</P>
<P>From what has been said of the kinds of dis∣courses,
it will be easy to conceive how the design
should be proposed; it will be to explain, to
prove, or to persuade. It is sometimes very pro∣per
to join with the proposition of the design, an
insinuation of the useful purpose which it answers;
for example, when one proposes to explain any
duty, he might add, that all may see what it is that
is incumbent on them, and may be enabled, on
examining themselves, to discern how far they
comply with their duty, and in what respects they
are negligent or defective in it. Or it may be
proper to join with it a direction to such a dispo∣sition
in hearing, as may enable them to apply the
discourse to its proper use, as to reflect on their own
conduct, and examine their own consciences, while
a duty is explained; to ponder the force of every
argument produced, when a truth is confirmed;
and so in other cases. It is very common with the
French preachers to subjoin an Ave Maria to the
proposing of their design. A Protestant preacher
may substitute, in place of this, a short prayer.
If this were always used, it would degenerate into
a mere unaffecting form. But sometimes, when
the subject is uncommonly strinking or solemn, or
when one has been raised to a considerable degree
of warmth in the exordium, or when it has ended
<PB N="334" REF="341"/>
with any mention of the assistances of the divine
spirit, a short prayer for God's rendering the
design effectual may be very properly subjoined to
the proposal of it, and will have great influence.
Sometimes the proposition of the design may be very
properly implied in a prayer or invocation of this
kind. But the varieties which may be admitted,
and the occasions that are proper for them, will
be naturally suggested to a preacher by his subject,
and the circumstances in which he is to speak.</P>
<P>The division or method comes next in order.
It is the proposing of the several parts or members
of the subject, before entering on the prosecution of
them. Divisions were never used by the ancient
orators, and very seldom by the christian fathers.
They were first introduced by the scholastics, and
have been since almost universally retained by
christian preachers. The ancient orators, instead
of proposing before-hand the division which they
were to follow, often even studied to conceal the
distinction of the parts during the prosecution.
Indeed, as their view in speaking was to persuade
their hearers to something which was to be done
immediately, a formal division might have had so
much the appearance of study, as to have pre∣vented
this effect. And as the effect must take
place immediately, it was not necessary to do any
thing which might assist them in retaining after∣wards
a distinct view of the tenor of the discourse.
But a Christian Preacher is to deliver discourses on
<PB N="335" REF="342"/>
important subjects, which, it is taken for granted,
he has carefully considered before-hand, and there∣fore
an appearance of study will not so directly
obstruct any design which he may propose. His
discourse is intended to influence them in a long
course of conduct; and in order to influence them,
it must be remembered and recollected long after
it is heard; in order to which it is necessary that
it be distinctly apprehended when it is heard: the
proposing a division contributes to this end, and is
therefore no ways improper. In a word, a division
is more necessary to preachers than it was to the
ancient orato<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, on account of the different natures
and designs of their discourses; what were incon∣veniences
to them will be none to preachers.
There are doubtless some cases, in which a divi∣sion
will be inconvenient in a sermon. For in∣stance,
it may sometimes happen that all the parts
of a sermon rise naturally out of one another, and
contribute directly to one design; yet if they were
all proposed in the beginning, their connection
and dependence would not appear: in this case, it
is better to omit any prosessed division, and to
content oneself with proposing the general design.
“When a division is given, it should be such as
arises naturally from the subject; such as gives
a light and a just order to the several parts;
such a division as may be easily remembered,
and, at the same time, help to connect and
retain the whole; such a division as shows at
once the extent of the subject and of all its
<PB N="336" REF="343"/>
“parts.” Thus the division of an explicatory
sermon will be according to the different branches
of the doctrine or duty to be explained; that of a
probatory or suasory discourse, according to the
different arguments which are to be urged, for
conviction or persuasion. A division should not
consist of too many members; if it does, most
subjects will be, by this means, cut into pieces
rather than properly distributed into parts; besides,
it will confound both the apprehensions and the
memories of the hearers, and will thus produce
the very inconvenience which it is the only design
of it to prevent. This fault in division generally
proceeds from an affectation of subtlety in distin∣guishing
wherever there is the minutest difference,
sometimes where there is no difference at all. The
French preachers generally confine themselves to
three parts; but some subjects have more than
three distinct members; and, considering the
variety of subjects, no certain number can be
fixed on for every case. A division should be laid
down as shortly, and in as plain terms, as possible,
without either obscure or superfluous expressions.
There should be no affectation of quaintness or
conceit in a division. This is a sault very frequent
in the French preachers. Where there is any
degree of this, it renders the division worse than
it would be in the textual way of deducing the
division, not from the members of the subject,
but from the expressions and clauses of the text.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="344"/>
We come now to consider invention, as em∣ployed
about the prosecution or body of the dis∣course.
This is in every discourse the principal part.
The way in which the ancient rhetoricians treated
of this part, was by pointing out the several sorts
of topics, or common places, from which arguments
or illustrations might be deduced. These they
handled with great subtlety. It is however found
by experience, that these are of little use in practice.
They supply only superficial arguments at the best;
they only give a hint to genius, and sometimes they
rather mislead than direct into the right way. They
may be an ingenious analysis of the heads of argu∣ment;
but they are of no use as a foundation for
speaking. We shall not therefore spend time in
accommodating them to sermons. A thorough
understanding of the subject will be a much better
means of inventing what is proper to be said on it,
than any artificial topics. We have already pre∣vented
ourselves in what might have been observed
concerning the peculiarities of prosecution, accord∣ing
to the different kinds of discourses. All therefore
that remains is to consider what is common to
all the kinds.</P>
<P>The object of invention is the sentiment: it will
not therefore be improper to point out the several
qualities of sentiments or thoughts which a
christian preacher ought to seek after, and of the
faults which he ought to avoid. The first and
fundamental quality of thoughts or sentiments on
<PB N="338" REF="345"/>
every subject is, that they be true and just. Fre∣quently
those thoughts or sentiments which appear
at first sight the brightest, are not just and solid;
yet they are apt to dazzle and please by their
glare, and on that account to be chosen. Such
false thoughts would not, however, pass without
censure by a judicious critic, in a piece of wit, or a
poem. But they are, above all, unsuitable to the
gravity and solemnity of pulpit discourses, and
to the importance of the subjects treated in them.
Truth is the first quality, the very substance of
sentiment: if it want truth, the more bold and
shining it is, the more faulty it must be. Thoughts
are the images of things, and are true no farther
than they represent things faithfully. Again,
thoughts or sentiments ought to be natural. Na∣tural
thoughts are not far-fetched, but arise obvi∣ously
from the subject; so that they seem to have
been found easily and without any labour; and
one would think that they must have occurred to
any person on the subject. The opposite of this
quality is affectation; when sentiments are stu∣diously
stretched and carried too far; when,
instead of being sublime, they are extravagant;
when, instead of being elegant, they are finical;
when, instead of being delicate, they are subtle
and refined. On the contrary, when thoughts are
natural, they bear no mark of study or design; if
an object be described, it is by such appearances of
it as strike every person as soon as they are men∣tioned;
the passions are made to express them∣selves
<PB N="339" REF="346"/>
properly in their own language. But
in avoiding affected sentiments, we must take
care not to fall into such as are flat and languid.</P>
<P>Another quality of sentiment a-kin to the former
is, that it be suitable to the subject. Those senti∣ments
which suit a familiar subject, will not suit
a sublime or pathetic one; those which suit expli∣cation
would be cold in persuasion; those which
would be proper to persuasion would be extrava∣gant
in explication. It is likewise necessary that
sentiments be perspicuous or clear. Obscurity
sometimes belongs to the sentiment as well as to
the expression. When it rises to a great height, it
becomes unintelligible and absolute nonsense. Even
when it is in a less degree, when a thought is so
abstruse as to become dark and hard to be under∣stood,
it is a fault. A thought ought to be so
clear, that persons of tolerable understanding may
comprehend it, without being obliged to employ
too great application of mind. These qualities of
sentiment are universally and indispensably neces∣sary.
There are others which are not necessary in
every case, but ought to be attended to in cases
where they are proper; such as sublimity, beauty,
delicacy, which are so fully explained by critical
writers that it will not be necessary to enlarge on
them.</P>
<P>The last part of a discourse is the conclusion or
peroration, which pretty much coincides with what
<PB N="340" REF="347"/>
is commonly called the application. The conclu∣sion
should always be suitable to the kind and end
of the discourse. We have formerly said all that
is necessary with respect to the conclusion of all
sorts of lectures and textual discourses, and likewise
of those which are explicatory of a particular
character. Those which are designed to explain a
duty, may be concluded in different ways suitable
to their design. It is very proper, after having
explained fully the several parts of it, to recapi∣tulate
the whole; this will both assist the hearers
in remembering what has been advanced for the
direction of their conduct, and what can be of no
use for directing it except, it be remembered; and
will also send to give them a stronger impression of
the connection and dependence of the parts.
Sometimes a recapitulation is all that is necessary
in concluding an explicatory discourse, but it ought
always to be at least a part of the conclusion.
Again, as the design of explaining a duty is to
direct the practice of the hearers, and as they will
not think of altering their conduct except they fee
how far they are deficient, exhortations or direc∣tions
for examining themselves how far they really
practise their duty, may very properly succeed the
recapitulation. Whatever can contribute to their
forming a right judgement of their real character
and conduct in respect of the virtue or vice that
has been illustrated, may very properly be intro∣duced
here. Farther, any directions which may
conduce to their practising the virtue or avoiding
<PB N="341" REF="348"/>
the vice, will justly find a place in the conclusion
of such an explicatory discourse. Sometimes ar∣guments
for the practice of a duty arise from the
very view of the nature of that duty. It is im∣possible,
for instance, to explain resignation, with∣out
mentioning the freedom from inward anxiety
and solicitude which this temper implies. In cases
of this kind it will not be improper to mention
in the conclusion, that, in order to recommend
the duty, it is sufficient to understand its nature,
and to hint at those arguments for it which are
so properly internal, as to be implied in the very
conception of it. Sometimes too, in the conclu∣sion,
a preacher may address exhortations or di∣rections
distinctly to different classes of his hearers,
according to the different ways in which the duty
explained respects them; as to those who wholly
neglect it, and to those who already practise it in
some degree; which will give an opportunity of
pointing out and rebuking such sins or practices as
are remarkably inconsistent with it. Sometimes,
all these parts may be proper in the conclusion of
one discourse; sometimes one or a few of them
will be sufficient. It was already remarked, that a
discourse intended to prove a doctrine, should be
concluded by pointing out its influence on practice,
either in several inferences when it is equally con∣nected
with several duties, or in one deduction
when it is peculiarly subservient to some one branch
of virtue. The fame holds of those discourses,
which are employed in explaining a doctrine. It
<PB N="342" REF="349"/>
remains only therefore to point out briefly, what
ought to be the conclusion of a suasory discourse.
As the design of the whole discourse is to persuade
men to the practice of some duty, so the conclusion
should evidently be calculated for fixing and con∣firming
this effect. What, therefore, ought to be
its nature, will easily appear by recollecting what
has been already observed on the means of per∣suasion.
Argument is absolutely necessary to it;
the conclusion, therefore, ought to contain a sum∣mary
or recapitulation of the several arguments
which have been urged in the discourse. It should
not merely mention the heads of them, but repre∣sent
in brief their whole force, and their greatest
strength. It should, as it were, collect their whole
vigour into one point, that it may be more intense
and affect the more. But, as argument alone does
not persuade without an address to the passions,
so the conclusion must contain not only the sub∣stance
of the whole arguments, but also something
fit to influence and interest the passions. Indeed,
though the pathetic should, in a greater or a less
degree, run through the whole of a suasory dis∣course,
the conclusion is the principal seat of it, in
which it will naturally rise to the greatest degree
of warmth. It is not necessary here, any more
than in the other parts of the discourse, that the
argument and the painting, from which the pa∣thetic
results, should be kept distinct. It is much
better that they be incorporated together so per∣fectly
as to be blended and undistinguishable; that
<PB N="343" REF="350"/>
so the conclusion may at once collect, as it were,
into one point all the light and all the warmth of
the discourse, and leave its full effect upon the
hearts of the hearers.</P>
<P>So much for invention, the first exertion of
mind employed in the eloquence of the pulpit.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="6">
<HEAD>ART. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Disposition.</HEAD>
<P>The second exertion of the mind is disposition,
which is therefore reckoned the second part of
eloquence. It is employed in reducing the whole
train of the discourse, and all its parts, into their
proper order. Order consists in placing things to∣gether
which are naturally connected. Without
a proper disposition, the materials of a discourse
would be a mere confused chaos. In every art,
the disposition of the materials is as essentially ne∣cessary
as the finding them out.</P>
<P>We are prevented in many observations regard∣ing
the particular disposition proper for the dif∣ferent
kinds of discourses, by the account of each
kind that was formerly given. Some of the most
general rules of disposition are likewise sufficiently
implied in the recital, that was made under the
last head, of the order in which the several parts
of a discourse naturally succeed each other. A
few observations upon it will be all that is farther
necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="351"/>
Disposition regards both the whole plan and
each part of it. In the whole plan that order
should be observed, by which every thing may
prepare the way for what succeeds, and preserve
the force of what went before. “Every thing
should be introduced to the best advantage, and
where it is fittest to make a due impression.
Often, that which would seem nothing to the
purpose, by being unseasonably urged, has a
very great weight when it is reserved for its
proper place, till the audience be prepared by
other things to feel all its force and conse∣quence.”
The heads of every doctrine, the
parts of every duty, have a natural connection
and dependence, so that one is first, and the others
succeed in a certain order; and this order ought
to be observed in explaining them. In proving or
persuading by arguments, there is greater latitude
as to the order. Sometimes, indeed, the argu∣ments
have a natural succession, so that one rises
and grows out of another, and one prepares the
way for another. In this case, this natural order
ought to be carefully observed; the simplest should
be placed first, and all of them disposed so that
one may prepare the way for our fully under∣standing
and feeling the force of those which fol∣low,
and every succeeding argument may add to
the weight of those which went before. But often,
the arguments are more unconnected, so that any
of them may, with little impropriety, be placed
first or last. Here, one is left at liberty to choose
<PB N="345" REF="352"/>
any order that he pleases; but even in this case,
one order may be better than another. Thus,
some have advised to begin with the weakest argu∣ments,
and to proceed gradually to the strongest,
that so the reasoning, by continually gathering
force, may complete its effect upon the hearers.
Some again have approved of beginning and end∣ing
with the strongest arguments, and throwing
the weaker reasons into the middle; because we
are naturally attentive at the beginning, and if we
be pleased with what is then said, we hear the rest
with the more favourable disposition, and what
comes last sticks best with us. But in the dispo∣sition
of the general parts of a discourse, a great
deal must be left to the judgement of the preacher;
few universal or invariable rules can be established.</P>
<P>Order is necessary not only in this, but in the
arrangement of each particular part. In general,
it is proper on each head or argument, first to pro∣pose
it briefly, and then to spread it out in the
prosecution, illustrating or urging the whole of it.
But though it be easy to discern when a proper
order is observed, or to discover a particular fault
that is committed, it is not easy to lay down rules
which would not be either too general to be un∣derstood,
or too particular to be useful in every
case. In passing from one part of a discourse to
another, some form of transition is necessary.
English preachers are generally very careless and
unartificial in this, contenting themselves with
<PB N="346" REF="353"/>
mentioning one head when they have finished an∣other,
without being at any pains to run them, as
it were, into one another. Greater care, however,
in this respect would often be attended with good
effects. A transition, for instance, may be made
from the explication of one part of a duty to that
of another, by hinting how the practice of the
former leads to the latter, or how insufficient the
former will be without the latter. In passing from
one argument to another, whether in a probatory
or a suasory discourse, especially in the latter, it
will be proper not to seem to give up the former
arguments, or to allow their force to vanish when
we leave them and proceed to others. This will
be best done by recapitulating the former ones, at
least the one immediately preceding, and profess∣edly
superadding the next one to them. Various
ways of doing this will easily occur on trial.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="7">
<HEAD>ART. VII. Of Elocution.</HEAD>
<P>The third exertion of the preacher is elocution,
which regards the language, style, and composition
of sermons. The language of sermons ought, first
of all, to be plain and perspicuous. In order to at∣tain
this, we must use words that are in common
use, words which are suitable to the subject, avoid∣ing
all technical terms of art, all terms borrowed
from the schools, and all such expressions as are
ambiguous or equivocal, or as are above the un∣derstanding
of the people. “The figures must be
<PB N="347" REF="354"/>
easy though not mean, such as tend to make the
matter better understood.” Too frequent and
too distant metaphors obstruct perspicuity, and turn
the discourse in some measure into a dark allegory.
All confusion in the arrangement of words likewise
produces obscurity. Long periods, such as contain
in them two or three different thoughts, are hard
to be followed or apprehended. Plainness ought
to be preserved in every kind of composition, but
most of all in explication; for the very design of
this being to make things understood, every degree
of obscurity is perfectly unsuitable. The language
of a preacher ought likewise to be pure; we should
avoid all solecisms or faults in construction, all bar∣barisms,
or words and terms that do not truly be∣long
to the language. Mean and low expressions
are unbecoming the dignity of the pulpit, and the
sublimity of the subjects which are there treated,
and must disgust every person of any degree of
understanding. At the same time very great
nicety and correctness of style is lost in a discourse
that is to be but once heard by a common audience.
But a remarkable want of composition, an obvious
roughness and asperity of style, is disagreeable.
There must be some degree of harmony in order
to prevent disgust. The language ought likewise
to be nervous, animated, and affecting. A great
part of the force of a sentiment often depends on
the manner in which it is expressed. What will
have great force if it be expressed in one way, will
become perfectly languid and unaffecting by being
<PB N="348" REF="355"/>
expressed in another. In general, the language is
forcible and moving, when it is such as shows that
the speaker is touched with what he says; this
never fails to affect the hearers. And most of the
figures of rhetoric are nothing else but different
ways of showing this. These figures are fully
treated by the ancient rhetoricians, to whom we
shall refer you. The studying them, and having
all their variety in view, will give you an aptitude
and bent to light upon them, when it is proper to
introduce them. In studying them, it will be pro∣per,
first, to acquire a distinct idea of the nature
of each; and next, to consider what is its real
effect; whether it conduces to perspicuity, to or∣nament,
or to vehemence. Such a previous know∣lege
of them will prevent your introducing them
improperly, and enable you to use with a good
effect those figures which suit the subject and the
occasion. It must be remarked that any appear∣ance
of design in introducing figures, or crowding
them together, must be carefully avoided. If they
do not appear to rise naturally from the subject
and occasion, without being sought for, they will
defeat their own design, and render the discourse
florid, affected, and disagreeable.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="8">
<HEAD>ART. VIII. Of Memory.</HEAD>
<P>The next exertion of mind necessary in a
preacher is memory; the next excercise incumbent
on him is to commit to memory the discourse
<PB N="349" REF="356"/>
which he has invented, composed, and expressed.
In most places it would be unnecessary to attempt
proving that this exercise is incumbent on a public
speaker. To show you, however, that reading is
not approved even by those among whom it is most
used, I shall give you the sentiments of Bishop
Burnet upon it, in his own words. “Reading is
peculiar to this nation, and is endured in no
other. It has indeed made that our sermons
are more exact, and so it has produced us
many volumes of the best that are extant; but
after all, though some few read so happily, pro∣nounce
so truly, and enter so entirely into those
affections which they recommend, that in them
we see both the correctness of reading, and the
seriousness of speaking, sermons, yet every one
is not so happy. Some, by hanging their heads
perpetually over their notes, by blundering as
they read, and by a cursory running over them,
do so lessen the matter of their sermons, that as
they are generally read with very little life or
affection, so they are heard with as little regard
or esteem. Those who read ought certainly
to be at a little more pains than for the most
part they are, to read true, to pronounce with
an emphasis, and to raise their heads, and
direct their eyes to their hearers; and if they
practised more alone the just way of reading,
they might deliver their sermons with much
more advantage. Man is a low sort of creature;
he does not, nay, for the greater part he can∣not,
<PB N="350" REF="357"/>
not, consider things in themselves, without those
little seasonings that must recommend them to
his affections. That a discourse be heard with
any life, it must be spoken with some; and the
looks and motions of the eye do carry in them
such additions to what is said, that where these
do not at all concur, it has not all the force
upon them that otherwise it might have; be∣sides
that the people, who are too apt to censure
the clergy, are easily carried into an obvious
reflection on reading, that it is an effect of
laziness<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Pastoral Care, ch. ix.</NOTE>”</P>
<P>It is easy to see that this writer disapproved read∣ing
sermons much more highly than he thought
proper, on account of its universal prevalence in
England, to declare explicitly. Indeed, the
impropriety of reading sermons arises from the
very principles of human nature, not from any
groundless prejudices. It is not the only design of
language to communicate the ideas of the speaker,
by exciting them in the minds of the hearers; it is
its design likewise to express the sentiments and
affections of the speaker, and by this means to raise
them in the hearers. Reading may answer the first
of these ends, but it is improper for answering the
latter. It is not a natural expression of the speaker's
being interested in what he says; it does not render
<PB N="351" REF="358"/>
the hearers attentive, or contribute to touch or
strike them. It is necessarily weaker, more lan∣guid,
and more unaffecting than speaking.</P>
<P>Were we to inquire at length concerning me∣mory,
we might examine on what the remem∣brance
of single thoughts, and on what the remem∣brance
of their series or connections, depends; and
we might deduce, from the general principles on
which both depend, the means of rendering both
easier. But it will not be necessary for our present
purpose to enter so deep into the matter; it will be
sufficient to make a few general remarks upon
mandating.</P>
<P>In order to perform this exercise easily, it is
proper that the memory be susceptible, so as
quickly to receive what we would commit to it;
distinct, so as to retain not only the things them∣selves,
but likewise their due order or position;
and ready, so as to suggest them without difficulty,
when we have occasion for them. These qualities
of memory are attained by pretty much the same
means. A thorough understanding of the subject
is a great preparation for mandating easily; for it
will enable every part to strike us with greater
force. In order to our remembering, it will like∣wise
be proper that we six close attention upon what
we would remember, without allowing our thoughts
to be distracted or to run off to other subjects,
when we are engaged in mandating. It is also
<PB N="352" REF="359"/>
proper that we dwell on every part till we have
thoroughly acquired it, before we proceed to any
other. If at first we should be able to commit to
memory but a few sentences or periods in a day,
we must take care to acquire them perfectly before
we proceed to others. Order and distinctness in
composition, and even writing a discourse in sepa∣rate
paragraphs, is of great help to memory; it
makes it more easily susceptible, by saving a great
deal of labour that would be necessary for impressing
every single thought, if it were either disposed or
written confusedly; it will make it lie distinctly in
the mind, and give many handles for recollecting
it. When we have looked over what we would
commit to memory, we should endeavour to repeat
it to ourselves; for this endeavour, and looking to
it when we are at a loss, will fix it more speedily,
than if we were to read it over much oftener,
without any attempt to recite; and when we find
ourselves at a loss at any particular place, and, by
looking to it, endeavour to fix it, we shall scarcely
be in any hazard of finding ourselves again at a
loss at that particular place. It is found by some
to be of great service to look over what they want
to remember, immediately before going to sleep at
night, because then the mind is not afterwards
busied about any ideas which may drive it away;
or to look it over in the morning on first getting
up, because the mind is not then pre-occupied with
any ideas which may hinder its taking fast hold of
it. A person ought at first to commit every word
<PB N="353" REF="360"/>
and syllable to heart, whatever trouble it may cost
him; for this will most speedily perfect the habit
of remembering, and make it more easy for him
to remember afterwards, though he only charge
his memory with the principal things and the
general order of the whole. It will be of great
use frequently to recollect and endeavour to repeat
what one has committed to memory, at certain
intervals, before delivering it in public; for a man
cannot at first promise on what he has but lately
committed to memory; but the reviewing of it after
a certain interval fixes it in the memory more
deeply than it was before. These are some of
the principal means of committing discourses to
memory. The frequent use of these means will
beget a habit of doing it easily. No power of the
mind is more improveable by use than memory:
memory is in no way improveable to so great a
degree as in this exercise of mandating. Use
makes it incredibly easy to acquire what we want
to remember; and it produces at the same time so
strong a habit of recollecting readily, that though
one had committed what he is to say very imper∣fectly
to memory, he will run no risk of missing
any part of it. The use you should make of this
is to begin as early as possible to mandate either
sermons or any thing else, and to repeat them
either by yourselves or in the company of others.
By this means the habit will be formed, and all
the difficulties over, before you come to appear in
public.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="361"/>
To many, however, mandating a sermon is a
very difficult matter. Where the memory is natu∣rally
weak, it will take up so much time as to leave
little for any thing else; and even with the best
memory, diffidence and timidity may have such an
effect upon one, as to make him forget, before a
congregation, what he was perfect master of when
alone in his closet. Where it can be done with
tolerable ease, it is certainly most natural; the
preacher will feel it most agreeable; and, in general,
it will have greater influence on the audience. At
the same time one ought to have his notes before
him, to which he may have recourse in case of his
being at a loss; otherwise, if he happen any how to
get discomposed, he may find it difficult to recover
hiniself.</P>
<P>But though mandating be not absolutely neces∣sary
to good preaching, good reading is indispensa∣bly
so. To read servilely, with one's eyes con∣stantly
fixed on his papers, is disgusting to an
audience. It shows something so cold and lifeless
in a preacher, that what he says, be it ever so good
in itself, can never affect his hearers. A preacher
ought always to peruse his sermon till he enter
thoroughly into the spirit of it, and be able, with
a glance at his notes now and then, to deliver it
with facility and propriety. To read well, is an
accomplishment of much greater importance than
many are apt to imagine. It admits of all that
warmth and animation, of all that action which is
<PB N="355" REF="362"/>
necessary or becoming in the pulpit, and will, in
a great measure, supersede the necessity of man∣dating.</P>
</DIV5>
<DIV5 N="9">
<HEAD>ART. IX. Of Pronunciation or Action.</HEAD>
<P>The last exertion employed by the preacher,
and the last part of eloquence, is Pronunciation or
Action. You will find this topic treated largely
by rhetorical writers, and even very minute rules
for the modulation of the voice and the motion of
the several parts of the body given by them, espe∣cially
by Quinctilian. We shall therefore study the
greater brevity. It is acknowleged by all, that the
several languages which have prevailed in the
world are merely artificial, and derive their signifi∣cation
wholly from compact or tacit consent. But
this necessarily supposes that men had previously
a natural language; for without that, they could
never have expressed that consent, or entered into
that compact, from which artificial language derives
its origin. Now, this natural language could be
nothing else but such inarticulate sounds and
motions as naturally expressed the sentiments and
passions of men. The difficulty and scantiness of
these made them inconvenient, and rendered arti∣ficial
language necessary. But they had in some
respects greatly the advantage of this latter. This
of itself expresses only ideas; they expressed all
the movements of the soul; this of itself is dead
and unanimated; they were animated and alive, as
<PB N="356" REF="363"/>
it were. Each of them being thus imperfect by
itself, the perfection of speaking consists in uniting
natural and artificial language as much as possible.
In the union of them, all the rules of pronunciation
and action have their foundation. The natural
inarticulate founds which were in use before lan∣guage
was invented, cannot be mixed with the
articulate founds of which language consists; but
their force is united to them when these articulate
founds are pronounced with the tone and modu∣lation
of voice which correspond to the sentiment
or emotion which they signify. The other part of
natural language, the motions by which men
expressed their sentiments, may be joined with
language, and constitute what is properly termed
Action. Whatever is inconsistent with the union
of natural and artificial language, whatever implies
the mere use of the latter without any mixture of
the former, is a fault in pronunciation. The fol∣lowing
observations may throw some light on this
subject.</P>
<P>Pronunciation includes two parts; the manage∣ment
of the voice, and the gesture of the body. In
general, a great composure of both is absolutely
necessary; a gravity and composure of look and
voice, equally distant from a light careless beha∣viour
on the one hand, and an affected tone and
wry faces on the other. Every thing must be deli∣vered
in such a manner and with such an emphasis,
as may show that the preacher thoroughly under∣stands
<PB N="357" REF="364"/>
all that he says, is fully persuaded of it, and
has those affections which he desires to infuse into
others. The pronunciation must be always distinct,
and the action lively, natural, and becoming, such
as may point out strongly what his words alone
would express in a flat and languid manner. An
orator must not always have his hands or his body
in motion, for it is not natural to use many ges∣tures
when we say common things, without any
vehemence or emotion. Both the voice and the
gesture may have a greater degree of vehemence
in Preaching, than conversation could properly
admit in saying the same things; for the sight of
a great audience, the importance of the subject,
and the solemnity of the occasion, will naturally
give a greater degree of warmth than one could
have in discoursing familiarly with his friends. It
is sometimes proper to express some things with
a less degree of force than their nature would seem
to require, especially when they are to be followed
by things which require the utmost force of pro∣nunciation
and action; for men may waste their
spirits so much in saying plain things, as to be
forced to utter those things faintly which ought to
be delivered with a vehement action; but when
the preacher says things less warm with an easy and
familiar manner, he will the more easily grow ve∣hement,
and attain energy of voice and action
when the subject most requires it; and the audience
will then be most affected. One of the most com∣mon
faults both in voice and action is a monotony
<PB N="358" REF="365"/>
or sameness running through the whole, however
different the sentiments expressed may be. Many
things concur to lead men into this, as their not
having previously studied the varieties of pronun∣ciation,
the difficulty which they find at first in
recollecting readily what they are to say, the being
obliged to speak above the ordinary tone of their
voice in conversation. But it should be carefully
avoided; it appears tolerable when the cant or
tone is harmonious, but it is always improper and
unnatural. When one's words are dictated by
his feelings, he always uses many different gestures
and inflections of the voice, according to the differ∣ent
feelings by which he is actuated. If one
would preach naturally, his voice must assume a
variety of proper tones and inflections, and rise
and fall with a just and easy cadence according to
the nature of the things which he expresses. In
the same way, the action should be varied so as to
suit both the subject and the variations of the
voice. The best way of discovering what is the
tone and gesture suitable to any particular subject,
is to observe those which men have when they are,
undesignedly and without premeditation, engaged
on such a subject. By observing how men speak
and move when they would explain any thing,
you may see what is the tone of voice and gesture
which fits explication. “Observe what is the
posture, and what the voice of one, whose
heart is pierced with sorrow, or surprised at the
sight of an astonishing object; remark the na∣tural
<PB N="359" REF="366"/>
action of the eyes, what the hands do, and
what the whole body;” and where these passions
are concerned, let your manner be the same. It
is necessary that there be no appearance of affect∣ation,
either in the voice or action; and yet,
without endeavour and study at first, it will be
impossible ever to attain a proper manner. The
only course, therefore, that can be taken, is to
employ oneself much in whatever tends to form a
proper manner, before one has occasion to speak
in public, that he may not expose himself to ridi∣cule,
or prevent the effect of the discourse, either
by improprieties, or by an appearance of art and
study. You may begin with observing the va∣rieties
of voice and action described by rhetorical
writers; accustom yourselves to perform each of
them easily and readily; remark which of them
suits every particular subject or passion; frequently
repeat something which gives you an opportunity
of trying them, either by yourselves, or rather,
when you can, in the company of others, who
may observe any improprieties into which you fall.
By frequent exercise in this way, you may acquire,
before you appear in public, such a variety of
graceful pronunciation and action, that when you
are engaged in your subject, you will naturally fall
into what suits it, without any design or thought.</P>
<P>Thus we have considered sermons both with
respect to their kinds and their parts. There are
many observations of great importance which might
<PB N="360" REF="367"/>
be made concerning Preaching, considered in a
moral or practical, rather than a critical view; as,
that sermons ought to convey the truths of reli∣gion
pure and unmixed; in the language of scrip∣ture
as much as possible; in a way suited to the
capacities of the hearers; in a way that is most
likely to promote their reformation; in a way
which shows that the preacher feels himself the
whole force of the truths which he believes. But
we shall not enlarge on these; they are fully treated
in many writings, particularly in some sermons on
this subject, which are well known, and to which
you can have easy access,</P>
<P>When a person is settled in a congregation, it
is proper that in Preaching he should observe some
regular series or order, that all the parts of reli∣gion
may be illustrated in their real connection
and dependence. For, in every science, order in
teaching is absolutely necessary, The plan which
a minister lays down should not be either too short,
else subjects must be treated superficially; or too
long, else the very end of it will be frustrated,
because many of the hearers will not live to see it
completed. There are many different plans into
which a course of sermons may very properly be
digested, some of which may be most agreeable to
one, and others to another, and which the same
man may, for the sake of variety, follow at dif∣ferent
times. Thus, one may follow an historical
order, in which subjects will succeed one another
<PB N="361" REF="368"/>
in some such way as this. The being of God, his
attributes, the creation, the fall and its conse∣quences,
the nature and use of the Jewish dispen∣sation,
the Christian dispensation; the life, death,
and exaltation of our Saviour; the effects of his
mediation, the gospel terms of acceptance, the
various duties of Christianity, death, judgement,
heaven, and hell. I mention this one only as a
specimen, and I mention only the most general
heads. Whatever plan is chosen, the doctrines and
the duties of religion ought to be intermixed with
one another, that their real connection may ap∣pear.</P>
<P>Besides a minister's ordinary course of sermons,
there are occasional discourses which he must
sometimes use, as on fasts and thanksgivings,
about the time of sacraments, at synods, and the
like. These are subject to the very same rules of
composition with other sermons. The matter of
these should always be such as suits the particular
occasion of them, and excites to the practice of
the particular duties which the occasion requires.
And it must be left to the preacher to judge what
appears to him to have these characters. No
doubt some general directions may be given. Thus,
on a public fast, it is proper to give such a view
of the calamity which occasions it, as may excite
the hearers to repentance: on a public thanks∣giving,
such a display of the blessings acknow∣leged
as may inflame their gratitude: on a fast
<PB N="362" REF="369"/>
day before a sacrament, what might either urge
them to repentance, or direct them in the exercise
of it: on a Saturday, or in an action sermon,
what is fit to excite those affections which should
be exerted in commemorating the death of Christ:
in the afternoon or on Monday, what may con∣firm
their good impressions, and persuade them to
the practice of holiness.</P>
<P>There is one thing more that will deserve to be
taken notice of on the subject of Preaching; whe∣ther
writing discourses regularly, or Preaching on
mere premeditation, be the preferable way. This
latter way has been warmly recommended by two
writers on the subject of Preaching, Bishop Burnet
in his Pastoral Care, and the Archbishop of Cam∣bray
in his Dialogues concerning eloquence. They
propose that a man should be at great pains to
prepare himself for Preaching without writing, for
several years before he attempt it, by acquiring
great knowlege of the scriptures, by comparing
together those passages which belong to the same
subject; by often laying them together, and di∣gesting
in his thoughts what arises from them upon
any subject; by acquiring a distinct and connected
idea of the whole body of divinity, and by furnish∣ing
his mind with a large collection of sentiments
from practical writers upon all kinds of subjects.
Being provided with these materials, in order to
qualify himself for this way of Preaching, he must
accustom himself to talk freely to himself, and let
<PB N="363" REF="370"/>
his thoughts flow easily from him; he must fre∣quently
write on all sorts of subjects, that he may
bring himself to correctness both in thinking and
speaking; he must for some years accustom himself
to preach as it were to himself on all sorts of sub∣jects
once or twice every day, that he may acquire
an easiness both of thought and of expression;
above all, he must have in himself a deep sense of
the truth and power of religion, and must, by
meditation and prayer, draw down divine influ∣ences,
which are always to be expected when a
man puts himself in the way of them, and prepares
himself for them. This preparation will enable
him to pour out true thoughts in just and easy
expressions. But even after all this preparation,
he must at first try smaller excursions from his
fixed thoughts; and as he succeeds in these, he
may give himself farther scope; and so, by long
practice, he will at last arrive at so great an easi∣ness
both in thinking and speaking, that a very
little meditation will serve him for preparing a
sermon. If one be to try Preaching in this way,
it is necessary that he meditate so carefully on his
subject beforehand, as to have a distinct and com∣prehensive
view of it, as to reduce his thoughts
into proper method, as to have thought of the
strongest expressions and figures. It is supposed
that in this way he must have a great advantage
in the freedom and force of his pronunciation and
action; he will speak in an easy, unaffected way,
<PB N="364" REF="371"/>
and not like a formal declaimer; he can vary his
discourse according to the occasions which cast up
while he is delivering it.</P>
<P>In my opinion, these writers have carried the
matter too far. It is very proper that a man
should be able to preach in the way they recom∣mend,
when it is necessary; but no man ought
always to preach in this way. If he do, he will
run into trite common-place topics; his compo∣sitions
will be loose and unconnected; his lan∣guage
often coarse or confused; and diffidence, or
care to recollect his subject, will destroy the ma∣nagement
of his voice. At any rate, a person
should accustom himself to compose regular dis∣courses
for many years after he begins to preach,
before he attempt this method, except in short
excursions, or when absolute necessity requires it.</P>
<P>It is the design of all the discourses that are
prescribed here, to prepare you for the business of
Preaching. In order to their doing so, it is best
that you compose just such lectures and sermons
as should be delivered in public; that you imagine
yourselves preaching to a congregation, and make
your sentiments, your method, your language,
your pronunciation, and your action, precisely such
as you would think proper for a popular audience.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of presiding in the ordinary Public Worship of God,
administering the Sacraments, and conducting
Public Worship on extraordinary occasions.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already considered the several private
duties of the pastoral office, and we have largely
explained Preaching, which is the first public duty
of this office that we took notice of. The other
public duties incumbent on a minister, which pecu∣liarly
regard the parish in which he is settled, may
be reduced to these: Presiding in the ordinary
public worship of God, administering the sacra∣ments,
and conducting public worship on extra∣ordinary
occasions. In explaining these as duties
of the pastoral office, it would be superfluous to
attempt a large explication of the nature of prayer
or of the sacraments. In the view which we here
take of them, it will be sufficient to make such
observations as tend to show how a minister may
perform with propriety his particular part in these
sacred offices.</P>
<P>In the primitive church, the manner in which
public worship was conducted seems to have been
this. “When the congregation was assembled,
the first act of divine service which they per∣formed
was reading the scriptures. When the
reading of the scriptures was ended, then fol∣lowed
the singing of psalms, either such as
<PB N="366" REF="373"/>
were taken out of the scriptures, or such hymns
as were composed by any of themselves; and
these they were always careful to sing <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
in good tune and concert. When the
singing of psalms was ended, then succeeded
the preaching of the word. As soon as the
sermon was ended, then all the congregation rose
up to present their common and public prayers
to God, strétching out their hands, and lifting
up their eyes to Heaven, and the minister with
a modest and supplicating voice presented, in
the name of the congregation, prayers suited to
their present circumstances.” The manner of
public worship prescribed by the directory of our
church coincides, in almost every material circum∣stance,
with this, which was observed in the
church at least for three centuries. It appoints
that, the congregation being assembled, the mi∣nister
should begin with a short prayer, impressing
them with a sense of the divine presence, and
begging God's assistance and acceptance. Next,
the scriptures are to be read in their order. Then
psalms are to be sung. After this, the minister is
again to pray. Preaching succeeds this prayer.
The sermon being ended, the minister is again to
pray. After prayer, a psalm is to be sung, and
then the minister is to dismiss the congregation with
a solemn blessing.</P>
<P>Of these parts, preaching has been already
considered; reading the scriptures has somehow
gone into disuse; perhaps it has been insensibly
<PB N="367" REF="374"/>
jostled out by lecturing; sometimes a chapter
which was read, would require some observations
for explaining it; and from making these after it
had been read, men, at first perhaps conceited of
their own abilities, and fond of speaking, came by
degrees to comment on every piece of scripture
which they read, till at last the very notion of a
lecture's being intended chiefly for reading a piece
of scripture is wholly lost. Reading the scriptures
seems to be so necessary and essential a part of
Christian worship, that the omission of it is the
most faulty defect in the present practice of our
church. Yet so great is the perverseness and
weak bigotry of many, that in some places it
would almost create a schism to attempt to intro∣duce
it; and even the authority of our directory,
framed in the revered ages of the church, would
not be sufficient to secure from blame the person
who introduced it. I know nothing, however,
which better deserves a man's running the risk of
giving offence, than restoring the public reading of
the scriptures. In some places it might perhaps be
attempted without offence, and there it should be
attempted. It might perhaps, in most places, be
introduced gradually, by lecturing on large por∣tions
of scripture, first making the explication
shorter than ordinary, then passing over some of
the easier verses without any explication; then
explaining only a few of the most difficult verses;
and afterwards, reading a whole chapter, and
only subjoining some practical observations upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="375"/>
The only part that remains of ordinary public
worship, on which it will be necessary to make
any observations for directing the minister in the
part he is to act in it, is prayer. In churches
where composed liturgies are used, a minister has
nothing to do but to read their prayers; he need
only study to pronounce them with gravity and
affection, and with a due slowness and emphasis,
which will be most effectually attained by bringing
his mind to an inward and feeling sense of those
things that are prayed for. But in our church,
where no liturgy is imposed, a great deal depends
on the minister, and, therefore he ought to be at
the greatest pains to fit himself for performing this
important part of worship in a proper manner. It
would be foreign to our present design to consider
the point of imposed liturgies as a theological
question. But it may prepare the way for some of
the observations which we are to make concerning
public prayer, to begin with observing, that both
established forms of prayer and the total want of
them have some advantages and some inconve∣niences.
When public forms are appointed, the
people may be supposed to know more perfectly
what are the devotions in which they are to join,
to have a better opportunity of bringing them∣selves
beforehand to the temper which suits them,
and may enable them to join with sincerity in
them. They may likewise be carefully drawn up
by persons of abilities, and may thus prevent many
absurdities into which weak and ignorant ministers,
<PB N="369" REF="376"/>
trusting wholly to their own gifts, may sometimes
run. But it must be acknowleged, on the other
hand, that when set forms are imposed, they can∣not
be so exactly suited to particular circumstances
and emergencies as might be wished: they must
be gone over so often that they become tiresome
and disgusting, or at least unaffecting both to the
minister and to the people, and, by thus degene∣rating
into mere form, prevent all the good effect
which might result from a previous acquaintance
with them. Praying without set forms may, doubt∣less
too, be productive of some inconveniences.
Thus, when the audience know that the prayers
are the performance of the preacher himself, they
are too apt to consider them as a specimen of his
abilities, to attend to them with a view to form a
judgement of his talents, and thus to be diverted
from expressing their devotion in the words that
he uses, which ought to be their only employ∣ment.
This appears to me to be the inconvenience
which is most inseparable from public prayer with∣out
established forms. The best means of curing
it will be, frequently to inculcate the necessity of
joining heartily in prayer, and to contrive his
prayers so that they may be fit to affect them with
devotion, and to raise their minds in the exercise of
it. It might however, without the imposition of
forms, be effectually remedied by a proper direc∣tory
(such as our own is in some measure), con∣taining
either a variety of forms, any of which
might be used, or a large collection of materials
<PB N="370" REF="377"/>
for prayer, out of which a choice may be made,
put into the hands of the people, recommended to
their study, and rendered by this means sufficiently
known to them. The other inconveniencies which
are sometimes imputed to prayer without set forms,
really arise from faults in the manner of performing
it, and will be avoided by ministers taking care to
perform it in a proper manner.</P>
<P>Thus it is said that the people cannot join in
prayer, of which they know nothing beforehand,
and into which the preacher may perhaps throw
peculiar sentiments of his own, in which the con∣gregation
do not agree with him. But this ob∣jection
can lie only against prayers which are very
ill contrived. The proper matter of prayer all are
acquainted with, and can join in, and none are
wholly ignorant of the language in which it may be
most fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly expressed. The minister, while he con∣fines
himself to the proper subject of prayer, can
have no occasion to throw in peculiar sentiments of
his own. In public prayers, he should confine
himself to those expressions of adoration, thanks∣giving,
confession, and petition, which are appli∣cable
to all, and might with propriety come from
the mouth of any of the congregation. Peculiari∣ties
are proper for private devotions, not for
public. Every part of public prayer ought, as
much as possible, to be expressed in the language of
scripture, which is both the most weighty in itself,
and the most familiar to the congregation. When
<PB N="371" REF="378"/>
other expressions are mixed with it, they ought to
be as plain and simple as possible. Pompous,
affected, and obscure expressions are wholly im∣proper
for devotion. When the proper matter of
prayer is thus kept to and expressed, all may bring
themselves to a fit temper for joining sincerely in it
as easily as if they knew the whole composition
beforehand, and at the same time they are freed
from the deadness and coldness which the constant
use of established forms is apt to produce.</P>
<P>If persons not restrained to imposed forms ever
run into absurdities for want of them, it is owing
not to the use of extemporary prayer itself, but to
a wrong manner in using it. Because established
forms of prayer are not publicly imposed, it does
not therefore follow that arbitrary forms may not
be used; that a minister may not himself compose
or collect forms proper for the different occasions
on which he is to use them. Because a minister is
not obliged to read a liturgy prescribed by autho∣rity,
it does not therefore follow that he is to pour
out such petitions or devotions as occur to him,
without any method, choice, or premeditation.
On the contrary, we ought to be as careful about
what we say in prayer, as about what we say in
preaching, as solicitous to speak with propriety
when we address ourselves to God, as when we
address the congregation. When a person first
begins to appear in public, it will be very proper
that he prepare his prayers with as great care and
<PB N="372" REF="379"/>
regularity as his sermons. It will likewise begenerally
proper, when any particular or public occasion
demands a considerable peculiarity in the subject or
manner of prayer, to compose devotions suited to
it. By this means, a preacher of moderate under∣standing
will be able to avoid every thing unbecom∣ing
in prayer, and to perform it with greater pro∣priety,
and so as to raise more servent devotion
both in himself and in others, than by going over
public forms. If a person compose a variety of
prayers in this way, and become thoroughly master
of them, he will soon be furnished with such
abundance of materials for prayer, that he can
easily perform this part of public worship after∣wards,
without the necessity of either composing a
distinct form of prayer for every occasion, or
recurring constantly upon the same form or the
same expressions; but mixing together and dis∣posing
in different manners, according to the
present impulse of his mind or the nature of the
occasion, those petitions and devotions which he
had formerly digested into several distinct prayers.
There is another way which a preacher may take,
and which he should superadd to the former, for
forming himself to a readiness, a copiousness and
variety in public prayer. He should collect toge∣ther,
and write down, such proper adorations,
expressions of praise, petitions, and acknowlege∣ments,
as he meets with, particularly in reading
the scriptures; he should write them down in any
order in which they occur. By this means he will
<PB N="373" REF="380"/>
in a short time obtain a large stock, and by fre∣quently
looking it over and fixing it in his mind,
the several things which he has written down will
occur to him readily when he has occasion for
them, without his needing to digest them into form
before-hand; one thing will suggest another con∣nected
with it; and the disposition of his prayers,
dictated in this manner by the present temper of
his mind, will be more easy and natural, and will
render them more striking and affecting, than if it
had been contrived coolly in his closet.</P>
<P>Most other observations which might be made
concerning public prayer, regard it rather as a
Christian duty, than the peculiar part which a
minister has in it by presiding in the public worship.
There is one, however, that we may briefly touch
upon, the order in which the parts of prayer may
be most properly disposed. This may, no doubt,
be different, and the proportion of time allowed
to each will vary according to different occasions.
In general, adoration is proper in the beginning,
to strike us with a sense of the Divine Presence,
and to excite, by the contemplation of God's per∣fections,
those pious and devout affections which
should prevail in the mind when it is engaged in
prayer. From adoration, the transition to praise
and thanksgiving is extremely easy and natural.
Thanksgiving will be very properly succeeded by
petitions for mercy, and, as connected with these,
by confession of sin and expressions of repentance.
<PB N="374" REF="381"/>
Petitions, not only for the direction and assistance
of God's spirit, but likewise for all good things
to ourselves and others, will be very properly in∣troduced
by these. But, in fact, there is no ne∣cessity
for keeping these several parts distinct. It
is better to intermix them through the whole of
prayer. This is the most ordinary method in the
devotional parts of scripture, which are the best
models we can follow. It is the most natural ex∣pression
of a mind possessed by devotion, and ac∣tuated
by piety. It gives fuller scope for express∣ing
all the variety of affections which are combined
in a pious temper. Indeed, though those which
we have mentioned are commonly reckoned all the
parts of devotion, yet there are some affections
which it is extremely proper to exert in devotion,
that are not properly reducible to any of them.
Such are expressions of our trust in God, of our
resignation to his will, of our good resolutions, of
our regard to God's judgement of us, of our
delight in him, of our sense of the beauty and
excellence of holiness; these are rather implied or
supposed in some of the parts of prayer, than
explicitly contained in them. But, by considering
prayer, not as composed of so many parts which
should succeed each other in order, but as an
exertion and expression of a pious and holy temper,
we may very properly introduce the expressions
of all its branches, not confusedly, yet so as not
to be scrupulous in keeping them separate and
distinct.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="382"/>
The next public duty of the pastoral office is
the administration of the Christian sacraments.
These are two, Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
which we shall consider briefly, not in every view
that might be taken of them, but simply in this
one view of its being a part of a minister's function
to dispense them in such a way as to render them
most useful to Christians.</P>
<P>To begin with Baptism. It is very necessary
that a minister instruct his people frequently con∣cerning
the nature of baptism, that they may not
go about it as a ceremony, as it is too visible the
greater part do, but that they may attend to its
real design and importance. As it is very proper
to instruct parents in this privately when they
desire to have their children baptised, so no time
is more suitable for instructing the congregation
publicly concerning it, than when it is to be dis∣pensed.
As it is not convenient to make long
discourses on these occasions, it will be proper to
confine oneself to some one view of it at each
time. And it may be considered in many differ∣ent
views, each of which will convey a striking
conception of its nature and use. It will be unne∣cessary
to go over all these views; every place of
scripture almost in which it is mentioned, sets it
in a light somewhat peculiar. To give a few in∣stances
of the different lights in which it may be
set. At one time it may be very proper to point
out the foundation of ritual duties in our mixed
<PB N="376" REF="383"/>
and compounded natures, their necessity. for ex∣citing
us to holiness by such ceremonies as strike
the senses, the proneness of men in all ages to
abuse them, and to substitute them in the place of
true goodness, the care of our Saviour to prevent
this by the simplicity apd significance of his posi∣tive
institutions, and particularly of baptism. At
another time, one may enlarge on its being an in∣stitution
of our Saviour, and therefore, its de∣serving
our closest attention to the real design and
intention of it. Sometimes one may represent it
as the sign of our believing the truths of the gospel
and receiving its precepts, from our Saviour com∣manding
his disciples tp baptise men in the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and
to teach men at the same time to observe all things
whatsoever he had commanded them. At other
times it may be represented as, both by the de∣clarations
of scripture and the original manner of
dispensing it, an emblem of a spiritual death and
resurrection. Sometimes it may be represented
as the seal of those religious privileges which God
has freely bestowed on the Christian church as
means of holiness and improvement, as admitting
those who are baptised, to them, and as, a sign of
the obligation which the enjoyment of these pri∣vileges
lays us under to the practice of holiness.
At other times it may be represented as a stipu∣lation
to walk worthy of the Christian vocation;
which it is of great importance to fulfil so as to
preserve a good conscience. Many different views
<PB N="377" REF="384"/>
of it will occur by careful attention to its nature,
and to the several places of scripture relating to it.
It will generally be sufficient to give one of these
views of it at once. But whatever view of it be
given, it should be made to issue in urging all pre∣sent
to walk suitably to their Christian profession,
and inculcating on them the necessity of holiness.</P>
<P>As in the first ages of the gospel, when the
persons baptised were adult, they were obliged at
their baptism to profess that they believed the go∣spel
of Christ, were willing to engage in the pro∣fession
of it, and resolved to walk worthy of this
profession; so now, when infants are baptised, it
is proper that some professions and stipulations
should be exacted from their parents or sponsors.
It is proper that they mould be obliged to make
public profession of their own belief of the gospel.
This profession ought to be confined to the funda∣mental
and uncontroverted truths of religion, and
not extended to any of the distinguishing tenets of
a party; for baptism is an institution of Jesus, not
of any leader of a sect; it is the sign of our ad∣mission
into the Christian church, not of our ad∣mission
into any particular division of Christians.
It is likewise proper to exact an engagement from
the parents or sponsors, to instruct the child in the
whole doctrine of the gospel, in the import of its
having been baptised, and to fulfil their obligations
to take care of its education.</P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="385"/>
Both the propriety of the thing itself, and the
constant and universal practice of the Christian
church requires that the exacting of these pro∣fessions
and engagements should be followed by
prayer and invocation of God, which, on this oc∣casion,
may very properly consist in acknowlege∣ments
of God's goodness, particularly in the go∣spel,
in the continuance of it from one generation
to another, in making us and our children par∣takers
in his covenant, in his freely bestowing
upon us our Christian privileges, in his appointing
this sensible action as a sign of our being invested
with them, and in petitions that he may bless his
own ordinance of baptism at the time, that he may
join the inward baptism of his spirit with the out∣ward
baptism of water, that the washing with water
may not be an empty ceremony to the child, but
may be followed by that purity of heart and life,
of which it is designed to be only a type and re∣presentation.</P>
<P>When the blessing of God is, in some such way
as this, implored on his institution, baptism itself is
performed by sprinkling, along with a repetition
of the words of institution.</P>
<P>The dispensing of baptism is very properly fol∣lowed
by prayer, that it may be rendered effectual
to the salvation of the child, that it may be fol∣lowed
by sanctification and remission of sins, that
the child, now a member of the Christian church
<PB N="379" REF="386"/>
and admitted to the outward privileges of the
gospel, may become a member of God's true in∣visible
church, and be received into the enjoyment
of the eternal blessings of the gospel, that the pa∣rents
may be enabled to perform their duty to
their child and family, and all the duties incum∣bent
on them, and that all present may walk
worthy of their holy vocation; and to these prayers
suited to the institution, any of the proper mate∣rials
of devotion may be added as occasion re∣quires.</P>
<P>The rules and practice regarding the circum∣stances
in which any alteration is to be made in
any of the ordinary methods of dispensing bap∣tism,
are so well established, that it will not be
necessary to enlarge upon them. Some cases of
difficulty may, no doubt, occur; but as these can∣not
be foreseen or enumerated, it must be left to
a man's own prudence and the best advice he can
obtain, to direct him in these cases.</P>
<P>The other Christian sacrament is the Lord's
Supper. It is very necessary to explain properly
the nature of this institution, both in preaching
and in private, that the people may be guarded
against the two extremes of irreverence and super∣stition.
This is a part of teaching; but we are
at present to consider this sacrament only in the
view of dispensing it in such a way, that it may
tend most to the end for which it was designed,
<PB N="380" REF="387"/>
the promoting of true holiness and goodness. All
who profess Christianity are not to be promiseu∣ously
admitted to it. They who are either grossly
ignorant, or openly and customarily vicious in any
particular way, act unsuitably to the common pro∣fession
of Christianity; and nothing could tend
more to bring this solemn act of worship into con∣tempt,
than to admit these to it, who, it is plain,
could not perform it acceptably. At the same
time, one should avoid the other extreme of too
great rigour and, severity in excluding persons on
account of those faults, which may be resolved
into the weakness of the present state, and may be
consistent with sincere goodness. The proper light
in which it should be considered is, that it is a
means of improvement, but at the same time a
means of improvement which cannot be used to
advantage, except by those who have already some
degree of good dispositions. In this view of it, it
is plainly absurd to require so great a degree of
perfection in those who are admitted to it, that, if
they were possessed of that degree, they could
scarce need means of improvement. And, on the
other hand, it is wrong to receive those who can
evidently exert no good affections in it, and there∣fore
cannot be improved by the use of it. A mi∣nister,
by considering i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this light, and regu∣lating
his conduct by this view of it, may take
several advantages from this sacrament for making
good impressions on the people. Thus, about the
time of a communion, every minister that knows
<PB N="381" REF="388"/>
any one of his parish guilty of eminent sins, may
go to him, and admonish him to change his course
of life, or not to profane the table of the Lord.
When a person designs first to partake in the
Lord's Supper, a minister may make good im∣pressions
on the person himself and on others, by
making him not only in private, but in as public
a manner as he finds it convenient to use, to make
solemn profession of his embracing the Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
faith for himself, and to vow that he will live suit∣ably
to it, renouncing the sins which he has for∣merly
indulged, and promising to live henceforth
as becomes a Christian. This is practised by some
ministers with good success, and with a very great
effect.</P>
<P>When the actual dispensing of this sacrament comes
on, the first part of the service is, what is called
fencing the tables; that is, describing those who are
unfit for this part of worship, and those who are
fit. In doing this, care should be taken to require
no qualifications which are not absolutely required
by the scriptures. All unbelievers and all wicked
persons should be declared unworthy; but no
minister, except he can show a revelation from
Heaven, declaring his explications of scripture to
be infallibly true, has a right to declare any person
unworthy on account of such errors in judgement as
are consistent with a sincere belief of Christianity.
This institution is the test of Christians, not of any
<PB N="382" REF="389"/>
one sect; it is the bond of Christian love, not of
division and schism.</P>
<P>Again, a minister should warn them who are
unworthy, in such a manner as may show, in the
most obvious way, that his warnings are not arbi∣trary,
that he does not merely speak from his own
opinion or humour; in such a manner as may
carry conviction with it, that the several characters
which he describes do necessarily, in their very
nature, render persons unfit for this act of worship.
The easiest and most effectual way of answering
this end seems to be, along with every character
that is described, to point the reason why, or to
express in what manner, it renders those to whom
it belongs unworthy. Thus, in general, the neces∣sity
of some preparation and previous good dispo∣sition
of heart arises from this, that external acts
of worship can improve the temper only by their
being exertions of the good affections from which
they proceed, and therefore cannot at all improve
those who have not some degree of these affections,
and of consequence cannot exert them, or put
them in exercise; and the matter may be repre∣sented
in this light by the minister. When atheists
are excluded, the obvious reason may be hinted,
that they cannot join in an act of religious worship;
when deists, that they cannot join in a christian
institution. When the vices forbidden in the third
commandment are mentioned, it may be hinted
<PB N="383" REF="390"/>
that they are inconsistent with that reverence of
God which suits so solemn an approach to him.
The vices forbidden in the fourth commandment
show a want or a weakness of devout affections,
and therefore unfit men for this institution, in
which devout affections should be raised to the
highest pitch of fervency; and so in other instances.
Proceeding in this way will give great weight to
all that a minister says in this part of the service,
will render it convincing, and keep it from being
in any measure regarded as a mere form.</P>
<P>In declaring who are fit for this act of worship,
a minister's view should be, not only to declare, in
as plain terms as possible, what are the characters
that render one a good man and a true Christian,
or at least, in such a disposition of repentance as
will render this act of worship acceptable, but also
to remove the grounds of fear which weak or
melancholy persons are apt to dwell upon, from
reflection on the present state of their minds,
their want of warmth of devotion, their being
distracted with idle thoughts, or their not having
found time for such particular preparation as they
would have chosen.</P>
<P>As the whole office of a clergyman is properly
ministerial, not lordly or dictatorial, so in this ser∣vice
in particular, it seems to be more suitable to
this character of his office to express his warnings
as declarations of the necessary qualifications of
<PB N="384" REF="391"/>
communicants, by which they may examine and
judge themselves, than to affect the authority and
solemnity which are sometimes used, of repeating
continually, “I debar and exclude,” or “I invite
in the name of Christ.”</P>
<P>After this part of the service is over, as this
sacrament is a positive institution, not of natural
obligation, but deriving its obligation solely from
its being appointed in scripture, the institution
should be read from some of the places of scripture
where it is recorded. The reading of it should be
followed by prayer, which will properly consist of
two parts, thanksgiving for the blessings of the
gospel, and petitions for God's blessing on the
institution, for his grace to excite and enliven all
the devout affections which should be exerted in
it, and for his assistance to perform our vows,
and practise all the duties of life to which they
bind us. This prayer, which should be contrived,
as much as possible, to express and excite sincere
and servent devotion, may be very properly followed
by giving such a view of the nature of the institu∣tion,
as may dispose both to a rational and to a
devout observance of it.</P>
<P>After this is over, it would be extremely decent,
that, except the minister's distributing the elements
with the words used by our Saviour, all the rest
were performed in solemn silence. And this is, in
fact, the method prescribed by our directory.
<PB N="385" REF="392"/>
But custom has introduced discourses at every
table. These are attended with this inconvenience,
that they employ the communicants too much in
hearing, and divert them from what is their proper
business, internal devotion. Since they are used
they ought therefore at least to be contrived so as
to produce this inconvenience as little as possible.
Set discourses, calculated for information, are
always improper. The part of the discourse which
precedes the distribution of the elements should be
employed in giving some striking view of the love
of God in Christ, tending directly to inflame the
affections which ought to be exercised. The dis∣course
should not be continued after the elements
are received; the minister should either preserve
absolute silence, or throw in only such short hints
as may direct and animate the devotion of the
communicants; any thing further interrupts en∣tirely
the exercise of devotion, which should
employ them. The remaining part of the dis∣course
will be properly employed in such warm
exhortations, striking sentiments, and practical
maxims and directions, as may make an impres∣sion
on them, and influence their conduct.</P>
<P>After all have communicated, there generally is,
and very properly may be, an address or exhort∣ation.
For this, there are several very sit topics.
The most common way is to give a description
of the different characters of communicants, by
which they may know how far their temper has
<PB N="386" REF="393"/>
been right or faulty, and exhortations suited to
the variety of their tempers. And if this be done
with judgement, and with a fixed view to habitual
practice, it may be very useful. Another proper
topic may be, to rectify men's mistakes about the
advantages to be expected from this sacrament,
in immediate and sensible illuminations or conso∣lations,
to direct them to judge of their advantage
by their after-conduct, and to improve their com∣munication
by a holy life. Or a minister may
urge upon them the obligations which Christianity,
and particularly which this public profession of
it, lays them under, to virtue and holiness. In a
word, whatever has a tendency either to persuade
or to direct them to a becoming conduct, is a very
proper topic.</P>
<P>In general, great care is necessary in every thing
that is said about this sacrament, to avoid mystical
and unmeaning expressions, to use no word which
does not convey a distinct and rational conception,
and to direct the whole to practice. Most men's
minds are, at this time, peculiarly susceptible of
good impressions; and a minister should seize this
favourable opportunity of fixing in them something
practical, something moral, something fit to enter
into their temper, and regulate their life.</P>
<P>As to the worship of God on extraordinary occa∣sions,
we have already taken some notice of the
peculiarities of sermons suited to them. And,
<PB N="387" REF="394"/>
with regard to conducting public devotion on them,
it will be sufficient to observe, that the subject of
the devotion should be suited to the particular
occasion; that for this end, the greatest propor∣tion
of time should be allowed to that part of devo∣tion
which most suits the occasion; as to confession
on fasts, to praise on thanksgivings; and that, in
general, it may be proper to spend more time in
devotion than on ordinary occasions.</P>

<PB N="388" REF="395"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ecclesiastical Duties respecting the Church in
general.</HEAD>
<P>THE public duties of the pastoral office, which
have been hitherto considered, are incumbent
on a minister as pastor of a particular parish, and
regard all the congregation under his care. But,
besides these, there are other duties of a still more
public nature, which are incumbent on him as
a member of the church in general, and which
do not immediately or necessarily respect the parish
committed to his care. These we shall briefly
consider.</P>
<P>We shall begin with a part of the pastoral
office, which is indeed often exercised by a minister
in his own parish, but which we have chosen to
consider under this head, because it is often also
exercised by him in a more public capacity, and
without any immediate reference to his own parish,
and because it bears some relation to the other
duties which regard the government of the church;
I mean the exercise of public discipline.</P>
<P>We have already considered the several private
ways of checking or rebuking wickedness, which
<PB N="389" REF="396"/>
a minister may, and ought to use. But private
rebukes are not sufficient in all cases; the apostle
Paul expressly commands Timothy, in some cases,
to “rebuke them that sin before all, that others
also may fear<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 20.</NOTE>.” And our Saviour directs our
conduct in this matter: “If thy brother shall
trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault
between thee and him alone: if he shall hear
thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he
will not hear thee, then take with thee one or
two more, that in the mouth of two or three
witnesses every word may be established. And
if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the
church: but if he neglect to hear the church,
let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a
publican<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Matt. xviii. 15, &amp;.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>In the first ages of the church, the discipline
was extremely strict, much stricter than the temper
of the present age will permit. And though the
greatest care should be taken not to slacken disci∣pline
more than absolute necessity requires, yet
prudence forbids to stretch it farther than the
situation of things will bear; for attempts to do so,
by proving ineffectual, will disappoint their own
design, and make the spiritual arms of the church
even more despised than they were before.</P>
<P><PB N="390" REF="397"/>
Every thing essential to the manner of exer∣cising
discipline is prescribed in the form of process
established by authority, which is composed with a
spirit of moderation and good sense perfectly incon∣sistent
with that inquisitorial spirit which some are
disposed to exert in discipline. An acquaintance
with the rules which are there prescribed is abso∣lutely
necessary for every minister, in order to
secure him from blunders in appointing censures.
And the rules of procedure being there fully laid
down, renders it only necessary here to make a
few general observations, which may be of use for
directing you to apply the rules with prudence and
judgement.</P>
<P>All sins require repentance, and repentance will
always show itself by obvious and open effects;
but all sins are not the proper objects of church
discipline. Christian charity will not allow us to
pry into the secret faults of others; it is only their
open and public sins that give scandal, and deserve
public animadversions. All open and public sins
are in themselves proper objects of discipline; yet
all of them cannot be easily brought under disci∣pline.
Some of them do not show themselves by
overt and determinate acts; they do not admit of
definite measures. It is not easy to fix the limits
where the lawful ends and the unlawful begins.
On this account they cannot easily be censured
publicly, for it is not easy to prove that persons
are guilty of them; and to inflict censures in cases
<PB N="391" REF="398"/>
which do not admit determinate and satisfactory
proof, would open a door to tyranny and op∣pression.
For the same reason, many vices which
display themselves in determinate and overt acts,
cannot, in all cases, be easily subjected to public
censure, because they cannot be fully proved.
These causes have reduced the vices which are now
publicly censured to a very narrow compass, to
such as discover themselves by effects perfectly un∣questionable
and free from all ambiguity. Yet
even these are more than are generally subjected to
the exercise of discipline, as swearing, some in∣stances
of drunkenness, many cases of lying, dis∣honesty,
and calumny, and many overt acts of
impiety. All such sins, which are both open and
capable of legal proof, ought, doubtless, to be
much more subjected to discipline than they are,
for they are properly scandalous. But it will not
be prudent to attempt the exercise of discipiine
against sins, to which these characters do not agree.
In ages when a sense of religion prevails, they who
have fallen into sin may, from a true disposition
of penitence, be ready to acknowlege it when they
are accused, and to make all the reparation in
their power for the scandal they have given. But
that is not the temper of the present age; men
will acknowlege nothing which cannot be proved
against them. In this situa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inn, all that can be
done is to extend the exercise of church discipline
uniformly against those sins which can be clearly
<PB N="392" REF="399"/>
proved, and to attempt only private admonitions
or reprooss against other sins.</P>
<P>The abuses of the Popish church have intro∣duced
an inveterate and deep-rooted mistake,
which it will not be easy to eradicate, that sub∣mission
to church censures is a sort of penance
which expiates the guilt of the sin. All methods
should be taken to remove this error, and to in∣culcate
that they are only spiritual chastisements
designed to increase true repentance, and to ex∣press
it, and that no farther than they do so, can
they be of any avail for obtaining pardon. In
inflicting censures, a minister should carefully re∣member
that he is a judge, and should therefore
preserve perfect impartiality and strict justice. It
is particularly base to make the power entrusted
to him in any degree an instrument of his own re∣sentment.
If he bear any grudge at a person
whose conduct exposes him to public censure, it
would be much better to decline, as much as possi∣ble,
any share in judging of it, in order to avoid
even the suspicion of partiality. All discipline
ought to be managed in such a way as may tend
most to promote true virtue; and in order to this,
it should always be directed by prudence, joined
with a spirit of meekness.</P>
<P>In almost all the public duties which are incum∣bent
on a clergyman as a member of the church
<PB N="393" REF="400"/>
in general, he acts the part of a judge, and there∣fore
ought to be careful to maintain the character
of a judge, the peculiar decorum of which is strict
and inflexible integrity. Here indeed, all extremes
are to be avoided. We must not, by studying to
be impartial, become rigid or severe; nor, in
avoiding rigour, ought we to swerve from inte∣grity.
We must be strict, yet not captious; un∣biassed,
yet not rigorous; meek, yet not remiss.</P>
<P>The subjects of judgement which principally
come before ministers as members of judicatories,
(besides cases of discipline,) are two; the decision
of settlements, and the qualifications of candidates
for the ministry. It will not be improper to
make a few observations on these separately,
because there are some circumstances peculiar to
each.</P>
<P>In questions concerning settlements, the property
and rights of men are as truly concerned, as in any
questions that are brought before a civil judge.
An honest man can have no more scope for favour
in cases of this sort, than a civil judge can have in
trials for life and property. It cannot fail to be a
great reproach to a clergyman to be thought more
open to solicitations than any other judge. Yet it
has somehow happened, that they who would never
think of soliciting a civil judge in a cause depending
before him, make no scruple to solicit clergymen
with regard to causes depending before church
<PB N="394" REF="401"/>
judicatories, and imagine they have a right to be
offended with a person, and to resent it, if he
refuse to give his voice as they require. Clergy-men
have given too great countenance to this
shameful practice, by listening to solicitations, by
yielding to them, by not expressing sufficient indig∣nation
against them, by not remembering that it is
incumbent on them to sustain the integrity and
inflexibility of the judge. One circumstance has
greatly contributed to this; the laws of the church
regarding settlements have scarcely ever been fixed
and determinate; and this has led not only clergymen,
but all others concerned in church judicatories,
to assume a liberty, and to think that they
might allow themselves a great latitude in determining
according to circumstances in any particular
case; and partiality or attachment easily made them
conceive circumstances in the most favourable
light for that side which they were disposed to
espouse. This cannot excuse the conduct; for
the assuming this liberty evidently tended to make
every thing loose and uncertain; and it is reproachful
to any court to be guided by no fixed principles.
In this situation, it was plainly incumbent
on every clergyman to lay down a settled rule of
judgement for himself, and to adhere to it uni∣formly
till he found a better, for which he might
exchange it in all cases. He ought not to hearken
to solicitations; if they are made by persons to
whom he lies under obligations, he may profess
his readiness to oblige them in every way in his
<PB N="395" REF="402"/>
power, but at the same time tell them resolutely,
that in questions before a judicatory he considers
himself as a judge, and must be determined solely
by the merits of the cause. By whomsoever he
be solicited, he may declare his readiness to receive
information of any facts on which the cause
depends, but express a firm resolution to listen to
nothing else, and an honest indignation at the sus∣picion
of his being capable of partiality or corrup∣tion.
This is the conduct which integrity dictates,
and which is necessary for keeping a good con∣science.
This is the conduct which will redound
to the honour of the whole order; it is indeed
necessary for preserving it from reproach or con∣tempt.
And this conduct will most effectually
secure a man's own ease and independence; for if
it be once known that this is a man's fixed deter∣mination,
he will meet with no importunities; and
if he adhere to it uniformly and sacredly, no per∣son
will think that he has a title to be offended,
on whichever side he gives his judgement; he will
not only preserve more general esteem, but will run
less risk of incurring the displeasure of individuals,
than they who are more open to influence, who
therefore offend in every instance where they do
not hearken to it, and who are often reduced to
situations in which they must incur the displeasure
of some one of the contending parties.</P>
<P>The other great subject of judging, about which
a clergyman has occasion to be conversant, is the
<PB N="396" REF="403"/>
qualifications of candidates for the ministry. This
is evidently a duty of great importance. Nothing
can have a nearer connection with the prevalence
or the decline of religion and virtue, than the
abilities and manners of the clergy. The greatest
care is therefore incumbent on those on whom the
choice of them depends. A minister ought to take
all the pains he can, to learn the true character of
those who are proposed for this office; and if he be
not fully satisfied, either by his personal knowlege,
or by the information of those who have personal
knowlege, that they are, in respect both of understanding
and morals, really qualified for this office,
he should not be prevailed on, by friendship, or
attachment, or compassion, or any sort of influence,
to concur in bringing them into this important
office. It is an exhortation of the apostle Paul,
“Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be par∣taker
of other men's sins<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. v. 22.</NOTE>.” To do it suddenly,
is to do it without a strict and accurate inquiry into
a man's real character; and by doing it thus sud∣denly,
men in some measure incur a share in the
guilt of the unworthy person to whose promotion
they contribute. This is, in general, very little
attended to; but every clergyman ought to charge
his conscience, in a deep and particular manner,
not to contribute to bring any person into the
ministry, if he have any reason to think that his
<PB N="397" REF="404"/>
abilities are not such as may raise him above con∣tempt,
and render him really useful, or that his
life is not so regular, and his temper so virtuous,
as to make him fit to be put in holy orders. This
will be particularly incumbent on a clergyman in
presbyteries, where motions for licensing take their
first rise; for there one has the best opportunities
for information; and superior judicatories are often
obliged to take things for granted on the inform∣ation
of those lesser courts, to whom it is supposed
a person proposed is fully known. Both intel∣lectual
and moral qualifications ought to be re∣garded;
but the latter are of much greater conse∣quence
than the former. In some situations, a
moderate degree of the former will be sufficient;
but in any possible situation a sensible defect of the
latter cannot fail to produce the worst consequences,
with respect both to the usefulness of the minister,
and the general interests of religion. Were clergy∣men
as careful in this part of their duty as they
ought to be, it would in a great measure prevent
all the inconveniencies which could be appre∣hended
from any particular method of settling
parishes.</P>
<P>Ministers, as members of church courts, have
not only a power of judging, but likewise a fort of
legislative authority. All the fundamental laws of
religion are contained in the scriptures; those of
particular cstablishments or forms of religion are
fixed by the original constitution of particular
<PB N="398" REF="405"/>
churches: but there is a necessity for additional
laws on account of particular emergencies and
changes of circumstances. These ought always
to be consistent with scripture; they ought to pre∣scribe
the best means of answering the ends of re∣ligion,
in the present situation, and according to
the particular circumstances which take place. In
ecclesiastical, as well as in all other matters, the
true spirit of a legislator is the spirit of moderation,
disposing to avoid all extremes. Care should be
taken that laws which are made really tend to answer
the end for which they are made; for it is no un∣common
thing for legislators to understand so little
the nature of some laws, that by some of their
consequences they obstruct the very ends for which
they were designed, and which, considered in one
light, they appeared fit to promote. All ambiguity,
obscurity, and confusion, ought to be avoided in
making laws; for it will prove a source of endless
questions and cavil, and an occasion of arbitrary
sentences, when the laws come to be executed.
No useless laws should be made, for they always
weaken such as are necessary. A law should al∣ways
be framed so that it may not be easily eluded,
for when it can, it never fails to detract from the
authority by which it was enacted. Penal laws
in matters of religion and speculative opinions are
always pernicious; as the clergy cannot enact
them by their own authority, they should never
wish to see them enacted by the civil power. If
they be executed, they only destroy mankind; if
<PB N="399" REF="406"/>
they be not executed, they show the impotence of
those by whom they were enacted.</P>
<P>There seems to me to be more of a moral obli∣gation
on clergymen to attend judicatories of which
they are members, than is commonly apprehended.
Many things may be done by a few, reflecting dis∣honour
on the whole body, which the presence
and influence of others might have prevented. In
this case, it is not easy to see how one whose busi∣ness
it was to have been present, can excuse himself
to his own conscience, if he neglected attendance
without good reason.</P>
<P>I shall conclude the consideration of the duties
of the pastoral office, with a few observations con∣cerning
the behaviour of a clergyman to his bre∣thren
of the same profession. God has wisely
constituted human nature in such a way, that re∣lation
of any kind excites a peculiar degree of love
and benevolence. This constitution of nature
leads men to love those of their own profession,
and to be concerned for the interest of the society
to which they belong. It is acknowleged that the
profession of clergymen unites them by as close
ties, as any other profession does those who exer∣cise
it. By this means, it demands a great degree
of benevolence from clergymen to one another.
This benevolence should exert itself in urging cler∣gymen
to be peculiarly ready to do those good
offices to one another which they owe to men in
<PB N="400" REF="407"/>
general. They should be warmly interested in the
concerns, and solicitous for the prosperity of each
other. Notwithstanding the great degree of equa∣lity
which is established among ministers by the
constitution of our church, there must necessarily
arise some difference in the circumstances of cler∣gymen,
from their situation, their demands, and
their advantages or disadvantages; and from the
very nature of man, and the greater or less oppor∣tunities
of men, there will be differences with re∣gard
to prudence, learning, and abilities. That
benevolence which men of the same profession owe
to one another, obliges those clergymen who have,
in any respects, the advantage of their brethren,
to be so far from despising them because they are
not so happily situated, as, on the contrary, to do
all they can to assist and encourage them. Bene∣volence
to the clergy as belonging to our own pro∣fession
will very naturally exert itself in a love of
their company, which will produce not only the
several exercises of hospitality towards them, when
they fall in the way, but likewise a desire to con∣trive
being in their company, and maintaining a
friendly correspondence with them. Nothing can
be more improving than clergymen's being fre∣quently
together, especially if, either when they are
accidentally in company, or in meetings concerted
on purpose, they would promote the knowlege,
and give advice in the affairs of one another, and
contrive the properest means of promoting the in∣terests
of religion and virtue. “Hereby they
<PB N="401" REF="408"/>
would be cemented into one body; they might
understand what were amiss in each other's con∣duct,
and try to correct it by prudent advices. It
is a false pity in any of the clergy, to see their
brethren running into ill courses without giving
them warning; it is a real cruelty to the church,
and may prove a cruelty to the person himself;
for things may be more easily corrected at first,
before they have grown to be public, or are
hardened by habit and custom.” A due degree
of that benevolence which clergymen owe to one
another as members of the same body, especially
if it be joined with a sincere regard to the interests
of religion, the good cause in which all are en∣gaged
will effectually extinguish those little rival∣ships
about popularity or the like, which create
grudges, animosities, and divisions, and turn off
men's attention from what is essential in religion,
to things which are at most but appendages of it.
Benevolence will likewise produce moderation to∣wards
one another on account of difference of sen∣timents
and opinions, which cannot fail to arise
among fallible men. The clergy will naturally
have peculiar occasion to exercise this virtue to∣wards
one another, because their studies are, more
than those of other men, confined to matters <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
religion, and so will most readily give rise to a va∣riety
of opinions; and likewise, because they have
peculiar opportunities of knowing each other's
sentiments. “Now, it is by considering our
brethren in the several endearing views in which
<PB N="402" REF="409"/>
benevolence will represent them, that we shall
feel ourselves,” to use the words of an excellent
writer, “inspired with the principles of true
Christian moderation. When we observe others
differing from us in opinion about lesser points,
or even, as it appears to us, erring from the
truth in more important matters, it will imme∣diately
occur to us, that we are all in a state of
much darkness, and equally liable to mistakes
and errors. Real love, and affectionate sym∣pathy,
and just views of human nature, will lead
us to reflect on all that vast variety of circum∣stances
which may prevail on honest and worthy
minds to embrace opinions widely different from
those which we reckon true.” These are some
of the principal duties which clergymen owe to
one another, which are all natural exertions and
effects of the peculiar degree of benevolence which
their being of the same profession tends to pro∣duce.</P>
<P>All the duties which we have enumerated are
incumbent on every clergyman; and all these
together are certainly sufficient to occupy the
whole man, to engage all his attention, and to
employ all his time. Yet he cannot, with a good
conscience, neglect any of them: he must devote
himself to them: he must not satisfy himself with
performing them in any way, but must be always
solicitous to perform them in the best way, and
must persist in performing them with greater and
<PB N="403" REF="410"/>
greater care and prudence, till they really answer
their design in a thorough reformation of the
people. This display of the duties of the pastoral
office fully justifies the view of its importance
and difficulty with which we set out, and even
shews that the highest picture of its importance
and difficulty which can be drawn in general
terms, falls far short of the truth. Every single
duty almost belonging to this office requires the
exertion of all the powers of human nature; but
all its duties together seem to require more than
human abilities. A minister is engaged to pro∣mote
the most important of all ends, the im∣provement
and salvation of mankind; the failure
of which is necessarily attended with everlasting
consequences of dread and horror; and nothing
but unwearied assiduity in the discharge of nume∣rous
duties, which will occupy every part of
his time, and which it is not easy to discharge
aright, can prevent a clergyman's being account∣able
for these consequences. A just conception
of the duties of the pastoral office must produce
a vigorous sense of its moment and difficulty;
and this sense must excite all who aim at the
office to the greatest care in fitting themselves
for it, and possess them with the deepest solicitude
that they may not be unworthy. The first step
to their being fit is to know what are the qualifi∣cations
requisite, and by what preparation they
may be obtained. Some observations on this sub∣ject
will complete our view of the pastoral care.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Requisites for performing the Duties of the
Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>FOR every profession some qualifications are
requisite, suitable to its nature, and deducible
from its functions, which every one that makes
choice of it should labour to acquire. For ac∣quiring
these, some means adapted to them are
necessary, and should be carefully employed; and
with some plain thoughts on the qualifications ne∣cessary
for your profession, and the means of ac∣quiring
them, I shall conclude this subject.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Qualifications for the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>THE qualifications which are necessary for the
pastoral office may be easily deduced from
the consideration of the duties which belong to
that office; for they will include every thing that
is necessary for the proper performance of these
several duties. In deducing them we shall study
brevity, because they have been very fully illus∣trated
<PB N="405" REF="412"/>
and set in different striking lights by many
who have treated of the ministerial character.</P>
<P>The qualifications which are of importance to a
clergyman are partly natural, and partly acquired.
It is not unnecessary to take notice of the former,
because, though they are not in our power, yet the
want of them shows that a man was never designed
for this difficult profession, and should determine
him, or those at whose disposal he is, to make
choice of some other occupation, for which so
great talents are not requisite, and in which he
may succeed better.</P>
<P>A clear and sound understanding and good
sense are gifts of nature absolutely necessary for a
person who intends to be a clergyman. They are
necessary for acquiring the knowlege which his
profession demands. They are necessary for apply∣ing
this knowlege in the several ways of instruction,
as occasion requires. They are necessary for en∣abling
him to avoid those errors and imprudences
both in teaching and in living, which would ob∣struct
the end of his function and the success of
his labours.</P>
<P>A strong and firm memory is likewise a talent
of great advantage to a clergyman. Memory is
necessary for acquiring the knowlege which suits
his profession. If it be remarkably defective, the
greatest application to thought or reading will be
<PB N="406" REF="413"/>
insufficient to furnish him with the necessary stock
of knowlege.</P>
<P>A warm, lively, and strong imagination is highly
useful to a clergyman. It gives him a readiness in
applying what he knows, with propriety, to par∣ticular
occasions which occur. It gives a great
advantage for the composition of public discourses,
and enables him to set every sentiment in a striking
light. It adds an ornament to all the knowlege
which he possesses, and enables him to apply it to
use with the greatest lustre.</P>
<P>These are intellectual talents derived from Nature,
which the occupation of a clergyman demands.
When Nature has denied these, it points out that
a man was not designed for this profession, as much
as its denying a man the bodily strength which is
requisite for any severe employment shows that he
was not designed for that employment and that
he ought not to make choice of it.</P>
<P>There are other intellectual qualifications neces∣sary
for the ministerial office, which may be ac∣quired
by those who are not defective in the natural
talents already mentioned, and which all who make
choice of this profession ought to be careful to
acquire. Knowlege is absolutely necessary for a
teacher. If it be asked, what kind of knowlege?
we may answer, that no part of real knowlege is
useless or superfluous. It is proper, however, not
<PB N="407" REF="414"/>
to represent the necessary knowlege as too extensive,
lest the view of its extent should discourage the
diffident from attempting this profession; or lest
solicitude to acquire all parts of it should confound
our studies, and render us superficial in every part.
But all the knowlege which is strictly connected
with the subject of a minister's teaching is certainly
indispensably necessary; so that no person who
has not a competent measure of it can be qualified
for the ministerial office.</P>
<P>A competent knowlege of the original languages
in which the inspired writers deliver themselves,
and of the history, antiquities, and customs of the
ages and nations in which they lived, or to which
they allude, is necessary for enabling us to find out
the true sense of the scriptures, and to illustrate
them in a just and clear manner; and this is the
business of every clergyman.</P>
<P>An acquaintance with the rules of right reason∣ing
is necessary for enabling us to argue conclusively
and with strength, both in private and in public;
for qualifying us for detecting the sophisms, and
answering the cavils of the enemies of our holy
religion; and for defending either the whole or
particular parts of it against their attacks.</P>
<P>A clergyman must possess that knowlege of
human nature which may show him the best and
<PB N="408" REF="415"/>
most successful methods of addressing men, of
informing their minds, or influencing their hearts.</P>
<P>Without such a knowlege of human life and
of the world as may make him in some measure a
judge of the characters of men, he cannot advise
or reprove them in a proper way, nor execute
any of the duties of his office prudently, with a
due regard to place, time, persons, and other
circumstances.</P>
<P>The knowlege of natural religion and morality
is still more nearly connected with the pastoral
office. Natural religion is the foundation of
revealed; its principles and the duties of morality
are all adapted, illustrated, and improved in the
Christian system. Acquaintance with these will
furnish him with materials for all the functions of
his office.</P>
<P>The knowlege of the evidences of revealed
religion is necessary, both for establishing his own
faith on a rational foundation, and for enabling
him to guard others against the attacks of unbe∣lievers.</P>
<P>The scriptures are the proper study of a clergy∣man;
they are the fountains from which his instruc∣tions
are chiefly to be drawn; the knowlege of
them is requisite for the discharge of every part of
<PB N="409" REF="416"/>
his duty. He should understand not only the
meaning of them critically, so as to be able to
perceive it on consulting them; but he should have
such an acquaintance with them, as to be able to
recollect and apply many passages of them as
occasion requires.</P>
<P>A knowlege of the several doctrines and duties
contained in the scriptures, in their proper order
and dependence; a knowlege of the different opi∣nions
which have been entertained by different
sects of Christians; and a knowlege of the history of
the several revolutions of religion and the Christian
church, will be highly serviceable to a clergyman
on many different occasions.</P>
<P>A collection of just and striking sentiments on
religious and moral subjects, and of examples
from sacred and profane history, treasured in the
memory, and rendered familiar by frequent
thought and meditation, will enable a minister to
perform all the kinds of teaching incumbent on
him with readiness and ease.</P>
<P>A knowlege of the principles and rules of com∣position,
and good taste, formed by the study of
these, and by an intimate acquaintance with the
best writers of every kind, is necessary for enabling
a clergyman to acquit himself properly in his
public performances.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="417"/>
We may add, though it will perhaps appear
trivial, that a propriety, justness, and force of
pronunciation, will give great advantage to all that
a clergyman says, and ought by no means to be
neglected. The want of it often prevents the best
things from having their full effect upon the bulk
of mankind.</P>
<P>But the most important qualifications of a clergy∣man
are those of the heart, sincere and uniform
virtue and goodness. A good heart, with a mode∣rate
degree of understanding and knowlege, will
enable a man to do much greater service in the
church, than the highest abilities joined with a
vicious character. All virtues are necessary to a
clergyman; all vices are unallowable in him; but
not all precisely in the same way. Some virtues
are so indispensably necessary, that the least appear∣ance
of the want of them is scandalous, and ren∣ders
him absolutely useless and contemptible.
Other virtues may not perhaps be so readily or so
generally missed, but to possess them will greatly
adorn his character. Some may properly be con∣sidered
in both these lights.</P>
<P>Some things, which are scarcely regarded as
virtues, at least are not rigorously insisted on in
other men, are absolutely indispensable in a clergy∣man.
Of this kind is what is commonly termed
Decency. Levity in conversation or in behaviour,
<PB N="411" REF="418"/>
which would scarcely be at all censured in others,
will be sufficient to render a clergyman ridiculous
and despicable. Decency obliges him to seriousness
in these respects, to moderation in the use of diver∣sions
and amusements, to strict abstinence from
every appearance of evil. In every thing he should
keep himself, to the conviction of all, at a great
distance from what is unlawful. He must rather
abstain from things indifferent, than run a risk of
offending such weak persons as are truly honest,
and do not pretend scruples as a cloke for pride, or
a pretence for censuring.</P>
<P>Particular care is necessary in abstaining from all
those vices which are regarded not merely as
defects of good dispositions, but as indications of
dispositions positively bad. Acts of these vices are
determinate; every single act throws an infallible
and lasting stain upon the character of a clergy∣man.
Thus every plain act of covetoutness, every
undue attempt to gain or to save money, as it is
always mean and gives a contemptible idea of a
man, so it brings a great stain upon a clergyman.
Every attempt in him to carry on a lucrative em∣ployment,
or to involve himself in business, even
such as is lawful in itself, will be regarded as a
mark of avarice.</P>
<P>Any act of injustice, whether dictated by avarice
or by any other principle, will appear to all to be
detestable in a clergyman.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="419"/>
All lying, falsehood, or perfidy, are likewise
regarded as positive vices, rendering the character
of a clergyman either odious or despicable.</P>
<P>Every degree or kind of intemperance is emi∣nently
of the same nature. A single overt-act of
it is sufficient, in the opinion of the world, to
eclipse and overbalance many virtues. It must
therefore be guarded against with the greatest care.
A freedom from every habit, and even from the
suspicion of this vice, is a qualification absolutely
necessary in a clergyman.</P>
<P>Positive acts of impiety, or expressions of irre∣ligion,
of whatever kind they be, whether swear∣ing,
neglect of the several duties of outward
devotion, expressions of indifference about the
principles of natural or revealed religion, scoffing
or talking lightly of religious and important sub∣jects,
will always be perfectly shocking in a clergy∣man,
and will render his character perfectly detest∣able.</P>
<P>A freedom from all these vices is indispensably
necessary in a clergyman; and in order to keep
free from them, he must possess a considerable
degree of the virtues opposite to them: an affect∣ation
of them, or an hypocritical pretence to them,
will not look natural, but will betray itself by its
appearance of force to the more discerning; it
it will not always hold out; the mask will fall off
<PB N="413" REF="420"/>
in some unlucky moment; all will see that it was
only pretence from the beginning; the detestation
which is due to hypocrisy will be added to that
which the vices attempted to be concealed excite;
and both together will be thrown on the detested
criminal. There are some of the virtues opposite
to the vices which we have mentioned, that though
they be possessed in the highest degree by a clergy∣man,
will only be sufficient to preserve him from
blame, but will not be considered as giving any
considerable positive worth or beauty to his cha∣racter.
Such particularly are temperance and
justice. Temperance implies an absolute command
over all the sensual appetites, so as to be able to
restrain them at all times from leading us into what
is unlawful. A minister must cultivate this virtue
in the highest degree, else he will more or less
expose himself to contempt; but to cultivate it to
the highest pitch will not be considered as doing
any more than preserving him from contempt.
He must adhere to strict justice. All his dealings
with others must be strongly marked even with
justice improved into equity: but the highest
improvement of it will only keep him blameless.
There are some other of the virtues already hinted
at, which, though some degree of them be abso∣lutely
necessary for rendering the character inoffen∣sive,
yet when they are cultivated in an eminent
degree, bestow great dignity upon it, and are
highly ornamental to the profession. These, con∣sidered
in this view, we shall have occasion to men∣tion
<PB N="414" REF="421"/>
again, along with some others, which likewise
adorn the character of a minister, and qualify
him greatly for the several functions of his
office.</P>
<P>We shall begin with Piety. Piety in all its
branches, as founded in just sentiments of the
divine nature, including love, reverence, grati∣tude,
resignation, trust, imitation, and fear of
God, and leading to the fervent and constant
exercise of devotion, is a temper of the greatest
importance to a minister. It was remarked already,
that expressions or acts of impiety are perfectly
scandalous. Such a degree of piety as may pre∣serve
from these is absolutely necessary to hinder
his becoming odious: but such a low degree of it
is not sufficient to qualify him for his office. The
highest pitch of it is necessary to render him an
example of godliness, to give him that constant
regard to God which will be the only settled prin∣ciple
of diligence in the discharge of the several
functions of his office, to enable him in teaching
to give a striking view of the obligations of piety,
or to give amiable displays of the several acts of
devotion, or an inviting view of the pleasures of
religion. The highest pitch of piety is necessary
to animate us in leading the devotions of Christians,
and to prevent our whole application to them
from degenerating into a train of hypocrisy or
formality.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="422"/>
A great degree of benevolence to mankind is
another necessary ingredient in the character of a
clergyman. We might have mentioned properly
enough expressions of resentment, malice, envy,
and the like malevolent passions, among those vices
which disgrace the character of a clergyman. Such
a high degree of benevolence as may not only pre∣serve
a minister from these, but also produce a
warm concern for the good of others, a concern
especially for the salvation of their souls and their
eternal interests, as may lead him to forgive in∣juries,
and exert itself notwithstanding the im∣pulses
of resentment, is necessary for adorning the
character of a clergyman, for enabling him to
exert himself without grudge or weariness in the
several duties by which he may benefit his people,
to give him spirit and earnestness in his several
ministrations, to give him a constant motive to do
all the good he can.</P>
<P>Benevolence will contribute greatly to form an∣other
virtue of great importance in the character
of a clergyman, true Christian moderation. This
is a virtue which will have many occasions of
showing itself, and is necessary for many purposes
in the pastoral office. It is neccessary for his living
peaceably with others, in a world where all men
cannot be of the same opinion. It is necessary for
convincing those who are in error. It is necessary
for his treating controverted points, either in
public or in private, with decency; and for pre∣serving
<PB N="416" REF="423"/>
him from that rancour, fury, and intem∣perate
zeal, which, being indulged, has exposed
the clergy to the highest censure among their
more discerning adversaries. It is nearly con∣nected
with that meekness and gentleness which is
so often recommended in scripture, and sets off
the character of a minister to so great advantage.</P>
<P>Humility will be of great use for enabling a
minister to submit easily to all the little offices of
beneficence which may contribute to the advantage
of men, or to his own usefulness. A vain, self-conceited
person can have no true relish of divine
truths.</P>
<P>It was already observed that plain expressions
of avarice and worldly-mindedness expose a minister
to absolute contempt: but it is necessary that he
have a much greater degree of elevation above the
world, than to preserve him merely from contempt.
A settled view of the vanity of the enjoyments of
this earth, and a superiority to them, would banish
all the workings of avarice and ambition, party-spirit
and faction, and would add the greatest force
and life to all a man's sentiments and discourses
on spiritual things.</P>
<P>I shall mention one other qualification of great
moment. It is to be possessed with the true spirit
of his office. A sense of the importance of this
office, an ardent desire to combat and overcome
<PB N="417" REF="424"/>
the difficulties of it, a zeal for promoting its end,
a pleasure in being employed in its duties, are
ingredients in this spirit. And this spirit raised to
a high pitch is necessary for keeping a clergyman's
business from being a drudgery, and for enabling
him to perform it with true force and relish.</P>
<P>These several qualifications it is the business of a
minister to cultivate as long as he lives. It cannot
therefore be expected that he should be perfect in
them when he enters into this office. But every
man who has not in him the principles and begin∣nings
of all these qualifications, and a settled reso∣lution
and eager desire to improve and become
perfect in them, is unfit for this office, and inca∣pable
of discharging its duties properly.</P>
<P>These are only hints on the principal qualifica∣tions
for this office, and the way in which each is
conducive to it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="418" REF="425"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. II</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Preparation for the Pastoral Office.</HEAD>
<P>AS the qualifications necessary for the pastoral
office are easily deducible from the several
duties of that office, so the necessary preparation
may be deduced from the consideration of these
qualifications. Whatever study or exercise is pro∣per
for forming or improving any of these qualifi∣cations,
is very proper for preparing those who
design to enter into the pastoral office.</P>
<P>Good sense and understanding are improved by
employing reason and judgement often upon all
kinds of subjects both of science and life, and by
imbibing just and solid principles from reflection,
reading, and conversation.</P>
<P>Memory will be cultivated by frequently accus∣toming
ourselves to recollect what we know, and
by frequently committing things to memory and
repeating them.</P>
<P>There is no faculty of the mind, on improving
which so little care is commonly bestowed in edu∣cation,
as the imagination: yet it is certainly im∣proveable
to a very considerable degree. It is
<PB N="419" REF="426"/>
improved by reading works in which real genius
and invention are displayed. These not only sup∣ply
hints to a person's thoughts, but at the same
time give an impulse to his fancy, and prompt
him to pursue these hints. Works of poetry are
particularly proper for improving fancy, in what
regards figures, images, and ornament; but too
much study may hurt fancy, instead of improving
it. The exertion of memory is always easier than
that of invention. On this account, if a person's
memory be stored with many things said by others
on a subject, his thoughts will fall most naturally
into that track which they have followed; whereas,
if he had been ignorant of their sentiments, he
might have perhaps pursued a new and original
track. If one be acquainted with the images
which others have used, fancy will be apt, from
the repositories of memory, to suggest such as
have been used already; but if it had not been so
much cramped by memory, and more accustomed
to invention, it might have discovered new and
original ones. Composition on different sorts of
subjects is the proper method of improving inven∣tion.
It would not perhaps be improper likewise,
sometimes to set the mind a searching for all the
images or illustrations which can be applied to a
particular subject: this exercise might sharpen the
inventive faculty, and give it a habit of ranging
easily and freely.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="427"/>
With respect to the acquired intellectual qualifi∣cations
before mentioned, or the different sorts of
knowlege necessary for a clergyman, it is only
needful to observe, that each branch of knowlege
is to be acquired by studying it with care and
application. All then that is proper on this head
is either to give general directions concerning the
best method of study, or to show the order and
manner in which the several branches of knowlege
already mentioned may be acquired. The former
is so extensive a subject, that it would require too
much time to enter into it particularly; and it is a
subject to which it is presumed none of you are
absolutely strangers. The latter we shall now
touch upon.</P>
<P>It is supposed that every person who aims at the
pastoral office has been educated in the Greek and
Latin languages; and that, during the time of his
application to the sciences, he has improved in the
knowlege of both, and acquired an acquaintance
with, and taste in, classical learning. It is likewise
taken for granted, that he has studied the several
parts of philosophy, particularly the abstract sci∣ences,
which lay open the principles of human
nature, which teach the rules of reasoning, and
the truths of natural religion and morality. But,
in improving himself in these parts of knowlege,
by applying professedly and statedly to the study of
them, he may very properly spend the first year
<PB N="421" REF="428"/>
after he devotes himself to the study of divinity.
By close application for that space of time, he
may make considerable progress in all these, so as
to be able not only to retain, but to carry himself
forward in them afterwards, by making them a
bye-study or an amusement, while he is carrying
on others professedly and as his stated business.
The second year he may make himself master of
all that regards the truth and evidences of revealed
religion, and make some progress in the study of
the scriptures. It may justly be supposed, that
from the very beginning of his application to the
study of divinity, and even before, he has, by
frequently reading the scriptures as a Christian,
acquired considerable knowlege of the plain and
practical parts of them, and has a great deal of
these parts digested in his memory, and in readi∣ness
to be recollected, when occasion requires.
But what we assign to this period of his studies is
a more professed and critical application to them.
In studying the truth of revealed religion, he ought
first of all to attain a thorough knowlege, and to
form a comprehensive idea of the positive evidences
of religion, whether external or internal, and
afterwards to examine the particular objections
that are raised against them, and the answers to
these objections. In studying the scriptures, he
should read them in the original languages, begin∣ning
with the New Testament, taking the assistance
of the best commentators, and, at the same time,
carrying on the study of such things as tend to
<PB N="422" REF="429"/>
illustrate the scriptures; as the rules of genuine
criticism, and the histories of antiquities, customs,
sects, &amp;c. which are alluded to in them. If one
be a diligent student, the second year will be suffi∣cient
to give him the knowlege of the evidences of
revelation, and to carry him through the study of
the New Testament. The preparatory studies
already mentioned are usually attended with the
study of ancient and modern history; and if this
study be carried on as a relaxation through all the
period we have hitherto considered, the student
will have made considerable progress in it, and
may easily, as he certainly ought, carry it on ever
after in the same way. In the third and fourth
years one may make considerable progress in study∣ing
the Old Testament, and in acquiring the
knowlege of the history of the church, the system
of religion, and the several controversies that have
arisen in it. The system and the history of the
church ought always to be studied together; they
will throw mutual light on each other, and they
are in fact little else than different ways of consider∣ing
the same thing. A fifth year may be very
properly employed in such studies (not dropping
those entirely which have been already mentioned)
as have a more immediate connection with Preach∣ing,
and the several methods of instruction neces∣sary
in the pastoral office. A person may be
employed in storing his mind with a variety of
religious and moral sentiments, by the study of the
best writers both ancient and modern, on practical
<PB N="423" REF="430"/>
subjects. He may likewise apply to study carefully
the rules of composition, and the best models of
eloquence, particularly the orations of Cicero
and Demosthenes, and accustom himself, more
frequently than before, to composition and to just
pronunciation. We do not suppose these things
to be wholly delayed till now; on the contrary,
the studies already mentioned cannot be carried
on without a man's having dipped into them;
we only assign this as the proper time for applying
to them more professedly, and making them one's
leading study.</P>
<P>The time we have thus parcelled out will be
sufficient for a man's acquiring the elements of all
the parts of knowlege necessary to a clergyman:
and by studying them in this regular order, he
will preserve distinct all the knowlege he acquires,
and fix such a regular plan in his mind, that
whatever acquisitions he makes afterwards in any
of the parts, will fall naturally into their proper
places. But it is only the elements that he will
acquire. Every time that he reviews any of the
parts, he will discover something new, and make
farther progress. He may afterwards, through
the whole of his life, be employed in prosecuting
any of these branches to which his inclination or
opportunities determine him at a particular time.
And if he has acquired a true spirit of study in
youth, he will find enough in these several
<PB N="424" REF="431"/>
branches to make his whole life pass both agree∣ably
and with continual improvement.</P>
<P>I would recommend it to those who are just
beginning to study divinity, to set out on the plan
we have delineated; and if any of greater standing
have not hitherto observed it or some other regular
order of study, they will perhaps find their account
in beginning it immediately. They will be able
to complete it in a shorter time; and in pursuing
it, all the knowlege they have acquired by more
desultory studies, will easily fall into its proper
place, and be rendered more clear and strong.</P>
<P>But though a competent degree of knowlege in
these several subjects be necessary, before one's
entering into the ministry, and may be acquired in
the manner now pointed out, yet every person
ought to set himself to make farther progress and
improvement after that time. “What is a very
good beginning, is by no means a sufficient
stock to go on with; and even that will-lessen, if
no pains be taken to increase it. Persons of lower
abilities and attainments are in danger, without
this, of becoming useless and despised; and they
who set out with greater advantages are bound to
endeavour at doing, in proportion, greater
services to the church of God<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Secker's 1st Charge.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="432"/>
It is absolutely necessary, as a preparation for
carrying on these studies, indeed for acquiring any
real knowlege, and therefore a necessary prepara∣tion
for the pastoral office, to lay aside all preju∣dices,
and to cultivate a fair, unbiassed temper of
mind, disposing to the impartial examination of
every subject.</P>
<P>The several moral qualifications mentioned can
be acquired only by practising the virtues which
they imply. It is of importance for the divine to
begin from the earliest youth to practise them. As
soon as he resolves on his profession, he should
immediately begin with firm resolution to practise
that blamelessness of behaviour, and to cultivate
that true worth of heart, which are necessary in
his calling. The virtues which are essentially
requisite to keep the character of a clergyman
blameless and free from contempt, he should be
master of from the very first, so as to be never
chargeable with any acts of intemperance, injustice,
falsehood, impiety, nor even of levity in conver∣sation
or behaviour: and his whole conduct should
show, even in the earliest life, that he has the
seeds of the sublimer virtues which adorn the
ministerial character, and that he is cultivating
them with diligence and speed. This early prac∣tice
of universal virtue is necessary on many
accounts. Any defect of virtue which a man has
shown, any indecency in which he has allowed
himself, though long before, will be remembered
<PB N="426" REF="433"/>
to his disadvantage after he has entered into the
pastoral office, and will throw a reflection on his
character. It will expose his after-virtue to the
suspicion, or perhaps the accusation of hypocrisy,
which will greatly diminish his usefulness. Besides,
a considerable change of manners on one's entering
on this office, or a little before, is always ungrace∣ful,
and has the disagreeable appearance of force
and constraint. Farther, one's indulging himself
while young, in manners which he must break off
when he becomes a clergyman, fosters habits which
it will be difficult for him to overcome, and which
may perhaps make him a slave to vice or levity
through his whole life. Many things which are
regarded as indecencies in a minister, may be
esteemed mere trifles, and perhaps they are so in
their own nature. But trifles have often very im∣portant
consequences. A minister can execute his
functions only by the authority which the opinions
of men give him; and therefore must regard the
opinions of men, while he endeavours to rectify
them. As vice is wholly inconsistent with the
ministerial character, so it is of importance that
one who is preparing himself for this office have as
many restraints from it as possible; and it will be a
considerable restraint that he be known, wherever
he appears, as a person who has the sacred function
in his view. In a word, one who would prepare
himself for the pastoral office, should always act,
in every respect, in such a way that he may have
no occasion, when he enters into this office, to
<PB N="427" REF="434"/>
make the least alteration in his manners or beha∣viour.</P>
<P>All that has been said on the pastoral office has
no tendency to gratify idle curiosity, or to give
scope to a disputatious humour. It tends wholly
to practice; and the knowlege of it is of no use,
except it be reduced to practice. It will deserve to
be remembered by you, that it is very possible for
a person to have a sublime idea of morals, either in
general or as regarding a particular profession, and
yet be very defective in practice.</P>
