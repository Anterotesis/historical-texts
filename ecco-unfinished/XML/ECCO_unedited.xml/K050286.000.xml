<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EFORE I enter upon the
Subject of Preparation for
so terrible a Visitation, as
this of the Plague; 'tis
meet I should say something
of the Reasons we have to be Ap∣prehensive
of it in this Nation; if the
Reasons of our Fears are not good,
the Seasonableness of the whole Work
will be call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in Question; and it may
be, look'd on, as an officious Prophesy∣ing
of Evil Tidings. To talk of Prepa∣rations
for a Danger which we are not in
danger of; would be a needless Alarm∣ing
the People, and is a Thing often times
attended with ill Consequences to the
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
Publick, being injurious to Commerce,
to Credit, and to the Civil Peace.</P>
<P>Blessed be God, the Evil is yet at
a Distance, and the Danger may be said
to be remote; But as we (1.) find it
to be a terrible spreading Distemper,
furious and raging beyond what was
ever known in this Country, sweeping
away Old and Young, till it has desola∣ted
whole Towns, and even some popu∣lous
Cities. (2.) That it spreads apace
this way, having already advanc'd it
self above 100 Miles in these Eight
Months past; and that we have some rea∣son
to believe that it was come much
nearer than they allow'd us to know of,
on these Accounts, I think, it is
reasonable, at least to put our selves
in a Posture, not to be surpriz'd if
we should meet with the same here.</P>
<P>Besides, I am far from being singu∣lar
in my Apprehensions; the Govern∣ment
are evidently in the same Concern;
and therefore we have had several <HI>Pro∣clamations,
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
Orders</HI> of <HI>Council,</HI> and o∣ther
Directions for Ships performing
Quarantine, and for Goods to be Open∣ed
and Air'd which come from sus∣pected
Places; and one Act of Parlia∣ment
has been pass'd to Enforce those
Orders, upon the highest Penalties, nay,
even upon pain of Death: And so
cautious was the Parliament in this
Point, that they put the Nation to the
Expence of 25000 l. <HI>Sterling,</HI> to Burn
two <HI>Turkey</HI> Ships which were but sus∣pected
to have Goods on Board, which
might contain an Infection, and which
might bring the Plague among us,
which 25000 l. has been paid to the
Merchants and Owners of the Ships
and Cargo, in Satisfaction of the Da∣mages
done them.</P>
<P>Can any Man say that the Govern∣ment
have not had Occasion for these
Measures? Let such look to what has
been done in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they not
only Burn'd two Ships, but Hang'd
a Man for Attempting to save some
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
Goods out of the Wreck of one Ship
that was Cast away, and which should
otherwise have been Burnt, as coming
from Places Infected, or supposed to be
Infected with the Plague.</P>
<P>Now while we receive daily, such af∣flicting
and melancholly Accounts from
Abroad of the spreading of the Plague,
and of its Approaches this Way; and
find not only private Persons, but even
the Government itself, and Neighbouring
Governments also, justly alarm'd, Who
can be wholly unconcern'd about it? Cer∣tain
it is, that if it proceeds much
farther, nothing but the distinguishing
Goodness of God can be said to keep
it from reaching hither; the Intercourse,
of Commerce, and the many necessary
Occasions of passing and re-passing be∣tween
the two Kingdoms, being so
great and a full stop of that Intercourse,
being so many ways Impracticable, as
we see it is.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
If the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are in Expectation, and
under just Apprehensions of it, what
Appearance is there of our Preparations
for it? Never less, I think, was to
be seen in any Nation under Heaven;
whether we speak of Preparations to a∣void
and escape it, or of Preparations
to wait and expect it; whether we
speak of Preparations for the Soul or
for the Body: And this alone has
been the Occasion of writing this Book.</P>
<P>We have indeed some Physicians
who have given their Opinions in the
Matter of our managing our selves with
respect to Medicine, in Case of the
Plague breaking out among us; and into
this purpose they treat a little (<HI>tho' very
superficially</HI>) of the Nature of the Dis∣ease,
the best preventive Remedies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But even in this Part, however, as
I said, surperficial at best, yet they differ
with, contradict, and oppose one another,
and leave their Readers as uncertain
and dissatisfy'd, as far to seek, and at
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
a loss for their Conduct, as they were
before.</P>
<P>As to the other Part, and what we
should think of doing when we set such
an awful Providence in a clear <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight
before us, with respect to our religious
Preparations, and for our me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting and
submitting our selves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dis∣pensations
of Providence of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind
soever, which doubtless, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
every Christian; of this, indeed, I have
seen, I may say, nothing at all offer'd
in Publick; on the contrary, the whole
World is intent and busy on their or∣dinary
Occasions; Men pursue the usual
Course of the World, they push their
Interest, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Gain, or their Plea∣sures
and Gaity, with the same Gust,
or rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more than ever: Nay, the
cry of the Nation's Follies, grows lowder
and lowder every Day; and so far we
are from considering, that when God's
Judgments are abroad in the Earth,
<HI>the Inhabitants should learn Righte∣ousness;</HI>
that we are rather learning
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
to be more superlatively wicked than ever;
witness the Increase of Plays and Play-Houses,
one being now Building, tho' so
many already in use; witness the Publick
Trading and Stock-jobbing <HI>on the Sab∣bath-day;</HI>
Witness the raging Avarice
of the Times, by which the civil Inte∣rest
of the Nation, is ruin'd and de∣stroy'd.
Witness also our Feuds, Di∣visions
and Heats, as well in religi∣ous
Differences, as those that are Po∣litical,
which are all carry'd up to
dreadful Extremes.</P>
<P>Ʋpon these many Accounts, this Work
has been set on Foot, which though in
the Design of it, 'tis Calculated for the
present particular Occasion of the Ter∣rors
we are under about the Plague,
which I may very well call impending,
yet may be useful many ways, both to
us and to Posterity, though we should
be spar'd from that Portion of this
Bitter Cup which I verily believe is
reserv'd for us.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="10"/>
To make this Discourse Familiar and
Agreeable to every Reader, I have en∣deavour'd
to make it as Historical as
I could, and have therefore interming∣led
it with some Accounts of Fact,
where I could come at them, and some
by report, suited to and Calculated for
the Moral, endeavouring by all possible
and just Methods to encourage the great
Work of Preparation, which is the
main end of this Ʋndertaking.</P>
<P>The Cases I have stated here, are
suited with the utmost Care to the Cir∣cumstances
past, and more especially as
they are reasonably supposed to suit those
to come; and as I very particularly re∣member
the last Visitation of this Kind,
which afflicted this Nation in 1665,
and have had Occasion to Converse with
many other Persons who liv'd in this
City all the while: I have chosen some
of their Cases as Precedents for our pre∣sent
Instructions. I take leave so far to
Personate the particular People in their
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>
Histories, as is needful to the Case in
hand, without making use of their Names,
tho' in many Cases I cou'd have des∣cended
to the very Names and Particu∣lars
of the Persons themselves.</P>
<P>But 'tis the Example that is the
Thing aim'd at the Application to the
same Measures is argued, from the Rea∣son
and Nature of the Thing, as well
as from the Success, and I recommend the
Experiments said here to be made, no
farther than they appear rational and
just, with whatever Success they had
been practis'd. As to the religious Histo∣ry
here mention'd; till I see some just
Exception rais'd against the Pattern laid
before us in very Part of it, I cannot
suggest there will lie any against the man∣ner
of relating it, and for that reason
I make no Apology for that Part, but
proceed directly to the Work itself.</P>

<HEAD>DUE PREPARATIONS, &amp;C.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>ERHAPS my Method in the

speak of, may be something
Singular; but I hop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they

to the Last.</P>
<P>1. Preparations <HI>against the Plague;</HI> and
these I divide into (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) General, Publick
and National Preparations, namely, for
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
keeping it out of the Country of City, or
Town we live in, and preventing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ts
spreading and penetrating from one Place
to another: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Measures which are now
taking, being I must needs say, very De∣ficient;
and (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) Particular Preparations,
such as relate to Persons and Families for
Preserving us from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfection in our Houscs,
when it pleases God that it shall come into
the City, or Place wherein we live.</P>
<P><HI>General Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>parations,</HI> seem to be confin'd
to the Measures which the Government or
M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gistrates m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y take to prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the People
from infection. The main <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing the Govern∣ment
seem to have their Eyes upon in this
Nation, is to Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Prohib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Com∣mhrce

have receiv'd in Foreign Parts, and by
Consequence, are apt to emit those Efflu∣via
a again when they Arrive <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere and
come to be spread: These Poisenous or
Infectio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Effluvia or Particles, as some call
them, take hold or seize upon the People
who are handling them: I need not in∣numerate
the particular sorts of Goods
which are thus esteem'd susceptible o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in∣fection:
Abundance has been said on that
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
Subject by other Authors, and all our
Proclamations, Acts of Parliament, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which have been pass'd on this Subject,
have taken Notice of them.</P>
<P>It is true, that as I have hinted before,
our Government have seem'd sufficiently
Careful to settle such Limitations of Com∣merce,
Prohibitions and Quarantin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as
have been n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry to be observ'd by
Ships and Passengers, coming in to his
Majesty's Dominions, with respect to the
Places Suspected, as well as to such as are
known to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow Visited; and also, to Ex∣tend
those Limitations and Restrictions to
more Places and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts as they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave thought
fit, and as the Infection has been found
to adv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earer and nea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad the
Injunctions thus la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d on our People, been
punctually and duly Ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erv'd, possibly
we might with s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Ground have been
encourag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to hope for Deliverance, or at
least to have flatter'd our selves with a
possibility of Guarding our Principal
Places ainst it.</P>
<P>But I must not omit that we are not
a Nation qualify'd so well to resist the
Progress of such a Distemper, or the En∣trance
of it into our Country, as others
are; we have a Set of M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n among us, so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent upon their G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, by that we call
Clandestine Trade, that they would even
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
venture to Import the Plague it self, if
they were to get by it, and so give it
to all that liv'd near them, not valuing
the gross and horrid Injustice that they
do to other People; what a Man ventures
for himself in nothing, because it is his own
Act and Deed; but what he ventures for
others, is the worst of Violence upon
them, and perhaps in such a Case as this,
is the worst sort of Murther.</P>
<P>This Vice in our Commerce, is intro∣duc'd
by the Necessity this N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion has
been in, of Clogging Foreign Trade with
heavy Duties and Imposts; which gives
Encouragement to Smugglers and Run∣ners
of Goods, to venture at all Hazards
to bring such Goods in upon us private∣ly;
and these Men, I doubt I may say
without Injuring them, Value not what
the Goods are or whence they come, so
they can but bring them on Shore free of
the Duties and Imposts I speak of: We
have Examples of this before us, which
justifies the Charge, and I need say no
more to prove it.</P>
<P>The Preparations against the Plague
in this Case, must be the Work of the
Government. It is consess'd, that this is
a Difficulty even to the Government it
self, and it will be hard to say what they
can do more than is done Effectually to pre∣vent
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
this dreadful Trade, and without
some very great Severity, I believe it will
never be done; and yet till it is done,
we cannot pretend to take effectual
Measures in this Nation for preventing
the Plague coming among us.</P>
<P>The Physicians seem at present to fall
in with the <HI>French</HI> Methods, <HI>viz▪</HI> of pre∣venting
the spreading of Infection, by
surrounding the Towns where it shall
happen to be, with Troops of Soldiers;
Cutting of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all Communication with the
Countries, or Parts of the Country where
such Towns are that shall be Infected:
This Dr <HI>Mead</HI> has been pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to pro∣pose
also in his Treatise, call'd, <HI>A Short
Discourse.</HI></P>
<P>I must Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, I do not see that this can
be made practicable in <HI>England;</HI> and we see
already it h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not been Effectual in <HI>France,</HI>
notwithstanding greater Severities have
been us'd there, than I presume will ever
be allow'd to be us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d here: <HI>For Example,</HI>
The Plague began in <HI>Provence,</HI> in Part
of the Country the most easily s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>para∣ted
from the rest of the World or any
that can be singled out on their Side,
as will apper by the Situation of the
Country. The South Part of <HI>Provence,</HI>
or as some call it, the <HI>Lower Provence,</HI> is
surrounded by Water on three Sides, and
<PB N="6" REF="17"/>
by the unp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssible Mountains of <HI>Piedmont</HI>
and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce</HI> on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourch Side; <HI>That is
to say,</HI> it is Bounded by the Sea from
the said Mountains to the Mouth of the
Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t River <HI>Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sne,</HI> on the <HI>South: On
the West,</HI> it is Bounded by the said Ri∣ver
<HI>Rhosne,</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>Du∣rance,</HI>
on the Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> side of the District
of <HI>Avignon: And on the North,</HI> it is Bound∣ed
by the said River <HI>Durance,</HI> to the
Mouth of the River <HI>Verdon,</HI> and thence
by the River <HI>Verdon,</HI> to the Foot of the
said Mountains of <HI>Piedmont.</HI></P>
<P>On the South-side, 'tis allow'd there
needed no Guard, the Nature of the
Thing Arm'd all the World, from re∣ceiving
any Veste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coming from <HI>Pro∣vence,</HI>
or suffering the People out of them
to Land; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am not misinform<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
several People that did put to Sea, (as it
were desperate from thence) are still mis∣sing,
and it is believ'd have Perish'd at
Sea, having not been allow'd to set their
F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et on Shore in any part of the World.</P>
<P>On the Side of the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> the West
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anks of that River have been so well
Guarded, that nothing has been able to
pass; and tho' the Islands in the Mouth
of the <HI>Rhosne,</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve been infected, the dis∣tress'd
People of <HI>Arles,</HI> having almost by
Force gotten out among them at <HI>La Ca∣morgue,
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
Salons,</HI> and other Places; yet
the River being Great and the Naviga∣tion
of it wholly st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp'd, the Distemper
has been kept o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f on that Side.</P>
<P>On the <HI>East</HI> side also, the Mountains
and the Fronti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of <HI>Nice,</HI> have been
so well Guarded by the Troops of <HI>Pied∣mont,</HI>
and the Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of those Moun∣tains
are so few, so difficult, and so easy
to be clos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d up, that very few of the
People have attempted to Escape that way,
and those that have attempted it, have
been fir'd at and driven back, or if pres∣sing
forward have been Kill'd.</P>
<P>But on the <HI>North</HI> Side, the Case has
been quite different, for the <HI>Durance</HI> and
the <HI>Verdon</HI> are smaller R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vers, and in
many Places Fordable; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that in spight
of all the Guards plac'd in their Lines,
and the Vigilance of the Patroles on the
Bank of the River, Men have made their
Elcape in the Dark, and by private Ways,
and have gotten into the Mountains, and
from thence being acquainted with the
Country, have pass'd on from Place to
Place till they have found Retreats and
been receiv'd by their Friends, and Con∣ceal'd
as they desir'd; some indeed, have
been discover'd and have been driven
back, and others have been Kill'd; but
certain it is▪ that among the many of
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
these desperate People, which have thus
got away, some have been Touch'd with the
Contagion: Nay, some that perhaps have
thought themselves Sound and in Health,
and these have carry'd it with them to
the Places where they made their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etreat.</P>
<P>Thus a Galley Slave, who made his
Escape from <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and as it is said,
reach'd to his Brother's House at <HI>La Ca∣norgue</HI>
in the <HI>Gevaudan,</HI> carry'd the
Plague with him; and thus it broke out
at once 140 Miles off of <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and
all the Precautions, Guards, Lines, Pa∣troles,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> used to prevent its coming
out of the <HI>Nether Provinces,</HI> were at once
De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated.</P>
<P>By the same Accident, it has spread it
self in the <HI>Gevaudan</HI> from one Village to
another, and from one Town to another,
till as by the last Account we are told, a∣bove
an Hundred Villages and Towns
are Visited in that Part of the Country,
and the Infection is spread into the <HI>Viva∣rez</HI>
on one Side, the Diocess of <HI>Ʋzes</HI> on
another, the Province of <HI>Auv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgne</HI> on a
third, and into <HI>Rovergve</HI> on a fourth Side,
and yet at all these Places, the Towns In∣fected
are immediately Invested, and all
Communication with them cut off as
soon as it is known they are Infected;
and all the other Regulations observ'd,
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
which are directed by the Government
there.</P>
<P>This now is the Effect of surrounding
of Towns with Lines and with Soldiers,
and Imprisoning the People against their
Will, forbidding the Sound separating
themselves from the Sick, which they
must needs take for an unsufferable Cruel∣ty,
and by which means they make the
People Desperate and Mad: So that ra∣ther
than stay in the Place to be poison∣ed
with the Breath of dying People, and
be certainly Infected with the stench of
Bodies Dead or Sick of the Plague, they
venture at all Hazards to make their
Escape, and in Effecting this, Infect their
Friends; and thus it will be among us I
doubt not, if ever such Methods are put
in practice here.</P>
<P>Besides, as they can have no pretence
to Invest a Town, or Prohibit the Inha∣bitants
from quitting it till it is Infected,
they put those Inhabitants upon all possi∣ble
means of Concealing the Infection
when it is begun, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll those who are in
the Secret of it can make their Escape;
and thus they Travel securely with the
Distemper upon them, and emi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ef∣fluvia
of Infection wherever they come:
Thus the City of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ignon</HI> was Infected a
Month and Seven days, <HI>viz.</HI> from the
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
17th of <HI>August</HI> to the 23d of <HI>September</HI> be∣fore
it was publickly known in the Coun∣try
round; so that People went freely in∣to
the City from all the Villages about
<HI>Avignon,</HI> and the Citizens went freely out
into the Country, and the Distemper was
fetch'd by one and carried by the oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r,
without any precaution to all the Neigh∣bouring
Towns for several Leagues round
the Place▪ several of which Towns are
more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atally touch'd with the Contagion
than the City itself, as <HI>Bedarid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> and <HI>Sorgues,</HI>
on the North, <HI>Barbantine</HI> on the South,
and even at length the City of <HI>Orange</HI>
it self; and now they are oblig'd to quit
the old Lines and post on the Bank of
the River <HI>Durance,</HI> and to draw a new
Line near 100 Miles in Length, <HI>to wit,</HI>
from St. <HI>Paul de Trois Chastean</HI> on the
<HI>Rhosne</HI> to <HI>Montbrun</HI> East, and from thence
down to <HI>Lauris</HI> on the <HI>Durance</HI> on the
South, and so on the Bank of that River
to its fall into the <HI>Rhosne</HI> West; and yet
all these Lines seem not to be capable to
effect the Thing propos'd by them, for
when the Inhabitants are thus made des∣perate
by Locking up the Sound with the
Sick, they do and will find ways to Es∣cape
whatever Hazard it may be to them∣selves
or others.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22"/>
Whereas if the People were left at their
Liberty, except as was practis'd here in
the time of the last Visitation, <HI>viz.</HI> by
shutting up Houses known to be Infected.
I say, if the People were left at Liberty,
those that did flee at all, would flee be∣fore
they were Infected, and thereby save
their Lives, and likewise not carry the
Distemper with them when they went.</P>
<P>In the next place, the Cutting off the
Communication of one part of the Coun∣try
with another in <HI>England,</HI> would be
such a General Interruption of Trade,
that it would entirely ruin the Coun∣tries
and Towns so cut off, and the Peo∣ple
would be very Tumultuous and
uneasy upon that Head.</P>
<P>It seems to me a much more rational
Method, that as soon as any Town or
Village appears to be Visited, all the
Sound People of the Town be immedi∣ately
removed and oblig'd to go to some
certain particular Place, where Barracks
should be built for them, or Tents pitch'd
for them, and where they should be ob∣lig'd
to perform a Quarantain of Days,
and after that to be admitted to go
whether they pleas'd, except back to the
Town from whence they came, if they
thought fit to remain where they were
till the Town or Village infected was
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
entirely restor'd, and had been so for a
full Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rantain, then they might be ad∣mitted
again; and if any Families prov'd
to have the Distemper in their Encamp∣ment,
they should remove again, leaving
the Sick Families behind: And thus con∣tinually
moving the Sound from the
Sick, the Distemper would abate of
Course, and the Contagion be less strong
by how much fewer Persons were In∣fected
with it,</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain than that the
Contagion strengthens, and the infectious
Particles in the Air, if any such there are,
encrease in Quantity, as the greater Num∣ber
of Sick Bodies are kept together: The
Effluvia emitted from Bodies Infected, are
more Rank and more Contagious, and are
carry'd farther in the Air, the more Bodies
are Infected, and are therefore more apt to
be receiv'd from House to House; and were
it possible for all the People in the Po∣pulous
Cities and Towns in <HI>England,</HI> to
separate on such an Occasion as this; and
spread themselves over the whole King∣dom
in smaller Numbers, and at proper
Distances from one another, 'tis evident
even to Demonstration, that the Plague
would have but very little Power, and
the Effects of it be very little felt: For
we see evidently that the Plague is car∣ry'd
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
from one to another, by Infected
Persons conversing with one another, or
by Cloths, Goods, Houshold Stuff or
Merchandizes, (which have been In∣fected)
being carried from one Place to
another and not by any General Stagna∣tion
of Air, or Noxious Fumes infecting
the Air, or Poisonous Particles carry'd
by the Winds from one Country to ano∣ther,
or from one City to another, as some
have imagin'd.</P>
<P>The Effluvia of Infected Bodies may,
and must be indeed convey'd from one to
another by Air, so Words are convey'd
from the Mouth of the Speaker to the
Ear of the Hearer by the Interposition
and Vibration of the Air, and the like of
all Sounds; but those Effluvia cannot
extend themselves a great Way, but like
ill Smells as they spread they die in the
Air, or ascend and separate, lose them∣selves,
and are rarify'd in the Air, so as
to lose all their Noxious or Infectious
Quality.</P>
<P>As the Flavour of an <HI>Orange</HI> Garden,
which in calm Weather would be most
sensibly felt at a Distance all round the
Trees, will be lost immediately, in a
High Wind, and be only smelt that way
which the Wind Blows.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="25"/>
In the like Case, I would caution those
People who live in the out Parts of, or
adjacent Places to infected Towns, to
observe the Blowing of the Winds, and if
the Wind Blows from the City towards
them, let them for the Time keep their
Windows shut on that Side next the said
Town or City Infected, and especially
not stand Talking or drawing in the Air
into their Mouths that way; but if the
Wind blows the other way, and Blows
to the said infected City or Town, then
they may freely open their Windows and
Doors, and Breathe or Talk as they will; and
this, because the Stench of the Town may
be carried some small length on the Wings
of the Wind; But let no Man fill the
Heads of his Neighbours with the Whim∣sey
of doing this at any considerable Di∣stance,
such as four or five Miles or more;
the Na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure of the Thing making it im∣possible
that the poisonous Effluvia can
keep together so long, or fly so low as in
that part of the Air we Breathe in, at so
great a Distance from the Place.</P>
<P>If on the contrary, we pretend by Lines
and Troops to Invest, or Surround an
infected Place, or a Part of the Country
where such an infected Town may lie:
I affirm, that it is not to be expected that
this can be so effectually done, as to be
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
certain that none of the People shall get
out: And besides, the Cruelty of Locking
up so many Sound People with the Sick, I
say, it will never be effectually done.</P>
<P>First of all▪ for the standing Troops,
they are not sufficient in Number, and 'tis
suppos'd the Parliament will hardly con∣sent
to raise a new Army for such a Pur∣pose:
As for the Militia, how far they
may be depended upon for such a Ser∣vice,
I refer to judgment: The Militia
are Compos'd of the Inhabitants of the
Neighbouring Towns and Counties where
they serve; it will not be easy to pre∣vent
their conniving at the Escape of an
Innocent Neighbour, or to prevail upon
them to Kill a poor honest Countryman,
for endeavouring only to save his own
Life, or to prevent their taking Money
to wink and look another way, or to
take a wrong Aim if they Shoot; and
after all suppose them faithful, it will
not be so difficult for bold and resolute
Men, who being made desperate by the
Distress they are in, care not for the Risque,
and are as willing to die one way as ano∣ther:
I say, it will not be so difficult
for 20 or 30 Men to join together in the
Night; and with Arms in their Hands,
to break through the Militia Men; who
'tis known are no great Schollars at the
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
Trade of Souldering, when if they were
regular Troops, they would not venture
it upon any Terms.</P>
<P>I shall not enter here upon the Debate
of the Invasion of Liberty, and the Ruin
of Property, which must necessarily at∣tend
such a Practice as this, I mean in
Case of Investing Towns; the Equity of
the Case does by no means agree with
things done in Cases of other Extremities,
as the Blowing up of Houses in Case of
Fire, Drowning Lands in Case of an Ene∣my,
and the like; but this is really shed∣ding
Innocent Blood, which is a kind of
Evil not to be done that good may come,
no not of any kind.</P>
<P>More especially, I object against this, as it
is not likely to answer the Means pro∣pos'd:
For Example, should an Infected Per∣son
by any adventure whatever, Land at a
Town on our Coast, and which God of his
infinite Mercy avert, should he Infect the
Family where he is Lodg'd: Shall 20
or 30000 People, who perhaps Inhabit
that Town, be immediately surrounded,
and as it were ty'd to the infected Family,
till Five Parts in Six of them perish?
This was, as I am inform'd, the Case of
the City of <HI>Thoulon,</HI> only that the Num∣ber
dead there, was exceedingly more;
certainly if on the first Suprize, the
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
Inhabitants of that Place had been permit∣ted,
or indeed, order'd to retire to some
proper Place at a Distance from the City,
and separated as they might have been the
Lives of 40000 People in that Town, and
the Villages near it, had been saved.</P>
<P>It is true, that in the Time of the last
great Plague here, Houses Infected were
shut up; and it is true, that the shut∣ting
up a House is the same Thing in
its Proportion, for that the Sound ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there shut up with the Sick as it is in a
Town; but the Case with Submission is
not the same, for here the Sound have
time to go away, they may Conceal the
Infected Sick Person so long, till they that
are willing in the Family to remove are
removed, and then they are not driven
back again like Murtherers, or Shot
dead for going away.</P>
<P>Besides, in private Houses, there is
some difference in the Equity of it, how
they are all of a Family, and have some
Obligation upon them to take the Risqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
one with another; but it is not the same
in a whole Town, and I cannot but
think Men have a natural Right to
flee for the Preservation of their Lives,
especially while they are Sound and Un∣tainted
with the Infection; and 'tis a
piece of Cruelty inconsistent with Reason,
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
that because the Distemper has reach'd,
suppose a House or Family, at one end
of a Town, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> therefore the Families
at the other end of the Town who are
untouch'd, should be Imprison'd and be
bound to st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere they are till it comes
to them; and thus as it were Condemn
them to Death for that which is their
Disaster not their Crime, and kill those
People for the good of others, of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m
the others were in no Danger.</P>
<P>As for the Arguments drawn from
Necessity and the public Saic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, 'tis ful∣ly
answer'd in the Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sal above, of
removing the Sound People wholly from
the Place, and causing them to Encamp
either in Te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts or Barracks, as the Season
will permit, till the Infection is over.</P>
<P>And this I take to be a much better
way, (especially where the Towns are
not too <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge.) than removing the Sick
immediately into Barracks, because the
Sound can go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fely away from the Sick,
and injure no Body in the Remove, where∣as
the People to be concern'd in remov∣ing
the Sick, and the Houses they go out
of, nay, even the Air as they go along
or are carried along, may receive the In∣fection
from them, and it may be many
ways dangerous to remove them, as well
to others as to themselves: But there is
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
no Danger of any kind in the Sound go∣ing
away from the Sick, except the Dan∣ger
of any infected Person going with
them, which must be carfully Guarded
against; and they must remove their Camp
as often as we find that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appen.</P>
<P>It is true, this cannot be done in
<HI>London,</HI> or in other considerable Cities in
General; that is to say, not by all the
Inhabitants, and there will be always a
great Number of people, who care not
to remove▪ whatever Hazard they run:
Some if they should remove, know not
whether to go; others have not Subsis∣tence
to Support them if they remove,
and others even though they cou'd re∣move
and have Substance sufficient, yet
will not venture These we have nothing to
say to, neither is there room to say any
thing of them; what is said above re∣lates
only▪ to such as being desirous to
remove, are not permitted, no not al∣tho'
they are really Sound and free from
the Infection.</P>
<P>Yet there are effectual Measures for <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and other great Cities, <HI>For Example,
First,</HI> That upon the Approach of the
Infection, Proclamation should be made,
that all People that intend to remove
themselves and Families, should do it
within such a certain time.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> All reasonable Encouragement
should be given to the poorer sort of Peo∣ple,
who had any Friends or Relations to
receive them, to remove with their Fa∣milies;
even to the giving them reasona∣ble
Allowances for their Travelling; that
as many poor Families as possible may
quit the City and separate, which would
be their Safety, and Contribute much
to the Safety of the whole City also.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That all such Persons as have
no legal Settlement in the Parishes with∣in
the City and Liberties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be
forth with pass'd a way by Authority, and
sent home to the Parishes and Counties
from whence they came; no Beggars, Va∣gabonds,
or loose People to be suffer'd in
the Streets.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> All the Parish Pensioners, Alms
poor, and Poor chargeable upon the Pa∣rish,
as also all the Hospital poor, should
be immediately remov'd at the Expence
of the Parishes respectively, to such Places
as each Parish cou'd procure for them, at
least 20 Miles from <HI>London,</HI> and to be
maintained there at the Charge of the
publick Parishes to which they belong.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> All Occasion of bringing Peo∣ple
to <HI>London,</HI> by the necessity of Business,
should be as much as possible prevented;
to which purpose the Terms must be Ad∣journ'd,
<PB N="21" REF="32"/>
the Inns of Court shut up; no
Man should be Arrested for Debt, so as
to be put in Prison above a certain Time;
but that if he cou'd not give Bail▪ or some
Pledge for his Appearance, such Debt∣ors
should be remov'd to such publick
Places as the Officers of the City should
be oblig'd to prepare, at the Distance of
15 Miles at least.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> That all the Prisoners for Debt
should be immediately removed to the
same Places as above.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> That all Criminals, Felons
and Murtherers, should be forthwith
Tried, and such as are not Sentenc'd
to Die, should be immediately Trans∣ported
or let out, on Condition of going
40 Miles from the City, not to return
on pain of Death.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> That all the Children of <HI>Christ-Hospital,</HI>
call'd the <HI>Blew Coat-Boys</HI> and <HI>Girls,</HI>
be immediately removed by the Govern∣ours
of the said Hospital to <HI>Hertford</HI> and

<P><HI>Ninethly,</HI> That all <HI>Work-house</HI> Children,
Charity Children, and all the Children of

them, should be remov'd into the
Country, at least 30 Miles from the City,
and be maintained there by the Publick.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="33"/>
<HI>Tenthly,</HI> That all Masters of Familes,
who purpose to abide the Extremity, be
Exhorted to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end all their Children that
are under Fourteen Years of Age into the
Country; and if any of them are desti∣tute
of Places and Friends to send them
to, on paving a reasonable Sum to the
Common Treasure of the City, care
should be taken to provide Accomoda∣tions
for them in the Country at the
publick Expence where they should be
well provided <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for a Year.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventhly,</HI> That the Governours of the
<HI>Ble<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hospital</HI> should undertake on the
Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment to them of a reasonable Sum
of Money by the City, to provide Main∣tenance
for all such Children as the Ci∣ty
should recommend to them; and to
be kept in the Terms of the Hospital;
that is to say, as they now keep their
other Children, not exceeding the Num∣her
of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thousand.</P>
<P><HI>Tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Governours of the

so that in short, all the Children in the
City and Suburbs should be s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt away.</P>
<P>These Evacuations of People, would
greatly lessen the Numbers of the Poor
in <HI>London,</HI> and consequently take away
the Fuel which the Fire of the Pest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lence
generally Feeds upon.</P>

</LIST></Q>
<P>All these Measures being taken at the
Beginning of the Infection, or at the first
Approaches of it, we might reasonably
hope, Gods infinite Mercy concurring,
that the City would be in a Posture to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the Visitation, much better than e∣ver
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
it was before; for tho' there would
still be many Thousands of the Inhabi∣tants
left, yet they would live at large,
be unincumber'd with Poor, and with
Children, and with all the Stench and
Filth that attend those who want Con∣veniencies,
and who would in such a
Calamity only serve to Infect one ano∣ther,
and strengthen the Contagion in
general.</P>
<P>It might be reasonable to suppose,
that upon this dispersing of the poor
People, and sending away the Children
of all sorts, two Thirds of the Inhabi∣tants
of <HI>London</HI> would be Absent, includ∣ing
all the Families of the better Inhabi∣tants,
who would Voluntarily remove and
take Country Lodgings; of this latter
Part we might make some Guess, by what
was the Case in the last Plague in 1665
the removing of the Inhabitants was at
that time v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y great, if we may believe
the Report of those that were then liv∣ing;
I say it was then very great, for first
the whole Court remov'd to <HI>Oxford,</HI> there
was neither Parliament or Term held in
<HI>London;</HI> so that all the Nobility and Gen∣try,
and Lawyers, vanish'd as it were at
once, and there was scarce a living Crea∣ture
to be seen about the Court; <HI>White-Hall</HI>
was Uninhabited, the Park shut up,
<PB N="25" REF="36"/>
the Passages every where stop'd, nothing
was to be seen at the great Houses of the
Nobility in <HI>Westminster</HI> and parts adjacent,
but a Servant or two to look after the
House, or perhaps no Body within on∣ly
a Watchman or two at the Gate
Night and Day, to prevent Robbing the
House; and as the Plague began in St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish, the People at that End of
the Town fled first; so that the Streets
look'd desolate, the Grass grew at the
Doors and upon the Steps of the Houses,
and the Streets were in several Places
barricado'd at both Ends, the Inhabitants
being entirely removed and gone. In the
City, that is to say, within the Walls,
as I have been told above Seven Thou∣sand
Houses were quite empty and the
Doors lock'd up; and in most of the rest
the Families were thin, half or more of
them gone; and this was, without doubt,
the Reason why the Number that dy'd
in the City, was much smaller in propor∣tion
than in any other part, there dy∣ing
more by 4551 in the two Parishes
of <HI>Stepn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI> and <HI>White Chappel,</HI> than in the
whole 97 Parishes within the Walls.</P>
<P>This was doubtless owing to the few∣ness
of the Inhabitants within the Walls,
where the People being generally Weal∣thy,
provided for themselves and their Fa∣milies
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
by an early Flight into the Country;
whereas in the Out-parts, the People liv∣ing
thicker and closer together, and be∣ing
Poor and wanting Conveniencies, and
not able to flee for want of Friends or
Money, or both, died in heaps and
strengthen'd the Contagion by their
Numbers.</P>
<P>It is a Consideration well worth the
Concern of the Publick, how many ways
a useful and valuable Charity it would
be to have the Children of the poorer and
middling sort of People remov'd at such
a time as that, into Places of Health and
Air, and to have them taken care of for
one Year: I cannot think but well inclin∣ed
Christians, were it propos'd to them,
would Contribute largely to such a Pro∣posal,
and what Charity and Alms would
not effect, publick Stocks should supply:
I cannot doubt but a Parliament wou'd
consider such a Thing, and establish some
Fund payable by the City, either by a
Tax on Coals, a Toll on Cattle and Corn,
consum'd in the City, or some such Thing,
upon the Security of which, Money wou'd
be easily rais'd to answer the Expence.</P>
<P>By this means, the Lives of an Hundred
Thousand poor innocent Creatures, who,
as God was pleas'd to say of <HI>Nineveth,</HI> know
not their Right-hand from their Left,
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>
would be sav'd, and those Children be
preserv'd for the Good of Posterity; most
of whom would otherwise inevitably Pe∣rish,
some by Want, some by Neglect,
some by the loss of their Parents, and the
rest by the Distemper.</P>
<P>But by this means, not a Child would be
lest in the whole City of <HI>London,</HI> and in
all its vast extended Suburbs; whereas
the Distress of poor Families in the time
of the last Plague, by reason of the great
Numbers of Children that lay starving
upon their Hands, was inexpressible, and
the Numbers of them that Perish'd in the
Streets and in empty Houses, and in o∣ther
Places full of Misery, added exceed∣ingly
to the Height of the Bills of Mor∣tallity.</P>
<P>When
I say an Hundred Thousand, I
do not suggest that there are but an
Hundred Thousand Children of 14 Years
old and under, I believe there would be
found near three times the Number with∣in
the Extent of the Bills of Mortallity;
but I suppose, One Hundred Thousand of
these to be meerly the Children of Misery
and Distress, such as must be wholly
provided for by Charity, and that the
rest should be either dispos'd of by their
Parents, or by the City; <HI>that is,</HI> by the
Publick, the Parents paying a competent
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
Sum towards their Maintenance as their
Ability should appear.</P>
<P>Be it which way it will, I insist upon
it, that there should not a Child be le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
in the City under 14 Years of Age: I
could give many Reasons why such a Step
as this would be so necessary for the
Preserving the Health of the City, but
I think it will not be disputed.</P>
<P>Having thus clear'd the City of all the
Poor, and of all the Children, and of all
the whole Families of those who can and
will voluntarily flee, I think it will not
be needful to say, that all other living
Creatures should be sent away or destroy∣ed:
<HI>Such as</HI> Dogs, Cats, Monkeys, Parrots,
and any Creatures that eat Flesh all should
be destroy'd, whether it be Beast or Bird,
and especially all the Weasels, Rats and
Mice if possible, the first of these, as to
Dogs and Cats, was done in the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft Visi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation
<HI>Anno</HI> 1665, but not the latter.</P>
<P>Also it is my Opinion, that there should
not be a Swine, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eg or Sow, lest alive
among the Streets, or near them, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, nor
a Horse, not that the Horse himself ab∣stractedly
consider'd, cou'd be dangerous;
but as the St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bles they are kept in, their
Dung, and the St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le or Water that comes
from them, occasions an ill Scent: It should
be prevented by removing the Horses al∣so
of all sorts.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="40"/>
Much is said, and great Stress is laid
by our Physicians upon the Article of
Cleanliness, and removing every thing
that is Nasty and Filthy out of the Streets;
and in Consequence of this, we find the
Grand Juries of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Middlesex,</HI>
presenting the need there is to put the
Laws in Execution for Paving and Clean∣sing

<P>I might here put the Inhabitants of

in any p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of the City or Suburbs;

<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
the skilfull Physicians may be Credited)
was owing to those vile Places abovesaid.</P>
<P>Another Observation of this kind may
be made, which will have the like Ex∣perience
to support it; and this is, that
it may be observed, that those Places of
the City itself, as well as of the Out-parts
which lye on the Shore or the
Bank of the River, buried more People
in proportion to the Extent of their
Parishes than any other; which may very
well be placed to the Account of the
Gulleys and Common Shores, the Bog-Houses
and Kennels of the City, which
bring all the Wash and Filth of the
Streets into the River, under the very
Noses of the Inhabitants, and which,
though it may be true, that the Tides
do twice a Day come up and cover
the Mouths of the said Shores and Gul∣leys▪
and carry away the Filth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
yet when the Tide Ebbs away, it is to
be seen what quantities of Carrion and
Nastiness are lest above Ground, and
how Nauceious such Things are to the
Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Whether this was the Occasion or not,
that those Parishes butting on the <HI>Thames</HI>
Side, were more Sickly than the rest, I
leave to the Judgment of all indifferent
Persons; and especially to those who Af∣firm,
<PB N="34" REF="45"/>
that these unwholsome Smells and
unclean filthy Places are a Cause, and an
Increase of the Infection.</P>

The like might be said of other Places,
but the Proportions are not so well
known, so I dwell no longer upon that
Part: I have mentioned these Things, to
show how the Opinions of the Physici∣ans
concerning Nastiness and Nauceious
Smells, that they are Injurious and Dan∣gerous,
that they propagate Infection, and
are a means to encrease the Plague, is
just, and that Measures ought to be taken
to prevent these Things, by keeping the
Streets clean, well Pav'd and Swept, as
the Grand Juries have presented: Ad∣ding
withal, That the Tide Ditches in
<HI>Southwark,</HI> at the <HI>Falcon, Lambeth, Rotherh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th
Horslydown, &amp;c.</HI> should be cleans'd and
kept full of Water by proper Sluices, to
be emptied and let go every Spring-Tide,
or else fill'd up and not suffer'd
any more: Also that the Gulleys and
Common Shores, running into the <HI>Thames</HI>
on the City Side; such as one at St.
<HI>Catharines,</HI> one at <HI>Iron-Gate,</HI> one near the
Custom House, one at <HI>Billingsgate,</HI> another
at <HI>Dowgate,</HI> and several others, ought to
be sunk Deeper, Arch'd over, and car∣ry'd
down to low Water Mark.</P>
<P>But I leave this, as also the Managing
of <HI>Fleet Ditch,</HI> and the upper part of it,
especially between <HI>Holborn-Bridge</HI> and
<HI>Hockley</HI> in the <HI>Hole,</HI> a Nauceious and a∣bominable
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>
Sink of publick Nastiness. I
say, I leave these Things to the Conside∣ration
of the Magistrates, who, if they
have any Regard to the Health of the
Inhabitants, will certainly think that
part worth their while to take Notice
of.</P>
<P>I go on (2.) in my own Method to
such Precautions or Preparations, as are
Private and Personal; and which I ob∣serve,
are not much thought of by many
People, though I believe the most neces∣sary
of all the rest. It is true, that the
nauceious Places whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h I have mention'd,
are of dangerous Consequence in their
kind: But I must say, that People ought
to turn their Thoughts to Cleansing a
worse Jakes than that of the Tide-Ditches
in <HI>Southwark</HI> or <HI>Fleet-Ditch, &amp;c.</HI>
and that is, that the People, especially
such as are to stay here at all Adventures,
should Universally cleanse themselves,
cleanse their Bodies of all Scorbutick
Distempers, ill Habits, and especially bad
Digestures, gross Distempers, and the like:
It is the Doctor's Business to tell every
Man according to his particular Con∣sitution,
and according to the Tempe∣rature
of his Body and Blood what is
fit for him to do. I only here Argue
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>
the Necessity of the Thing in General,
and touch some general Methods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I know Doctor <HI>Mead,</HI> is not a great
Friend to Evacuations in General, and
he says, indeed, that he would not have
Men bring themselves too low, and make
too large Evacuations, for that it is best
to keep the Spirit in some Vigor, and
this is good Advice, where Men are in
a State of perfect Health as 'tis call'd, be∣cause
Nature ought to be Cherish'd and
kept in Heart, that she may be able to
encounter the great Enemy that threatens
to Invade her. But the Doctor, with
Submission to his skill, mistakes the Case:
At the time of the Infection I would not by
any means have People bring themselves
down or sink their Spirits by too large
Evacuations: But taking the Case early,
and by way of Preparation, that is to say,
six Months or more before the Infection
comes, then it is quite another Thing;
then there is time to recover the Spirits
and restore the Blood, before the time
of the Distress comes upom them. Then
is the time, to Cleanse the Jakes, as I call
it, I mean the Stomach, and to Purge
off the foul corrupted Humours, colec∣ted
by long Intemperance, luxurious Eat∣ing,
Gorging the Stomach with Sauces
and high Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Inflaming the Blood with
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>
innumerable Debauches of Wine and the
like: I say now is the time for Clean∣sing
the Stomach and Bowels, and for pre∣paring
the Body, by delivering Nature
from all the Burthens she was loaded
with before.</P>
<P>Besides, where an ill state of Health
is the Case, though it be not so long
before the time, the Thing differs ex∣tremely,
and the Man is under a diffe∣rent
Necessity: For he is concern'd to
deliver himself from the Enemy he has
already within him, least that Enemy
should Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ederate with the Enemy with∣out,
and so the Man should be plung'd
before he is aware.</P>
<P>That the State of our Body at the
time of the Infection, renders it more or
less susceptible of the Infection itself, no
Man of common Sense will Dispute.
There is a Sympathy of Parts between
the Body and the Distemper, while the
Body is clogg'd, the Blood corrupt, the
Stomach foul, doubtless to receive infected
poisonous Vapours into the Body at that
time, must put the whole Mass of Blood
into new Ferments: We receive Poison
one of another▪ and we emit Poison one
to another; and thus the Plague is pro∣pagated,
though we know not the Mo∣dus
in every particular Person, for I
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>
will not doubt that the Infection or Di∣stemper
is Contagious.</P>
<P>If we would be freed from receiving
Infection, we should certainly assure our
selves that we have no Infection already
lodg'd in us; and this must be try'd in
an effectual Manner: The Glands of the
Stomach should be cleans'd by frequent
Emeticks but gentle, the Venome of
antient Distempers, should be purg'd
out of the Blood, and therefore gentle
Salivations would be excellent Prepara∣tions
where they can be allow'd of; and
let no Man object the Scandal of that
Medicine, it is certainly administer'd in
modern Practice with great Success, in
Cases not at all Venereal, and consequent∣ly
not Scandalous: The Blood as well
as the Body must be Cleans'd, and no∣thing
can so effectually give, as it were,
a New and Infant Blood as this of Sa∣livation:
And I durst Mortgage all my
Skill in Physick, if any one Person, who
being in an ordinary State of Health, so
as not to be Sick of any capital Distemper,
having taken this a few Days, and in but
a moderate Degree. I say, if any one of
these should be affected by the Plague.</P>
<P>But pray take this with you as you go,
that the Evacuations or other Remedies
which I am now speaking of, are not sup∣pos'd
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
to be so much as thought of after
the Infection is come; Nay, not only not
after it is come into the Body, and has
touch'd the Spirits, but I say, not after
it is come into the Place, for then when
the Enemy is at the Door, all the Forces
of Nature are to be muster'd together; but
all the Reinforcements and Encourage∣ments
that are proper to strengthen Na∣ture
for her Defence, should be brought
to her Aid. No Garrison ought to have
their Fortifications to build, when the
Siege against them is laid; all the Parts
should be done and finished before, and
when the Siege is laid and the Enemy
are Battering their Works the Business then
is to Counter Batter him, Harrass him
with continual Sallies, and be Vigilant, rea∣dy
on all his Assaults to repel his Forces.</P>
<P>The Simily or Allusion, I hope, is not
improper, due Evacuations as above, and
after that temperate and wholesome
Dyet are the Fortifications of Nature,
and ought to be the Practice of Time as
long before Hand as possible. But when
the Enemy is come, then reasonable En∣couragement
ought to be given to the
Animal Spirits, which are the Garrison
that are to defend the Fortress of Life;
The Man must, <HI>as it is call<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> be kept
in Heart and well supported, that he
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>
may not be sunk with Apprehensions
before it comes, or be surpriz'd with the
Attack when it comes.</P>
<P>There is another sort of Encourage∣ment
to prevent these Fears and Sur∣prizes,
which I would advise every Chri∣stian
to prepare, and to furnish himself
with▪ and that is the Fortifications of the
Mind: But of that I shall speak by itself.</P>
<P>What I say now, is to explain my O∣pinion
about Purging and Cleansing the
Body by due Evacuations, Namely▪ That I
particularly limit this to the time we have
to prepare against the Plague; and that
these Purgings and Cleansings should be
done now immediately, that Nature being
delivered in time from all foulness of the
Stomach, or Burthens on the Constitution,
may be strengthen'd again, and restor'd
in time, by proper Assistance, for the Com∣bat
with her great Enemy.</P>
<P>All Sinks and Receptacles of Filthiness,
say the Doctors, must be Cleans'd for the
preserving our Healths, by sweetening
the Air we breathe in, but what a
Sink and Receptacle of Filth is the Body
of Man? How is he to be restor'd but
by Cleansing and Purging off the noxi∣ous
Slime and Corroded Juices which
are dispersed in all the Vessels of his Body,
even those Vessels which common Cathar∣ticks
will not reach.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="53"/>
It is upon this Account, that I pro∣pose

the Means wholly, and leave all to Na∣ture
and Providence.</P>
<P>I might enter here upon an easy Proof,
that our ordinary way of Living in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
requires these Evacuations more
than is the Case of the People of other
Nations, and that if the Infection should
come among us, <HI>which I pray God to pre∣vent,</HI>
it will find much more Fuel to
feed on, than it does in other Coun∣tries
where People live more Tempe∣rately,
and where they feed cleaner
than we do here.</P>
<P>We saw plainly the Difference in this
Matter, in the late great Plague in <HI>Sweeden</HI>
and <HI>Denmark,</HI> where the Malignity of the
Distemper was far less, than in <HI>England</HI>
in 1665, and even in the Plague in 1665,
we found our People in the <HI>South Parts,</HI>
where we live more plentifully and feed
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
more grosly, were much more violently
Infected, than in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or in the <HI>North</HI>
of <HI>England,</HI> even in proportion to the
Numbers.</P>
<P>Next therefore to Medicines for the
Carrying off the Fund of Distemper which
is to be found in us, and which we owe
to the irregular Diet and intemperance
of our People, I must recommend to all
People, to alter their manner of Life, to
Eat, <HI>but especially to Drink</HI> more moderate∣ly;
and in a Word, to LIVE TEMPE∣RAIELY
and Sparing; to Eat less Flesh,
less Sauce, and less of the half Digested
Juices and Gravy of their Meats, which
a most pernicious Custom has enur'd
them to, by which they are brought to
Eat their Meat half Roasted and half
Boil'd.</P>
<P>It is a most unaccountable Habit that
we are brought to by our vitiated Ap∣peties
in this Nation, Namely, to Eat
our Flesh Meat, of which also we feed
immoderately, almost Raw: Indeed some
People may be said to feed little diffe∣rent
from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who Eat their
Horse-flesh Raw, if we were but to be
seen by the People of any other Country
how we Eat, especially our Wild Fowl, the
Flesh scarce warm thro', and all the un∣digested
Impurities of the Entrails and
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>
Inside of them serving for our Sauce.
I say, when Strangers see us feeding thus,
they must be allow'd to take us, as they
do, to be, if not Canibals, yet a sort of
People that have a canine Appetite; and
it was the modestest Thing I cou'd ex∣pect
of them, when in Foreign Countries,
I have heard them describe our way of
Feeding in <HI>England,</HI> and tell us that we
<HI>Devour</HI> our Meat, but do not Eat it;
<HI>viz.</HI> Devour it as the Beasts of Prey do
their Meat with the Blood running be∣tween
our Teeth.</P>
<P>Let no Man flatter himself in his feed∣ing
in this gross Manner, the Body so
fed is prepared not against, but for a
Contagion; and we have much reason
to fear, that if we should now be visited,
such a Visitation will find us half pre∣par'd
for it to work upon, and conse∣quently
we shall receive the Distemper
with more Danger.</P>
<P>Some People tell us of the Plague
being propagated by Insects, and these
carried from Place to Place in the Air,
in an unaccountable manner; which
if it were true, one Place would be ap∣parently
Infected as well as any other
and at the same time, as Blites in our
Orchards, frequently run over the whole
Kingdom. I leave those Philosophers to
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>
be confuted by the Physicians, who have
much better and more rational Accounts
to give of the beginning propagating
and spreading the Infection: But that
foul Bodies and gross Feeding make us
more receptible of Infection than we should
otherwise be, this seems to be a Truth
that both Sides must grant.</P>
<P>Temperate Diet, and avoiding Ex∣cesses
in strong Drink, which so many
ways debauch not the Head only but
even the whole Constitution, should be
avoided as carefully before the Plague,
I say as carefully as we would avoid Con∣versing
with an infected Body in the
time of the Plague.</P>
<P>If I can give any Credit to the Assu∣rances
of those who lived in <HI>London,</HI> in
the Time of the last great Plague, few
of those People we call <HI>Drunken Sots,</HI> es∣cap'd
the Distemper; it is an odd way of
observing on such things, and therefore
I desire to explain my self: By the Word
<HI>Drunken Sots.</HI> I mean a sort of People,
who have by a Habit of Drinking to
Excess brought themselves to Sotism
that have debilitated themselves, their
Bodies as well as their Understandings,
and are come to dozing over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Drink;
who make their Drink their Food, Eat
little, and Sip to keep their Spirits up;
<PB N="47" REF="58"/>
I need not describe what I mean by a
Sot, but according to my Friend's Re∣lation,
these Men all went off; some that
Drank hard, but had strong Constitutions
and that were not Conquer'd by their
Drink, tho' they were often Drunk, out
liv'd it, and had not the Distemper, but
the other were generally carry'd off.</P>
<P>What I infer from this, is, that In∣temperance
in Drinking, as it is de∣structive
to the Constitution, so it is a
most dreadful Induction to the Plague;
when the Spirits are attack'd by the
Venom of the Infection, they being al∣ready
Exhausted, are in no Condition to
Defend the Body, and so the Man dies
of Course.</P>
<P>We make a great stir, as I have said about
avoiding ill Smells in a time of Infection,
and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bradley <HI>in his Book call'd,</HI> the Plague of <HI>Marseilles</HI> Consider'd.</NOTE> one tells us, weakly enough, that
the City of <HI>London,</HI> was so close Built
in the time of the Plague in 1665, that
the Air had not a free Course, sufficient
to Purify the Streets, also that the Streets
were not Pav'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which 'tis insinuat∣ed
added to the ill Smells which pro∣pagated
the Distemper, both which as
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
they are but trifling in themselves, so,
they are really false in Fact; for the
Streets of <HI>London</HI> were Pav'd then as
well as now, and the Streets that were
then, may be judg'd by the Breadth,
and Buildings of those Streets which re∣main
still, where the Fire did not come,
and which, though they are not quite
so open and wide as the New Buildings
are, yet are they far from being so close
as to affect the Health of the Clty: Be∣sides
the Weakness of his Inference is
Evident another way, (<HI>viz.</HI>) it is ap∣parent
that the greatest Rage of the
Infection at that time was in the Out-parts,
where the Buildings were the same as
they are now, as in the Parishes of
St. <HI>Giles in the Fields,</HI> St. <HI>Martins in the
Fields,</HI> St. <HI>Andrews Holbourn, &amp;c.</HI> on the
West Part of the Town; and in the Pa∣rishes
of <HI>Cripplegate, Bishopsgate, Aldgate,
White-Chappel, Stepney, &amp;c.</HI> on the East and
North, in all which Parts the Neighbour∣hood
of the Fields prevented all interrup∣tion
of Air; whereas in the Close built
City, as he calls it, they were Healthyer
than in any other Part.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> likewise opposes his private
Opinion against the common Experience
of the Town, in the late Plague 1665, and
against the Advice of all the Physicians
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>
that were then in practice, about keep∣ing
Fires in the Houses and Streets at
that time, which was used with very
good Success; and it was found by Ex∣perience,
that those People who kept Fires
Night and Day in their Houses, were much
freer than others from the Infection; the
Heat of the Fire rarifying the Air, and dissi∣pating,
if not consuming the infectious Va∣pours
or Particles, call them which we
will, with which the Air on such Occasi∣ons
is suppos'd to be fill'd.</P>
<P>It was on this account that the Ci∣tizens,
by order of the Lord <HI>Mayor,</HI> and
the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> by advice of the College
of Physicians, kept great Fires Night
and Day at the Corners of the Streets, at
the Gate of the <HI>Exchange,</HI> and in other
publick Places; by which they believ'd at
least the Passing and Re passing the princi∣pal
Streets of the City, where the greatest
Numbers of People came, was kept
wholesome, or at least more wholesome
than other Places</P>
<P>The great Quantity of Coals burnt in
Publick and in Private on that Occasion,
may Confute that foolish Astertion of the
Author above mention'd, first, <HI>viz.</HI> That
at that time Sea-Coal was hardly in Use:
I think I need say no more of that ridi∣culous
part, than to Quote a Para∣graph
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
out of his Book, every Branch of
which is contradicted by the Knowledge
and Experience of Thousands now living;
his Words are as follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>London,</HI> at the time of the Plague, 1665
was, perhaps, as much grounded with
People as I suppose <HI>Marseilles</HI> to have
been when the Plague begun; the
Streets of <HI>London</HI> were, in the time of
the Pestilence, very narrow, and, as I
am inform'd, unpaved for the most
part; the Houses by continued Jetts
one Story above another, made them
almost meet at the Garrets, so that the
Air within the Streets was pent up,
and had not a due Freedom of Passage,
to purify it self as it ought; the Food
of the People was then much less invi∣gorating
than in these Days, Foreign
Drugs were but little in Use, and e∣ven
<HI>Canary</HI> Wine was the highest Cordi∣al
the People would venture upon; for
Brandy, some Spices, and hot spirituous
Liquors were then not in Fashion;
and at that time Sea Coal was hardly
in Use, but their firing was of Wood;
and, for the most part, Chestnut, which
was then the chief Furniture of the
Woods about <HI>London,</HI> and in such Quan∣tity,
that the greatest Efforts were made
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
by the Proprietors, to prevent the Im∣portation
of <HI>Newcastle</HI> Coal, which they
represented as an unwholesome Firing,
but I suppose, principally, because it
would hinder the Sale of their Wood;
for the generality of Men were (
imagine) as they are now, more for
their own Interest than for the Com∣mon
Good.”</P>
<P>“The Year 1665 was the last that we
can say the Plague raged in <HI>London,</HI>
which might happen from the Destructi∣on
of the City by Fire, the following Year
1666, and besides the Destroying the
Eggs, or Seeds, of those poisonous
Animals, that were then in the stag∣nating
Air, might likewise purify that
Air in such a Manner, as to make it
unfit for the Nourishment of others of
the same Kind, which were swimming
or driving in the Circumambient Air:
And again, the Care that was taken to
enlarge the Streets at their Rebuild∣ing,
and the keeping them clean after
they were rebuilt might greatly con∣tribute
to preserve the Town from Pe∣stilence
ever since.”</P>
<P>Nothing can be more contrary to Ex∣perience
and the Truth of Fact, than this
whole Story together or apart, (1.) to say
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
<HI>London</HI> was supply'd with Wood for Fuel,
in the Year 1665, and that Coal was
hardly in use: Whereas in a very little
while after, we found the Parliament
thought 1<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d. per</HI> Chaldron upon Coals,
a sufficient Tax for the rebuilding St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s Cathedral, and all the Churches that
were lost by the Fire; and I appeal to
the Coal Meeters Books, which were
then set up, for the quantity of Coals then
consum'd in <HI>London</HI> and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>Then that the Woods about <HI>London,</HI>
were chiefly of <HI>Chesnut:</HI> That they were so
about 300 Years before, I believe may be
true; but as the oldest Man alive can∣not
remember one Wood of <HI>Chesnut</HI> stand∣ing
near <HI>London</HI> or so much as a <HI>Chesnut</HI>
Tree left among all the Woods near
<HI>London;</HI> 'tis strange this Gentleman should
take upon him to write that, which so
many People now alive can contradict.</P>
<P>Again, as to the Wines which People
then drank, this Gentleman is most ri∣diculously
mistaken; for when he gives
the Want of the use of Brandy, and hot
spirituous Liquors for a Proof that the
Plague encreased upon them, their Diet
not being so invigorating as now; on the
contrary, I insist that the Food of the People
was rather more invigorating than it is
now: For <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s this Gentleman chiefly men∣tions
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>
the Wines they drank. I oppose to it,
and appeal to the Knowledge of the whole
Town, that if they had not so great a
variety of Wines to drink, they had no
adulterated Wines to Poison and Debauch
their Blood as we have.</P>
<P>If <HI>Canary</HI> was their highest Cordial, I
must tell him, that they had then only the
best, most generous and most sanative
Wine in the World for their Cordial; and
well it were, if we their Self-wise Poste∣rity
had such Cordials as they had; that
is to say, that our <HI>Canary</HI> was only our Cor∣dials,
and that our other Wines were not
adulterated and poison'd as they are, and
especially considering that we do not drink
Wine now, by Drams, that is to say, by
small Quantities, and as Cordials, as they
did; but by Quarts and Gallons, that we
make our Physi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k our Food and drink
Diseases upon our selves which our An∣cestors
at the late Plague knew nothing
of.</P>
<P>In like manner 'tis a mistake to say,
that they had no Brandy or Cordials at
that time; the Custom-House-Books a∣bundantly
contradict it; and it is too re∣cent
in our Memory, for any Man of
Years to forget, that the People had their
<HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and other Distill'd Waters to
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
drink as Cordials, on all occasions that
required Cordials.</P>
<P>But it is true, that there was not
Two Thousand Brandy shops, and Twelve
Hundred Punch Houses in <HI>London,</HI> as they
say there are now; and that the Spirits
which are now Distill'd, (or rather half
drawn) from Malt and musty Grounds,
are rather adapted to Poison and Destroy
Mankind, than to be Cordials to their
Blood.</P>
<P>It is out of question that the People of
<HI>England,</HI> liv'd more regular, and if I may
judge of it, far'd better in those Days by
far than they do now: What they Eat
and Drank then, was much more invi∣gorating
than our way of living now is;
for this Gentleman, though a Member of
the <HI>Royal-Society,</HI> must not tell us that In∣temperance
is an invigorating way of li∣ving;
drinking Wine as we drink Wine,
corrupted, adulterated and poison'd; drink∣ing
Punch by Gallons, made of Malt
Spirits, stinking, <HI>as I may justly call it,</HI>
of the humid, and half drawn from the
half Brew'd Worts: Cou'd any Man of
common Sense instance the Temperate
living of those Days, as a reason why the
Plague spread with more Violence, and
then bring up the Drunken sordid swal∣lowing
down foul Liquors, and gorging
<PB N="55" REF="66"/>
ourselves with Poison and Stench, as a
reason why we should bear it off better
than they?</P>
<P>On the contrary I must insist, that
our Vices which are already a Plague
upon our Morals, are a dreadful kind of
Fuel for a Contagion, and miserably
prepare us for a Plague upon our Bodies:
As to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vock they make of Consci∣ence
and Religion, and the Ruin they are
to Souls, I refer that to its Place.</P>
<P>Our Fore-fathers had Sins enough no
doubt, and for which Heaven brought
Judgments upon them most righteously;
but our Fore-fathers never were guilty
of the Luxury that we practise, neither in
kind or in degree.</P>
<P>But besides this, the Author <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speak∣ing
of, should have gone a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
back too, for the Deficiency in good Li∣quors
which he mentions, than the Year
Sixty Five; for the Flux of Wine from
<HI>France,</HI> which began to supply us, and the
Breach made on Peoples Morals by Ex∣cesses,
were really begun sometime before;
Namely, at the Restoration of <HI>Civil Peace,</HI>
and the People were arriv'd to some degrees
of Proficiency in Debanchery by that time,
though not to the violent Height which
they are come to since.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="67"/>
I bring it home to our present Case
thus; if the Plague made such Progress
in those days, when People liv'd in a
so much more temperate manner than
they do now, how much more reason
have we to apprehend its Progress now,
when the Bodies of Men are debauch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
with Excesses, in Meats and Drinks, and
all kinds of Intemperance? From the
whole, it is highly to the Purpose to press
our People to use proper Remedies, to
cleanse their Bodies of all the Gross Exha∣lations
and Nanceous Humours, which
fly up to the Brain from a foul Stomach
and from corrupted Juices in the Body; and
to shew how much reason there is to change
our way of Living, and begin a tempe∣rate
Course of Diet, that Nature after
having had the Assistance of Medicine,
may be invigorated and supported for the
Combat she is to enter into.</P>
<P>I perswade my self, that what I have
said here is so just and is supported by
such Reasons as it will not be disputed: I
cannot but think, that if these Things
were effectually consider'd and put in
Practice, the People of this City, wou'd
fare much better for it in a time of
Infection; and I am sure they would have
particular Satisfaction in the Experiment.</P>

<PB N="57" REF="68"/>
<HEAD>Family Preparations against the
PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> include these Preparations, under
the Head of Private, as oppos'd
to the Publick Preparations, I
spoke of in the first General;
but they are a kind of Publick, as they
are different from the Preparations last
mention'd, which are Personal and Par∣ticular.</P>
<P>I
must for the sake of this Head sup∣pose,
that the Plague (God forbid it)
was at the Door, or perhaps really be∣gun
in the Nation: Next to the Phy∣sicking
the Body, as I have said, and en∣tring
into a regular and temperate Life,
it comes to be consider'd, How Fami∣lies
are to manage themselves, and in what
manner of Posture People should propose
to put themselves, if possible, to prevent
the Contagion breaking in upon them.</P>
<P>The Pestilence, being as has been said,
a Contagious Distemper, it is one of the
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
first Principles <HI>in the Argument now in
Hand,</HI> that every Family should keep
themselves from Conversing with one
another, that is to say, from Conversing
with the Streets as much as possible.</P>
<P>When a House is Infected with the
Plague, <HI>we shut it up;</HI> this was done in
the late Plague 1665 with great Severity;
the Design is to keep the common People
from conversing with the infected Fami∣ly:
When a House is Sound and un in∣fected,
<HI>they should shut themselves up,</HI> to keep
them from conversing with the com∣mon
People, who perhaps may be in∣fected:
The first is done to keep the Fa∣mily
from giving the Plague to the com∣mon
People, the last should be done to
keep the common People from giving the
Plague to the Family; and the Reasons
are a just Alternative, Nature dictates
the one as well as the other; and let
the Inconveniences be what they will,
it is certain the thing is so necessary,
and the Success so visible and promising,
that no Family can repent the Design
of doing it; many have repented soreley
that they did not do it, or did not do it
in time.</P>
<P>Now 'tis no new thing to direct People
to keep as retir'd in their Houses as possi∣ble
in a time of Infection; but the Case
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
is, that People will not consine them∣selves,
or will not put themselves in a
condition to do it effectually; and I
must add, that not to do it effectually,
that is strictly, is not to do it at all:
Nay, not to do it strictly is worse than
no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to do it at all, as I shall show pre∣sently.</P>
<P>I
know a Family at this time living
in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> who having effectually lock'd
themselves up within their own House,
and never convers'd with the People of
the Town, never had the Distemper at
all; and yet <HI>Marseiles,</HI> if we may be∣lieve
the Accounts we have seen from
thence, was in a far more violent man∣ner
Infected, than ever the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
was.</P>
<P>If we may believe the Accounts from
<HI>Provence,</HI> their died in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and the
Villages within a League of it, above Sixty
Thousand People.</P>
<P>If we may believe the Bills of Morta∣lity
publish'd in the City of <HI>London,</HI> for
the Year 1665, there died of the Plague
in <HI>London,</HI> and the Villages about it,
that is to say, within the Lines of Com∣munication,
Sixty Eight Thousand Five
Hundred Ninety Six in that Year, and
no more.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="71"/>
Now all People that know the two
Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Marseilles,</HI> will ac∣knowledge
there is no Comparison in the
Dimensions, or in the Number of Inhabi∣tants
between the one and the other: If there
died 60000 People in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> it will be
granted that there died at least two Thirds
of the People; for they who reckon 90000
People to have been in that City, for
the usual Number of Inhabitants, are, in
my Opinion, sure to reckon enough:
Should the Plague then of 1665 have
swept away in <HI>London,</HI> a Proportion to
what it did in <HI>Marseilles,</HI> there must have
died even then above Four Hundred
Thousand People, which would have been
a Dreadful time indeed.</P>
<P>Again, the Case in <HI>London</HI> was really
moderate, compar'd to that of <HI>Mar∣seilles;</HI>
for though it is true, there were
but few People seen in the Streets in <HI>London</HI>
in the Height of the Infection; yet on
the other Hand, the dead Bodies did
not lie unburied in the Streets in Heaps;
the Sick were not laid out in Blankets
and on Couches in the Streets, to Ex∣pire
in the open Air; the poison'd Bed-Clothes
and Furniture in which the In∣fected
had liv'd, and on which the mise∣rable
Wretches had given up the Ghost,
was not to be seen in <HI>London,</HI> lying out
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
in the Streets and at the Doors, to be
trampled on as the People went along,
all which was the Case at <HI>Marseilles;</HI> so
that if the Particles of Infection were in
the Air, as some People suggest, it was
next to impossible to escape it there.</P>
<P>Now if the Family I speak of, did es∣cape
the Infection in such a Place as
<HI>Marseilles,</HI> and in such a time, and next
under God's Providence by the circum∣spection
they used, with regard to con∣versing
with others, much more might it
be so in the City of <HI>London,</HI> whatever
may happen; if the Distemper be not so
violent as to despise all Precaution, and
to Infect People that never come abroad.</P>
<P>It is true for a Family in <HI>London,</HI> to live
perfectly retir'd in time of a Visitation,
is scare practicable, nay, unless they are
sufficiently stor'd with Provisions of all
sorts for their subsistence, with Physick,
Clothes, and all other Necessaries, it is
not possible; and sor want of this, as well
at <HI>Marseilles</HI> as at <HI>London,</HI> many Thou∣sands
of Familes were Infected, who might
other wise have been preserved.</P>
<P>In order to direct any particular Fa∣mily,
who have Substance to enable
them to shut themselves up in so strict
a manner as would be absolutely neces∣sary
for preserving them effectually from
Contagion, to be receiv'd from any other
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
Person, or the Goods or Clothes of any
that are Infected, I shall here describe
a Family so shut up, with the Precau∣tions
they used, how they maintained
an absolute Retreat from the World,
and how far they provided for it; it be∣ing
partly Historical and partly for Di∣rection;
by which Pattern, if any Family
upon the like occasion, thinks sit to act,
they may, I doubt not, with the Concur∣rence
of Providence hope to be preserv'd.</P>
<P>THE FAMILY I speak of, liv'd in the Pa∣rish
of St. <HI>Albans Wood-street:</HI> They con∣sisted
of the Master of the Family and his
Wife, being either of them between Forty
and Fifty Years of Age, the Man about
Eight and Forty, the Wife about Two
and Forty and in pretty good State of
Health; there were Five Children, Three
Daughters and Two Sons, Two Maid
Servants and an Apprentice; the Person
was a considerable Dealer, and by Trade
a Whole<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le Grocer: He had another
Apprentice near out of his Time; a
Porter and a Boy, who he kept all em∣ploy'd
in his Business; but seeing the
Desolation that was coming upon the
City, he dimiss'd the Boy, gave him
sufficient to carry him to his Friends
in <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> and made him go away
<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
directly with the Carrier; his Eldest
Apprentice he gave the remainder of
his Time to, and he went away likwise
by Consent; as to the Porter, he did not
lodge in his House before, so there was
no occasion of dismissing him; but be∣ing
a poor Man and likely to fall into
Distress for want of his Employ, he ob∣lig'd
him to come evey day and sit at
the Door, from Nine in the Morning to
Six at Night as a Watchman, and to
receive any Orders, go of necessary Er∣rands,
carry Letters to and from the
Post-house, and the like, and had a
Wicket made in the Door, to take in or
give out any thing they thought fit; be∣sides
which, there was a Rope fasten'd to
a little Pully, to draw up any thing from
the Streets, or let any thing down; by
this Rope they often let down Victuals
and Cordials, and what else they thought
fit to this poor Man the Porter, and
especially his Wages constantly every
Week or oftner as he wanted it.</P>
<P>The Master having resolv'd thus to shut
himself up and all his Family; he first
took Measures for storing himself with
all manner of Provisions for his House;
so that if possible he might not be under
a Necessity to send for any thing out of
Doors; resolving to make it a standing
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
Rule, that the Door should not be opened
upon any Account whatever, that the
dearest Friend he had in the World should
not come in to him nor the greatest
Necessity in the World, Fire excepted,
oblige any one of his House to go out of
the Doors into the Streets; nor would he
suffer any of his Family so much as to
look out of a Window into the Street,
or open any Casement, except a Wooden
Window made for the Purpose, where
the Pully and Rope was, and that up
two pair of Stairs; and this Wooden
Window, he caus'd to be cover'd with
thin Plates of <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Tin,</HI> that nothing
Infected or Infectious should stick to it.</P>
<P>Whenever this Wooden Window was
open'd, he caus'd a Flash of Gun-powder
to be made in the Room, so as to fill
it with Smoke, which as soon as the
Window was open'd, would gush out with
some Force, so that it carry'd away what
Air was at the Window, not suffering
any to come in from abroad, till it was
purify'd and sufficiently Sing'd with the
Sulphur that goes with the Gun-powder
Smoke.</P>
<P>While this Smoke lasted, he that look'd
out of the Window talk'd with the Por∣ter
at the Gate, let down to him or drew
up from him what he had occasion for;
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>
but if the Smoke of the Gun-powder
abated, he immediately shut the Door
till he had made another Flash with
Powder within.</P>
<P>Before the time of shutting himself
and Family in, and as soon as he found
there would be a Necessity of it, he
carefully furnish'd himself with Stores of
all sorts of Provisions; but did it privately
and with as little noise as he cou'd; and his
Magazine was as follows, First as he
was Ten in Family, he allow'd them to
Eat a Pound of Bread each <HI>per</HI> Day;
but as he laid in a quantity of Meal be∣sides,
he abated one sixth Part, for Cake
Bread, and such other sorts as might be
made in the House; so he bought three
Thousand Pound Weight of Biscuit Bread,
such a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for Ships going to Sea,
and had it put up in Hogsheads as if
going to be shipp'd off; so that the Bis∣cuit-Baker
knew nothing but that it
was for a Ship that he was fitting out:
Then he caus'd it to be taken away in
a Boat, and bringing it up to <HI>Queen-Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,</HI>
landed it there and carry'd it by
Cart into his Warehouse, as if it had
been Hogsheads of Grocery.</P>
<P>In like manner he caus'd Twenty Bar∣rels
of Fine Flower, to be bought and
pack'd up, as they pack up fine Flower
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
for <HI>Barbadoes</HI> or <HI>Jamaica:</HI> I mention this
because it is known, that unless Flower

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> twelve Hogsheads of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Beer, which he had caused
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on purpose for keeping, be∣ing
so well Hopp'd that there was no
doubt o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its being Sound; and having a
good Vault for keeping them, they were
slow'd by themselves, and that these
might be suppos'd to supply him fully,
he had six half Hogsheads of other Beer
laid in for present use.</P>
<P>He took care for a reasonable quanti∣ty
of Wine, Cordial Waters and Brandy,
not for Mirth or plentiful Drinking, but
for necessary Supplies, the Physicians al∣so
having advised, every one that could
afford it, to drink moderately; so as not
to suffer their Spirits to sink or be dejected,
<PB N="67" REF="78"/>
as on such melancholly Occasions they
might be suppos'd to do.</P>
<P>To this end he bought a half Hog∣shead
of the best <HI>Cana y Wine</HI> that he
could get in the whole City.</P>
<P>Two small C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sks of <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sey,</HI> quantity
about 12 Gallons each.</P>

<P>Twelve Gallons of <HI>Anniseed Water.</HI></P>
<P>Two Runlets of Eight Gallons each of
<HI>Brandy,</HI> which was then very rare.</P>
<P>His Wife and Daughters had st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r'd
their Closets well with many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rts of
Distill'd Waters, as well Simple Waters
as others, and particularly a new C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dial,
prepar'd by a Prescription of the Phy∣sicians
at that time and call'd <HI>Plague-Water,</HI>
of this, though very Costly, they
had prepar'd the Quantity of Two dozen
Bottles.</P>
<P>Also his Wife and two Eldest Daugh∣ters,
had-stored their Closet with seve∣ral
Preparations of Medicines, as directed
by the Physicians, as <HI>Mithridate, Venice∣Treacle,
Diascordium,</HI> and <HI>Pill. Ruff. Lond.
Treacle, Diackylon, Turpentine,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="79"/>
Also they Collected all needful sorts
of Herbs and Roots, such as <HI>Rue, Mint,
Wormwood, Carduus, Angellica, Garlick,
Scabius, White-Lilly-Roots, Sage, Scrrel,</HI> and
other useful Simples, which they kept
dry, to use by the Prescriptions of Me∣dicine
publish'd by the College; so that
they might make up these Things if
need was, without the help of an <HI>Apo∣thecary</HI>
or <HI>Surgeon.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to Provisions,</P>
<P>The Master of the House, like a pru∣dent
Purveyor, took care to do every
thing without Clamour or Noise; so that
he might not be known to lay in a great
Store of Provisions; the Danger of such
Things being made publick being often
great, and no doubt would have been so,
had the City suffer'd any scarcity of Pro∣visions,
which however, by the Prudence
of the Magistrates was prevented; but
as that was more than he knew would
happen, he laid in all his Provisions with
the utmost privacy.</P>
<P>Having furnish'd himself with Bread,
with Flower, and with Beer; in the next
Place he went to a Butcher in <HI>Rotherhith,</HI>
none having yet died of the Plague on that
Side of the Water; and here he caus'd
three Fat Bullocks to be kill'd, and the
<PB N="69" REF="80"/>
Flesh Pickl'd and Barrel'd up, as if done
for a Ship going a long Voyage; like∣wise
six Barrels of Pork for the same pre∣tended
Occasions: These also he brought
by Water to <HI>Trigg-Stairs,</HI> where he Landed
them and Carted them to his Ware House
as before, as if it had been Grocery.</P>
<P>He then wrote to several Correspon∣dents
he had in the Country, and caus'd
Twenty Flitches of Bacon to be sent him,
some from one Place, some from another;
so that they did not come to him al∣together,
nor above two or three from
any particular Carrier.</P>
<P>He likewise had a large Stock of Cheeses,
particularly out of <HI>Wiltshire</HI> and <HI>Warwick∣shire</HI>
and <HI>Gloucestershire,</HI> about Six Hundred
Weight in the Whole; he Bought also
five very large old <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheeses; so
that he had a Store of Cheese for much
more than a Year.</P>
<P>Out of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> he had sent him Twelve
Firkins of the best Salt Butter that cou'd
he had; besides that, he had several Pots
of Butter sent him by particular Order
from other Countries where he had Deal∣ings.</P>
<P>He
took particular Care to lay in a∣bout
a Ton and a half of good White-Wine
Vinegar, as a thing that was par∣ticularly
useful on many Occasions, he
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
laid in a double or threefold Stock of
Coals and Wood for Firing, with Gun-powder
and Brimstone for Scents as a∣bove.</P>
<P>Also
Salt and Pickles in abundance, being
judg'd very wholesome, with some Hams,
Neats-Tongucs, and Hung Beef for Dainties,
with about 20 small Jarrs or Stone Bot∣tles
of good Oil, rather for Physical Uses,
than for Salads, for these they were sure
to be without.</P>
<P>Thus you have, as near as I can Col∣lect
his Bill of Stores, and the Magazine
was certainly well fill'd.</P>
<P>It is true, every Family cou'd not do
thus; but 'tis also true, that if all those
that could have done so, had done it,
and had done it in time, the Contagion
had not spread as it did into so many
substantial Families; for tho' it was said,
<HI>which however I do not grant,</HI> that none of
the Market-people were Infected, who
carried Provisions to supply the City;
yet this I can undertake to say, and cou'd
prove it by many People still living, that
abundance of People got the Distemper
by going to Market to Buy those Provi∣sions;
that is to say, by going out into
the Street to fetch such Necessaries as
they wanted, whether at Shops or in the
Markets; and therefore it was the most
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
necessary Precaution that cou'd be taken
by this or any other Person, to lay in
a Fund of Provisions for his whole Fa∣mily;
so as not to be oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to have
any Person go out of his House into the
Street, or into his House from the Street,
by which he was as much separated
from the People of the City, as if he had
liv'd several Miles off from them.</P>
<P>I should have mention'd, that he took
care to have all other needful petty Things
provided; such as Shoes, Hose, Gloves,
and all sorts of Linnen and wearing
Clothes; so that nothing cou'd be want∣ed
that they need go out for, of that
Kind.</P>
<P>As to Spice and Fruit, and all such
Things, they had sufficient in the House
by the means of their Trade as a Grocer;
and as to Perfumes of many Kinds, he
provided a great Quantity.</P>
<P>Candles, he laid in about 70 or 80
Dozen, that is to say, dozen Pound,
with a great many Bottles of <HI>Limon-Juice,</HI>
and <HI>Lime-Juice,</HI> those Acids being very ne∣cessary
on that Occasion. He doubly stor'd
the House, also with Vessels of all sorts;
such as Earthen-Ware, Glass-Ware,
and all such perishable Things.</P>
<P>He caus'd all the Rats and Mice in his
House, to be effectually Poison'd and
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
Destroy'd, and all the Cats and Dogs, to
be Kill'd and Buried deep in the Ground
in his Yard.</P>
<P>He built up three great Terras Ci∣sterns,
and had them kept constantly
fill'd with Water, that every Room in
his House might be frequently washed,
and not content with the Water of the
<HI>New-River</HI> in his Yard, which came in
by a Pipe, he caused a Well to be sunk
in his said Yard, and a Pump plac'd there,
that he might have Water to Dress their
Provisions with, which did not run open in
the City Air, or that cou'd be touch'd
with any dead Carcass, or have any li∣ving
Body or Clothes wash'd in it, which
were Infected with the Plague.</P>
<P>His last and greatest Concern was for
fresh Meat; and this he cou'd not con∣trive
any way for; and therefore except∣ing
that he made some Provisions of live
Fowls, which he caused to be kept for
the sake of having a few Eggs in the
House, and for now and then a Fowl to
Eat; he resolv'd to be content without
either Mutton, Lamb or Veal; and this
was the greatest Mortification they suf∣fer'd
as to Provisions.</P>
<P>With these Preparations, he began; he
forbore shutting himself quite in for se∣veral
Months after the Plague was be∣gun,
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
and even till there died above 1000
a Week; because that though the In∣fection
was very Terrible in the Out Pa∣rishes,
and especially in the <HI>West</HI> Part of
the Town, that is to say, in <HI>Holbourn,</HI>
St. <HI>Giles, Fleet-street,</HI> and the <HI>Strand;</HI> yet
the City was very Healthy, nor was the
Distemper felt within the Walls to any
Degree, till the latter end of <HI>June</HI> or the
beginning of <HI>July,</HI> for in the second Week
in <HI>July,</HI> when there died, as by the Week∣ly
Bills appeared, 1268 of all Distempers,
there yet died but 28 of the Plague, in
all the 97 Parishes within the Walls,
and but 16 in the whole Body of Build∣ings
on the <HI>Surrey</HI> Side of the Water.</P>
<P>However, the next Week after it was
doubled again; and as he foresaw the In∣fection
o'respreading the whole City and
all the Out-parts, like a dreadful Torrent,
as he had always said it would do, he be∣gan
to put his Resolutions more strictly in
Execution; for from the beginning of <HI>July,</HI>
he suffer'd none of his Family to stir
out without the Walls of the City, nor
in the City to any publick Place, Market,
Exchange, Church, or the like; and wrote
to all his Dealers and Correspondents in
the Country, not to write for any more
Goods, for that he could not send any
<PB N="74" REF="85"/>
thing out into the Streets to the Carriers,
or receive any thing in from them.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>July</HI> he begun to place his
Porter without the Door, where he built
him a little Hutch to sit in, and where he
(<HI>the Porter</HI>) receiv'd all Messages and Errands,
and deliver'd them as he got admittance
at a Wicket in the Door; and gave such
Answers again when call'd for, as he was
directed: By the 14th of <HI>July</HI> the Plague
was encreased in a dreadful Manner in the
Out-parts, so that the Bills amounted that
Week to 1762 of all Distempers, 1500
of which might be suppos'd to die of the
Plague, and the Number still encrea∣sing,
their own Parish being the second
that was Infected in the City. I say on
the 14th of <HI>July</HI> he shut the Wicket of
his Door up, and Bolted, Barr'd and
Lock'd himself in with all his House,
taking the Keys into his own keeping,
declaring to all his Family, that if any
one of them, though it were his eldest
Son or Daughter, should offer to stir out
without the Door, though it was but a
Yard off, they should not come in again
upon any Terms whatsoever.</P>
<P>At the same time he Nail'd up all the
Casements of his Windows, or fasten'd the
Wooden-shutters on the inside.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="86"/>
N. B. <HI>They had no Sash Windows in those
Days, nor for many Years after.</HI> This he
did because it had been the Opinion of
some Physicians, that there was at least
many unwholesome Steams and Infectious
Smells in the Air, especially in those
close Streets, and among the Houses where
the Plague was already spread; and it
was more than ordinarily observed by
curious People, that in the Houses which
were Infected, and had been shut up, and
where several Persons, or perhaps the
whole Family, had died, there was a
strange Clamy or Dewy Sweat on the in∣side
of the Glass of the Windows, like
the Sweat that will be on Windows in
a damp Morning; that this did not
melt off with the Heat of the Sun, as in
other Cases, but rather consisted the
stronger: That this was the poisonous Air
breathed out of the infected People's Bo∣dies
who had died of the Plague was not
doubted; but whether this was Infectious
in its Nature, and would if the Windows
had been opened have Infected the next
Houses, or the next People that had suck'd
it in with their Breath; this I say, was
not determin'd, neither do I determine
it, tho' to me it seems reasonable that it
should do so: However, this Prudent
Householder acting also by the Direction of
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
good Physicians, closed up all his Win∣dows
as above, except the Wooden Shut∣ter
kept open for Conversing with his
Porter without Doors, as above; he also
made Chimney-Boards, to close up all
those Chimneys in which he did not
keep constant Fires, as I shall observe
afterwards.</P>
<P>Till this time he had taken fresh Meat
of a Country Woman, a Higgler, who as∣suring
him she brought it from <HI>Waltham-Abbey</HI>-Market,
and open'd it not till she
came to his Door, he had some Satisfacti∣on
in it; but now he forbid her also,
and allow'd her coming no more.</P>
<P>Now therefore he opened his Magazine,
and distributed Bread by Weight to his
Family: It was long e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re his Children could
be brought to eat the coarse and hard
Sea-Biscuit-Bread, and he was fain to
distribute to them more Meal and fine
Flower than he purposed at first, and
they made themselves Cakes and small
Loaves of Bread as they cou'd; but in a
little time they were us'd to the other, and
they found ways to soak and soften them
by such mixtures as they cou'd get.</P>
<P>Being now entirely shut up, they scarce
knew how it far'd with their Neighbours;
except that they heard the Knells con∣tinually
Sounding; and their Porter gave
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
them in Weekly the Bills of Mortallity,
where they might see what dreadful Havock
the infection made in the Town round a∣bout
them.</P>
<P>After they had been shut up about
three Weeks, their Porter gave them an
Account that the next House to them
but two was Infected; that three Houses
on the other Side of the Way were shut
up, and that two Servants, out of ano∣ther
House on the same Side of the Way
but on the other Side of their House, were
sent away to the <HI>Pest-House</HI> beyond <HI>Old-Street.</HI></P>
<P>It
was observable, that it went hard∣est
with the poor Servants of such Fa∣milies,
because of their being often oblig'd
to go out on Errands, to fetch Things
which the Families wanted to which they
belong'd; as particularly, to the Markets
and to the Apothecaries and Chandlers-Shops,
which latter were at that time
the principal Market for all Necessaries,
except in Flesh meat, Fish, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It was a great Satisfaction to them,
that the People in the next House to
them on one Side, were all gone away
into the Country at the beginning of the
Visitation, and had left the House all
lock'd up, all the Windows barr'd on the
Inside, and Boarded up on the Out-side,
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
and had left the Charge of the House with
the Constable and Watch.</P>
<P>The next Houses to them on the other
Side were all Inhabited and all Visited,
and at length all shut up, and in one or
more of them the whole Families perish∣ed.</P>
<P>By
this time they heard a Bell go
ringing Nightly along the Streets,
but knew not what it meant, it not
being like the Sound of the ordinary
Bell man; and tho' they heard a Voice
with the Bell, yet as it did not go at first
by their Door, so th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cou'd not distin∣guish
what it was they said; and as their
Porter did not fit at their Door in the
Night as he did in the Day, they cou'd
not enquire; but at length their Porter
inform'd them that the Numbers of People
that died were so great in the Out-parts,
that it was impossible to Bury them in
Form, or to provide Coffins for them,
no Body daring to come into the In∣fected
Houses; and that therefore, the
<HI>Lord-Mayor</HI> and <HI>Aldermen,</HI> had order'd
Carts to go about with a Bell-man to
carry away the Dead Bodies; that this
had been done in the Parishes of <HI>Holbourn,</HI>
and St. <HI>Sepulchres, Cripple-gate,</HI> and other
large Parishes above a Fortnight; and
that they began now to come into the
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
City, and that in particular to the Parish
of St. <HI>Olave Silver-street,</HI> which was very
Sickly, and that the Carts were come thi∣ther
the Night before.</P>
<P>This was frightful enough, <HI>Silver-street</HI>
being also the next Parish to St. <HI>Albans,</HI>
only on the other side of the Way, and
the Distemper rag'd violently in both;
so that during that Fornight, which was
the middle of <HI>August,</HI> there died near
fourscore in those two small Parishes, and
still Encreasing; the Reason of this might
be partly the Joining of both these Parishes
to the <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Side of the Wall, and
the Parish of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> was at that time
dreadfully Visited, the Plague being come
down that way from St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the
Fields, where it began; and the Weight
of the Infection during the latter end of
<HI>August</HI> and the beginning of <HI>September,</HI>
lay chiefly on that Side the City; from
whence it went on to <HI>Bishopsgate</HI> and
<HI>Shoreditch,</HI> and <HI>White-Chappel,</HI> and so to
<HI>Stepney,</HI> taking the City with it, which
was as it were carried down with the
Stream; for the Infection came, as we may
say, first into the City at <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> and
so spread in a few Weeks quite over it.</P>
<P>At this time, <HI>viz.</HI> from the beginning
to the end of <HI>August,</HI> or the end of the
first Week in <HI>September,</HI> there died from
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
700 to 800, and almost 900 a Week in
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish only; and then it was
that the Carts were employ'd in that
Parish, it was indeed impossible to Bury so
many in the ordinary way, for there
died four Thousand People in five Weeks
time in that Parish; so that neither cou'd
Coffins be made or Graves dug for them,
or even Church-yards be found to lay
them in, so that they were fain to obtain
a Grant of a Piece of Land from the City
in <HI>Finsbury Fields</HI> adjoining to the Artillery
Ground, which was given them for a Bu∣rying
Ground, and remains so to this Day;
in which they dug vast Pits, and threw the
Bodies into them Nightly by Cart-loads,
always covering those with Earth in the
Morning, who were thrown in over Night,
and then next Night throwing in more
Bodies and more Earth, and so on till the
Pit was fill'd; so that as it was reported
by the Parish Officers, about 2200 Peo∣ple
were thrown into one of those Pits:
But this is a Digression.</P>
<P>All this while the Family continued
in Health, and the chearful Parent en∣courag'd
them to hope for Preservation
whatever might happen without Doors;
but when he had such bad News every
Day from without Doors, and that every
Night he heard the dismal Bell with the
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>
Cart, and the Voice following it in a
mournful Tone, <HI>Bring out your Dead;
Bring out your Dead.</HI> It cou'd not but
make heavy Impressions upon the Minds
of the Master and Mistress of the Fa∣mily,
and they began to look upon one
another with sad Hearts; believing they
were all but dead Corpses, and that the
Visitation was so appointed by Heaven,
as that it would sweep away the whole
Body of the Inhabitants, and that none
would be left alive.</P>
<P>In this distress he prudently order'd
all his Family to lodge on the lower
Floor, that is to say, up one pair of
Stairs, and that as many of them to lie
single as possible; and had all the Rooms
above furnished with Beds to lay any of
the Family in that should be taken Sick;
so that if any were taken Sick, they
were to be immediately remov'd into
some of those upper Rooms, as to an In∣firmary,
where they should be separa∣ted
entirely from the rest of the Family,
and a Nurse procur'd from abroad, to
tend them, and to be drawn up by the
Pully to the Wooden-Shutter, so as not to
come through the House at all, or Con∣verse
with any in the Family.</P>
<P>In ordering this, he appointed that
if he himself should be taken, he would
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
go immediately into the Infirmary, and
be attended by a Nurse as above; and
that none of his Children should be suf∣fer'd
to come up the Stairs or come near
him; and that if he should die, his Body
should be let down by the Pully also in∣to
the Cart, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so of the whole
House: Tho' his Wise assur'd him, that
if he was taken Ill she would go up into
the Infirmary and be shut up with
him.</P>
<P>We must suppose this Gentleman to
have much more Prudence than Religion,
and much more care of his Body than of
his Soul, and so of the rest of his Fami∣ly,
if he took no care all this while of his
House, as to their worshiping God; be plea∣sed
therefore to suppose, That as he was a
serious pious good Man, so he carefully
maintain'd the Worshipping of God in his
House, that three times every Day he
call'd his Family together in the solemnest
Manner to read to them, and pray to
God with them, always committing them
with the utmost Affection and Humility
to the Divine Protection, and casting
themselves into the Arms of God's In∣finite
Mercy. Twice every Week they
kept a solemn Day, giving themselves up
to God by Fasting and Prayer: Every
Night indeed, looking on themselves as
<PB N="83" REF="94"/>
dead Bodies, they laid down with dismal
Apprehensions; but were still Comforted
with finding themselves every Morning
preserv'd and in Health.</P>
<P>The careful Father was up every Morn∣ing
the first in the House, and went to
every Chamber Door, Servants as well as
Children, to ask them how they did;
and when they answer'd, Very well, left
them with that short return, <HI>Give God
Thanks.</HI> This he did, that if any had
been Ill, they might immediately have
been removed up Stairs, as is mention'd
above.</P>
<P>Hitherto he had corresponded with se∣veral
of his Acquaintances and Customers
in the Country, and had receiv'd Letters
from them, and written Letters to them
constantly; but would not do any Busi∣ness,
or send any Goods to them upon
any Account, tho' very much press'd to
it; because he resolv'd not to open his
Doors whatever Damages he suffer'd.</P>
<P>His Letters were brought by the Post-Man,
or Letter-Carrier to his Porter, where
he caus d the Porter to Smoke them with
Brimstone, and with Gun-powder, then
to open them, and then to sprinkle them
with Vinegar; then he had them drawn
up by the Pulley, then smoak'd again
with strong Perfumes, and taking them
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>
with a pair of Hair Gloves, the Hair
outermost, he read them with a large
reading Glass, which read at a great
Distance▪ and as soon as they were read
burn'd them in the Fire; and at last the
Distemper raging more and more, he
forbid his Friends writing to him at
all.</P>
<P>In the Height of this Calamity, and
when (as before) the good Man was almost
discouraged, he was still more straightn'd
by the loss of his poor faithful Porter;
he miss'd him at the usual Time when he
was wont to lower down by the Pulley
a Mess of Broth to him, or some other
thing warm for his Breakfast; but calling
to him he did not answer, which made
him afraid something was amiss with him:
However, he heard nothing of him all
that Day or the next; when the third
Day calling again from within the Door
for him, they were answer'd by a strange
Voice, who spoke in a melancholly Tone
that <HI>Abraham</HI> the Porter was dead? And
who then are you, say the Master to
the Person that spoke? I am his poor
distress'd Widow, Sir, says the Answerer,
come to tell you that your poor Servant is
gone? He was greatly afflicted at the loss
of so useful and so faithful a Person: How∣ever,
he compos'd himself, Alas poor Wo∣man,
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
says he to her, and what can'st thou
do then? O Sir, says she, I am provided for,
I have the Distemper upon me, I shall
not be long after him?</P>
<P>He was perfectly astonish'd and sur∣priz'd
at her last Words, and as he said,
it made his Heart cold within him:
However, as he stood surounded with the
Smoke of Gun-powder, and within the
Wooden-Shutter, he did not immediately
retire; but said to her again; if you are
in such a Condition good Woman why
did you come out? I came, says she Sir,
because I knew you would want poor <HI>A∣braham</HI>
to wait at your Door, and I would
let you know: Well, but says he, if he
is dead, I must want him, you cannot
help me that are in such a Condition as
you speak of? No, Sir, says she, I cannot
help you, but I have brought you an
Honest poor Man here that will serve you
as honestly as poor <HI>Abraham</HI> did; that
is kindly done, said the Master; But how
do I know what he is, and as he comes
with you that are Sick, as you say, how
do I know that he is not Infected; I shall
not dare to touch any thing that comes
from him? O Sir, says she, he is one of
the <HI>safe Men,</HI> for he has had the Distem∣per,
and is recovered, so he is out of
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
Danger, or else I would not have brought
him to you: He will be very Honest.</P>
<P>This was an encouragement to him,
and he was very glad of the new Man;
but would not believe the Story of his
being recovered till he brought the Con∣stable
of the Parish where he liv'd, and
another Person to Vouch for it; while
this was doing, the poor Woman after
some further Questions and some Money
thrown down to her for Relief, went away.</P>
<P>It was observable now, that whereas
they found, <HI>as is said above,</HI> that it was
very Melancholly at first to hear so many
Knells going continually, so on a sudden,
they now observ'd that there was not
one Knell to be heard; the Reason, as his
new Porter told him was, that the Num∣ber
of those that died was so great, that
they had forbid the Bells Ringing for any
Body, and People were all fetch d away
by the Carts, Rich as well as Poor.</P>
<P>Many Thousands of People would now
have fled away if they could, but no
Body would let them pass, and the enclos'd
Family began to be in great Terror; for
the Houses were desolated round about
them, the Numbers of People that died,
were scarce to be reckon'd up, the Bills
gave an Account of near 1500 a Week
within the Walls, notwithstanding the
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>
infinite Number of People that were gone
away into the Country, so that it was
his (the Master's) Opinion, that there
would not one Soul remain in the whole
City, but that all would perish.</P>
<P>However, he conceal'd his Fears as well
as he was able; and continued as well his
care over his Family, at his earnest Pray∣ers
to God every Day, and as I may say,
every Hour for them.</P>
<P>In the midst of this Misery, and as
he began to be very well pleased and
much assisted with his new Porter, and
particularly in that he was one, that hav∣ing
had the Distemper, he concluded there
was no Danger of his having it again; I
say, in the midst of this he was sur∣priz'd
with a near Affliction, for call∣ing
one Morning to his new Porter,
no Body answer d, he call'd several Times
again, and all that Day and the next he
heard nothing of him; but all the
Satisfaction he cou'd get, was from a
Watchman who stood at the Door of a
House that was shut up, for all such Houses
had <HI>Lord have Mercy,</HI> and <HI>a great Cross</HI>
set on the Door, and a Watchman plac'd
without, to prevent any coming out or
going in: The Watchman hearing the
Master of the House call the Porter by
his Name, answer'd, and told him the
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>
poor Man that used to stand at the Door
was Sick of the Plague, and he suppos'd
was Dead; the Master answer'd, I know
he was Sick that I had first, and is Dead;
but this was another: Well Sir, says the
Watchman, but he may be Sick and
Dead too, I suppose, as well as the first:
No, no, says the Master, you must mistake,
you mean the first; No, Sir, says the
Watchman, I knew your first Man <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
was dead, but this Man was call'd
<HI>Thomas Molins,</HI> was he not? Yes, says the
Master, then it is he I mean, Sir, says the
Watchman: Why that cannot be, says
the Master, he had been ill of the Plague
before and was recover'd, and he cannot
have it again? Alas! Sir, says the Watch∣man,
'tis that I suppose makes you so
hard to understand me; I know 'tis many
Peoples Opinion, that when any has had
it and recover they are secure; but I
assure you it is a mistake, for I have
been twice recover'd of it in the <HI>Pest∣House,</HI>
and been well a Fortnight between
the whiles, and now I am abroad again;
but I don't think my self safe at all by
that, for I know several that have had
it three or four Times, and some that
have recover'd three or four Times have
notwithstanding died of it afterwards:
and is my Porter <HI>Molins</HI> sick of it again,
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
says the Master, Yes, Sir, says the
Watchman, I heard he was; but I will
acquaint you more particularly to Mor∣row.</P>
<P>Accordingly
the next Day, he call'd to
the Watchman again, who told him that
he had enquired and found that poor
<HI>Molins</HI> the Porter was carried away by
the dead Carts, as they call'd them, the
Night before: He was surpriz'd exceed∣ingly
at this, and shut the Wooden-Door
immediately without speaking a Word
more to him; and going in sat him
down, griev'd most heartily, and wept by
himself a great while, to think that two
poor Men had thus lost their Lives as it
were to preserve him.</P>
<P>After sometime, he consider'd that there
was no room for him to be discourag'd, so
went to his Wife and took a large Glass
of <HI>Canary,</HI> which was his usual Cordial,
and putting as good a Countenance on
it as he cou'd, said nothing of the Death
of the poor Man to his Family; but
resolv'd to remain quietly in the Condi∣tion
he was in, and as it pleas'd God
that all his House continu'd in pretty
good Health, he consider'd that he had
great reason to be Comforted and thank∣ful
for that; and not to have any Sorrows
for others to affect his Mind.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="101"/>
In this posture he remain'd about a
Fortnight more, having no manner of
Correspondence with the Street, and he
had resolv'd to have no more Porters;
so he was perfectly without Intelligence,
except that still he found the Watch∣man
he had formerly talk'd with every
Day before the Door of the House as he
thought, where he was at first.</P>
<P>But after about a Fortnight, he grew
impatient with being so entirely without
Intelligence, and seeing none of the Week∣ly
Bills, nor knowing or hering any
thing but the doleful Noise of the Dead
Cart, and the Bell; at the end, I say,
of the Fortnight he open'd his Wooden
Window, and call'd to the Watchman,
ask'd him how he did▪ and how that
House did where he was plac'd, supposing
it the same where he was before? Alas!
Master, says the poor Man, the distress'd
Family are all dead and gone except the
Journeyman, and he is carried to the
<HI>Pest-House,</HI> and I am plac'd at Mr.—'<HI>s</HI>
at the next Door, and they have three
People Sick and one Dead.</P>
<P>He ask'd him then in General, how it
went in the City? He told him very
bad, that the last Weeks Bill was above
Eight Thousand of all Distempers, that it
Decreas'd at the other end of the Town
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
in St. <HI>Giles</HI> and in <HI>Holbourn,</HI> the People
being most of them Dead or gone away;
but that it Increas'd dreadfully towards
<HI>Aldgate</HI> and <HI>Stepney,</HI> and also in <HI>Southwark,</HI>
where it had been more moderate before
than in any other part of the Town.</P>
<P>In a Word, this being the middle of
<HI>September,</HI> the Plague was now in its ut∣most
Fury and Rage, only that as above
it was abated in the <HI>West</HI> end of the
Town where it began; and as the poor
Man told him, it had Decreased a
little in <HI>Cripple gate</HI> Parish, tho' there
still died in that Parish, between Four
and Five Hundred a Week, and in the
Parish of <HI>Stepney</HI> above Eight Hundred a
Week.</P>
<P>It was heavy News to this poor Gentle∣man,
to hear to what a dreadful Height
the Calamity was come; and yet it was
some Encouragement, that it begun to
go off to the <HI>Eastward,</HI> and that it had
Decreased so much in <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish,
and he fail'd not to let his Family know
it; but still as the Houses on both Sides
of him, and almost the whole Row on
the Side over against him were Distem∣pered,
and some whole Families Dead,
it was very terrible to them to think
how they yet liv'd in the midst of Death:</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="103"/>
His Family began now to be sorely
afflicted for want of Air for Breath, and
with continued Eating of Salt Meats, be∣gan
to grow Scorbutick and out of Order;
he did what he could by desiring them
stir and be active and busy about House to
preserve Health but would by no means
suffer any Window or Door to be o∣pened;
but as the Weather began to be
cooler than it had been, he continued to
keep Fires in every Room on that Floor
where they lodg'd, and had two of his
Family, who by turns sat up half a Night,
and two more the other half of the Night,
every Night to keep the Fires in, and
watch the House for fear of Mischief.</P>
<P>This Scorbutick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Increased pretty
much upon them but was greatly reliev'd
at last, by his accidental reading one Day
of People being Cur'd of the <HI>Scurvy</HI> at
our Islands of <HI>Antegoa</HI> or <HI>Mevis,</HI> by cating
Green <HI>Limons,</HI> after a long becalm'd Voyage
from <HI>Guinea:</HI> Upon this he remember'd
that he had a Quantity of <HI>Lime-juice</HI> and
<HI>Limon-juice</HI> in the House, which he gave
plentifully about to the Family, as often
as they would drink it, and in about a
Week or Ten Days time, they found
themselves sensibly better'd by the tak∣ing
it.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="104"/>
The Streets were now a melancholly
Sight to look into, the Pavement was
overgrown with Grass; it was not one
time in Twenty that they look'd thro'
the Glass, <HI>for they never open'd any Case∣ment,</HI>
that they could see any Body going
along, or so much as a Door open; as
for the Shops they were all shut close,
except that the <HI>Apothecaries</HI> and <HI>Chandlers∣shops,</HI>
kept a Door open for the letting
People come for what they wanted; not
a Coach or a Cart to be seen, exeept
now and then a Coach carrying a Sick
Body to the <HI>Pest-House;</HI> and every Night
three or four Times a Night, the Dead
Cart, with the Bell-man crying, <HI>Bring out
your Dead?</HI></P>
<P>The poor Man was now so Impatient
for want of his Porter, that he cou'd not
content himself without opening his
Wooden Window two or three Times
after this, to talk with the Watchman,
who continu'd posted at the Door of the
House that was shut up, and to inform
himself how things went; but at last he
look'd for him and found he was gone too,
which was a great Loss to him, and he
was the more troubl'd, because he in∣tended
to have given him some Money.</P>
<P>But one Day as he was looking thro'
the Glass, he spied the Man standing
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>
on the other Side of the Street, and look∣ing
up towards his House, upon which
he ran immediately to his Wooden Win∣dow,
and open'd it, tho' not forgetting
to make the usual Smoke with Gun∣powder
for his Preservation; when he
had opened the Door, the poor Watch∣man
told him he was glad to see him
still alive, and that he had come twice
before in hopes to see him, but was a∣fraid
he had not been well; that he came
to tell him, that he was dismiss'd from
the House he was set to Watch, most
of the poor People being Dead, and that if
he pleased to accept of it, he would sit
at his Door in the Day time, as his two
Porters had done.</P>
<P>He was glad of his Offer, for he had
not been casy for some time with being
without, so he answer'd him, that he
was glad to see him again, that he might
give him something for what he had done
for him, in telling him how things were;
so he threw the poor Man two Crowns,
for which he was very thankful; after
which he accepted his Offer, and he took
his post at the Door as the others had
done before, but he would not let him
go to the Post-house at all, or to any o∣ther
Place, only to give him Intelligence of
Things as he heard them among his Neigh∣bours.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106"/>
He had not been at the Door many
Days, but he call'd to his Master, and
told him that he was glad to give him
the good News that the Infection abated,
and that the <HI>Weekly-Bill</HI> was now Decrea∣sed
1837 in one Week, which had of a sud∣den
given a great deal of Joy among the
People; that the Burials in <HI>Cripplegate</HI>
Parish were sunk to within 200, tho'
in <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish they were still as high
as ever, being between Eight and Nine
Hundred</P>
<P>He fail'd not to run to his Wife and
Family with this good News, but was
fain to moderate it too, for that his
Sons began to be impatient to go abroad,
which however, he was resolv'd not to
suffer. This was about the last Week
in <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>The next Week his New Porter gave
him Notice that the Plague continu'd to
abate, that the <HI>Bill of Mortallity,</HI> was a∣gain
Decreased between Six and Seven
Hundred more, though they were yet
at a frightful Height, being 5725 in a
Week, of all Diseases.</P>
<P>However, it was a comfortable Thing
to think that the Violence of the Di∣stemper
began to asswage; and more es∣pecially,
that it abated in that part of
the City, for in this last Bill, the Burials in
<PB N="96" REF="107"/>
<HI>Cripplegate</HI> Parish of all Distempers, came
to but 196, which was but a very few
compar'd to 886 a Week, which had died
there a few Weeks before; So that the
Plague was as much ceas'd to them as
it would have been to the whole City,
if there had not died above 1000 or
1200 <HI>per</HI> VVeek.</P>
<P>His Sons would fain have had him now<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
like <HI>Noah,</HI> have sent out a <HI>Dove,</HI> that
is, to have let them have gone out of
Doors to have seen how Things were,
and how the City look'd; and they urg'd
him the more, because they began to
hear a Noise of People in the Streets
passing to and fro, and that pretty of∣ten;
but he kept his Guard, and would
not let any one stir out on any Terms,
or on any pretence whatsoever.</P>
<P>The next VVeek but two, which was the
third in <HI>October,</HI> there was another great
Decrease of 1849 in one <HI>Bill;</HI> and now his
Porter knock'd at his Door, they did
not open either Door or VVicket, but
spoke to him, and he told them, he de∣sir'd
to speak with his Master, to tell
him some good News: The Master of
the Family soon appear'd at his usual
Wooden Window with one of his Sons
and one of his Daughters, the Watch∣man
told him, that now he hop'd he
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>
could assure him, that the Visitation
was really going off; that there had died
1849 less the last Week than the Week
before, and that the <HI>Lord Mayor</HI> had or∣der'd
the Carts to cease going about, ex∣cept
twice a Week in several Parts of
the City, and in others but once each
Night; and that there had died but 88
in <HI>Cripple gate</HI> Parish that Week of all
Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; that indeed it continu'd very
high in <HI>Stepney,</HI> and especially in <HI>South∣wark;</HI>
but that in the City it was ex∣treamly
abated.</P>
<P>He let down to the poor Man, for his
good News, a Pint Bottle of good <HI>Sack,</HI>
and a small Basket with Provisions or
him and his Family. And now they
turn'd their two Days of Fasting, which
they had constantly kept in the Family
every Week, into one Day of Fasting,
and one Day of Thank giving, when on
the sudden, to the great Surprize of
the whole Family, the Master himself,
who was the Life and Spring of all the
Rest, and of all the Management, which
under God, had so evidently preserv'd
them, I say the Master himself was taken
very Sick.</P>
<P>It is not for me at this Distance, to
describle the terrible Consternation they
were all in; not only the whole Family,
<PB N="98" REF="109"/>
but the Master himself concluded he
was struck with the Plague; and the
Apprehension, least he should be the
means to give it to any of his Children,
he would oblige them to have him car∣ry'd
out to the <HI>Pest-House;</HI> his Wife and
all the Children declar'd against it, and
protested to him every one of them, that
they would rather have the Distemper
with him, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave the Consequence to
God's Mercy.</P>
<P>With these importunities he was pre∣vai'ld
with, but order'd a Bed to be
made immediately in one of the upper
Rooms, mention'd before, and went pre∣sently
to Bed; taking such Things as
were prescrib'd publickly by the <HI>College</HI> of
<HI>Physicians,</HI> to be given at any ones being
first taken with the Plague, which was
to provoke Sweat; upon taking these
Things he fell into a violent Sweat im∣mediately,
and continu'd so all Night:
Any one may suppose the Family had but
little Sleep that Night; being in the ut∣most
Concern for so careful and so kind
a Father, as also very anxious to know
whether their Father had the Distemper
or no.</P>
<P>No more can I represent lively enough
the Joy there was in the House, when
the next Day they found their Father
<PB N="99" REF="110"/>
had Sweated very violently, fallen into
a good Sleep after it, and was so much
refresh'd and so well, as to satisfy them
all, that his Distemper was not at all
Infectious; but that it rather proceeded
from the great Weight and Pressure of his
Cares, which had been too heavy for
his Spirits, and withal, having taken some
Cold as they thought, by standing too
long talking at the Wooden Window
to his Watchman.</P>
<P>In short, the Sweating had reliev'd him
effectually, and in two or three Days he
was about House again and tolerably well,
tho' weak by Sweating a little too much.</P>
<P>While the Master of the House lay
thus, the Family had no Joy of the De∣crease
of the Plague; for what was the
Decrease to them if it broke out now
in their own House? but as soon as the
Master recover'd a little, then they began
to look abroad again for Intelligence:
And now they cou'd see through their
Windows a new Countenance of things in
the Streets and upon the Houses; that the
People began to go up and down the
Streets very frequently; and some be∣gan
to open their Shops, at least to o∣pen
them half way; the <HI>Hackney-Coaches</HI>
also were heard rumbling in the Streets,
so that without calling to the Porter,
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
they cou'd easily perceive that the Di∣stemper
was greatly Decreased and that
the People that were left, bad more
Courage than before, and in a word that
the Plague was going off, at least in the
City, and <HI>Chiesly</HI> on that Side where
they liv'd.</P>
<P>Their Porter or Watchman confirm'd
it to them the next Day, when the <HI>Week∣ly
Bill</HI> came about, which he brought
to them: The Master contented himself
with hearing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow it was, but would not
let the Bill be taken in▪ nor would he
yet abate one tittle of his strict Guarding
his Family from Conversing with the
Streets by any means.</P>
<P>It was now the last Week in <HI>October,</HI>
and so greatly was the Plague Decrea∣sed,
that there was but 22 Buried of it
in all <HI>Cripple-gate</HI> Parish, and but 20 the
Week before, which was almost as surpriz∣ing
as the great rise of it at first; t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o'
even this Week the <HI>Bills</HI> were high in
<HI>Stepney</HI> Parish and in <HI>Southwark</HI> also.</P>
<P>Now though this was joyful News to
this, as well as to other Families, yet
he was as anxious about the Danger of
opening his Doors too soon, as he was
before of keeping them open at first too
long: He was a ware that People would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he rash in their Joy, and that preluming
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
on the Health of the City being re-esta∣blish'd,
they would return to their Houses
and bring out their Goods, on which o∣thers
had died and air them, too soon,
and so perhaps bring back the Infections:
And it was just as he had said, for about
the middle of <HI>November,</HI> the <HI>Bills</HI> on a
sudden Increased 400 at once, and rose
from a Thousand to Fourteen Hundred,
and the City was in a terrible Fright
upon that Occasion.</P>
<P>But it pleas'd God that it went off a∣gain,
and the Weather coming in Cool,
the Distemper abated again, and the <HI>Bills</HI>
continu'd Decreasing till in the third Week
of <HI>November</HI> they were once more under
a Thousand a Week of all Distempers,
where of but 652 of the Plague.</P>
<P>It is true, that considering the Number
of People who were dead, which was very
near an Hundred Thousand, and the
great Number sled away, which accord∣ing
to the most moderate Guess, was at∣least
three times as many; considering the
Numbers who had had the Distemper and
were recover'd, who though, <HI>as was Evi∣dent
in the Case of the Second Porter,</HI> they
were not entirely free from the return
of the Distemper, yet were not so very
easi'y Infected as others. I say, consider∣ing
this, the dying of 652 a Week now,
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
was as much as the dying of 2000 a
Week, was at the beginning of <HI>August;</HI>
and this made him continue his Caution
with the same Rigour as ever, and in∣deed
with rather more; for he remem∣ber'd
well what a Consternation the Peo∣ple
were every where in, when the Plague
was so increased, as to die from Eight
Hundred to a Thousand a Week of all
Distempers, and even this Week I now
speak of, which was from the 14th of
<HI>November,</HI> to the 21st, the <HI>Bill</HI> stood at
905, whereof 652 of the Plague.</P>
<P>Besides, there died in the City of
the Plague that very Week above twice
the Number as did in the Week from
21st to the 28th of <HI>July,</HI> when the <HI>Bill</HI>
was 1761 in all; for then there died but
56 in all the City within the Walls,
whereas now there died 127, I mean of
the Plague: So that the City was not
so Healthy then as the Out-parts: <HI>For
Example,</HI> The great Parish of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI>
was so strangely restored, that there died
in the Week from the 21st to the 28th
of <HI>November,</HI> no more than 10 Perions
in all, and but two of them of the Plague;
which perhaps was the least Number that
has been known in that Parish before
or since, for above an Hundred Years.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="114"/>
All these Things he Calculated exactly,
and as he said, was very loth to lose all
the Fruit of his Care and Caution; and
of the close Confinement he had submit∣ted
to: I say he was very loth to lose it
all at once, by a rash and needless Ad∣venture:
His Reasons were so good,
and their own Safety so much concern'd
in it, that his Family submitted to it
with the more Chearfulness, though they
began to labour hard for Breath at that
time, and to be very desirous of Air,
having been shut up so close and so long
as above.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>December,</HI> like <HI>Noah,</HI> who
opened the Window of the Ark▪ to send
out his <HI>Dove,</HI> he opened his Street Door
for the first time and walk'd out: The
<HI>Bill</HI> of <HI>Montality</HI> the Week be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore was 544
of all Diseases, whereof only 333 of the
Plague, where of near half of that Num∣ber
were out of <HI>Stepney</HI> Parish, and the
<HI>Southwark</HI> Side of the River where the
Sickness continued longest, and was
longest before it began.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>December,</HI> I say he walk'd
out, but suffer'd none of his Family to
stir but himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; he view'd the Streets,
the Houses and Shops, but convers'd with
no Body, nor did he see any Body that
he knew, except a few just in his own
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
Neighbourhood; a vast Number of Houses
were standing empty and deserted, the
Inhabitants being gone into the Country;
yet in some of those he observ'd Servants
return'd, who had opened the Windows
and Doors, and were, as we call it, Airing
the Houses and the Goods, making Fires
in all the Rooms, opening the Windows,
and burning Persumes in the Rooms, pre∣paring
them in that manner for the
Return of the Families that belong'd to
them.</P>
<P>The Numbers of People in the Streets
were greater indeed than he expected;
but this seem'd to be occasion'd rather
by the Curiosity of the People, which
were left, which led them to go more a∣broad
than otherwise they wou'd have
done, for in the Back-streets and Ways,
less frequented, he found very few Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>He came home again in a few Hours,
not having visited any Body, or 'm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de any
Enquiries after any of his Friends, or
any one else; and resolv'd to keep up to
his Close Quarters one Week longer; nor
would he buy any fresh Provisions, or
suffer any one to go to Market; but
resolv'd upon some new Measures which
he put in Practice the Week following. He
went out early in the Morning and taking
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
his Eldest Son and his Apprentice with
him, they walk'd on Foot as sar as <HI>Totten∣ham-High-Cross,</HI>
and finding a House there
of one of his Acquaintance, which had
not been Infected at all, he took Lodg∣ings
or Apartments in it for his whole
Family, and the same Day return'd to
<HI>London:</HI> The same Week he remov'd them
all thither, carrying his own Goods and
some part of his own Provisions; all which
he caused to be fetch'd by Waggons
belonging to the Country People, and
such as he had good Information were
Sound, and had not been Infected at all.</P>
<P>Here he not only reliev'd his Fa∣mily
with fresh Air, which they so much
wanted, but with fresh Provisions also,
which he had now brought to them from
<HI>Waltham Market,</HI> by his old Higgler who
had supply'd the Family at the begin∣ning
of the Year.</P>
<P>He left his House at <HI>London</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast lock'd
up, except the Gate into his Yard, the
Key of which he gave to the Honest
Watchman, and went himself, or his Son,
or his Apprentice, two or three times a
Week, to see that every thing was safe
and in good order: And thus he con∣tinu'd
till the <HI>February</HI> following; for all the
Month of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>January</HI> the Plague
continued in the City, and at the latter
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>
end of <HI>December</HI> it began to Increase again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
which was believ'd to be by the People's
returning faster than ordinary to their
Dwellings; so that the third Week in
<HI>December,</HI> the Number Encreased was 83,
and then there died of the Plague still
281, the whole Bill being 525.</P>
<P>But by the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> the
Family being well recover'd and re∣fresh'd,
and all in perfect Health, and
the City being fill'd again with People,
and in pretty good State of Health, he
remov'd all back again, and came to his
House, open'd his Doors, and carry'd
on his Business as before.</P>
<P>Thus, next, under the Protection of
God's Providence, a compleat Retirement
from the Street and from Conversing on
any account whatever with the rest of
the People separating from them, and
having, <HI>as we may say,</HI> nothing to do with
them neither to Buy or Sell, or speak
or sit with or near them, has been ap∣prov'd
to be capable of effectually pre∣serving
a Man or a Family, in the
Time of an Infection.</P>
<P>I will not suppose this Man or his
Family, who were so severe in Fasting
and Humbling themselves before God,
all the time they were under Appre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensions
of the Distemper, and surround∣ed
<PB N="107" REF="118"/>
with daily Experience of the dread∣ful
Calamity that lay upon the City,
cou'd so far forget themselves now, as
not to give God Thanks in the most
solemn Manner possible for their Deli∣verance:
That part I take for granted;
they cou'd not be rational Creatures any
more than Christians, and retain no sense
of so signal Preservation. I will therefore, I
say, take that for granted, and suggest, that
the Master of the Family with the ut∣most
Seriousness and Devotion perform'd
this part, and that he oblig'd all his Fa∣mily
to do the like.</P>
<P>Here is now a perfect Rule for any
one to walk by, and to preserve them∣selves
against the most violent Infection
that ever yet happen'd in this Nation,
for such I esteem that plague to be: And
I judge it by this, that although we call
it a Plague Year, and that the Number
of Persons that died, is accounted to the
whole Year, that is, from the 20th of
<HI>December,</HI> 1664, to the 20th of <HI>December</HI>
1665; yet the gross part of the Number
perish'd within the Compass of less than
four Months: Namely, from the 18th
of <HI>July</HI> to the 14th of <HI>November,</HI> in which
time there died 81559 People of all Di∣stempers;
whereas the whole Number in
the Twelve Months as by the Yearly Bills
<PB N="108" REF="119"/>
amounts to but 97306: Or take it of the
Numbers reckon'd to die of the Plague
and brought in so by the <HI>Bill of Morta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lity,</HI>
the whole Number that died of the
Plague in the Year, from the 20th of <HI>De∣cember</HI>
1664 to the 19th of <HI>December</HI> 1665
was 68596, whereof there died in the
Compass of the 4 Months above men∣tioned,
from the 18th of <HI>July</HI> to the 14th
of <HI>November,</HI> 65045: So that in the whole
seven Months of <HI>January, February, March,
April, May, June,</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> and half
<HI>July</HI> and half <HI>November,</HI> their died of the
Plague 3551 and no more.</P>
<P>Again in Nine Weeks of these four
Months, the Violence of this Contagion
was indeed most dreadful, and beyond all
that ever was before in this Nation:
<HI>For Example,</HI> From the 8th of <HI>August</HI> to
the 10th of <HI>October,</HI> there was Burned
60410 Persons, an incredible Number<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
if we consider, that by the Judgment of
all that have been seriou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly inquisitive in
that Matter, the <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Mortallity</HI> neither
did, nor was it possible as Circumstances
were then known to be, that they shou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
give a full Account of the Numbers of
People that perish'd in that dreadful
Calamity: Many perish'd in the Pields
and High-ways, wandering in their Distress,
and Desperation from the Town, desolate
<PB N="109" REF="120"/>
and not knowing whither to go; the
Villages adjacent also refusing to suffer
them to come in, or to give them any
shelter, Thousands perish'd in those
Towns adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> which are
not included in the <HI>Bills</HI> of <HI>Mortallity;</HI>
which were notwithstanding Crowded
with People who fled thither from <HI>London</HI>
in the beginning of the Infection, expect∣ing
Safety there; which however, the
Distemper being so violent, was little
Protection to them, and they rather as∣sisted
to make those Towns more un∣healthy
than they would perhaps have
otherwise been: These Towns are said to
have Buried above 5000 People, some
think many more, such as follows,

<P><PB N="110" REF="121"/>
Yet in this dreadful Visitation, a re∣treat
has been effectual in the very City,
and doubtless would still be so, if manag'd
with the same Prudence at another time.</P>
<P>Here is the Example: The Pattern
contains compleat Directions: And I
cannot doubt, but if the same method
were taken by any Family, the same Se∣curity
would, by the Blessing of God, be
obtained.</P>
<P>I am to observe, that whereas this
Gentleman laid in a Magazine of Stores
sufficient for his Family: I mean of Pro∣visions
for a whole Year; so as he was
not shut up above seven Months or
thereabouts, he had a great quantity of
Biscuit, Beer, Cheese, Beef and other things
remaining.</P>
<P>If his Stores were short in any thing,
it was in fine Flower, and Butter; but
the Reason was not, that he had not
duly proportion'd every thing for an
equal Supply; but that his Wife, his
Children, and indeed Servants and all,
having not been us'd to the Coarse hard
Biscuit-Bread, could at first scarce bite it
with their Teeth; and contriv'd abun∣dance
of small things, Puddings and Pies,
and Cakes of several sorts, and Bread,
such as their own little Oven would Bake,
only that wanting Yeast, they could not
<PB N="111" REF="122"/>
supply themselves with such Bread as
they usually had, but were oblig'd to
make it heavy and sad, not knowing
how to leaven their Bread, as some
Countries do. On the other Hand they
mingl'd Butter, and sometimes fine Oil
with their Flower, and made abundance
of bak'd Things to supply the Place of
Bread; and this was the Reason of their
Flower not holding out so well as their
Bread.</P>
<P>However, as I may suppose when he
brought his Family home again, and the
Markets were open and provisions came in
plenty again, and might be eaten freely,
he brought out what was left of his Maga∣zine,
that is to say, of the Eatables and
Liquids, and made a Thanks-offering of
it to the Poor, nor was it a small quan;
tity in the whole, seeing he had left.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1500 Ib. Weight of Bread.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 Hogsheads of his Beer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>300 Ib. Weight of Cheese.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 Flitches of Bacon</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Barrels and a piece of Salted Beef.</ITEM>
<ITEM>No Pork and no Butter or Flower.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>This Account is given the more large∣ly,
because it may stand as a Mark of
Direction, which will not merit any Ex∣ception
<PB N="112" REF="123"/>
in the Manner. And I can assure
my Reader, that several Families have
been preserved in this late dreadful Plague
at <HI>Marscilles</HI> by the same Method; and I
have seen Letters from thence full of the
Particulars, and acknowledging the Success.</P>
<P>It is true that the poorer Inhabitants
are not able to do thus, and therefore
this Example or this Advice, does not
immediately reach to them. But as in
the first part of this Work, I have men∣tion'd
what Care might, and indeed
ought to be taken of the Poor; <HI>viz.</HI> to re∣move
their Wives and Children, to keep
and succour them in particular, separa∣ting
them from the rest. I say, that then
would the remaining Inhabitants, who
were able thus to retreat, do it in the
manner as is here described, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y would
necessarily employ so many of the Men
who should remain as Porters and Watch∣men
at their Doors, and subsist them
with Provisions from within, that even
those poor Men would no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be expos'd to
the Conversing with one another, which
is the fatal part, in such Extremities
as these.</P>
<P>It is nothing but the Necessity of
going about among one another, which
prompts the Contagion, and extends it
into every Coner of the City; if the Poor
<PB N="113" REF="124"/>
cou'd live within Doors, as the Rich may,
the Poor would be as safe as the Rich
are, but that Necessity that sends them
abroad to get their Bread, brings them
home Infected.</P>
<P>It is not so much the Poor living
close and not cleanly that Infects them,
their dirty Clothes and uncomfortable
Lodgings, and hard Fare, does not give
them the Plague, does not Infect them,
if so, they would never be without it;
I will not say but it makes their Cure
more difficult, and want of Food and
of Physick makes them sink under it,
when they have it; but it is their going
abroad among one another that infects
them, and then want of Conveniences,
and of being assisted and lock'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter,
causes them to perish fuster than others.</P>
<P>The whole Scheme o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Discourse
therefore, aims at separating the People
as much as possible from one another;
and on this depends their Safety and
Health; I mean as to second Causes and
the means of preserving it: As to the A∣gency
of Providence, I am no way In∣vading
it, or Impeaching the Wisdom of
Heaven in the directing these Things.</P>
<P>I must say, I reject (though with
D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cency) the Notions of those People
who take upon them to tell us, that the,
<PB N="114" REF="125"/>
Plague is not convey'd by Contagion from
the Bodies Infected; it seems to me to
be an Ill-grounded Hypothesis, argued up∣on
as the Persons who espouse those
Notions think fit; and as the Opinion is
boldly advanc'd against the Universal Ex∣perience
of Mankind for many Ages,
I leave them to be confuted by the same
Experience.</P>
<P>However to avoid Caviling or making
this Work, which is written with a better
Design, a Scene of Debate, I leave them
to their own Notions, and those that
please to believe them, may venture
their Lives upon the Faith of it, if they
think fit; but I believe few will, and in
the mean time, I acknowledge as at the
beginning, that I write this upon a Suppo∣sition
of the common Hypothesis, name∣ly,
That the Distemper is what we call
Catching or Contagious, that is to say,
The Sound are Infected by the Sick; let
it be in what manner they please, whe∣ther
by Effluvia from their Bodies; by
Animalcula mixt and drawn into our
Bodies with our Breath; or by the
Venome of the Tumours, Blanes and
Sores, or how you please; and that Con∣versing
with those who are Infected gives
the Infection, which is propagated in that
manner, from one to another: I say,
<PB N="115" REF="126"/>
I lay down this as a Principle, which Ex∣perience
and the Judgment of very able
Physicians, and Men of long Practice
confirms to me; whose Authority I must
needs say, I have not yet seen overthrown,
and as the History I have given of a Fa∣mily
preserv'd by retiring from Conver∣sation,
is really the History of several
Familes, rather than of one, and is a
perfect Model for future Practice. I
think that Account with several others,
which I cou'd give, within the Com∣pass
of my own Knowledge, or the
Particulars whereof I have had from
the Persons of Credit. I say, these
are convincing Proofs, to me at least,
of what I build upon, namely, That
the Distemper is taken by Contagion
from the diseas'd Bodies, let those who
believe otherwise act as they see fit;
but let them remember that they cannot
say they have wanted due Caution, de∣riv'd
from innumerable Examples of
those who have been Infected by their
Conversing with others.</P>
<P>I must confess, I think, the publishing
such a vast variety of Opinions in this
Case, as we see every Day brought to
light, is like publishing the Cavils and
Opinions of Divines, in the great Dispute
about the <HI>Trinity,</HI> dangerous instead of di∣recting
<PB N="116" REF="127"/>
to the Readers; amusing the Peo∣ple
so, that (th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ugh in the most important
Article of Religion) they know not
what to conclude, or which Opinion to
accept</P>
<P>In like manner here, in the most im∣portant
Article of our Health, we are so
perplex'd with the Opinions of the Pay∣sicians;
some declaring the Plague not
dangerous one way, and some that it is
not dangerous another way; while by
common Experience, we find it dange∣rous
every way and this carried up to such
a Degree as it is, that we know not whom
to follow, or whom to give Credit to.</P>
<P>My short Judgment, and which I leave
to experience, is this; That be the Bo∣dies
of Sick Persons Infectious or not, be
it safe to Visit and Converse with them,
or be it not, Things which we may
never determine in Theory; this is cer∣tain,
that in declining Conversation with
the Sick nay in declining all Communi∣cation
with one another, in time of In∣fection,
there can be but little Error,
and 'tis the much safer Way for all
People to act; In the Negative there
can be no Danger, the retreat then,
which I recommend, must be acknow∣ledg'd
to be the most innocent mistake
that any Man or Family can commit.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="128"/>
It is a fine Notion, if I had said a
fine spun Notion, I had been excusable, to
say that we are in no danger of Infection
from Conversing with infected Bodies;
But who do these Gentlemen think they
shall perswade to run the Hazard of the
Experiment? Nay, will the Gentlemen
themselves show us the Way? and if they
should we must see through the whole
Visitation, before we can tell whether
they are in the right or no.</P>
<P>Nay, if it should happen that any
bold Adventurer should thus Hazard
the Experiment and live, even then it
does not prove the Thing to be true,
for he may live and not be Infected, and
yet I may catch it at the first At∣tempt
and be lost. Perhaps this Man's
Constitution, or Precautions, or particular
Conduct, or his Fate, may prevent his be∣ing
Infected, but yours or mine may not:
I here are infinite Numbers perish in a
Plague, that is true, and this convinces
us that it is a Contagion convey'd from
and catched of one another, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet in
the hott<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st and highest Infection that e∣ver
was, some have escaped and never
been Infected at all, although they may
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve liv'd among the infected Bodies all
the time: I knew a Sexton and Bearer
of a Parish in <HI>London,</HI> who Dug ali the
<PB N="118" REF="129"/>
Graves and help'd to carry all the Bo∣dies
that were carried in Coffins to the
Grave, in the whole Parish he liv'd in,
and yet never had the Distemper, and the
like Instances of many others; but this is
as far from proving that the Distemper
is not Infecting, as it proves that Musquet
Bullets do not Kill Men in an Army,
because all that are Shot at or Wounded
do not die.</P>
<P>Some ascribe it the goodness of Pro∣vidence,
and to a mercifull Disposition for
the Comfort of the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> at
that time, that the Persons necessary to
tend the Sick, to bury the Dead, and to
assist in publick Matters were preserved,
and very seldom had the Plague; as
Nurses in the very Chambers of the Sick,
and in the <HI>Pest-Houses, Hospitals,</HI> &amp;c.
Cart-Drivers and Bell Men that carried
away the dead Bodies in the Night, and
Grave Diggers who assisted to bury them,
and the like; and as it was said, Market,
People who brought Provisions to Market,
and who, they say, never had the Distemper.</P>
<P>But (I) With due deference to Oral
Tradition this is a mistake; it is true
poor People press'd by their own Cir∣cumstances,
Trade and Workmanship be∣ing
at a kind of full Stop, were glad for
Bread at any Hazard, to undertake those
<PB N="119" REF="130"/>
dangerous and dismal Offices of tending
the Sick, and burying the Dead; and in
many Cases the Magistrates of the Ci∣ty
oblig'd them to do it; but then it
must be acknowledg'd, that many did
catch the Distemper, and many of them
died, though as in other Cases, not all
of them.</P>
<P>(2.) After the Sickness had been some∣time
among us, as in all Infections some
died, so in this some had been in∣fected
and recover'd; and tho' it is
true, that it did not perfectly secure
them from a Relapse, or from having
it a second or a third time, or oftner
as was found by Experience; yet it was
a general Notion with the People that
they cou'd not have it twice, and that
made such as had recover'd, be the bold∣er
in offering themselves to those Works;
and perhaps too they were not so easily
Infected as others were, tho' they were
not wholly secur'd; so that by the time
that the Plague was come to its height
most of the Nurses and necessary People
above, were made up of such as had been
infected and were recovered; and this
particular Circumstance recommended
them to the Families they were employ'd
in, because they then thought they were
safe from losing the Nurse they had de∣pended
<PB N="120" REF="131"/>
on, having her die in the House,
or having her carried away, when she
was most wanted, and, perhaps not any
other to be had.</P>
<P>So that upon the whole, those Peo∣ple
not dying as others did, is very far
from being a convincing reason that the
Plague was not Contagious, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as to
the Market People, Higglers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who
brought Provisions to <HI>London,</HI> being so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignally preserved by Heaven, in Mercy
to the distress'd Citizens, that none of
them had the Plague, or carried it home
to their Families. I would be very far
from lessening so great and valuable a
Memorial of merciful Heaven, and of his
Care for the Good of his afflicted Crea∣tures,
if I was sure of the Fact; but as
I have never met with sufficient Autho∣rity
for the Thing or had it prov'd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so
as I might depend upon the Truth of it,
I shall say no more than this to it, that
as those who relate it, look upon it to
be little less than miraculous, so as such
I should receive it, if it was prov'd to be
true; but if it were true, it neither way
proves that the Distemper was not Catching.</P>
<P>But to come a little nearer home, if
this were true, what mean the Physicians
and the Government in <HI>France</HI> at this
time? And what are they doing there, in
<PB N="121" REF="132"/>
surrounding the Towns which are Visited
with their Soldiers, keeping in the Sound
with the Sick till they all Perish toge∣ther?
What need of the dreadful Seve∣rities
they have used there, in Shooting
dead so many Innocent People, who (made
desperate by their Danger) have attemp∣ted
to Escape, either by Force or Secretly,
and to get away if possible, out of the
Danger? If the poor desperate Creatures
did not see, that to be lock'd up there a∣mong
the Infected People was present
Death to them; and that they would be
unavoidably infected and lost, what
pushes them upon such desperate At∣tempts
for escape? in which they are al∣most
sure to be discover'd, and if dis∣cover'd,
are sure to be kill'd without
Mercy. I say, what can push them up∣on
such desperate Things, but the ap∣parent
Knowledge of the Distemper being
catching from the Bodies of their Friends
who were Infected.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, why such Severi∣ties,
nay, Cruelties and Barbarites (for if
there was no reason for them, they must
be call'd such) as shooting to Death two
poor Innocent Children, who in meer
Duty to their distress'd Father, who lay
Sick in the Mountains, found means
to pass the Lines in <HI>Dauphine</HI> in the
<PB N="122" REF="133"/>
Night, and go to him to carry him Re∣lief:
Which two poor Children, one 13
Years old and one 14, were shot with∣out
Mercy, and against the Entreaties
and Cries of the very Inhabitants where
they were taken? What need <HI>I say</HI> of such
inexorable Cruelty, if Necessity and the
just fear of Infection from the Bodies of
those miserable Creatures, did not make
it justifiable?</P>
<P>I might instance in many other Acts
of sevcrity; such as shooting five Soldiers
who had the Guard of the Lines, for ha∣ving
persued two Sheep, to Kill them
within the Lines, least they should get
back and Infect the Country; so that
the poor Men were Kill'd for their extraor∣dinary
dilligence in their Duty; there are
more Stories of the like Nature, which we
have had publickly Printed and Written;
but as I cannot depend on the Truth
of the Particulars, I omit them; the gene∣ral
Part, namely, that they do practise
these Things, and do shoot and put to
Death all that attempt to Escape, if
they come within their Reach, is un∣doubted.</P>
<P>Now 'tis certain, the <HI>French</HI> who are a
Nation of Humanity, would never Ex∣ercise
such Severities upon their own
People<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I mean they would not as a Na∣tion,
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>
and as a Government under whole∣some
Laws, if they were not fully satis∣fy'd
that the Contagion of this Distem∣per
is thus convey'd from the Bodies of
the Infected, to the Bodies of the Sound;
and that it was dangerous for the Sound
to Converse with the Sick.</P>
<P>This Opinon of theirs, 'tis evident
all their Physicians come into, and it is
allow'd that the <HI>French</HI> Court is not ill
furnish'd with Gentlemen that have
made the greatest Proficiency in the
Knowledge of Medicine, and in the Study
of Distempers, of any Nation what soever.</P>
<P>Nor is it the Opinion of the Physicians
there only, but the same Notion is en∣tertain'd
by all the Christian World,
as appears by the Prohibiting Commerce,
and even Conversation with any Person
coming from <HI>France:</HI> which it is plain
proceeds from the Apprehensions, least
those Persons should be already Infected
with the Distemper, and should Com∣municate
it from their particular Bodies
to the People they come among.</P>
<P>Now if it was true, as these Men in∣finuate,
that no Contagion can be con∣vey'd
from one Body to another; then
all the Nations in <HI>Christendom</HI> proceed at
present upon wrong Notions; all the Peo∣ple
they Kill in the Severities I speak of,
<PB N="124" REF="135"/>
are unjustly and injuriously Kill'd; and
there are just so many cold Blood Mur∣thers
committed by them; like wise all the
Measures taken to keep the People in
the places Infected, from coming among
the People that are Sound and not In∣fected,
are ridiculous, and to no purpose.</P>
<P>I shall say no more to this Matter,
the contrary is an Amusement, and, if
I may give my Opinion, cannot extend
very far, nor will the Gentlemen that have
advanc'd it, I believe, get many Friends
to it, at least not such as will venture
their Lives upon the Credit of the Opinion.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, if I go on a mi∣stake,
I err in much good Company, for
I have the Practice of the whole Christian
World on my Side: Nay, tho' I were
to grant it was a mistake, <HI>which however,
I can by no means do,</HI> yet I am right in
my Proposals, in that I am laying down
Rules for the Preservation of Mankind,
upon the Foot of that same Principle
which they all go upon; <HI>Namely,</HI> that of
the Distemper being Insectious, that is to
say, That the Infection is taken from one
to another by the Infected Bodies emit∣ing
poisonous Particles, either from
the Pores of the Body, or from the Breath,
or from some malignant Effluvia which
pass from the Body Infected, and are
<PB N="125" REF="136"/>
receiv'd by the Body at that time to be
Infected: When the World may, by the
introducing this new Opinion, change
their Methods universally, then and not
before the Scheme I lay down may be
Voted useless. I might proceed to some
common Remedies or Preservatives, which
have been found useful in times of In∣fection
to those whose Circumstances would
not permit them to retire from Com∣pany,
and from Conversing with their
Neighbours: But our Physicianes, have
Crowded the World with Medicines, as
well Simple as Compound; and there is
no room to say any thing after them:
However, as I have no Notion, I must con∣fess,
of venturing among Infected People
without any Preservative, I cannot but
mention some of them; I have known that
some have preserv'd themselves in the last
Plague 1665, by only having a Bottle of
<HI>Vinegar</HI> in their Hands, and being con∣tinually
smelling to it: I my self have
rid thro'a Town Infected with the Plague,
with a Bunch of <HI>Rue</HI> in my Mouth and
have been secur'd, others have taken
<HI>Rue</HI> and <HI>Wormwood</HI> together. I know a
Physician who Visited several Patients,
even in the <HI>Pest-House</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> in
1665, and went sreely into their Cham∣bers,
but all the while he was in the
<PB N="126" REF="137"/>
Rooms would be Chewing a Stalk of <HI>An∣gelica</HI>
in his Mouth, and every Morning
before he went among them, drank the
Quantity of an ordinary Glass of <HI>Canary,</HI>
with the Stalk of <HI>Angelica</HI> steep'd in it,
and he never was Infected so as to be
quite Sick with it.</P>
<P>Innumerable such Prescriptions were
to be had, built on the Experience of
many who have practis'd them; but no∣thing
of all this ever comes up to the
grand Experiment, which I have recom∣mended
in this Work. I mean that of
separating ourselves, and retiring whol∣ly
from Conversation, whether in Fami∣lies
or otherwise, and laying in Store of
Provisions, to shut themselves as entire∣ly
up as if <HI>Lord have Mercy,</HI> and <HI>a Cross</HI>
was set on their Door.</P>
<P>Frequent Sweatings by those that are
retir'd as above, cannot but be very
useful to them, as well for preventing the
Mischiefs which frequently follow upon
being too closely confin'd, and want of
Air, as to keep the Body from any mis∣chief
receiv'd, or like to be receiv'd
from the nearness of the Contagion; but
then those Sweatings should be very mo∣derate
and gentle, and chiefly occasion'd
by some little Stirring and Exercise,
such as running up and down Stairs,
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>
or any brisk Motion, but with a stric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Reserve against over tireing the Spirits o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
heating the Blood.</P>
<P>I object nothing against the Medicines
prescrib'd by the Physicians. Every one
will act in that Case as their Opinion of the
several Physicians they use prompts them;
all that I have thought needful of that kind;
I have tied down to Preparative Physick,
as above, what is to be done when the Dis∣aster
is come, when the Body is Infected,
and the Distemper has seiz'd the Blood,
that is not the Business or Design of this
Undertaking, nor does it come within the
Compass of what we call Preparations.</P>
<P>When the Blood is once Tainted, and
the Body Infected, Preparations are then
at an end: Then you must look upon the
Fortress as effectually Besieg'd and formal∣ly
Attack'd, and you must muster up
all the Strength of Nature, and Art
for your Relief.</P>
<P>But this is not my Part, as I have said;
but having brought up the several states
of Health to this length, I leave it to
talk of the other Part: I mean <HI>Prepara∣tions
for the Plague;</HI> what Preparations I
have mention'd yet, are such as are
needful to preserve the Body from the
Plague: And when the Person has the
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
Plague really upon him; I have no
more to say but this, he must turn his
Thoughts another Way, <HI>viz.</HI> he must
make Preparations for Death: I see no∣thing
else before him, nor ought he to
expect any thing else. And this brings
me to the Second Part of my Work.</P>
</DIV1>

<PB N="129" REF="140"/>
<HEAD>PREPARATIONS
FOR THE
PLAGUE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS is the hardest part of the
Work by far: But of the
two, infinitely of greater Con∣sequence;
as the enternal State
into which we are all to pass
from this Life, is of more Consequence
than the present State.</P>
<P>Life and Time are indeed of an in∣estimable
Value, but they are only so
or principally so, as on the happy Con∣clusion
of them, depends the eternal
Welfare of the Person to whom they
are so valuable; and especially, the Pre∣parations
for an Eternal State, are only
<PB N="130" REF="141"/>
to be made in time, which once slip'd
away, lost and unapply'd, is irrecovera∣bly
lost for ever.</P>
<P>The Approaches of Death, are often∣times
inperceptible, and the Attacks sud∣den;
the Distempers by which we are
carried away are violent; and it is a double
Terror to the dying Person to have the
Work of dying and the Work of Re∣pentance
both upon his Hands together.
O Sinner! remmember that the Terrors
of thy Conscience will be a Weight too
heavy to be born at the same time
with the Terrors of Death: Nay, the
Terrors of Conscience, are those alone
which give Terrors to Death, which
make the Passage out of Life dreadful;
and these many times make a Disease
Mortal, which would not otherwise be
so: Were the Diseases and Casualties of
which People frequently die in this po∣pulous
City rightly given into the
<HI>Bills of Mortallity,</HI> many would be set down
of other Distempers, than as we find
them: Instead of <HI>Hang'd themselves</HI> (being
Distracted) and <HI>Cut their own Throats</HI> (be∣ing
Distracted) it would be said, <HI>Hang'd
themselves</HI> (being in Despair) and <HI>Cut their
own Throats</HI> (being in dreadful trouble of
Mind) instead of <HI>pain in the Head,</HI> it
would be said, <HI>pain in the Mind,</HI> instead of
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>
<HI>Convulsions,</HI> it would be said, <HI>Horror of
Conscience,</HI> and the like: I doubt not
but these Horrors I speak of, throw the
Body into <HI>Fevers</HI> and <HI>Convulsions,</HI> and at
least assist those Distempers to destroy us:
It is enough to have a violent <HI>Fever</HI>
drink up the Moisture and Life, and
not to have the Arrows of the Almighty
<HI>drinking up the Spirits;</HI> that therefore Chri∣stians
may prepare in time, for the
dreadful Moments which are approaching;
that when the Call is heard, no other
Noise may drown their Comforts; and
that the Business of Life, may now with∣out
any delay be to prepare for Death,
I say, that they may be mov'd to do thus,
this Tract is written.</P>
<P>The Apprehensions we are under at
this time, of the approaching Calamity
which afflicts our Neighbours, are a
kind of Summons to this Preparation,
and that more forcible, than can be gi∣ven
from the Mouth of Man; and many
Thousands will have reason to be thank∣ful
for so long a Warning, so timely a
Summons; even all those who listen to
the Voice of it: Let me add a Mite to
this Treasury; The goodness of God is
very Conspicuous in this, that as a Pesti∣lence
sweeps whole Towns and Cities of
People away, and Death rages like an
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>
overflowing Stream, that there is little
or no time given for Repentance or cal∣ling
upon God; little time to look up
or to look in: So that Notice given of
its approach, ought to be taken for the
time of Interval, for both looking up and
looking in, and be improv'd to that Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Nay, so merciful is God to us, that
we really have more time usually given
us, in the Case of a Plague: I say, more
time than we have in most sorts of other
Distempers, and that time blest with
greater Advantages: This is so much a∣gainst
the Common Notions we have of
it, that it requires some Explanation,
but you will be more fully inform'd of
it, in a short Discourse which happend
between some Relations in a Family in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
just before the last great Plague.</P>
<P>The time before that dreadful Visita∣tion
was, <HI>as this is,</HI> a time of Apprehen∣sion
and Terror; Something like this
it is true, the Warnings were not so long
or the Danger so very remote: The Di∣stemper,
according to that Eminent Phy∣sician
Dr. <HI>Hodges,</HI> was brought to <HI>Holland</HI>
on Board a Ship, in some Bales of Goods
from the <HI>Levant:</HI> I think from <HI>Smyrna,</HI> as
this Contagion now raging in <HI>France,</HI> was
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>
said to be brought in Bales of Goods from
<HI>Zidon</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Cypras.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Holland</HI> it came over hither, how
it was brought over to us, or by who,
that was never particularly known, or at
least not publickly: The first that died
of it here, at least that was put into the
<HI>Bills</HI> openly, as dead of the Plague, was
in the Parish of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s in the <HI>Fields,</HI>
it was reported that the whole Family
died; and I have some reason to believe
they did too, but there was but one
Enter'd in the <HI>Weekly Bill,</HI> and this was
about <HI>December</HI> 1664.</P>
<P>This was Heaven's first Alarm to the
City of <HI>London,</HI> for it was remarkable that
the Infection begun in the Heart of the
Kingdom, as I may call it; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t did
not begin in a remote place, as has been
the Case in <HI>France,</HI> where it began at
<HI>Marseilles,</HI> above Four Hundred Miles off
of Paris, and so came on gradually; but
it first appeared in <HI>London</HI> it self, and <HI>as
I have said above,</HI> the first that was pub∣lickly
given in in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish, a∣bout
the 20th of <HI>December</HI> 1664; as
this Blow was near the Heart, so it
more nearly touch'd the People, and their
Apprehensions seem'd to be in Proportion
more serious and affecting.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="145"/>
Two Brothers and a Sister, the Chil∣dren
of one Pious and serious Mother, a
Widow, liv'd together in one House in
the City; they were all grown to Years
of Discretion, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sister (the Youngest)
being about Nineteen, and one of the
Brothers near Forty, the other about
Twenty Six Years of Age; the Sister
was a most Religious and well Instructed
Young Woman, knowing in all Religious
and Heavenly Knowledge; the Brothers
Men of Business engag'd in it and taken
much up with it; they had been all re∣ligiously
Educated, and were what we call
Sober and orderly People; but being Em∣barrass'd
in Business and hurry'd in the
World, getting Money and growing Rich,
they had not made the Concern of Eter∣nal
Life the chief Business of the pre∣sent
Life, as we all ought to do.</P>
<P>The two Gentlemen were Merchants,
had liv'd abroad, and being return'd to
<HI>England,</HI> were entred into great Engage∣ment
of Business, and had vast Concerns
on their Hands; were Partners, and had
two or three Servants and Book-Keepers
that were daily in the Counting-House,
and doing Business, as well at the Water∣side,
as at the <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI> with their
Masters.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="146"/>
As the Eledest of the two Brothers was
a Widower, and had but two Chil∣dren,
who were very small, and that the
youngest Brother was a Batchelor, the
young Lady their Sister was their House∣Keeper,
and they call'd her familiarly
their Governess, and such she was in∣deed
many ways; being not only the
Guide of their whole Family which was
large, but a faithful Monitor to them∣selves
also as occasion presented; tho' not
at first with all the Success that she
wish'd for: Their Heads and Hearts as
above, being wholly taken up with Busi∣ness
and the World.</P>
<P>The old Lady did not live in the
House with them, but having two or
three younger Children with her, liv'd
a little way out of Town, having also
two other Sons, young Gentlemen of about
Nineteen or Twenty Years of Age, who
were abroad in <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> and plac'd
in very good Business by the Directions
and on Account of their Brothers.</P>
<P>The good Mother of this Family ha∣ving
early Impressions of the Danger that
was impending, began to have a heavy
Heart, and be deeply concern'd on account
of her Sons; and having receiv'd early
Impressions as all the Town indeed had,
that a heavy and grievous Judgement
<PB N="136" REF="147"/>
was coming upon the City, and upon
the whole Nation; and as she came
frequently to Town to her Sons, which
was as it were her other Family, she
fail'd not on every Occasion to be
putting them in mind what a Stroke,
<HI>as she said,</HI> was coming upon the Na∣tion,
and upon the City in particular;
and to let them know what a dismal
time it would be with all <HI>those People es∣pecially,</HI>
whose eternal State was not se∣cur'd,
and who had not the Comfort of
a safe Passage out of Life in their View.</P>
<P>This she urg'd upon her Children every
time she came to see them, and particu∣larly
would be representing to them how
it was in <HI>London</HI> in the time of the great
Plague, as it was then call'd, which had
been 29 Years before, which I, <HI>says she,</HI>
very well remember, having liv'd here all
that while, and lost several Relations and
Acquaintances who died of the Infection,
at which time there died 10400 People
of the Plague in the City only; and
likewise in the Plague Eleven Years be∣fore
that, <HI>viz.</HI> in 1624, when there died
of all Distempers, above 54000 People in
<HI>London</HI> and the Out-Parishes, not reckon∣ing
the City of <HI>Westminster,</HI> or the Parishes
of <HI>Stepney, Hackney, Islington, Lambeth, Ro∣therhith</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="148"/>
or <HI>Christ Church,</HI> and <HI>Newington</HI> in
<HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>She talk'd so often of it, that her Eld∣est
Son us'd to tell her that she was a lit∣tle
too Possitive, that it look'd as if she
would be thought Prophetick; that the
Plague was not actually broken out be∣cause
one Man had dy'd of it; that he
believ'd it was always in one part or o∣ther
of the City a little; that the Plague in
1636, which she remember'd held 8 Years,
and that every Year there died more or
less, from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 to 3000, that there was
yet no Publication of it, and <HI>I hope,
Madam,</HI> says he, <HI>there will not;</HI> and there∣fore
that we shou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not be always al∣larming
one another, as if it was at the
Door; that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al mity was terrible
enough when it came; but that to be
always in a Fright about it, was to make
it a Judgment when it was no Judgment,
<HI>and the like;</HI> in a Word, like her Sister
Preachers, <HI>Mary Magdalen, &amp;c. her Words
seem'd to them as Idl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les,</HI> Luke 24. II.</P>
<P>However, like a true affectionate Mother
she continu'd her monitory Discourses to
them; you Sons, <HI>says she,</HI> are grown up,
and are above my Admonition as the
Mother, but you cannot be out of the
reach of Exhortation, and my speaking
to you, <HI>says she,</HI> is with so much regard
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>
to your Years, that you ought not how∣ever
to take it amiss that I press you to
prepare for the dreadful time of a Visita∣tion
if it should come.</P>
<P>No Madam, <HI>says the Eldest Son,</HI> none
of your Children will take it amiss, but
we think you make your Company, which
was always pleasant to us, be a little Me∣ancholly,
for that you are always upon

<P>It came suddenly it may be, with∣out
any Warning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, People had Warning
too; but we that were young People then,
<HI>just as you are now,</HI> we would take no No∣tice
of it; we were Marrying and giving
in Marriage to the very Day that it
came upon us; and when good People
spoke to us of Repenting, and preparing
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>
to meet the Lord in his Day of Wrath,
and humble ourselves under his mighty
Hand; we thought them just as you do
now, too Melancholly and Flegmatick;
that they did not do well to Alarm the
People, and put Families and Cities into
Frights and Disorders: And thus we
went on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well Madam,</HI> and yet for all that
it may be you thought as seriously of
it when it came as they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay Son, but they that had
thought seriously of it so long before us,
had a great advantage of us, and were so
much before us in their Preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They had so much more indeed
to answer for, if they were not better
prepar'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, <HI>Son,</HI> it should be ra∣ther
said, we had so much the more to
answer for if we were worse prepar'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Madam,</HI> What can we do in
the Case as it stands now? every one ought
to prepare for Death, whether there be
a Plague in the Town or no: Death
comes in a many other Shapes than
that of a pestilence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true Child, and I do
not speak against daily Preparations for
Death, <HI>God sorbid</HI> I should; but when an
Infection comes, Child, Death seems to
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>
come with more Terrors about him, cuts
down swifter, and we have less time to
think of what is to follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some reflect upon the Severity
of the Judgment upon that very Score,
in that People are swept away with a
Stroke, and have scarce time to look up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No Son,</HI> let none say so, for
I affirm, that God's Mercies are so in∣terspers'd
with his Judgments, that we
have abundant Cause to acknowledge
them, and ought to keep our Eye upon
it in this particular; namely, That God
always gives more time to People to
prepare for Death in the Case of a Plague
than of an ordinary Distemper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How Madam!</HI> That cannot be, for
in the Plague People often die in Twelve
Hours after they are taken, whereas in
Fevers and other Distempers, they gene∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly
lie as many Days or more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay Son, but then you do not
consider that the Plague generally ap∣proaches
a Country by slow Degrees,
and you have many Months Warning
of it before it comes; so that if it swept
all away in a Day, there is no room to
call it Severity, for every one had Warn∣ing
of it before Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But People do not look on the
Judgment as particular, till it touches
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>
them Personally, or that it Points to
them in a Family Capacity, that is to
say, till it has gotten into the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Folks do not take Warn∣ing,
is their Folly and Fault; but that
God gives them Warning is their Mer∣cy,
if they know how to make use of
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Body is willing to hope
they shall escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But every Body ought to
provide as if they were not to escape:
Every Soldier in the Army hopes to es∣cape
being Kill'd, but every Soldier puts
on his Head-piece that he may fare the
better if he is hit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We should prepare no doubt, but
to be apprehensive continually, as if we
were sure to have the Distemper, is even
to fright us into it: All Physicians a∣gree
that we should keep our Minds
Easy and Calm, that the Passion of Fear
and Anger prepare the Heart to receive
and nourish the Infection, at least to dis∣pirit
and debillitate it, so that it is not
duly Fortisy'd and Encourag'd to resist
the Approaching Enemy which it is to
struggle with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>You greatly mistake the thing,
Child, and mistake my meaning: I am of
the same Mind, and say as the Doctors
<PB N="142" REF="153"/>
do, though upon other Grounds; the
Mind should be kept calm and free,
that Nature might be assisted to repulse
the Enemy that Attacks her; but then
I say that nothing can Animate and En∣courage
the Mind, like a firm Resigna∣tion
to the Will of God, and a comforta∣ble
Hope that it shall be well with us
beyond Life; this is certainly the best
Preparation for the Distemper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not deny but we should be
always preparing for Death, but we should
not be discouraging our selves before it
comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call discourag∣ing
your selves, Preparation is the only
Way to avoid being discourag'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk of Preparation, as if I
was sure it would come upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as we have reason to
be satisfied that the Distemper is begun
and is among us, I think every one, <HI>speak∣ing
of his Preparations,</HI> should look upon
himself as if absolutely struck, as much
as if he saw the Tokens upon his Flesh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not that all Flegmatick
and Vapours, Madam? Do not many, <HI>do
ye think,</HI> in the Plague as they do in o∣ther
Distempers, fancy they have it, till
they really bring it, and so have it be∣cause
they fancied they should have it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="154"/>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>You forgot what I said, <HI>Son:</HI> I
said as to our Preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You distinguish nicely, <HI>Madam,</HI>
but others will take it another Way:
You say we should always look upon
our Case as if we really had the Distem∣per;
certainly that would be poreing too
much upon a Thing so dreadful! Why
it would make some People go distract∣ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I distinguish clearly, <HI>Son,</HI> tho'
not so nicely as you would have me: I
say, <HI>as to our Preparations,</HI> we should do
thus, that is to say, we ought to prepare
for Death, as if we had the Distemper
just now upon us, and my reason is good;
because I can assure you when the Body
is agitated with that Distemper, there
will be as little Capacity as there may
be time to look up to God and to pre∣pare
for Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Madam,</HI> you would have us
think our selves all dead Men, or as if
we were under a Sentence of Death, on∣ly
Repriev'd <HI>Sine die,</HI> a little while, and
to be Executed at the pleasure of the
Judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly our Case is no o∣ther
than that in the whole ordinary
Course of Life; but in this of the Plague
it is much more so, especially to such
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>
whose Business and Circumstances call
them to continue in the City on such
an Occasion, as you say <HI>Son,</HI> yours does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Madam,</HI> you have been in
<HI>London</HI> during two Plagues, that in 1625
and that in 1636, and you are still alive,
Why may not we fare as well now if it
should come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>The more I have of the Mer∣cy
of God to account for Child, but I
cannot say I was in the City all the while,
for the last Plague I was absent in <HI>Cheshire,</HI>
but the first indeed, I saw wonderful
Things and terrible to relate; and this
makes me say that we should all look
upon ourselves as dead Persons or as re∣priev'd
Criminals, and giving up ourselves
entirely into God's Hands, should stand
ready expecting to answer at the first Call,
and say, <HI>Come Lord Jesus;</HI> for take my
Word, <HI>Son,</HI> if it comes you'll say, 'tis a
time to tremble at, a time to be pre∣par'd
for, not a time to <HI>Prepare in.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Madam,</HI> it may please God to
Avert the Judgment, he may be better
to us than our Fears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it should be so no Man
would ever repent of his Preparations
if they were sincere, or say it was so
much lost; but flatter not yourself, <HI>Son,</HI>
with its not coming, it is not coming
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>
<HI>but come,</HI> Have you not seen it begun?
there are several dead of it already, and
more than you think of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There has one or two died in
St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish indeed, but it was last
<HI>December,</HI> and we are now in <HI>March,</HI>
and there has been but one more, so that
I hope 'tis over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That hoping 'tis over, is a Snare
of the Devil; flatter not your self with
it when the Plague begins, tho' there be
but one or two that die at first, you ne∣ver
hear it goes off so, it always goes on
tho' it begins slowly; and that slowness
of its begining, is what I call the merciful
Warning given to us all, of the Approach
of the Judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that when one or two die, you
would have us take it that the Plague
is begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do insist upon it, and
that it always goes on; <HI>but farther,</HI> let
me tell you, I know very well, that
when our <HI>Weekly Bills</HI> set down one or two
to die of the Plague, you may depend
upon there being more, for People are
always diligent to conceal their Families
being Infected, because they would not
have their Shops forsaken, their Houses
shut up, or themselves be shun'd as be∣longing
to infected Families; and there∣fore
<PB N="146" REF="157"/>
in the last Plague of 1636. I remem∣ber
there was so much Fraud used by
the Parish Clarks, in forming the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ekly
Bills,</HI> that it was certain there died 200
a Week of the Plague, when by the <HI>Bills</HI>
there was only 10, 12 or 15, or therea∣bouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you look on the Plague
as a thing already begun among us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Child,</HI> I do! and I be∣lieve
firmly that it is so at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you have us
do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>My answers, <HI>Son,</HI> are short to
that Question, whether you mean by US,
us of this Family, or US of the Nation:
I would have us return to God, lie at
his Feet▪ take the Words of the Scripture,
and say,—<HI>Thou hast smitten, and thou
wilt bind us up,</HI> Hos. 6. 1. In a Word, I
would have every one prepare themselves
for Death, prepare together, and prepare
apart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>As much as if they were on their
Death Beds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay indeed, the very same; and
be Thankful, <HI>humbly Thankful</HI> for the time
allow'd for it; Thankful that God had
in Mercy spa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our with a
reserve of Health and Strength, to turn
to him and Repent; for then be assured
<PB N="147" REF="158"/>
when the Visitation begins, there will be
no room for it, all will be fill'd with
Horror and Desolation, every one mourn∣ing
for himself; no Composure, no Com∣passion,
no Affection; none to Comfort,
none to Assist; nothing but Death in all
its most dismal Shapes, and in its most
frightful Appearances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Madam,</HI> if your Rule was
to be observ'd there should be an imme∣diate
Cessation of all Business, from the
King upon the Throne, to the School-Boy
to the Beggar in the Street; all
should fall on their Knees together, like
the People of <HI>Nineveth?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that such a Sight was to be
seen! I am so fully perswaded that the
Plague that is coming, and that I say is
now begun among us, is a Messenger sent
from God, to Scourge us from our crying
Sins, that if the Cry of this Nation was
as Universally sent up to Heaven, as
was that of the Citizens of <HI>Nineveth,</HI>
and with the same sincerity of Humilia∣tion;
I say, I firmly believe, that as was
then the Case, God would <HI>repent him of
his fierce Anger, that me Perish not.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will not see that here
<HI>Madam?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Child I doubt not,</HI> and there∣fore
I am not talking of National Humilia∣tions,
<PB N="148" REF="159"/>
but of Family and Personal Hu∣miliations
and Repentance, and that,
not on expectation that God should
withdraw the Judgment from the Coun∣try
wherein we live, but that he would
withold his Hand, and the Hand of his
destroying Angel from our Houses, and
our Families, and our Persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Madam,</HI> you would put us
all into Confusion, you would Fright and
Terrify us so, that we must shut up our
Shops, Embargo our Ships, close our
Ports; the Custom House would have
no Business, the Exchange no Merchants,
the Merchandize no Market?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say again, O that I could see
such a Sight in <HI>London:</HI> It is true, it wou'd
be as you describ'd it; and indeed it
ought to be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>God sorbid, <HI>Madam,</HI> Why we shou'd
be all frighted out of our Wits?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I wish I cou'd see
them so out of their Wits as that comes
to; I should expect that then some Mi∣racle
of Deliverance would follow, as was
the Case of <HI>Nineveth,</HI> but it is not to
be expected here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, <HI>Madam,</HI> I believe not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, there is not a Spirit
of National Humiliation among us; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
see National Sins rather, come up to such
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>
height as they never were at in this Nati∣on
before; the Dreg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the late Wars are
not purg'd out, and will not be purg'd out
but by Fire; that is to say, by the Fire
of God's Judgment, which is already be∣gun
among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they have been as bad for∣merly,
<HI>Madam?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have been as bad for∣merly,
in the revelling Days of King—but
never worse than now;
and this even under the pretence of greater
Reformation; all manner of Wickedness
and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blick Debauchery being let loose
among us, and breaking in upon us like
a Flood, encourag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d even by those who
ought to suppress them; and by the Ex∣ample
of those from whom we hoped to
find Examples of good, and at least to
have Prophaneness and Immoralities pu∣nished
and discourag'd by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The World was always as wicked,
I think, as 'tis now, <HI>Madam,</HI> since I re∣member
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we hoped this late turn
of Times should have given a Blow to
the Wickedness of the Times and I think
it has rather made them worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That lies upon the great Men,
<HI>Madam,</HI> who should have reform'd us,
and who should have shew'd better Ex∣amples
<PB N="150" REF="161"/>
to the People; and you see they
have appointed Days of Humiliation for
us: What can they do more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and God may visit our
Magistrates as well as others; but cer∣tainly
this Judgment will fall upon the
People too; for tho' the other are Princi∣pal,
the People are guilty, and 'tis from
them that God expects a general Re∣pentance;
and therefore National Humi∣liations
are the Duty of the People on
these Occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see nothing in those publick
Humiliations but Formality, and making
a kind of Holiday of it; a Day of Idle∣ness
and Sloth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that I hope among se∣rious
People it is otherwise, but in the
general it is too true; and therefore
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no farther into a Complaint of
what we cannot mend, this, however,
we can do; every one can reform for
themselves, and repent for themselves;
and this is what I would fain see in
our Families, every one mourning apart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But even that is not likely to be
seen in the Manner you would have it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Son,</HI> and therefore I am for
having every Body prepare for the Plague,
by preparing for Death, as seriously and
with as much Application, as if they
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>
were actually. Infected, and had the Di∣stemper
upon them</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Preparations for Death, <HI>Madam.</HI>
What do you call Preparations for Death?
In the first place, if I am to prepare for
Death, I must make my Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Child, do not make a
Jest of it; I am speaking with a Heart
full of Grief, upon a Subject, which when
it comes, will perhaps be as terrifying to
you as to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and more too, <HI>Madam,</HI> I am
not jesting with it I assure you; but
I would hope it may not come, it may
please God to prevent it; and therefore
I cannot think of such a Solemn entring
upon Preparations for dying, as if it was
this Minute upon me; for then, as I said,
I must make my Will, shut up my Coun∣ting-House,
stop all my Shipping of
Goods, and selling of Goods, put off my
Servants, and send for the Minister, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>This <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do really call jesting
with it, <HI>Son,</HI> but since you will speak of
these Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tell you, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> every
Man that has any Family Affairs to settle,
ought to do it forth with; for a time of
the Plague will be no time for making of
Wills and settling Estates, I assure you, any
more than it will be for Repentance,
when Ministers will not be found to Com∣fort
<PB N="152" REF="163"/>
the Souls of dying Penitents; it may
be found still harder to find Seriveners
to make their Wills: When Flus bands are
abandon'd of their Wives▪ and Wives of
their Husbands, Fathers of their Children,
and Children of their Fathers and Mo∣thers;
when every one flies from another
for fear of their own Lives, there will be
no room for fettling Affairs, as you call it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Madam,</HI> you make ones Blood
run chill in the Veins to hear you talk
so; come, pray let us talk of somewhat
else, this is enough to make one die with
the fear of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Child, 'tis much worse to
die in that Condition it self, than with
the fear of it: I could tell you such Sto∣ries
of the several dreadful Circumstances
of Families and single Persons, in the seve∣ral
times of such Judgments as these, which
have happened in my time, and which I have
particularly heard, as would make your
Blood run chill in your Veins indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>O Madam,</HI> don't tell us such dis∣mal
Stories, you should rather encou∣rage
us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would say any thing to en∣courage
you to go about the Preparati∣ons
that I speak of; but I doubt that is
not the encouragement you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="153" REF="164"/>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Madam,</HI> that is not the
Encouragement my <HI>Brother</HI> means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>Brother</HI> thinks you shou'd
rather encourage us to hope it will not
come, or that if it should come, we may
escape it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can the end of such
Encouragement be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that we should not be al∣ways
poreing upon it, but might live as
chearfully as we us'd to do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>Mother</HI> seems to inti∣mate,
that to encourage us so, can have
nothing in it but to encourage us to
continue unprepar'd for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we are all prepar'd for
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can answer but for one; I
dare not say I am prepar'd, unless it be
to die at the very Thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, why that's the very Thing
I say, my <HI>Mother</HI>'s enough to fright us all
to Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as my <HI>Daughter</HI> said,
what can I do to encourage you? <HI>as you
call it,</HI> is to encourage you to put off
all Preparations: Is it possible for me to
do that? No, but I would encourage you
to be prepar'd, that wou'd be to destroy
all the reason of Fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you see my <HI>Sister</HI> says <HI>Madam,</HI>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think that to move

from the Case; and in the present
Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cle, of the Plague breaking out in a
City or Town where we live, I think 'tis
<PB N="155" REF="166"/>
much more to the Purpose; and to bid us
prepare, I think, is not justly to be call'd
frighting us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son</SPEAKER>
<P>It is alarming us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but <HI>Son,</HI> it is not alarm∣ing
us when we ought not to be alarm'd,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Madam,</HI> I will not oppose your
Cautions, I know you mean well; but
you will give us leave to hope, that it
may not be so bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Brother,</HI> I do not find
that my <HI>Mother</HI> insists on what will, or

is real, she moves us to be ready for
the worst.</P>

infected with it.</P>

<P>Why now, <HI>Madam;</HI> did I not say
this was frighting People to Death; you

not frighted at the Thoughts of the Di∣stemper,
but only at your not being

<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then because I am sensible

I had the Tokens come out upon me.</P>

<P>Did not my <HI>Mother</HI> tell us we

<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> I am afraid

tho' 'tis frightful to be told so feeling∣ly

it as actually begun; yet I cannot say
but 'tis very necessary we should be
so frighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Sister,</HI> then I have done you
no harm in frighting you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, you have done me no

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that the whole Nation were
so frighted into the same Resolution;
God assist you, my Dear, and cause you
to go on comfortably in such a Work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You bring it to a more solemn
Extreme than I intended it, Madam: I
wish every one may prepare for it, but
I cannot say I would have them frighted
into their Preparations, that was all I
meant; and the Reason is, because such
publick alarming the People has in it
publick Mischiefs, it does hurt to the
Nation in general, injures Trade, wounds
the Poor, sets other Nations upon their
Guard with us, as if we were already In∣fected;
sinks Credit and discourages the
People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to do with your
Politicks, all your Reasons of State are of
no Weight here; it were better all those
mischiefs follow'd, and the People were
prevail'd upon to begin a general sincere
Repentance, than that all those Things
should be avoided, and the poor stupid
People be left to Sleep in Security, till
they sink into Destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="158" REF="169"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Madam,</HI> that is true too,
but these things may be done prudent∣ly
too, and with respect to the publick
Peace; for all such Alarms as disturb
Peoples Minds with the Fears of publick
Calamities, send to Confusion, and to
putting us all in an Uproar; as <HI>Jonah</HI>'s
preaching to the Men of <HI>Nineveth,</HI> that
they should be destroy'd in 40 Days, it
put all the City into a Combustion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that Combustion was
the saving the whole City from Destruc∣tion:
Pray Brother, where was the In∣jury
done them, they believ'd the Threat∣ning
and Repented?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, what with the Mother
and the Daughter, you're sure to carry
the Point: I do not see the Case is pa∣rallel
at all; you do not Prophesy that
<HI>London</HI> shall be destroy'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Case differs indeed Bro∣ther,
for let what will be said here, that
the Plague is begun, we do not see that
the People believe it, or incline to pre∣pare
for it; you see how far you are
from believing it your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>Son,</HI> to put an end to all
the frivolous Pleadings about frighting
and alarming the People: I say, that to
perswade People to Preparations for Death
because such a Judgment is likely to
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>
come upon them, is not alarming or
frighting them at all; a serious perswad∣ing
Men to Repent and Prepare, is per∣swading
them to put themselves into such
a Posture, as that they may not be fright∣ed
or surpriz'd or alarm'd, for to be pre∣pared,
is to be past being frighted, and
to be in the only Condition that gives
Courage: You may as well say, <HI>John</HI> the
<HI>Baptist</HI> frighted the People, when he prea∣ched
to them, and cried, <HI>Repent for the
Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we must come, <HI>Madam,</HI> to
inquire what you mean by Preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I may speak before my
Mother, I'll tell you Brother, what I be∣lieve
my Mother means, or at least how
I understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not but you both un∣derstand
it, and understand it alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand by Preparations
for Death, Repentance and a reform'd
Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are the general indeed,
Child, there may be many particulars
in them, but I am no Preacher, take it
there, the rest will follow of Course; Re∣pent
and Reform, those two will contain
all the Preparations you can want or I
desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Body can Object, that we
ought not to Repent and Reform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Child,</HI> I only press to
the present going about it, because the
Judgments of God are at Hand, and you
complain that this is frighting People, in
which I think you are mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Madam,</HI> if you mean no o∣therwise,
I join with you with all my
Heart, certainly we should be perswaded
by all just and reasonable Argument to
Repentance and Reformation: I did not
deny that, I only said I hope, the Plague
may not be so near as you fear it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Son,</HI> we will not differ
about that; if it pleases God to spare
us, and to spare the Land in which we
live, I shall be one of the first to rejoice
and give thanks; and tho' I dare not
say, I expect it, I shall not cease to pray for
it, still carrying this along with me in all
I have to say of it, That to Repent and
Reform our Lives and turn with all our
Hearts to the Lord, which is what I mean
by Preparations, is the only way to be
unsurpriz'd at it when it comes upon us:
A Mind suitably prepar'd, is a Mind for∣tify'd
and made bold to meet the Worst;
prepar'd to give up its self into the Hands
of a merciful Saviour; a Heart prepar'd,
is the Heart the Scripture speaks of, when
<PB N="161" REF="172"/>
it says, <HI>He shall not be afraid of Evil
Tid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs, whose Heart is fixed, trusting in the
Lord,</HI> Psalm 1127.</P>
<P>Thus this Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erence between Mother
and Son ended for that time; it was now
about the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1665, and there
had died but one of the Plague since <HI>De∣cember,</HI>
and that was in the beginning
of <HI>February;</HI> so that the Eldest Brother
us'd frequently to laugh at his Sister a∣bout
the long Dialogue they had held with
their Mother, on the Subject of the Plague
coming upon them and how it was ac∣tually
begun; and once or twice Jested
with her a little Prophanely, as she thought,
about her Preparations, as she call'd them,
for the Plague.</P>
<P>This griev'd the Young Lady, and
made her shed Tears several Times; and
once she took the Freedom to say, Dear
Brother, you Jest at my Preparations with
too much Reason, they being but very
weak and imperfect; I pray God I may
be able to prepare my self better against
such a dreadful time, if ever it should
come; but I beseech you Brother, to take
care that your own Preparation be not a
Jest indeed, when such a Time comes; and if
it should be so, how you will be able to stand
it, for certainly nothing but a Mind well
prepar'd, can be able to bear up; How
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>
shall our Hearts endure, or our Hands
be strong in such a Day as that?</P>
<P>It was in the very anguish of her Mind
that she said this to her Brother, and
not with any Passion or Displeasure at
his ill using her; but she did it with such
Seriousness, such Gravity, and so many
Tears, that he was very much affected
with it, ask'd her Pardon, told her he
would not jest with her any more upon
that Subject, that he was satisfy'd she was
much better prepar'd than he was, and
that she was in the Right; that he would
for the future do all that lay in his
Power to encourage her Preparations; that
tho' he had not receiv'd such Impressions
himself from his Mother's Discourse, as
she had, yet, he was far from thinking
her in the Wrong; and that should such
a time come, as their Mother had talk'd
of, he could not deny but she was much
better prepar'd to stand it than he was,
but that his dependance was that God
would spare them, and not bring such a
Calamity upon them.</P>
<P>This heal'd that little Wound his loose
way of talking had made, and his Sister
was pacify'd; she told him, she was glad
to find him more serious on a Subject so
Weighty; that as to the Freedom he
took with her, that was nothing; but that
<PB N="163" REF="174"/>
it griev'd her so, that she cou'd not bear
it, to hear him speak slightingly of the
most dreadful Judgments of God, that
were at that time abroad in the Earth;
that as she was entirely of her Mother's
Opinion, that it would not be long be∣fore
it broke out here, <HI>however, he might
censure▪ and perhaps ridicule that thought as
Melancholly and Vapourish,</HI> and that, <HI>as she
said,</HI> she was fully possess'd with a Belief
of it, so it cou'd not but very sorely afflict
her for his sake, to think how light he
made of it: And that her Satisfaction was
as great, in proportion, to see him abate
of the Levity with which he had talk'd
of those Things.</P>
<P>It was not above a Fortnight after
this Discourse, but the Town h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ano∣ther
Alarm, and her Brother was the Per∣son
that brought her home the News of
it; for about the 20th of <HI>April,</HI> the
News was spread all over the Town,
that the Plague was broke out again in
St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish, and that there was a
whole Family dead of it.</P>
<P>The young Lady was in her Chamber
one Morning, when her Brother, having
been out about his Affairs, came home
in a very great Concern, and coming
up to her Door, <HI>O Sister,</HI> says he, <HI>we
are all undone.</HI> Undone! says his Sister,
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>
<HI>what's the Matter;</HI> he cou'd not speak a∣gain
for a good while; but as his Sister
was frighted, and press'd him again, with
repeating the Words, <HI>what's the Matter?</HI>
at last he cries out again, <HI>We are all un∣done,</HI>
Sister! <HI>my Mother and you were both
in the right,</HI> the PLAGUE is BEGUN!</P>
<P>He appear'd in the greatest Consterna∣tion
imaginable, and his Sister had much
to do to keep him from Swooning; his
Heart, as he said afterwards was sunk
within him, his Thoughts all in Con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣sion,
and the Affairs both of Body and
Soul, lay heavy upon him (for as I said
above, he was a Merchant, and engag'd
in a vast Business). His Sister receiv'd
the News without any fright or surprize,
but with a calm Mind, stood still a while,
and as it were musing to bring her Mind
to a settl'd Frame, while her Brother
went on with his Exclamations, at
length lifting up her Eyes and Hands,
<HI>'Tis the Lord,</HI> cries she, <HI>let him do what
seemeth Good in his Sight;</HI> and immediate∣ly
apply'd herself to relieve her Brother,
and get something for him to take, to re∣store
his Spirits, Comforting him with
her Words, as well as Actions.</P>
<P>He was not so overwhelm'd, but that
he cou'd perceive the surprizing Manner
with which his Sister, <HI>tho' so young,</HI> receiv'd
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>
the News; and how free from any Op∣pressions
or sinking of her Spirits; how
it did not discompose her, so as to hinder
her Concern for him, and when he came
a little to himself, he said aloud, O
Sister! you are happy, that took the
early Counsel of our <HI>Dear Mother;</HI> with
what a different Courage does a pre∣par'd
mind receive the Impressions of the
most dreadful Things, from one that be∣ing
Careless and Negligent in these Things
as I have been, entertains the first
Thoughts about them, not till they are
just upon him?</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> says she, do not talk so
of me; my Preparations are poor, empty
Things, I have no Preparations but these
few, an imperfect Repentance, and an
humble Resolution to cast my self upon
infinite Mercy; and I hope, you have
gone beyond me in all these, for you have
more Knowledge, more Years, more Ex∣perience
and more Faith too than I have,
or else it is but very weak.</P>
<P>You are happy, <HI>Child,</HI> let the Judg∣ment
come when it will, says her Bro∣ther,
but I have all my Work to do; I
have had more Years and more Know∣ledge
you say; and I must add, that I
have more Work to do, more Talents to
account for, more mispent time to answer
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>
for, and I have made no Preparation for
this surprizing Condition we are all like
to be in, you know I despis'd it all.</P>
<P>She had besides this Discourse, inquir'd
of him, how Things were, and how he
understood that, as he call'd it, <HI>the Plague
was begun:</HI> He gave her an account that
there had been two Men buried in St.
<HI>Giles</HI> in the <HI>Fields;</HI> that it was true there
was but two put in the <HI>Weekly Bill;</HI> but
that he was assur'd there were two or three
Houses Infected, and that five People were
dead in one, and seven in another; and
that the Number of Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s
Parish, which used to be about 16 or 18
at most, was now Increased to 30, which
intimated strongly that the Increase was
by the Plague, tho' they conceal'd it, and
put them in of other Distempers.</P>
<P>This was a terrifying Account, and he
was exceedingly Affected with it himself,
as you see; as for the young Lady his
Sister, who had long us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d herself to the
Thoughts of these Things; who expected
it to be as it happen'd, and who from
her Mother's Discourse, having for some
Months look'd upon the Distemper as
begun, had seriously apply<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d herself to the
great Work of <HI>Preparation for Death,</HI> and
was come to that happy State of being
entirely resign'd to the Disposal of Heaven;
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>
this being her Case, I say, she was far less
surpriz'd with it than her Brother, and
stood as it were, ready to submit to the
Will of God, in whatever way it should
please him to deal with her; and thus she
abundantly made good the Principle her Mo∣ther
argued upon, <HI>viz.</HI> that to speak of the
Plague before hand as in View, and make
Preparations for it as a thing certain, was
so far from being a needless allarm to the
People and frighting and terrifying them,
that it was the only way to preserve them
from being frighted and terrify'd at it,
when it really came upon them; and was
the only way to keep the publick Peace▪ as
he called it, by keeping the People compo∣sed,
and free from the Confusions and tu∣multuous
Hurries which they are other∣wise
apt to fall into on such Occasions.</P>
<P>But the Scene was not as it were yet
spread, or the Tragedy begun; there was a∣nother
Prelude to appear, even in the nar∣row
compass of this one Family; O may
it not be the Case of many among us, upon
the present View of Things of the like
kind.</P>
<P>When the first Disorders of this Thing
were a little abated, and this Gentleman
come a little more to himself, Things
took a new turn with him; he was ne∣cessarily
embarrass'd in his Business in the
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>
Day, and in Company in the Evening;
but in the Morning had always a little
Conversation with his Sister; and she soon
observed that after the first two or three
Days, in which he continued much af∣fected
with the Danger they were all in,
and his own unprepar'd Condition also,
as he own'd it to be; I say, after this
she observ'd that he dropt the Discourse
by little and little; till at last he said no∣thing
at all of it to her for three or four
Days; upon this, one Morning as they
were talking together, she broke in upon
him with it thus: Dear Brother, says she,
you tell me no News now, nor how
we stand as to this terrible Stroke that
is coming upon us; I cannot but be very
much concern'd to hear what Condition
we are in, Pray how does it go on?</P>
<P>God be praised, says he, the Distemper
is stop'd again; they say, it was only a
violent Fever seized one or two Families,
and that the People have been in such a
fright about it, by the rashness of some
Old Women that set up a Cry of the
Plague, that it has put all the Town in
an uproar, but 'tis stop'd; and I saw the
Weekly Bill to Day, the Number of
Burials in St. <HI>Giles</HI> are Decreased again,
and none of the Plague, or Fever, more
than usual.</P>

<P><HI>No, Brother,</HI> it is not, because
I do not trouble any body with my talk;
I should not have said thus much to
you, but that you extort it, these are
Notices to my self only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I would have you be en∣courag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,
and have you encourage us all,
<HI>you are our</HI> GOVERNESS, and when you are
Dull and Melancholly all the Family will
be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not Dull and Melancholly,
but sure, <HI>Brother,</HI> this is not a Time to
be thoughtless, no body can be so that
has any common Sense; you was allarm'd
enough your self, but a Week ago, I do
not think you have lost those just im∣pressions
it made upon you then; tho'
you are not willing they should be seen
so plain as they were then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was all without Reason, I
think verily: I see 'tis all nothing but
the fright of Old Women, and of foolish
People, worse than Old Women, that
raised the Tumult all over the City.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Brother,</HI> if it prove so it
will be well; but I am sorry to see you
cool so fast upon it, before you are sure
the Danger is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Child,</HI> the Danger cannot be
said to be over, because it was never a
real Danger: As an Alarm and Fright, it
never had a foundation, but in the ima∣gination
of a few foolish People, I say,
who have so long talk'd the Town into
Expectation of the Plague, that, like
Wild-fire, they take at the first touch
and away they run Head-long with a
Story, as if they would have it be so;
for Fright and Wishes equally impose
upon People, and make us believe any
thing; when we either desire to have a
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>
thing, or are terribly afraid of it, we
believe it at first word; nay, we believe
the very rumour of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you are not sure, <HI>Brother,</HI>
that you have been imposed upon in this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Very sure, very sure;</HI> I am
satisfy'd 'tis all a Rumour, a mere Noise,
and there is nothing at all in it, but
what I tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not know it of your
own Knowledge, <HI>Brother.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not been up there in∣deed,
but if you will, I'll go to the very
Houses, and inquire into all the Parti∣culars,
tho' I think I am very well in∣form'd
how it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means <HI>Brother,</HI> I would
not have you go for a Thousand Pound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think there is any Dan∣ger
in it at all; I would not value going
there a Farthing; the People that were
sick are in their Graves, or well again,
and all is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Brother,</HI> I can say nothing
to it, you know those things better than
I; however, as you have no Occasion to
go thither, don't talk of that I ent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no Occasion indeed,
for I am satisfy'd of the thing, and so
is the whole City in general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, God fit us for all his
Will, and grant we may be prepar'd
to meet him with a due Submission in
all his Providences of what kind soever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mighty solemn, <HI>Child,</HI>
about it, 'tis strange you cannot be sa∣tis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd
as other People are; Why your
Fright might be over by this time one
would think, why 'tis almost a fortnight
ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> I hope I should not
be frighted if it were already come, but
I desire to be seriously looking up to
Heaven for needful Courage against the
time, for I am fully perswaded it is not
far off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I see you won't be bea∣ten
off of it, you will be Prophetick;
but if it were to be so, <HI>Child,</HI> we cannot
put it off; to what purpose should we
anticipate our Sorrow, and be mourning
about it, whether it comes or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>O Brother,</HI> let us remember my
<HI>Mother</HI>'s Words; when it is upon us, it
will be no time to make our Prepara∣tions,
then the Weight will be too heavy,
the Warning too short; the Plague is not
a thing that gives Warning then, or
that gives time for Repentance: Now
is the time for Preparation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="174" REF="185"/>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope my Dear, you are tho∣roughly
prepar'd for it, and therefore do
not be dejected, do not be so Melanchol∣ly:
I tell you, <HI>Child,</HI> you must encourage
us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, <HI>Brother,</HI> I dare not say
I am prepar'd, and therefore I have
cause to be Melancholly, as you call it;
I have done nothing, and can do nothing
but fly to the Arms of Mercy; Alas!
my Preparations are poor mean Things,
you are better prepar'd than I to be sure,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here, as he acknowledg'd afterward, he was struck with some terrible Reflections, and be stood mute for sometime, when his Sister, who perceiv'd it, went on again.</NOTE> <HI>Brother,</HI> or else you cou'd not have so

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a good thing, <HI>Brother,</HI> to have
so much Temper in a Case of this Con∣sequence,
as you have, I wish I had more
Courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we will talk of that ano∣ther

<P>Well, said he to himself, this poor
Child has more Religion, ay, and more
Wisdom too than all of us: In short, she
is seriously preparing for the Visitation
<PB N="175" REF="186"/>
if it should come; and while I reproach
her with being frighted, 'tis evident I
was more frighted than she was, when
the Alarm of its being broke out last
Week at St <HI>Giles</HI>'s run among us;
and should it really come upon us, I
know not what to say, her Words are
very true, 'twill be no time for Preparation
then.</P>
<P>The same Day in the Evening, being
in his Counting House with his <HI>Brother,</HI>
he began to talk a little with him about
it: <HI>Brother,</HI> says he, I cannot help having
some dull Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughts in my Head some∣times
about this talk that is so publick,
that we are like to have the Plague a∣mong
us this Summer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some dull Thoughts do you
call it! I assure you I am almost distracted
about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would put our Business all
into Confusion if it should come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into Confusion, do you say,
nay, 'twould ruin us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I hope twould not ruin
us neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would ruin me, I am sure,
my very Heart sinks within me when I
speak of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean? why you
are worse than our Governess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She! poor Child, she is in the
best Case of us all, she is safe, come or
not come; I wish I were in her Condi∣tion,
then I could have Courage enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean as to the Religious
part, I suppose, indeed she is a serious
dear Child; I have had a long Discourse
about it with her, she talks like an
Angel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has been preparing for
this Calamity a great while, she's happy;
but who can say they have done as she
has done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hark'e, you talk as she
does in one part, why you talk as if
you was sure we should have it among
us; I hope the Danger is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Over! How can you talk so,
I wonder you can be so secure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what have you heard
about it to Day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I have heard nothing
to Day; but you know how it is, as well
as I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know there was none in the
last Weeks <HI>Bill</HI> of the Plague; and I am
told there will be none in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the <HI>Bills,</HI> I wonder you
should lay any Stress upon what they
say; you know well enough they are
managed not to put them in openly of
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
the Plague, private People get their Dead
put in of other Distempers, that their
Houses may not be mark'd or order'd
to be shut up; they bride the Searchers
and Parish Officers, and on the other
Hand, the Publick themselves are not
willing to have the Town alarm'd; it
would make a terrible Alarm all over
the World you know; the Ships will be
deny'd PRODUCT all over the World,
and it will ruin Trade at Home and
Abroad; but alas, that's a Trifle to what
I talk of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you talk as if it was
not over indeed, is it really your opini∣on
then that it is not over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Opinion! ay and every
Bodies Opinion too besides mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why by your Discourse it
is really begun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Depend upon it, 'tis more
than begun, 'tis spread every way into
several Streets in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s; and they
will not be able to conceal it long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are enough to put the
whole Town in a fright, <HI>Brother;</HI> why
you are as bad as my <HI>Sister</HI> the Gover∣ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would I was as good as my
<HI>Sister;</HI> But what do you mean by being
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>
as bad as she is? she is frighted at it
then, I suppose, as I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly I don't know
whether she is or no; for when I came
about a fortnight ago, and told her the
Plague was begun, as you know we all
heard it was, she receiv'd the News with
such a composure of Mind, as I confess
I wonder'd at, and after a considerable
time of silence, answer'd only that it was
the Hand of God and he ought to do as
pleases him with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was like her indeed;
but don't say I am like her, I do not
pretend to it, I assure you; I am all
Horror and Confusion at the Thoughts
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say you are like her
so, indeed I don't know it, but you are
like her in this, she is for Alarming every
Body, as if the Plague was actually a∣mong
us, when she knows nothing of it,
and so are you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but hark'e, <HI>Brother,</HI> have
a care of being in a worse Extreme; for
you seem to be for Iulling your self a∣sleep,
when you know the Flame is kind∣led.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do I know 'tis kindled? don't
say so, I hope it is not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="179" REF="190"/>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot seriously say, you
hope it is not; you may say as I do,
that you wish it were not, but you cannot
but know it is actually begun, ay, and
more than begun, it is spread a great
way already, and in a very few Weeks
will be all over the City.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make my Blood run
chill in my Veins; what do you mean?
I cannot say I know it, I was really of
the Opinion that it was stopp'd again,
and that the Danger was over, at least
for the present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so your first Apprehensi∣ons
cool'd again I perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That 'twas too much my Case
I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was mine too after the
first Appearance of it at <HI>Christmas</HI> last;
I have been just like a Sick - Bed Peni∣tent,
as soon as the fear was over, the
Penitence cool'd and abated; but I feel
the Return with a double Reproach up∣on
me; I think it will sink me, before
the Distemper comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but do not be so pos∣sitive,
I hope you are not so sure of the
bad News, as you make your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> Why you and
I know how these Things are abroad,
don't you know how the Plague at
<PB N="180" REF="191"/>
<HI>Messina</HI> came creeping on just when we
left the City, and went away again two
or three times, but as soon as the <HI>Sun</HI>
advanc'd and they got into <HI>May,</HI> it broke
out like a Fire that had been smother'd
with hot Ashes; and what Havock it made,
and the like at <HI>Gallipoly,</HI> and on the <HI>Ca∣labrian</HI>
Coast; depend upon it the Distem∣per
is only smother'd with these <HI>Northerly</HI>
Winds, so that it creeps slowly on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but
as soon as the Winds come <HI>Westerly,</HI> and
the Weather is a little close and warm,
you will see dreadful Work here: I do not
speak to Alarm you, but we should not
be blind to our own Danger.</P>
<P>This Discourse ended here for the pre∣sent,
but the very next Day, which was
about the third or fourth of <HI>May,</HI> the
youngest <HI>Brother</HI> having been out in the
Morning, and coming into the Count∣ing
House, where his <HI>Brother</HI> was, want∣ing
very much to give vent to his
Thoughts, he desir'd one of their Servants
who was there to withdraw, and shutting
the Door after him, his <HI>Brother</HI> was just
going to open the Door again to go out
too, but he said, don't go our, <HI>Brother,</HI> I
want to speak with you; so his <HI>Brother</HI>
sat down, and seeing him look a little
<PB N="181" REF="192"/>
disorder'd, he said, what's the Matter
<HI>Brother,</HI> have you heard any bad News?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, bad News enough, I
assure you, we are all undone at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, what do you hear
any more of the Plague?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any more of it! why 'tis come
into the City, here's one dead in the
next Street to us almost, tis but in
<HI>Bear-binder-Lane.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of the Plague it self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay indeed, my <HI>Lord Mayor</HI>
sent two <HI>Surgeons</HI> to search the Body,
and they have both given it in, that he
died of the Plague; he was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI>
I told you how it would be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but this may be some
straggling loose Fellow, that has come
down from St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s for fear of it be∣cause
it was there about a fortnight ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't let us flatter ourselves
any longer, <HI>Brother,</HI> or trifle with Heaven,
it is spread at the other end of the
Town into the <HI>Strand,</HI> and from thence
into <HI>Holbourn:</HI> You shall see in two or
three Weeks more what dreadful Work
it will make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What shall we do, <HI>Brother,</HI>
what will become of us all, and what
will become of the Business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="182" REF="193"/>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, what will become of
our Souls? I am undone if I stay here,
I'll go over to <HI>France.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, it is too late for that,
<HI>Brother;</HI> before you can get thither, their
Ports will be all lock'd up; they won't
let a Vessel from <HI>England</HI> come near them,
you may be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure its too late for some∣thing
else, I have mock<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d God with that

<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are enough to terrify one

before we talk thus</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Brother,</HI> you do by the Dan∣ger
as I have done by my Preparations,
put it off as long as you can; you talk
of seeing about us, why you will see in
a very few Days the Plague be about us,
and no room to escape from it: I war∣rant
you will see People preparing to get
out of this dreadful City, as fast as they
can, if you go but as far as the <HI>Exchange;</HI>
and all Trade in a kind of Stagnation,
and it is time indeed it should be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see that we can go
out of it, at least not I; unless I will give
up all our Business, and leave every thing
to be ruin'd, and be a Booty to the next
Comer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure if I stay here, I shall
look on my self as a dead Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, <HI>Brother,</HI> all do not
Perish in the worst Plague, though the
Plague were to come, sure it will leave
some of us behind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have no room to expect
that I should be kept.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? I hope you will,
do not be frighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>O I have mock'd God, I say,
with my former Preparations; when I
was justly alarmed, I pretended Repen∣tance
and Reformation; but when the
fright was over, and we flatter'd our
selves, that the destroying Angel was
pass'd over, I cool'd and abated in my
Warmth, and became the same loose
wicked Fellow I was before, I have broke
all my Vows and Resolutions, drop'd my
Preparations, and how can I go about
the same Work again now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope it will not be too late,
you talk like a distracted Man; why 'tis
never too late to call upon God for
Mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but it may be too late
to obtain it; besides, when the Distemper
comes among us, what Time, what Tem∣per,
what Power to look up? what Ca∣pacity
to look in? what calling upon God
<PB N="184" REF="195"/>
in the Agonies of a Plague▪ Swelling,
or in the Distraction of the Fever? It is
too late, <HI>Brother,</HI> it should have been done
before; I am almost distracted already
with the Thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will distract your self and
me too at this rate, why what must be
done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may well say, Lord be merciful
to me; for I am at my Wits ends, and
know not what to do: I wish you would
let us shut up the Counting-House and
let us be gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be gone, whether shall we
go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, any where: I am sure I
shall never be able to stand it, my very
Heart dies within me at the Apprehensi∣ons
and fright of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must endeavour to
rouze up your Spirits and not be cast
down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Brother,</HI> whose Heart can
endure, or whose Hands be strong
in the Day that God shall deal with them?
God is now taking us all into his own
Hands; we shall no more be able to dally
with him repent and go back and re∣pent
again, and go back again: O'tis
dreadful Work to make a Jest of our Re∣pentance
as I have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="185" REF="196"/>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beseech you, <HI>Brother,</HI> Com∣pose
your self, you will die with the
Fright indeed at this rate; Come, I'll go
out and see what I can learn of it, and
what Measures are to be taken.</P>
<P>Thus this Discourse ended also, and the
elder <HI>Brother</HI> went out into the City, and
he found it to be all true as his <HI>Brother</HI>
had said; that the Plague now spread in∣to
several Parishes at the other end of the
Town, and that there was particularly
in the old Place, five of six Families In∣fected,
that is, at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s near <HI>Long-Acre,</HI>
and about the North End o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Drury-Lane;</HI>
also it spread down <HI>Drury Lane into</HI>
St. <HI>Clements</HI> Parish, and the other way
into St. <HI>Andrews, Holbourn;</HI> so that it ap∣parently
went forward towards the City,
and the next <HI>Weekly Bill</HI> had Nine Persons
put in of the Plague, besides those that
were Conceal'd.</P>
<P>The eldest <HI>Brother</HI> came home in the
Evening, and as he found all that his
<HI>Brother</HI> said was true, he was very anxious
about it, tho' he did not discover it so
much as his <HI>Brother;</HI> but in short, the
whole House was very Melancholly; it
is true the Younger's Melancholly was
different from the rest, and very parti∣cular,
because it was attended with a
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>
Sadness of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ther kind; I mean the great
Concern he was under for his future
State.</P>
<P>He had several Conversations upon the
Subject <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <HI>Brother,</HI> which chiefly
turn'd upon the Measures, that they
were to take to preserve themselves, and
to put their Business in a Posture to re∣ceive
as little Damage as Possible, by
so general interruption as it was like to
meet with on this Occasion; but as these
Things do not so nearly concern the Af∣fair
of religious Preparations, I have no
exact Account of them, nor are the Par∣ticulars
of any Value in this Discourse.</P>
<P>Thus much I learn from what I have
Collected, namely, that he did not receive
any manner of Satisfaction or Comfort
from his Eldest <HI>Brother,</HI> in the particular
Thing that afflicted him; and continu∣ing
very disconsolate, his pious <HI>Sister,</HI>
who was greatly concern'd for him,
came into his Chamber one Day about
ten Days after the first talk with his
<HI>Brother,</HI> where he was fitting very Pen∣sive
and Heavy, and began to Comfort
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> I am very sorry
to see you in this melancholly, discourag'd
<PB N="187" REF="198"/>
Condition; what can I do for you? 'tis a
sad time with us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Child, thou can'st do no∣thing
for me, but Pray for me, do that,
Child▪ however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray for you, <HI>Brother!</HI> that I
do always; but what am I that you
should ask me to pray for you? shall
I send for some good Minister to pray
with you, and for you, and to Comfort
you, that may be of some use to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Come sit down here,
thou art a good Comforter enough to
me, tell me <HI>my dear,</HI> what upholds your
Mind in this dismal time, for you have
the most Courage, and the most Com∣posure
of Mind, they say, of the whole
Family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, you are quite wrong;
my <HI>Brother</HI> out does us all, he is like one
above it all, that liv'd unshaken with any
Apprehensions whatever; he has a strong
Faith. O that I had a Heart so prepar'd,
so steady, so unconcern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sister, Sister,</HI> you mistake the
Point; my <HI>Brother,</HI> puts the Evil day far
from him, buoys himself up with Hopes
that the Judgment will pass over, and
that it is not so near or so certain, as
we have all reason to see it is; and he
flatters himself with this, or with escap∣ing
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
it if it comes: I tell you he has no
more Courage than other People; but I
think he is stupid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my <HI>Brother</HI> is a good
Man, I hope, he is not so secure in a time
of such Danger, but upon very good
Ground; he has a perfect Calm in his Mind
for ought I see▪ sure that can never be
but upon a firm Dependance upon God,
and a full Satisfiction of his future State.
O if I could arrive to that, if it were
God's Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to say, <HI>Sister</HI> that
you are mistaken; he knows nothing of
that happy Condition you speak of, nor
I neither; you are in a better State than
any of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> do not say so of me,
you grieve me extremely, I that am the
worst Creature alive what State can I
be in; I hope too you are wrong in the
Case of my <HI>Brother</HI> and your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is not a time <HI>Sister,</HI> to
flatter or compliment; the Judgments of
God are coming upon us, what must be
done? what is our Work, what is our
Duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>We talk of Preparations, and
some preach up early Preparations; I
know nothing we can do, but learn to
<PB N="189" REF="200"/>
die at the Feet of Christ, as miserable
Penitents; this is all I can come to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Sister,</HI> if I could do that, I
should think my self safe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will accept all that come
unto God by him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I should have come before;
to talk of it now, is to talk nothing; we
cannot be said to come now; we do not
come we are driven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, but so his Good∣ness
is pleas'd to act with us, that he
will accept those who are perswaded by
the Terrors of the Lord, as well as those
who are drawn by his Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no sincerity in coming
now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there is, <HI>Brother;</HI> many a
Criminal is accepted, even at the Place
of Execution, which may be call'd dri∣ving,
as much as any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard Work to repent
under Distress, and 'tis hard to entertain
Notions of our own Sincerity under such
Circumstances; how shall I prepare now,
that have not gone about it till the Judg∣ments
of God are upon us, and I am dri∣ven
to it, as it were in the Terrors of
Death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not discourage me, <HI>Brother,</HI>
while you discourage yourself, the Judg∣ment
<PB N="190" REF="201"/>
of God is begun, and we are to
prepare for it, that is to say to be ready
to meet him with our Souls prostrate
at his Feet: We are to say, it is the Lord,
let him do with us what seems good in
his Sight; and this is a Work proper to
go about, even now; I am sure I must
go about it now, as well as you; I entreat
you do not discourage me, I want all the
helps to it possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not discourage you, <HI>Sister;</HI>
you have been before Hand with the
Work; you have led a Life of Prepara∣tions
a great while; I have lost all the
time past, and that doubles the Work
for the time to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done nothing, and can do
nothing; neither can any of us do any
thing but submit and be resign'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must submit and be re∣sign'd
as to God's disposing of us; but
I speak of another Work, <HI>Sister,</HI> that lies
hard and heavy upon my Spirits: I have
a long mispent Life to look back upon,
I have an Ocean of Crimes to launch
thro', a Weight that sinks the Soul, and
without God's infinite Mercy will sink
it for ever; what is resigning to God's
disposal to this? no Man can resign to
be eternally lost; no Man can say he sub∣mits
to be rejected of God; I could chear∣fully
<PB N="191" REF="202"/>
submit to whatever it pleases God
to do with me here▪ whether to die or
to live; but I must be pardoned, Sin
must be done away, or I am lost and un∣done,
it cannot be said I can resign that
Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Brother,</HI> I did not mean so;
we must resign our Bodies, but we are
allowed to be humbly importunate for
the Pardon of our Sins▪ the Sanctifying
our Hearts, and the saving our Souls;
and then we shall do the other with
Chearfulness and Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother,</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Sister,</HI> now you come
to me; this Pardon is not to be obtain∣ed,
but upon a sincere Repentance and
a firm Faith in Christ; and this is the
Work I say I have still to do, and that
you have not neglected as I have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister,</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Brother,</HI> I have done little, I
have it every day to do as well as you,
and 'tis a Work must be renewed every
day, I desire to be every day applying
to it with all my Power, and I hope you
do so too▪ for we make fresh Work for
Repentance every day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a dreadful Work to have
to do at such a time as this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Brother,</HI> tho' the having
deferred our Repentance to the last Gasp,
be a discouraging thing, and that as you
<PB N="192" REF="203"/>
say, a Sick Bed or the time of Visitation,
is not a time for it, yet Blessed be God,
it is not forbidden then; it does not make
our Repentance unlawful, it only unfits
us for it; neither, as you suggest, does
repenting at last, make the Repentance be
less sincere, it may indeed render it sus∣pected
to ourselves; but it does not fol∣low
that it cannot be sincere because it
is late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>It takes away all the Com∣fort
of Repentance, that I am sure of, and
much of the hope of it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>But not to go about it at all, is
still worse, <HI>Brother.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to go about,
or when to go about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you know, <HI>Brother,</HI> both
what to do, and when.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>The time is laps'd, Death is
at the Door, what can be done now? it is
not, what our particular Frame or Tem∣per
may be just now, but what the
main Course and Tenor of Life has been,
we are to be judg'd according to our
Works.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, the Evil, I doubt is
at Hand, tho' I know nothing how it is;
my <HI>Brother</HI> told me, the Plague was ceas'd
again, and all was over; but I lay no
Stress upon that; I desire to be always
<PB N="193" REF="204"/>
what I should be, if it was upon me par∣ticularly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed 'tis far from being o∣ver,
'tis encreasing every Day, 'tis got
into three or four Parishes at the other
end of the Town, and it spreads this
way apace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Brother,</HI> 'tis a loud Call
upon us, to improve the few Days we
have left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I resolve not to lose a Mo∣ment,
but to apply the time that re∣mains,
as much as possible; but, alas!
what can I do? Is not all a meer Force?
a Fright, if the Sickness shou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d go off,
I shall be just the same again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You pass Sentence upon yourself
too rashly, <HI>Brother,</HI> you are no more
sure you shall do so, than you are sure
you shall go to Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a sad Rule to judge by;
I have done so once already, when we had
the same Apprehensions five Months ago,
and what can I say less? I shall be just
the same Man, for this is all the same
thing, 'tis being driven into a Harbour
by a Storm, as soon as the Storm is over
the Ship puts to Sea again, and goes on
the same Voyage she was going before,
and steers the same Course she steer'd
<PB N="194" REF="205"/>
before, and so shall I; I am only driven
upon my Knees by the Storm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, <HI>Brother,</HI> you know
the Story of the Prodigal, he was driven
by evident Misery and Starving, as bad
a Storm as any Man can be driven with;
he tells you, <HI>I perish for Hunger:</HI> He ne∣ver
thought of returning to his Father,
till he was ready to Perish, that is, just
at the Gate of Destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but a Parable, <HI>Sister.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>But remember, <HI>Brother,</HI> what
the Moral of it was, what the Design of
the Story was; and above all, who told
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, but what is that
Moral to my Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Brother,</HI> he that told that
Story with his own Mouth, is the same
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ather who is to accept of us Prodigals;
and, I think, he clearly tells us there,
that he will receive us, however late,
and by whatever Necessity or Distress
we are driven; what else did he tell us
that Story for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a comforting Applica∣tion
of it indeed, and I think it will
hold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is so seasonable to me, that

<P>I am no Preacher, <HI>Brother,</HI> I am

the Story of the Prodigal came into my
Head just then: I hope you are no Pro∣digal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I am a Prodigal, I
have wasted the Substance that I have
had given me; the Time, and Talents of
Health and Strength that has been spar'd
me, and now I am just like him, <HI>ready to

Do you consider the Numbers of Peo∣ple

my <HI>Sister</HI> talks of a Thousand a Week,
if it comes to be a thorough Infection,

Work, as well together as apart: Let us
set up our rest for Death, that is,
that we shall certainly die of this Visi∣tation;
and endeavour to bring our Souls
to such a Frame, as that we may
with Chearfulness throw our selves into
the Arms of Divine Mercy, thro' the
Merit of Jesus Christ, whenever he shall
Summons us, be it by this dreadful visi∣tation,

thinks fit.</P>

<P>I am very little able to for∣ward
you in such a Work; but I will

with respect to my own part, as to any

<P>But what do you look upon
to be the first Work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first thing I can think of,
is a full Resolution, a firm Purpose of
Heart, to forsake all our Sins, and to re∣turn
heartily to God who we have of∣fended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>By returning to God, I suppose
you understand repenting sincerely for
all our past Sins, mourning unfeignedly o∣ver
them, and calling upon God for
Pardon and Forgiveness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I do so, and there is great En∣couragement
for us to do this, in the
Scriptures.</HI> H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sea 6. 1. Come and let us
return unto the Lord: for he hath torn,

forsake his way, and the unrighteous man
his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord,
and he will have mercy upon him, and to our
God, for he will abundantly pardon. <HI>Isaiah.</HI>

Egypt, he shall smite and heal it, and they

the Lord of hosts shall bless, saying, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lessed be

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is another Text which
<PB N="203" REF="214"/>
touches my very Soul every time I read
it, methinks it speaks to me; it is the
very sort of turning that I think I want,
and it seems to be even a direction
to me how to turn, and what turning
to God means in his own Sense of it;
how he is pleas'd to understand it,
or what it is he will accept as a sincere
turning to him; it is in <HI>Joel</HI> Chap. 2. ver.
12, 13. <HI>Therefore also now, saith the Lord,
turn ye even to me with all your heart, and
with fasting, and with weeping, and with
mourning. And rent your heart and not your
garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for
he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</HI></P>

<P>That is an extraordinary place,
indeed, I had omitted it, but I remem∣ber
it very well, and the Words of the

for that particular Call of turning to
God, to be much the same with what is
before us.</P>

<P>I did not look at that part,
the Call was loud to me, and I see rea∣son

<P>Nay, they are the Words of

<P>This is a Call to us; to me,

<P>'Tis a Call to me, as well as to

<P>We have opportunity now to

<P>Here we can follow this happy Couple
no farther at present, <HI>that is,</HI> in their
particular Conversation, but it is to be
recorded for the Example and Encou∣ragement
of others, in like Case, that they
<PB N="206" REF="217"/>
agreed to spend two Hours every Even∣ing,
and an Hour every Morning toge∣ther
in her Closet, where they pray'd
together, read the Scripture together,
and discoursed together as their particu∣lar
Circumstances made it seasonable▪
In these retirements the <HI>Brother</HI> pray'd,
and made a daily Confession of Sin, the
<HI>Sister</HI> read the Scriptures, and in their
Discourses they were mutual.</P>
<P>Besides this, they lock'd themselves up
every <HI>Tuesday</HI> and <HI>Friday,</HI> and kept the
whole Day as a Solemn Fast, neither
Eating or Drinking 'till about Four a
Clock in the Afternoon; where it might be
truly said of them both, as was said of <HI>Me∣nassah,
That they humbled themselves greatly be∣fore
the Lord their God;</HI> and as the Scripture
above mentioned directed, they did it with
<HI>Fasting,</HI> with <HI>Weeping,</HI> and with <HI>Mourning.</HI></P>
<P>The young Man in particular, was a
Pattern for Penitents; and in an especial
Manner he was afflicted, and continual∣ly
reproach'd himself with having put off
his Preparation and Repentance formerly
'till the very Judgment was at the Door;
and with having been once before touch'd
with a like Sense of the Danger, but
growing cold and unconcern'd again, as
the Danger abated and went off: This
rob'd him of much of the Comfort of
<PB N="207" REF="218"/>
his present Application; and he continu∣ally
upbraided himself with it, as if it
was a Test of his future insincerity,
and it was very discouraging to him;
he would also frequently express himfelf
on that Head, how much it should be
consider'd by every one in such Cases,
never to fall back from their own Re∣solutions;
and how sad a Token it was
of real Hypocrisy; and particularly,
how hard it would be for such People,
if ever they came to be true Penitents,
to believe themselves so, or to receive
the Comfort of their own Humiliati∣ons.</P>
<P>In this distress of his Mind he receiv'd
great Assistance from the Comforting
Discourses, and excellent Example of his
Pious <HI>Sister,</HI> who was now the Compani∣on
of his best Hours, and his support in
his greatest discouragements.</P>
<P>She had given the first Life to his Re∣solutions,
by hinting to him, that our
Blessed Saviour himself was the Author
of that Parable of the Prodigal, and that
as it was said, introductory to the Para∣ble
of the unjust Judge, that he <HI>speaks a
Parable to them to</HI> THIS END, <HI>that Men
ought always to Pray and not to faint;</HI> so
that it might be said of the Parable of
the Prodigal, that he spake a Parable,
<PB N="208" REF="219"/>
TO THIS END, that Men ought always
to return to God their Father, when
they are in distress, and not to decline
for its being late. She had upon all Oc∣casions
repeated to him such encourag∣ing
Texts of Scripture as occur'd to her
to support his Resolutions; and she was
daily searching the Bible for such Tex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
of Scripture, as might be particularly
adapted to these Purposes.</P>
<P>It happened, that under some of his
greatest discouragements, for he had many,
and most of them beginning at the
Doubts he had upon his Mind, of his
own sincerity, and of his being accepted
because of his having not applied him∣self
to his Humiliation, till it pleased
God to bring the Terror of the Plague
upon him, and till the Judgment was,
as it were at the Door: I say under one
of these worst Dejections, his <HI>Sister</HI> thought
of another Example; Come, <HI>Brother,</HI> says
she, I have another Scripture Instance
for your Encouragement, where God ac∣cepted
one of the worst Wretches that e∣ver
was alive, and who never returned
till he was brought to the greatest Ex∣tremity,
a greater Instance of Wicked∣ness
never was in the World: Nor did
he ever think of returning, as we read
of, till God struck him and brought
<PB N="209" REF="220"/>
him down to the lowest degree of Mi∣sery;
and yet upon his humbling him∣self,
he was accepted: Will such an Ex∣ample
Comfort you? <HI>says she:</HI> I think,
says he, you were born to Comfort me,
Who was it? Here it is, says she, take
it as it is recorded on purpose to encou∣rage
Penitents under the worst Circum∣stances,
it is the Story of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nassah,</HI>
the most Wicked of all the Kings of
God's People, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 33. in the begin∣ning
of the Chapter to the 7th Verse,
you have an account of his Wickedness;
such as the like was never in <HI>Jerusalem</HI>
before him; doing abominable Things,
prophaning God's House and his Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r,
Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Sorcery, and dealing with
the Devil, also, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. 'tis said, <HI>the Lord
sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke to him, but he would not hearken:</HI> So
that he resisted even God himself, and
rejected the gracious Call of God to him
to Repent. This, <HI>Brother,</HI> was much
worse than what you call growing Cold
and Negligent, and letting your Sense
of Thir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s wear off: Well, after this,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. <HI>e the Lord brought upon them
the</HI> cant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns <HI>of the Host of the King of Assyria,
which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Mnass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng the thorns, and
bound him with oetters, and carried him to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lon.</HI> This was driving him, as you
call it, with a witness; he was pull'd
<PB N="210" REF="221"/>
down from a Throne to a Dungeon;
from a Crown of Gold and Chains of
Gold as Ornaments, to Chains of Iron
to Fetter and Bind him, as one kept for
Execution; but see ver. 12, 13. <HI>And when he
was in affliction, he besought the Lord his
God, and humbled himself greatly before the
God of his fathers. And prayed unto him, and
he was entreated of him, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d heard his suppli∣cation,
and brought him again to Jerusalem into
his own kingdom. Then Manass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h knew that
the Lord he was God.</HI> Now <HI>Brother,</HI> says
she, what think you of all this? Tears
of Joy run down his Face while she read
the Words of the two last Verses; and
when she ask'd him at last what he
thought of it; think of it, <HI>says he,</HI> my
Dear <HI>Sister!</HI> my happy Comforter! I think I
will never be discourag'd more; and he
was in a great Degree as good as his
Word, for he was exceedingly encourag'd
by it upon all Occasions, had recourse to
that Example, when his reflection upon
his late Repentance gave him any sad
Thoughts.</P>
<P>But he leaves it as a seasonable Caution
for us, upon whom the like Circumstance
of a National Visitation seem to be com∣ing;
that our Preparations may not be ad∣journ'd
till the Judgment is upon us; for
that, tho' it may not be in effectual thro'
<PB N="211" REF="222"/>
God's Mercy for any one to repent then,
however late, yet that it will rob us of
great Comfort, make the Danger a Thou∣sand
times more dreadful, and fill
us always with dark and discouraging
Thoughts, and 'twill be very hard to bear
up the Mind under them.</P>
<P>He warns all Men by his own Ex∣ample,
that when Preparations for Death
have been long put off, 'tis so much the
harder to begin them at all, and the
Heart once harden'd by frequent delay∣ing
and putting it off, is not easily soften'd
to the serious Work again; and when
it shall at last be brought to go about
it heartily, it will yet go with a heavy
and afflicted Mind, and those delays of
Repentance will be the most abhorr'd
Things, even equal to the Sins that are
to be repented of; that nothing is more
certain, then that when People put off
those Preparations to the last, God is of∣ten
pleas'd in Justice to deny the Gift of
Repentance in their Extremity, or at
least for a great while, and sometimes
the Comfort of it to the last Gasp; but
this is a Digression: I proceed to the
Story of the Family before me.</P>
<P>These two happy Penitents went on
in this Course for some time; some short
Discourses which happened between them,
<PB N="212" REF="223"/>
cou'd they have been entirely preserv'd,
might have been very useful to others,
the following however, may not be un∣profitable;
the <HI>Brother,</HI> it being during one
of their private Fasts, as above, began
thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sister,</HI> we are under the Ap∣prehension
of a terrible Judgment, which
is already begun, and encreases dreadful∣ly
among us; pray let us state between
us, what is our Work upon that account
at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I understand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Brother<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
you would have us state what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean
by Preparations, for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se are the things
we talk much of, and others too <HI>when
they</HI> speak of any serious things, indeed
I have often ask'd my self, what I mean
by Preparations for the Plague?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and how did you answer
your own Question?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I answer'd it as I heard
you mention it once to my <HI>Brother,</HI> and
I thought you had given a very right
account of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that Preparations
for the Plague were Preparations for
Death, and that they ought to be under∣stood
so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the Question is
much the same then, (<HI>viz.</HI>) what is it
to make Preparations for Death? or what
<PB N="213" REF="224"/>
what Preparations are proper to be made
for Death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a hard Question, <HI>Brother,</HI>
and requires a better Head than mine
to give an answer to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother,</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>Sister,</HI> that which is worse,
is that the Preparations I mean, are to
be supposed to be made, by a Man that
has been a hardened extravagant remark∣able
Wretch, for great Crimes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>One that has been old in Sin,
and that has put off all the Calls to Re∣pentance,
either from Conscience or from
Nature, from Reason or from Religion,
from God or from Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, just as I have done, <HI>Sister!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, not as you have done,
but as you say you have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let that rest; what must
such a one do? what must be his Pre∣parations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first thing, <HI>Brother,</HI> I think
of, is included in that Scripture, <HI>Lam.</HI> 3.
40. <HI>Let us search and try our ways, and turn
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto the Lord.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thing is most apt to the
Purpose, <HI>search and try our ways,</HI> which, as
I understand it is self Examination in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Extreme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Searching; that is, a looking back
upon our past Life, and into every Acti∣on
<PB N="214" REF="225"/>
of it; not hiding or dropping this
Search in any particular part that can
be brought to Memory; not covering any
part, but searching our selves to the
Bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then trying the quallity
of every Action, bringing ourselves to
the Bar of our Consciences, and there
impartially subjecting every Action of
our Lives, to the Judgment of our own
Reason, and Conscience; determining
with an unbyass'd Sincerity, whether such
Ways and such Actions are justifiable at
the Bar of God, or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blessed be God, there is a Bar
of Conscience, at which we may Arraign
our selves, and where, if we try the Cause
impartially, we may make a right Judg∣ment
of our Actions, and know in what
Posture we stand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>But O <HI>Sister,</HI> what is my Case!
I see before hand what will be my Case;
I cannot stand before the Judgment Seat
of my own Heart, how then shall I ap∣pear
at his enlighten'd Tribunal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not say you are so, as if
none were so but you; I am in the same
Condition, my own Heart condemns me,
and God is greater than our Hearts: I
have nothing to say but this, <HI>Enter not
<PB N="215" REF="226"/>
into Judgment with me O Lord, for in thy sight
shall no Man living be justified,</HI> Psalm 142.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>If then we bring our Actions
to the Bar of Reason, and to the Bar of
Conscience faithfully, we shall see then
our state; we shall see what our Condi∣tion
is, and what it will be at the Bar
of God's Judgment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly we may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must see, and do see,
that at that Bar I shall be Condemned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Brother,</HI> and I too and every
one, for <HI>in his sight shall no man living be
justify'd:</HI> In the state as our own Actions
brought to Judgment will appear; but
let us go back to the Text again, <HI>let us
search and try our ways;</HI> What is next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so Blessed be God; <HI>let us
search and try, and turn again to the Lord,</HI>
this is then our Work at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> our Work in short,
is Self-Examination, and Repentance;
first Examination, then Humiliation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain, <HI>first search and try
our ways,</HI> and then, <HI>turn from them to the
Lord;</HI> it is taken there as a Conclusion,
that upon searching and trying our ways,
we shall find they will not bear a Trial,
either at the Bar of God, or at the Bar
of Conscience; therefore we are to turn
from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="216" REF="227"/>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is our next Work, and
how is that to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>That brings us to the other
Text we had before, 2 <HI>Joel 12, 13. It must
be with all our hearts, with fasting, with
weeping and with mourning.</HI> How shall we
do this, <HI>Sister?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Brother,</HI> but let us go on
and see the Fruit of it too, read the
next Verse 5. 13. <HI>And rent your heart and
not your garments, and turn unto the Lord
your God: for he is gracious and merciful,
slow to anger, and of great kindness, and re∣penteth
him of the evil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, <HI>Sister,</HI> go on with them
<HI>ver.</HI> 14. who knoweth if he will Return
and Repent, and leave a Blessing behind
him. Here's encouragement, <HI>Sister!</HI> let
us set about this Work, for <HI>he is gracious
and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
kindness.</HI></P>
<P>Here is one of their Discourses, or at
least a Part, and herein may be seen some∣thing
of that true Work of Preparation
for the Plague: Let none flatter them∣selves
with less than this; they who
pretend to be making Preparations for
the Plague, that is to say, for Death,
any other way than by searching and try∣ing
their ways and turning to the Lord,
with fasting, with weeping, and with
<PB N="217" REF="228"/>
mourning, that is to say, with sincere
Humiliation and Repentance, will but
mock and deceive themselves, and will
find they have made no Preparations at
all.</P>
<P>I must leave this pious Couple now a
while, as to their retreat, and take them
in Common, in Conversation with their
<HI>Brother</HI> and the Family. The Visitation
came on, the Plague spread dreadfully,
Death come like an Armed Man, and
swept away the People like an over∣flowing
Stream.</P>
<P>It was now five Weeks after the last
Discourse between the two <HI>Brothers</HI> and
the <HI>Sister,</HI> and since the two Penitents
had retir'd themselves; that the younger
<HI>Brother</HI> having been out in the City came
in again, and found his Elder <HI>Brother</HI>
talking with his <HI>Sister;</HI> and now his man∣ner
of talking was quite chang'd, his Tale
was turn'd, as you shall see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Brother,</HI> Why will you ven∣ture
to go out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out, why what can be done?
we must go out for Family Necessaries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have been greatly over∣seen
in that, not to have a Store of Pro∣visions
in the House, since we are oblig'd
<PB N="218" REF="229"/>
to stay, you know they did quite other∣wise
at <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, but it is too
late now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not too late for some
Things, however we might get a stock
of Bread and Beer into the House, and
you see my <HI>Mother</HI> sends us every Week
fresh Provisions from the Country suf∣ficient
for us in particu∣lar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She does just now, but it will
not be long; no Messenger or Servant
will dare to bring it, in a little more time,
for the Plague Increases so much, the
other end of the Town is a meer De∣solation
with it; it begins to come round
us, I hear 'tis got over into <HI>Southwark</HI>
this Week, six or eight have died on that
side already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what shall we resolve
to do? shall we venture to stay, or shall
we lock up our Doors and be gone?
what say you, <HI>Sister?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not fit to give my Opinion,
I see 'tis like to be a dreadful time, but
what you resolve, shall determine me;
because as I have undertaken the Charge
of your House, your Measures makes
staying my Duty or not my Duty; so
you are not to ask my Opinion, but to
direct me what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="219" REF="230"/>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if you were not un∣der
the Obligation you speak of, <HI>Child,</HI>
which you may be sure we would be far
from tying you to in such a Case as this,
what would you do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I should properly be∣long
to my <HI>Mothers</HI>'s Family, and I ought
to go thither, and then to act as she
should direct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell us what you think
of doing now, <HI>Child?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may assure your self I will
do just as you do, I will live and die with
you.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This she meant of her second <HI>Brother</HI> in Particular, because of the Work they were engag'd in together.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all nothing; what we
do we must do quickly, there's no time
for long Consultations, if we intend to
go away, it must be speedily, or no
Body will receive us; nay, we may carry
the Plague with us, and do our selves
more hurt than good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, all the World almost
that have any where to go, are gone al∣ready;
but have you thought of any
place where to go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="220" REF="231"/>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Brother,</HI> have you made
no Provision at all for the time of Distress?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No not I, Soul nor Body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At this Word he fetch'd a great Sigh, for he spoke it in a kind of secret Passion, and broke out into Tears after it; but when the Agony was a little over he went on.</NOTE></P>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Sister,</HI> you have been in the
right all along and my <HI>Mother</HI> too; I
have put this Evil day off, and flatter'd
my self it would go off: I have seen such
things frequently in <HI>Italy,</HI> and after the
first Frights, the Distemper has vanish'd
again: I was indeed alarm'd when I came
to you there in <HI>April,</HI> but I found there
were some People, who I thought, made
worse of it than they need to do, and I
dropt all Concern about it, nor have I
suffer'd any Impressions to be made upon
me since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I took it otherwise, <HI>Brother,</HI> and
I always thought it was on other way;
that you were fortify'd by your Extraor∣dinary
Experiences of God's Goodness
and your Faith in him; and that I knew
was a good and justifiable Foundation
for you, to be easy and settl'd in your
Mind on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I am quite unprepar'd,
and that with this Aggravation, that I have
<PB N="221" REF="232"/>
neglected and slighted all the Warnings
of its Approach; and now it comes on
like an overflowing Flood, nothing can
stand in its Way; we shall see the City
in a very little time more, a meer gene∣ral
Grave for all its Inhabitants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not all, I hope, <HI>Brother.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I believe there will

<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Brother,</HI> we are all to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
directed by you; what shall we do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! I have nothing to say to
you, but this, do not follow my dread∣ful
Example, to put off my Repentance
and Preparation upon a wild Presumption
of escaping the Danger, or indeed of its
being more favourable than it is like to
be; lose not an Hour, not a Moment;
I have lost all my time, and now, Hea∣ven
is just! I not only have no time for
it, but I have no Temper for it; when
the Danger is at the Door there's no
beginning the Work; 'tis too late then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Compose your Mind, <HI>Brother,</HI>
and look up to Heaven for Direction;
and if you think of going any where for
your safety into the Country, my <HI>Sister</HI>
and I will remain here to look to the
House and preserve things.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="222" REF="233"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Brother,</HI> I wont go away
for my own Safety and leave you expos'd
to the Danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope it may please God to
preserve us; but if not, we are in the way
of our Duty, and may with the more
chearfulness cast ourselves into his Arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk very different, <HI>Bro∣ther,</HI>
from your Discourse a few Months
ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have had long Experience of
things since that, and particularly of the
right he has to dispose of me, and all
that belongs to me; it is my part to
submit, 'tis his part to do whatsoever
he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I want such a Spirit, <HI>Brother:</HI>
How did you get it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pointing to his <HI>Sister,</HI> who he said had been the Cause of all the serious things he had done during the whole time.</NOTE> the dear Instructor,
she has been the healing Angel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I intreat you, <HI>Brother,</HI> do not
discourage your self so, I have been ca∣pable
of nothing, and have done nothing,
neither can any of us do any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you came in, <HI>Brother,</HI>
since I did, what do you hear of the main
thing, what Condition are we in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="223" REF="234"/>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Worse and Worse, the Plague
advances this way still in a most surpriz∣ing
Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what shall we do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scarce know what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short there's no Body left
in the City hardly, but in By-places, and
where People either have had no time to
go, as has been our Case, or resolve to
stay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us see a little farther,
<HI>Brother,</HI> there are but very few dead in
the City yet, I think not above Fifty or
Sixty in all.</P>
<P>This Discourse being ended, the second
<HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Sister</HI> began to consider that
it would be their lot to stay in the City;
but being very anxious for their Elder
<HI>Brother,</HI> they resolv'd to perswade him
to go away, chiefly with respect to the
Confusion which they found he was in
about his eternal State: In the mean time
as they kept up their daily Conferences
and Fasts as before, they were every
day more and more Encourag'd and
Comforted, being fully given up to the
disposing Will o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heaven, Iet it be
which way it would, whether for Life
or Death.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="235"/>
But to bring them to this gradually,
we must go back to another of their
Discourses upon this Subject in one of
their retirements; the <HI>Brother</HI> began the
Conference upon the Subject of the last
Discourse thus:</P>
<P>Dear <HI>Sister,</HI> I thought we brought our
last Discourse to a very happy Point,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That after Self-Examination, <HI>search∣ing
and trying our ways, we should turn to
the Lord:</HI> I have had some difficulties
with my self upon this Work of turn∣ing
to God; we resolv'd it at our last
meeting into Repentance; and I think
that is plain in the Text we were up∣on,
<HI>turn with fasting and weeping and mourn∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>This I take to be Repentance; but is
there nothing to do beside? alas, we may
weep and mourn, but as that can make
no Compensation for our Sin, we must
look farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, there is more to
be done, but the Scripture is full and plain
even in that, for the Word, <HI>turn to the
Lord,</HI> implies, in my Judgment, flying
to him for Pardon; it is true, that
the manner of applying to God for
Pardon of our Sins, is not express'd in
the Prophesy of <HI>Joel;</HI> because they were
<PB N="225" REF="236"/>
then under the old Testament Dispensa∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother,</SPEAKER>
<P>That is what my though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
resolv'd it into; now, <HI>Sister,</HI> I bring it to
the <HI>New Testament,</HI> and I was directed, I
hope to that Scripture, <HI>Acts</HI> 16. 30. where
the Jaylor says, <HI>Sirs what must I do to be
saved?</HI> The very Words were upon my
Mind before the particular Scripture
occur'd to my Thoughts, what is my
next Work? What must I do to be
sav'd? and the Answer is directed,
ver. 31. <HI>And they said, Believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and
thy house.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is most certain, <HI>Brother,</HI> that
to our Repentance, which we have been
call'd to, by that Text which we discours'd
of last, must be join'd the Gospel Direc∣tion
of believing on the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI>
and that is the next Work for us to Exa∣mine
our selves about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain, <HI>Sister,</HI> from another
Text, 20, 21. <HI>Repentence towards God and
Faith, towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Brother,</HI> if we have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
these, we have finish'd our Preparations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we may say, <HI>come Lord
Jesus come quickly.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next question then is to be
assur'd in these two Points.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="226" REF="237"/>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Sister,</HI> I have nothing for
it but the Example of the Man, in the
<HI>Gospel, Mark 9. 24. Lord I believe, help my
Ʋnbelief:</HI> And this is the full Exercise of
my Soul; this is what I desire to dedicate
the whole remainder of my Time to, be
it little or much to obtain a settl'd De∣pendance
upon the Merits and Purchase
of Christ the Blessed Saviour of the
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no other Comfortable
Hope, no other Rock, no Anchor for the
Soul, but this, he is the Hope of his
People, and their Saviour in the Time of
Trouble. This is a time of Trouble, let
us not be anxious, whether we are spar'd
or not, in this time of Trouble; That
Faith which has carried others through
the Fire, and through the Water, will car∣ry
us through the Fire of a Disease: What
is it to die by this infectious Fever, or
being spared a few Years more, be car∣ried
away by another or by any grievous
Distemper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Difference is nothing if it
be not in things beyond the Grave, for
the difference of the time here is so little,
that it is not worth naming, at least
when we come into that state, we shall
esteem it nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="227" REF="238"/>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us then neither wish or fear
in the present desolation, but be entirely
resign'd, giving up ourselves to him, who
has said▪ <HI>he careth for us,</HI> and has bid us
be careful for nothing; this will be a Com∣fortable
State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear <HI>Sister,</HI> I have been debat∣ing
long with myself about the Comfort
of our Faith, and about a comfortable
Dependance: And I have been long que∣stioning
whether ever I may arrive to the
Comfort of it or no, whether the Joy and
Peace of believing may ever be my Lot:
And I have some reason to believe it
will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope for you, that it may,
pray do not foreclose your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have such a Weight upon
me for a long series of Folly and Wick∣edness,
that the more <HI>I search and try
my ways,</HI> the more I see reason to turn to
the Lord with weeping and with mourn∣ing:
And I believe I shall go so to my
Grave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; but let me add
to you, that it does not follow but you
may go so to Heaven, and then all
those Tears shall be wip'd away from
your Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have sometimes brought it
to this, and Blessed be God for it, that
<PB N="228" REF="239"/>
tho' Repentance and Faith, be absolute∣ly
necessary to our Salvation, yet com∣fort
and assurance is not, and then I re∣member
the Words of <HI>Job. Tho' he stay
me, yet will I trust in him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Faith is as effectual, tho'
not so comfortable as the other; this is
my Case, I know he is able to help and
to save to the uttermosst, and I desire
to lie at his Feet and say, as the Apostles,
<HI>Whether else shall we go?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my Faith will support it
self thus far, that I can lie down and
die at his Feet, I will not say 'tis all I can
desire, but I do say, 'tis all I can expect;
and 'tis just with him if he should deny
me even that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot promise or propose
to our selves what we shall do when we
come to the Extremity: Dear <HI>Brother,</HI>
this is such a time of Trial as we never had
before, nor older People than we are, it
pleases God we are yet alive; but Death
is at the Door, and we have reason to
expect it every Moment, and that a ter∣rible
Death too: Nothing can stand us
instead, but an entire dependance upon
infinite Mercy, thro' the Merits of <HI>Jesus
Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brother</SPEAKER>
<P>I propose nothing to my self,
but to depend upon him, and to look to
<PB N="229" REF="240"/>
him for Life; for he is <HI>the author of eternal
Salvation, to all that Believe on him:</HI> I de∣sire
to believe in him, and I rest on him;
and this is all my Preparations for this
dreadful Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know no other Preparation, and
I trust that this Preparation will carry
us through whatever it shall please God
to suffer us to meet with, in this dread∣ful
time that is upon us.</P>
<P>For sometime both before and after this
Discourse, the Plague violently Increa∣sing,
their Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> had been very
pressing with them to leave the Town
and shift all for themselves; but these
two well prepar'd Souls, seem'd to receive
that part of his Proposal coldly, and be∣gan
to look upon themselves as determin'd
for stay, seeing their <HI>Brother,</HI> whose Mo∣tions
they had resolved at first to be guid∣ed
by, as the head of the Family, had
not talked of going a way till it was almost
impracticable to be done; they had made
no Provision, either for leaving the House
and Family in Trust with any Body, or
securing what in such Cases might be,
and was fit to be secur'd: They had
provided no Country Being, or Place to
retreat to; the Elder <HI>Brother</HI> indeed, had
a House of his own, and an Estate with
<PB N="230" REF="241"/>
it as far off as <HI>Cheshire;</HI> but it was not
possible to carry any thing of Goods or
Necessaries so far; especially after they
had let it alone so to the last, the ordinary
Carriers ceas'd going for sometime, and
besides all, there was no passing the Roads;
the Towns were all Guarded, the Passages
stop'd; and tho' they had gotten Certi∣ficates
of Health from the <HI>Lord Mayor;</HI>
the City began now to be so Infected that
no Body would receive them, no Inn
would lodge them on the Way: And
these Things had made their removing
next to impracticable; so I say, the se∣cond
<HI>Brother</HI> and his <HI>Sister,</HI> concluded
they were to stay.</P>
<P>They were, <HI>as above,</HI> come to a happy
and steady Calm of Mind with respect to
the Danger of Death; besides their pri∣vate
retirement, went together twice
every day, to commit their Souls in a
more solemn Manner into the Hands
of God; hitherto the Infection had not
only been kept out of their House but
out of their Neighbourhood; no Bo∣dy
had died or been Infected, as they
had heard of, in that part of the Street
where they liv'd; but as it was now the
latter end of <HI>July,</HI> the City seem'd like a
place Invested and Besieg'd, for tho' the
Plague was not so violent within the
<PB N="231" REF="242"/>
Walls as without, yet it was more or
less in most parts of the City.</P>
<P>They had for sometime left off to bury
the Dead in the usual Forms, and in the
Out-parts especially, Carts were appointed
to go thro' the Streets between the Hours
of Twelve and Three in the Night,
with a Bell-man, Crying, <HI>Bring out your
Dead?</HI></P>
<P>It was not 'till the first Week in
<HI>August,</HI> that this dreadful Sound was
heard within the Walls; and at first it
was principally in those Parishes which
were next the City Walls, on the Side
of <HI>Cripplogate</HI> and <HI>Bishopsgate,</HI> and that Week
there died of all Diseases above 4000.</P>
<P>Their Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> came in the Week
before this, in a very great Concern, hav∣ing
been at the <HI>Custom-House,</HI> or that Way,
where he had some Ware-Houses of
Goods, and had met with some frightful
Thing in his Way; and finding his <HI>Bro∣ther</HI>
and <HI>Sister</HI> together, he breaks out
in a Tone, rather of Horror than Anger.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Brother,</HI> says he, my <HI>Sister</HI> and
you may do what you please, but in short
I can stand it no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My <HI>Sister</HI> and I too are wil∣ling
to do whatever you direct, <HI>Brother;</HI>
but it has been left among us as a thing
<PB N="232" REF="243"/>
undetermin'd so long, that I do not see
how it can be done now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be as much Danger,
<HI>Brother,</HI> in going as in staying; for I be∣lieve
you have not yet resolv'd whe∣ther
to go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I have not; I have
done by my Family as I have done by
my Soul, let it lie without any Concern
about it, till it is too late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beseech you do not say so,
your Family indeed may find it too late
to stir, but blessed be the Lord, your
Soul is in better Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scarce know what hands I
am in, I am at my Wits Ends, I'll take
my Horse and go to <HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is giving us your Order to
stay where we are, for you know we can∣not
Travel so far as Circumstances now
stand, unless we should resolve to lie in
the Fields and starve, for no Body would
take us in.</P>

<P>You have seen Accounts, <HI>Bro∣ther,</HI>
of several Families that have been
put to all manner of Distresses upon the
Roads on this very account, and some
are come back again to <HI>London,</HI> chu∣sing
to meet the worst in their own
<PB N="233" REF="244"/>
Houses, rather than to wander in the
Fields and Roads, where no Body will
let them in, or come near them, or let
them pass from place to place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to do, I must
go some where, I am not able to stay
here, my very Blood runs cold in my
Veins at what I have met with to day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why will you go out into the
Streets, <HI>Brother?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I do not think to go
any more, till I go away for good and
all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hitherto, <HI>Brother,</HI> we have
been kept, who knows but it may please
God to spare us, let us keep within
Doors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How shall we get Provisions?
my <HI>Mother's</HI> Servant that furnishes us
now, said the last time he came that he
was frighted as he came through the
<HI>Borrough,</HI> and that he should be afraid
to come much oftner.</P>
<P>While they were under these Debates,
for it held them there or four Days,
there came a Captain of a Ship up to the
House, whose Ship they (the two <HI>Brothers</HI>)
were Owners of, and had fitted out for
a Voyage to <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Messina,</HI> where
their chief Dealing lay, and where it
seems they had liv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="245"/>
They were upon one of these Discourses
it seems, when this Captain came into
the Counting-House for some Dispatches
which he wanted; where he found his chief
Merchant under great Perplexity about
the encreases of the Plague, and he be∣gan
himself to tell him, that he wonder'd
he had not remov'd his Family all this
while; upon which the following Dis∣course
began between those two only,
for the second <HI>Brother</HI> was gone up Stairs
with his <HI>Sister.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> I perceive you are in some
perplexity about your Family in this
dreadful time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Captain,</HI> so I am, my
<HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Sister</HI> too, who are our Go∣vernours,
would have had me left them,
have remov'd into the Country two
Months ago, and I laugh'd at them and
slighted it, but now I must own I wish
with all my Heart I had done it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you told them how
you us'd to do Abroad, where they make
light of such Things, they are so fre∣quent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I did indeed, and I told my
<HI>Brother</HI> I thought he had known better,
that had liv'd at <HI>Naples,</HI> where they say
there died 20000 in one Day, tho', <HI>by the
way,</HI> it was not true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="235" REF="246"/>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray <HI>Sir,</HI> Why do you not
go away still, this Side of the City and
the <HI>Rotherith</HI> Side of the River is pretty
clear yet, you may all go away that
way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake the Case extremely,
<HI>Captain,</HI> we may go out of the Town
several ways still, but there's no stirring
any where when we are out; there's not
a Town upon the Road will suffer any
Body to pass that comes from <HI>London?</HI>
or from any Town near <HI>London;</HI> so that
it is impossible to Travel, we must e'en
stay all and die here, I see no remedy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here the Captain mus'd a while, and said no∣thing, which made the <HI>Merchant</HI> go on.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wat makes you seem surpriz'd at that,
<HI>Captain,</HI> it cannot be wonder'd at, nor
can we blame the People; for who wou'd
venture to lodge a Family from <HI>London;</HI>
I mean what Inn would venture it, and
have the Plague brought among them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not surpriz'd at that part
at all; indeed I was not thinking of
it, I was at first surpriz'd to think you,
<HI>Sir,</HI> that had so much Knowledge of these
Things, should not have made Prepara∣tion
for your Family's retreat a great
while before it came; for you have had
<PB N="236" REF="247"/>
notice that it was coming on above these
six Months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Captain!</HI> wonder no more, we
have done by the Family as we do by
our Souls, put off the Apprehensions,
and that puts off the Preparations, and
now it is upon us, we are all in Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but that was not what I
paus'd at, I have a Proposal in my
Thoughts that you may if you please,
with God's Blessing, convey your Fa∣mily
out of the City still, and that to such
a Distance, as you may at least hope to
be safe, and you shall meet with no
stops upon the Road at all, tho' you
Travel a great way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Gentleman was exceedingly pleas'd with the Kindness of the Proposal.</NOTE> We will be all greatly oblig'd
to you for such a Proposal, nothing can
be more acceptable at a time of such
extremity; for we look upon ourselves
as all dead Bodies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have but one question to ask
by way of Caution; but if that cannot
be answer'd, I can do nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I can guess at that que∣stion,
the Nature of the Thing guides
<PB N="237" REF="248"/>
to it, (<HI>viz.</HI>) whether we have not the
Distemper already among us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the Question indeed,
<HI>Sir,</HI> for if that cou'd not be answer'd,
you know no Body could expect to be
assisted, neither cou'd any Body assist
them, for they would carry Death with
them, where ever they should go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you may be assur'd, and
depend upon it, that we are all of us,
<HI>Blessed be God,</HI> Servants and all, as free
from the Infection or from any Distem∣per
at present, as ever we were in our
lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, <HI>Sir,</HI> the short of the
Story is this; have not I a Ship here in
the River? and is she not your own?
except a sixteenth, which I have by your
Friendship and one sixteenth my <HI>Brother,</HI>
who will Consent to whatever shall be
for your Service: Here we have Victuals
for her, for four Months for twenty two
Men, and have put her up on the <HI>Ex∣change</HI>
for <HI>Genoa, Naples,</HI> and <HI>Messina,</HI>
but we have taken in no Goods, but
some Hogsheads of <HI>Sugar,</HI> for your own
Account, and about 50 Fodder of <HI>Lead,</HI>
for Ballast, also of your own; nor as
things are now, will any Body Ship off
any thing, for all Trade is at a stand;
besides, 'tis to no purpose to go to Sea,
<PB N="238" REF="249"/>
for no Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> will give us
Product, or let us so much as come to
an Anchor in any of their Ports.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put a new Thought in my
Head I confess. Why <HI>Captain,</HI> would you
take us on Board?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will I take you on Board? Is
she not your own Ship? Is she not fitted
out at your Expence? You may, and
have a right to Command her and turn
me a Shoar if you think fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but are you willing to take
us in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt,</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you ask that Question,
<HI>Sir?</HI> why else do I make that Proposal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where does your Ship lie now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did lie, <HI>Sir,</HI> at <HI>Rotherhith,</HI> in
that they call <HI>Cherry-Garden-Hole,</HI> but
you know you order'd me to Fall down
to <HI>Deptford,</HI> and there we Ride ready to
Fall down lower if we see Occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you room for us all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we will make room for you
as convenient as if it were in your own
House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mer.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sit down again, <HI>Captain;</HI> Come
I'll propose it to my <HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Sister,</HI>
and hear what they say to it, for I con∣fess
your Offer comes to me, as if it came
from Heaven, 'tis as if it was a Voice
from above, a Message to save us all
<PB N="239" REF="250"/>
from the most dreadful Condition that
ever Family was in; I wonder I should
never think of it before.</P>
<P>Upon this he call'd his <HI>Brother</HI> and
<HI>Sister;</HI> and gave them an account of the
<HI>Captain's</HI> Proposal, and of his own Opini∣on
of it: They both said the same, that
it seem'd to be a merciful Disposition
of Providence, for the Deliverance of the
whole Family; and the second <HI>Brother</HI> and
<HI>Sister</HI> receiv'd it with Acknowledgments
suitable to their Opinion of it as such.</P>
<P>In short, the <HI>Merchant</HI> and the <HI>Captain</HI>
immediately entred into Measures for the
putting it in Execution; and to this pur∣pose,
he caused Beds and Bedding, Linnen
of all sorts; with all Kinds of Kitchen
Furniture, and all other Family Neces∣saries,
to be pack'd up in Cases and Boxes
and Bales, as if for the Use of Passengers,
with all their Plate and Things of Value,
and had it fetch'd away by the Ships
long Boat, and another Boat which they
borrowed, for three Days together, not
suffering the Ship's Men or any of them
to come on Shoar, but had it all put on
Board by his own Servants; at the same
time the Merchant caused the Ship's Bills,
which we hung up on the <HI>Exchange,</HI> in∣timating
that She was ready to take in
Goods for <HI>Italy,</HI> to be taken down; tho'
<PB N="240" REF="251"/>
if he had not, there was no great forward∣ness
in any Merchants to Ship any Goods
at that time.</P>
<P>All these three Days the <HI>Captain</HI> took
to lay in a larger Store of Provisions,
and particularly, of Fresh Provisions;
and first he dismiss'd all the Men he had
hir'd for the Voyage, except those who
were already actually on Board, who
were his Chief-Mate, Boatswain, Carpen∣ter
and Six Seamen or Fore mast Men;
and these he forbid to set their Feet on
Shoar or on Board any other Ship on
pain of being turn'd off.</P>
<P>The History of this Embarkation, tho'
not material to the Subject in Hand; I
mean as to the religious Preparations for
the Plague: I yet cannot think proper
to omit, because it may be a direction
for others to take the same happy Mea∣sures
in the like Danger, and perhaps
with as good Success; for this, as you
will hear, succeeded very well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Captain</HI> was a good Agent Victu∣aller,
he laid in a double quantity of
Biscuit, Meal, Beer, Beef, Peas, Fish, and
every thing usual in furnishing a Ship
for a Voyage; but that was not all,
he put on Board a quantity of Hay,
and bought two Cows, making a Plat
Form for them in the Hold, which had
<PB N="241" REF="252"/>
vacancy enough: He bought a great
quantity of Fowls, and twelve Sheep; two
or three Sows with Pigs, and the like:
And in short, made Provision to a Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion;
and this he did with such Expe∣dition,
that every thing was on Board
before them.</P>
<P>The Ship was now fully ready for them
to go on Board, and the Boat was order'd
to come up to <HI>Tower Wharf,</HI> to take in
the Family as on the <HI>Wednesday;</HI> when
on the Sabbath day in the Afternoon
their <HI>Sister</HI> was taken very Ill, which put
them all into a terrible Fright, she con∣tinued
exceeding Ill, and particularly,
Vomited violently all Monday, and they
made no doubt but it was the Plague.</P>
<P>She carry'd it with an extraordinary
Composu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Mind, meekly committing
her self into the Hands of him, on whose
Mercy she had so long depended; in a
Word, she shew'd eminently the diffe∣rence
between a Mind solemnly Prepar'd
for Death, and which in earnest had
long expected it; and a Thoughtless negli∣gent
one, who had put the Evil day
far from him.</P>
<P>However, as her Distemper was not
the Plague, she soon began to mend, her
Vomiting abated, and she recover'd
Strength; but I mention it to observe
<PB N="242" REF="253"/>
the Condition of her Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> upon
this Occasion: Now, and not till now,
he was thoroughly alarmed; he was fright∣ed
and terrify'd before with the Danger
he was in; but now he look'd upon it
that God had struck his Family, and
that they should all die of the Plague
very quickly.</P>
<P>He got no sleep that Night, when in
the middle of the Night, between Twelve
and One a Clock, he heard for the first
time, that dismal Cry, <HI>Bring out your
Dead!</HI> the Cart begining to go thro' the
Street where he liv'd, being the Parish
of St. <HI>Margaret Pattons,</HI> that very Night:
The Noise of the Bell, the doleful Cry
of the Bell-man, and the rumbling of
the Cart Wheels, you may suppose, join'd
together to present to his Mind the most
frightful Ideas, especially Increased by
the Apprehensions that the Plague was
already in his House, and that his own
<HI>Sister</HI> might perhaps be to be fetch'd out
by the Cart and the Bearers the next
Night or two at farthest.</P>
<P>He got up and went to his <HI>Brothers</HI>'s
Chamber, thinking to awaken him, and
to sit down by his Bed-side; but was sur∣priz'd
to find no Body in the Room,
and that the Bed was not unmade; In
short, his <HI>Brother</HI> was up praying with
<PB N="243" REF="254"/>
his <HI>Sister,</HI> and tho' he believed she had
the Plague upon her, yet he would not
leave her, or stir from her, but as Ne∣cessity
oblig'd him; but sat by her, com∣forting
and supporting her Mind, with
the Fruit of their former Experiences,
and reading comforting Scriptures to her;
thus, <HI>I say,</HI> they were spending the Night,
when the Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> calling his <HI>Brother</HI>
by Name, the Servant that attended, told
him, and he went out to him, and their
short and confus'd Discourse, was to this
purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Brother!</HI> we are all dead
Corpses! There's a Cart gone by that
must fetch us all away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is the <HI>Dead Cart,</HI> (so it
was generally call'd) come into our
Lane?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I heard the Bell-man's
dismal Cry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, God's Will be done with
us, let us settle our Minds on him: He
shall not be afraid of evil Tidings whose
Heart is fixed trusting in the Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you go into my
<HI>Sister</HI>'s Chamber, you will get the Distem∣per
to be sure? Nay, have you not got
it already?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell how I may fare
as to that, it shall be as God pleases;
<PB N="244" REF="255"/>
but I will not leave her while she has
Life and Sense in her; She has been my
Soul's Comforter, and I will never cease
Comforting her, as long as I am able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are strangely altered,
and comforted indeed, to what you were,
when you came into the Counting-House
to me, and was for runing away to
<HI>France.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blessed be God, I am altered,
and Blessed be that dear Messenger of
God that is now languishing, and just
entring joyfully into Heaven: She has
been a Thousand times dearer than a
<HI>Sister</HI> to me, she has been an Angel of God
to me: O that I was in her Condition,
as to the Soul, tho' I were in her Condi∣tion
as to the Infection too; as to the last,
that is the particular Hand of God, and
it is our Duty to submit; blessed be God
'tis no Token of his Displeasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! <HI>Brother,</HI> is it no Mark
of God's Displeasure, I think 'tis a sore
and heavy Judgment, and a Token of
God's Vengeance upon the Land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a National Judgment no
doubt, and Calls for National Humilia∣tion;
but I do not think it must always
be call'd a Token of God's Vindictive
Hand to any particular Person; for then
no Body could have any hope of being at
<PB N="245" REF="256"/>
Peace with God that had the Distemper;
and there's our dear <HI>Sister,</HI> bad as she is,
she has a Triumphant Joy possesses her
whole Soul in the Blessed Assurance of
her Salvation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it, but I
am very apt to question those who boast
of their Assurances of Heaven; I think
they very often prove Hypocrites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is too near Heaven to be
a Counterfeit, <HI>Brother;</HI> besides, she is the
humblest most melted Penitent that ever
you heard of; the Sense of God's Pardon∣ing
Mercy has melted her very Soul into
Penitential Tears, and those Tears have
fill'd her with Joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk upon Contraries, you
are all Mysterious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may call it Mysterious if
you will, but 'tis a Blessed Truth, tho'
'tis a mysterious Thing to those that
understand it not: No Repentance, no
Humility, no Tears like those that are
rais'd by an humble Sense of infinite un∣deserved
forgiving Grace: And no Joy,
no Satisfaction of Soul, no Rejoicing,
nay, Triumph of Soul like the Joy that
is founded in Sorrow, founded in Re∣pentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is my <HI>Sister</HI> come that
length? These are sublime Things in∣deed,
<PB N="246" REF="257"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here he stop'd a while, as in some little sudden Confusion, and then went on.</NOTE> O <HI>Brother!</HI> what have I been do∣ing?
I am undone, What shall I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, <HI>Brother,</HI> it has pleas'd
God to Visit the Family; I hope you will
be preserved: I beg of you take Boat and
go immediately on Board the Ship; take
such Servants as you think fit, and your
little Children and go away, for you will
but finish the Ruin of the Family if
you stay, for if you should be struck

<P>Do not ask me, I cannot leave
her; no, I'll live and die with her; I
am sure if I had been the first, she would
not have left me; besides, <HI>Brother,</HI> it may
not be safe for you to have me go, for
to be sure I have the Seeds of the Distem∣per
about me by this time.</P>
<P>He had with much ado prevail'd on his
<HI>Brother,</HI> to resolve upon going the next
Morning, and not to stay for the Ship's
Boat, which was to come for them two
Days after, when offering to go into his
<HI>Sister</HI>'s Chamber again, the Servants met
<PB N="247" REF="258"/>
him softly at the Door, and told him
she was fallen into a Sleep, with a little
Sweat; upon which he retir'd into his own
Chamber again: He waited four or five
Hours, and still his <HI>Sister,</HI> slept most
sweetly, upon which he lay down upon
his own Bed in his Clothes, and slept
several Hours more, and still his <HI>Sister</HI>
was not wak'd.</P>
<P>In a Word, she slept till near Nine a
Clock the next Morning, when she wak'd
wonderfully refresh'd, her Distemper quite
abated, the Fever gone; and in a Word,
it appear'd that she had not the least
Symptoms of the Infection upon her, to
the inexpressible Joy of the whole Fami∣ly.</P>
<P>On the Day appointed the Boat came
up, and the Eldest <HI>Brother</HI> with his two
Children and one Maid-Servant and a
Man-Servant, went on Foot thro' the
Street to <HI>Galley-Key,</HI> where, it being High-water,
the Boat came close to the Shoar
and they went all away.</P>
<P>The next Day, the Boat being order'd
up again, the second <HI>Brother,</HI> the <HI>Sister</HI>
and another Maid-Servant, with an
antient Woman, that was formerly the
<HI>Sister</HI>'s Nurse, went all off in the same
manner.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="259"/>
When they were all safe on Board,
the <HI>Captain</HI> ask'd their leave to bring his
own Wife and one Child, a little Boy
of five Years old, and a Maid to be
with him also, which they all agreed
willingly to; and thus they were all Em∣bark'd
together. This being the first
Week in <HI>August,</HI> by which time the Bu∣rials
in the City and Suburbs amounted
to no less than 4030 in all, of which
of the Plague 2817.</P>
<P>They left the House fasten'd up with
no Soul in it; but left the Care of guard∣ing
it, to the ordinary Watch by Night,
and two poor Men, who by turns kept the
outer Door by day, took in Letters and
any such Business, as in that time of a
Cessation of all Business, might happen;
these were particularly directed to take in
the <HI>Weekly Bill</HI> of Mortality, which, with
all Foreign Letters they order'd to be
sent Weekly to a House at <HI>Greenwich,</HI>
and gave Orders at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to have
them brought to the Ship side, after they
had been Perfum'd and sprinkl'd with
<HI>Vinegar,</HI> and then scorch'd at the Fire, as
was then the Usage.</P>
<P>The Ship, as I observ'd, lay at an
Anchor a little above <HI>Deptford,</HI> where
they continued about a Fortnight longer;
but finding by that time the dreadful
<PB N="249" REF="260"/>
Increase of the Plague, and that it came
on <HI>Eastward</HI> from the other End of the
Town by the <HI>North Side</HI> of the City into
the Parishes of <HI>Aldgate, White Chappel</HI> and
<HI>Stepney,</HI> and particularly began to rage in
<HI>Wapping</HI> and <HI>Ratcliff,</HI> and even down to
<HI>Blackwall;</HI> also, that some had died
of it in <HI>Rotherhith</HI> and in <HI>Deptford,</HI> they
found they should be, as it were, surround∣ed;
so the <HI>Captain</HI> at their Request,
weigh'd and Fell down the River, to a
Place between <HI>Black-Wall</HI> and <HI>Woolwich,</HI>
which they call <HI>Bugby's-Hole,</HI> being a
secure place for Ships to ride in.</P>
<P>The Vessel they were in, was a Ship of
Force, carrying 16 Guns, but could car∣ry
24; so that they liv'd at large and
had room enough; the Merchant and
his Family had the great Cabbin and
Steerage to themselves, with some Cabbins
built on purpose for his Maid-Servants
and Children in the Gun-Room; an
Appartment was built up out of the
great Cabbin for his <HI>Sister,</HI> and her Nurse
and Maid, and himself and his <HI>Brother</HI>
had each of them a large Cabbin built in
the Steerage, so the rest of the great Cab∣bin
was their Dining Room: The <HI>Captain</HI>
had the Round-House and the little Room
before it, which they call the Cuddie, for
his Family, and the Quarter-Deck was
<PB N="250" REF="261"/>
their Parade or walking Place; over which
the <HI>Captain</HI> had caus'd an Auning to be built,
and cover'd it so close, both Top and
Sides, that it was like a great Hall.</P>
<P>They soon found reason also to remove
the Place appointed for their Letters,
and order'd them to <HI>Woolwich,</HI> both the
Towns of <HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich,</HI> being
forely Visited.</P>
<P>Here they Rode with great Satisfaction,
for all the rest of the Month of <HI>August,</HI>
when they receiv'd the last <HI>Weekly Bill</HI>
for the said Month of <HI>August,</HI> which a∣mounted
to no less than 7496, a fright∣ful
Number indeed! and which was still
dreadfully Increasing having Increas'd
almost 2000, that very Week, not
reckoning such as died in the Towns of
<HI>Deptford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>This put the Merchant upon a new
Proposal to the <HI>Captain,</HI> which was to go
quite away to Sea; for he was now in
such a dreadful Consternation on several
Accounts, that he was altogether as un∣easy
as he was before he left his House
in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>While they thus lay in <HI>Bugsby's-Hole,</HI> the
<HI>Captain</HI> and the Merchant's second <HI>Brother,</HI>
with their Boat, had ventur'd down to
<HI>Woolwich,</HI> that is to say, to the uppper
end of the Town, but did not go on
<PB N="251" REF="262"/>
Shore, neither were the People of the
Town at first willing to let them come
on Shore, not knowing whence they
came, or how they far'd on Board, and
they were the more wary, because, be∣sides
the Town of <HI>Greenwich,</HI> the Plague
was raging at <HI>Black-Wall,</HI> also in all that
part of the Country, which contained
several Villages, all in <HI>Stepney</HI> and <HI>Brom∣ley</HI>
Parishes, such as <HI>Black Wall, Poplar,
Lime-House, Bow, Old-Ford, Bethnal-Green,
Bromley, Mile-End;</HI> in the former of which
Parishes (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Stepney,</HI> including <HI>White-Chappel,</HI>
there died 1026 People that very
Week, and the next Week 1327.</P>
<P>However they answer'd their end at
<HI>Woolwich,</HI> which was first to learn that
the Town was not yet Infected, except
two Houses at a little Distance towards
<HI>Greenwich,</HI> where three or four had died;
that the Market was yet pretty well
furnish'd with Provisions; so they got a
good Woman of the Town to buy such
Provisions for them, as they had Occasion
for, such as fresh Butter, some Eggs and
a great Quantity of Garden Stuff, such
as the Season afforded, with Apples in
abundance; all which was a great Relief
to them, having been more tied down
to Salt Meats, than agreed with them,
being so differing from their usual way
<PB N="252" REF="263"/>
of living before; they got also fresh Meat,
as Veal and Pork, and in a Word, were
very well stor'd with refreshments.</P>
<P>But by the next Market Day the
Plague was so far got into the Town,
that the Country People came but very
thin to the Market, by which the quantity
of Provisions was lessened, and not to be
easily had; nor did the Merchant care
to venture the Boat on Shore any more.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Captain</HI> made a little Voyage
in his Boat to <HI>Barking</HI> Creek, intending
to go up the said Creek to <HI>Barking</HI> Market;
but was inform'd by some of the Fisher∣men's
Smaks which lay at the Mouth of
the Creek, that the Plague was there
also; whether true or not, they did not
stay to Inquire, but came back.</P>
<P>When they found this, the Merchant
grew impatient, and in short, would lie
there no longer; so they Weigh'd and
went down the River to a Place call'd
<HI>Green-Hithe;</HI> but there being no Market
there, nor any great Store of Provisions,
and the <HI>Captain</HI> thinking their Riding there
not so safe as lower down, considering
how few Hands they had on Board he
proposed going as low as <HI>Gravesend,</HI> where
if it happen'd to over Blow, they might
get some Men from the Shore.</P>
<P>While they were considering this, they
<PB N="253" REF="264"/>
call'd with a Speaking-Trumpet to the
Shore for a Boat to come on Board, ac∣cordingly
a Boat came off, but they wou'd
not let them come on Board till they
had enquir'd whether the Plague was
in the Town; nor would the Fellows
come on Board till they had enquir'd
whence the Ship come last; but after∣wards
the Men in the Boat assuring them
that the Town was in perfect Health, and
the <HI>Captain</HI> assuring the Town Boat that
they came from <HI>Bugbys-Hole</HI> only, where
they had ridden three Weeks, that they
were all in perfect Health, and came down
lower because they heard that the Plague
was at <HI>Black Wall</HI> and <HI>Woolwich.</HI> I say af∣ter
this they became better acquainted.</P>
<P>Here also they had News that the
Plague was at <HI>Graves-end,</HI> and as the People
said, at <HI>Chatham</HI> and <HI>Rochester,</HI> but it
seems, as they were afterwards inform'd,
that News was not true; only that a
Rumour had spread over the Country
to that purpose, a great while before it
was so; however, this alter'd their Re∣solutions,
and they continued for the
present where they were; tho' this was
no Market Town, yet they got some fresh
Provisions, and particularly sent a Coun∣try
Man with a little Cart and two
Horses to <HI>Dartford,</HI> a Market Town a∣bout
<PB N="254" REF="265"/>
three Miles up the Country, and
which at that time was free from the
Infection; and there they stor'd them∣selves
again fully.</P>
<P>But the Merchant was still uneasy, for
he could not bear to lie any where with
the Ship, if the Plague was at any Town
beyond him; so he made the <HI>Captain</HI> remove
the Ship again and fall down to <HI>Graves-end,</HI>
and passing the Town he came to an
Anchor below a Place, which is since
call'd the <HI>New Tavern,</HI> being as far as
the Custom Officers would let him pass
without clearing.</P>
<P>Here they were told that the Town
of <HI>Gravesend</HI> was perfectly clear of the
Plague, but as they had been told o∣therwise
at <HI>Greenwich,</HI> he would not suf∣fer
the Boat to stir on Shore, or call any
Boat to come off to them, but made shift
with such Provisions as they had.</P>
<P>While they Rode here, they suffer'd a
violent Storm of Wind, in which they
were in some Danger of driving from
their Anchors, and going on Shore;
and tho' there was no doubt of sav∣ing
their Lives, yet it put them in a
very great Fright, least they should be
forc'd from this little Sanctuary (the Ship)
where they had been hitherto so comfort∣ably
shelter'd.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="266"/>
However, as they Rode out the Storm
with safety, and got over the Danger,
the <HI>Captain</HI> told his Merchant seriously,
that he thought it was not safe to Ride
so low with so few Hands; that if he
was willing to let him go on Shore and
get three or four good Seamen, which
he believed might be easily done, he
would then clear the Ship at the Fort, and
fall down into the <HI>Hope,</HI> or go to the
<HI>Buoy</HI> on the <HI>Nore,</HI> where he thought he
might Ride as safe as where they did;
but if not, that then it would be a bet∣ter
way to go up to the upper End of
<HI>Long-Reach</HI> and Ride there, where he be∣liev'd
there lay five or six Ships in the
same Circumstances, and on the same Ac∣count
with themselves.</P>
<P>The Merchant was utterly against go∣ing
on Shore at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> but especially
against taking any more Seamen on
Board; but would have had the <HI>Captain</HI>
have stood away for <HI>Harwich,</HI> but upon
second Thoughts, as it had been said that
the Plague came over first from <HI>Holland;</HI>
so to go to <HI>Harwich,</HI> would be just to go
in the way of it, the Packet-Boats con∣tinuing
to go and come between that
Place and <HI>Holland;</HI> and that they did not
know but that <HI>Harwich</HI> might be Infect∣ed,
<PB N="256" REF="267"/>
and then they were left to the wide
World.</P>
<P>In short they agreed at last to come
up the River again, not to <HI>Green-Hithe,</HI>
where they lay before, but to the up∣per
part of that which they call <HI>Long-Reach,</HI>
which is about three Miles nearer
<HI>London</HI> than <HI>Green-Hithe.</HI> Here they had
very good Riding and safe, though some∣times
blustering Weather: Here lay six
other Vessels, four above them, and two
below them; and tho' they did not go
on Board one another, yet they soon be∣came
acquainted with one another, and
conversed with one another upon the par∣ticular
Circumstances of each Ship, and
the publick State of Things also; and
they found presently, that they were all
Outward Bound Ships, but had not their
Loading fully in, that they were, as it
were, embargo'd by the general Calami∣ty,
that the <HI>Captains</HI> had all their Fa∣milies
on Board, and most of them had
other Families on Board also, and that
they had fallen down there for safety
from the Plague, and it was to their
particular Satisfaction, that they under∣stood
that they were all very Healthy so
far, and that there had not the least Ap∣pearance
of Illness been among them.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="268"/>
They had not lain here above three
Days, but the Head-most Ship, that is to
say, that which say at the upper end of the
<HI>Roach,</HI> made a Signal to the rest, which
this Ship did not understand; he found
that the rest answer'd it, and tho' he was
going to call to the next Ship to know
the meaning of it, when the Head-most
Ship's Boat came off with the Ship's Mate
on Board, and lying upon their Oars,
they Hal'd the <HI>Captain,</HI> who answering,
the Mate, told him his <HI>Captain</HI> order'd
him to acquaint them, that the next Day
was the Day that the Six Ships had ap∣pointed
ever since they Rode there in
Company, to keep as a Weekly Fast on
the present sad Occasion, in order to beg
of God to preserve them from the Pesti∣lence;
and that they should be glad these
would please to join with them in it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Captain</HI> answer'd in the Name of
himself and all that were on Board his
Vessel, that they would join in it with all
their Hearts, and return'd Thanks to
the <HI>Captain</HI> of the first Ship, for com∣municating
it to him, desiring to know
the time they begun and ended: The
Officer in the Boat told them that they
began at eight a Clock, and resolv'd not
to eat or drink till six in the Evening;
accordingly they kept a most religious
<PB N="258" REF="269"/>
Day of Fasting and Humiliation on Board
this Ship; but having no Minister on
Board, they made it an Act of private
Devotion only, except we shall call it
Family Devotion: The <HI>Captain</HI> and his
Family kept themselves retir'd the whole
time within the <HI>Round-House,</HI> &amp;c. And not
one of them was seen all the Day.</P>
<P>Our Family, of which we are particu∣larly
treating, and therefore call them
so, did the like; but the Elder <HI>Brother</HI>
was still so confus'd in his Thoughts, and
had such a reserv'd Melancholly upon
him, all the time, that he could do little
more than read a Sermon or two out of a
Book to his Servants, and then retir'd
himself into his particular Cabbin, where he
spent his Time as well as he could; but as
he afterwards said, very uncomfortably to
himself.</P>
<P>The second <HI>Brother,</HI> and the <HI>Sister</HI> join'd
together in the private Devotion of that
Day, and spent it as they us'd to do
their usual Fasts; namely, in reading
the Scriptures and private Comforting
one another, and endeavouring to give
themselves up to the disposing of God's
good Providence, and in praying with one
another, of which more by and by.</P>
<P>About three Days after this, which was
the 6th of <HI>Sept.</HI> 1665 they receiv'd the
<PB N="259" REF="270"/>
<HI>Weekly Bill</HI> of Mortallity, being from the
29th of <HI>August</HI> to the 5th of <HI>Sept.</HI> in which
the Number of the Dead was 8252, for
one Week only, whereof of the Plague
and Spotted-Fever 7145. This was a
frightful Account, and particularly to
them; because the gross of the Numbers
that died, were in the <HI>Eastern</HI> part of the
City, and in <HI>Southwark</HI> side, where at first
they had been longest without the Infec∣tion;
and in short, that it seem'd to draw
a pace towards them.</P>
<P>This fill'd them all with heaviness, and
as by the help of Speaking-Trumpets, they
now convers'd freely with all the other
Ships, and all those Ships with one another,
The Merchant whose mind was still un∣easy,
caus'd the <HI>Captain</HI> to call with his
Trumpet to the rest of the Ships, and
to desire that the <HI>Captains</HI> of all the Ships
a Head, would come to their <HI>Round-House</HI>
Windows, and that the <HI>Captains</HI> of the
two Ships a Stern would come to the
<HI>Fore-Castle</HI> of their Ships, for he had
something to propose to them, for the
Common good of them all.</P>
<P>Accordingly they came, and the <HI>Cap∣tain,</HI>
in the Name of his chief Owner
who was on Board, “Told them how
dreadfully the Plague was Increased,
and how the Weight of it was all at
<PB N="260" REF="271"/>
the <HI>East</HI> part of the Town, and par∣ticularly,
that the Towns of <HI>Greenwich,
Woolwich, Black-Wall, West-Ham,</HI> and
<HI>Barking,</HI> were all Infected, besides other
Towns on both Sides of them, which
they yet had had no Account of; that
in short they should be surrounded
with it on every Side, and should not
be able to get Provisions on Shore,
without danger of being Infected; and
that since they were all, blessed be God,
in perfect Health at present, and while
they had sufficient Provisions on Board,
his Advice was, that they should join
all together, and by Consent put out to
Sea, and Sail to such other Port in
<HI>England,</HI> or if need were, in <HI>Ireland,</HI>
where they might be furnished with
Provisions and Ride with safety: That
his Merchant assur'd them he would
stand by them and assist them, if they
would agree together to stand by one
another; and that as they were seven
Sall of Ships in Company all of good
Force, they should be able to Force
the People wherever they should come,
to furnish them with Provisions for
their Money, or to go on Shore and
dwell at large, as they found conveni∣ent,
till this terrible Judgment should
be overpast.”</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="272"/>
The <HI>Captains</HI> unanimously agreed, that
it was a very good Proposal, and two
of them gave a full and free Consent
immediately; they two having Authori∣ty
enough in themselves and having none
of their Owners Families on Board, or
that if they had, they heard the Offer
and consented to it: The other <HI>Captains</HI>
answer'd, That they had every one of
them several Families of their Owners,
and Merchants on Board, and they would
consult with them and give their answer.</P>
<P>Accordingly having call'd their said
Owners together; and advised about it,
some of them agreed to it, and others
seem'd rather not to be resolute enough
than to differ from it, the Women be∣ing
afraid of the Sea at that time of the
Year; however their Debates took up a
great deal of Time, so that it was ne∣ver
fully agreed to.</P>
<P>In this Interval the dreadful height
which the Plague was come to, may be
judg'd of in the following Particulars, for
three Weeks only.</P>

Thus that dreadful Affair stood at
that time, and these three dismal Weeks
were worn out in Consultations and
unsteady Resolutions; the poor Ladies
being both afraid to stay, and afraid to
go away: At length, the 29th of <HI>Septem∣ber,
(Michaelmas-day)</HI> they were surpriz'd
in the Morning early, to hear the Head∣most
Ship Fire five Guns, and looking
out, they found she had spread her An∣tient
and Pendants, and all look'd with a
Face of Joy; This being indeed so unusual
at a time of such Distress, they began to
call to one another with their Speaking-Trumpets,
to know what the Occasion
of it was, when they saw a Boat come
off from the Headmost Ship to give them
an account of Things.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Boat came on to every
Ship, and at a Distance, calling to them
one by one, as they row'd by, told them
that their <HI>Captain</HI> had receiv'd the <HI>Bill</HI> of
<HI>Mortallity</HI> for the last Week, and two
Letters, with an Account that the Plague
was abated in an extraordinary Manner,
and that the Number of Burials was De∣creas'd
near 2000.</P>
<P>This was matter of Joy sufficient in∣deed
to them all, and they all fir'd their
Guns, and drank to one anothers Health,
as well as they could at that distance,
<PB N="264" REF="276"/>
and in hopes the Distemper would go
on to abate, they laid aside their Thoughts
of going all to Sea, as they had intend∣ed
to do.</P>
<P>Nor did their hopes of the gradual
A batement of the Distemper disappoint
them, for the next Week after that, the
<HI>Bills</HI> decreased 740, and the next 652, and
the third Week 1849; so that the Num∣bers
of Burials between the 19th of <HI>Sept.</HI>
and the 17th of <HI>Octob.</HI> were decreased
from 8297 to 3219, and from 4 Parishes
being clear of the Plague to 16 Parishes,
and the very next Week after, it decreased
1413 more, and 26 Parishes were entirely
clear of the Infection in the City only.</P>
<P>Any one will conclude, that from this
happy Decrease, they were greatly en∣courag'd,
and indeed they had reason;
for notwithstanding the Care they had
taken, and the happy retir'd Condition
they were in, even as it were separated
from all Mankind, yet it was a very
dismal View they had of what might
happen to be their Lot; for they were
as it was, surrounded with the general
Affliction; not only the City was thus
terribly Visited, but all the Market Towns
and Towns of Note on both sides the
River, and a great way into the Coun∣try
were more or less Infected; as <HI>Rum∣ford,
<PB N="265" REF="277"/>
Barking, Grayes,</HI> and the Villages a∣bout
on the <HI>Essex</HI> Side, and <HI>Greenwich,
Woolwich, Dartford Gravesend,</HI> and the Ci∣ty
of <HI>Rochester,</HI> with the Towns of <HI>Stroud</HI>
and <HI>Chattam,</HI> adjoining on the <HI>Kentish</HI>
Side: So that they had but one Course
to take, which was that which they had
been Consulting upon: Namely, of put∣ting
out to Sea, and going to the North
round <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was, at
best, a long, and considering it was Win∣ter,
a dangerous Voyage.</P>
<P>But now they were in great hopes
of a compleat Deliverance, for every
Week, <HI>as above,</HI> the Plague abated, and
they began to see the Boats pass and re∣pass
as usual, to and from <HI>London;</HI> and
several Vessels loaden with Corn from the
Coast of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> went up to Mar∣ket,
venturing in hopes of a good Price;
as also Coasting Vessels from the Coast
of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> with Butter and Cheese, came
up in considerable Numbers; so that
Trade seem'd to be restor'd, and the
People were not so afraid of one another
as usual.</P>
<P>However, they continued where they
were all of them, and agreed, that they
would not suffer any Boat to come on
Board them from any place whatsoever,
or any of their Company to go on Shore,
<PB N="266" REF="278"/>
or on Board any other Vessel, till they
found things still better: And in this
Cautious manner they liv'd out the whole
Month of <HI>November;</HI> by which time the
Distemper was so far abated in <HI>London,</HI>
that the Burials for the whole Week,
amounted to but 428, whereof of the
Plague but 210; abundance of Parishes
entirely clear of the Plague, and but
24 dead of it in the whole City.</P>
<P>During this happy Decrease of the
Burials, tho' they kept their Resolutions
as to the going up to the City; yet they
went on Shoar with their Boats frequently
to <HI>Purfleet</HI> and to <HI>Greenhith,</HI> and to other
unfrequented Places, to get fresh Provi∣sions;
Butter, Fowls, Eggs, and such like;
also to a little Town call'd <HI>Rainham,</HI>
to which there is a small Creek that their
Boats could go up in, and where they
employ'd a Butcher to Kill some Sheep
on purpose for them; I mean for all the
Ships, and where they got Information
how the Infection was in the Country;
where they found that as it was later
coming among them there, so it was
not so much abated in Proportion in the
Country as in <HI>London;</HI> and this made them
the more Cautious.</P>
<P>Besides, as they were thinking of go∣ing
up to <HI>London,</HI> they were a little al∣larm'd

with what might indeed be rea∣sonably
expected: Namely, That the
People flocking on all hands to <HI>London</HI>
by the Necessity of Business, prospect of
Gain, or other Things, they would come
thither too hastily, and catch the Di∣stemper,
before it was quite gone; and
indeed so it was, for the very first Week
of <HI>November,</HI> when the Plague was De∣creased
to 1031 <HI>per</HI> Week, it Increased a∣gain
400 in one Week; and so again the
first and second Week in <HI>December,</HI> when
it was fallen as above to 210, it Increa∣sed
again, almost a Hundred.</P>
<P>This made them more Cautious, and
whereas before they were for coming up
in the Ships Boats to <HI>London.</HI> Now they
alter'd their Measures, and resolv'd to
Weigh their Anchors and come up in
the Ships as they were, and come for the
first time no farther than to <HI>Deptford Reach,</HI>
where they would continue 'till they
heard how Things went.</P>
<P>Accordingly they Weigh'd from <HI>Long-Reach,</HI>
and having good Weather, came
all together into the lower End, of what
they call now <HI>Limehouse-Reach,</HI> a little a∣bove
<HI>Deptford;</HI> here they came to an An∣chor,
Mooring their Ships two and two,
close a Board one another; whereas they
lay before single and separate one from
<PB N="268" REF="280"/>
another. And now they began to be bet∣ter
acquainted, to Visit one another, and
Congratulate their Deliverance, and be
thankful also, <HI>that I am to suppose,</HI> to their
great Deliverer for their Preservation.</P>
<P>While they continued here, the Fa∣mily
I am speaking of, sent some of their
Servants to Town, to Open and Air the
House, make Fires in the Rooms, Air
and Warm the Beds, dry the Linnen, and
the like; and particularly, the Merchant,
the Elder <HI>Brother,</HI> who had been acquain∣ted
with such Things abroad, caused all
the Hangings in the House to be taken
down, and all, except Tapestry, to be
Burnt; the Younger <HI>Brother,</HI> would have
had them only Bak'd or Wash'd in <HI>Vine∣gar,</HI>
and dried very near the Fire; but
he was positive to have them Burnt, as
what he said might retain an Infectious
Air; tho' they were not sure any such
Air was in the House.</P>
<P>Thus after almost four Months absence,
all things being prepar'd within Doors, and
the whole Parish which their House stood
in, having been several Weeks free from
the Plague, they returned to their Habi∣tation,
Sound and in Health, their Mea∣sures
for Preparation, as well as for Pre∣servation,
being such, as we may justly
recommend to the Pactice of others, if
<PB N="269" REF="281"/>
the like Visitation should come upon us
as we have but too much reason to
fear it may.</P>
<P>But I cannot leave this Subject with∣out
returning to the blessed Couple, the
<HI>Brother</HI> and <HI>Sister,</HI> whose Preparations for
Death are as Remarkable and Exem∣plar,
as the Preparations of the other were
for Life; and which, I hope I may with
more earnestness than ordinary, recom∣mend
for the Practice of all such who are
apprehensive of the same Judgment, and
who desire to be supported with the same
Courage, and upon the same religious
Foundation.</P>
<P>From the time that the Elder <HI>Brother,</HI>
who we call the <HI>Merchant,</HI> accepted the
Offer of the <HI>Captain</HI> of the Ship, they
seem'd to be entirely Passive in the
Matter of removing, or not removing,
leaving it wholly to Providence, and
their <HI>Brother</HI>'s Direction only; indeed
they look'd upon the <HI>Captain</HI>'s unexpect∣ed
Motion for it, to be something like
a Call from Heaven to them, to come out
of the Danger, and therefore when they
found that Particular in it, which was
not related to them at first, they clos'd
willingly with the Offer.</P>
<P>While they were in the Ship, they con∣tinued
their particular Conversations upon
<PB N="270" REF="282"/>
the Subject of Death, and their Fasts twice
a Week as before; tho' they had not so
good Convenience for their Retirement:
They were composedly Chearful, and as
they were fully resign'd, and that upon
a good and solid Foundation, to the
dispositions of Providence; so they left all
the other Things, such as removing from
one Place to another, down the River
and up the River, wholly to the Direc∣tion
of their <HI>Brother</HI> the <HI>Merchant.</HI></P>
<P>This was the sweet and happy Conse∣quence
of a serious Preparation; which I
cannot therefore but earnestly recom∣mend
to every Christian's Consideration,
as that alone which will Compose them
and make them present to themselves in
the greatest Distress, that can be possible
to fall upon them, and in all the Dangers
of a general Infection.</P>
<P>It may on the contrary be observ'd
of the first <HI>Brother,</HI> (tho' a religious
Man too in his Degree) yet that hav∣ing
put off the Evil Day, and endeavour'd
to keep off the Apprehensions of it from
his Mind, he had likewise put off his
Preparations, as well of one sort as of an∣other,
either for Soul or Body; and what
was the Consequence? his Passions, not
his Piety were Agitated when the Hour
came upon him; he was in a continual
<PB N="271" REF="283"/>
hurry of Mind, and in a terrible
Fright, even to Amazement and Dis∣composure:
He thought himself secure
no where, and he made all their Re∣straints
when he was in the Ship, so
much the more severe by his Constant
uneasiness, least the Infection should reach
them. He would not have had the Ship
have lain at <HI>Long-Reach,</HI> because he heard
the Plague was at <HI>Dartford,</HI> tho' the
Town of <HI>Dartford</HI> lay three or four Miles
off in the Country, and up a Creek or Ri∣ver,
which few Boats went up or came
down, and none near to them; for they
lay near a Mile below the Creek: He was
also afraid in the <HI>Hope,</HI> because he heard it
was at <HI>Gravesend,</HI> tho' no Boat came near
them, and he would not let any of the
Men go on Shoar, no not in the Marshes
where there were no Towns, so much as
to Buy Things that they wanted of the
Farmers. His Mind was also full of
Horror, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead the <HI>Bills</HI> of
<HI>Mortallity</HI> his Flesh would tremble, and
he would fall into such Agonies as can
hardly be describ'd: And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus stood the
Difference between the Prepar'd and the
Un-prepar'd, <HI>Let us chuse <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our selves!</HI>
God grant that every sincere Christian
may have his Eyes up to him in all
such Cases, and prepare his Mind by a
<PB N="272" REF="284"/>
sincere Repentance for all their Sins, and
a resolv'd and steddy giving themselves
up to the Divine disposal; then they
shall experience that happy Truth, that
<HI>he shall not be afraid of Evil Tidings, whose
Heart is fixed trusting in the Lord.</HI></P>
