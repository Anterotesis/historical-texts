<P>WHereas there is a <HI>Spurious Collection</HI> of the Writings of Mr. <HI>De Foe,</HI> Author of▪ <HI>The True Born English-Man,</HI> which contains several things not writ by the said Author, and those that were, are full of Errors, Mistakes and Omissions, which in∣verts the Sense and Design of the Author. This is to give Notice, That the <HI>True Col∣lection,</HI> Corrected by himself, with Additi∣ons never before Printed, hath the Author's Picture before it, curiously Engrav'd on Copper by M. <HI>Vandergucht;</HI> and con∣tains more than double the Number of Tracts incerted in the said <HI>Spurious Col∣lection,</HI> Price 6<HI>s.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE World has been pleas'd to Mannage me so severely of late, that if ever I presume to Visit them in Print again, I must at the same time make a tedious Apology, and so descen▪d to what I have always had an Aversion to, I mean the Impertinence of a long Preface.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, that when by a Man's Writing 'tis plain enough what he Means, yet a poor Author should be forc'd to trouble the World with a long Account of what he does not mean too.</P>
<P>I confess, according to the Custom of the Times, he that writes any thing which may be misunderstood <HI>Ought to expect to be Misun∣derstood,</HI> and ought to give People leave to believe he meant ill, tho' the Error is in their own Eye-sight, and the Reason is, because he that knew the Defect of Custom, ought to have fenc'd against it: As when a Man talks softly to a Deaf Man, he ought to expect the Man should think he Curses when he Complements, and that if he Smiles at a Story, he Laughs at him he tells it to, and he cannot flame the Man neither, because he might have spoke plainer.</P>
<P>This is the Case with respect to those Dissenters, who are of the Opinion, That a certain Book, which, <HI>'tis too true for me was of my Writing,</HI> was writ with a Design to have all the Dissenters Hang'd, Banish'd or Destroy'd, and that the Gallows, and the Gal∣lies, should be the Penalty of Going to a Conventicle, forgetting that the same time I must design to have my Father, my Wife, six innocent Children, and my self, put into the same Condition.</P>
<P><PB REF="4"/>
All the Fault I can find in my self as to these People is, that when I had drawn the Picture I did not like the <HI>Dutch</HI>-man, with his Man and Bear write under them, <HI>This is the Man,</HI> and <HI>This is the Bear,</HI> lest the People should mistake me.</P>
<P>I confess I did not foresee an Occasion for this, and having in a Compliment to their Judgments shun'd so sharp a Reflection upon their Senses. I have left them at Liberty, to Treat me like One that put a Value upon their Penetration at the Expence of my own.</P>
<P>I have no Occasion further to mention that unhappy Book than on these Accounts; for, 'tis plain, all other Parties understand it, and take it as it was meant, and I am like to find it so.</P>
<P>The Liberty the World has taken with my Character, in this time of my Retreat, has been the Occasion of this Book.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, that when a Man under the Publick Resentment was oblidg'd to keep out of the way, the whole World should fly at him, like a Dog with a Broom at his Tail, reckon up all the Faults of his Life, and Ten Thousand more than ever he Committed, to be the common Places of their general Discourse, taking the Advan∣tage of his Absence, when he was not able to Answer for him∣self.</P>
<P>Nay, so Extravagant was the whole World, that One had Wit little enough, as well as Manners, to Challenge me in Print, when he knew, at the same time, there was a Reward of Fifty Pounds to be given to him that would Discover where I was.</P>
<P>This was such a Satyr upon all the rest, that really instead of Figh∣ting that Gentleman I would Thank him, if I knew who he was, as a Person that was willing to show himself a Coxcomb, that other People might see their own Pictures.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> is particularly famous for the most Generous way of Figh∣ting in the World, I mean as to the common Peoples private Quar∣rels, while the <HI>Dutch</HI> mangle one another with Knives, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Highlanders knock one another's Brains out with Pole-Axes, the <HI>Irish</HI> stab with their Skeins, and <HI>Spaniards</HI> with their Daggers; the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>-men fairly Box it out, and in this way of Fighting the Rabble stands by to see fair Play, as they call it, which is, that when a
<PB REF="5"/>
Man is down 'tis Counted foul Play, and the Trick of a Coward, to strike him, but let him Rise, and then have-at-him.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it had been but kind to have given me fair play, and not fall all upon me when I was down; let me get up again, <HI>if I can, for I much doubt it,</HI> and then let us see whose Face is blackest, and welcome.</P>
<P>In this Universal humour of Mobbing me, some Gentlemen have descended very much beneath their own Characters, as well as Ho∣nesty, to the Disgrace of Good Manners, and the scandal of their Edu∣cation. If I was not really very angry with them, I should give them some room in this Book, but I scorn to make a Satyr the Method of showing my private Resentment.</P>
<P>If I would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resent all the scoundrel Usage I have met with, and some of it from my Friends, I must certainly prepair <HI>to dye with my Shooes on,</HI> and therefore I choose to let it pass, as that which is really more shame to the Author of Scandal than to me.</P>
<P>But that the World may see I am not one of those that Practice what I reprove, I began this Satyr, with Owing, in my self, those Sins and Misfortunes which I am no more exempted from than other Men, and as I am far from pretending to be free from Humane frail∣ties, but forwarder to confess any of the Errors of my Life, than any Man can be to Accuse me. I think my self in a better way to Re∣formation, than those who excuse their own Faults by reckoning up Mine.</P>
<P>Some that have heard me complain of this hard usage have told me, there is something of a Retaliation of Providence in it, for my being so very free with the Characters of other Men, in a late Satyr call'd, <HI>The Reformation of Manners.</HI></P>
<P>To this I Answer,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> in that Satyr, or any other I ever wrote, I have always carefully avoided lashing any Man's private Infirmities, as being too sensible of my Own. But if I have singl'd out any Men by Characters, it has either been such as pretending to reform others, and Execute the Laws against Vice, have been the great Examples and Encouragers of it in their own Example and Practice.</P>
<P><PB REF="6"/>
Or such as have been Trusted with the Executive Power of Justice, and having been call'd upon by the Laws to Reform us, have been a publick reproach to the Magistracy of this Nation, and ought to be punish'd by the Laws they have been Protected by.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I have never made any Man's Disasters and Misfortunes the Subject of my Satyr.</P>
<P>I never Reproach'd any Man for having his House burnt, or his Ships cast away, or his Family ruin'd; I never Lampoon'd a Man because he could not pay his Debts, or for his being a Cuckold.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I never Reproach'd any Man for his Opinion in Religion, or us'd him the worse for differing in Judgment from me.</P>
<P>Indeed, if I meet with a profess'd Atheist, that after God has gi∣ven him Life and a Being, denies to own the Being of Him that made him. If I meet with a Clergy-man that points the way to Heaven to other People, but tells them 'tis not worth while for him to go that way himself, a Fellow that Preaches because he's paid for it, and bids his Hearers <HI>get them to Heaven and be Damn'd to 'em,</HI> in such Cases I think I have no Bounds set me.</P>
<P>If therefore the scandalous Treatment I have receiv'd is just upon me for abusing others, I must ask such, Who is the Man? Where is the Character I have given that is not Just? And where's the Re∣taliation of Providence that these Men entitle themselves to in load∣ing me with Falsities and Lies, as a just Punishment for my saying the Truth?</P>
<P>But a PO-x on him, <HI>said a certain sober Gentleman, that did not use to have such Words in his Mouth,</HI> he is a <HI>Whig,</HI> and what need he have meddl'd with his own Party? Could not he have left them out, there were Characters enough o' tother side.</P>
<P>Why really, Gentlemen, I must own I know to Whig or Tory in Vice. The Vitious and the Vertuons are the only two Parties I had to do with. If a Vitious, Leud, Debauch'd Magistrate happen'd to be a Whig, what then? Let him mend his Manners, and he may be a Whig still, and if not, the rest ought to be asham'd of him.</P>
<P>Besides, if they will have me be of that Party, I think I ought rather to have fix't on my own Party than not, <HI>First,</HI> That no Man might say I was Partial and Unfair, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That those I had
<PB REF="7"/>
most kindness for might reform first, which is the best thing I could wish for them.</P>
<P>Well, Gentlemen, if these are my Faults, <HI>you have paid me home for them;</HI> and now 'tis my turn again, but I shall treat you with some different Candor from what I receiv'd.</P>
<P>I do own that I shall never see a notorious scandalous Magistrate, a whoreing drunken Clergy-man, a leud debauch'd Justice of the Peace, a publick blasphemeing Atheist, but I shall be apt to have a fling at him my way; but you have done me this good, that I shall always be a publick Penitent for my own Miscarriages, if it be only in meer Pride not to be liable to your Recrimination.</P>
<P>And I recommend my Practice to all my Friends, if they would be Satyr free,</P>
<LG>
<L>Confession will anticipate Reproach,</L>
<L>He that Reviles us then Reviles too much.</L>
<L>All Satyr ceases when the Men Repent,</L>
<L>'Tis Cruelty to lash the Penitent.</L>
</LG>
<P>And yet, Gentlemen, I desire not to be mistaken, for as I will never hide my Infirmities, so I am not oblidg'd to confess Sins I never committed; and therefore speaking to the Vitious, with whom I have been so free, I must say, I was not in their debt this Acknow∣ledgement; for tho' I have been a Man of Misfortunes, and one of the greatest has been to be wrong fully accus'd, yet I have the comfort of this Negative, if Negative Vertues can be any Comfort, That I have not been a Man of Vice, and whatever Malice may have the ill Nature to suggest, I venture to say without Pride, no Man can charge me with it.</P>
<P>I forbear to say any thing farther than Thankfulness to restraining Goodness extorts, for I count a Man no proper Advocate for himself. But if I must act the', Pharisee a little, I must begin thus; <HI>God, I thank thee,</HI> I am not a Drunkard, or a Swearer, or a Whore-master, or a busy Body, or Idle, or Revengeful, &amp;c. and tho' this be true, and I chal∣lenge all the World to prove the contrary, yet I must own I see small satisfaction in all the possible Negatives of Common Vertue. For tho' I
<PB REF="8" MS="y"/>
have not been Guilty of any of these Vices, nor of many more, I have nothing to infer from thence, but, <HI>Te Deum Laudamus.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, how can it be true that I have been too free with the Characters, when here are a sort of People almost ready to go to∣gether by the Ears about the Characters; if there be a Drunken Ju∣stice, all Men are fond of being thought the Man, the Lawyers have named me Twenty Men for my <HI>Clitus,</HI> and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>undance more for <HI>Fletumacy,</HI> and if I have singl'd out but one of a Sort, where is the Injury to any Body? since if they who are nam'd don't like it, bere is so many People are fond of taking it up in their stead.</P>
<P>However, it seems to be a Disparagement to the Satyr to want so direct a Hint at the Person nam'd, as if the Character was not a sufficient D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scription of the Party, and this argued a Deficency of Wit in the performance.</P>
<P>In order therefore, to please every Body, if that impossible thing be likely, I have plac'd the few Characters in this Book without any true References, declaring before hand, that the Letters signifie no Body, and the Consequences of this are two.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If any Person has reason to think he is the Man pointed out in any Particular, he is at Liberty to disown the Character, and by his future Reformation to show that it could not be he.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Those that are fond of a rank Character, need not fall out who was meant by the Author; but as many as find their Likeness in the Picture may call it their own, and fill up the Blanks with their Names if they please.</P>
<P>They who expect I should say any thing of my own Matters relating to <HI>The shortest Way,</HI> will be mistaken, this is no part of the Design, nor hath the Book any thing to do with it. So far as that Book has Displeas'd the Government, I have surrendred at Discretion, and having voluntarily committed my self to the Publick Clemency, have no more to say but this, <HI>It is the Queen, let Her Majesty do what seems Good in Her Eyes.</HI></P>

<LG>
<L>HE that in Satyr dips his angry Pen,</L>
<L>To lash the Manners, and the Crimes of Men;</L>
<L>Pretends to bring their Vices on the Stage,</L>
<L>And draw the proper Picture of the Age:</L>
<L>If he be Mortal, if he be a Man,</L>
<L>They'l make a Devil of him if they can.</L>
<L>The meanest slip shall in a Glass be shown,</L>
<L>That by his Faults they may excuse their own:</L>
<L>So guided by their Passions, Pride, or Fate,</L>
<L>That they who should reform, recriminate:</L>
<L>And he that first reforms a vicious Town,</L>
<L>Prevents their ruin, but completes his own;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
For if he was an Angel from on high,</L>
<L>He cannot 'scape the general Infamy:</L>
<L>They who resolve, they never will amend,</L>
<L>Assault him first, their Vices to defend;</L>
<L>And when his Lines may happen to convince,</L>
<L>They miss the Passions, tho' they touch the Sense.</L>
<L>By secret Pride, of which we all partake,</L>
<L>We'll hate the Doctrine for the Teacher's sake:</L>
<L>Scorn the Instruction, or, with high Disdain,</L>
<L>Tho' we receive the hint, abuse the Man;</L>
<L>As School Boys, when Corrected for a Fault,</L>
<L>Like what they learn, but hate the Man that taught.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ill Nature is conspicuous enough</L>
<L>In Mankind's strong aversion to Reproof,</L>
<L>In which their Passions contradict their Sence,</L>
<L>While Shame and Pride shut out their Penitence.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For Pride's the Native regent of the Mind,</L>
<L>And where it rules, it ruins all Mankind;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
He that pretends to storm it, may as well</L>
<L>Assault the very Counterscarp of Hell:</L>
<L>Ten Thousand lesser Devils stand within,</L>
<L>To garrison their Frontier Town of Sin:</L>
<L>Whom e're this swelling Vapour does possess,</L>
<L>It never fails their Reason to suppress;</L>
<L>To struggle with it, is a vain pretence,</L>
<L>It masters all the Manners and the Sence;</L>
<L>But above all things, 'tis distinctly shown,</L>
<L>In that our least Mistakes we scorn to own:</L>
<L>Go on in Vice, because we hate to mend,</L>
<L>And won't acknowledge what we can't defend:</L>
<L>And if the sawcy Priests, or Poets, dare</L>
<L>To Lash the fashionable Vice we wear;</L>
<L>Nay, tho' their Language should convince th' Age▪</L>

<L>Shame, Pride's young Sister, and her self a Vice.</L>

She talks of Honour, Scandal of the Times,</L>
<L>Blushes at Reformation, not at Crimes.</L>
<L>Men must be vicious, when they have begun,</L>
<L>The scandal of Acknowledgment to shun;</L>
<L>They must go on in Vice, because they're in,</L>
<L>Asham'd t'repent, but not asham'd to sin:</L>
<L>These Mens destruction no Man can prevent,</L>
<L>For Modesty has made them impudent.</L>
<L>The Difficulty in this Riddle lies;</L>
<L>The Virtue shou'd reform them is their Vice.</L>
<L>No proper Language can describe the case,</L>
<L>Too little Honesty, and too much Grace:</L>
<L>Cowards, whom Nature too much Courage lent▪</L>
<L>Who dare to sin, but dare not to repent:</L>
<L>Fools, who unhappily are curst with Wit,</L>
<L>And know not how to Own what they commit.</L>

<LG>
<L>These Arguments the latent Cause contain,</L>
<L>Why Mankind are so oft reprov'd in vain▪</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
Their Modesty's the new uncommon Evil,</L>
<L>'Tis bad to sin, but to repent's the Devil.</L>
<L>He that offends, may ha' been Vice's Tool,</L>
<L>But to acknowledge, makes a Man a Fool;</L>
<L>Puts him quite out of Fashion in the Town,</L>
<L>And he that <HI>Once</HI> reforms, is <HI>Twice undone.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Satyr, while Men upon such Maxims move,</L>
<L>Expect no quarter, if thou wilt reprove;</L>
<L>If e're unhappily thou step'st awry,</L>
<L>Thy general Virtue's all condemn'd to die:</L>
<L>With a full Cry they'l join to hunt thee down,</L>

<L>Then first examin with a careful Hand,</L>
<L>And search the Ancient Statutes of the Land,</L>

<LG>
<L>If Innocence alone must Guilt remove,</L>
<L>Where lives the Man that's fitted to reprove?</L>

<L>If in our Circle such a Star should shine,</L>

<L>But since Mankind are all alike so frail,</L>

<L>He that has all his own Mistakes confest,</L>

<L>And will be Censur'd for a Fool by none,</L>
<L>But they who see no Errors of their own:</L>

For Innocence in Men, can not be meant</L>
<L>Of such as ne're offend, but as repent;</L>
<L>Therefore of them that Vices reprehend,</L>
<L>Tis not requir'd, that they should ne'er offend:</L>
<L>But this they always owe to Gods and Men,</L>
<L>Not to commit the Vices they Condemn;</L>
<L>Nor to be quite subdu'd by general Crimes,</L>
<L>Not first Debauch, and then Reform the Times.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Satyr is Nonsense, when it comes from those</L>
<L>Who practise all the Errors they expose;</L>
<L>This is reforming of the World by halves,</L>
<L>And all the Satyr points upon themselves;</L>
<L>Directly tells us, their own Names are meant,</L>

<L>Thy Satyr must upon thy self begin.</L>

<LG>
<L>Malice shall write thy Character in vain,</L>
<L>Thou know'st more Faults than thy Describers can;</L>
<L>But let the Man that pens thy History</L>

<L>He's welcome then his Satyr to advance,</L>
<L>And gorge his rising Spleen with thy Mischance:</L>
<L>'Tis vain, against thy Crimes to raise a Storm,</L>
<L>Let those recriminate who first reform:</L>
<L>Let them expose thy Errors to the Town,</L>

<L>If ever yet thou did'st pretend to be</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay, if it should be thy severer Fate,</L>
<L>That those thou hast reprov'd recriminate;</L>
