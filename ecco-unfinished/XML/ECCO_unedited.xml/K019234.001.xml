<HEAD>AN
ACCOUNT
OF THE
LIFE and WRITINGS
OF
Mr. JAMES THOMSON.</HEAD>
<P>IT is commonly said, that the life of a good writer
is best read in his works; which can scarce fail to
receive a peculiar tincture from his temper, manners,
and habits: the distinguishing character of his mind,
his ruling passion, at least, will there appear undisgui∣sed.
But however just this observation may be; and
although we might safely rest Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s fame, as
a good man, as well as a man of genius, on this sole
footing; yet the desire which the public always shews
of being more particularly acquainted with the history
of an eminent author, ought not to be disappointed;
as it proceeds not from mere curiosity, but chiefly
from affection and gratitude to those by whom they
have been entertained and instructed.</P>
<P>To give some account of a deceased friend is often
a piece of justice likewise, which ought not to be re∣fused
to his memory: to prevent or efface the imper∣tinent
fictions which officious biographers are so apt to
collect and propagate. And we may add, that the
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
circumstances of an author's life will sometimes throw
the best light upon his writings; instances whereof we
shall meet with in the following pages.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> was born at <HI>Ednam,</HI> in the shire of
<HI>Roxburgh,</HI> on the 11th of <HI>September,</HI> in the year 1700.
His father, minister of that place, was but little known
beyond the narrow circle of his co-presbyters, and to
a few gentlemen in the neighbourhood; but highly re∣spected
by them for his piety, and his diligence in the
pastoral duty; as appeared afterwards in their kind of∣fices
to his widow and orphan family.</P>
<P>The Reverend Mess. <HI>Riccarton</HI> and <HI>Gusthart</HI> par∣ticularly,
took a most affectionate and friendly part
in all their concerns. The former, a man of uncom∣mon
penetration and good taste, had very early disco∣vered,
through the rudeness of young <HI>Thomson</HI>'s pue∣rile
essays, a fund of genius well deserving culture
and encouragement. He undertook therefore, with
the father's aprobation, the chief direction of his stu∣dies,
furnished him with the proper books, corrected
his performances, and was daily rewarded with the
pleasure of seeing his labour so happily employed.</P>
<P>The other reverend gentleman, Mr. <HI>Gusthart,</HI> who
is still living, one of the ministers of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
senior of the Chapel Royal, was no less serviceable to
Mrs. <HI>Thomson</HI> in the mangement of her little affairs;
which, after the decease of her husband, burdened as
she was with a family of nine children, required the
prudent counsels and assistance of that faithful and ge∣nerous
friend.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Bennet</HI> likewise, well known for his gay
humour and ready poetical wit, was highly delighted
with our young poet, and used to invite him to pass the
summer-vacation at his country-seat; a scene of life
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
which Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> always remembered with particu∣lar
pleasure. But what he wrote during that time, ei∣ther
to entertain Sir <HI>William</HI> and Mr. <HI>Riccarton,</HI> or for
his own amusement, he destroyed every new-year's
day; committing his little pieces to the flames in their
due order; and crowning the solemnity with a copy
of verses, in which were humourously recited the se∣veral
grounds of their condemnation.</P>
<P>After the usual course of school education, under an
able master at <HI>Jedburgh,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> was sent to the
university of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> But in the second year of
his admission, his studies were for some time interrupted
by the death of his father; who was carried of so sud∣denly,
that it was not possible for Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> with
all the diligence he could use, to receive his last bles∣sing.
This affected him to an uncommon degree; and
his relations still remember some extraordinary instan∣ces
of his grief and filial duty on that occasion.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Thomson,</HI> whose maiden name was <HI>Hume,</HI> and
who was co-heiress of a small estate in the country, did
not sink under this misfortune. She consulted her
friend Mr. <HI>Gusthart;</HI> and having, by his advice, mort∣gaged
her moiety of the farm, repaired with her family
to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> where she lived in a decent frugal man∣ner,
till her favourite son had not only finished his aca∣demical
course, but was even distinguished and patro∣nized
as a man of genius. She was, herself, a person
of uncommon natural endowments; possessed of every
social and domestic virtue; with an imagination, for
vivacity and warmth, scarce inferior to her son's, and
which raised her devotional exercises to a pitch border∣ing
on enthusiasm.</P>
<P>But whatever advantage Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> might derive
from the complexion of his parent, it is certain he
<PB N="iv" REF="6"/>
owed much to a religious education: and that his early
acquaintance with the sacred writings contributed
greatly to that <HI>sublime,</HI> by which his works will be for
ever distinguished. In his first pieces the <HI>Seasons,</HI> we
see him at once assume the majestic freedom of an
Eastern writer; seizing the grand images as they rise,
clothing them in his own expressive language, and pre∣serving,
throughout, the grace, the variety, and the
dignity which belong to a just composition; unhurt
by the stiffness of formal method.</P>
<P>About this time, the study of poetry was become
general in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the best <HI>English</HI> authors being
universally read, and imitations of them attempted.
<HI>Addison</HI> had lately displayed the beauties of <HI>Milton</HI>'s
immortal work; and his remarks on it, together with
Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>'s celebrated <HI>Essay,</HI> had opened the way to an
acquaintance with the best poets and critics.</P>
<P>But the most learned critic is not always the best
judge of poetry; taste being a gift of nature, the
want of which, <HI>Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Bossu</HI> cannot supply; nor
even a study of the best originals, when the reader's
faculties are not <HI>tuned in a certain consonance</HI> to those
of the poet: and this happened to be the case with
certain learned gentlemen, into whose hands a few of
Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s first essays had fallen. Some inaccura∣cies
of style, and those luxuriances which a young wri∣ter
can hardly avoid, lay open to their cavils and cen∣sure;
so far indeed they might be competent judges:
but the fire and enthusiasm of the poet had entirely
escaped their notice. Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> however, consci∣ous
of his own strength, was not discouraged by this
treatment; especially as he had some friends on whose
judgment he could better rely, and who thought very
differently of his perfomances. Only, from that time,
<PB N="v" REF="7"/>
he began to turn his views towards <HI>London;</HI> where
works of genius may always expect a candid recep∣tion
and due encouragement; and an accident soon
after entirely determined him to try his fortune there.</P>
<P>The divinity-chair at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was then filled by
the reverend and learned Mr. <HI>Hamilton;</HI> a gentleman
universally respected and beloved; and who had par∣ticularly
endeared himself to the young divines under
his care, by his kind offices, his candour and affability.
Our author had attended his lectures for about a year,
when there was prescribed to him for the subject of
an exercise, a Psalm, in which the power and majesty
of God are celebrated. Of this psalm he gave a pa∣raphrase
and illustration, as the nature of the exercise
required; but in a style so highly poetical as surprised
the whole audience. Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> as his custom was,
complimented the orator upon his performance, and
pointed out to the students the most masterly striking
parts of it; but at last, turning to Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> he
told him, smiling, that if he thought of being useful in
the ministry, he must keep a stricter rein upon his ima∣gination,
and express himself in language more intelli∣gible
to an ordinary congregation.</P>
<P>This gave Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> to understand, that his ex∣pectations
from the study of theology might be very
precarious; even though the church had been more
his free choice than probably it was. So that having,
soon after, received some encouragement from a lady
of quality, a friend of his mother's, then in <HI>London,</HI> he
quickly prepared himself for his journey. And al∣though
this encouragement ended in nothing benefi∣cial,
it served for the present, as a good pretext to co∣ver
the imprudence of committing himself to the wide
<PB N="vi" REF="8"/>
world, un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riended and unpatronised, and with the
slender stock of money he was then possessed of.</P>
<P>But his merit did not long lye concealed. Mr. <HI>For∣bes,</HI>
afterwards Lord President of the Session, then at∣tending
the service of parliament, having seen a speci∣men
of Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s poetry in <HI>Scotland,</HI> received him
very kindly, and recommended him to some of his
friends; particularly to Mr. <HI>Aikman,</HI> who lived in great
intimacy with many persons of distinguished rank and
worth. This gentleman, from a connoisseur in paint∣ing,
was become a professed painter; and his taste be∣ing
no less just and delicate in the kindred art of des∣criptive
poetry, than in his own, no wonder that he
soon conceived a friendship for our author. What a
warm return he met with, and how Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> was
affected by his friend's premature death, appears in the
copy of verses which he wrote on that occasion.</P>
<P>In the mean time, our author's reception, where∣ever
he was introduced, emboldened him to risk the
publication of his <HI>Winter;</HI> in which, as himself was a
mere novice in such matters, he was kindly assisted by
Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> then private tutor to his Grace the Duke of
<HI>Montrose,</HI> and his brother the Lord <HI>George Graham,</HI>
so well known afterwards as an able and gallant sea∣officer.
To Mr. <HI>Mallet</HI> he likewise owed his first ac∣quaintance
with several of the wits of that time; an
exact information of their characters, personal and
poetical, and how they stood affected to each other.</P>
<P>The poem of <HI>Winter,</HI> published in <HI>March</HI> 1726, was
no sooner read than univer;sally admired: those only
excepted who had not been used to feel, or to look for
any thing in poetry, beyond a <HI>point</HI> of satirical or epi∣grammatic
wit, a smart <HI>antithesis</HI> richly trimmed with
rhyme, or the softness of an <HI>elegiac</HI> complaint. To
<PB N="vii" REF="9"/>
such his manly classical spirit could not readily com∣mend
itself; till, after a more attentive perusal, they
had got the better of their prejudices, and either ac∣quired
or affected a truer taste. A few others stood
aloof, merely because they had long before fixed the
articles of their poetical creed, and resigned themselves
to an absolute despair of ever seeing any thing new and
original. These were somewhat mortified to find their
notions disturbed by the appearance of a poet, who
seemed to owe nothing but to nature and his own ge∣nius.
But, in a short time, the applause became una∣nimous;
every one wondering how so many pictures,
and pictures so familiar, should have moved them but
faintly to what they felt in his descriptions. His di∣gressions
too, the overflowings of a tender benevolent
heart, charmed the reader no less; leaving him in
doubt, whether he should more admire the <HI>Poet,</HI> or
love the <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>From that time Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s acquaintance was
courted by all men of taste; and several ladies of high
rank and distinction became his declared patronesses
the Countess of <HI>Hertford,</HI> Miss <HI>Drelincourt,</HI> afterwards
Viscountess <HI>Primrose,</HI> Mrs. <HI>Stanley,</HI> and others. But
the chief happiness which his <HI>Winter</HI> procured him
was, that it brought him acquainted with Dr. <HI>Rundle,</HI>
afterwards Lord Bishop of <HI>Derry:</HI> who, upon conver∣sing
with Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> and finding in him qualities
greater still, and of more value, than those of a poet,
received him into his intimate confidence and friend∣ship;
promoted his character every where; introdu∣ced
him to his great friend the Lord Chancellor <HI>Tal∣bot;</HI>
and, some years after, when the eldest son of
that nobleman was to make his tour of travelling, re∣commended
Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> as a proper companion for
<PB N="viii" REF="10"/>
him. His affection and gratitude to Dr. <HI>Rundle,</HI> and
his indignation at the treatment that worthy prelate
had met with, are finely expressed in his poem to the
memory of Lord <HI>Talbot.</HI> The true cause of that un∣deserved
treatment has been secreted from the public,
as well as the dark <HI>manoeuvres</HI> that were employed:
but Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> who had access to the best informa∣tion,
places it to the account of
<Q><P>—Slanderous zeal, and politics infirm,
Jealous of worth.—</P></Q></P>
<P>Mean-while, our poet's chief care had been, in return
for the public favour, to finish the plan which their
wishes laid out for him; and the expectations which his
<HI>Winter</HI> had raised, were fully satisfied by the successive
publications of the other <HI>Seasons:</HI> of <HI>Summer,</HI> in the
year 1727; of <HI>Spring,</HI> in the beginning of the follow∣ing
year; and of <HI>Autumn,</HI> in a quarto edition of his
works, printed in 1730.</P>
<P>In that edition, the <HI>Seasons</HI> are placed in their natu∣ral
order; and crowned with that inimitable <HI>Hymn,</HI>
in which we view them in their beautiful succession, as
<HI>one whole,</HI> the <HI>immediate</HI> effect of infinite <HI>Power</HI> and
<HI>Goodness.</HI> In imitation of the Hebrew bard, all nature
is called forth to do homage to the Creator, and the
reader is left enraptured in silent adoration and praise.</P>
<P>Besides these, and his tragedy of <HI>Sophonisba,</HI> writ∣ten,
and acted with applause, in the year 1729, Mr.
<HI>Thomson</HI> had, in 1727, published his poem to the Me∣mory
of Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> then lately deceased; con∣taining
a deserved encomium of that incomparable
man, with an account of his chief discoveries; sublime∣ly
poetical; and yet so just, that an ingenious foreigner,
the Count <HI>Algarotti,</HI> takes a line of it for the text of
his philosophical dialogues, <HI>Il Neutonianismo per le
<PB N="ix" REF="11"/>
dame:</HI> this was in part owing to the assistance he had
of his friend Mr. <HI>Grey,</HI> a gentleman well versed in the
<HI>Newtonian philosophy,</HI> who, on that occasion, gave him
a very exact, though general, abstract of its principles.</P>
<P>That same year, the resentment of our merchants,
for the interruption of their trade by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in
<HI>America,</HI> running very high, Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> zealously
took part in it; and wrote his poem <HI>Britannia,</HI> to
rouse the nation to revenge. And although this piece
is the less read that its subject was but accidental and
temporary; the spirited generous sentiments that en∣rich
it, can never be out of season; they will at least
remain a monument of that love of his country, that
<HI>devotion to the public,</HI> which he is ever inculcating as
the perfection of virtue, and which none ever felt
more pure, or more intense, than himself.</P>
<P>Our author's poetical studies were now to be inter∣rupted,
or rather improved, by his attendance on the
Honourable Mr. <HI>Charles Talbot</HI> in his travels. A de∣lightful
task indeed! endowed as that young nobleman
was by nature, and accomplished by the care and ex∣ample
of the best of fathers, in whatever could adorn
humanity: graceful of person, elegant in manners and
address, pious, humane, generous; with an exquisite
taste in all the finer arts.</P>
<P>With this amiable companion and friend. Mr. <HI>Thom∣son</HI>
visited most of the courts and capital cities of <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
and returned with his views greatly enlarged;
not of exterior nature only, and the works of art, but
of human life and manners, of the constitution and po∣licy
of the several states, their connexions, and their
religious institutions. How particular and judicious
his observations were, we see in his poem of <HI>Liberty,</HI>
begun soon after his return to <HI>England.</HI> We see, at
<PB N="x" REF="12"/>
the same time, to what a high pitch his love of his
country was raised, by the comparisons he had all along
been making of our happy well-poised government
with those of other nations. To inspire his fellow-sub∣jects
with the like sentiments; and to shew them by
what means the precious freedom we enjoy may be
preserved, and how it may be abused or lost; he em∣ployed
two years of his life in composing that noble
work: upon which, conscious of the importance and
dignity of the subject, he valued himself more than
upon all his other writings.</P>
<P>While Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> was writing the first: part of <HI>Li∣berty,</HI>
he received a severe shock, by the death of his
noble friend and fellow-traveller: which was soon fol∣lowed
by another that was severer still, and of more
general concern; the death of Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> himself;
which Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> so pathetically and so justly laments
in the poem dedicated to his memory. In him, the na∣tion
saw itself deprived of an uncorrupted patriot, the
faithful guardian of their rights, on whose wisdom and
integrity they had founded their hopes of relief from
many tedious vexations? and Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> besides his
share in the general mourning, had to bear all the af∣fliction
which a heart like his could feel, for the person
whom, of all mankind, he most revered and loved. At
the same time, he found himself from an easy compe∣tency,
reduced to a state of precarious dependence, in
which he passed the remainder of his life; excepting
only the two last years of it, during which he enjoyed
the place of Surveyor-General of the <HI>Leeward Islands,</HI>
procured for him by the generous friendship of my
Lord <HI>Lyttleton.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately upon his return to <HI>England</HI> with Mr.
<HI>Talbot,</HI> the Chancellor had made him his secretary of
<PB N="xi" REF="13"/>
<HI>Briefs;</HI> a place of little attendance, suiting his retired
indolent way of life, and equal to all his wants. This
place fell with his patron; and although the noble
Lord who succeeded to Lord <HI>Talbot</HI> in office, kept it
vacant for some time, probably till Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> should
apply for it, he was so dispirited, and so listless to
every concern of that kind, that he never took one
step in the affair: a neglect which his best friends
greatly blamed in him.</P>
<P>Yet could not his genius be depressed, or his temper
hurt, by this reverse of fortune. He resumed, with
time, his usual chearfulness, and never abated one ar∣ticle
in his way of living; which, though simple, was
genial and elegant. The profits arising from his works
were not inconsiderable; his tragedy of <HI>Agamemnon,</HI>
acted in 1738, yielded a good sum; Mr. <HI>Millar</HI> was al∣ways
at hand, to answer, or even to prevent, his de∣mands;
and he had a sriend or two besides, whose
hearts, he knew, were not contracted by the ample
fortunes they had acquired; who would, of them∣selves,
interpose, if they saw any occasion for it.</P>
<P>But his chief dependence, during this long interval,
was on the protection and bounty of his <HI>Royal Highness</HI>
FREDERIC Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> who, upon the recom∣mendation
of Lord <HI>Lyttleton,</HI> then his chief favourite,
settled on him a handsome allowance. And after∣wards,
when he was introduced to his Royal Highness,
that excellent prince, who truly was what Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>
paints him, <HI>the friend of mankind, and of merit,</HI> recei∣ved
him very graciously, and ever after honoured him
with many marks of particular favour and confidence.
A circumstance, which does equal honour to the patron
and the poet, ought not hers to be omitted; that my
Lord <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s recommendation came altogether un∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olicited,
<PB N="xii" REF="14"/>
and long before Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> was personally
known to him.</P>
<P>It happened, however, that the favour of his Royal
Highness was in one instance of some prejudice to our
author; in the refusal of a licence for his tragedy of
<HI>Edward</HI> and <HI>Eleonora,</HI> which he had prepared for the
stage in the year 1739. The reader may see that this
play contains not a line which could justly give offence;
but the ministry, still sore from certain pasquinades,
which had lately produced the stage act; and as little
satisfied with, some parts of the Prince's political con∣duct,
as he was with their management of the public
affairs; would not risk. the representation of a piece
written under his eye, and, they might probably think,
by his command.</P>
<P>Thss refusal drew after it another; and in a way
which, as it is related, was rather ludicrous. Mr. <HI>Pa∣terson,</HI>
a companion of Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> afterwards his <HI>de∣puty,</HI>
and then his <HI>successor</HI> in the general surveyorship,
used to write out fair copies for his friend, when such
were wanted for the press or for the stage. This
gentleman likewise courted the tragic muse; and had
taken for his subject, the story of <HI>Arminius</HI> the <HI>German</HI>
hero. But his play, guiltless as it was, being presented
for a licence, no sooner had the <HI>censor</HI> cast his eyes on
the hand-writing in which he had seen <HI>Edward</HI> and
<HI>Eleonora,</HI> than he cried out, Away with it! and the
author's profits were reduced to what his bookseller
could afford for a tragedy in distress.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s next performance was his <HI>Masque</HI>
of <HI>Alfred;</HI> written, jointly with Mr. <HI>Mallet,</HI> by com∣mand
of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> for the entertainment
of his Royal Highness's court, at his summer residence.
This piece, with some alterations, and the music new,
<PB N="xiii" REF="15"/>
has been since brought upon the stage by Mr. <HI>Mallet:</HI>
but the edition we give is from the <HI>original,</HI> as it was
acted at <HI>Clifden,</HI> in the year 1740, on the birth day of
her Royal Highness the Princess <HI>Augusta.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1745, his <HI>Tancred</HI> and <HI>Sigismunda,</HI> taken
from the novel in <HI>Gil Blas,</HI> was performed with ap∣plause;
and, from the deep romantic distress of the lo∣vers,
continues to draw crouded houses. The success
of this piece was indeed insured from the first, by Mr.
<HI>Garrick</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Cibber,</HI> their appearing in the princi∣pal
characters, which they heighten and adorn with all
the magic of their never-failing art.</P>
<P>He had, in the mean-time, been finishing his <HI>Castle
of Indolence,</HI> in two <HI>cantos.</HI> It was, at first, little more
than a few detached stanzas, in the way of raillery on
himself, and on some of his sriends, who would re∣proach
him with indolence; while he thought them, at
least, as indolent as himself. But he saw very soon,
that the subject deserved to be treated more seriously,
and in a form fitted to convey one of the most impor∣tant
moral lessons.</P>
<P>The <HI>stanza</HI> which he uses in this work is that of
<HI>Spenser,</HI> borrowed from the <HI>Italian</HI> poets; in which he
thought rhymes had their proper place, and were even
graceful: the compass of the stanza admitting an agree∣able
variety of final sounds; while the sense of the
poet is not cramped or cut short, nor yet too much di∣lated;
as must often happen, when it is parcelled out
into rhymed couplets; the usual measure, indeed, of
our <HI>elegy</HI> and <HI>satire;</HI> but which always weakens the
higher poetry, and, to a true ear, will sometimes give
it an air of the <HI>burlesque.</HI></P>
<P>This was the last piece Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> himself publish∣ed;
his tragedy of <HI>Cariolanus</HI> being only prepared for
<PB N="xiv" REF="16"/>
the theatre, when a fatal accident robbed the world of
one of the best men, and best poets, that lived in it.</P>
<P>He had always been a timorous horseman; and
more so, in a road where numbers of giddy or unskilful
riders are continually passing; so that when the wea∣ther
did not invite him to go by water, he would com∣monly
walk the distance between <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI>
with any acquaintance that offered; with whom he
might chat and rest himself, or perhaps dine, by the
way. One summer-evening, being alone, in his walk
from town to <HI>Hammer-smith,</HI> he had overheated himself,
and in that condition imprudently took a boat to carry
him to <HI>Kew;</HI> apprehending no bad consequence from
the chill air on the river, which his walk to his house,
at the Upper end of <HI>Kew-lane,</HI> had always hitherto
prevented. But, now, the cold had so seized him,
that next day he found himself in a high fever, so
much the more to be dreaded that he was of a full
habit. This, however, by the use of proper medi∣cines,
was removed, so that he was thought to be out
of danger: till the fine weather having tempted him to
expose himself once more to the evening dews, his
fever returned with violence, and with such symptoms
as left no hopes of a cure. Two days had passed be∣fore
his relapse was known in town; at last Mr. <HI>Mitchell</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Reid,</HI> with Dr. <HI>Armstrong,</HI> being informed of
it, posted out at midnight to his assistance: but, alas!
came only to endure a sight of all others the most
shocking to nature, the last agonies of their beloved
friend. This lamented death happened on the 27th day
of <HI>August,</HI> 1748.</P>
<P>His testamentary executors were, the Lord <HI>Lyttle∣ton,</HI>
whose care of our poet's fortune and same ceased
not with his life; and Mr. <HI>Mitchell,</HI> a gentleman equally
<PB N="xv" REF="17"/>
noted for the truth and constancy of his private friend∣ships,
and for his address and spirit as a public mi∣nister.
By their united interest, the Orphan play of
<HI>Coriolanus</HI> was brought on the stage to the best advan∣tage:
from the profits of which, and the sale of ma∣nuscripts,
and other effects, all demands were duly
satisfied, and a handsome sum remitted to his sisters.
My Lord <HI>Lyttleton</HI>'s prologue to this piece was admi∣red
as one of the best that had ever been <HI>written:</HI> the
best <HI>spoken</HI> it certainly was. The sympathizing audi∣ence
saw that, <HI>then</HI> indeed, Mr. <HI>Quin</HI> was no <HI>actor;</HI>
that the tears he shed, were those of real friendship
and grief.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s remains were deposited in the church
of <HI>Richmond,</HI> under a plain stone, without any inscrip∣tion;
nor did his brother-poets at all exert themselves
on the occasion, as they had lately done for one who
had been the terror of poets all his life-time. This
silence furnished matter to one of his friends for an ex∣cellent
satirical epigram, which we are sorry we can∣not
give the reader. Only one gentleman, Mr. <HI>Collins,</HI>
who had lived some time at <HI>Richmond,</HI> but forsook it
when Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> died, wrote an ode to his memory.
This, for the dirge-like melancholy it breathes, and the
warmth of affection that seems to have dictated it, we
shall subjoin to the present account.</P>
<P>Our author himself hints, somewhere in his works,
that his exterior, was not the most promising; his make
being rather robust than graceful; though it is known
that in his youth he had been thought handsome.
His worst appearance was, when you saw him walking
alone, in a thoughtful mood: but let a friend accost
him, and enter into conversation, he would instantly
brighten into a most amiable aspect, his features no
<PB N="xvi" REF="18"/>
longer the same, and his eye darting a peculiar animated
fire. The case was much alike in company; where, if
it was mixed, or very numerous, he made but an in∣different
figure: but with a few select friends, he was
open, sprightly, and entertaining. His wit flowed free∣ly,
but pertinently, and at due intervals, leaving room
for every one to contribute his share. Such was his
extreme sensibility, so perfect the harmony of his or∣gans
with the sentiments of his mind, that his looks
always announced, and half expressed, what he was
about to say; and his voice corresponded exactly to the
manner and degree in which he was affected. This
sensibility had one inconvenience attending it, that it
rendered him the very worst reader of good poetry: a
<HI>sonnet,</HI> or a copy of tame verses, he could manage
pretty well, or even improve them in the reading; but
a passage of <HI>Virgil, Milton</HI> or <HI>Shakespear,</HI> would some∣times
quite oppress him, that you could hear little else
than some ill-articulated sounds, rising as from the bot∣tom
of his breast.</P>
<P>He had improved his taste upon the best originals,
ancient and modern; but could not bear to write what
was not strictly his own, what had not more immedi∣ately
struck his imagination, or touched his heart: so
that he is not in the least concerned in that question
about the <HI>merit</HI> or <HI>demerit</HI> of <HI>imitators.</HI> What he bor∣rows
from the ancients, he gives us in avowed faith∣ful
paraphrase or translation; as we see in a few pas∣sages
taken from <HI>Virgil,</HI> and in that beautiful picture
from <HI>Pliny</HI> the eloer, where the course and gradual
encrease of the <HI>Nile</HI> are figured by the stages of man's
life.</P>
<P>The autumn was his favourite season for poetical
composition, and the deep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the night, the time
<PB N="xvii" REF="19"/>
he commonly chose for such studies; so that he would
often be heard walking in his library till near morning,
humming over, in his way, what he was to correct and
write out next day.</P>
<P>The amusements of his leisure hours were civil and
natural history, voyages, and the relations of travel∣lers,
the most authentic he could procure: and had
his situation favoured it, he would certainly have ex∣celled
in gardening, agriculture, and every rural im∣provement
and exercise. Although he performed on
no instrument, he was passionately fond of music, and
would sometimes listen a full hour at his window to
the nightingales in <HI>Richmond</HI> gardens. While abroad,
he had been greatly delighted with the regular <HI>Italian</HI>
drama, such as <HI>Metastasio</HI> writes; as it is there heigh∣tened
by the charms of the best voices and instruments;
and looked upon our theatrical entertainments as, in
one respect, naked and imperfect, when compared with
the <HI>ancient,</HI> or with those of <HI>Italy;</HI> wishing sometimes
that a <HI>chorus,</HI> at least, and a better <HI>recitative,</HI> could be
introduced.</P>
<P>Nor was his taste less exquisite in the arts of <HI>paint∣ing,
sculpture,</HI> and <HI>architecture.</HI> In his travels, he had
seen all the most celebrated monuments of antiquity,
and the best productions of modern art: and studied
them so minutely, and with so true a judgment, that in
some of his descriptions, in the poem of <HI>Liberty,</HI> we
have the master-pieces there mentioned placed in a
stronger light perhaps than if we saw them with our
eyes; at least more justly delineated than in any other
account extant: so superior is a natural taste of the
<HI>grand</HI> and <HI>beautiful,</HI> to the traditional lessons of a com∣mon
<HI>virtuoso.</HI> His collection of prints, and some draw∣ings
<PB N="xviii" REF="20"/>
from the antique, are now in the possession of his
friend, Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Richmond-hill.</HI></P>
<P>As for his more distinguishing qualities of <HI>mind</HI> and
<HI>heart,</HI> they are better represented in his writings, than
they can be by the pen of any biographer. There,
his love of mankind, of his country and friends; his
devotion to the <HI>Supreme Being,</HI> founded on the most
elevated and just conceptions of his operations and pro∣vidence,
shine out in every page. So unbounded was
his tenderness of heart, that it took in even the brute
creation: judge what it must have been towards his
own species. He is not indeed known, through his
whole life, to have given any person one moment's pain,
by his writings or otherwise. He took no part in the
poetical squabbles which happened in his time; and
was respected and left undisturbed by both sides. He
would even refuse to take offence when he justly mighty;
by interrupting any personal story that was brought him,
with some jest, or some humorous apology for the
offender. Nor was he ever seen ruffled or discomposed,
but when he read or heard of some flagrant instance of
injustice, oppression or cruelty: then, indeed, the
strongest marks of horror and indignation were visible
in his countenance.</P>
<P>These amiable virtues, this divine temper of mind,
did not fail of their due reward. His friends loved him
with an enthusiastic ardor, and lamented his untimely
fate in the manner that is still fresh in every one's me∣mory:
the best and greatest men of his time honoured
him with their friendship and protection; the applause
of the public atended every appearance he made; the
actors, of whom the more eminent were his friends
and admirers, grudging no pains to do justice to his
tragedies. At present, indeed, if we except <HI>Tancred,</HI>
<PB N="xix" REF="21"/>
they are seldom called for; the simplicity of his plots,
and the models he worked after, not suiting the reigning
taste, nor the impatience of an <HI>English</HI> theatre. They
may hereafter come to be in vogue; but we hazard no
comment or conjecture upon them, or upon any part of
Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s works; neither need they any defence or
apology, after the reception they have had at home,
and in foreign languages into which they have been
translated. We shall only say, that, to judge from the
imitations of his <HI>manner,</HI> which have been following him
close, from the very first publication of <HI>Winter,</HI> he
seems to have fixed no inconsiderable aera of the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
poetry.</P>

<HEAD>Anecdote of Mr. QUIN, the celebra∣ted
PLAYER, and Mr. THOMSON,
AUTHOR of the SEASONS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. <HI>Quin</HI> was a gentleman whose wit and humour
gave life to the conversation of thousands, and
this anecdote reflects so much honour to his memory,
and even to human nature; being so full of generosity
and true benevolence, that not to make it as publick
and as lasting as the SEASONS, would be a kind of
silent Robbery.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> a Scots gentleman, now universally
known by his fine poems on the SEASONS, &amp;c. when
he first came to <HI>London</HI> was in very narrow circum∣stances,
and before he was distinguished by his wri∣tings,
was many times put to his shifts for a dinner.
<PB N="xx" REF="22"/>
The debts he then contracted, lay very heavy upon
him for a long time afterwards; and upon the publi∣cation
of his SEASONS, one of his creditors arrested him,
thinking that a proper opportunity to get his money.
The report of this misfortune, reached the ears of Mr.
<HI>Quin,</HI> who had indeed read the SEASONS, but had ne∣ver
seen their author; and upon stricter enquiry, he
was told that <HI>Thomson</HI> was in the bailiff's hands at a
spunging-house in <HI>Holbourn:</HI> thither <HI>Quin</HI> went, and
being admitted into his chamber, <HI>Sir,</HI> said he, in his
usual tone of voice, <HI>You don't know me I believe, but my
name is Quin.</HI>—Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI> received him very
politely, and said, <HI>that though he could not boast of the
honour of a personal acquaintance, he was no stranger either
to his name or his merit;</HI> and very obligingly invited him
to sit down. <HI>Quin</HI> then told him, he was come to sup
with him, and that he had already ordered the cook to
provide supper, which he hoped he would excuse.—Mr.
<HI>Thomson</HI> made the proper reply, and then the dis∣course
turned indifferently upon subjects of literature.
When supper was over, and the glass had gone briskly
about, Mr. <HI>Quin,</HI> then took occasion to explain himself
by saying, <HI>It was now time to enter upon business.</HI> Mr.
<HI>Thomson</HI> declared he was ready to serve him as far as his
capacity would reach, in any thing he should command,
(thinking he was come about some affair relating to the
Drama.) <HI>Sir,</HI> says Mr. <HI>Quin, you mistake my meaning.
I am in your debt. I owe you one hundred pounds, and I
am now come to pay you.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomson,</HI> with a discon∣solate
air, reply'd, that as he was a gentleman, whom,
to his knowledge, he had never offended, he wondered
he should seek an opportunity to reproach him under
his misfortunes. No, by G—d, said <HI>Quin,</HI> raising
his voice, I'd rather be d—n'd than insult the distressed.
<PB N="xxi" REF="23"/>
<HI>I say, I owe you one hundred pounds, and there it is</HI> (lay∣ing
a bank-note of that value before him.) Mr.
<HI>Thomson</HI> was astonish'd and begged he would explain
himself. <HI>Why,</HI> says <HI>Quin, I'll tell you; the excessive
pleasure I enjoyed in reading your</HI> SEASONS, <HI>con∣strained
me to become your debtor for one hundred pounds;
therefore when I made my</HI> WILL, <HI>among the rest of
my legacies I set down to the author of the</HI> SEASONS <HI>one
hundred pounds; and this day hearing that you was in
this house, I thought I might as well have the pleasure of
paying the money myself, as to leave the payment of it to
my executors, as probably that would be at a time when
you did not so much need it; and this Mr.</HI> THOMSON <HI>is
the business I came about.</HI> It is impossible to describe
Mr. <HI>Thomson</HI>'s grateful acknowledgments, but must leave
every reader to conceive his exquisite sensations at so
much unexpected GENEROSITY.</P>

<HEAD>The following Extract concerning this
Author—taken from the elegant Mr.
W—R T—N'S Essay on the Genius and
Writings of POPE,—wherein he
proves our THOMSON to be the DE∣SCRIPTIVE
POET OF NATURE,—is
inserted here for the Entertain∣ment
of those who have not had the
Happiness of reading that excellent
Performance.</HEAD>
<P>IT would be unpardonable (says Mr. <HI>W—rt—n</HI>)
to conclude these remarks on descriptive poesy,
without taking notice of the SEASONS of <HI>Thomson,</HI> who
had peculiar and powerful talents for this species of
composition. Let the reader therefore pardon a digressi∣on,
if such it be, on his merits and character.</P>
<P><HI>Thomson</HI> was blessed with a strong and copious fancy;
he hath enriched poetry with a variety of new and ori∣ginal
images, which he painted from nature itself, and
from his own actual observations: his descriptions have
therefore a distinctness and truth, which are utterly
wanting to those of poets who have only copied from
each other, and have never looked abroad on the ob∣jects
themselves. <HI>Thomson</HI> was accustomed to wander
away into the country for days and for weeks, attentive
to, “each rural sight, each rural sound;” while many
a poet who has dwelt for years in the <HI>Strand,</HI> has at∣tempted
to describe fields and rivers, and generally suc∣ceeded
accordingly. Hence that nauseous repetition of
the same circumstances; hence that disgusting impro∣priety
<PB N="xxiii" REF="25"/>
of introducing what may be called a set of he∣reditary
images, without proper regard to the age, or
climate, or occasion, in which they were formerly used.
Though the diction of the SEASONS is sometimes harsh
and inharmonious, and sometimes turgid and obscure;
and though in many instances, the numbers are not
sufficiently diversisied by different pauses, yet is this
poem on the whole, from the numberless strokes of na∣ture
in which it abounds, one of the most captivating
and amusing in our language, and which, as its beauties
are not of a fugacious kind, as depending on particular
customs and manners, will ever be perused with delight.
The scenes of <HI>Thomson</HI> are frequently as wild and ro∣mantic
as those of Salvator Rosa, pleasingly varied with
precipices and torrents, and “castied cliffs,” and deep
vallies, with piny mountains, and the gloomiest caverns.
Innumerable are the little circumstances in his descrip∣tions,
totally unobserved by all his predecessors. What
poet hath ever taken notice of the leaf, that towards
the end of autumn,
<Q><L>Incessant rustles from the mournful grove, Ver. 1000</L>
<L>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> startling such as, studious walk below,</L>
<L>And slowly circles through the waving air?</L></Q>
Or, who, in speaking of a summer evening hath ever
mentioned,
<Q>The quail that clamours for his running mate?</Q>
Or the following natural image at the same time of
the y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar?
<Q><L>Wide o'er the thistly lawn, as swells the breeze,</L>
<L>A whitening shower of vegetable down</L>
<L>Amusive floats. Ver. 1645.</L></Q>
<PB N="xxiv" REF="26"/>
In what other poet, do we find the silence and expecta∣tion
that precedes an <HI>April</HI> shower insisted on, as in ver.
165 of SPRING? Or where,
<Q><L>The stealing shower is scarce to patter heard,</L>
<L>By such as wander through the forest walks,</L>
<L>Beneath th' umbrageous multitude of leaves. Ver. 176</L></Q>
How full, particular and picturesque is this assemblage
of circumstances that attend a very keen frost in a
night of winter!
<Q><L>Loud rings the frozen earth, and hard reflects</L>
<L>A double noise; while at his evening watch</L>
<L>The village dog deters the nightly thief;</L>
<L>The heifer lows; the distant water-fall</L>
<L>Swells in the breeze; and with the hasty tread</L>
<L>Of traveller, the hollow-sounding plain</L>
<L>Shakes from afar. Winter, Ver. 735.</L></Q>
In no one subject are common writers more confused
and unmeaning, than in their descriptions of rivers
which are generally said only to wind and to murmur,
while their qualities and courses are seldom accurately
marked. Examine the exactness of the cnsuing de∣scription,
and consider what a perfect idea it communi∣cates
to the mind.

He adds, that the ox in the middle of them,
<Q><L>—From his sides</L>
<L>The troublous insects lashes, to his sides</L>
<L>Returning still. Summer, Ver. 485. et seq.</L></Q>
A natural circumstance, that to the best of my re∣membrance
hath escaped even the natural Theocritus.
Nor do I recollect that any poet hath been struck with
the murmurs of the numberless insects, that swarm abroad
at the noon of a summer's day; as attendants of the
evening indeed, they have been mentioned;

<L>To him who muses through the woods at noon;</L>
<L>Or drowsy shepherd as he lies reclin'd</L>
<L>With half-shut eyes.—Ibid. Ver. 299.</L></Q>
But the novelty and nature we admire in the descriptions
of <HI>Thomson,</HI> are by no means his only excellencies; he is
equally to be praised, for impressing on our minds the
effects, which the scene delineated would have on the
present spectator or hearer. Thus having spoken of the

<PB N="xxvi" REF="30"/>
of Morocco, is so terrified and astonished at the dreadful
uproar, that
<Q>The wretch half wishes for his bonds again.</Q>
Thus also having described a caravan lost and over∣whelmed
in one of those whirlwinds that so frequently
agitate and lift up the whole sands of the desart, he
finishes his pictures by adding that,
<Q><L>—In Cairo's crouded streets, Summer, Ver. 966.</L>
<L>Th' impatient merchant, wandering waits in vain,</L>
<L>And Mecca saddens at the long delay.</L></Q>
And thu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lastly, in describing the pestilence that de∣stroyed
the British troops at the siege of Carthagena, he
has used a circumstance inimitably lively, picturesque,
and striking to the imagination; for he says that the ad∣miral
not only heard the groans of the sick that echoed
from ship to ship, but that he also pensively stood, and
listened at midnight to the dashing of the waters, occa∣sioned
by throwing the dead bodies into the sea;
<Q><L>Heard, nightly, plung'd into the sullen waves,</L>
<L>The frequent corse. Ver. 1035.</L></Q>
A minute and particular enumeration of circumstances
judiciously selected, is what chiefly discriminates poetry
from history, and renders the former, for that reason,
a more close and faithful representation of nature than
the latter. And if our poets would accustom themselves
to contemplate fully every object, before they attempted
to describe it, they would not sail of giving their readers
more new images than they generally do.</P>
<P>THESE observations on <HI>Thomson,</HI> which however
would not have been so large, if there had been already
<PB N="xxvii" REF="31"/>
any considerable criticism on his character, might be still
augmented by an examination and developement of the
beauties in the Loves of the birds in SPRING, verse
580. A view of the torrid zone in SUMMER, verse
626. The rise of fountains and rivers in AUTUMN,
verse 781. A man perishing in the snows in WINTER,
verse 277. The wolves descending from the Alps, and
a view of winter within the polar circle, verse 809,
which are all of them highly-finished originals, excepting
a few of those blemishes intimated above. WINTER is
in my apprehension the most valuable of these four
poems; the scenes of it, like those of Il Pensoroso of
<HI>Milton,</HI> being of that awful, solemn, and pensive kind
on which a great genius best delights to dwell.</P>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The subject proposed. Inscribed to the Countess of
<HI>HARTFORD.</HI> The season is described as it affects
the various parts of Nature, ascending from the
lower to the higher; with digressions arising from
the subject. Its insluence on inanimate matter, on
vegetables, on brute animals, and last on man;
concluding with a dissuasive from the wild and ir∣regulur
passion of love, opposed to that of a pure
and happy kind.</Q>

<PB REF="42"/>
<HEAD>SPRING.</HEAD>
<L>COME, gentle SPRING, ethereal Mildness, come,</L>
<L>And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud,</L>
<L>While music wakes around, veil'd in a shower</L>
<L>Of sh;adowing roses, on our plains descend.</L>
<L>O HARTFORD, fitted or to shine in courts<MILESTONE N="5"/></L>
<L>With unaffected grace, or walk the plain</L>
<L>With innocence and meditation join'd</L>
<L>In soft assemblage, listen to my song,</L>
<L>Which thy own season paints; when Nature all</L>
<L>Is blooming and benevolent, like thee.<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>And see where surly WINTER passes off,</L>
<L>Far to the north, and calls his ruffian blasts:</L>
<L>His blasts obey, and quit the howling hill,</L>
<L>The shatter'd forest, and the ravag'd vale;</L>
<L>While softer gales succeed, at whose kind touch,<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost,</L>
<L>The mountains lift their green heads to the sky.</L>
<L>As yet the trembling year is unconfirm'd,</L>
<L>And WINTER oft at eve resumes the breeze,</L>
<L>Chills the pale morn, and bids his driving sleets<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Deform the day delightless; so that scarce</L>
<L>The bittern knows his time, with hill ingulpht</L>
<L>To shake the sounding marsh; or from the shore</L>
<L>The plovers when to scatter o'er the heath,</L>
<L>And sing their wild notes to the listening waste.<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>At last from <HI>Aries</HI> rolls the bounteous Sun,</L>
<L>And the bright <HI>Bull</HI> receives him. Then no more</L>
<L>Th' expensive atmosphere is cramp'd with cold;</L>

Lifts the light clouds sublime, and spreads them thin,<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Fleecy and white, o'er all-surrounding heaven.</L>
<L>Forth fly the tepid airs; and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Unbinding earth, the moving softness strays.</L>
<L>Joyous, th' impatient husbandman perceives</L>
<L>Relenting Nature, and his lusty steers<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Drives from their stalls, to where the well-us'd plough</L>
<L>Lyes in the furrow, loosened from the frost.</L>
<L>There, unrefusing, to the harness'd yoke</L>
<L>They lend their shoulder, and begin their toil,</L>
<L>Chear'd by the simple song and soaring lark.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Meanwhile incumbent o'er the shining share</L>
<L>The master leans, removes th' obstructing clay,</L>

<L>White thro' the neighbouring fields the sower stalks,</L>
<L>With measur'd step; and liberal throws the grain<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>Into the faithful bosom of the ground:</L>

<L>Be gracious, HEAVEN! for now laborious man</L>

<L>Ye softening dews, ye tender showers, descend!<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>And temper all, thou world-reviving Sun,</L>

<L>Such themes as these the <HI>rural</HI> MARO sung<MILESTONE N="55"/></L>
<L>To wide-imperial ROME, in the full height</L>
<L>Of elegance and taste, by GREECE refin'd.</L>
<L>In ancient times, the sacred plough employ'd</L>
<L>The kings, and awful fathers of mankind:</L>
<L>And some, with whom compar'd your insect-tribes<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>Are but the beings of a summer's day,</L>
<L>Have held the scale of empire, rul'd the storm</L>

Disdaining little delicacies, seiz'd</L>
<L>The plough, and greatly independent liv'd.<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>Ye generous BRITONS, venerate the plough;</L>
<L>And o'er your hills, and long withdrawing vales,</L>
<L>Let Autumn spread her treasures to the sun,</L>
<L>Luxuriant and unbounded: as the sea,</L>
<L>Far through his azure turbulent domain,<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Your empire owns, and from a thousand shores</L>
<L>Wafts all the pomp of life into your ports;</L>
<L>So with superior boon may your rich soil,</L>
<L>Exuberant, Nature's better blessings pour</L>
<L>O'er every land, the naked nations clothe,<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>And be the exhaustless granary of a world!</L>
<L>Nor only thro' the lenient air this change,</L>
<L>Delicious, breathes; the penetrative sun,</L>
<L>His force, deep-darting to the dark retreat</L>
<L>Of vegetation, sets the streaming <HI>Power</HI><MILESTONE N="80"/></L>

<L>Thou smiling Nature's universal robe!</L>
<L>United light and shade; where the sight dwells</L>
<L>With growing strength, and ever-new delight!<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>From the moist meadow to the withered hill,</L>
<L>Led by the breeze, the vivid verdure runs,</L>

<L>The hawthorn whitens; and the juicy groves</L>
<L>Put sorth their buds, unfolding by degrees,<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>Till the whole leafy forest stands display'd,</L>
<L>In full luxuriance, to the sighing gales;</L>
<L>Where the deer rustle through the twining brake,</L>
<L>And the birds sing conceal'd. At once, array'd</L>
<L>In all the colours of the flushing year,<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>By Nature's swift and secret working hand,</L>
<L>The garden glows, and fills the liberal air</L>
<L><PB N="42" REF="45"/>
With lavish fragrance; while the promis'd fruit</L>
<L>Lies yet a little embryo, unperceiv'd,</L>
<L>Within its crimson folds. Now from the town<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>Buried in smoke, and sleep, and noisome damps,</L>
<L>Oft let me wander o'er the dewy fields,</L>
<L>Where freshness breathes, and dash the trembling drops</L>
<L>From the bent bush, as through the verdant maze</L>
<L>Of sweet-brier hedges I pursue my walk;<MILESTONE N="105"/></L>
<L>Or taste the smell of dairy? or ascend</L>
<L>Some eminence, AUGUSTA, in thy plains,</L>
<L>And see the country far diffus'd around,</L>
<L>One boundless blush, one white-empurpled shower</L>
<L>Of mingled blossoms; where the raptur'd eye<MILESTONE N="110"/></L>
<L>Hurries from joy to joy, and, hid beneath</L>
<L>The fair profusion, yellow Autumn spies:</L>
<L>If, brush'd from <HI>Russian</HI> wilds, a cutting gale</L>
<L>Rise not, and scatter from his humid wings</L>
<L>The clammy mildew; or, dry-blowing, breathe<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>Untimely frost; before whose baleful blast</L>
<L>The full-blown Spring thro' all her soilage shrinks,</L>
<L>Joyless and dead, a wide dejected waste.</L>
<L>For oft engender'd by the hazy North,</L>
<L>Myriads on myriads, insect armies warp<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>Keen in the poison'd breeze; and wasteful eat,</L>
<L>Thro' buds and bark, into the blacken'd core,</L>
<L>Their eager way. A feeble race! yet oft</L>
<L>The sacred sons of vengeance; on whose course</L>
<L>Corrosive famine waits, and kills the year.<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>To check this plague the skillful farmer, chaff,</L>
<L>And blazing straw, before his orchard burns;</L>
<L>Till, all involved in smoak, the latent foe</L>
<L>From every cranny suffocated falls:</L>
<L>Or scatters o'er the blooms the pungent dust</L>
<L>Of pepper, fatal to the frosty tribe:<MILESTONE N="130"/></L>
<L><PB N="43" REF="46"/>
Or, when th' invenom'd leaf begins to curl,</L>
<L>With sprinkled water drowns them in their nest;</L>
<L>Nor, while they peck them up with busy bill,</L>
<L>The little trooping birds unwisely scares.<MILESTONE N="135"/></L>
<L>Be patient, swains; these cruel-seeming winds</L>
<L>Blow not in vain. Far hence they keep repress'd</L>
<L>Those deep'ning clouds on clouds, surcharg'd with-rain,</L>
<L>That o'er the vast <HI>Atlantic</HI> hither borne,</L>
<L>In endless train, would quench the summer blaze,<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L>And, chearless, drown the crude unripened year.</L>
<L>The North-east spends his rage; he now shut up</L>
<L>Within his iron cave, th' effusive South</L>
<L>Warms the wide air, and o'er the void of heaven</L>
<L>Breathes the big clouds with vernal showers distent.</L>
<L>At first a dusky wreath they seem to rise,<MILESTONE N="146"/></L>
<L>Scarce staining aether; but by swift degrees,</L>
<L>In heaps on heaps, the doubling vapour sails</L>
<L>Along the loaded sky, and mingling deep,</L>
<L>Sits on th' horizon round a settled gloom:<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L>Not such as wintry storms on mortals shed,</L>
<L>Oppressing life; but lovely, gentle, kind,</L>
<L>And full of every hope and every joy,</L>
<L>The wish of Nature. Gradual sinks the breeze</L>
<L>Into a perfect calm; that not a breath<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Is heard to quiver through the closing woods,</L>
<L>Or rustling turn the many-twinkling leaves</L>
<L>Of aspin tall. Th' uncurling floods, diffus'd</L>
<L>In glassy breadth, seem, thro' delusive lapse,</L>
<L>Forgetful of their course. 'Tis silence all,<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>And pleasing expectation. Herds and flocks</L>
<L>Drop the dry sprig, and, mute imploring, eye</L>
<L>The falling verdure. Hush'd in short suspense,</L>
<L>The plumy people streak their wings with oil,</L>
<L>To throw the lucid moisture trickling off;<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L><PB N="44" REF="47"/>
And wait th' approaching sign to strike, at once,</L>
<L>Into the general choir. Even mountains, vales</L>
<L>And forests seem, impatient, to demand</L>
<L>The promis'd sweetness. Man superior walks</L>
<L>Amid the glad creation, musing praise,<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>And looking lively gratitude. At last,</L>
<L>The clouds consign their treasures to the fields;</L>
<L>And, softly shaking on the dimpled pool</L>
<L>Prelusive drops, let all their moisture flow,</L>
<L>In large effusion, o'er the fresh'ned world.<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>The stealing shower is scarce to patter heard,</L>
<L>By such as wander through the forest walks,</L>
<L>Beneath th' umbrageous multitude of leaves.</L>
<L>But who can hold the shade while Heaven descends</L>
<L>In universal bounty, shedding herbs,<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>And fruits, and flowers, on Nature's ample lap!</L>
<L>Swift fancy fir'd anticipates their growth;</L>
<L>And, while the milky nutriment distils,</L>
<L>Beholds the kindling country colour round.</L>
<L>Thus all day long the full-distended clouds<MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>Indulge their genial stores, and well-shower'd earth</L>
<L>Is deep enrich'd with vegetable life;</L>
<L>Till, in the western sky, the downward sun</L>

<L>Of broken clouds, gay-shifting to his beam.<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>The rapid radiance instantaneous strikes</L>
<L>Th' illumin'd mountain, through the forest streams,</L>
<L>Shakes on the floods, and in a yellow mist,</L>
<L>Far smoaking o'er th' interminable plain;</L>
<L>In twinkling myriads lights the dewy gems,<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L>Moist, bright, and green, the landscape laughs around;</L>
<L>Full swell the woods; their every music wakes,</L>

And hollow lows responsive from the vales,<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>Whence blending all the sweetned zephyr springs.</L>
<L>Mean time, refracted from yon eastern cloud,</L>
<L>Bestriding earth, the grand aethereal bow</L>
<L>Shoots up immense; and every hue unfolds,</L>
<L>In fair proportion running from the red,<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>To where the violet fades into the sky.</L>
<L>Here, awful NEWTON! the dissolving clouds</L>
<L>Form, fronting on the sun, thy showery prism;</L>
<L>And to the sage instructed eye unfold</L>
<L>The various twine of light, by thee disclos'd<MILESTONE N="210"/></L>

<L>To catch the falling glory; but amaz'd</L>
<L>Beholds th' amusive arch before him fly,<MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>Then vanish quite away. Still night succeeds,</L>

<L>Then spring the living herbs, profusely wild,</L>

<L>With what the dull incurious weeds account,</L>

<L>Innumerous, mix'd them with the nursing mold,</L>

<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<Q>The subject proposed. Addressed to Mr. <HI>ONSLOW.</HI>
A prospect of the fields ready for harvest. Reflections in
praise of industry, raised by that view. Reaping. A
tale relative to it. A harvest-storm. Shooting and
hunting, their barbarity. A ludicrous account of
fox-hunting. A view of an orchard. Wall-fruit.
A vineyard. A description of fogs, frequent in the
latter part of <HI>AUTUMN:</HI> whence a digression, en∣quiring
into the rise of fountains and rivers. Birds
of season considered, that now shift their habitation.
The prodigious number of them that cover the northern
and western isles of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence a view of
the country. A prospect of the discoloured fading
woods. After a gentle dusky day, moon-light. Au∣tumnal
meteors. Morning: to which succeeds a calm,
pure, sun-shiny day, such as usually shuts up the sea∣son.
The harvest being gathered in, the country dis∣solved
in joy. The whole concludes with a panygeric
on a philosophical country life.</Q>
