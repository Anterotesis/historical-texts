<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Peregrine Pickle.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An account of Mr. Gamaliel Pickle. The dispo∣sition
of his sister described. He yields to her
sollicitations, and retires to the country.</HEAD>
<P>IN a certain county of England, bounded on
one side by the sea, and at the distance of
one hundred miles from the metropolis, lived
Gamaliel Pickle Es{que} the father of that hero
whose adventures we propose to record. He was
the son of a merchant in London, who (like
Rome) from small beginnings, had raised himself
to the highest honours of the city, and acquired
a plentiful fortune, tho', to his infinite regret,
he died before it amounted to a Plum, conjuring
his son, as he respected the last injunction of a
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
parent, to imitate his industry and adhere to his
maxims, until he should have made up the defi∣ciency,
which was a sum considerably less than
fifteen thousand pounds.</P>
<P>This pathetic remonstrance had the desired ef∣fect
upon his representative, who spared no pains
to fulfil the request of the deceased; but exerted
all the capacity with which nature had endowed
him, in a series of efforts, which, however, did
not succeed; for, by that time he had been fifteen
years in trade, he found himself five thousand
pounds worse than he was when he first took pos∣session
of his father's effects: a circumstance that
affected him so nearly, as to detach his inclina∣tions
from business, and induce him to retire from
the world, to some place where he might at lei∣sure
deplore his misfortunes, and, by frugality,
secure himself from want, and the apprehensions
of a jail, with which his imagination was inces∣santly
haunted. He was often heard to express
his fears of coming upon the parish; and to bless
God, that, on account of his having been so long
a housekeeper, he was intitled to that provision.
In short, his talents were not naturally active,
and there was a sort of inconsistency in his cha∣racter;
for, with all the desire of amassing which
any citizen could possibly entertain, he was en∣cumbered
by a certain indolence and sluggishness
that prevailed over every interested consideration,
and even hindered him from profiting by that
singleness of apprehension, and moderation of ap∣petites,
which have so frequently conduced to the
acquisition of immense fortunes, and which he
possessed in a very remarkable degree. Nature,
in all probability, had mixed little or nothing in∣flammable
in his composition; or, whatever seeds
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
of excess she might have sown within him, were
effectually stifled and destroyed by the austerity of
his education.</P>
<P>The sallies of his youth, far from being inor∣dinate
or criminal, never exceeded the bounds of
that decent jollity which an extraordinary pot,
on extraordinary occasions, may be supposed to
have produced in a club of sedate book-keepers,
whose imaginations were neither very warm nor
luxuriant. Little subject to refined sensations, he
was scarce ever disturbed with violent emotions
of any kind. The passion of love never inter∣rupted
his tranquillity; and if, as Mr. Creech says
after Horace,</P>
<P>Not to admire is all the art, I know,</P>
<P>To make men happy, and to keep them so.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle was undoubtedly possessed of that inva∣luable
secret; at least, he was never known fo
betray the faintest symptom of transport, except
one evening at the club, where he observed, with
some demonstrations of vivacity, that he had dined
upon a delicate loin of veal.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this appearance of phlegm,
he could not help feeling his disappointments in
trade; and upon the failure of a certain under∣writer,
by which he lost five hundred pounds, de∣clared
his design of relinquishing business, and re∣tiring to the country. In this resolution he was
comforted and encouraged by his only sister Mrs.
Grizzle, who had managed his family, since the
death of his father, and was now in the thirtieth
year of her maidenhood, with a fortune of five
thousand pounds, and a large stock of oeconomy
and devotion.</P>
<P>These qualifications, one would think, might
have been the means of abridging the term of
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
her celibacy, as she never expressed any aversion
for wedlock; but, it seems, she was too delicate
in her choice, to find a mate to her inclination in
the city: for I cannot suppose that she remained
so long unsollicited; tho' the charms of her person
were not altogether enchanting, nor her manner
over and above agreeable. Exclusive of a very wan
(not to call it a sallow) complexion, which per∣haps
was the effect of her virginity and mortifica∣tion,
she had a cast in her eyes that was not at all
engaging, and such an extent of mouth, as no art
or affectation could contract into any proportion∣able
dimension: then her piety was rather peevish
than resigned, and did not in the least diminish a
certain stateliness in her demeanour and conversa∣tion,
that delighted in communicating the impor∣tance
and honour of her family, which, by the bye,
was not to be traced two generations back, by
all the power of heraldry or tradition.</P>
<P>She seemed to have renounced all the ideas she
had acquired before her father served the office of
sheriff; and the aera which regulated the dates of
all her observations, was the mayoralty of her
papa. Nay, so sollicitous was this good lady for
the support and propagation of the family-name,
that, suppressing every selfish motive, she actually
prevailed upon her brother to combat his own
disposition, and even surmount it so far, as to de∣clare
a passion for the person whom he afterwards
wedded, as we shall see in the sequel. Indeed,
she was the spur that instigated him in all his ex∣traordinary
undertakings; and I question whe∣ther
or not he would have been able to disengage
himself from that course of life in which he had
so long mechanically moved, unless he had been
roused and actuated by her incessant exhortations.
London, she observed, was a receptacle of ini∣quity,
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
where an honest unsuspecting man was
every day in danger of falling a sacrifice to craft;
where innocence was exposed to continual tempta∣tions,
and virtue eternally persecuted by malice
and slander; where every thing was ruled by ca∣price
and corruption, and merit utterly discou∣raged
and despised. This last imputation she pro∣nounced
with such emphasis and chagrin, as plainly
denoted how far she considered herself an example
of what she advanced; and really, the charge
was justified by the constructions that were put
upon her retreat by her female friends, who, far
from imputing it to the laudable motives that in∣duced
her, insinuated, in sarcastic commenda∣tions,
that she had good reason to be dissatisfied
with a place where she had been so long over∣looked;
and that it was certainly her wisest course
to make her last effort in the country, where, in
all probability, her talents would be less eclipsed,
and her fortune more attractive.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, her admonitions, tho' they
were powerful enough to convince, would have
been insufficient to overcome the languor and <HI>vis
inertiae</HI> of her brother, had she not reinforced her
arguments, by calling in question the credit of
two or three merchants, with whom he was em∣barked
in trade.</P>
<P>Alarmed at these hints of intelligence, he ex∣erted
himself effectually; and having withdrawn
his money, which he had laid out in Bank stock
and India bonds, removed to a house in the coun∣try,
that his father had built near the sea-side, for
the convenience of carrying on a certain branch
of traffick in which he had been deeply concerned.</P>
<P>Here then Mr. Pickle fixed his habitation for
life, in the six-and-thirtieth year of his age; and
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
tho' the pangs he felt at parting with his intimate
companions, and quitting all his former con∣nexions,
were not quite so keen as to produce any
dangerous disorder in his constitution, he did not
fail to be extremely disconcerted at his first en∣trance
into a scene of life to which he was totally
a stranger. Not but that he met with abundance
of people in the country, who, in consideration
of his fortune, courted his acquaintance, and
breathed nothing, but friendship and hospitality:
yet even the trouble of receiving and returning
these civilities, was an intolerable fatigue to a man
of his habits and disposition. He therefore lest
the care of the ceremonial to his sister, who in∣dulged
herself in all the pride of formality, while
he himself, having made a discovery of a public
house in the neighbourhood, went thither every
evening and enjoyed his pipe and cann; being
very well satisfied with the behaviour of the land∣lord,
whose communicative temper was a great
comfort to his own taciturnity; for he shunned all
superfluity of speech, as much as he avoided any
other unnecessary expence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is made acquainted with the characters of Com∣modore
Trunnion and his adherents; meets with
them by accident, and contracts an intimacy with
that commander.</HEAD>
<P>THIS loquacious publican soon gave him
sketches of all the characters in the county;
and, among others, described that of his next
neighbour Commodore Trunnion, which was al∣together
singular and odd. “The commodore
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
and your worship (said he) will in a short time
be hand and glove; he has a power of money,
and spends like a prince—that is, in his own way—
for to be sure he is a little humoursome, as the
saying is, and swears woundily; tho' I'll be
sworn he means no more harm than a sucking
babe. Lord help us! it will do your honour's
heart good to hear him tell a story, as how he lay
along-side of the French, yard-arm and yard-arm,
board and board, and of heaving grapplings,
and stink-pots, and grapes, and round and double-headed
partridges, crows and carters—Laud have
mercy upon us! he has been a great warrior in
his time, and lost an eye and a heel in the ser∣vice—
Then, he does not live like any other
Christian land-man; but keeps garrison in his
house, as if he were in the midst of his enemies,
and makes his servants turn out in the night,
watch and watch (as he calls it) all the year
round. His habitation is defended by a ditch,
over which he has laid a draw-bridge, and planted
his court-yard with patereroes continually load∣ed
with shot, under the direction of one Mr.
Hatchway, who had one of his legs shot away,
while he acted as lieutenant on board of the com∣modore's
ship; and now, being on half-pay, lives
with him as his companion. The lieutenant is
a very brave man, a great joker, and, as the say∣ing
is, hath got the length of his commander's
foot—Tho' he has another favourite in the house
called Tom Pipes, that was his boatswain's mate,
and now keeps the servants in order. Tom is a
man of few words, but an excellent hand at a
song concerning the boatswain's whistle, hussle∣cap
and chuck-farthing—there is not such another
pipe in the county—So that the commodore lives
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
very happy in his own manner; thos he be some∣times
thrown into perilous passions and quan∣daries,
by the application of his poor kinsmen,
whom he can't abide, because as how some of
them were the first occasion of his going to sea.
Then he sweats with agony at the sight of an at∣torney;
just for all the world, as some people
have an antipathy at a cat; for it seems he was
once at law, for striking one of his officers, and
cast in a swinging sum. He is, moreover, ex∣ceedingly
afflicted with goblins that disturb his
rest, and keep such a racket in his house, that
you would think (God bless us!) all the devils in
hell had broke loose upon him. It was no longer
ago than last year about this time, that he was
tormented the live-long night by two mischievous
spirits that got into his chamber, and played a
thousand pranks about his hammock, (for there
is not one bed within his walls.) Well, Sir, he
rung his bell, called up all his servants, got lights,
and made a thorough search; but the devil a
goblin was to be found. He had no sooner turned
in again, and the rest of the family gone to sleep,
than the foul fiends began their game anew. The
commodore got up in the dark, drew his cutlass,
and attacked them both so manfully, that, in five
minutes, every thing in the apartment went to
pieces. The lieutenant hearing the noise, came
to his assistance; and Tom Pipes being told what
was the matter, lighted his match, and going
down to the yard, fired all the patereroes, as sig∣nals
of distress. Well, to be sure, the whole
parish was in a pucker: some thought the French
had landed; others imagined the commodore's
house was beset by thieves: for my own part, I
called up two dragoons that are quartered upon
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
me; and they swore with deadly oaths, it was a
gang of smugglers engaged with a party of their
regiment that lies in the next village; and mount∣ing
their horses like lusty fellows, rode up into
the country as fast as their beasts could carry
them. Ah, Master! these are hard times, when
an industrious body cannot earn his bread, without
fear of the gallows. Your worship's father (God
rest his soul!) was a good gentleman, and as
well respected in this parish, as e'er a he that
walks upon neat's leather. And if your honour
should want a small parcel of fine tea, or a few
anchors of right Nantz, I'll be bound you shall
be surnished to your heart's content. But, as I
was saying, the hubbub continued till morning,
when the parson being sent for, conjured the spi∣rits
into the Red Sea; and the house has been
pretty quiet ever since. True it is, Mr. Hatch∣way
makes a mock of the whole affair; and told
his commander in this very blessed spot, that the
two goblins were no other than a couple of jack∣daws
which had fallen down the chimney, and
made a flapping with their wings up and down
the apartment. But the commodore, who is
very choleric, and does not like to be jeered, fell
into a main high passion, and stormed like a per∣fect
hurricane, swearing that he knew a devil
from a jack-daw as well as e'er a man in the
three kingdoms. He owned, indeed, that the
birds were found, but denied that they were the
occasion of the uproar. For my own part,
Master, I believe much may be said on both sides
of the question; thos to be sure, the devil is al∣ways
going about, as the saying is.”</P>
<P>This circumstantial account, extraordinary as
it was, never altered one feature in the counte∣nance
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
of Mr. Pickle, who having heard it to an
end, took the pipe from his mouth, saying, with a
look of infinite sagacity and deliberation, “I do
suppose he is of the Cornish Trunnions. What
sort of a woman is his spouse?” “Spouse!
cried the other; odd's heart! I don't think he
would marry the queen of Sheba. Lack a day!
Sir, he won't suffer his own maids to lie in the
garrison, but turns them into an out-house, every
night, before the watch is set. Bless your ho∣nour's
soul! he is, as it were, a very oddish kind
of a gentleman. Your worship would have seen
him before now; for, when he is well, he and
my good master Hatchway come hither every
evening, and drink a couple of canns of rumbo
apiece; but he has been confined to his house
this fortnight, by a plaguy fit of the gout, which,
I'll assure your worship, is a good penny out of
my pocket.”</P>
<P>At that instant, Mr. Pickle's ears were saluted
with such a strange noise, as even discomposed
the muscles of his face, which gave immediate
indications of alarm. This composition of notes
at first resembled the crying of quails, and croak∣ing
of bull-frogs; but, as it approached nearer,
he could distinguish articulate sounds pronounced
with great violence, in such a cadence as one
would expect from a human creature scolding
thro' the organs of an ass. It was neither speak∣ing
nor braying, but a surprising mixture of both,
employed in the utterance of terms absolutely un∣intelligible
to our wondering merchant, who had
just opened his mouth to express his curiosity,
when the landlord, starting up at the well known
sound, cried, “Odd's niggers! there is the com∣modore
with his company, as sure as I live!”
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
and with his apron began to wipe the dust off an
elbow-chair placed at one side of the fire, and
kept sacred for the ease and convenience of this
infirm commander. While he was thus occu∣pied,
a voice still more uncouth than the former,
bawled aloud, “Ho! the house, a hoy!” Up∣on
which the publican, clapping an hand to each
side of his head, with his thumbs fixed on his
ears, rebellowed in the same tone, which he had
learned to imitate, “Hilloah.” The voice
again exclaimed, “Have you got any attorneys
aboard?” and when the landlord replied,
“No, no;” this man of strange expectation
came in, supported by his two dependants, and
displayed a figure every way answerable to the
oddity of his character. He was in stature at
least six feet high, tho' he had contracted an ha∣bit
of stooping, by living so long on board; his
complexion was tawny, and his aspect rendered
hideous by a large scar across his nose, and a
patch that covered the place of one eye. Being
seated in his chair, with great formality the land∣lord
complimented him upon his being able to
come abroad again; and having, in a whisper,
communicated the name of his fellow-guest,
whom the commodore already knew by report,
went to prepare, with all imaginable dispatch, the
first allowance of his favourite liquor, in three
separate canns, (for each was accommodated with
his own portion apart) while the lieutenant sat
down on the blind-side of his commander; and
Tom Pipes, knowing his distance, with great
modesty took his station in the rear. After a
pause of some minutes, the conversation was be∣gun
by this ferocious chief, who fixing his eye
upon the li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utenant with a sternness of counte∣nance
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
not to be described, addressed him in these
words: “D—n my eyes! Hatchway, I always
took you to be a better seaman than to overset
our chaise in such fair weather. Blood ! didn't
I tell you we were running bump ashore, and bid
you set in the lee-brace, and haul upon a wind ?”
“Yes, replied the other with an arch sneer, I
do confess as how you did give such orders, after
you had run us foul of a post, so as that the car∣riage
lay along, and could not right herself.” “I
run you foul of a post! cried the commander;
d—n my heart! you're a pretty dog, an't you,
to tell me so above board to my face? Did I
take charge of the chaise? Did I stand at the
helm?” No, answered Hatchway; that I must
confess you did not steer; but howsomever, you
cunned all the way, and so, as you could not see
how the land lay, being blind of your larboard
eye, we were fast ashore, before you knew any
thing of the matter. Pipes, who stood abaft,
can testify the truth of what I say.” “D—n
my limbs! resumed the commodore, I don't va∣lue
what you or Pipes says, a rope yarn. You're
a couple of mutinous—I'll say no more; but,
you shan't run your rig upon me. Damn
ye, I am the man that learnt you, Jack
Hatchway, to splice a rope, and raise a perpendi∣cular.”</P>
<P>The lieutenant, who was perfectly well ac∣quainted
with the trim of his captain, did not
chuse to carry on the altercation any farther; but,
taking up his cann, drank to the health of the
stranger, who very courteously returned the com∣pliment,
without, however, presuming to join
in the conversation, which suffered a considerable
pause. During this interruption, Mr. Hatch∣way's
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
way's wit display'd itself in several practical jokes
upon the commodore, with whom, he knew, it
was dangerous to tamper in any other way. Being
without the sphere of his vision, he securely pil∣fered
his tobacco, drank his rumbo, made wry faces,
and (to use the vulgar phrase) cocked his eye at
him, to the no small entertainment of the specta∣tors,
Mr. Pickle himself not excepted, who gave
evident tokens of uncommon satisfaction at the
dexterity of this marine pantomime.</P>
<P>Mean while, the captain's choler gradually sub∣sided,
and he was pleased to desire Hatchway by
the familiar and friendly diminutive of Jack, to
read a news-paper that lay on the table before
him. This task was accordingly undertaken by
the lame lieutenant, who, among other para∣graphs,
read that which follows, with an eleva∣tion
of voice that seemed to prognosticate some∣thing
extraordinary. “We are informed that
admiral Bower will very soon be created a British
peer, for his eminent services during the war,
particularly in his late engagement with the French
fleet.” Trunnion was thunder-struck at this
piece of intelligence. The mug dropt from his
hand, and shivered into a thousand pieces; his
eye glistened like that of a rattle-snake, and some
minutes elapsed before he could pronounce,
“Avast! overhaul that article again.” It was
no sooner read the second time, than smiting
the table with his fist, he started up, and with
the most violent emphasis of rage and indignation,
exclaimed, “D—n my heart and liver! 'tis a
land lie, d'ye see; and I will maintain it to be a
lie, from the sprit-sail-yard to the mizzen top-sail
haulyards! blood and thunder! Will. Bower a
peer of this realm! a fellow of yesterday, that
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
scarce knows a mast from a manger; a snotty∣nose
boy, whom I myself have ordered to the
gun, for stealing eggs out of the hen-coops! and
I Hawser Trunnion, who commanded a ship be∣fore
he could keep a reckoning, am laid aside,
d'ye see, and forgotten! If so be, as this be the
case, there is a rotten plank in our constitution,
which ought to be hove down and repaired, damn
my eyes! For my own part, d'ye see, I was
none of your Guinea-pigs; I did not rise in the
service by parliamenteering interest, or a hand∣some
bitch of a wife. I was not hoisted over
the bellies of better men, nor strutted athwart
the quarter-deck in a laced doublet and thingum∣bobs
at the wrists. Damn my limbs! I have been
a hard-working man, and served all offices on
board from cook's shifter to the command of a
vessel. Here, you Tunley, there's the hand of
a seaman, you dog.” So saying, he laid hold on
the landlord's fist, and honoured him with such a
squeeze, as compelled him to roar with great vo∣ciferation,
to the infinite satisfaction of the com∣modore,
whose features were a little unbended,
by this acknowledgment of his vigour; and he
thus proceeded in a less outrageous strain: “They
make a damned noise about this engagement with
the French: but, agad! it was no more than
a bum-boat battle, in comparison with some that
I have seen. There was old Rook and Jennings,
and another whom I'll be damned before I name,
that knew what fighting was. As for my own
share, d'ye see, I am none of those that hollow
in their own commendation: but if so be that
I were minded to stand my own trumpeter, some
of those little fellows that hold their heads so
high, would be taken all aback, as the saying is;
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
they would be ashamed to shew their colours,
d—n my eyes! I once lay eight glasses along-side
of the Floor de Louse, a French man of war,
tho' her metal was heavier, and her complement
larger by an hundred hands than mine. You,
Jack Hatchway, damn ye, what d'ye grin at?
D'ye think I tell a story, because you never
heard it before?”</P>
<P>“Why, look ye, Sir, answered the lieute∣nant,
I'm glad to find you can stand your own
trumpeter, on occasion; thof I wish you would
change the tune; for that is the same you have
been piping every watch, for these ten months
past. Tunley himself will tell you, he has heard
it five hundred times.” “God forgive you, Mr.
Hatchway, said the landlord, interrupting him;
as I'm an honest man, and a housekeeper, I ne∣ver
heard a syllab of the matter.”</P>
<P>This declaration, tho' not strictly true, was
extremely agreeable to Mr. Trunnion, who, with
an air of triumph, observed, “Aha! Jack, I
thought I should bring you up, with your gibes
and your jokes. But suppose you had heard it
before, is that any reason why it shouldn't be
told to another person? There's the stranger,
belike he has heard it five hundred times too;
han't ye, brother?” addressing himself to Mr.
Pickle; who, replying with a look expressing
curiosity, “No, never;” he thus went on:
“Well, you seem to be an honest, quiet sort of
a man; and therefore, you must know, as I
said before, I fell in with a French man of war,
Cape Finisterre bearing about six leagues on the
weather-bow, and the chace three leagues to
leeward, going before the wind: whereupon I set
my studding-sails, and coming up with her,
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
hoisted my jack and ensign, and poured in a
whole broadside, before you could count three
rattlins in the mizzen shrouds; for I always keep
a good look-out, and love to have the first fire.”
“That I'll be sworn, said Hatchway; for the
day we made the Triumph, you ordered the men
to fire, when she was hull-to, by the same to∣ken
we below pointed the guns at a flight of gulls;
and I won a cann of punch from the gunner, by
killing the first bird.” Exasperated at this sar∣casm,
he replied with great vehemence, “You
lie, lubber! d—n your bones! what business
have you to come always athwart my hawse in
this manner? You, Pipes, was upon deck, and
can bear witness, whether or not I fired too soon▪
Speak, you blood of a—and that upon the
word of a seaman: how did the chace bear of
us, when I gave orders to fire?”</P>
<P>Pipes, who hitherto had sat silent, being thus
called upon to give his evidence, after diverse
strange gesticulations, opened his mouth like a
gasping cod, and with a cadence like that of the
east wind singing through a cranny, pronounced,
“Half a quarter of a league right upon our lee∣beam.”
“Nearer, you porpuss-fac'd swab!
(cried the commodore) nearer by twelve fa∣thom:
but, howsomever, that's enough to
prove the falsehood of Hatchway's jaw—and so,
brother, d'ye see, (turning to Mr. Pickle) I lay
along-side of the Floor de Louse, yard-arm and
yard-arm, plying our great guns and small arms,
and heaving in stink-pots, powder-bottles, and
hand-grenades, till our shot was all expended,
double-headed, partridge and grape: then we
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aded with iron crows, marlin spikes, and old
nails, but finding the Frenchman took a great
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
deal of drubbing, and that he had shot away all
our rigging, and killed and wounded a great num∣ber
of our men, d'ye see, I resolved to run him
on board upon his quarter, and so ordered our
grapplings to be got ready; but Monsieur per∣ceiving
what we were about, filled his topsails
and sheered off, leaving us like a log upon the
water, and our scuppers running with blood.”</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle and the landlord paid such extra∣ordinary
attention to the rehearsal of this exploit,
that Trunnion was encouraged to entertain them
with more stories of the same nature, after which
he observed by way of encomium on the govern∣ment,
that all he had gained in the service was a
lame foot and the loss of an eye. The lieutenant,
who could not find in his heart to lose any oppor∣tunity
of being witty at the expence of his com∣mander,
gave a loose to his satirical talent once
more, saying, “I have heard as how you came
by your lame foot, by having your upper-decks
overstowed with liquor, whereby you became
crank, and rolled, d'ye see, in such a manner,
that by a pitch of the ship, your starboard heel
was jammed in one of the scuppers; and as for
the matter of your eye, that was knocked out by
your own crew when the Lightning was paid off:
there's poor Pipes, who was beaten into all the
colours of the rainbow for taking your part, and
giving you time to sheer off; and I don't find as
how you have rewarded him according as he de∣serves.”
As the commodore could not deny the
truth of these anecdotes, however unseasonably
they were introduced, he affected to receive them
with good humour, as jokes of the lieutenant's
own inventing; and reply'd, “Ay, ay, Jack,
every body knows your tongue is no slander;
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
but, howsomever, I'll work you to an oil for
this, you dog.” So saying, he lifted up one of his
crutches, intending to lay it gently a cross Mr.
Hatchway's pate; but, Jack, with great agility,
tilted up his wooden leg, with which he warded
off the blow, to the no small admiration of Mr.
Pickle, and utter astonishment of the landlord,
who, by the bye, had expressed the same amaze∣ment,
at the same feat, at the same hour, every
night, for three months before. Trunnion then
directing his eye to the boatswain's mate, “You,
Pipes, (said he) do you go about and tell people
that I did not reward you for standing by me,
when I was hussled by those rebellious rapscallions;
damn you, ha'n't you been rated on the books
ever snce?” Tom, who indeed had no words
to spare, sat smoaking his pipe with great indiffe∣rence,
and never dreamed of paying any regard
to these interrogations, which being repeated
and reinforced with many oaths, that (however)
produced no effect, the commodore pulled out
his purse, saying, “Here, you bitch's baby, here's
something better than a smart ticket; and threw
it at his silent deliverer, who received and pock∣eted
his bounty, without the least demonstration
of surprize or satisfaction; while the donor turn∣ing
to Mr. Pickle, “You see brother, (said he)
I make good the old saying, we sailors get money
like horses, and spend it like asses; come, Pipes,
let's have the boatswain's whistle, and be jovial.”
This musician accordingly, applied to his mouth
the silver instrument that hung at a button-hole
of his jacket, by a chain of the same metal, and
though not quite so ravishing as the pipe of
Hermes, produced a sound so loud and shrill, that
the stranger (as it were instinctively) stopped
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
his ears, to preserve his organs of hearing from
such a dangerous invasion. The prelude being
thus executed, Pipes fixed his eyes upon the egg
of an ostrich that depended from the cieling,
and without once moving them from that object,
performed the whole cantata in a tone of voice
that seemed to be the joint issue of an Irish bag∣pipe,
and a sow-gelder's horn; the commodore,
the lieutenant and landlord joined in the chorus,
repeating this elegant stanza,
<Q><L>Bustle, bustle, brave boys!</L>
<L>Let us sing, let us toil,</L>
<L>And drink all the while,</L>
<L>Since labour's the price of our joys.</L></Q></P>
<P>The third line was no sooner pronounced, than
the cann was lifted to every man's mouth with
admirable uniformity; and the next word taken
up at the end of their draught, with a twang
equally expressive and harmonious. In short,
the company began to understand one another;
Mr. Pickle seemed to relish the entertainment,
and a correspondence immediately commenced
between him and Trunnion, who shook him by
the hand, drank to further acquaintance, and
even invited him to a mess of pork and pease in
the garrison. The compliment was returned,
good fellowship prevailed, and the night was
pretty far advanced, when the merchant's man
arrived with a lanthorn to light his master home;
upon which, the new friends parted, after a mu∣tual
promise of meeting next evening in the same
place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Grizzle exerts herself in finding a proper
match for her brother; who is accordingly intro∣duced
to the young lady whom he marries in due
season.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been the more circumstantial in opening
the character of Trunnion, because he bears
a considerable share in the course of these me∣moirs;
but, now it is high time to resume the
consideration of Mrs. Grizzle, who, since her
arrival in the country, had been engrossed by a
double care, namely, that of finding a suitable
match for her brother, and a comfortable yoke∣fellow
for herself.</P>
<P>Neither was this aim the result of any sini∣ster
or frail suggestion, but the pure dictates of
that laudable ambition, which prompted her to
the preservation of the family name. Nay, so
disinterested was she in this pursuit, that, post∣poning
her nearest concern, or at least leaving
her own fate to the silent operation of her charms,
she laboured with such indefatigable zeal in behalf
of her brother, that before they had been three
months settled in the country, the general topick
of conversation in the neighbourhood, was an in∣tended
match between the rich Mr. Pickle and
the fair miss Appleby, daughter of a gentleman
who lived in the next parish, and who, though
he had but little fortune to bestow upon his chil∣dren,
had to (use his own phrase) replenished
their veins with some of the best blood in the
county.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29"/>
This young lady, whose character and dispo∣sition
Mrs. Grizzle had investigated to her own
satisfaction, was destined for the spouse of Mr.
Pickle, and an overture accordingly made to her
father, who being overjoyed at the proposal, gave
his consent without hesitation, and even recom∣mended
the immediate execution of the project
with such eagerness, as seemed to indicate either
a suspicion of Mr. Pickle's constancy, or a diffi∣dence
of his own daughter's complexion, which,
perhaps, he thought too sanguine, to keep much
longer cool. The previous point being thus set∣tled,
our merchant, at the instigation of Mrs.
Grizzle, went to visit his future father-in-law,
and was introduced to the daughter, with whom
he had, that same afternoon, an opportunity of
being alone. What passed in that interview, I
never could learn, though from the character of
the suitor, the reader may justly conclude that
she was not much teized with the impertinence
of his addresses. He was not, I believe, the less
welcome for that reason; certain it is, she made
no objection to his taciturnity, and when her fa∣ther
communicated his resolution, acquiesced
with the most pious resignation. But, Mrs. Griz∣zle,
in order to give the lady a more favourable
idea of his intellects than what his conversation
could possibly inspire, was resolved to dictate a
letter, which her brother should transcribe and
transmit to his mistress, as the produce of his own
understanding; and had actually composed a very
tender billet for this purpose; yet her intention
was intirely frustrated by the misapprehension of
the lover himself, who, in consequence of his sis∣ter's
repeated admonitions, anticipated her scheme,
by writing for himself, and dispatching the letter
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
one afternoon, while Mrs. Grizzle was visiting
at the parson's.</P>
<P>Neither was this step the effect of his vanity or
precipitation; but having been often assured by
his sister, that it was absolutely necessary for him
to make a declaration of his love in writing, he
took this opportunity of acting in conformity to
her advice, when his imagination was unengaged
or undisturbed by any other suggestion, without
suspecting in the least, that she intended to save
him the trouble of exercising his own genius.
Left, therefore, as he imagined, to his own in∣ventions,
he sat down and produced the following
morceau, which was transmitted to miss Appleby,
before his sister and counsellor had the least inti∣mation
of the affair.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Miss SALLY APPLEBY,
<SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNderstanding you have a parcel of heart;
warranted found, to be disposed of, shall
be willing to treat for said commodity, on reason∣able
terms; doubt not, shall agree for same; shall
wait of you for further information, when and
where you shall appoint. This the needful from</P>
<CLOSER>Yours, &amp;c.
<SIGNED>GAM. PICKLE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This laconic epistle, simple and unadorned as
it was, met with as cordial a reception from the
person to whom it was addressed, as if it had
been couched in the most elegant terms that deli∣cacy
of passion and cultivated genius could sup∣ply:
nay, I believe, was the more welcome, on
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
account of its mercantile plainness; because
when an advantageous match is in view, a sensi∣ble
woman often considers the flowery professions
and rapturous exclamations of love, as ensnaring
ambiguities, or at best impertinent preliminaries,
that retard the treaty they are designed to pro∣mote:
whereas Mr. Pickle removed all disagree∣able
uncertainty, by descending at once to the most
interesting particular.</P>
<P>She had no sooner, as a dutiful child, commu∣nicated
this billet-doux to her father, than he as a
careful parent visited Mr. Pickle, and in presence of
Mrs. Grizzle, demanded a formal explanation of
his sentiments with regard to his daughter Sally.
Mr. Gamaliel, without any ceremony, assured
him he had a respect for the young woman, and
with his good leave, would take her for better for
worse; and Mr. Appleby, after having expressed
his satisfaction that he had fixed his affections in
his family, and comforted the lover with the as∣surance
of his being agreeable to the young lady,
they forthwith proceeded to the articles of the
marriage-settlement, which being discussed and
determined, a lawyer was ordered to engross
them; the wedding cloaths were bought, and in
short, a day was appointed for the celebration of
their nuptials, to which every body of any fa∣shion
in the neighbourhood was invited. Among
these commodore Trunnion and Mr. Hatchway
were not forgotten, being the sole companions
of the bridegroom, with whom, by this time,
they had contracted a sort of intimacy at their
nocturnal rendezvous.</P>
<P>They had received a previous intimation of
what was on the anvil, from the landlord, before
Mr. Pickle thought proper to declare himself; in
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
consequence of which, the topick of the one eyed
commander's discourse at their meeting for seve∣ral
evenings before, had been the folly and plague
of matrimony; on which he held forth with
great vehemence of abuse, levelled at the fair sex,
whom he represented as devils incarnate sent
from hell, to torment mankind; and in particu∣lar,
inveighed against old maids, for whom he
seemed to entertain a singular aversion; while
his friend Jack confirmed the truth of all
his allegations, and gratified his own malig∣nant
vein at the same time, by clenching every
sentence with a fly joke upon the married state,
built upon some allusion to a ship or sea-faring
life. He compared a woman to a great gun loaded
with fire, brimstone and noise, which being vio∣lently
heated, will bounce and fly, and play the
devil, if you don't take special care of her breech∣ings.
He said she was like a hurricane that ne∣ver
blows from one quarter, but veers about to
all points of the compass: he likened her to a
painted galley curiously rigged, with a leak in her
hold, which her husband would never be able to
stop. He observed that her inclinations were like
the Bay of Biscay; for why? because you may
heave your deep sea lead long enough, without
ever reaching the bottom. That he who comes
to an anchor on a wife, may find himself moored
in damned foul ground, and after all, can't for
his blood slip his cable; and that for his own part,
thof he might make short trips for pastime, he
would never embark in woman on the voyage of
life, because he was afraid of foundering in the
first foul weather.</P>
<P>In all probability, these insinuations made some
impression on the mind of Mr. Pickle, who was
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
not very much inclined to run great risks of any
kind; but the injunctions and importunities of
his sister, who was bent upon the match, over∣balanced
the opinion of his sea friends, who
finding him determined to marry, notwithstand∣ing
all the hints of caution they had thrown out,
resolved to accept his invitation, and honoured
his nuptials with their presence accordingly.</P>

whole exertion, to play off the artillery of her

was perfectly obliging; and though, consci∣ous
of the extraordinary capacity of her mouth,
she would not venture to hazard a laugh, she
modelled her lips into an enchanting simper,
which played upon her countenance all day long;
nay, she even profited by that defect in her vision
we have already observed, and securely contem∣plated
those features which were most to her like∣ing,
while the rest of the company believed her
regards were disposed in a quite contrary direction.
With what humility of complaisance did she re∣ceive
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
the compliments of those who could not
help praising the elegance of the banquet! and
how piously did she seize that opportunity of com∣memorating
the honours of her fire, by observing
that it was no merit in her to understand some∣thing
of entertainments, as she had occasion to
preside at so many, during the mayoralty of her
papa! Far from discovering the least symptom of
pride and exultation, when the opulence of her
family became the subject of conversation, she
assumed a severity of countenance; and after
having moralized on the vanity of ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, declared
that those who looked upon her as a fortune,
were very much mistaken; for her father had left
her no more than poor five thousand pounds,
which, with what little she had saved of the inte∣rest
since his death, was all she had to depend
upon: indeed, if she had placed her chief felicity
in wealth, she should not have been so forward
in destroying her own expectations, by advising
and promoting the event at which they were now
so happily assembled; but she hoped she should
always have virtue enough to postpone any inte∣rested
consideration, when it should happen to
clash with the happiness of her friends. Fi∣nally,
such was her modesty and self denial, that
she industriously informed those whom it might
concern, that she was no less than three years
older than the bride; though had she added ten
to the reckoning, she would have committed no
mistake in point of computation.</P>
<P>To contribute as much as lay in her power to
the satisfaction of all present, she in the afternoon
regaled them with a tune on the harpsichord, ac∣companied
with her voice, which, though not the
most melodious in the world, I dare say, would
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
have been equally at their service, could she have
vyed with Philomel in song; and as the last effort
of her complaisance when dancing was proposed,
she was prevailed upon, at the request of her new
sister, to open the ball in person.</P>
<P>In a word, Mrs. Grizzle was the principal figure
in this festival, and almost eclipsed the bride, who
far from seeming to dispute the preheminence,
very wisely allowed her to make the best of her
talents; contenting herself with the lot to which
fortune had already called her, and which she
imagined would not be the less desirable, if her
sister-in-law were detached from the family.</P>
<P>I believe I need scarce advertise the reader,
that during this whole entertainment, the com∣modore
and his lieutenant were quite out of their
element; and this indeed, was the case with the
bridegroom himself, who being utterly unac∣quainted
with any sort of polite commerce, found
himself under a very disagreeable restraint during
the whole scene.</P>
<P>Trunnion, who had scarce ever been on shore
till he was paid off, and never once in his whole
life, in the company of any females above the
rank of those who herd upon the point at Ports∣mouth,
was more embarrassed about his beha∣viour
than if he had been surrounded at sea by
the whole French navy. He had never pro∣nounced
the word <HI>Madam</HI> since he was born, so
that far from entering into conversation with the
ladies, he would not even return the compliment,
or give the least nod of civility when they drank
to his health; and I verily believe, would rather
have suffered suffocation, than allowed the simple
phrase, <HI>your servant</HI>, to proceed from his mouth.
He was altogether as inflexible with respect to the
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
attitudes of his body; for, either through obsti∣nacy
or bashfulness, he sat upright without mo∣tion,
insomuch that he provoked the mirth of a
certain wag, who addressing himself to the lieu∣tenant,
asked whether that was the commodore
himself, or the wooden lion that used to stand at
his gate? An image to which, it must be owned,
Mr. Trunnion's person bore no faint resemblance.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatchway, who was not quite so unpo∣lished
as the commodore, and had certain notions
that seemed to approach the ideas of common life,
made a less uncouth appearance; but then he was
a wit, and though of a very peculiar genius, par∣took
largely of that disposition which is common
to all wits, who never enjoy themselves, except
when their talents meet with those marks of di∣stinction
and veneration, which (in their own
opinion) they deserve.</P>
<P>These circumstances being premised, it is
not to be wondered at, if this triumvirate made
no objections to the proposal, when some of
the grave personages of the company made a
motion for adjourning into another apartment,
where they might enjoy their pipes and bottles,
while the young folks indulged themselves in the
continuance of their own favourite diversion. Thus
rescued, as it were, from a state of annihilation, the
first use the two lads of the castle made of their ex∣istence,
was to ply the bridegroom so hard with
bumpers, that in less than an hour he made divers
efforts to sing, and soon after was carried to bed, de∣prived
of all manner of sensation, to the utter dis∣appointment
of the bridemen and maids, who, by
this accident, were prevented from throwing the
stocking, and performing certain other ceremo∣nies
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
practised on such occasions. As for the bride,
she bore this misfortune with great good humour,
and indeed, on all occasions, behaved like a dis∣creet
woman, perfectly well acquainted with the
nature of her own situation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Pickle assumes the reins of government in her
own family; her sister-in-law undertakes an
enterprize of great moment; but is for some time
diverted from her purpose, by a very interesting
consideration.</HEAD>
<P>WHatever deference, not to say submission,
she had paid to Mrs. Grizzle before
she was so nearly allied to her family, she no
sooner became Mrs. Pickle, than she thought it
incumbent upon her to act up to the dignity of
the character; and the very day after the mar∣riage,
ventured to dispute with her sister in-law
on the subject of her own pedigree, which she
affirmed to be more honourable in all respects than
that of her husband; observing that several
younger brothers of her house had arrived at the
station of lord mayor of London, which was the
highest pitch of greatness that any of Mr. Pickle's
predecessors had ever attained.</P>
<P>This presumption was like a thunderbolt to
Mrs. Grizzle, who began to perceive that she
had not succeeded quite so well as she imagined,
in selecting for her brother a gentle and obedient
yoke-fellow, who would always treat her with
that prosound respect which she thought due to
her superior genius, and be entirely regulated by
her advice and direction: however, she still con∣tinued
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
to manage the reins of government in the
house, reprehending the servants as usual; an of∣fice
she performed with great capacity, and in
which she seemed to take singular delight, until
Mrs. Pickle, on pretence of consulting her ease,
told her one day she would take that trouble upon
herself, and for the future assume the manage∣ment
of her own family. Nothing could be more
mortifying to Mrs. Grizzle than such a declara∣tion,
to which, after a considerable pause, and
strange distortion of look, she replied, “I shall
never refuse or repine at any trouble that may
conduce to my brother's advantage.” “Dear
madam,” answered the sister, “I am infinitely
obliged to your kind concern for Mr. Pickle's
interest, which I consider as my own, but I can∣not
bear to see you sufferer by your friendship;
and therefore, insist upon exempting you from
the fatigue you have borne so long.”</P>
<P>In vain did the other protest that she took
pleasure in the task; Mrs. Pickle ascribed the as∣surance
to her excess of complaisance, and ex∣pressed
such tenderness of zeal for her dear sister's
health and tranquillity, that the reluctant maiden
found herself obliged to resign her authority,
without enjoying the least pretext for complain∣ing
of her being deposed.</P>
<P>This disgrace was attended by a fit of peevish
devotion that lasted three or four weeks; during
which period, she had the additional chagreen of
seeing the young lady gain an absolute ascendency
over the mind of her brother, who was persuaded
to set up a gay equipage, and improve his house∣keeping,
by an augmentation in his expence, to
the amount of a thousand a year at least: tho'
this alteration in the oeconomy of his houshold,
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
effected no change in his own disposition, or man∣ner
of life; for, soon as the painful ceremony of
receiving and returning visits was performed, he
had recourse again to the company of his sea∣friends,
with whom he spent the best part of his
time. But, if he was satisfied with his condition,
the case was otherwise with Mrs. Grizzle, who
finding her importance in the family greatly di∣minished,
her attractions neglected by all the
male-sex in the neighbourhood, and the withering
hand of time hang threatning over her head, be∣gan
to feel the horror of eternal virginity, and in
a sort of desperation, resolved at any rate to
rescue herself from that reproachful and uncom∣fortable
situation. Thus determined, she formed
a plan, the execution of which, to a spirit less
enterprizing and sufficient than her's, would have
appeared altogether impracticable; this was no
other than to make a conquest of the commo∣dore's
heart, which the reader will easily believe
was not very susceptible of tender impressions;
but, on the contrary, fortified with insensibility
and prejudice against the charms of the whole
sex, and particularly prepossessed to the prejudice
of that class distinguished by the appellation of
old maids, in which Mrs. Grizzle was, by this
time, unhappily ranked. She nevertheless took
the field, and having invested this seemingly im∣pregnable
fortress, began to break ground one
day, when Trunnion dined at her brother's, by
springing certain ensnaring commendations on
the honesty and sincerity of sea-saring people,
paying a particular attention to his plate, and af∣fecting
a simper of approbation at every thing he
said which by any means she could construe into
a joke, or with modesty be supposed to hear:
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
nay, even when he left decency on the left hand,
(which was often the case) she ventured to repri∣mand
his freedom of speech with a gracious
grin, saying, “Sure you gentlemen belong∣ing
to the sea have such an odd way with you.”
But, all this complacency was so ineffectual, that,
far from suspecting the true cause of it, the com∣modore,
that very evening, at the club, in pre∣sence
of her brother, with whom, by this time,
he could take any manner of freedom, did not
scruple to damn her for a squinting, block-faced,
chattering piss-ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chen; and immediately after
drank despair to all old maids; a toast which
Mr. Pickle pledged without the least hesitation,
and next day intimated to his sister, who bore
the indignity with surprising resignation, and did
not therefore desist from her scheme, unpromising
as it seemed to be, until her attention was called
off, and engaged in another care, which, for
some time, interrupted the progress of this de∣sign.
Her sister had not been married many
months, when she exhibited evident symptoms
of pregnancy, to the general satisfaction of all
concerned, and the inexpressible joy of Mrs.
Grizzle, who (as we have already hinted) was
more interested in the preservation of the family∣name,
than in any other consideration what∣ever.
She therefore no sooner discovered appear∣ances
to justify and confirm her hopes, than post∣poning
her own purpose, and laying aside that
pique and resentment she had conceived from the
behaviour of Mrs. Pickle, when she superseded
her authority; or perhaps, considering her in no
other light than that of the vehicle which con∣tained,
and was destined to convey her brother's
heir to light, she determined to exert her utter∣most
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
in nursing, tending, and cherishing her,
during the term of her important charge. With
this view she purchased Culpepper's midwifery,
which, with that sagacious performance dignified
with Aristotle's name, she studied with indefati∣gable
care, and diligently perused the Compleat
House-wife, together with Quincy's dispensatory,
culling every jelly, marmalade and conserve
which these authors recommend as either salutary
or toothsome, for the benefit and comfort of her
sister-in-law, during her gestation. She restricted
her from eating roots, pot-herbs, fruit, and all
sort of vegetables; and one day when Mrs. Pickle
had plucked a peach with her own hand, and
was in the very act of putting it between her
teeth, Mrs. Grizzle perceived the rash attempt,
and running up to her, fell upon her knees in
the garden, intreating her, with tears in her
eyes, to resist such a pernicious appetite. Her
request was no sooner complied with, than recol∣lecting
that if her sister's longing was baulked,
the child might be affected with some disagreeable
mark, or deplorable disease, she begged as ear∣nestly
that she would swallow the fruit, and in
the mean time ran for some cordial water of her
own composing, which she forced upon her sister,
as an antidote to the poison she had received.</P>
<P>This excessive zeal and tenderness did not fail
to be very troublesome to Mrs. Pickle, who
having revolved divers plans for the recovery of
her own ease, at length determined to engage
Mrs. Grizzle in such employment as would inter∣rupt
that close attendance which she sound so
teizing and disagreeable. Neither did she wait
long for an opportunity of putting her resolution
in practice. The very next day, a gentleman
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
happening to dine with Mr. Pickle, unfortu∣nately
mentioned a pine-apple, part of which he
had eaten a week before at the house of a noble∣man
who lived in another part of the country,
at the distance of an hundred miles at least.</P>
<P>The name of this fatal fruit was no sooner
pronounced, than Mrs. Grizzle, who incessantly
watched her sister's looks, took the alarm, be∣cause
she thought they gave certain indications
of curiosity and desire; and after having observed
that she herself never could eat pine-apples,
which were altogether unnatural productions, ex∣torted
by the force of artificial fire, out of filthy
manure, asked with a faultering voice, if Mrs.
Pickle was not of her way of thinking? This
young lady, who wanted neither slyness nor pe∣netration,
at once divined her meaning, and re∣plied
with seeming unconcern, that for her own
part she should never repine, if there was not a
pine-apple in the universe, provided she could
indulge herself with the fruits of her own coun∣try.</P>
<P>This answer, which was calculated for the be∣nefit
of the stranger, who would certainly have
suffered for his impr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dence by the resentment of
Mrs. Grizzle, had her sister expressed the least
relish for the fruit in question: I say, this an∣swer
had the desired effect, and re-established the
peace of the company, which was not a little
endangered by the gentleman's want of considera∣tion.
Next morning, however, after breakfast,
the pregnant lady, in pursuance of her plan,
yawned (as it were by accident) full in the face
of her maiden sister, who being infinitely di∣sturbed
by this convulsion, affirmed it was a symp∣tom
of longing; and insisted upon knowing the
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
object in desire, when Mrs. Pickle affecting an
affected smile, told her she had eaten a most de∣licious
pine-apple in her sleep. This declara∣tion
was attended with an immediate scream ut∣tered
by Mrs. Grizzle, who instantly perceiving
her sister surprized at the exclamation, clasped
her in her arms, and assured her, with a sort of
hysterical laugh, importing horror rather than de∣light,
that she could not help screaming with joy,
because she had it in her power to gratify her
dear sister's wish; a lady in the neighbourhood
having promised to send her, in a present, a cou∣ple
of fine pine-apples, which she would that very
day go in quest of.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pickle would by no means consent to
this proposal, on pretence of sparing the other
unnecessary fatigue; and assured her, that, if she
had any desire to eat a pine-apple, it was so faint,
that the disappointment could produce no bad
consequence. But this assurance was conveyed
in a manner (which she knew very well how to
adopt) that instead of dissuading, rather stimu∣lated
Mrs. Grizzle to set out immediately, not
on a visit to that lady, whose promise she herself
had seigned with a view of consulting her sister's
tranquillity, but on a random search thro' the
whole county for this unlucky fruit, which was
like to produce so much vexation and prejudice to
her and her father's house.</P>
<P>During <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hree whole days and nights, did she,
attended by a valet, ride from place to place
without success, unmindful of her health, and
careless of her reputation, that began to suffer
from the nature of her inquiry, which was pur∣sued
with such peculiar eagerness and distraction▪
that every body with whom she conversed, looked
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
upon her as an unhappy person, whose intellects
were not a little disordered.</P>
<P>Baffled in all her researches within the county,
she at length resolved to visit that very nobleman,
at whose house the officious stranger had been
(for her) so unfortunately regaled, and actually
arrived in a post-chaise at the place of his habi∣tation,
where she introduced her business as an af∣fair
on which the happiness of a whole family
depended. But, alas! she had come too late;
his lordship lamented, in very polite and pathetic
terms, that he was disabled from exerting his hu∣manity,
and enjoying the pleasure he should feel
in contributing to the happiness of his fellow∣creatures,
at such an easy rate; telling her, that
he had unluckily, the very day before, sent the
two last pine-apples his garden had produced, in
a present to a certain lady in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle was so affected with this explana∣tion,
that she fainted away, and was immediately
carried to the public house, where she had left
her horses, and where she remained inconsolable
for the disappointment, which in all likelihood
would have proved more fatal to her than to the
person for whom she was so piously concerned,
had not she in the evening, by the medium of
her own servant, received a hint from the no∣bleman's
gardener, that for five pieces she should
be furnished with a couple of as fine apples as
ever were seen in England. The terms (I scarce
need say) were greedily embraced, the fruit se∣cured
in her possession; and she departed that
very night on her return to her brother's house,
where she safely arrived with her acquisition, and
was most cordially received by her sister, who
had been under some apprehensions on her ac∣count.
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
Neither was his lordship forgotten in
Mrs. Grizzle's benediction, when she understood
from the valet who accompanied her, that he
had, with his own eyes, seen above an hundred
pine-apples ripe for cutting in his garden the
evening of that very day on which he had as∣sured
her that there was not one left.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Grizzle is indefatigable in gratifying her
sister's longings. Peregrine is born, and ma∣naged
contrary to the directions and remonstrances
of his aunt, who is disgusted upon that account;
and resumes the plan which she had before re∣jected.</HEAD>
<P>THE success of this device would have en∣couraged
Mrs. Pickle to practise more of
the same sort upon her sister-in-law, had she not
been deterred by a violent fever which seized her
zealous ally, in consequence of the fatigue and
uneasiness she had undergone; which, while it
lasted, as effectually conduced to her repose, as
any other stratagem she could invent. But Mrs.
Grizzle's health was no sooner restored, than the
other being as much incommoded as ever, was
obliged, in her own defence, to have recourse to
some other contrivance; and managed her artifi∣ces
in such a manner, as leaves it at this day a
doubt whether she was really so whimsical and
capricious in her appetites as she herself pretended
to be; for her longings were not restricted to the
demands of the palate and stomach, but also af∣fected
all the other organs of sense, and even in∣vaded
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
her imagination, which at this period
seemed to be strangely diseased.</P>
<P>One time she longed to pinch her husband's
ear; and it was with infinite difficulty that his sis∣ter
could prevail upon him to undergo the ope∣ration.
Yet this task was easy, in comparison
with another she undertook for the gratification
of Mrs. Pickle's unaccountable desire; which was
no other than to persuade the commodore to sub∣mit
his chin to the mercy of the big-bellied lady,
who ardently wished for an opportunity of pluck∣ing
three black hairs from his beard. When this
proposal was first communicated to Mr. Trun∣nion
by the husband, his answer was nothing but
a dreadful effusion of oaths, accompanied with
such a stare, and delivered in such a tone of voice,
as terrified the poor beseecher into immediate
silence; so that Mrs. Grizzle was fain to take the
whole enterprize upon herself, and next day went
to the garrison accordingly, where having obtained
entrance by means of the lieutenant, who, while
his commander was asleep, ordered her to be ad∣mitted
for the joke's sake, she waited patiently
till he turned out, and then accosted him in the
yard, where he used to perform his morning
walk. He was thunder-struck at the appearance
of a woman in a place which he had hitherto
kept sacred from the whole sex, and immediately
began to utter an apostrophe to Tom Pipes, whose
turn it was then to watch; when Mrs. Grizzle
falling on her knees before him, conjured him
with many pathetic supplications, to hear and
grant her request, which was no sooner signified,
than he bellowed in such an outragious manner,
that the whole court re-ecchoed the opprobrious
term <HI>bitch</HI>; and the word <HI>damnation</HI> which he
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
repeated with surprising volubility, without any
sort of propriety or connection; and retreated
into his penetralia, leaving the baffled devotee in
the humble posture she had so unsuccessfully
chosen to melt his obdurate heart.</P>
<P>Mortifying as this repulse must have been to a
lady of her stately disposition, she did not relinquish
her aim, but endeavoured to interest the commo∣dore's
counsellors and adherents in her cause. With
this view she sollicited the interest of Mr. Hatch∣way,
who being highly pleased with a circum∣stance
in all probability so productive of mirth
and diversion, readily entered into her measures,
and promised to employ his whole influence for
her satisfaction: and as for the boatswain's mate,
he was rendered propitious by the present of a
guinea which she slipt into his hand. In short,
Mrs. Grizz'e was continually engaged in this
negotiation for the space of ten days, during
which the commodore was so incessantly pes∣tered
with her remonstrances, and the admoni∣tions
of his associates, that he swore his people
had a design upon his life, which becoming a
burthen to him, he at last complied, and was
conducted to the scene like a victim to the altar,
by the exulting priests; or rather growling like
a reluctant bear, when he is led to the stake
amidst the shouts and cries of butchers and their
dogs. After all, this victory was not quite so de∣cisive
as the conquerors imagined; for the patient
being set, and the performer prepared with a pair
of pincers, a small difficulty occurred: she could
not for some time discern one black hair on the
whole superficies of Mr. Trunnion's face; when
Mrs. Grizzle, very much alarmed and discon∣certed,
had recourse to a magnifying glass that
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
stood upon her toilette; and after a most accurate
examination, discovered a fibre of a dusky hue,
to which the instrument being applied, Mrs.
Pickle pulled it up by the roots, to the no small
discomposure of the owner, who feeling the
smart much more severe than he had expected,
started up, and swore he would not part with
another hair to save them all from damnation.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatchway exhorted him to patience and
resignation, Mrs. Grizzle repeated her intreaties
with great humility; but finding him deaf to all
her prayers, and absolutely bent upon leaving the
house, she clasped his knees, and begged for the
love of God that he would have compassion upon
a distressed family, and endure a little more for
the sake of the poor infant, who would other∣wise
be born with a grey beard upon its chin.
Far from being melted, he was rather exasperated
by this reflection; to which he replied with great
indignation, “Damn ye for a yaw-sighted bitch!
he'll be hanged long enough before he has any
beard at all:” so saying, he disengaged himself
from her embraces, flung out at the door, and
halted homewards with such surprising speed,
that the lieutenant could not overtake him until
he had arrived at his own gate; and Mrs. Griz∣zle
was so much affected with his escape, that
her sister, in pure compassion, desired she would
not afflict herself, protesting that her own wish
was already gratified, for she had plucked three
hairs at once, having from the beginning been
dubious of the commodore's forbearance. But
the labours of this affiduous kinswoman did not
end with the atchievement of this adventure: her
eloquence or industry were employed without
ceasing, in the performance of other tasks im∣posed
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
by the ingenious craft of her sister-in-law,
who at another time conceived an insuppressible
affection for a fricassee of frogs, which should be
the genuine natives of France; so that there was
a necessity for dispatching a messenger on purpose
to that kingdom: but as she could not depend
upon the integrity of any common servant, Mrs.
Grizzle undertook that province, and actually
set fail in a cutter for Bologne, from whence she
returned in eight and forty hours with a tub full
of those live animals, which being dressed accord∣ing
to art, her sister would not taste them, on
pretence that her fit of longing was past: but
then her inclinations took a different turn, and
fixed themselves upon a curious implement be∣longing
to a lady of quality in the neighbourhood,
which was reported to be a very great curiosity;
this was no other than a porcelain chamber-pot of
admirable workmanship, contrived by the honour∣able
owner, who kept it for her own private use,
and cherished it as an utensil of inestimable value.</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle shuddered at the first hint she re∣ceived
of her sister's desire to possess this piece of
furniture; because she knew it was not to be
purchashed; and the lady's character, which was
none of the most amiable in point of humanity
and condescension, forbad all hopes of borrowing
it for a season; she therefore attempted to reason
down this capricious appetite, as an extravagance
of imagination which ought to be combated and
repressed; and Mrs. Pickle, to all appearance,
was convinced and satisfied by her arguments and
advice: but nevertheless, could make use of no
other convenience, and was threatened with a
very dangerous suppression. Rouzed at the peril
in which she supposed her to be, Mrs. Grizzle
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
flew to the lady's house, and having obtained a
private audience, disclosed the melancholy situa∣tion
of her sister, and implored the benevolence
of her ladyship, who, contrary to expectation,
received her very graciously, and consented to in∣dulge
Mrs. Pickle's longing: but, as she had not
the pleasure of being acquainted with the family,
she hoped it would not be taken amiss, if she in∣sisted
upon security for her own indemnification,
in case any accident should happen to the machine
while under their protection. Overjoyed at this
condescension, Mrs. Grizzle was loud in her ac∣knowledgments,
embraced the terms of the loan,
in consequence of which, an hundred guineas
were deposited, and brought home this illustrious
Jordan, with as much pleasure and satisfaction, as
the Argonauts enjoyed when they made them∣selves
masters of the golden fleece. True it is,
her success was attended with a small disaster,
which she could not possibly foresee: next day it
was, at the desire of Mrs. Pickle, committed to
the charge of a trusty servant, who, in carrying
it back to the right owner, had the misfortune to
be overturned by one of her ladyship's valets who
ran against him in the court; and this superb piece
of porcelain falling upon the pavement, was
dashed into a thousand pieces. In vain did the
poor carrier urge his own innocence, by represent∣ing
the true cause of this misadventure; her lady∣ship
was deaf to all his proofs and protestations,
and without any ceremony, detained the pledge
which had been left in her hands; not without
violent suspicion of having acted as the auxiliary
of chance, to which this calamity was imputed.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, Mr. Pickle began to be out of
humour at the expence to which he was exposed
<PB N="43" REF="51"/>
by the caprice of his wife, who was herself
alarmed at this last accident, and for the future
kept her fancy within bounds, insomuch, that
without being subject to any more extraordinary
trouble, Mrs. Grizzle reaped the long wished
fruits of her dearest expectation in the birth of a
fine boy, whom her sister in a few months brought
into the world.</P>
<P>I shall omit the description of the rejoicings,
which were infinite on this important occasion,
and only observe that Mrs. Pickle's mother and
aunt stood godmothers, and the commodore as∣sisted
at the ceremony as godfather to the child,
who was christened by the name of Peregrine,
in compliment to the memory of a deceased un∣cle.
While the mother was confined to her bed,
and incapable of maintaining her own authority,
Mrs. Grizzle took charge of the infant by a dou∣ble
claim; and superintended with surprizing vi∣gilance
the nurse and midwife in all the particu∣lars
of their respective offices, which were per∣formed
by her express direction. But no sooner
was Mrs. Pickle in a condition to re-assume the
management of her own affairs, than she thought
proper to alter certain regulations concerning the
child, which had obtained in consequence of her
sister's orders, directing, among other innovati∣ons,
that the bandages with which the infant had
been so neatly rolled up, like an Aegyptian mum∣my,
should be loosened and laid aside, in order to
rid nature of all restraint, and give the blood free
scope to circulate; and with her own hands she
plunged him headlong every morning in a tub-full
of cold water. This operation seemed so barba∣rous
to the tender-hearted Mrs. Grizzle, that she
not only opposed it with all her eloquence, shed∣ding
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
abundance of tears over the sacrifice when
it was made; but took horse immediately, and
departed for the habitation of an eminent country
physician, whom she consulted in these words.
“Pray, doctor, is it not both dangerous and
cruel to be the means of letting a poor tender in∣fant
perish, by sousing it in water as cold as ice?”
“Yes, replied the doctor, downright murder, I
affirm.” “I see you are a person of great learn∣ing
and sagacity, said the other; and I must beg
you will be so good as to signify your opinion
in your own hand-writing.” The doctor imme∣diately
complied with her request, and expressed
himself upon a slip of paper to this purpose.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>These are to certify whom it may concern, that
I firmly believe, and it is my unalterable opi∣nion,
that whosoever letteth an infant perish, by
sousing it in cold water, even though the said water
should not be so cold as ice, is in effect, guilty of
the murder of the said infant, as witness my hand</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Comfit Colocynth.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having obtained this certificate, for which the
physician was handsomely acknowledged, she re∣turned
in triumph, hoping, with such authority,
to overthrow all opposition; and accordingly next
morning, when her nephew was about to under∣go
his diurnal baptism, produced the commission,
whereby she conceived herself impowered to over∣rule
such inhuman proceedings. But she was dis∣appointed
in her expectation, confident as it was;
not that Mrs. Pickle pretended to differ in opi∣nion
from Dr. Colocynth, “for whose character
and sentiments (said she) I have such veneration,
that I shall carefully observe the caution implied
in this very certificate, by which, far from con∣demning
my method of practice, he only asserts
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
that killing is murder; an asseveration, the truth
of which, it is to be hoped, I shall never dispute.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle, who, sooth to say, had rather
too superficially considered the clause by which
she thought herself authorized, perused the paper
with more accuracy, and was confounded at her
own want of penetration. Yet, though she was
confuted, she was by no means convinced that
her objections to the cold bath were unreason∣able;
on the contrary, after having bestowed
sundry opprobrious epithets on the physician, for
his want of knowledge and candour, she pro∣tested
in the most earnest and solemn manner
against the pernicious practice of dipping the
child; a piece of cruelty, which with God's as∣sistance,
she should never suffer to be inflicted on
her own issue; and washing her hands of the me∣lancholy
consequence that would certainly ensue,
shut herself up in her closet, to indulge her sor∣row
and vexation. She was deceived, however,
in her prognostic; the boy, instead of declining
in point of health, seemed to acquire fresh vigour
from every plunge, as if he had been resolved to
discredit the wisdom and foresight of his aunt,
who, in all probability, could never forgive
him for this want of reverence and respect. This
conjecture is founded upon her behaviour to
him in the sequel of his infancy, during which
she was known to torture him more than once,
when she had opportunities of thrusting pins into
his flesh, without any danger of being detected.
In a word, her affections were in a little time
altogether alienated from this hope of her family,
whom she abandoned to the conduct of his mo∣ther,
whose province it undoubtedly was to ma∣nage
the nurture of her own child; while she
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
herself resumed her operations upon the commo∣dore,
whom she was resolved at any rate to cap∣tivate
and inslave. And it must be owned, that
Mrs. Grizzle's knowledge of the human heart
never shone so conspicuous as in the methods
she pursued for the accomplishment of this im∣portant
aim.</P>
<P>Through the rough unpolished husk that cased
the soul of Trunnion, she could easily distinguish
a large share of that vanity and self-conceit that
generally predominate even in the most savage
breast; and to this she constantly appealed. In
his presence she always exclaimed against the
craft and dishonest dissimulation of the world;
and never failed of uttering particular invectives
against those arts of chicanry, in which the law∣yers
are so conversant to the prejudice and ruin
of their fellow creatures: observing that in a sea∣faring
life, so far as she had opportunities of judg∣ing
or being informed, there was nothing but
friendship, sincerity, and a hearty contempt for
every thing that was mean or selfish.</P>
<P>This kind of conversation, with the assistance
of certain particular civilities, insensibly made an
impression on the mind of the commodore; and
that the more effectual, as his former prepossessi∣ons
were built upon very flender foundations:
his antipathy to old maids, which he had con∣ceived
upon hearsay, began gradually to diminish,
when he found they were not quite such in∣fernal
animals as they had been represented; and
it was not long; before he was heard to observe at
the club, that Pickle's sister had not so much of
the core of bitch in her as he had imagined.
This negative compliment, by the medium of
her brother, soon reached the ears of Mrs. Griz∣zle,
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
who thus encouraged, redoubled all her arts
and attention; so that in less than three months
after, he in the same place distinguished her with
the epithet of a damned sensible jade.</P>
<P>Hatchway taking the alarm at this declaration,
which he feared foreboded something fatal to his
interest, told his commander with a sneer, that
she had sense enough to bring him to, under her
stern; and he did not doubt but that such an old
crazy vessel would be the better for being taken
in tow. “But howsomever, added this arch ad∣viser,
I'd have you take care of your upper works;
for if once you are made fast to her poop, agad!
she'll spank it away, and make every beam in
your body crack with straining.” Our she-pro∣jector's
whole plan had like to have been ruined
by the effect which this malicious hint had upon
Trunnion, whose rage and suspicion being wak∣ened
at once, his colour changed from tawny to
a cadaverous pale, and then shifting to a deep and
dusky red, such as we sometimes observe in the
sky when it is replete with thunder, he after his
usual preamble of unmeaning oaths, answered in
these words. “Damn ye, you jury-legg'd dog,
you would give all the stowage in your hold to be
as sound as I am; and as for being taken in tow,
d'ye see, I'm not so disabled but that I can lie my
course, and perform my voyage without any as∣sistance;
and, agad! no man shall ever see
Hawser Trunnion lagging a-stern in the wake of
e'er a bitch in christendom.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Grizzle, who every morning interrogated
her brother with regard to the subjeot of his
night's conversation with his friends, soon re∣ceived
the unwelcome news of the commodore's
aversion to matrimony; and justly imputing the
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
greatest part of his disgust to the satyrical insi∣nuations
of Mr. Hatchway, resolved to level this
obstruction to her success, and actually found
means to interest him in her scheme. She had
indeed, on some occasions, a particular knack at
making converts, being probably not unacquainted
with that grand system of persuasion, which is
adopted by the greatest personages of the age, as
fraught with maxims much more effectual than
all the eloquence of Tully or Demosthenes, even
when supported by the demonstrations of truth:
besides, Mr. Hatchway's fidelity to his new ally,
was confirmed by his foreseeing in his captain's
marriage an infinite fund of gratification for his
own cynical disposition. Thus, therefore, con∣verted
and properly cautioned, he for the future
suppressed all the virulence of his wit against the
matrimonial state; and as he knew not how to
open his mouth in the positive praise of any per∣son whatever, took all opportunities of excepting
Mrs. Grizzle by name, from the censures he li∣berally
bestowed upon the rest of her sex. “ She
is not a drunkard, like Nan Castick of Deptsord,
he would say; nor a nincompoop, like Peg Sim∣per
of Woolwich; nor a brimstone, like Klate
Coddle of Chatham; nor a shrew, like Nell Grif∣fin
on the Point Portsmouth;”' (ladies to whom at
different times, they had both paid their addresses)
but a tight, good humoured sensible wench, who
knows very well how to. box her compass; well
trimmed alost, and well shcathed alow, with a
good commodity under her hatches.” The com∣modore
at first imagined this commendation was
ironical, but hearing it repeated again and again,
was filled with astonishment at this surprising
change in the lieutenant's behaviours and after a
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
long fit of musing, concluded that Hatchway
himself harboured a matrimonial design on the
person of Mrs. Grizzle.</P>
<P>Pleased with this conjecture, he rallied Jack in
his turn, and one night toasted her health as a
compliment to his passion; a circumstance which
the lady learning next day by the usual canal of
her intelligence, and interpreting as the result of
his own tenderness for her, she congratulated
herself upon the victory she had obtained; and
thinking it unnecessary to continue the reserve
she had hitherto industriously affected, resolved
from that day to sweeten her behaviour towards
him with such a dash of affection, as could not
fail to persuade him that he had inspired her with
a reciprocal flame. In consequence of this de∣termination
he was invited to dinner, and while
he staid, treated with such cloying proofs of her
regard, that not only the rest of the company,
but even Trunnion himself perceived her drist;
and taking the alarm accordingly, could not help
exclaiming, “Oho! I see how the land lies, and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
I don't weather the point, I'll be clamn'd.”
Having thus expressed himself to his afflicted ina∣morata,
he made the best of his way to the gar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son,
in which he shut himself up for the spacc of
ten days, and had no communication with his
friends and domesticks but by looks, which were
most significantly picturesque.</P>

<P>THIS abrupt departure and unkind declara∣tion
affected Mrs. Grizzle so much, that
she sell sick of sorrow and mortification; and after
having confined herself to her bed for three days,
sent for her brother, told him she perceived her

Mr. Pickle surprised at her demand, began to act
the part of a comforter, assuring her that her
distemper was not at all dangerous; and that he
would instantly send for a physician, who would
convince her that she was in no manner of jeo∣pardy;
so that there was no occasion at present,
to employ any officious attorney in such a melan∣choly
task. Indeed, this affectionate brother wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of opinion that a will was altogether superfluous
at any rate, as he himself was heir at law to his
sister's whole real and personal estate. But she
insisted upon his compliance with such determined

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elish this testimony of her love, nevertheless th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
same evening gave an account of this particular
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
to Mr. Hatchway, who was also, as Mr. Pickle
assured him, generously remembered by the testa∣strix.</P>
<P>The lieutenant fraught with this piece of intel∣ligence,
watched for an opportunity, and as soon
as he perceived the commodore's features a little
unbended from that ferocious contraction they had
suffered so long, ventured to inform him that
Pickle's sister lay at the point of death, and that
she had left him a thousand pounds in her will.
This piece of news overwhelmed him with con∣fusion,
and Mr. Hatchway imputing his silence
to remorse, resolved to take advantage of that
favourable moment, and counselled him to go
and visit the poor young woman, who was dying
for love of him. But his admonition happened
to be somewhat unseasonable; for Trunnion no
sooner heard him mention the cause of her disor∣der
than his morosity recurring, he burst out
into a violent fit of cursing, and forthwith betook
himself again to his hammock, where he lay ut∣tering
in a low growling tone of voice, a repeti∣tion
of oaths and imprecations, for the space of
four and twenty hours, without ceasing. This
was a delicious meal to the lieutenant, who eager
to inhance the pleasure of the entertainment still
more, and at the same time conduce to the suc∣cess
of the cause he had espoused, invented a
stratagem, the execution of which had all the ef∣fect
he could desire. He prevailed upon Pipes,
who was devoted to his servicc, to get upon the
top of the chimney belonging to the commodore's
chamber, at midnight, and to lower down by a rope
a bunch of stinkina whitings, which being perso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed,
he put a speaking-trumpet to his mouth, and
hollowed down the next, in a voice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thunder,
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
“Trunnion! Trunnion! turn out and be spliced,
or lie still and be damned.” This dreadful note,
the terror of which was increased by the silencc
and darkness of the night, as well as the eccho of
the passage through which it was conveyed, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sooner reached the ears of the astonished commo∣dore,
than turning his eye towards the place from
whence this solemn address seemed to proceed,
he beheld a glittering object that vanished in an
instant; and just as his superstitious fear had im∣proved
the apparition into some supernatural mes∣senger
cloathed in shining array, his opinion was
confirmed by a sudden explosion, which he took
for thunder, though it was no other than the
noise of a pistol fired down the chimney by the
boatswain'a mate, according to the instructions
he had received; and he had time enough to de∣scend before he was in any danger of being de∣tected
by his commander, who could not for a
whole hour recollect himself from the amazement
and consternation which had overpowered his sa∣culties.</P>
<P>At length, however, he got up and rung his
bell with great agitation. He repeated the sum∣mons more than once, but no regard being paid
to this alarm, his dread returned with double ter∣ror,
a cold sweet bedewed his limbs, his knees
knocked together, his hair bristled up, and the
remains of his teeth were shattered to pieces in
the convulsive vibrations of his jaws.</P>
<P>In the midst of this agony he made one despe∣rate effort, and bursting open the door of his
apartment, bolted into Hatchway's chamber,
which happened to be on the same floor; and
there found the lieutenant in a counterfeit swoon,
who pretended to wake from his trance in an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ja∣culation
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
of “Lord have mercy upon us!”<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
being questioned by the terrified commodore with
regard to what had: appened, assured him he had
heard the same voice ard clap of thunder by
which Trunnion himself had been discomposed.</P>
<P>Pipes, whose turn it was to watch, concurred
in giving evidence to the same purpose; and the
commodore not only owned that he had heard
the voice, but likewise communicated hu vision,
with all the aggravation which his disturbed fancy
suggested.</P>
<P>A consultation immediately ensued, in which
Mr. Hatchway very gravely observed, that the
finger of God was plainly perceivable in those sig∣nals;
and that it would be both sinful and foolish
to disregard his commands, especially as the match
proposed was, in all respects, more advantage∣ous
than any that one of his years and infirmities
could reasonably expect; declaring that for his
own part he would not endanger his soul and
body by living one day longer under the same
roof with a man who despised the holy will of
heaven; and Tom Pipes adhered to the same
pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us resolution.</P>
<P>Trunnion's perseverance could not resist the
number and diversity of considerations that as∣saulted
it; he revolved in silence all the opposite
motives that occurred to his reflection; and after
having been, to all appearance, bewildered in the
labyrinth of his own thoughts, he wiped the sweat
from his forehead, and heaving a piteous groan,
yielded to their remonstrances in these words:
“Well, since it must be so, I think we must
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'en grapple. But damn my eyes! “'tis a damn'd
hard case that a fellow of my years should be
compelled, dye see, to beat up to windward all
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
the rest of his life, against the current of his own
inclination.”</P>
<P>This important article being discussed, Mr.
Hatchway set out in the morning to visit the de∣spairing
shepherdess, and was handsomely re∣warded
for the enlivening tidings with which he
blessed her ears. Sick as she was, she could not
help laughing heartily at the contrivance, in
consequence of which her swain's assent had been
obtained, and gave the lieutenant ten guineas for
Tom Pipes, in consideration of the part he acted
in the farce.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the commodore suffered
himself to be conveyed to her apartment, like a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elon to execution, and was received by her in a
languishing manner and genteel dishabille, ac∣companied
by her sister-in law; who was, for
very obvious reasons, extremely sollicitous about
her success. Though the lieutenant had tutored
him touching his behaviour at this interview, he
made a thousand wry faces before he could pro∣nounce
the simple salutation of <HI>How d'ye?</HI> to his
mistress; and after his counsellor had urged him
with twenty or thirty whispers, to each of which
he had replied aloud, “Damn your eyes I won't,”
he got up, and halting towards the couch on
which Mrs. Grizzle reclined in a state of strange
expectation, he seized her hand and pressed it to
his lips; but this piece of gallantry he performed
in such a reluctant, uncouth, indignant manner,
that the nymph had need of all her resolution to
endure the compliment without shrinking; and
he himself was so disconcerted at what he had
done, that he instantly retired to the other end of
the room, where he sat silent, and broiled with
shame and vexation. Mrs, Pickle, like a sensible
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
matron, quitted the place, on pretence of going
to the nursery; and Mr. Hatchway taking the
hint, recollected that he had lest his tobacco pouch
in the parlour, whither he immediately descendedy,
leaving the two lovers to their mutual endear∣ments.
Never had the commodore found himself
in such a disagreeable dilemma before. He sat in
an agony of suspence, as if he every moment
dreaded the dissolution of nature; and the implor∣ing
sighs of his future bride added, if possible,
to the pangs of his distress. Impatient of his
situation, he rolled his eye around in quest of
some relief, and unable to contain himself, ex∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>almed,
“Damnation seize the fellow and his
pouch too! I believe he. has sheered off, and left
me here in the stays. ” Mrs.Grizzle, who could
not help taking some notice of this manifestation
of chagrin, lamented her unhappy fate in being
so disagreeable to him that he could not put up
with her company for a few moments without
rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning; and began in very tender terms to re∣proach
him with his inhumanity and indifference.
To this expostulation he replied, “Zounds!
what would the woman have? let the parson do
his office when he wool, here I am ready to be
reeved in the matrimonial block, d'ye see, and
damn all nonsensical palaver.” So saying, he re∣treated,
leaving his mistress not at all disobliged
at his plain-dealing. That same evening the treaty
of marriage was brought upon the carpet, and by
means of Mr. Pickle and the lieutenant settled
to the satisfaction, of all parties, without the inter∣vention
of lawyers, whom Mr. Trunnion ex∣pressly
excluded from all share in the business;
making that condition the indispensible prelimi∣nary
of the whole agreement. Things being
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
brought to this bearing, Mrs. Grizzle's heart di∣lated
with joy; her health, which by the bye
was never dangerously impaired, she recovered as
if by inchantment, and a day being fixed for the
nuptials, employed the short period of her celi∣bacy
in choosing ornaments for the celebration of
her entrance into the married state.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Preparations are made for the commodore's wed∣ding,
which is delayed by an accident that hur∣ried
him the Lord knows whither.</HEAD>
<P>THE fame of this extraordinary conjunction
spread all over the county; and on the
day appointed for their spousals, the church was
surrounded by an inconceivable multitude. The
commodore, to give a specimen of his gallantry,
by the advice of his friend Hatchway, resolved
to appear on horseback on the grand occasion, at
the head of all his male attendants, whom he had
rigged with the white shirts and black caps for∣merly
belonging to his barge's crew; and he
bought a couple of hunters for the accommoda∣tion
of himfelf and his lieutenant. With this
equipage then he set out from the garrison for the
church, after having dispatched a messenger to
apprize the bride that he and his company were
mounted; whereupon she got immediately into
the coach, accompanied by her brother and his
wife, and drove directly to the place of assigna∣tion,
where several pew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were demolised, and
divers persons almost pressed to death, by the ea∣gerness
of the crowd that broke in to see the ce∣remony
performed. Thus arrived at the altar,
and the priest in attendance, they waited a whole
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
half hour for the commodore, at whose slowness
they began to be under some apprehension, and
accordingly dismissed a servant to quicken his
pace. The valet having rode something more
than a mile, espied the whole troop disposed in a
long field, crossing the road obliquely, and headed
by the bridegroom and his friend Hatchway, who
finding himself hindered by a hedge from pro∣ceeding
farther in the same direction, fired a
pistol, and stood over to the other side, making
an obtuse angle with the line of his former course;
and the rest of the squadron followed his exam∣ple,
keeping always in the rear of each other,
like a flight of wild geese.</P>
<P>Surprized at this strange method of journeying,
the mesenger came up, and told the commodore
that his lady and her company expected him in
the church, where they had tarried a considerable
time, and were beginning to be very uneasy at his
dealy; and therefore defired he would proceed
with more expedition. To this message Mr.
Trunnion replied, “Hark ye, brother, don't
you see we make all possible speed? go back and
tell those who sent you, that the wind has shifted
since we weighed anchor, and that we are obliged
to make very short trips in tacking, by reason of
the narrowness of the channel; and that as we
he within six points of the wind, they must
make some allowance for variation and leeway.”
“Lord, Sir! said the vale<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, what occasion have
you to go zig zag in that manner? Do but clap
spurs to your houses, and ride straight forward,
and I'11 engage you shall be at the church porch
in less than a quarter of an hour.” “What!
right in the wind's eye? answered the commander,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey! brother, where did you learn your naviga∣tion?
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
Hawser Trunnion is not to be taught at
this time of day how to lie his course, or keep
his own reckoning. And as for you, brother,
you know best the trim of your own frigate.”
The courier finding he had to do with people
who would not be easily persuaded out of their
own opinions, returned to the temple, and made a
report of what he had seen and heard, to the no
small consolation of the bride, who had begun to
discover some signs of disquiet. Composed, how∣ever,
by this piece of intelligence, she exerted her
patience for the space of another half hour, dur∣ing
which period seeing no bridegroom arrive,
she was exceedingly alarmed; so that all the spec∣tators
could easily perceive her perturbation, which
manifested itself in frequent palpitations, heart∣heavings,
and alterations of countenance, in spite
of the assistance of a smelling-bottle which she
incessantly applied to her nostrils.</P>
<P>Various were the conjectures of the company
on this occasion; some imagined he had mistaken
the place of rendezvous, as he had never been at
church since he first settled in that parish; others
believed he had met with some accident, in con∣sequence
of which his attendants had carried him
back to his own house; and a third set, in which
the bride herself was thought to be comprehended,
could not help suspecting that the commodore had
changed his mind. But all these suppositions,
ingenious as they were, happened to be wide of
the true cause that detained him, which was no
other than this: the commodore and his crew
had by dint of turning, almost weathered the
parson's house that stood to windwa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of the
church, when the notes of a pack of hounds un∣luckily
reached the ears of the two hunters which
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
Trunnion and the lieutenant bestrode. These fleet
animals no sooner heard the enlivening sound,
than eager for the chace they sprung away all of a
sudden, and straining every nerve to partake of
the sport, flew across the fields with incredible
speed, overleaping hedges and ditches, and every
thing in their way, without the least regard to
their unfortunate riders. The lieutenant, whose
steed had got the heels of the other, finding it
would be great folly and presumption in him to
pretend to keep the saddle with his wooden leg,
very wisely took the opportunity of throwing
himself off in his passage through a field of rich
clover, among which he lay at his ease; and
seeing his captain advancing at full gallop, hailed
him with the salutation of “What chear? ho!”
The commodore, who was in infinite distress, eying
him askance, as he passed, replied with a faul∣tering
voice, “O damn ye! you are safe at an
anchor; I wish to God I were as fast moored.”
Nevertheless, conscious of his disabled heel, he
would not venture to try the same experiment
which had succeeded so well with Hatchway, but
resolved to stick as close as possible to his horse's
back, until providence should interpose in his be∣half.
With this view he dropped his whip, and
with his right hand laid fast hold on the pummel,
contracting every muscle in his body to secure
himself in the seat, and grinning most formidably,
in consequence of this exertion. In this attitude
he was hurried on a considerable way, when all
of a sudden his view was comforted by a five bar
gate that appeared before him, as he never doubt∣ed
that there the career of his hunter must ne∣cessarily
end. But, alas! he reckoned without his
host; far from halting at this obstruction, tho
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
horse sprung over it with amazing agility, to the
utter confusion and disorder of his owner, who
lost his hat and periwig in the leap, and now be∣gan
to think in good earnest, that he was actually
mounted on the back of the devil. He recom∣mended
himself to God, his reflection forsook
him, his eye-sight and all his other senses failed,
he quitted the reins, and fastening by instinct on
the mane, was in this condition conveyed into the
midst of the sportsmen, who were astonished at
the sight of such an apparition. Neither was their
surprize to be wondered at, if we reflect on the
figure that presented itself to their view. The
commodore's person was at all times an object of
admiration; much more so on this occasion,
when every singularity was aggravated by the cir∣cumstances
of his dress and disaster.</P>
<P>He had put on in honour of his nuptials his best
cont of blue broad cloth, cut by a taylor of Rams∣gate,
and trimmed with five dozen of brass but∣tons,
large and small; his breeches were of the
same piece, fastened at the knees with large
bunches of tape; his waistcoat was of red plu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elled with green velvet, and garnished with
velium holes; his boots bore an intimate resem∣blance
both in colour and shape to a pair of lea∣thern
buckets; his shoulder was graced with a
broad buff belt, from whence depended a huge
hanger with a hil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> like that of a backsword; and
on each side of his pummel appeared a rusty pis∣tol
rammed in a case covered with bear-skin.
The loss of his tye-periwig and laced hat, which
were curiosities of the kind, did not at all contri∣bute
to the improvement of the picture, but on
the contrary, by exhibiting his bald pate, and the
natural extension of his lanthorn jaws, added to
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
the peculiarity and extravagance of the whole.
Such a spectacle could not have failed of di∣verting
the whole company from the chace, had
his horse thought proper to pursue a different
route, but the beast was too keen a sporter to
choose any other way than that which the stag
followed; and therefore, without stopping to gra∣tify
the curiosity of the spectators, he in a few mi∣nutes
outstripped every hunter in the field; and
there being a deep hollow way betwixt him and
the hounds, rather than ride round about the
length of a furlong to a path that crossed the lane,
he transported himself at one jump, to the un∣speakable
astonishment and terror of a waggoner
who chanced to be underneath, and saw this phe∣nomenon
fly over his carriage. This was not the
only adventure he atchieved. The stag having
taken a deep river that lay in his way, every man
directed his course to a bridge in the neigh∣bourhood;
but our bridegroom's courser despising
all such conveniences, plunged into the stream
without hesitation, and swam in a twinkling to
the opposite shore. This sudden immersion into
an element of which Trunnion was properly a
native, in all probability helped to recruit the
exhusted spirits of his rider, who at his landing
on the other side give some tokens of sensation,
by hollowing aloud for assistance, which he could
not possibly receive, because his horse still main∣tained
the advantage he had gained, and would
not allow himself to be overtaken.</P>
<P>In short, after a long chace that lasted several
hours, and extended to a dozen miles at least, he
was the first in at the death of the deer, being se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded
by the lieutenant's gelding, which actuated
<PB N="62" REF="70"/>
by the same spirit, had, without a rider, followed
his companion's example.</P>
<P>Our bridegroom finding himself at last brought
up, or in other words, at the end of his career,
took the opportunity of this first pause, to desire
the huntsmen would lend him a hand in dis∣mounting;
and was by their condescension safely
placed on the grass, where he sat staring at the
company as they came in, with such wildness of
astonishment in his looks, as if he had been a
creature of another species, dropt among them
from the clouds.</P>
<P>Before they had fleshed the hounds, however,
he recollected himself, and seeing one of the
sportsmen take a small flask out of his pocket and
apply it to his mouth, judged the cordial to be no
other than neat Coniac, which it really was; and
expressing a desire of participation, was immedi∣ately
accommodated with a moderate dose, which
perfectly compleated his recovery.</P>
<P>By this time he and his two horses had en∣grossed
the attention of the whole crowd; while
some admired the elegant proportion and un∣common
spirit of the two animals, the rest con∣templated
the surprising appearance of their ma∣ster,
whom before they had only seen <HI>en passant</HI>;
and at length, one of the gentlemen, accosting
him very courteously, signified his wonder at
seeing him in such an equipage, and asked if he
had not dropped his companion by the way.
“Why, look ye, brother, (replied the com∣modore)
mayhap you think me an odd sort of a
fellow, seeing me in this trim, especially as I
have lost part of my rigging; but this here is the
case, d'ye see: I weighed anchor from my own
house this morning at ten A.M. with fair wea∣ther,
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
and a favourable breeze at south south∣east,
being bound to the next church, on the
voyage of matrimony: but howsomever, we had
not run down a quarter of a league, when the
wind shifting, blowed directly in our teeth; so
that we were forced to tack all the way, d'ye see,
and had almost beat up within sight of port,
when these sons of bitches of horses, which I
had bought but two days before (for my own
part, I believe they are devils incarnate) luffed
round in a trice, and then refusing the helm,
drove away like lightning with me and my lieu∣tenant,
who soon came to anchor in an exceed∣ing
good birth. As for my own part, I have
been carried over rocks, and flats, and quick∣sands;
among which I have pitched away a spe∣cial
good tye-periwig, and an iron-bound hat;
and at last, thank God! am got into smooth wa∣ter
and safe riding: but if ever I venture my car∣case
upon such a hare'um scare'um blood of a
bitch again, my name is not Hawser Trunnion,
d—n my eyes!”</P>
<P>One of the company, struck with this name,
which he had often heard, immediately laid hold
on his declaration at the close of this singular ac∣count;
and observing that his horses were very
vicious, asked how he intended to return? “As
for that matter, (replied Mr. Trunnion) I am
resolved to hire a sledge or waggon, or such a
thing as a jack-ass; for I'll be d—n'd if ever I
cross the back of a horse again.” “And what
do you propose to do with these creatures? (said
the other, pointing to the hunters) they seem to
have some mettle; but then they are meer colts,
and will take the devil and all of breaking.
Methinks this hither one is shoulder slipped.”
<PB N="64" REF="72"/>
“Damn them, (cried the commodore) I wish
both their necks were broke, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the two cost
me forty good yellow-boys,” “Forty guineas!
(exclaimed the stranger, who was a squire and a
jocky, as well as owner of the pack) Lord!
Lord! how a man may be imposed upon! Why,
these cattle are clumsy enough to go to plow:
mind what a flat counter; do but observe how
sharp this here one is in the withers; then he's
fired in the further setlock.” In short, this con∣noisseur
in horse-flesh, having discovered in them
all the defects which can possibly be found in that
species of animals, offered to give him ten gui∣neas
for the two, saying, he would convert them
into beasts of burthen. The owner, who (after
what had happened) was very well disposed to
listen to any thing that was said to their preju∣dice,
implicitly believed the truth of the stran∣ger's
asseverations, discharged a furious volley
of oaths against the rascal who had taken him
in, and forthwith struck a bargain with the
squire, who paid him instantly for his purchase;
in consequence of which he won the plate at the
next Canterbury races.</P>
<P>This affair being transacted to the mutual sa∣tisfaction
of both parties, as well as to the gene∣ral
entertainment of the company, who laughed
in their sleeves at the dexterity of their friend,
Trunnion was set upon the squire's own horse,
and led by his servant in the midst of this caval∣cade,
which proceeded to a neighbouring village,
where they had bespoke dinner, and where our
bridegroom sound means to provide himself with
another hat and wig. With regard to his mar∣riage,
he bore his disappointment with the tem∣per
of a philosopher; and the exercise he had
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
undergone having quickened his appetite, sat
down at table in the midst of his new acquaint∣ance,
making a very hearty meal, and moistening
every morsel with a draught of the ale, which
he found very much to his satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is found by the lieutenant; reconducted to his
own house; married to Mrs Grizzle, who meets
with a small misfortune in the night, and asserts
her prerogative next morning; in consequence of
which her husband's eye is endangered.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while lieutenant Hatchway made
shift to hobble to the church, where he
informed the company of what had happened to
the commodore; and the bride behaved with
great decency on the occasion; for, as soon as
the understood the danger to which her future
husband was exposed, she fainted in the arms of
her sister-in-law, to the surprize of all the spec∣tators,
who could not comprehend the cause of
her disorder; and when she was recovered by
the application of smelling-bottles, earnestly
legged that Mr. Hatchway and Tom Pipes would
take her brother's coach, and go in quest of
their commander.</P>
<P>This task they readily undertook, being escorted
by all the rest of his adherents on horseback;
while the bride and her friends were invited to
the parson's house, and the ceremony deferred
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l another occasion.</P>
<P>The lieutenant, steering his course as near the
line of direction in which Trunnion went off as
the coach-road would permit, got intelligence of
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
his track from one farm-house to another; for
such an apparition could not fail of attracting par∣ticular
notice; and one of the horsemen having
picked up his hat and wig in a bye-path, the whole
troop entered the village where he was lodged,
about four o'clock in the afternoon. When they
understood he was safely housed at the George,
they rode up to the door in a body, and expressed
their satisfaction in three chears; which were re∣turned
by the company within, as soon as they
were instructed in the nature of the salute by
Trunnion, who by this time had entered into
all the jollity of his new friends, and was indeed
more than half seas over. The lieutenant was
introduced to all present as his sworn brother,
and had something t***ssed up for his dinner. Tom
Pipes and the crew were regaled in another room;
and a fresh pair of horses being put to the coach,
about six in the evening the commodore, with
all his attendants, depa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted for the garrison, after
having shook hands with every individual in the
house.</P>
<P>Without any farther accident he was con∣veyed
in safety to his own gate before nine, and
committed to the care of Pipes, who carried him
instantly to his hammock, while the lieutenant
was driven away to the place where the bride and
her friends remained in great anxiety, which va∣nished
when he assured them that his commodore
was safe, being succeeded by abundance of mirth
and pleasantry at the account he gave of Trun∣nion's
adventure.</P>
<P>Another day was fixed for the nuptials; and,
in order to baulk the curiosity of idle people,
which had given great offence, the parson was
prevailed upon to perform the ceremony in the
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
garrison, which all that day was adorned with
flags and pendants displayed, and at night illumi∣nated
by the direction of Hatchway, who also
ordered the patereroes to be fired as soon as the
marriage knot was tied. Neither were the other
parts of the entertainment neglected by this inge∣nious
contriver, who produced undeniable proofs
of his elegance and art in the wedding-supper,
which had been committed to his management
and direction. This general banquet was in∣tirely
composed of sea-dishes; a huge pillaw,
consisting of a large piece of beef sliced, a couple
of fowls, and half a peck of rice, smoaked in
the middle of the board: a dish of hard fish
swimming in oil appeared at each end, the sides
being furnished with a mess of that savoury com∣position
known by the name of lob's course, and
a plate of salmagundy. The second course dis∣played
a goose of a monstrous magnitude, flanked
with two Guinea hens, a pig barbecu'd, an hock
of salt pork in the midst of a pease-pudding, a
leg of mutton roasted, with potatoes, and another
boiled, with yam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. The third service was made
up of a loin of fresh pork with apple-sauce, a kid
smothered with onions, and a terrapin baked in
the shell: and last of all, a prodigious sea-pye
was presented, with an infinite volume of pan∣cakes
and fritters. That every thing might be
answerable to the magnificence of this delicate
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, he had provided vast quantities of strong
beer, flip, rumbo, and burnt brandy, with plenty
of Barbadoes water for the ladies; and hired all
the fiddles within six miles, who, with the addi∣tion
of a drum, bag-pipe, and Welch-harp, re∣galed
the guests with a most melodious concert.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="76"/>
The company, who were not at all exceptio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
seemed extremely well pleased with every parti∣cular
of the entertainment; and the evening be∣ing
spent in the most social manner, the bride
was by her sister conducted to her apartment,
where, however, a trifling circumstance had like
to have destroyed the harmony which had been
hitherto maintained.</P>
<P>I have already observed, that there was not
one standing bed within the walls; theresore the
reader will not wonder that Mrs. Trunnion
was out of humour, when she found herself un∣der
the necessity of being confined with her spouse
in a hammock, which tho' enlarged with a dou∣ble
portion of canvas, and dilated with a yoke
for the occasion, was at best but a disagreeable,
not to say dangerous situation. She accordingly
complained with some warmth of this inconve∣nience,
which she imputed to disrespect, and at
first absolutely refused to put up with the expe∣dient:
but Mrs. Pickle soon brought her to rea∣son
and compliance, by observing that one night
would soon be elapsed, and next day she might
regulate her own oeconomy.</P>
<P>Thus persuaded, she ventured into the vehicle,
and was visited by her husband in less than an
hour, the company being departed to their own
homes, and the garrison left to the command of
his lieutenant and mate. But it seems the hooks
that supported this swinging couch were not calcu∣lated
for the addition of weight which they were
now destined to bear; and therefore gave way in
the middle of the night, to the no small terror of
Mrs. Trunnion, who perceiving herself falling,
screamed aloud, and by that exclamation brought
Hatchway with a light into the chamber. Tho'
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
she had received no injury by the fall she was
extremely discomposed and incensed at the acci∣dent,
which she even openly ascribed to the ob∣stinacy
and whimsical oddity of the commodore,
in such petulant terms as evidently declared that
she thought her great aim accomplished, and her
authority secured against all the shocks of fortune.
Indeed her bedfellow seemed to be of the same
opinion, by his tacit resignation; for he made no
reply to her insinuations, but with a most vinegar
aspect crawled out of his nest, and betook him∣self
to rest in another apartment, while his irri∣tated
spouse dismissed the lieutenant, and from
the wreck of the hammock made an occasional
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for herself on the floor, fully determined to
provide better accommodation for next night's
lodging.</P>
<P>Having no inclination to sleep, her thoughts
during the remaining part of the night were en∣gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed
by a scheme of reformation she was re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved
to execute in the family; and no sooner
did the first lark bid salutation to the morn, than
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tarting from her humble couch, and huddling on
her cloaths, she sallied from her chamber, ex∣plored
her way thro' paths before unknown, and
in the course of her researches perceived a large
bell, to which she made such effectual application
as alarmed every soul in the family. In a mo∣ment
she was surrounded by Hatchway, Pipes,
and all the rest of the servants half dressed; but
seeing none of the feminine gender appear, she
began to storm at the sloth and laziness of the
maids, who, she observed, ought to have been
at work an hour at least before she called;
and then, for the first time, understood that no
woman was permitted to sleep within the walls.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="78"/>
She did not fail to exclaim against this regula∣tion;
and being informed that the cook and
chambermaid lodged in a small office-house that
stood without the gate, ordered the draw-bridge
to be let down, and in person beat up their
quarters, commanding them forthwith to set
about scouring the rooms, which had not been
hitherto kept in a very decent condition, while
two men were immediately employed to transport
the bed on which she used to lie from her bro∣ther's
house to her new habitation; so that, in
less than two hours, the whole oeconomy of the
garrison was turned topsy-turvy, and every thing
involved in such tumult and noise, that Trunnion
being disturbed and distracted with the uproar,
turned out in his shirt like a frantic maniac, and
arming himself with a cudgel of crab-tree, made
an irruption into his wife's apartment, where
perceiving a couple of carpenters at work, in
joining a bedstead, he, with many dreadful oaths
and opprobrious invectives, ordered them to de∣sist,
swearing he would suffer no bulk-heads nor
hurricane-houses to stand where he was master:
but finding his remonstrances disregarded by these
mechanics, who believed him to be some mad∣man
belonging to the family, who had broke
from his confinement, he assaulted them both
with great fury and indignation, and was handled
so roughly in the encounter, that in a very short
time he measured his length on the floor, in con∣sequence
of a blow that he received from a ham∣mer,
by which the sight of his remaining eye
was grievously endangered.</P>
<P>Having thus reduced him to a state of sub∣jection,
they resolved to secure him with cords,
and were actually busy in adjusting his fetters,
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
when he was exempted from the disgrace by
the accidental entrance of his spouse, who rescued
him from the hands of his adversaries, and, in
the midst of her condolance, imputed his misfor∣tune
to the inconfiderate roughness of his own
disposition.</P>
<P>He breathed nothing but revenge, and made
some efforts to chastis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the insolence of the work∣men,
who, as soon as they understood his qua∣lity,
asked forgiveness for what they had done
with great humility, protesting that they did not
know he was master of the house. But, far
from being satisfied with this apology, he groped
about for the bell, (the inflammation on his eye
having utterly deprived him of sight) and the
rope being, by the precaution of the delinquents,
conveyed out of his reach, began to storm with
incredible vociferation, like a lion roaring in the
toil, pouring forth innumerable oaths and exe∣crations,
and calling by name Hatchway and
Pipes, who being within hearing, obeyed the ex∣traordinary
summons, and were ordered to put
the carpenters in irons, for having audaciously
assaulted him in his own house.</P>
<P>His myrmidons seeing he had been evil-intreat∣ed,
were exasperated at the insult he had suffered,
which they considered as an affront upon the dig∣nity
of the garrison; the more so, as the muti∣neers
seemed to put themselves in a posture of
defence, and set their authority at defiance: they
therefore unsheathed their cutlasses, which they
commonly wore as badges of their commission;
and a desperate engagement, in all probability,
would have ensued, had not the lady of the castle
interposed, and prevented the effects of their
animosity, by assuring the lieutenant that the
<PB N="72" REF="80"/>
commodore had been the aggressor; and that the
workmen, finding themselves attacked in such an
extraordinary manner, by a person whom they
did not know, were obliged to act in their own
defence, by which he had received that unlucky
contusion.</P>
<P>Mr. Hatchway no sooner learnt the senti∣ments
of Mrs. Trunnion, than sheathing his in∣dignation,
he told the commodore he should always
be ready to execute his lawful commands; but
that he could not in conscience be concerned in
oppressing poor people who had been guilty of no
offence.</P>
<P>This unexpected declaration, together with the
behaviour of his wife, who in his hearing de∣sired
the carpenters to resume their work, filled
the breast of Trunnion with rage and mortifica∣tion.
He pulled off his woollen night-cap, pum∣melled
his bare pate, beat the floor alternately
with his feet, swore his people had betrayed him,
and cursed himself to the lowest pit of hell, for
having admitted such a cockatrice into his family.
But all these exclamations did not avail; they
were among the last essays of his resistance to
the will of his wife, whose influence among his
adherents had already swallowed up his own;
and who now peremptorily told him, that he
must leave the management of every thing within
doors to her, who understood best what was for
his honour and advantage. She then ordered a
poultice to be prepared for his eye, which being
applied, he was committed to the care of Pipes,
by whom he was led about the house like a blind
bear growling for prey, while his industrious
yoke-fellow executed every circumstance of the
plan she had projected; so that, when he re∣covered
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
his vision, he was an utter stranger in his
own house.</P>

the unspeakable joy of Trunnion, who neverthe∣less

<P>THESE innovations were not effected with∣out
many loud objections on his part; and
divers curious dialogues passed between him and
his yoke-fellow, who always came off victorious
from the dispute; insomuch that his countenance
gradually fell; he began to suppress, and at length
intirely devoured his chagrin; the terrors of su∣perior
authority were plainly perceivable in his
features, and in less than three months he be∣came
a thorough-paced husband. Not that his
obstinacy was extinguished, tho' overcome; in
some things he was as inflexible and muleish as
ever, but then he durst not kick so openly, and
was reduced to the necessity of being passive in
his resentments. Mrs. Trunnion, for example,
proposed that a coach and six should be pur∣chased,
as she could not ride on horseback, and
the chaise was a scandalous carriage for a person
of her condition; the commodore, conscious of
his own inferior capacity in point of reasoning,
did not think proper to dispute the proposal, but
lent a deaf ear to her repeated remonstrances,
tho' they were inforced with every argument
which she thought could sooth, terrify, shame or
decoy him into compliance: in vain did she urge
the excess of affection she had for him, as me∣riting
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
some return of tenderness and condescen∣sion;
he was even proof against certain menacing
hints she gave, touching the resentment of a
slighted woman; and he stood out against all the
considerations of dignity or disgrace, like a bul∣wark
of brass. Neither was he moved to any
indecent or unkind expressions of contradiction,
even when she upbraided him with his sordid dis∣position,
and put him in mind of the fortune and
honour he had acquired by his marriage, but
seemed to retire within himself, like a tortoise
when attacked, that shrinks within its shell, and
silently endure the scourge of her reproaches,
without seeming sensible of the smart.</P>
<P>This, however, was the only point in which she
had been baffled since her nuptials; and as she
could by no means digest the miscarriage, she
tortured her invention for some new plan by
which she might augment her influence and au∣thority:
what her genius refused was supplied
by accident; for she had not lived four months in
the garrison when she was seized with frequent
qualms and reachings, her breasts began to har∣den,
and her stomach to be remarkable promi∣nent:
in a word, she congratulated herself on
the symptoms of her own sertility, and the com∣modore
was transported with joy, at the prospect
of an heir of his own begetting.</P>
<P>She knew this was the proper season for vindi∣cating
her own sovereignty, and accordingly em∣ployed
the means which nature had put in her
power. There was not a rare piece of furniture
and apparel for which she did not long; and on
day as she went to church, seeing lady Stately
equipage arrive, she suddenly fainted away. Her
husband, whose vanity had never been so perfectly∣gratified
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
as with this promised harvest of his own
sowing, took the alarm immediately, and in or∣der
to prevent relapses of that kind, which might
be attended with fatal consequences to his hope,
gave her leave to bespeak a coach, horses and li∣veri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
to her own liking. Thus authorized, she
in a very little time exhibited such a specimen of
her own taste and magnificence as afforded specu∣lation
to the whole county, and made Trun∣nion's
heart quake within him, because he fore∣saw
no limits to her extravagance, which also
manifested itself in the most expensive prepara∣tions
for her lying in.</P>
<P>Her pride, which had hitherto regarded the re∣presentative
of her father's house, seemed now to
lose all that hereditary respect, and prompt her
to outshine and undervalue the elder branch of
her family. She behaved to Mrs. Pickle with a
sort of civil reserve that implied a conscious su∣periority,
and an emulation in point of grandeur
immediately commenced between the two sisters.
She every day communicated her importance to
the whole parish, under pretence of taking the air
in her coach, and endeavoured to extend her ac∣quaintance
among people of fashion. Nor was
this an undertaking attended with great difficulty,
for all persons whatever, capable of maintaining
a certain appearance, will always find admission
into what is called the best company, and be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated in point of character according to their own
valuation, without subjecting their pretensions to
the smallest doubt or examination. In all her vi∣sits
and parties she seized every opportunity of de∣claring
her present condition, observing that she
was forbid by her physicians to taste such a pickle,
and that such a dish was poison to a woman in her
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
way: nay, where she was on a footing of fa∣miliarity,
she affected to make wry faces, and
complained that the young rogue began to be very
unruly, writhing herself into divers contortions,
as if she had been grievously incommoded by the
mettle of this future Trunnion. The husband
himself did not behave with all the moderation
that might have been expected; at the club he
frequently mention'd this circumstance of his
own vigour as a pretty successful feat to be per∣formed
by an old fellow of fifty-five, and con∣firmed
the opinion of his strength by redoubled
squeezes of the landlord's hand, which never
failed of extorting a satisfactory certificate of his
might. When his companions drank to the <HI>Hans
en kelderr</HI>, or Jack in the low cellar, he could
not help displaying an extraordinary complacence
of countenance, and signified his intention of
sending the young dog to sea, as soon as he should
be able to carry a cartridge, in hopes of seeing
him an officer before his own death.</P>
<P>This hope helped to console him under the ex∣traordinary
expence to which he was exposed by
the profusion of his wife, especially when he con∣sidered
that his compliance with her prodigality
would be limited to the expiration of the nine
months, of which the best part was by this time
elapsed; yet in spite of all this philosophical re∣signation,
her fancy sometimes soared to such a
ridiculous and intolerable pitch of insolence and
absurdity, that his temper forsook him, and he
could not help wishing in secret, that her pride
might be confounded in the dissipation of her most
flattering hopes, even tho' he himself should be
a principal sufferer by the disappointment. These,
however, were no other than the suggestions of
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
temporary disgusts, that commonly subsided as
suddenly as they arose, and never gave the least
disturbance to the person who inspired them, be∣cause
he took care to conceal them carefully from
her knowledge.</P>
<P>Mean while she happily advanced in her reck∣oning,
with the promise of a favourable issue; the
term of her computation expired, and in the
middle of the night she was visited by certain
warnings that seemed to bespeak the approach of
the critical moment. The commodore got up
with great alacrity, and called the midwife, who
had been several days in the house; the gossips
were immediately summoned, and the most in∣teresting
expectations prevailed; but the symp∣toms
of labour gradually vanished, and, as the
matrons sagely observed, this was no more than
a false alarm.</P>
<P>Two nights after they received a second inti∣mation,
and as she was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ibly diminished in the
waist, every thing was supposed to be in a fair
way; yet this vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion was not more conclusive
than the former; her pains wore off in spite of
all her endeavours to encourage them, and the
good women betool themselves to their respective
homes, in expectation of finding the third attack
decisive, alluding to the well-known maxim, that
<HI>number three is always fortunate.</HI> For once,
however, this apothegm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed; the next call was
altogether as ineffectual as the former; and
moreover, attended with a phaenomenon which
to them was equally strange and inexplicable:
this was no other than such a reduction in the
size of Mrs. Trunnion as might have been ex∣pected
after the birth of a full-grown child.
Startled at such an unaccountable event, they sat
<PB N="78" REF="86"/>
in close divan; and concluding that the case was
in all respects unnatural and prodigious, desired
that a messenger might be immediately dispatched
for some male practitioner in the art of mid∣wisery.</P>
<P>The commodore, without guessing the cause
of their perplexity, ordered Pipes immediately on
this piece of duty; and in less than two hours
they were assisted by the advice of a surgeon of
the neighbourhood, who boldly affirmed that the
patient had never been with child. This asseve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was like a clap of thunder to Mr. Trun∣nion,
who had been during eight whole days and
nights in continual expectation of being hailed
with the appellation of father.</P>
<P>After some recollection he swore the sur∣geon
was an ignorant fellow, and that he would
not take his word for what he advanced, being
comforted and confirmed in his want of faith by
the insinuations of the midwise, who still, per∣sisted
to feed Mrs. Trunnion with hopes of a
speedy and safe delivery; observing that she had
been concerned in many a case of the same na∣ture,
where a fine child was found, even after
all signs of the mother's pregnancy had disap∣peared.
Every twig of hope, how slender so∣ever
it may be, is eagerly caught hold on by
people who find themselves in danger of being
disappointed. To every question proposed by her
to the lady with the preamble of “Han't you?”
or “Don't you?” an answer was made in the af∣firmative,
whether agreeable to truth or not, be∣cause
the respondent could not find in her heart
to disown any symptom that might savour the
notion she had so long indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="87"/>
This experienced proficient in the obstetric
art was therefore kept in close attendance for the
space of three weeks, during which the patient
had several returns of what she pleased herself
with believing to be labour-pains, till at length
she and her husband became the standing joke of
the parish; and this in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atuated couple could scarce
be prevailed upon to part with their hopes, even
when she appeared as lank as a greyhound, and
they were furnished with other unquestionable
proofs of their having been deceived. But they
could not for ever remain under the influence of
this sweet delusion, which at last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aded away, and
was succeeded by a paroxism of shame and con∣fusion,
that kept the husband within doors for the
space of a whole fortnight, and confined his lady
to her bed for a series of weeks, during which
she suffered all the anguish of the most intense
mortification; yet even this was subdued by the
lenient hand of time.</P>
<P>The first respite from her chagrin was em∣ployed
in the strict discharge of what are called the
duties of religion, which she performed with the
most rancorous severity, setting on foot a perse∣cution
in her own family, that made the house
too hot for all the menial servants, even ruffled
the almost invincible indifference of Tom Pipes,
harrassed the commodore himself out of all pa∣tience,
and spared no individual but lieutenant
Hatchway, whom she never ventured to dis∣oblige.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mrs. Trunnion erects a tyranny in the garrison,
while her husband conceives an affection for his
nephew Perry, who manifests a peculiarity of
disposition even in his tender years.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING exercised herself three months
in such pious amusements, she appeared
again in the world; but her misfortune had made
such an impression on her mind, that she could
not bear the sight of a child, and trembled when
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the conversation happened to turn upon a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Her temper, which was naturally
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the sweetest, seemed to have imbibed a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proportion of souring from her disap∣pointment;
of consequence her company was
not much coveted, and she found very few peo∣ple
disposed to treat her with those marks of con∣sideration
which she looked upon as her due.
This neglect detached her from the society of an
unmannerly world; she concentred the energy of
all her talents in the government of her own
house, which groaned accordingly under her ar∣bitrary
sway, and in the brandy-bottle found
ample consolation for all the affliction she had
undergone.</P>
<P>As for the commodore, he in a little time wea∣thered
his disgrace, after having sustained many
severe jokes from the lieutenant; and now his
chief aim being to be absent from his own house
as much as possible, he frequented the publick∣house
more than ever, more assiduously cultivated
the friendship of his brother-in-law Mr. Pickle,
and in the course of their intimacy conceived an
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
affection for his nephew Perry, which did not
end but with his life. Indeed it must be owned
that Trunnion was not naturally deficient in the
social passions of the soul, which, tho' they were
strangely warped, disguised and overborne by the
circumstances of his boisterous life and educa∣tion,
did not fail to manifest themselves occa∣sionally
thro' the whole course of his behaviour.</P>
<P>As all his hopes of propagating his own name
had perished, and his relations lay under the in∣terdiction
of his hate, it is no wonder that thro'
the familiarity and friendly intercourse subsisting
between him and Mr. Gamaliel, he contracted a
liking for the boy, who by this time entered the
third year of his age, and was indeed a very
handsome, healthy and promising child; and what
seemed to ingratiate him still more with his un∣cle,
was a certain oddity of disposition for which
he had been remarkable even from his cradle. It
is reported of him, that before the first year of
his infancy was elapsed, he used very often, im∣mediately
after being dressed, in the midst of the
caresses which were bestowed upon him by his
mother while she indulged herself in the contem∣plation
of her own happiness, all of a sudden to
alarm her with a fit of shrieks and cries, which
continued with great violence till he was stripped
to the skin with the utmost expedition by order
of his affrighted parent, who thought his tender
body was tortured by the misapplication of some
unlucky pin; and when he had given them all
this disturbance and unnecessary trouble, he would
lie sprawling and laughing in their faces, as if
he ridiculed the impertinence of their concern.
Nay it is affirmed, that one day, when an old
woman who attended in the nursery had by
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
stealth conveyed a bottle of cordial waters to
her mouth, he pulled his nurse by the sleeve,
and by a slight glance detecting the thest,
tipt her the wink with a particular slyness of
countenance, as if he had said with a sneer,
“Ay, ay, that is what you must all come to.”
But these instances of reflection in a babe nine
months old are so incredible, that I look upon
them as <HI>ex post facto</HI> observations, founded upon
imaginary recollection, when he was in a more
advanced age, and his peculiarities of temper be∣came
much more remarkable: of a piece with the
ingenious discoveries of those sagacious observers,
who can discern something evidently character∣istic
in the features of any noted personage whose
character they have previously heard explained;
yet, without pretending to specify at what period
of his childhood this singularity first appeared, I
can with great truth declare, that when he first
attracted the notice and affection of his uncle, it
was plainly perceivable.</P>
<P>One would imagine he had marked out the
commodore as a proper object of ridicule, for
almost all his little childish satire was levelled
against him. I will not deny that he might have
been influenced in this particular by the example
and instruction of Mr. Hatchway, who delighted
in superintending the first essays of his genius.
As the gout had taken up its residence in Mr.
Trunnion's great toe, from whence it never re∣moved,
no not for a day, little Perry took great
pleasure in treading by accident on this infirm
member; and when his uncle, incensed by the
pain used to damn him for a hell-begotten brat,
he would appease him in a twinkling by return∣ing
the curse with equal emphasis, and asking
about was the matter with old Hannibal Tough?
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
an appellation by which the lieutenant had taught
him to distinguish this grim commander.</P>
<P>Neither was this the only experiment he tried
upon the patience of the commodore, with whose
nose he used to take indecent freedoms even
while he was fondled on his knee; in one month
he put him to the expence of two guineas in
seal-skin, by picking his pocket of divers tobacco
pouches, all of which he in secret committed to
the flames. Nor did the caprice of his dispo∣sition
abstain from the favourite beverage of
Trunnion, who more than once swallowed a
whole draught in which his brother's snuff-box
had been emptied, before he perceived the dis∣agreeable
infusion: and one day, when the com∣modore
had chastised him by a gentle tap with his
cane, he fell flat on the floor as if he had been
deprived of all sense and motion, to the terror
and amazement of the striker; and after having
filled the whole house with confusion and dismay,
opened his eyes and laughed heartily at the suc∣cess
of his own imposition.</P>
<P>It would be an endless and perhaps no very
agreeable task, to enumerate all the unlucky
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranks he played upon his uncle and others, be∣fore
he attained the fourth year of his age; about
which time he was sent, with an attendant, to a
day-school in the neighbourhood, that (to use
his good mother's own expression) he might be
out of harm's way. Here, however, he made
little progress, except in mischief, which he prac∣tised
with impunity, because the school-mistress
would run no risk of disobliging a lad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of for∣tune,
by exercising unnecessary severities upon
her only child. Nevertheless Mrs. Pickle was
not so blindly partial as to be pleased with such
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
unseasonable indulgence. Perry was taken out
of the hands of this courteous teacher, and com∣mitted
to the instruction of a pedagogue, who
was ordered to administer such correction as the
boy should in his opinion deserve. This autho∣rity
he did not neglect to use; his pupil was re∣gularly
flogged twice a day, and after having been
subjected to this course of discipine for the space of
eighteen months, declared the most obstinate, dull
and untoward genius that ever had fallen under his
cultivation; instead of being reformed, he seemed
rather hardened and confirmed in his vicious in∣clinations,
and was dead to all sense of fear as
well as shame. His mother was extremely mor∣tified
at these symptoms of stupidity, which she
considered as an inheritance derived from the spirit
of his father, and consequently insurmountable
by all the efforts of human car. But the com∣modore
rejoiced over the over the ruggedness of his na∣ture
and was particularly pleased when upon in∣quiry
he found that Perry had beaten all the boys
in the school, a circumstance from which he
prognosticated every thing that was fair and for∣tunate
in his future fate: observing, that at his
age he himself was just such another. The boy,
who was now turned of six, having profited so
little under the birch of his unsparing governor,
Mrs. Pickle was counselled to send him to a board∣ing
-school not far from London, which was kept
by a certain person very eminent for his successful
method of education. This advice she the more
readily embraced, because at that time she found
herself pretty far gone with another child, that she
hoped would console her for the disappointment she
had met with in the unpromising talents of Perry,
or at any rate divide her concern, so as to enable
her to endure the absence of either.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is sent to a boarding-school, becomes re∣markable
for his genius and ambition.</HEAD>
<P>THE commodore understanding her deter∣mination,
to which her husband did not
venture to make the least objection, interested
himself so much in behalf of his favourite, as to
fit him out at his own charge, and accompany
him in person to the place of his destination;
where he defrayed the expence of his entrance,
and left him to the particular care and inspection
of the usher, who having been recommended to
him as a person of parts and integrity, received
<HI>per</HI> advance a handsome consideration for the task
he undertook.</P>
<P>Nothing could be better judged than this piece
of liberality; the assistant was actually a man of
learning, probity, and good sense; and though
obliged by the scandalous administration of for∣tune
to act in the character of an inferior teacher,
had by his sole capacity and application, brought
the school to that degree of reputation which it
never could have obtained from the talents of his
superior. He had established an oeconomy, which
though regular, was not at all severe, by enact∣ing
a body of laws suited to the age and compre∣hension
of every individual; and each transgressor
was fairly tried by his peers, and punished accord∣ing
to the verdict of the jury. No boy was
scourged for want of apprehension, but a spirit of
emulation was raised by well-timed praise and art∣ful
comparison, and maintained by a distribution
of small prizes, which were adjudged to those who
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
signalized themselves either by their industry, so∣briety
or genius. This tutor, whose name was
Jennings, began with Perry, according to his
constant maxim, by examining the soil; that is,
studying his temper, in order to consult the biass
of his disposition, which was strangely perverted
by the absurd discipline he had undergone. He
found him in a state of sullen insensibility, which
the child had gradually contracted in a long course
of stupifying correction; and at first he was not
in the least actuated by that commendation which
animated the rest of his school-fellows; nor was
it in the power of reproach to excite his ambition,
which had been buried, as it were, in the grave
of disgrace: the usher therefore had recourse to
contemptuous neglect, with which he affected to
treat this stubborn spirit; foreseeing that if he re∣tained
any seeds of sentiment, this weather would
infallibly raise them into vegetation: his judgement
was justified by the event; the boy in a little time
began to make observations; he perceived the
marks of distinction with which virtue was re∣warded,
grew ashamed of the despicable figure he
himself made amongst his companions, who far
from courting, rather shunned his conversation;
and actually pined at his own want of importance.</P>
<P>Mr. Jennings saw and rejoiced at his mortifi∣cation,
which he suffered to proceed as far as pos∣sible,
without endangering his health. The child
lost all relish for diversion, loathed his food, grew
pensive, solitary, and was frequently found weep∣ing
by himself. These symptoms plainly evinced
the recovery of his feelings, to which his gover∣nor
thought it now high time to make applica∣tion;
and therefore by little and little altered his
behaviour from the indifference he had put on, to
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
the appearance of more regard and attention.
This produced a favourable change in the boy,
whose eyes sparkled with satisfaction one day,
when his master expressed himself with a shew of
surprize in these words, “So, Perry! I find you
don't want genius, when you think proper to use
it.” Such encomiums kindled the spirit of emu∣lation
in his little breast; he exerted himself with
surprising alacrity, by which he soon acquitted
himself of the imputation of dullness, and obtained
sundry honorary silver pennies, as acknowledge∣ments
of his application: his schoolfellows now
sollicited his friendship as eagerly as they had
avoided it before; and in less than a twelvemonth
after his arrival, this supposed dunce was remark∣able
for the brightness of his parts; having in
that short period learnt to read English perfectly
well, made great progress in writing, enabled
himself to speak the French language without he∣sitation,
and acquired some knowledge in the ru∣diments
of the Latin tongue. The usher did not
fail to transmit an account of his proficiency to
the commodore, who received it with transport,
and forthwith communicated the happy tidings to
the parents.</P>
<P>Mr. Gamaliel Pickle, who was never subject
to violent emotions, heard them with a sort of
phlegmatic satisfaction that scarce manifested itself
either in his countenance of expressions; nor did
the child's mother break forth into that rapture
and admiration which might have been expected,
when she understood how much the talents of her
first-born had exceeded the hope of her warmest
magination. Not but that she professed herself
well pleased with Perry's reputation; though she
observed that in these commendations the truth was
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
always exaggerated by school-masters, for their own
interest; and pretended to wonder that the usher
had not mingled more probability with his praise.
Trunnion was offended at her indifference and
want of faith, and believing that she refined too
much in her discernment, swore that Jennings
had declared the truth, and nothing but the
truth; for he himself had prophecied from the
beginning, that the boy would turn out a credit
to his family. But by this time Mrs. Pickle was
blessed with a daughter, whom she had brought
into the world about six months before the intel∣ligence
arrived; so that her care and affection be∣ing
otherwise engrossed, the praise of Perry was
the less greedily devoured. The abatement of her
fondness was an advantage to his education, which
would have been retarded, and perhaps ruined by
pernicious indulgence and preposterous interposi∣tion,
had her love considered him as an only
child; whereas her concern being now diverted
to another object that shared, at least, one half
of her affection, he was left to the management
of his preceptor, who tutored him according to
his own plan, without any lett or interruption.
Indeed all his sagacity and circumspection were
but barely sufficient to keep the young gentleman
in order; for now that he had won the palm of
victory from his rivals in point of scholarship, his
ambition dilated, and he was seized with the de∣sire
of subjecting the whole school by the valour
of his arm. Before he could bring this project to
bear, innumerable battles were fought with vari∣ous
success; every day a bloody nose and com∣plaint
were presented against him, and his own
visage commonly bore some livid marks of obsti∣nate
contention. At length, however, he ac∣complished
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
his aim; his adversaries were subdued,
his prowess acknowledged, and he obtained the
laurel in war as well as wit. Thus triumphant,
he was intoxicated with success. His pride rose in
proportion to his power, and in spite of all the
endeavours of Jennings, who practised every me∣thod
he could invent for curbing his licentious
conduct, without depressing his spirit, he con∣tracted
a large proportion of insolence, which a
series of misfortunes that happened to him in the
sequel could scarce effectually tame. Neverthe∣less
there was a fund of good nature and genero∣sity
in his composition; and though he established
a tyranny among his comrades, the tranquility
of his reign was maintained by the love rather
than by the fear of his subjects.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this enjoyment of empire,
he never once violated that respectful awe with
which the usher had found means to inspire him;
but he by no means preserved the same regard for
the principal master, an old illiterate German
quack, who had formerly practised corn-cutting
among the quality, and sold cosmetic washes to
the ladies, together with teeth-powders, hair∣dying
liquors, prolifick elixirs, and tinctures to
sweeten the breath. These nostrums, recommended
by the art of cringing, in which he was consum∣mate,
ingratiated him so much with people of
fashion, that he was enabled to set up-school with
five and twenty boys of the best families, whom
he boarded on his own terms, and undertook to
instruct in the French and Latin languages, so as
to qualify them for the colleges of Westminster
or Eaton. While this plan was in its infancy,
he was so fortunate as to meet with Jennings,
who for the paultry consideration of thirty pounds
<PB N="90" REF="98"/>
a year, which his necessities compelled him to
accept, took the whole trouble of educating the
children upon himself, contrived an excellent sy∣stem
for that purpose, and by his assiduity and
knowledge executed all the particulars to the en∣tire
satisfaction of those concerned, who by the
bye, never inquired into his qualifications, but
suffered the other to enjoy the fruits of his labour
and ingenuity.</P>
<P>Over and above a large stock of avarice, ig∣norance
and vanity, this superior had certain ridi∣culous
peculiarities in his person, such as a hunch
upon his back, and distorted limbs, that seemed
to attract the satirical notice of Peregrine, who,
young as he was, took offence at his want of re∣verence
for his usher, over whom he sometimes
chose opportunities of displaying his authority,
that the boys might not misplace their venera∣tion.
Mr. Keypstick, therefore, such as I have
described him, incurred the contempt and dis∣pleasure
of this enterprising pupil, who now being
in the tenth year of his age, had capacity enough
to give him abundance of vexation.</P>

usher was engaged in some other employment.</P>
<P>On these occasions he practised a thousand pi∣tiful
shifts to conceal his own nakedness; some∣times
reprehending the boy for disturbing him in
his meditations, sometimes pleading the weakness
of his eyes, that hindered him from considering
the passage; and sometimes remitting him to the
dictionary, as a punishment for his inattention
when it was construed by Mr. Jennings. Not∣withstanding
these evasions, he was persecuted by
his tormentor with such perseverance, that he
could find no other resource than that of pretend∣ing
to be in a violent hurry, in consequence of
which he always quitted the place; so that when∣ever
Perry and his companions were incommoded
by his presence, they had recourse to this expe∣dient,
which never failed to expel him in a trice.</P>
<P>Not contented with having thus rendered him
contemptible in the eyes of his disciples, this in∣defa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igable
wag exercised his invention in various
contrivances, to plague, disturb and expose him.</P>
<P>Conscious of his own defect in point of stature
and proportion, the little pedant used all the ad∣ditions
of art and address to improve his person,
and raise himself as near as possible to the standard
dimensions of nature; with this view he wore
shoes with heels three inches high, strutted like
a peacock in walking, and erected his head with
such muscular exertion, as rendered it impossible
for him to extend his vision downwards blow the
preternatural prominence of his breast. Peregrine,
therefore, taking advantage of this foppery, used
to strew his way with bean-shells, on which
whenever he chanced to tread, his heels slipped
<PB N="92" REF="100"/>
from under him, his hunch pitched upon the
ground, and the furniture of his head fell off in
the shock; so that he lay in a very ludicrous atti∣tude
for the entertainment of the spectators. He
moreover seized opportunities of studding his
breeches with large pins, which when he sat down
with a sudden jirk, penetrated the skin of his po∣steriors,
and compelled him to start up again with
infinite expedition, and roar hideously with the
pain. Nay, perceiving that he was extremely pe∣nurious
in his house-keeping, he spoilt many a
pot of excellent soup maigre, by slily conveying
into it handfuls of salt or soot, and even drove
needles into the heads of sundry fowls, that from
the suddenness of their death he might conclude
some infection was communicated to his poultry,
and dispose of them accordingly for the half of their
value. But no instance of young Pickle's mischievous
talents affected him with such immediate perplexity
and confusion as this that I am going to recount.</P>
<P>Being apprized by one of his friends that a lady
of fashion intended to visit his school on a certain
day, without giving any previous notice of her
coming, that she might be an eye-witness of the
accommodation in his house before she would
commit her son to his care, he ordered his
boarders and apartments to be dished out for the
occasion, spared no pains in adorning his own
person, and in particular employed a whole hour
in adjusting a voluminous tye, in which he pro∣posed
to make his appearance. Thus prepared,
he waited with great confidence and tranquillity,
and no sooner saw the coach appear at a distance,
than he went to his closet in order to put on the
periwig, which he had deposited in a box, that no
accident might ruffle or discompose it before it
was presented to her ladyship; but neither the
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
box nor its contents were to be found. At first
he thought it might be misplaced by some of the
servants, to whom he called with great eagerness
and vociferation, while he himself ran from room
to room in quest of what he wanted: the domes∣ticks
could give him no intelligence of his tye;
he heard the gates opened to admit the equipage,
his impatience increased, he swore in high Dutch,
the noise of the wheels on his pavement saluted
his ears, his vexation redoubled, and tossing his
night-cap on the floor, he waddled down stairs
to the hall for his ordinary periwig, which he now
found himself compelled to wear. How shall I
describe his disstraction when he understood that
too was missing! he became quite delirious,
foamed at the mouth, danced to and fro in the
passage like one berest of his senses, blasphemed
alternately in English and French, and must have
been found by the lady in that frantic condition,
had not his servants conveyed him to his own
chamber by force.</P>
<P>The noble visitant was received by Jennings,
who told her that Mr. Keypstick was confined
to his bed, and explained the whole oeconomy of
the school so much to her satisfaction, that she
resolved to honour them with the charge of her
own offspring. Keypstick fell sick in good earnest,
and his intellects seemed to have received a rude
shock from the violence of the passion into which
he had been precipitated by the roguery of Pere∣grine,
who had concealed both periwigs in the
cellar, and now having enjoyed his trick, car∣ried
them back unperceived to the places from
which they had been removed.</P>
<P>A whole week elapsed before the master reco∣vered
so much temper as to appear decently in pub∣lic;
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
and even then his countenance, was stormy,
and his resentment against the authors of his dis∣grace
so intense, that he promised a reward of
five guineas to any boy that would discover the
principal actor, or any of the accomplices con∣cerned
in this audacious intrigue; declaring that
no consideration should screen the offenders form
condign punishment, could they once be con∣victed
of the trick.</P>
<P>Pickle had not conducted this <HI>Jeu d'esprit</HI>
without participation, and some there were privy
to the affair whose fidelity was not incorruptible;
but their secrecy was secured by the terror of Pe∣regrine,
whose authority and influence was such
as to baffle the master in all his endeavours to un∣ravel
the conspiracy.</P>
<P>This extraordinary reserve, and the recollec∣tion
of several other mortifying jokes he had
undergone, inspired him with ungenerous suspi∣cions
of Mr. Jennings, who he could not help
thinking had been at the bottom of them all, and
spirited up principles of rebellion in the school,
with a view of making himself independent. Pos∣sessed
with this chimera, which was void of all foun∣dation,
the German descended so low as to tam∣per
in private with the boys, from whom he hoped
to draw some very important discovery; but he
was disappointed in his expectation; and this
mean practice reaching the ears of his usher, he
vol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntarily resigned his employment, and finding
interest to obtain holy orders in a little time after,
left the kingdom, hoping to find a settlement in
some of our American plantations.</P>
<P>The departure of Mr. Jennings produced a
great revolution in the affairs of Keypstick, which
declined from that moment, because he had neither
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
authority to enforce obedience, nor prudence to
maintain order among his scholars; so that the
school degenerated into anarchy and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion,
and he himself dwindled in the opinion of his
imployers, who looked upon him as superannu∣ated.
and withdrew their children from his tui∣tion.</P>
<P>Peregrine seeing this dissolution of their society,
and finding himself every day deprived of some
companion, began to repine at his situation, and
resolved, if possible, to procure his release from
the jurisdiction of a person whom he both detested
and despised. With this view he went to work,
and composed the following billet, addressed to
the commodore, which was the first specimen of
his composition in the epistolary way.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured and loving uncle,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HOping you are in good health, this serves
to inform you, that Mr. Jennings is
gone, and Mr. Keypstick will never meet with
his fellow. The school is already almost broke
up, and the rest daily going away; and I beg of
you of all love to have me fetched away also, for
I cannot bear to be any longer under one who is
a perfect ignoramus, who scarce knows the decli∣nation
of <HI>musa,</HI> and is more fit to be a scare-crow
than a schoolmaster; hoping you will send for
me soon, with my love to my aunt and my duty

<P><PB N="96" REF="104"/>
Trunnion was overjoyed at the receit of this
letter, which he looked upon as one of the greatest
efforts of human genius, and as such communi∣cated
the contents to his lady, whom he had dis∣turbed
for the purpose in the middle of her devo∣tion,
by sending a message to her closet, whither
it was her custom very frequently to retire. She
was out of humour at being interrupted, and
therefore did not peruse this specimen of her ne∣phew's
understanding with all the relish that the
commodore himself had enjoyed; on the con∣trary,
after sundry paralytical endeavours to speak,
(for her tongue sometimes refused its office) she
observed that the boy was a pert jackanapes, and
deserved to be severely chastised for treating his
betters with such disrespect. Her husband under∣took
his godson's defence, representing with great
warmth that he knew Keypstick to be a good for
nothing pimping old rascal, and that Perry shewed
a great deal of spirit and good sense in desiring to
be taken from under his command; he therefore
declared that the boy should not live a week
longer with such a shambling son of a bitch, and
sanctioned his declaration with abundance of
oaths.</P>
<P>Mrs. Trunnion composing her countenance
into a look of religious demureness, rebuked him
for his profane way of talking, and asked in a
magisterial tone if he intended never to lay aside
that brutal behaviour? Irritated at this reproach,
he answered in terms of indignation, that he knew
how to behave himself as well as e'er a woman
that wore a head, bad her mind her own affairs,
and with another repetition of oaths gave her to
understand that he would be master in his own
house.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="105"/>
This insinuation operated upon her spirits like
friction upon a glass globe, her face gleamed with
resentment, and every pore seemed to emit par∣ticles
of flame. She replied with incredible fluency
of the bitterest expressions. He retorted equal
rage in broken hints and incoherent imprecations.
She rejoined with redoubled fury, and in conclu∣sion
he was fain to betake himself to flight, eja∣culating
curses against her; and muttering some∣thing
concerning the brandy-bottle, which, how∣ever,
he took care should never reach her ears.</P>
<P>From his own house he went directly to visit Mrs.
Pickle, to whom he imparted Peregrine's epistle
with many encomiums upon the boy's promising
parts; and finding his commendations but coldly
received, desired she would permit him to take
his godson under his own care.</P>
<P>This lady, whose family was now increased by
another son that seemed to engross her care for
the present, had not seen Perry during a course
of four years, and with regard to him, was per∣fectly
weaned of that infirmity known by the
name of maternal fondness; she therefore con∣sented
to the commodore's request with great con∣descension,
and a polite compliment to him on
the concern he had all along manifested for the
welfare of the child.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The commodore takes Peregrine under his own care▪
The boy arrives at the garrison;—is strangely
received by his own mother;—enters into a confe∣deracy
with Hatchway and Pipes, and executes
a couple of waggish enterprizes upon his aunt.</HEAD>
<P>TRunnion having obtained this permission
that very afternoon, dispatched the lieute∣nant
in a post chaise to Keypstick's house, from
whence in two days he returned with our young
hero; who being now in the eleventh year of his
age, had outgrown the expectation of all his fa∣mily,
and was remarkable for the beauty and ele∣gance
of his person. His godfather was trans∣ported
at his arrival, as if he had been actually
the issue of his own loins. He shook him heartily
by the hand, turned him round and round, sur∣veyed
him from top to bottom, bad Hatchway
take notice how handsomely he was built;
squeezed his hand again, saying, “Damn ye, you
dog, I suppose you don't value such an old crazy
son of a bitch as me, a rope's end. You have for∣got
how I wont to dandle you on my knee, when
you was a little urchin no higher than the David,
and played a thousand tricks upon me, burning
my bacco-pouches and poisoning my rumbo: O!
damn ye, you can grin fast enough I see; I war∣rant
you have learnt more things than writing
and the Latin lingo.” Even Tom Pipes expressed
uncommon satisfaction on this joyful occasion;
and coming up to Perry, thrust forth his fore∣paw,
and accosted him with the salutation of
“What chear, my young master? I am glad see
<PB N="99" REF="107"/>
thee with all my heart.” These compliments be∣ing
passed, his uncle halted to the door of his
wife's chamber, at which he stood hollowing,
“Here's your kinsman Perry, belike you won't
come and bid him welcome.” “Lord! Mr.
Trunnion, said she, why will you continually har∣rass
me in this manner with your impertinent in∣trusion?”
“I harrow you, replied the commodore,
'sblood! I believe your upper works are damaged.
I only came to inform you that here was your
cousin, whom you have not seen these four long
years; and I'll be damned if there is such another
of his age within the king's dominions, d'ye see,
either for make or mettle; he's a credit to the
name, d'ye see, but damn my eyes I'll say no
more of the matter; if you come you may, if
you won't you may let it alone.” “Well, I
won't come then (answered his yoke-fellow) for
I am at present more agreeably employed.”
“Oho! you are? I believe so too;” cried the
commodore, making wry faces and mimicking
the action of dram-drinking. Then addressing
himself to Hatchway, “Prithee Jack, said he,
go and try thy skill on that stubborn hulk; if any
body can bring her about I know you wool.”
The lieutenant accordingly taking his station at
the door, conveyed his perswasion in these words.
“What won't you turn out and hail little Perry?
It will do your heart good to see such a handsome
young dog; I'm sure he is the very moral of you,
and as like as if he had been spit out of your
own mouth, as the saying is; do shew a little
respect for your kinsman, can't you.” To this
rem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstrance she replied in a mild tone of voice,
“Dear Mr. Hatchway, you are always teazing
one in such a manner; sure I am, no body can
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>
tax me with unkindness, or want of natural af∣fection;”
so saying, she opened the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, and
advancing to the hall where her nephew stood, re∣ceived
him very graciously, and observed that he
was the very image of her papa.</P>
<P>In the afternoon he was conducted by the com∣modore
to the house of his parents; and strange
to tell, no sooner was he presented to his mother
than her countenance changed, she eyed him with
tokens of affliction and surprize, and bursting
into tears, exclaimed her child was dead, and this
was no other than an impostor whom they had
brought to desraud her sorrow. Trunnion was
confounded at this unaccountable passion, which
had no other foundation than caprice and whim;
and Gamaliel himself so disconcerted and unsettled
in his own belief, which began to waver, that he
knew not how to behave towards the boy, whom
his godfather immediately carried back to the
garrison, swearing all the way that Perry should
never cross their threshold again with his good∣will.
Nay, so much was he incensed at this un∣natural
and absurd renunciation, that he refused
to carry on any further correspondence with
Pickle, until he was appeased by his sollici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations
and submission, and Peregrine owned as his son
and heir. But this acknowledgment was made
without the privity of his wife, whose vicious
aversion he was obliged, in appearance, to adopt.
Thus exiled from his father's house, the young
gentleman was left entirely to the disposal of the
commodore, whose affection for him daily in∣creased,
insomuch, that he could scarce prevail
upon himself to part with him, when his educa∣tion
absolutely required that he should be other∣wise
disposed of.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="109"/>
In all probability, this extraordinary attach∣ment
was, if not produced, at least rivetted by
that peculiar turn in Peregrine's imagination,
which we have already observed; and which,
during his residence in the castle, appeared in
sundry stratagems he practised upon his uncle and
aunt, under the auspices of Mr. Hatchway, who
assisted him in the contrivance and execution of
all his schemes. Nor was Pipes exempted from
a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are in their undertakings for, being a trusty
fellow, not without dexterity in some cases, and
altogether resigned to their will, they found him
a serviceable instrument for their purpose, and
used him accordingly.</P>
<P>The first sample of their art was exhibited upon
Mrs. Trunnion, from whose chamber Peregrine
having secreted a cetain utensil, divers holes were
drilled through the bottom of it by their operator;
and then it was replaced in a curious case that
stood by the bed-side, in which it was reserved
for midnight-occasions. The good lady had that
evening made several extraordinary visits to her
closet, and that sort of exercise never failed of
having a diuretic effect uponher constitution; so
that she and her husband were scarce warm
in bed, when she found it convenient to reach
out her hand, and introduce this receptacle under
the cloaths. It was then that Peregrine's roguery
took effect. The commodore, who had just
composed himself to rest, was instantly alarmed
with a strange sensation in his right shoulder, on
which something warm seemed to descend in va∣rious
streams: he no sooner comprehended the
nature of this shower, which in a twinkling be∣dewed
him from head to foot, than he exclaimed,
“Blood and oons! I'm afloat?” and starting
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
up, asked with great bitterness if she had pissed
through a watering can. Equally surprized and of∣fended
at the indecent question, she began to re∣gale
him with a lecture on the subject of that re∣spect
in which she thought him so deficient; but
perceiving the source of his displeasure, was silenc∣ed
in the middle of the first sentence; and after
a short pause of astonishment, screamed with vex∣ation.</P>
<P>As there was a necessity for shifting the bed∣linnen,
she got up with great reluctance, rung
her bell, and when her mad entered, presented
this new fashioned cullender, and threatened with
many choleric expressions to split it into a thou∣sand
pieces on her skull. Thunderstruck at the
phaenomenon, it was some time beore the atten∣dant
could open her lips in her own vindication;
at length, however, she protested she was inno∣cent
as the babe unborn, and that the pot was
found and intire when she rinsed it in the after∣noon.</P>
<P>Her suspicion was of consequence transferred
upon Perry, against whom she uttered many me∣nacing
invectives; though she was afterwards
ashamed of disclosing her resentment, and in the
mean time was fain to take up her night's
lodging in another apartment; while Trunnion,
after a string of unmeaning oaths, which were
extorted from him by his present uncomfortable
situation, could not help laughing at the adven∣ture;
and Peregrine with his confederates, ap∣plauded
themselves in secret for having reduced
them to such ridiculous distress.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the impunity with which they
performed this feat, our associates atchieved ano∣ther,
that had like to have been attended with
<PB N="103" REF="111"/>
very serious consequences. Mrs. Trunnion hav∣ing
one day received a sudden call which she
could not help obeying, her nephew, who was
always on the scout, took that opportunity of
gliding unseen into her closet, and finding her
case open, infused into one of the bottles a good
quantity of powdered jallap, which had been pur∣chased
by the lieutenant for that purpose. He had
desired the apothecary from whom he bought it,
to give him as much as would impregnate two
quarts of brandy, which, he guessed, each bottle
might contain; and never dreamed that the pa∣tient,
though left to her own discretion, was in
any danger of taking an over-dose; he therefore
directed Perry to convey the whole proportion
into one of the full bottles that stood at some di∣stance
from that which he would perceive wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
present use, that the spirits might have time to
extract the virtues of the root before it should
come to their turn. Every thing was done ac∣cording
to his prescription, and a very small hole
being bored in the wainscot, through which they
could reconnoitre her from another room; they
observed her motions by turns, with a view of
seeing whether or not she would be alarmed by
the extraordinary taste of the tincture they had
made.</P>
<P>When they had watched in this manner for
three or four days, Pipes being upon duty, per∣ceived
her take the first cup of the composition,
which she had no sooner swallowed, than she be∣gan
to shut her eyes, smack her lips, spit and
express all the marks of loathing and disgust: ne∣vertheless
she seemed to doubt her own sense,
rather than the flavour of the Coniac, the neat∣ness
of which she had already experienced, and
<PB N="104" REF="112"/>
therefore repeated the cordial, as if in defiance to
her own distaste; taking care, however, to arm
her palate with a large lump of sugar, through
which it was strained in its passage.</P>
<P>Hatchway was startled when he understood she
had taken such a dangerous draught of the medi∣cine,
especially as she had immediately after step∣ped
into the coach to go to church, where he
feared she might catch cold, or be otherwise af∣fected,
to the jeopardy of her person and the pre∣judice
of her reputation. Nor was his fear alto∣gether
disappointed. The service was not half
performed, when Mrs. Trunnion was suddenly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken ill; her face underwent violent flushings
and vicissitudes of complexion; a cold clammy
sweat bedewed her forehead, and her bowels were
afflicted with such agonies, as compelled her to
retire in the face of the congregation. She was
brougt home in torture, which was a little as∣suaged
when the dose began to operate; but such
was the excess of evacuation she sustained, that
her spirits were quite exhausted, and she suffered
a succession of fainting fits that reduced her to
the brink of the grave, in spite of all the reme∣dies
that were administered by a physician who
was called in the beginning of her disorder, and
who, after having examined the symptoms, de∣clared
that the patient had been poisoned with
arsenic, and prescribed oily draughts and lubri∣cating
injections to defend the coats of the sto∣mach
and intestines from the vellicating particles
of that pernicious mineral; at the same time hint∣ing,
with a look of infinite sagacity, that it was
not difficult to divine the whole mystery; and
affecting to deplore the poor lady, as if she was
exposed to more attempts of the same nature;
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
thereby glancing obliquely at the innocent com∣modore,
whom the officious son of Aesculapius
suspected as the author of this expedient, to rid
his hands of a yoke-fellow, for whom he was
well known to have no great devotion. This
impertinent and malicious insinuation made some
impression upon the by-standers, and fur∣nished
ample field for slander, to asperse the mo∣rals
of Trunnion, who was represented through
the whole district as a monster of barbarity.
Nay, the sufferer herself, though she behaved
with great decency and prudence, could not help
entertaining some small diffidence of her husband:
not that she imagined he had any design upon her
life, but that he had been at pains to adulterate
the brandy, with the view of detaching her from
that favourite liquor.</P>
<P>On this supposition she resolved to act with
more caution for the future, without setting on
foot any inquiry about the affair; while the
commodore imputing her indisposition to some
natural cause, after the danger was past, never
bestowed a thought upon the subject; so that the
perpetrators were quit for their fear, which, how∣ever,
had punished them so effectually, that they
never would hazard any more jokes of the same
nature.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The triumvirate turn the stream of their wit upon
the commodore, who by their means is embroiled
with an attorney, and terrified with an appari∣tion.</HEAD>
<P>THE shafts of their wit were now directed
against the commander himself, whom
they teized and terrified almost out of his senses.
One day while he was at dinner, Pipes came and
told him that there was a person below that
wanted to speak with him immediately about an
affair of the greatest importance, that would admit
of no delay; upon which he ordered the stranger
to be told that he was engaged, and that he must
send up his name and business. To this demand
he received for answer a message, importing that
the person's name was unknown to him, and his
business of such a nature, that it could not be dis∣closed
to any one but the commodore himself,
whom he earnestly desired to see without loss of
time.</P>
<P>Trunnion, surprised at this importunity, got
up with great reluctance in the middle of his
meal, and descending to a parlour where the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, was asked in a surly tone what he wanted
with him in such a damned hurry, that he could
not wait till he had made an end of his mess.
The other, not at all disconcerted at this rough
address, advanced close up to him on his tiptoes,
and with a look of confidence and conceit, laying
his mouth to one side of the commodore's head,
whispered so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly in his ear, “Sir, I am the attor∣ney
whom you wanted to converse with in pri∣vate.”
<PB N="107" REF="115"/>
“The attorney!” cried Trunnion, stare∣ing
and half choaked with choler. “Yes, Sir,
at your service, replied this retainer to the law,
and if you please, the sooner we dispatch the affair
the better; for 'tis an old observation, that delay
breeds danger.” “Truly, brother, said the com∣modore,
who could no longer contain himself,
I do confess that I am very much of your way of
thinking, d'ye see; and therefore you shall be
dispatched in a trice;” so saying, he lifted up his
walking staff, which was something between a
crutch and a cudgel, and discharged it with such
energy on the seat of the attorney's understand∣ing,
that if there had been any thing but solid
bone, the contents of his skull must have been
evacuated.</P>
<P>Fortified as he was by nature against all such
assaults, he could not withstand the momentum
of the blow, which in an instant laid him flat on
the floor, deprived of all sense and motion; and
Trunnion hopped up stairs to dinner, applauding
himself in ejaculations all the way for the ven∣geance
he had taken on such an impudent petti∣fogging
miscreant.</P>
<P>The attorney no sooner awaked from this
tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, into which he had been so unexpectedly
lulled, than he cast his eyes around in quest of
evidence, by which he might be enabled the more
easily to prove the injury he had sustained; but
not a soul appearing, he made shift to get upon
his legs again, and with the blood trickling over
his nose, followed one of the servants into the
dining-room, resolved to come to an explanation
with the assailant, and either extort money from
him by way of satisfaction, or provoke him to a
second application before witnesses. With this
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
view he entered the room in a peal of clamour,
to the amazement of all present, and the terror of
Mrs. Trunnion, who shrieked at the appearance
of such a spectacle; and addressing himself to the
commodore, “I'll tell you what, Sir, said he,
if there be law in England, I'll make you smart
for this here assault; you think you have screened
yourself from a prosecution, by sending all your
servants out of the way, but that circumstance
will appear upon trial to be a plain proof of the
malice propense with which the fact was com∣mitted;
especially when corroborated by the evi∣dence
of this here letter, under your own hand,
whereby I am desired to come to your own house
to transact an affair of consequence;” so saying,
he produced the writing, and read the contents in
these words.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The one-eyed commander who had been satis∣fied
with the chastisement he had already be∣stowed
upon the plaintiff, hearing him read this
audacious piece of forgery, which he considered
as the effect of his won villany, started up from
table, and seizing a huge turkey that lay in a dish
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
before him, would have applied it sauce and all by
way of poultice to his wound, had he not been
restrained by Hatchway, who laid fast hold on
both his arms, and fixed him to his chair again,
advising the attorney to sheer off with what he
had got. Far from following this salutary counsel,
he redoubled his threats, and set Trunnion at de∣fiance,
telling him he was not a man of true
courage, although he had commanded a ship of
war, or else he would not have attacked any
person in such a cowardly and clandestine man∣ner.
This provocation would have answered his
purpose effectually, had not his adversary's in∣dignation
been repressed by the suggestions of the
lieutenant who desired his friend in a whisper to
be easy, for he would take care to have the attor∣ney
tossed in a blanket for his presumption. This
proposal, which he received with great approba∣tion,
pacified him in a moment; he wiped the
sweat from his forehead, and his features relaxed
into a grim smile.</P>
<P>Hatchway disappeared, and Ravine proceeded
with great fluency of abuse, until he was interrupt∣ed
by the arrival of Pipes, who, without any expos∣tulation,
led him out by the hand, and conducted
him to the yard, where he was put into a carpet,
and in a twinkling sent into the air by the strength
and dexterity of five stout operators, whom the
lieutenant had selected from the number of do∣mesticks
for that singular spell of duty.</P>
<P>In vain did the astonished vaulter beg for the
love of God and passion of Christ, that they would
take pity upon him, and put an end to his in∣voluntary
gambols; they were deaf to his prayers
and protestations, even when he swore in the
most solemn manner, that if they would cease tor∣menting
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
him, he would forget and forgive what
was passed, and depart in peace to his own habi∣tation;
and continued the game till they were
fatigued with the exercise.</P>
<P>Ravine being dismissed in a most melancholy
plight, brought an action of assault and battery
against the commodore, and subpoena'd all the
servants as evidences in the cause; but as none of
them had seen what happened, he did not find his
account in the prosecution, though he himself
examined all the witnesses, and among other
questions, asked whether they had not seen him
come in like another man? and whether they had
ever seen any other man in such a condition as
that in which he had crawled off? But this last
interrogation they were not obliged to answer,
because it had reference to the second discipline he
had undergone, in which they, and they only
were concerned; and no person is bound to give
testimoney against himself.</P>
<P>In short, the attorney was nonsuited, to the
satisfaction of all who knew him, and found him∣self
under the necessity of proving that he had re∣ceived
in course of post, the letter which was de∣clared
in court a scandalous forgery, in order to
prevent an indictment with which he was threat∣ened
by the commodore, who little dreamt that
the whole affair had been planned and executed
by Peregrine and his associates.</P>
<P>The next enterprize in which this triumvirate
engaged, was a scheme to frighten Trunnion
with an apparition, which they prepared and ex∣hibited
in this manner. To the hide of a large
ox Pipes fitted a leathern vizor of a most terrible
appearance, stretched on the jaws of a shark
which he had brought from sea, and accommo∣dated
<PB N="111" REF="119"/>
with a couple of broad glasses instead of eyes.
On the inside of these he placed two rush lights,
and with a composition of sulphur and salt-petre,
made a pretty large fuse, which he fixed between
two rows of the teeth. This equipage being finished,
he, one dark night chosen for the purpose, put it
on, and following the commodore into a long
passage in which he was preceded by Perry with
a light in his hand, kindled his fire-work with a
match, and began to bellow like a bull. The boy,
as it was concerted, looking behind him, screamed
aloud, and dropped the light, which was extin∣guished
in the fall: when Trunnion alarmed at
his nephew's consternation, exclaimed, “Zounds!
what's the matter?” And turning about to see
the cause of his dismay, beheld a hideous phan∣tom
vomiting blue flame, which aggravated the
horrors of its aspect. He was instantly seized with
an agony of fear, which divested him of his rea∣son;
nevertheless, he, as it were mechanically,
raised his trusty supporter in his own defence, and
the apparition advancing towards him, aimed it
at this dreadful annoyance with such a convulsive
exertion of strength, that had not the blow
chanced to light upon one of the horns, Mr. Pipes
would have had no cause to value himself upon
his invention. Misapp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied as it was, he did not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail to stagger at the shock, and dreading another
such salutation, closed with the commodore, and
having tripped up his heels, retreated with great
expedition.</P>
<P>It was then that Peregrine, pretending to re∣collect
himself a little, run with all the marks
of disturbance and affright, and called up the
servants to the assistance of their master, whom
they found in a cold sweat-upon the floor, his
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>
features betokening horror and confusion. Hatch∣way
raised him up, and having comforted him
with a cup of Nantz, began to inquire into the
cause of his disorder: but he could not extract
one word of answer from his friend, who, after
a considerable pause, during which he seemed to
be wrapped up in profound contemplation, pro∣nounced
aloud, “By the Lord! Jack, you
may say what you wool; but I'll be damned if
it was not Davy Jones himself: I know him by
his saucer-eyes, his three rows of teeth, his horns
and tail, and the blue smoak that came out of
his nostrils. What does the black-guard, hell's
baby want with me? I'm sure I never committed
murder, nor wronged any man whatsomever,
since I first went to sea.” This same Davy
Jones, according to the mythology of sailors, is
the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of
the deep, and is often seen in various shapes,
perching among the rigging on the eve of hur∣ricanes,
shipwrecks, and other disasters, to which
a sea-faring life is exposed; <HI>warning the devoted
wretch of death and woe.</HI> No wonder then that
Trunnion was disturbed by a supposed visit of
this daemon, which, in his opinion, foreboded
some dreadful calamity.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is also by their device engaged in an adventure
with the excisemon, who does not find his account
in his own drollery.</HEAD>
<P>HOwsoever preposterous and unaccountable
that passion may be, which prompts per∣sons,
otherwise generous and sympathising, to
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
afflict and perplex their fellow-creatures, certain
it is our confederates entertained such a large
proportion of it, that not satisfied with the
pranks they had already played, they still perse∣cuted
the commodore without ceasing. In the
course of his own history, the particulars of
which he delighted to recount, he had often re∣hearsed
an adventure of deer-stealing, in which
(during the unthinking impetuosity of his youth)
he had been unfortunately concerned. Far from
succeeding in that atchievement, he and his asso∣ciates
had (it seems) been made prisoners, after an
obstinate engagement with the keepers, and car∣ried
before a neighbouring justice of the peace,
who used Trunnion with great indignity, and
with his companions committed him to jail.</P>
<P>His own relations, and in particular an uncle
on whom he chiefly depended, treated him during
his confinement with great rigour and inhuma∣nity,
and absolutely refused to interpose his in∣fluence
in his behalf, unless he would sign a
writing, obliging himself to go to sea within thirty
days after his release, under the penalty of being
proceeded against as a felon. The alternative
was either to undergo this voluntary exile, or
remain in prison disowned and deserted by every
body, and after all suffer an ignominious trial,
that might end in a sentence of transportation
for life. He therefore, without much hesitation,
embraced the proposal of his kinsman, and (as
he observed) was in less than a month after his
discharge turned adrift to the mercy of the wind
and waves.</P>
<P>Since that period he had never maintained any
correspondence with his relations, all of whom
had concurred in sending him off; nor would he
<PB N="114" REF="122"/>
ever pay the least regard to the humiliations and
supplications of some among them, who had
prostrated themselves before him, on the advance∣ment
of his fortune: but he retained a most in∣veterate
resentment for his uncle, who was still
in being, tho' extremely old and infirm, and fre∣quently
mentioned his name with all the bitter∣ness
of revenge.</P>
<P>Perry being perfectly well acquainted with the
particulars of this story, which he had heard so
often repeated, proposed to Hatchway, that a
person should be hired to introduce himself to the
commodore, with a supposititious letter of recom∣mendation
from this detested kinsman; an im∣position
that, in all likelihood, would afford
abundance of diversion.</P>
<P>The lieutenant relished the scheme, and young
Pickle having composed an epistle for the occa∣sion,
the exciseman of the parish, a fellow of
great impudence and some humour, in whom
Hatchway could confide▪ undertook to tran∣scribe
and deliver it with his own hand, and also
personate the man in whose favour i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was feigned
to be writ. He, accordingly, one morning ar∣rived
on horseback at the garrison, two hours at
least before Trunnion used to get up, and gave
Pipes, who admitted him, to understand that he
had a letter for his master, which he was ordered
to deliver to none but the commodore himself.
This message was no sooner communicated, than
the indignant chief (who had been waked for the
purpose) began to curse the messenger for break∣ing
his rest, and swore he would not budge till
his usual time of turning out. This resolution
being conveyed to the stranger, he desired the
carrier to go back and tell him, he had such joy∣ful
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
tidings to impart, that he was sure the com∣modore
would think himself amply rewarded for
his trouble, even if he had been raised from the
grave to receive them.</P>
<P>This assurance, flattering as it was, would not
have been powerful enough to persuade him, had
it not been assisted with the exhortations of his
spouse, which never failed to influence his con∣duct.
He therefore crept out of bed, tho' not
without great repugnance, and wrapping himself
in his morning-gown, was supported down stairs,
rubbing his eye, yawning fearfully, and grumbling
all the way. As soon as he popt his head into
the parlour, the supposed stranger made divers
awkward bows, and with a grinning aspect ac∣costed
him in these words: “Your most humble
servant, most noble commodore! I hope you are
in good health; you look pure and hearty; and
if it was not for that misfortune of your eye,
one would not desire to see a more pleasant coun∣tenance
in a summer's day. Sure as I am a living
soul, one would take you to be on this side of three∣score.
Laud help us! I should have known you
to be a Trunnion if I had met with you in
the midst of Salisbury-plain, as the saying is.”
The commodore, who was not at all in the hu∣mour
of relishing such an impertinent preamble,
interrupted him in this place, saying with a
peevish accent, “Pshaw! pshaw! brother, there's
no occasion to bowss out so much unnecessary
gum; if you can't bring your discourse to bear
on the right subject, you had much better clap
a stopper on your tongue, and bring yourself up,
d'ye see: I was told you had something to de∣liver.”
“Deliver! (cried the waggish impostor)
odds heart! I have got something for you that
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
will make your very intrails rejoice within your
body. Here's a letter from a dear and worthy friend
of yours. Take, read it and be happy. Blessings
on his old heart! one would think he had re∣newed
his age, like the eagles.” Trunnion's
expectation being thus raised, he called for his
spectacles, adjusted them to his eye, took the
letter, and being curio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to know the subscrip∣tion▪
no sooner perceived his uncle's name, than
he started back, his lip quivered, and he began
to shake in every limb with resentment and sur∣prize:
nevertheless, eager to know the subject
of an epistle from a person who had never before
troubled him with any sort of address, he endea∣voured
to recollect himself, and perused the con∣tents,
which were these;</P>

<P>It would be a difficult task for the inimitable
Hogarth himself to exhibit the ludicrous expres∣sion
of the commodore's countenance, while
he read this letter. It was not a stare of astonish∣ment,
a convulsion of rage, or a ghastly grin of
revenge, but an association of all three, that took
possession of his features. At length he hawked
up, with incredible straining, the interjection
ah! that seemed to have stuck some time in his
windpipe, and thus gave vent to his indignation:
“Have I come along side of you at last, you
old stinking curmudgeon! you lie, you lousy
hulk, ye lie! you did all in your power to
founder me when I was a stripling; and as for
being graceless, and wicked, and keeping bad
company, you tell a damned lie again, you
thief; there was not a more peaceable lad in the
county, and I kept no bad company but your
own, d'ye see. Therefore, you Trickle, or
what's your name, tell the old rascal that sent
you hither, that I spit in his face, and call him
<HI>Horse;</HI> that I tear his letter into rags, so; and
that I trample upon it as I would upon his own
villainous carcase, d'ye see.” So saying, he
danced in a sort of frenzy upon the fragments of
the paper which he had scattered about the room,
to the inexpressible satisfaction of the triumvirate,
who beheld the scene.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="126"/>
The exciseman having got between him and
the door, which was left open for his escape, in
case of necessity, affected great confusion and
surprize at this behaviour, saying, with an air of
mortification, “Lord, be merciful unto me!
is this the way you treat your own relations,
and the recommendation of your best friend?
Surely all gratitude and virtue has left this sinful
world! What will cousin Tim, and Dick, and
Tom, and good mother Pipkin, and her daugh∣ters,
cousin Sue, and Prue, and Peg, with all
the rest of our kinsfolks say, when they hear of
this unconscionable reception that I have met
with. Consider, Sir, that ingratitude is worse
than the sin of witchcraft, as the apostle wisely
observes; and do not send me away with such
unchristian usage, which will lay a heavy load of
guilt upon your poor miserable soul.” “What
you are on the cruize for a post, brother Trickle,
an't ye? (said Trunnion, interrupting him) we
shall find a post for you in a trice, my boy.
Here, Pipes, take this saucy son of a bitch,
belay him to the whipping post in the yard. I'll
teach you to rowce me in a morning with such
impertinent messages.” Pipes, who wanted to
carry the joke farther than the exciseman dreamt
of, laid hold on him in a twinkling, and exe∣cuted
the orders of his commander, notwith∣standing
all his nods, winking, and significant
gestures, which the boatswain's mate would by
no means understand: so that he began to repent
of the part he acted in this performance, which
was like to end so tragically, and stood fastened
to the stake, in a very disagreeable state of sus∣pence;
casting many a rueful look over his left
shoulder, (while Pipes was absent in quest of a
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
cat and nine tails) in expectation of being re∣lieved
by the interposition of the lieutenant, who
did not▪ however, appear; and Tom returning
with the instrument of correction, undressed the
delinquent in a trice, and whispering in his ear,
that he was very sorry for being employed in such
an office, but durst not for his soul disobey the
orders of his commander, flourished the scourge
about his head, and with admirable dexterity
made such a smarting application to the offenders
back and shoulders, that the distracted gauger
performed sundry new cuts with his feet, and
bellowed hideously with pain, to the infinite sa∣tisfaction
of the spectators. At length, when he
was almost flead from his rump to the nape of
his neck, Hatchway, who had purposely absented
himself hitherto, appeared in the yard, and in∣terposing
in his behalf, prevailed upon Trunnion
to call off the executioner, and order the male∣factor
to be released.</P>
<P>The exciseman, mad with the catastrophe he
had undergone, threatened to be revenged upon
his employers, by making a candid confession of
the whole plot; but the lieutenant giving him to
understand, that in so doing he would bring up∣on
himself a prosecution for fraud, forgery and
imposture, he was fain to put up with his loss,
and sneaked out of the garrison, attended with a
volley of curses discharged upon him by the com∣modore,
who was exceedingly irritated by the
disturbance and disappointment he had under∣gone.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The commodore detects the machinations of the con∣spirators,
and hires a tutor for Peregrine, whom
he settles at Winchester school.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was not the last affliction he suffered
from the unwearied endeavours and inex∣hausted
invention of his tormentors, who har∣rassed
him with such a variety of mischievous
pranks, that he began to think all the devils in
hell had conspired against his peace; and accord∣ingly
became very serious and contemplative on
the subject.</P>
<P>In the course of his meditations, when he re∣collected
and compared the circumstances of
every mortification to which he had been lately
exposed, he could not help suspecting that some
of them must have been contrived to vex him;
and as he was not ignorant of his lieutenant's dis∣position,
nor unacquainted with the talents of
Peregrine, he resolved to observe them both for
the future with the utmost care and circum∣spection.
This resolution, aided by the incau∣tious
conduct of the conspirators, whom, by this
time, success had rendered heedless and indiscreet,
was attended with the desired effect. He in a little
time detected Perry in a new plot, and by dint of
a little chastisement, and a great many threats,
extorted from him a confession of all the con∣trivances
in which he had been concerned. The
commodore was thunderstruck at the discovery,
and so much incensed against Hatchway for the
part he had acted in the whole, that he deliberated
with himself, whether he should demand satis∣faction
<PB N="121" REF="129"/>
with sword and pistol, or dismiss him from
the garison, and renounce all friendship with
him at once. But he had been so long accustomed
to Jack's company, that he could not live with∣out
him; and upon more cool reflection, per∣ceiving
that what he had done was rather the
effect of wantonness than malice, which he him∣self
would have laughed to see take place upon
any other person, he determined to devour his
chagrin, and extend his forgiveness even to Pipes,
whom in the first sally of his passion he had
looked upon in a more criminal light than that
of a simple mutineer. This determination was
seconded by another, which he thought abso∣lutely
necessary for his own repose, and in which
his own interest and that of his nephew con∣curred.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was now turned of twelve,
had made such advances under the instruction of
Je<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nings, that he often disputed upon grammar,
and was sometimes thought to have the better
in his contests with the parish-priest, who, not∣withstanding
this acknowledged superiority of his
antagonist, did great justice to his genius, which
he assured Mr. Trunnion would be lost for want
of cultivation, if the boy was not immediately
sent to prosecute his studies at some proper semi∣nary
of learning.</P>
<P>This maxim had more than once been inculcated
upon the commodore by Mrs. Trunnion, who, over
and above the deference she paid to the parson's
opinion, had a reason of her own for wishing to see
the house clear of Peregrine, at whose prying dispo∣sition
she began to be very uneasy. Induced by
these motives, which were joined by the sollici∣tation
of the youth himself, who ardently longed
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
to see a little more of the world, his uncle deter∣mined
to send him forthwith to Winchester, under
the immediate care and inspection of a governor,
to whom he allowed a very handsome appointment
for that purpose. This gentleman, whose name
was Mr. Jacob Jolter, had been schoolfellow
with the parson of the parish, who recommend∣ed
him to Mrs. Trunnion as a person of great
worth and learning, in every respect qualified for
the office of a tutor. He likewise added, by
way of eulogium, that he was a man of exem∣plary
piety, and particularly zealous for the ho∣nour
of the church of which he was a member,
having been many years in holy orders, tho' he
did not then exercise any function of the priest∣hood.
Indeed, Mr. Jolter's zeal was so exceed∣ingly
servent, as, on some occasions, to get the
better of his discretion: for, being an high-churchman,
and of consequence a malecontent,
his resentment was habituated into an insur∣mountable
prejudice against the present dispo∣sition
of affairs, which, by confounding the na∣tion
with the ministry, sometimes led him into
erroneous, not to say absurd calculations; Other∣wise,
a man of good morals, well versed in ma∣thematicks
and school-divinity, studies which had
not at all contributed to sweeten and unbend the natural
sourness and severity of his complexion.</P>
<P>This gentleman being destined to the charge
of superintending Perry's education, every thing
was prepared for their departure; and Tom
Pipes, in consequence of his own petition, put
into livery, and appointed footman to the young
squire. But, before they set out, the commo∣dore
paid the compliment of communicating his
design to Mr. Pickle, who approved of the plan,
<PB N="123" REF="131"/>
tho' he durst not venture to see the boy; so
much was he intimidated by the remonstrances
of his wife, whose aversion to her first-born be∣came
every day more inveterate and unaccount∣able.
This unnatural caprice seemed to be sup∣ported
by a consideration which (one would ima∣gine)
might have rather vanquished her disgust.
Her second son Gam, who was now in the fourth
year of his age, had been ricketty from the
cradle, and as remarkably unpromising in ap∣pearance
as Perry was agreeable in his person.
As the deformity increased, the mother's fond∣ness
was augmented, and the virulence of her
hate against the other son seemed to prevail in
the same proportion.</P>
<P>Far from allowing Perry to enjoy the com∣mon
privileges of a child, she would not suffer
him to approach his father's house, expressed un∣easiness
whenever his name happened to be men∣tioned,
sickened at his praise, and in all respects
behaved like a most rancorous step-mother. Tho'
she no longer retained that ridiculous notion of
his being an impostor, she still continued to ab∣hor
him, as if she really believed him to be
such; and when any person desired to know the
cause of her surprising dislike, she always lost
her temper, and peevishly replied, that she had
reasons of her own, which she was not obliged
to declare: nay, so much was she infected by
this vicious partiality, that she broke off all com∣merce
with her sister-in-law and the commodore,
because they favoured the poor child with their
countenance and protection.</P>
<P>Her malice, however, was frustrated by the
love and generosity of Trunnion, who having
adopted him as his own son, equipped him ac∣cordingly,
<PB N="124" REF="132"/>
and carried him and his governor in
his own coach to the place of destination, where
they were settled on a very genteel footing, and
every thing regulated according to their desires.</P>
<P>Mrs. Trunnion behaved with great decency at
the departure of her nephew, to whom, with a
great many pious advices, and injunctions to be∣have
with submission and reverence towards his
tutor, she presented a diamond ring of small va∣lue,
and a gold medal, as tokens of her affection
and esteem. As for the lieutenant, he accom∣panied
them in the coach; and such was the
friendship he had contracted for Perry, that when
the commodore proposed to return, after having
accomplished the intent of his journey, Jack ab∣solutely
refused to attend him, and signified his
resolution to stay where he was.</P>
<P>Trunnion was the more startled at this de∣claration,
as Hatchway was become so neces sary
to him in almost all the purposes of his life, that
he foresaw he should not be able o exist without
his company. Not a little affected with this
consideration, he turned his eye ruefully upon
the lieutenant, saying in a piteous tone, “What!
leave me at last, Jack, after we have weathered
so many hard gales together? D—n my limbs!
I thought you had been more of an honest heart:
I looked upon you as my foremast, and Tom
Pipes as my mizzen; now he is carried away,
if so be as you go too, my standing rigging be∣ing
decayed, d'ye see, the first squall will bring
me by the board. D—n ye, if in case I have
given offence, can't ye speak above-board? and
I shall make you amends.”</P>
<P>Jack being ashamed to own the true situation
of his thoughts, after some hesitation, answered
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>
with perplexity and incoherence, “No, damme!
that an't the case neither: to be sure you always
used me in an officer-like manner, that I must
own, to give the devil his due, as the saying is;
but for all that, this here is the case, I have some
thoughts of going to school myself to learn your
Latin lingo; for, as the saying is, <HI>Better late
mend than never do well:</HI> and I am informed as
how one can get more for the money here than
any where else.”</P>
<P>In vain did Trunnion endeavour to convince
him of the folly of going to school at his years,
by representing that the boys would make game
of him, and that he would become a laughing-stock
to all the world; he persisted in his reso∣lution
to stay, and the commodore was fain to
have recourse to the mediation of Pipes and Perry,
who employed their influence with Jack, and at
last prevailed upon him to return to the gari∣son,
after Trunnion had promised he should be
at liberty to visit them once a month. This sti∣pulation
being settled, he and his friend took
leave of the pupil, governor and attendant, and
next morning set out for their habitation, which
they reached in safety that same night.</P>
<P>Such was Hatchway's reluctance to leave Pe∣regrine,
that he is said, for the first time in his
life, to have looked misty at parting: certain I
am, that on the road homewards, after a long
pause of silence, which the commodore never
dreamt of interrupting, he exclaimed all of a
sudden, “I'll be damned if the dog han't given
me some stuff to make me love him.” Indeed
there was something congenial in the disposition
of these two friends, which never failed to ma∣nifest
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>
itself in the sequel, howsoever different
their education, circumstances and connexions
happened to be.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine distinguishes himself among his school-fellows,
exposes his tutor, and attracts the par∣ticular
notice of the master.</HEAD>
<P>THUS left to the prosecution of his stu∣dies,
Peregrine was in a little time a di∣stinguished
character, not only for his acuteness
of apprehension, but also for that mischievous
fertility of fancy, of which we have already gi∣ven
such pregnant examples. But as there was
a great number of such luminaries in this new
sphere to which he belonged, his talents were not
so conspicuous, while they shone in his single
capacity, as they afterwards appeared, when they
concentrated and reflected the rays of the whole
constellation.</P>
<P>At first he confined himself to piddling game,
exercising his genius upon his own tutor, who
attracted this attention, by endeavouring to sea∣son
his mind with certain political maxims, the
fallacy of which he had discernment enough to
perceive. Scarce a day passed, on which he did
not find means to render Mr. Jolter the object of
ridicule; his violent prejudices, ludicrous vani∣ty,
aukward solemnity and ignorance of man∣kind,
afforded continual food for the raillery, pe∣tulance
and satire of his pupil, who never neg∣lected
an opportunity of laughing, and making
others laugh at his expence.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="135"/>
Sometimes in their parties, by mixing brandy
in his wine, he decoyed this pedagogue into a
debauch, during which his caution forsook him,
and he exposed himself to the censure of the
company. Sometimes, when the conversation
turned upon intricate subjects, he practised upon
him the Socratic method of confutation, and,
under pretence of being informed, by an artful
train of puzzling questions, insensibly betrayed
him into self-contradiction: and at one time
he, in a most dexterous manner, set on foot a
correspondence between him and the chamb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣maid
of the house, which ended in his utter
shame and confusion. The wench was hand∣some,
Jolter was frail; and one evening, while
in his cups, beheld her with a carnal eye.</P>
<P>Perry, who was ever on the catch, discovered
his longing, and prevailed upon the object of his
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion to seed his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ame with small favours, until
it became too violent to be restrained: he then
urged his addresses with redoubled ardor, pro∣mised,
vowed, bribed and intreated; the inamora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
seemed to yield, and blessed him with a declara∣tion,
that her chamber-door should be left open
at midnight.</P>
<P>True to the assignation, he rose at the hour
appointed, and full of the most vigorous expec∣tation,
in his shirt, darkling explored his way to
the place of rendezvous. His heart throbbed
with joy when he found immediate admittance;
he saw the cap of his Dulcinea, who seemed to
be asleep; he sprung into bed, and clasped in his
arms—oh heavens! no other than the
traitor Pipes, who, by his master's direction, per∣sonated
the maid; and returned the embrace
with such muscular contraction, that the unfor∣tunate
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
lover felt the disappointment, and the im∣possibility
of dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngaging himself, at the same
time. His malicious pupil, attended by another
scholar who lived in the same house, and the sly
jilt who was the cause of this disaster, imme∣diately
entered the room with lights, and detected
the forlorn governor in all the mortification of
disgrace.</P>
<P>This adventure destroyed all the remains of
authority which he had hitherto preserved over
Peregrine; so that, for the future, no sort of ce∣remony
subsisted between them, and all Mr. Jol∣ter's
precepts were conveyed in hints of friendly
advice, which the other might either follow or
neglect at his own pleasure. No wonder then
that Peregrine gave a loose to his inclinations,
and by dint of genius and an enterprising temper,
made a figure among the younger class of heroes
in the college.</P>
<P>Before he had been a fully year at Winchester,
he had signalized himself in so many atchieve∣ments,
in defiance to the laws and regulations of
the place, that he was looked upon with admi∣ration,
and actually chosen <HI>Dux,</HI> or leader, by
a large body of his cotemporaries. It was not
long before his same reached the ears of the ma∣ster,
who sent for Mr. Jolter, communicated to
him the informations he had received, and de∣sired
him to check the vivacity of his charge, and
redouble his vigilance in time to come, else he
should be obliged to make a public example of
his pupil for the benefit of the school.</P>
<P>The governor, conscious of his won unim∣portance,
was not a little disconcerted at this in∣juction,
which it was not in his power to fulfil
by any compulsive means. He therefore went
<PB N="129" REF="137"/>
home in a very pensive mood, and after mature
deliberation, resolved to expostulate with Pere∣grine
in the most familiar terms, and endeavour
to dissuade him from practices which might affect
his character as well as interest. He accordingly
frankly told him the subject of the master's dis∣course,
represented the disgrace he might incur
by neglecting this warning; and putting him in
mind of his won situation, hinted the conse∣quences
of the commodore's displeasure, in case
he should be brought to disapprove of his con∣duct.
These insinuations made the greater im∣pression,
as they were delivered with many ex∣pressions
of friendship and concern. The young
gentleman was not so raw, but that he could per∣ceive
the solidity of Mr. Jolter's advice, to which
he promised to conform, because his pride was in∣terested
in the affair; and he considered his own
reformation as the only means of avoiding that
infamy which even in idea he could not bear.</P>
<P>His governor finding him so reasonable, pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted
by these moments of reflection, and in or∣der
to prevent a relapse, proposed that he should
engage in some delightful study that would agree∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
amuse his imagination, and gradually de∣tach
him from those connexions which had in∣volved
him in so many troublesome adventures.
For this purpose, he, with many rapturous en∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miums,
recommended the mathematics, as
yielding more rational and sensible pleasure to a
youthful fancy than any other subject of contem∣plation;
and actually began to read Euclid with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m that same afternoon.</P>
<P>Peregrine entered upon this branch of learning
with all that warmth of application which boys
commonly yield on the first change of study;
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
but he had scarce advanced beyond the <HI>Pons Asi∣norum,</HI>
when his ardor abated, the test of truth
by demonstration did not elevate him to those
transports of joy with which his preceptor had
regaled his expectation; and before he arrived
at the fortieth and seventh proposition, he began
to yawn drearily, make abundance of wry faces,
and thought himself but indifferently paid for his
attention, when he shared the vast discovery of
Pyt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>azor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and understood that the square of
the hypothenuse was equal to the squares of the
other two sides of a right angled triangle. He
was ashamed, however, to fail in his undertaking,
and persevered with great industry, until he had
finished the first four books, acquired plain tri∣gonomet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,
with the method of algebraical cal∣culation,
and made himself well acquained with
the principles of surveying. But no considera∣tion
could prevail upon him to extend his inquiries
farther in this science; and he returned with
double relish to his former avocations, like a
stream which being dammed, accumulates more
force, and bursting o'er its mounds, rushes down
with double impetuosity.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter saw with astonishment and chagrin,
but could not resist the torrent. His behaviour
was now no other than a se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of licence and ef∣fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tery;
prank succeeded prank, and outrage
followed outrage with surprising velocity. Com∣plaints
were every day preferred against him; in
vain were adm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nitions bestowed by the governor
in private, and menaces discharged by the masters
in publick; he disregarded the first, despised the
latter, divested himself of all manner of restraint,
and proceeded in his career to such a pitch of au∣dacity,
that a consultation was held upon the sub∣ject,
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
in which it was determined that this unto∣ward
spirit should be humbled by a severe and ig∣nominious
flogging for the very next offence he
should commit; and in the mean time that Mr. Jolter
should be desired to write in the master's
name to the commodore, requesting him to re∣move
Tom Pipes from the person of his nephew,
the said Pipes being a principal actor and abettor
in all his malversations; and to put a stop to the
monthly visitations of the mutilated lieutenant,
who had never once failed to use his permission,
but came punctual to a day, always fraught with
some new invention. Indeed, by this time, Mr.
Hatchway was as well known, and much better
beloved by every boy in the school than the ma∣ster
who instructed him, and always received by
a number of the scholars who used to attend
Peregrine when he went forth to meet his friend,
and conduct him to his lodging with public testi∣monies
of joy and applause.</P>
<P>As for Tom Pipes he was not so properly the
attendant of Peregrine, as master of the revels to
the whole school. He mingled in all their parties,
and superintended the diversions, deciding be∣tween
boy and boy, as if he acted by commission
under the great seal. He regulated their motions
by his whistle, instructed the young boys in the
games of hussle-cap, leap-frog, and chuck far∣thing;
imparted to those of a more advanced age
the sciences of cribbidge and all-fours, together
with the method of storming the castle, acting
the comedy of Prince Arthur, and other panto∣mimes,
as they are commonly exhibited at sea;
and instructed the seniors who were distinguished
by the appellation of bloods, in cudgel-playing,
dancing the St. Giles's hornpipe, drinking flip
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
and smoaking tobacco. These qualifications had
rendered him so necessary and acceptable to the
scholars, that exclusive of Perry's concern in the
affair, his dismission in all probability, would have
produced some dangerous convulsion in the com∣munity.
Jolter, therefore, knowing his impor∣tance,
informed his pupil of the directions he had
received, and very candidly asked how he should
demean himself in the execution; for he durst not
write to the commodore without this previous
notice, fearing that the young gentleman, as soon
as he should get an inkling of the affair, would
follow the example, and make his uncle ac∣quainted
with certain anecdotes, which it was the
governor's interest to keep concealed. Peregrine
was of opinion that he should spare himself the
trouble of conveying any complaints to the com∣modore;
and if questioned by the master, assure
him he had complied with his desire; at the same
time he promised faithfully to conduct himself
with such circumspection for the future, that the
masters should have no temptation to revive the
inquiry. But the resolution attending this ex∣torted
promise was too frail to last, and in less
than a fortnight our young hero found himself
intangled in an adventure from which he was not
extricated with his usual good fortune.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He is concerned in a dangerous adventure with a
certain gardener; heads an insurrection in the
school; takes the field with his adherents, marches
up into the country, and fixes his head quarters at
an inn.</HEAD>
<P>HE and some of his companions one day en∣tered
a garden in the suburbs, and having
indulged their appetites, desired to know what sa∣tisfaction
they must make for the fruit they had
pulled. The gardener demanded what (in their
opinion) was an exorbitant price, and they with
many opprobious terms refused to pay it. The
peasant being surly and intractable, insisted upon
his right; neither was he deficient or sparing in
the eloquence of vulgar abuse. His guests at∣tempted
to retreat, a scuffle ensued, in which Pe∣regrine
lost his cap, and the gardener being in
danger from the number of his foes, called to his
wife to let loose the dog, who instantly flew to
his master's assistance; and after having tore the
leg of one, and the shoulder of another, put the
whole body of scholars to flight. Enraged at the
indignity which had been offered to them, they
solicited a reinforcement of their friends, and with
Tom Pipes at their head, marched back to the
field of battle. Their adversary seeing them ap∣proach,
called his apprentice, who worked at the
other end of the ground, to his assistance, armed
him with a mattock, while he himself wielded an
hoe, bolted his door on the inside, and flanked
with his man and mastiff, waited the attack with∣out
flinching. He had not remained three minutes
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
in this posture of defence, when Pipes, who acted
as the enemy's forlorn hope, advanced to the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
with great intrepidity, and clapping his foot to the
door, which was none of the stoutest, with the
execution and dispatch of a petard, split it into a
thousand pieces. This sudden execution had an
immediate effect upon the 'prentice, who re∣treated
with great precipitation, and escaped at
a postern gate. But the master placed himself
like another Hercules in the breach; and when
Pipes brandishing his cudgel, stepped forward to
engage him, levelled his weapon with such force
and dexterity at his head, that had the skull been
made of penetrable stuff, the iron edge must have
cleft his pate in twain. Casemated as he was,
the instrument cut sheer even to the bone, on
which it struck with such amazing violence, that
sparks of real fire were produced by the collision.
And let not the incredulous reader pretend to
doubt the truth of this phaenomenon, until he
shall have first perused the ingenious Peter Kol∣ben's
Natural History of the Cape of Good Hope,
where the inhabitants commonly use to strike
fire with the shin-bones of lions which have been
killed in that part of Africk.</P>
<P>Pipes, though a little disconcerted, far from
being disabled by the blow, in a trice retorted
the compliment with his truncheon, which, had
not his antagonist expeditiously slipped his head
aside, would have laid him breathless across his
own threshold; but, happily for him, he received
the salutation upon his right shoulder, which
crashed beneath the stroke, and the hoe dropped
instantly from his tingling hand. Tom perceiv∣ing,
and being unwilling to forego the advantage
he had gained, darted his head into the bosom of
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
this son of earth, and overturned him on the
plain, being himself that instant assaulted by the
mastif, who fastened upon the outside of his
thigh. Feeling himself incommoded by this as∣sailant
in his rear, he quitted the prostrate gar∣dener
to the resentment of his associates, who
poured upon him in shoals, and turning about,
laid hold with both his hands of this ferocious
animal's throat, which he squeezed with such in∣credible
force and perseverance, that the creature
quitted his hold; his tongue lolled out of his
jaws, the blood started from his eyes, and he
swung a li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eless trunk between the hands of his
vanquisher.</P>
<P>It was well for his master that he did not
longer exist; for by this time he was over∣whelmed
by such a multitude of foes, that his
whole body scarce afforded points of contact to
all the fist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that drummed upon it, consequently,
to use a vulgar phrase, his wind was almost knock∣ed
out, before Pipes had leisure to interpose in his
behalf, and persuade had offenders to desist, by
representing that the wife had gone to alarm the
neighbourhood, and that in all probability, they
would be intercepted in their return. They ac∣cordingly
listened to his remonstrances, and
marched homewards in triumph, leaving the gar∣dener
in the embraces of his mother earth, from
which he had not power to move when he was
found by his disconsolate helpmate and some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom she had assembled for his assistance.
Among these was a blacksmith and farrier, who
took cognizance of his carcase, every limb of
which having examined, he declared there was
no bone broke, and taking out his fleam, blooded
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im plentifully as he lay. He was then conveyed
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
to his bed, from which he was not able to stir
during a whole month, and his family coming
upon the parish, a formal complaint was made to
the master of the college, and Peregrine repre∣sented
as the ring-leader of those who committed
this barbarous assault. An inquiry was immedi∣ately
set on foot, and the articles of impeachment
being fully proved, our hero was sentenced to be
severely chastised in the face of the whole school.
This was a disgrace the thoughts of which his
proud heart could not brook. He resolved to make
his elopement rather than undergo the punish∣ment
to which he was doomed; and having sig∣nified
his sentiments to his confederates, they pro∣mised,
one an all, to stand by him, and either
screen him from chastisement, or share his fate.</P>
<P>Confiding in this friendly protestation, he ap∣peared
unconcerned on the day that was appointed
for his punishment; and when he was called to
his destiny, advanced towards the scene, attended
by the greatest part of the scholars, who inti∣mated
their determination to the master, and
proposed that Peregrine should be forgiven. The
superior behaved with that dignity of demeanor
which became his place, represented the folly and
presumption of their demand, reprehended them
for their audacious proceeding, and ordered every
boy to his respective station; but they had gone
too far to retract, and instead of obeying the in∣junction
they had received, marched directly out
of the college, with their captain in the midst of
them, and halting on a rising ground at the distance
of a short mile from town, held a council
to deliberate on what was to be done.</P>
<P>This consultation was too tumultuous to end
in any unanimous decision, so that Mr. Pickle
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
put himself at their head, and proceeded straight
forward till the hurry and confusion that pre∣vailed
among them should subside; while Tom
Pipes, who had by this time joined the company,
brought up the rear with great calmness and tran∣quillity,
and never once inquired into the reason
of this extraordinary migration. They pursued
this indeterminate course for six miles, when a
public-house presenting itself to their view, there
was a proposal made to halt for refreshment, and
they disposed of themselves accordingly, as the
conveniencies of the place would permit. Having
made a very hearty breakfast on bread and butter
and cheese, which they took care to dilute with
a proportionable quantity of ale; a motion was
made for holding another board, from which the
younger boys were excluded, that they might,
as much as possible, avoid clamour and distrac∣tion
in their counsels. Here Peregrine being in∣vested
with the supreme command, made a pub∣lic
speech to his constituents, wherein having
thanked them for their generous interposition in
his favour, and the great honour they now con∣ferred
upon him, he observed that in all likeli∣hood,
they should in a little time reap the fruits
of their resolution, and be recalled with honour
to the studies they had left; but as it would be
necessary to persevere a little longer, that the
masters might see they were not mere boys whom
they had disobliged, he proposed that they should
dismiss the minor brothers who were not capable
of enduring a little fatigue, and deposit all their
money in the hands of one person who should be
chosen for that trust, and to regulate their ex∣pence
upon the road; while they advanced far∣ther
into the country, and waited patiently for
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
the terms which would undoubtedly be propound∣ed
unto them. The proposal was unanimously
embraced, the money produced, to the amount of
ten guineas, and put into the hands of Pipes, who
was elected caterer and purser to the whole com∣munity;
and the young boys being exhorted to
return, the rest, to the number of five and
twenty, departed under the auspices of Peregrine,
who conducted them ten miles farther to a certain
village, where they took up their lodging at an
inn, and bespoke something hot for supper; after
which they called for punch and strong beer, and
indulged themselves in such intemperance, that
in a little time riot and disorder prevailing, they
sallied forth in quest of willing dames to crown
their enjoyment, and committed many other ex∣cesses
which the prudence and authority of Pere∣grine
could not restrain.</P>
<P>In the morning the landlord saved them the
trouble of calling for a bill, and they had the mor∣tification
to see that their night's extravagance had
mounted up their expence to one half of their
whole stock. They discharged the reckoning,
and as few or none of them had any inclination
or appetite for breakfast, put themselves in mo∣tion,
and marched onwards for seven miles before
they made another halt. This happened on the
edge of a common, where they perceived the
sign of the George, to the no small comfort and
satisfaction of some among them, whose tongues
by this time cleaved to the roofs of their mouths,
in consequence of the debauch of last night. Here
then they paused, and having moistened their
throats with plentiful streams of ale, began to re∣lish
the situation, and ordered their steward to
provide something for dinner. The people of the
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>
house would have gladly dispensed with their cus∣tom,
as they had no great faith either in the finan∣ces
or principles of their guests, who seemed too
young to be possessed of much money or conside∣ration.
But as they lived in a solitary place, un∣provided
with defence against the insults to which
they might be exposed from the resentment of
such a disorderly crowd, they would not venture
to signify their distrust, and lamented that there
was nothing in the house with which they could
entertain them. Tom Pipes, who had observed
a flock of geese upon the common, and abundance
of poultry in the yard, took no notice of the
landlord's declaration, but went out, and in less
than five mintues returned with provision suffici∣ent
to regale twice the number of his associates.
The woman durst not venture to disapprove of
what he had done, but after having assured him
that the fowls were none of her own, very peace∣ably
employed her whole family in preparing
them for the fire, and some bacon and greens be∣ing
added to the repast, our company disposed
themselves in different groups upon the grass, and
dined with great mirth and satisfaction, without
once recollecting that another such meal would
utterly exhaust their common fund. However,
this sweet insensibility did not long prevail; about
four o'clock they called to pay, and were very
much startled to find themselves charged no less
than two pounds eleven and sixpence for the en∣tertainment
they had received. They looked
upon this reckoning as unconscionable, and dis∣puted
every article accordingly; but the landlady
solemnly protested that the sum would barely in∣demnify
her, and imputed great part of the charge
to the unnecessary number of geese and chickens
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
which had been slaughtered without her know∣ledge
or consent.</P>
<P>Pipes, who on certain subjects, thought a lit∣tle
too much at large, proposed to punish her
for her exorbitant demand, by marching off
without paying one farthing; but this advice Pe∣regrine
declined with disdain, looking upon su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
an expedient as inconsistent with the dignity of
the corps which he had the honour to command;
and ordered that the bill should be immedi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tely
discharged. This affair being settled to the satis∣faction
of all parties concerned, they resumed
their march, and in the evening arrived at a cer∣tain
market town, where they resolved to fix
their quarters until they should hear tidings from
the college which they had left. With this view
they chose their residence at the best inn belong∣ing
to the place, and determined to manage the
remains of their fortune with great frugality. But
the spirits of some amongst them beginning to
flag, in consequence of the fatigue of their jour∣ney,
and their own reflection that now represented
the folly of their design, with the uncomfortable
circumstances that must in a few hours attend the
consumption of their stock; this prudent scheme
of oeconomy was over-ruled, a huge bowl of
punch prepared, and Pipes ordered to enliven the
company with a song. Their cares were in a
little time overwhelmed, and the greatest part of
the night was consumed in mirth and jollity;
though next morning they waked in the horrors,
and universal despondence took place, when they
learnt that their bank was scarce able to defray
the expence of their bill, which they received next
their stomachs, and were obliged to discharge.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="149"/>
They were now reduced to a dilemma that
occasioned another general consultation, in which
they agreed to club their pocket-pieces and silver
buckles for present support, and give notice by
letters of their situation to their respective rela∣tions,
taking care to ascribe their distress to the
ill usage they had met with at school: on this oc∣casion
Peregrine produced the ring and medal he
had received from Mrs. Trunnion, and Pipes not
only presented his own purse, which was pretty
well furnished, but even made a proffer of his
silver whistle, with the chain by which it had for
many years depended from his neck. They
thanked him for his disinterested attachment, but
all his sollicitations could not prevail upon the
chiefs to profit by this instance of his good fel∣lowship;
because they considered him as a person
whose assistance in this particular it was neither
just nor honourable to use.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The governors tamper with their pupils. Peregrine
is deserted, prevailed upon to return, and submit
to correction; sublimes his ideas, commences gal∣lant,
and becomes acquainted with Miss Emily
Gauntlet.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while the master, surprised and
disconcerted at such an unprecedented se∣cession,
convened all the tutors of those who
were concerned in this dangerous association, in
order to concert proper measures for recalling
them; and after mature deliberation, as it was
the opinion of every body, that such a number
of raw, hot-headed boys, without money, con∣duct,
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>
experience or plan, could not possibly co∣here
for any length of time, they resolved to
leave them to the operation of their own pas∣sions;
not doubting that as the first impulse
gradually weakened, they would drop off one by
one, and the whole confederacy be thus melted
down. The return of the young boys justified
the prognostic; but the masters were not a little
alarmed, when they understood that the rest had
chosen a general, submitted to certain regula∣tions,
and adopted a determinate design. They
resolved, nevertheless, to give them a little more
scope, and waited four and twenty hours for the
effect of their forbearance; when hearing no ac∣counts
from the deserters, they began to con∣sider
this revolt as a very serious affair; and in
pursuance of their advice and direction, the go∣vernors
set out in quest of their stray pupils.</P>
<P>It was not difficult to discover the rout they
had taken; such a remarkable caravan could not
pass unheeded; they got intimation of their ad∣vances
from stage to stage, and at night arrived
at an inn that stood on the road, about two
miles short of the town where the adventures
had settled their head quarters. From hence they
repaired in a body to the house of a neighbouring
justice, who, in consequence of their represen∣tations,
granted a warrant to apprehend and se∣cure
the body of Thomas Pipes, as an idle va∣gabond
and seducer of youth. Thus autho∣rised,
they went early next morning to the town,
and set up their horses at another inn, where
they remained <HI>incognito,</HI> until they had engaged
the constable with a competent number of as∣sistants;
then a person was sent to inform Mr.
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>
Pipes, that his company was desired at the White
Hart.</P>
<P>Tom received this message immediately after
the contribution of effects, already mentioned;
and imparted the contents to his master, who
rightly judging that it concerned the common
cause, desired him to obey the summons. He
followed the messenger accordingly; and no
sooner set his nose within the room to which he
was directed, than the constable and his posse
sprung upon him, before he had the least intima∣tion
of his design, or any opportunity of acting
in his own defence.</P>
<P>Thus overpowered, he was made acquainted
with the cause of his being arrested, which, in
all appearance, did not give him a great deal of
concern, and in private committed to jail, where
he was left to his own meditations.</P>
<P>This previous measure being successfully taken,
the tutors went into separate apartments, and
sending for their respective pupils, each plied his
own charge in particular with such arguments as
he judged most conducive to dissuade him from
persevering in the imprudent scheme which he
had already prosecuted too far. No great elo∣quence
was required to accomplish this aim, which
was already more than half effected by their own
reflections; and therefore the greatest part of
them yielded to such reasonable remonstrances,
and consented to return to school, provided they
might be indulged with a general amnesty for
what they had done. This they were impow∣ered
to promise to all of them, except Peregrine,
whom, as ringleader and first cause of this distur∣bance,
the master had marked out for a public
example. For this reason he stood out against
<PB N="144" REF="152"/>
all the admonitions of Mr. Jolter, who in vain
conjured him to put up with a little correction,
rather than run the risk of being ignominiously
expelled, and of forfeiting the friendship of his
uncle, on whom he knew his chief dependance
was built; till at length, seeing his adheren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
persuaded out of their allegiance, and himself
bereft of all company and means of subsistence,
he with great reluctance resigned himself to his
fate; and having obtained the discharge of Pipes,
was reconducted to the college, where, notwith∣standing
the intercession of his governor, who
begged earnestly that his punishment might be
mitigated, our unfortunate hero was publickly
horsed, <HI>in terrorem</HI> of all whom it might concern.</P>
<P>This disgrace had a very sensible effect upon
the mind of Peregrine, who having, by this
time, passed the fourteenth year of his age, be∣gan
to adopt the pride and sentiments of a man.
Thus dishonourably stigmatized, he was ashamed
to appear in public as usual; he was incensed
against his companions for their infidelity and ir∣resolution,
and plunged into a profound reverie
that lasted several weeks▪ during which he shook
off his boyish connections, and fixed his view
upon objects which he thought more worthy of
his attention.</P>
<P>In the course of his gymnastic exercises, at
which he was very expert, he contracted inti∣macies
with several youths who were greatly his
superiors in point of age, and who, pleased with
his aspiring genius and address, introduced him
into parties of gallantry, which strongly capti∣vated
his inclination. He was by nature parti∣cularly
adapted for succeeding in adventures of
this kind; over and above a most engaging person
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>
that improved with his years, he possessed a dig∣nified
assurance, an agreeable ferocity which in∣hanced
the conquest of the fair who had the good
fortune to enslave him, unlimited generosity, and
a fund of humour which never failed to please.
Nor was he deficient in the more solid accom∣plishments
of youth; he had profited in his stu∣dies
beyond expectation, and besides that sen∣sibility
of discernment which is the foundation
of taste, and in consequence of which he di∣stinguished
and enjoyed the beauties of the Clas∣sics,
he had already given several specimens of a
very promising poetic talent.</P>
<P>With this complexion and these qualifications,
no wonder that our hero attracted the notice
and affection of the young Delias in town,
whose hearts had just begun to flutter for they
knew not what. Inquiries were made concern∣ing
his condition; and no sooner were his ex∣pectations
known, than he was invited and ca∣ressed
by all the parents, while their daughters
vyed with each other in treating him with parti∣cular
complacency. He inspired love and emu∣lation
wherever he appeared; envy and jealous
rage followed of course; so that he became a very
desirable, though a very dangerous acquaintance.
His moderation was not equal to his success;
his vanity took the lead of his passions, dissipating
his attention, which might otherwise have fixed
him to one object; and he was possessed with the
rage of increasing the number of his conquests.
With this view he frequented public walks, con∣certs
and assemblies, became remarkably rich and
fashionable in his cloaths, gave entertainments
to the ladies, and was in the utmost hazard of
turning out a most egregious coxcomb.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="154"/>
While his character thus wavered between the
ridicule of some, and the regard of others, an
accident happened, which, by contracting his
view to one object, detached him from those
vain pursuits that would in time have plunged
him into an abyss of folly and contempt. Being
one evening at the ball which is always given to
the ladies at the time of the races, the person
who acted as master of the ceremonies, knowing
how fond Mr. Pickle was of every opportunity
to display himself, came up and told him, that
there was a fine young creature at the other end
of the room, who seemed to have a great incli∣nation
to dance a minuet, but wanted a partner,
the gentleman who attended her being in boots.</P>
<P>Peregrine's vanity being arroused at this inti∣mation,
he went up to reconnoitre the young
lady, and was struck with admiration at her
beauty. She seemed to be of his own age, was
tall, and tho' slender, exquisitely shaped; her
hair was auburn, and in such plenty, that the
barbarity of dress had not been able to pre∣vent
it from shading both sides of her forehead,
which was high and polished; the contour of
her face was oval, her nose very little raised into
the aquiline form, that contributed to the spirit
and dignity of her aspect; her mouth was small,
her lips plump, juicy and delicious, her teeth re∣gular
and white as driven snow, her complexion
incredibly delicate and glowing with health, and
her full blue eyes beamed forth vivacity and love:
her mein was at the same time commanding and
engaging, her address perfectly genteel, and her
whole appearance so captivating, that our young
Adonis looked, and was overcome.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="155"/>
He no sooner recollected himself from his asto∣nishment,
than he advanced to her with a grace∣ful
air of respect, and begged she would do him
the honour to walk a minuet with him. She
seemed particularly pleased with his application,
and very frankly complied with his request. This
pair was too remarkable to escape the particular
notice of the company: Mr. Pickle was well
known by almost every body in the room, but
his partner was altogether a new face, and of
consequence underwent the criticism of all the
ladies in the assembly; one whispered, “She has
a good complexion, but don't you think she is a
little awry?” A second pitied her for her mas∣culine
nose; a third observed, that she was auk∣ward
for want of seeing company; a fourth di∣stinguished
something very bold in her counte∣nance;
and in short, there was not a beauty in
her whole composition, which the glass of envy
did net pervert into a blemish.</P>
<P>The men, however, looked upon her with dif∣ferent
eyes; among them her appearance pro∣duced
an universal murmur of applause; they en∣circled
the space on which she danced, and were
enchanted by her graceful motion. While they
launched out in the praise of her, they expressed
their displeasure at the good fortune of her part∣ner,
whom they damned for a little finical cox∣comb,
that was too much engrossed by the con∣templation
of his own person, to discern or de∣serve
the favour of his fate. He did not hear,
therefore could not repine at these invectives;
but while they imagined he indulged his vanity,
a much more generous passion had taken posses∣sion
of his heart.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156"/>
Instead of that petulance of gaiety for which
he had been distinguished in his public appear∣ance,
he now gave manifest signs of confusion
and concern; he danced with an anxiety which
impeded his performance, and blushed to the
eyes at every false step he made. Though this
extraordinary agitation was overlooked by the
men, it could not escape the observation of the
ladies, who perceived it with equal surprize and
resentment; and when Peregrine led this fair un∣known
to her seat, expressed their pique in an
affected titter, which broke from every mouth
at the same instant, as if all of them had been
informed by the same spirit.</P>
<P>Peregrine was nettled at this unmannerly mark
of disapprobation, and, in order to increase their
chagrin, endeavoured to enter into particular
conversation with their fair rival. The young
lady herself, who neither wanted penetration,
nor the consciousness of her own accomplish∣ments,
resented their behaviour, though she tri∣umphed
at the cause of it, and gave her partner
all the encouragement he could desire. Her mo∣ther,
who was present, thanked him for his ci∣vility
in taking such notice of a stranger, and he
received a compliment of the same nature from
the young gentleman in boots, who was her own
brother.</P>
<P>If he was charmed with her appearance, he
was quite ravished with her discourse, which was
sensible, spirited and gay. Her frank and sprightly
demeanour excited his own confidence and good
humour; and he described to her the characters
of those females who had honoured them with
such a spiteful mark of distinction, in terms so
replete with humorous satire, that she seemed to
<PB N="149" REF="157"/>
listen with particular complacency of attention,
and distinguished every nymph thus ridiculed with
such a significant glance, as overwhelmed her
with chagrin and mortification. In short, they
seemed to relish each other's conversation, during
which our young Damon acquitted himself with
great skill in all the duties of gallantry: he laid
hold of proper opportunities to express his ad∣miration
of her charms, had recourse to the si∣lent
rhetoric of tender looks, breathed divers in∣fidious
sighs, and attached himself wholly to her
during the remaining part of the entertainment.</P>
<P>When the company broke up, he attended
her to her lodgings, and took leave of her with
a squeeze of the hand, after having obtained per∣mission
to visit her next morning, and been in∣formed
by the mother that her name was Miss
Emilia Gauntlet.</P>
<P>All night long he closed not an eye, but
amused himself with plans of pleasure, which his
imagination suggested, in consequence of this
new acquaintance. He arose with the lark, ad∣justed
his air into an agreeable negligence of
curl, and dressing himself in a genteel grey frock
t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>immed with silver binding, waited with the
utmost impatience for the hour of ten, which
no sooner struck, than he hied him to the
place of appointment, and inquiring for Miss
Gauntlet, was shewn into a parlour. Here he
had not waited above ten minutes, when Emilia
entered in a most inchanting undress, with all
the graces of nature playing about her person,
and in a moment rivetted the chains of his sla∣very
beyond the power of accident to unbind.</P>
<P>Her mother being still abed, and her brother
gone to give orders about the chaise, in which
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
they proposed to return that same day to their
own habitation, he enjoyed her company <HI>tête a
tête</HI> a whole hour, during which he declared his
love in the most passionate terms, and begged
that he might be admitted into the number of
those admirers whom she permitted to visit and
adore her.</P>
<P>She affected to look upon his vows and protesta∣tions
as the ordinary effects of gallantry, and very
obligingly assured him, that were she to live in
that place, she should be glad to see him often;
but as the spot on which she resided was at a
considerable distance, she could not expect he
would go so far upon such a trifling occasion, or
take the trouble of providing himself with her
mamma's permission.</P>
<P>To this favourable hint he answered with all
the eagerness of the most fervid passion, that he
had uttered nothing but the genuine dictates of
his heart, and desired nothing so much as an op∣portunity
of evincing the sincerity of his profes∣sions;
and that though she lived at the extre∣mity
of the kingdom, he would find means to
lay himself at her feet, provided he could visit
her with her mother's consent, which he assured
her he would not fail to sollicit.</P>
<P>She then gave him to understand, that her ha∣bitation
was about sixteen miles from Winchester,
in a village which she named, and where (as he
could easily collect from her discourse) he would
be no unwelcome guest.</P>
<P>In the midst of this communication they were
joined by Mrs. Gauntlet, who received him with
great courtesy, thanked him again for his polite∣ness
to Emy at the Ball, and anticipated his in∣tention,
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
by saying that she should be very glad to
see him at her house, if ever his occasions should
call him that way.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He inquires into the situation of this young lady
with whom he is enamoured; elopes from school;
is found by the lieutenant, reconveyed to Win∣chester,
and sends a letter with a copy of verses
to his mistress.</HEAD>
<P>HE was transported with pleasure at this in∣vitation,
which he assured her he should
not neglect; and after a little more conversation
on general topics, took his leave of the charm∣ing
Emilia and her prudent mamma, who had
perceived the first emotions of Mr. Pickle's pas∣sion
for her daughter, and been at some pains to
inquire about his family and fortune.</P>
<P>Neither was Peregrine less inquisitive about
the situation and pedigree of his new mistress,
who, he learned, was the only daughter of a
field-officer, who died before he had it in his
power to make suitable provision for his children;
that the widow lived in a frugal, though decent
manner, on the pension, assisted by the bounty
of her relations; that the son carried arms as vo∣lunteer
in the company which his father had
commanded; and that Emilia had been educated
in London, at the expence of a rich uncle, who
was seized with the whim of marrying at the age
of fifty-five; in consequence of which, his niece
had returned to her mother, without any visible
dependance, except on her own conduct and qua∣lifications.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="160"/>
This account, though it could not diminish
his affection, nevertheless alarmed his pride; for
his warm imagination had exaggerated all his
own prospects; and he began to fear, that his
passion for Emilia might be thought to derogate
from the dignity of his situation. The struggle
between his interest and love produced a per∣plexity
which had an evident effect upon his be∣haviour;
he became pensive, solitary and peevish,
avoided all publick diversions, and grew so re∣markably
negligent in his dress, that he was
scarce distinguishable by his own acquaintance.
This contention of thoughts continued several
weeks, at the end of which the charms of Emi∣lia
triumphed over every other consideration;
and having received a supply of money from the
commodore, who acted towards him with great
generosity, he ordered Pipes to put up some
linnen, and other necessaries, in a sort of knap∣sack
which he could conveniently carry, and
thus attended set out early one morning on foot
for the village where his charmer lived, at which
he arrived before two o'clock in the afternoon;
having chosen this method of travelling, that his
rout might not be so easily discovered, as it must
have been, had he hired horses, or taken a place
in the stage-coach.</P>
<P>The first thing he did was to secure a conve∣nient
lodging at the inn where he dined; then
he shifted himself, and according to the direction
he had received, went to the house of Mrs.
Gauntlet in a transport of joyous expectation.
As he approached the gate his agitation increased,
he knocked with impatience and concern, the
door opened, and he and actually asked if Mrs.
Gauntlet was at home, before he perceived that the
<PB N="153" REF="161"/>
portress was no other than his dear Emilia. She
was not without emotion at the unexpected sight
of her lover, who instantly recognizing his charm∣er,
obeyed the irresistible impulse of his love, and
caught the fair creature in his arms. Nor did
she seem offended at this forwardness of beha∣viour,
which might have displeased another of a
less open disposition, or less used to the freedom
of a sensible education; but her natural frank∣ness
had been encouraged and improved by the
easy and familiar intercourse in which she had
been bred; and therefore, instead of reprimand∣ing
him with a severity of look, she with great
good humour rallied him upon his assurance,
which, she observed, was undoubtedly the effect
of his own conscious merit, and conducted him
into a parlour, where he found her mother, who
in very polite terms expressed her satisfaction at
seeing him within her house.</P>
<P>Having drank tea together, Miss Emy pro∣posed
an evening walk, which they enjoyed
through a variety of little copses and lawns, wa∣tered
by a most romantic stream, that quite en∣chanted
the imagination of Peregrine.</P>
<P>It was late before they returned from this
agreeable excursion, and when our lover wished
the ladies good night, Mrs. Gauntlet insisted up∣on
his staying to supper, and treated him with
particular demonstrations of regard and affection.
As her oeconomy was not encumbered with an
unnecessary number of domestics, her own presence
was often required in different parts of the house,
so that the young gentleman was supplied with
frequent opportunities of promoting his suit, by
all the tender oaths and insinuations that his pas∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
could suggest. He protested, that her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
had taken such entire possession of his heart, that
finding himself unable to support her absence one
day longer, he had quitted his studies, and left
his governor by stealth, that he might visit the
object of his adoration, and be blessed in her
company for a few days without interruption.</P>
<P>She listened to his addresses with such affability
as denoted approbation and delight, and gently
chid him as a thoughtless truant, but carefully
avoided the confession of a mutual flame; be∣cause
she discerned, in the midst of all his ten∣derness,
a levity of pride which she durst not
venture to trust with such a declaration. Per∣haps
she was confirmed in this caution by her mo∣ther,
who very wisely, in her civilities to him,
maintained a sort of ceremonious distance, which
she thought not only requisite for the honour and
interest of her family, but likewise for her own
exculpation, should she ever be taxed with hav∣ing
encouraged or abetted him in the imprudent
faliies of his youth: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et notwithstanding this af∣fected
reserve, he was treated with such distinction
both by one and t'other, that he was ravished
with his situation, and became more and more
enamoured every day.</P>
<P>While he remained under the influence of this
sweet intoxication, his absence produced great
disturbance at Winchester. Mr. Jolter was g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie∣vously
afflicted at his abrupt departure, which
alarmed him the more, as it happened after a
long fit of melancholy which he had perceived in
his pupil. He communicated his apprehensions
to the master of the school, who advised him
to apprize the commodore of his nephe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s disap∣pearance,
and in the mean time inquire at all
the inns in town, whether he had hired horses,
<PB N="155" REF="163"/>
or any sort of carriage, for his conveyance, or
was not met with on the road by any person who
could give an account of the direction in which
he travelled.</P>
<P>This scrutiny, though performed with great di∣ligence
and minuteness, was altogether ineffectual;
they could obtain no intelligence of the runaway.
Mr. Trunnion was well nigh distracted at the
news of his flight; he raved with great fury at
the imprudence of Peregrine, whom in his first
transports he damned as an ungrateful deserter;
then he cursed Hatchway and Pipes, who he
swore had foundered the lad by their pernicious
counsels; and, lastly, transferred his execrations
upon Jolter, because he had not kept a better
look-out: finally, he made an apostrophe to that
son of a bitch the gout, which for the present
disabled him from searching for his nephew in
person. That he might not, however, neglect
any means in his power, he immediately dis∣patched
expresses to all the sea-port towns on that
coast, that he might be prevented from leaving
the kingdom; and the lieutenant, at his own de∣sire,
was sent across the country, in quest of this
young fugitive.</P>
<P>Four days had he unsuccessfully carried on his
inquiries with great accuracy, when resolving to
return by Winchester, where he hoped to meet
with some hints of intelligence, by which he
might profit in his future search, he struck off
the common road, to take the benefit of a nearer
cut; and finding himself benighted near a vil∣lage,
took up his lodging at the first inn to which
his horse directed him. Having bespoke some∣thing
for supper, and retired to his chamber,
where he amused himself with a pipe, he heard
<PB N="156" REF="164"/>
a confused noise of rustic jollity, which being all
of a sudden interrupted, after a short pause his
car was saluted by the voice of Pipes, who, at
the sollicitation of the company, began to enter∣tain
them with a song.</P>
<P>Hatchway instantly recognized the well-known
sound, in which indeed he could not possibly be
mistaken, as nothing in nature bore the least re∣semblance
to it; he threw his pipe into the
chimney, and snatching up one of his pistols, ran
immediately to the apartment from whence the
voice issued: he no sooner entered, than distin∣guishing
his old ship-mate in a crowd of country
peasants, he in a moment sprung upon him, and
clapping his pistol to his breast, exclaimed,
“Damn you, Pipes, you're a dead man, if you
don't immediately produce young master.”</P>
<P>This menacing application had a much greater
effect upon the company than upon Tom, who
looking at the lieutenant with great tranquillity,
replied, “Why so I can, Master Hatchway.”
“What! safe and sound?” cried the other.
“As a roach,” answered Pipes, so much to the
satisfaction of his friend Jack, that he shook him
by the hand, and desired him to proceed with
his song. This being performed, and the reck∣oning
discharged, the two friends adjourned to
the other room, where the lieutenant was in∣formed
of the manner in which the young gen∣tleman
had made his elopement from college, as
well as of the other particulars of his present si∣tuation,
as far as they had fallen within the sphere
of his comprehension.</P>
<P>While they sat thus conferring together, Pe∣regrine
having taken his leave of his mistress for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he night, came home, and was not a little sur∣prised,
<PB N="157" REF="165"/>
when Hatchway entering his chamber in
his sea attitude, thrust out his hand by way of
salutation. His old pupil received him as usual,
with great cordiality, and expressed his astonish∣ment
at meeting him in that place; but when
he understood the cause and intention of his arri∣val,
he started with concern; and his visage
glowing with indignation, told him he was old
enough to be judge of his own conduct, and
when he should see it convenient, would return
of himself; but those who thought he was to be
compelled to his duty, would find themselves
egregiously mistaken.</P>
<P>The lieutenant assured him, that for his own
part he had no intention to offer him the least
violence; but, at the same time, he represented
to him the danger of incensing the commodore,
who was already almost distracted on account of
his absence: and in short, conveyed his argu∣ment,
which were equally obvious and valid, in
such expressions of friendship and respect, that
Peregrine yielded to his remonstrances, and pro∣mised
to accompany him next day to Winchester.</P>
<P>Hatchway, overjoyed at the success of his nego∣ciation,
went immediately to the hostler and be∣spoke
a post-chaise for Mr. Pickle and his man, with
whom he afterwards indulged himself in a double
cann of rumbo, and when the night was pretty
far advanced, left the lover to his repose, or ra∣ther
to the thorns of his own mediation; for he
slept not one moment, being incessantly tortured
with the prospect of parting from his divine Emi∣lia,
who had now acquired the most absolute em∣pire
over his soul. One minute he proposed to
depart early in the morning, without seeing this
enchantress, in whose bewitching presence he
<PB N="158" REF="166"/>
durst not trust his own resolution. Then the
thoughts of leaving her in such an abrupt and
disrespectful manner, interposed in favour of his
love and honour. This war of sentiments kept
him all night upon the rack, and it was time to
rise before he had determined to visit his charmer,
and candidly impart the motives that induced him
to leave her.</P>
<P>He accordingly repaired to her mother's house
with a heavy heart, being attended to the gate
by Hatchway, who did not choose to leave him
alone; and being admitted, found Emilia just
risen, and in his opinion, more beautiful than
ever.</P>
<P>Alarmed at his early visit, and the gloom that
overspread his countenance, she stood in silent
expectation of hearing some melancholy tidings;
and it was not till after a considerable pause, that
he collected resolution enough to tell her he was
come to take his leave. Though she strove to
conceal her sorrow, nature was not to be sup∣pressed;
every feature of her countenance sad∣dened
in a moment, and it was not without the
utmost difficulty that she kept her lovely eyes
from overflowing. He saw the situation of her
thoughts, and in order to alleviate her concern,
assured her he should find means to see her again
in a very few weeks; mean while he communi∣cated
his reasons for departing, in which she rea∣dily
acquiesced; and having mutually consoled
each other, their transports of grief subsided, and
before Mrs. Gauntlet came down stairs they were
in a condition to behave with great decency and
resignation.</P>
<P>This good lady expressed her concern when
she learnt his resolution, saying, she hoped his
<PB N="159" REF="167"/>
occasions and inclinations would permit him to
favour them with his agreeable company another
time.</P>
<P>The lieutenant, who began to be uneasy at
Peregrine's stay, knocked at the door, and being
introduced by his friend, had the honour of
breakfasting with the ladies; on which occasion
his heart received such a rude shock from the
charms of Emilia, that he afterwards made a me∣rit
with his friend of having constrained himself
so far, as to forbear commencing his professed
rival.</P>
<P>At length they bad adieu to their kind enter∣tainers,
and in less than an hour setting out from
the inn, arrived about two o'clock in Winchester,
where Mr. Jolter was overwhelmed with joy at
their appearance.</P>
<P>The nature of this adventure being unknown
to all except those who could be depended upon,
every body who inquired about the cause of Pe∣regrine's
absence, was told that he had been with
a relation in the country, and the master conde∣scended
to overlook his indiscretion; so that
Hatchway seeing every thing settled to the satis∣faction
of his friend, returned to the garrison,
and gave the commodore an account of his expe∣dition.</P>
<P>The old gentleman was very much startled
when he heard there was a lady in the case, and
very emphatically observed, that a man had bet∣ter
be sucked into the gulph of Florida than once
get into the indraught of woman; because in one
case, he may with good pilotage bring out his ves∣sel
safe between the Bahama's and the Indian
shore; but in the other there is no outlet at all,
and it is in vain to strive against the current; so
<PB N="160" REF="168"/>
that of course he must be embayed, and run chuck
upon a lee-shore. He resolved, therefore, to lay
the state of the case before Mr. Gamaliel Pickle,
and concert such measures with him as should be
thought likeliest to detach his son from the pur∣suit
of an idle amour, which could not fail of in∣terfering
in a dangerous manner with the plan of
his education.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Perry's ideas were totally
engrossed by his amiable mistress, who, whether
he slept or waked, was still present in his imagi∣nation,
which produced the following stanza's in
her praise.</P>

This juvenile production was inclosed in a very
tender billet to Emilia, and committed to the
charge of Pipes, who was ordered to set out for
Mrs. Gauntlet's habitation with a present of ve∣nison,
and a compliment to the ladies; and di∣rected
to take some opportunity of delivering the
letter to miss, without the knowledge of her
mamma.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">His messenger meets with a misfortune, to which he
applies a very extraordinary expedient that is at∣tended
with strange consequences.</HEAD>
<P>AS a stage coach passed within two miles of
the village where she lived, Tom bar∣gained
with the driver for a seat on the box, and
accordingly departed on this message, though he
was but indifferently qualified for commissions of
such a nature: having received particular injunc∣tioins
about the letter, he resolved to make that
the chief object of his care, and very sagaciously
conveyed it between his stocking and the sole of
his foot, where he thought it would be perfectly
secure from all injury and accident. Here it re∣mained
until he arrived at the inn where he had
formerly lodged, when a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter having refreshed him∣self
with a draught of beer, he pulled off his stock∣ing,
and found the poor billet fullied with dust,
and torn into a thousand tatters by the motion of
his foot in walking the last two miles of his jour∣ney.
Thunderstruck at this phaenomenon, he
uttered a long and loud <HI>whew!</HI> which was suc∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded
by an exclamation of “Damn my old
shoes! a bite by G—!” then he rested his elbows
<PB N="162" REF="170"/>
on the table, and his forehead upon his two fists,
and in that attitude deliberated with himself upon
the means of remedying this misfortune.</P>
<P>As he was not distracted by a vast number of
ideas, he soon concluded that his best expedient
would be to employ the clerk of the parish, who
he knew was a great scholar, to write another
epistle according to the directions he should give
him; and never dreaming that the mangled ori∣ginal
would in the least facilitate this scheme, he
very wisely committed it to the flames, that it
might never rise up in judgment against him.</P>
<P>Having taken this wise step, he went in quest
of his scribe, to whom he communicated his bu∣siness,
and promised a full-pot by way of gratifi∣cation.
The clerk, who was also school-master,
proud of an opportunity to distinguish his talents,
readily undertook the task; and repairing with
his employer to the inn, in less than a quarter of
an hour produced a morsel of eloquence so much
to the satisfaction of Pipes, that he squeezed his
hand by way of acknowledgement, and doubled
his allowance of beer, which being discussed, our
courier betook himself to the house of Mrs. Gaunt∣let
with the haunch of venison and this succeda∣neous
letters, and delivered his message to the mo∣ther,
who received it with great respect, and
many kind inquiries about the health and welfare
of his master, attempting to tip the messenger
a crown, which he absolutely refused to accept,
in consequence of Mr. Pickle's repeated caution.
While the old gentlewoman turned to a servant,
in order to give directions about the disposal of
this present, Pipes looked upon this as a favour∣able
occasion to transact his business with Emilia,
and therefore, shutting one eye, with a jirk of his
<PB N="163" REF="171"/>
thumb towards his left shoulder, and a most sig∣nificant
twist of his countenance, he beckoned
the young lady into another room, as if he had
been fraught withsomething of consequences, which
he wanted to impart. She understood the hint
howsoever strangely communicated, and by step∣ing
to one side of the room, gave him an op∣portunity
of slipping the epistle into her hand,
which he gently squeezed at the same time in
token of regard; then throwing a side-glance at
the mother, whose back was turned, clapped his
finger to one side of his nose, thereby recom∣mending
secrecy and discretion.</P>
<P>Emilia conveying the letter into her bosom,
could not help smiling at Tom's politeness and
dexterity; but left her mamma should detect him
in the execution of his pantomime, she broke off
this intercourse of signs, by asking aloud when he
proposed to set out on his return to Winchester;
and when he answered “To-morrow morning,”
Mrs. Gauntlet recommended him to the hospita∣lity
of her own footman, desiring him to make
much of Mr. Pipes below, where he was kept to
supper, and very cordially entertained. Our
young heroine, impatient to read her lover's billet,
which made her heart throb with rapturous ex∣pectation,
retired to her chamber as soon as pos∣sible,
with a view of perusing the contents, which
were these.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Never was astonishment more perplexing than
that of Emilia, when she read this curious com∣position,
which she repeated verbatim three times
before she would credit the evidence of her own
senses. She began to fear in good earnest that
love had produced a disorder in her lover's under∣standing;
but after a thousand conjectures by
which she attempted to account for this extraor∣dinary
sustian of stile, she concluded that it was
the effect of mere levity, calculated to ridicule
the passion he had formerly professed. Irritated
by this supposition, she resolved to baulk his tri∣umph
with affected indifferences, and in the mean
time endeavour to expel him from that place
which he possessed within her heart. And indeed,
such a victory over her inclinations might have
been obtained without great difficulty; for she
enjoyed an easiness of temper that could accom∣modate
itself to the emergencies of her fate; and
her vivacity by amusing her imagination, pre∣served
<PB N="165" REF="173"/>
her from the keener sensations of sorrow.
Thus determined and disposed, she did not send
any sort of answer, or the least token of remem∣brance
by Pipes, who was suffered to depart with
a general compliment from the mother, and ar∣rived
at Winchester the next day.</P>
<P>Peregrine's eyes sparkled when he saw his mes∣senger
come in, and he stretched out his hand in
full confidence of receiving some particular mark
of his Emilia's affection; but how was he con∣founded,
when he felt his hope so cruelly disap∣pointed!
In an instant his countenance fell. He
stood for some time silent and abashed, then thrice
repeated the interrogation of “What! not one
word from Emilia?” And dubious of his courier's
discretion, inquired minutely into all the particu∣lars
of his reception. He asked if he had seen the
young lady, if she was in good health, if he had
found an opportunity of delivering his letter, and
how she looked when he put it into her hand?
Pipes answered, that he had never seen her in
better health or higher spirits; that he had ma∣naged
matters so as not only to present the billet
unperceived, but also to ask her commands in
private before he took his leave, when she told
him that the letter required no reply. This last
circumstance he considered as a mainfest mark of
disrespects, and gnawed his lips with resentment.
Upon further reflexion, however, he supposed
that she could not conveniently write by the mes∣senger,
and would undoubtedly favour him by
the post. This consideration consoled him for
the present, and he waited impatiently for the
fruits of his hope; but after he had seen eight
days elapsed without reaping the satisfaction with
which he had flattered himself, his temper forsook
<PB N="166" REF="174"/>
him, he raved against the whole sex, and was
seized with a fit of sullen chagrin; but his pride
in a little time came to his assistance, and rescued
him from the horrors of the melancholy fiend.
He resolved to retort her own neglect upon his
ungrateful mistress, his countenance gradually re∣sumed
its former serenity; and though by this
time he was pretty well cured of his foppery, he
appeared again at public diversions with an air of
gaiety and unconcern, that Emilia might have a
chance of hearing how much, in all likelihood, he
disregarded her disdain.</P>
<P>There are never wanting certain officious per∣sons,
who take pleasure in promoting intelligence
of this sort. His behaviour soon reached the ears
of Miss Gauntlet, and confirmed her in the opi∣nion
she had conceived from his letter; so that
she fortified herself in her former sentiments, and
bore his indifference with great philosophy. Thus
a correspondence which had commenced with all
the tenderness and sincerity of love, and every
promise of duration, was interrupted in its infancy
by a misunderstanding occasioned by the simpli∣city
of Pipes, who never once reflected upon the
consequences of his deceit.</P>
<P>Though their mutual passion was by these
means suppressed for the present, it was not alto∣gether
extinguished, but glowed in secret, though
even to themselves unknown, until an occasion
which afterwards offered, blew up the latent flame,
and love resumed his empire in their breasts.</P>
<P>While they moved, as it were, without the
sphere of each other's attraction, the commodore
fearing that Perry was in danger of involving
himself in some pernicious engagement, resolved
by advice of Mr. Jolter and his friend the parish
<PB N="167" REF="175"/>
priest, to recal him from the place where he had
contracted such imprudent connexions, and send
him to the university, where his education might
be compleated, and his fancy weaned from all
puerile amusements.</P>
<P>This plan had been proposed to his own fa∣ther,
who, as hath been already observed, stood
always neuter in every thing that concerned his
eldest son; and as for Mrs. Pickle, she had never
heard his name mentioned since his departure
with any degree of temper or tranquillity, except
when her husband informed her that he was in a
fair way of being ruined by this indiscreet amour.
It was then she began to applaud her own foresight,
which had discerned the mark of reprobation in
that vicious boy, and launched out in compari∣sons
between him and Gammy, who, she ob∣served,
was a child of uncommon parts and soli∣dity,
and with the blessing of God, would be a
comfort to his parents, and an ornament to the
family.</P>
<P>Should I affirm that this favourite whom she
commonded so much, was in every respect the
reverse of what she described; that he was a boy
of mean capacity, and though remarkably distorted
in his body, much more crooked in his disposi∣tion;
and that she had persuaded her husband to
espouse her opinion, though it was contrary to
common sense, as well as to his own perception;
I am afraid the reader will think I represent a
monster that never existed in nature, and be apt
to condemn the oeconomy of my invention; ne∣vertheless,
there is nothing more true than every
circumstance of what I have advanced; and I
wish the picture, singular as it is, may not be
thought to resemble more than one original.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is summoned to attend his uncle, is more
and more hated by his own mother; appeals to
his father, whose condescension is defeated by the
dominion of his wife.</HEAD>
<P>BUT waving these reflections, let us return
to Peregrine, who received a summons to
attend his uncle, and in a few days arrived with
Mr. Jolter and Pipes at the garrison, which he
filled with joy and satisfaction. The alteration,
which, during his absence, had happened in his
person, was very favourable to his appearance,
which from that of a comely boy, was converted
into that of a most engaging youth. He was al∣ready
taller than a middle-sized man, his shape
ascertained, his sinews well knit, his mien greatly
improved, and his whole figure as elegant and
graceful, as if it had been cast in the same mould
with the Apollo of Belvidere.</P>
<P>Such an outside could not fail of prepos∣sessing
people in his favour. The commedore,
notwithstanding the advantageous reports he had
heard, found his expectation exceeded in the per∣son
of Peregrine, and signified his approbation in
the most sanguine terms. Mrs. Trunnion was
struck with his genteel address, and received him
with uncommon marks of complacency and af∣fection;
he was caressed by all the people in the
neighbourhood, who, while they admired his ac∣complishments,
could not help pitying his infa∣tuated
mother, who was deprived of that unut∣terable
delight which any other parent would
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>
have enjoyed in the contemplation of such an
amiable son.</P>
<P>Divers efforts were made by some well-disposed
people, to conquer, if possible, this monstrous
prejudice; but their endeavours, instead of curing,
served only to inflame the distemper, and she ne∣ver
could be prevailed upon to indulge him in the
least mark of maternal regard. On the contrary,
her original disgust degenerated into such invete∣racy
of hatred, that she left no stone unturned to
alienate the commodore's affection for this her
innocent child, and even practised the most ma∣licious
defamation to accomplish her purpose.
Every day did she abuse her husband's ear with
some forged instance of Peregrine's ingratitude to
his uncle, well knowing that it would reach the
commodore's knowledge at night.</P>
<P>Accordingly Mr. Pickle used to tell him at the
club, that his hopeful favourite had ridiculed him
in such a company, and aspersed his spouse upon
another occasion; and thus retail the little scan∣dalous
issue of his own wife's invention. Luckily
for Peregrine, the commodore paid no great re∣gard
to the authority of his informer, because he
knew from what canal his intelligence flowed;
besides, the youth had a staunch friend in Mr.
Hatchway, who never failed to vindicate him
when he was thus unjustly accused, and always
found argument enough to confute the assertions
of his enemies. But, though Trunnion had been
dubious of the young gentleman's principles, and
deaf to the remonstrances of the lieutenant, Perry
was provided with a bulwark strong enough to
defend him from all such assaults. This was no
other than his aunt, whose regard for him was
perceived to increase in the same proportion as his
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
own mother's diminished; and indeed, the aug∣mentation
of the one was, in all probability, ow∣ing
to the decrease of the other; for the two la∣dies,
with great civility, performed all the duties
of good neighbourhood, and hated each other
most piously in their hearts.</P>
<P>Mrs. Pickle having been disobliged at the
splendor of her sister's new eq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipage, had ever
since that time, in the course of her visiting, en∣deavoured
to make people merry with satirical
jokes on that poor lady's infirmit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; and Mrs.
Trunnion seized the very first opportunity of
making reprisals, by inveighing against her unna∣tural
behaviour to her own child; so that Pere∣grine,
as on the one hand he was abhorred, so
on the other was he caressed in consequence of
this contention; and I firmly believe that the
most effectual method of destro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his interest at
the garrison, would have been the shew of coun∣tenancing
him at his father's house: but, whe∣ther
this conjecture be reasonable or chimerical,
certain it is the experiment was never tried, and
therefore Mr. Peregrine r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n no risk of being dis∣graced.
The commodore, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssumed, and justly
too, the whole merit of his education, was now
as proud of the youth's improvements, as if he
had actually been his own offspring; and some∣times
his affection rose to such a pitch of enthu∣siasm,
that he verily believed him to be the issue
of his own loins. Notwithstanding this favour∣able
predicament in which our hero stood with his
aunt and her husband, he could not help feeling
the injury he suffered from the caprice of his
mother; and though the gaiety of his disposition
hindered him from afflicting himself with reflexi∣ons
of any gloomy cast, he did not fail to forsee
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
that if any sudden accident should deprive him
of the commodore, he would in all likelihood
find himself in a very disagreeable situation.
Prompted by this consideration, he one evening
accompanied his uncle to the club, and was in∣troduced
to his father, before that worthy gentle∣man
had the least inkling of his arrival.</P>
<P>Mr. Gamaliel was never so disconcerted as at
this rencounter. His own disposition would not
suffer him to do any thing that might create the
least disturbance, or interrupt his evening's enjoy∣ment;
and so strongly was he impressed with the
terror of his wife, that he durst not yield to the
tranquillity of his temper: and, as I have already
observed, his inclination was perfectl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neutral.
Thus di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tracted between different motives, when
Perry was presented to him, he sat silent and ab∣sorpt,
as if he did not or would not perceive the
application; and when he was urged to declare
himself by the youth, who pathetically begged to
know how he had incurred his displeasure, he
answered in a peevish strain, “Why, good now,
child, what would you have me to do? your
mother can't abide you.” “If my mother is so
unkind, I will not call it unnatural, (said Pere∣grine,
the tears of indignation starting from his
eyes) as to banish me from her presence and af∣fection,
without the least cause assigned; I hope
you will not be so unjust as to espouse her barba∣rous
prejudice.” Before Mr. Pickle had time to
reply to this expostulation, for which he was not
at all prepared, the commodore interposed, and
enforced his favourite's remonstrance, by telling
Mr. Gamaliel that he was ashamed to see any
man <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rive in such a miserable manner under his
wife's petticoat.” As for my own part, (said he,
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
raising his voice, and assuming a look of impor∣tance
and command) before I would suffer myself
to be steered all weathers by any woman in Chris∣tendom,
d'ye see, I'd raise such a hurricane about
her ears that”—Here he was interrupted by
Mr. Hatchway, who thrusting his head towards
the door, in the attitude of one that listens, cried
“Ahey! there's your spouse come to pay us a
visit.” Trunnion's features that instant adopted
a new disposition: fear and confusion took pos∣session
of his countenance; his voice from a tone
of vociferation sunk into a whisper of “Sure you
must be mistaken, Jack;” and in great perplexity
he wiped off the sweat which had started on his
forehead at this false alarm. The lieutenant hav∣ing
thus punished him for the rhodomontade he
had uttered, told him with an arch sneer, that
he was deceived by the sound of the outward door
creaking upon its hinges, which he mistook for
Mrs. Trunnion's voice, and desired him to pro∣ceed
with his admonitions to Mr. Pickle. It is
not to be denied that this arrogance was a little
unseasonable in the commodore, who was in all
respects as effectually subdued to the dominion of
his wife, as the person whose submission he then
ventured to condemn; with this difference of dis∣position:
Trunnion's subjection was like that of
a bear, chequered with fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of surliness and rage;
whereas Pickle bore the yoke like an ox, without
repining. No wonder then that this indolence,
this sluggishness, this stagnation of temper, ren∣dered
Gamaliel incapable of withstanding the ar∣guments
and importunity of his friends, to which
he at length surrendered, acquiesced in the justice
of their observations, and taking his son by the
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
hand, promised to favour him for the future with
his love and fatherly protection.</P>
<P>But this laudable resolution did not last; Mrs.
Pickle still dubious of his constancy, and jealous
of his communication with the commodore, ne∣ver
failed to interrogate him every night about
the conversation that happened at the club; and
regulate her exhortations according to the intelli∣gence
she received. He was no sooner, therefore,
sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely conveyed to bed, (that academy in which
all notable wives communicate their lectures)
when her catechism began; and she in a moment
perceived someting reluctant and equivocal in
her husband's answers. Arroused at this discovery,
she employed her influence and skill with such
success, that he disclosed every circumstance of
what had happened; and after having sustained a
most severe rebuke for his simplicity and indiscre∣tion,
humbled himself so far as to promise
that he would next day annul the condescensions
he had made, and for ever renounce the ungra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous

was punctually performed in a letter to the com∣modore,
which she herself dictated in these words.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This letter, which nothing but his passion and
inexperience could excuse, had such an effect
upon his mother, as may be easily conceived. She
was enraged to a degree of frenzy against the
writer; though at the same time she considered
the whole as the production of Mrs. Trunnion's
particular pique, and represented it to her husband
as an insult, that he was bound in honour to re∣sent,
by breaking off all correspondence with the
commodore and his family. This was a bitter
pill to Gamaliel, who, through a long course of
years, was so habituated to Trunnion's company,
that he could as easily have parted with a limb,
as have relinquished the club all at once. He
therefore ventured to represent his own incapacity
to follow her advice, and begged that he might
at least be allowed to drop the connexion gradu∣ally;
<PB N="176" REF="184"/>
protesting that he would do his endeavour
to give her all manner of satisfaction.</P>
<P>Mean while preparations were made for Pere∣grine's
departure to the university, and in a few
weeks he set out in the seventeenth year of his
age, accompanied by the same attendants who
lived with him at Winchester, after his uncle
had laid strong injunctions upon him to avoid the
company of modest women, to mind to mind his learn∣ing,
to let him hear of his welfare as often as he
could spare time to write, and had settled his ap∣pointments
at the rate of five hundred a year, in∣cluding
his governor's salary, which was one fifth
part of the sum. The heart of our young gentlemen
dil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted at the prospect of the figure he should make
with such an handsome annui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, the management
of which was left to his own disc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etion; and he
amused his imagination with the most agreeable
reveries during his journey to Oxford, which he
performed in two days. Here being introd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced
to the head of the college, to whom he had been
recommended, accommodated with genteel apart∣ments,
entered as gentleman commoner in
the books, and provided with a judicious tutor,
instead of returning to the study of Greek and
Latin, in which he thought himself already suffi∣ciently
instructed; he renewed his acquaintance
with some of his old school-fellows, whom he
found in the same situation, and was by them ini∣tiated
in all the fashionable diversions of the place.</P>
<P>It was not long before he made himself remark∣able
for his spirit and humour, which were so
acceptable to the bucks of the university, that
he was admitted as a member of their corpora∣tion,
and in a very little time became the most
<PB N="177" REF="185"/>
conspicuous personage of the whole fraternity;
not that he valued himself upon his ability in
smoking the greatest number of pipes, and drink∣ing
the largest quantity of ale; these were quali∣fications
of too gross a nature to captivate his re∣fined
ambition. He p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qued himself on his talent
for raillery, his genius and taste, his personal ac∣complishments,
and his success at intrigue; nor
were his excursions confined to the small villages
in the neighbourhood, which are commonly vi∣sited
once a week by the students for the sake of
carnal recreation. He kept his own horses, tra∣versed
the whole country in parties of pleasure,
attended all the races within fifty miles of Oxford,
and made frequent jaunts to London, where he
used to lie incognito during the best part of many
a term.</P>
<P>The rules of the university were too se∣vere
to be observed by a youth of his vivacity;
and therefore he became acquainted with the
proctor, by times. But all the checks he re∣ceived
were insufficient to moderate his career;
he frequented taverns and coffee-houses, com∣mitted
midnight frolics in the streets, insulted all
the sober and pacific class of his fellow-students;
the tutors themselves were not sacred from his
ridicule; he laughed at the magistrate, and neg∣lected
every particular of college-discipline.</P>
<P>In vain did they attempt to restrain his irre∣gularities
by the imposition of fines; he was li∣beral
to profusion, and therefore paid without
reluctance. Thrice did he scale the windows of
a tradesman, with whose daughter he had an af∣fair
of gallantry, as often was he obliged to seek his
safety by a precipitate leap; and one night would,
in all probability, have fallen a sacrifice to an
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>
ambuscade that was laid by the father, had not
his trusty squire Pipes interposed in his behalf,
and manfully rescued him from the clubs of his
enemies.</P>
<P>In the midst of these excesses, Mr. Jolter find∣ing
his admonitions neglected, and his influence
utterly destroyed, attempted to wean his pupil
from his extravagant courses, by engaging his at∣tention
in some more laudable pursuit. With
this view he introduced him into a club of po∣liticians,
who received him with great demon∣strations
of regard, accommodated themselves
more than he could have expected to his jovial
disposition, and while they revolved schemes for
the reformation of the state, drank with such de∣votion
to the accomplishment of their plans, that
before parting the cares of their patriotism were
quite overwhelmed.</P>
<P>Peregrine, though he could not approve of
their doctrine, resolved to attach himself for some
time to their company; because he perceived
ample subject for his ridicule, in the characters o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these wrong-headed enthusiasts. It was a con∣stant
practice with them, in their midnight con∣sist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries,
to swallow such plentiful draughts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
inspiration, that their mysteries commonly ended
like those of the Bacchanalian Orgia; and they
were seldom capable of maintaining that solem∣nity
of decorum which by the nature of their
functions most of them were obliged to profess.
Now as Peregrine's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was never
more graitifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d than when he had an opportunity
of exposing grave characters in ridiculous atti∣tudes,
he laid a mischievous snare for his new
confederates, which took effect in this manner.
In one of their nocturnal deliberations, he pro∣moted
<PB N="179" REF="187"/>
such a spirit of good fellowship, by the
agreeable sallies of his wit, which were purposely
levelled against their political adversaries, that by
ten o'clock they were all ready to join in the
most extravagant proposal that could be made.
They had already broke their glasses in con∣sequence
of his suggestion, drank healths out of
their shoes, caps, and the bottoms of the candle∣sticks
that stood before them, sometimes standing
with one foot on a chair, and the knee bent on
the edge of the table; and when they could no
longer stand in that posture, setting their bare
posteriors on the cold floor, they huzza'd, hol∣lowed,
danced and sung, and in short were ele∣vated
to such a pitch of intoxication, that when
Peregrine proposed that they should burn their
perriwigs, the hint was immediately approved,
and they executed the frolick as one man; their
shoes and caps underwent the same sate by the
same instigation, and in this trim he led them
forth into the street, where they resolved to com∣pel
every body they should find to subscribe to
their political creed, and pronounce the Shibo∣leth
of their party. In the atchievement of this
enterprize, they met with more opposition than
they expected; they were encountered with ar∣guments
which they could not well withstand;
the noses of some, and eyes of others, in a very
little time bore the marks of obstinate disputa∣tion;
and their conductor having at length en∣gaged
the whole body in a fray with another
squadron which was pretty much in the same
condition, he very fairly gave them the slip, and
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly retreated to his apartment, foreseeing that
his companions would soon be favoured with the
notice of their superiors. Nor was he deceived
<PB N="180" REF="188"/>
in his prognostic; the proctor going his round,
chanced to fall in with this tumultuous uproar,
and interposing his authority, found means to
quiet the disturbance, and, after having taken
cognizance of their names, dismissed the rioters
to their respective chambers, not a little scanda∣lized
at the behaviour of some among them,
whose business and duty it was to set far other
examples to the youth under their care and di∣rection.</P>
<P>About midnight Pipes, who had orders to at∣tend
at a distance, and keep an eye upon Jolter,
brought home that unfortunate governor upon his
pack (Peregrine having beforehand secured his
admittance into the college) and among other
bruises, he was found to have received a couple
of contusions on his face, which next morning
appeared in a black circle that surrounded each
eye. This was a mortifying circumstance to a
man of his character and deportment, especially
as he had received a message from the proctor,
who desired to see him forthwith. With great
humility and contrition he begged the advice of
his pupil, who being used to amuse himself with
painting, assured Mr. Jolter, that he would co∣ver
those signs of disgrace with a slight coat of
flesh-colour, so dextrously, that it would be al∣most
impossible to distinguish the artificial from
the natural skin. The rueful governor, rather
than expose such opprobrious tokens to the ob∣servation
and censure of the magistrate, submitted
to the expedient; and although his counsellor
had over-rated his own skill, was persuaded to
confide in the disguise, and actually attended the
proctor, with such a staring addition to the na∣tural
ghastliness of his features, that his visage
<PB N="181" REF="189"/>
bore a very apt resemblance to some of those fe∣rocious
countenances that hang over the doors of
certain taverns and alehouses, under the denomi∣nation
of the Saracen's head.</P>
<P>Such a remarkable alteration of phisiognomy
could not escape the notice of the most un∣discerning
beholder, much less the penetrating
eye of this severe judge, already whetted with
what he had seen over-night. He was therefore
upbraided with his ridiculous and shallow artifice,
and, together with the companions of his de∣bauch,
underwent such a cutting reprimand for
the scandalous irregularity of his conduct, that
all of them remained crest-fallen, and were
ashamed, for many weeks, to appear in the pub∣lick
execution of their duty.</P>
<P>Peregrine was too vain of his finesse, to con∣ceal
the part he acted in this comedy, with the
particulars of which he regaled his companions,
and thereby intailed upon himself the hate and
resentment of the community, whose maxims
and practices he had disclosed; for he was con∣sidered
as a spy, who had intruded himself into
their society with a view of betraying it; or, at
best, an apostate and renegado from the faith
and principles which he had professed.</P>

<P>AMONG those who suffered by his craft
and infidelity was Mr. Jumble his own tu∣tor,
who could not at all digest the mortifying
affront he had received, and was resolved to be
revenged on the insulting author. With this

opportunity of treating him with disrespect, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch
he knew the disposition of his pupil could less

from chapel; and as Mr. Jumble never failed

his non-at<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endance, he invented some very plau∣sible
excuses; but, at length, his ingenuity was

<L>Necqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quam, patrias, tentasti lubricus, artes.</L>
<P>The imposition of this invidious theme had
all the desired effect upon Peregrine, who not
only considered it as a piece of unmannerly abuse
<PB N="183" REF="191"/>
levelled against his own conduct, but also as a
retrospective insult on the memory of his grand∣father,
who (as he had been informed) was in
his life-time more noted for his cunning than
candour in trade.</P>
<P>Exasperated at this instance of the pedant's
audacity, he had well nigh (in his first trans∣ports)
taken corporal satisfaction on the spot;
but foreseeing the troublesome consequences that
would attend such a flagrant outrage against the
laws of the university, he checked his indigna∣tion,
and resolved to revenge the injury in a
more cool and contemptuous manner. Thus
determined, he set on foot an inquiry into the
particulars of Jumble's parentage and education,
and learnt that the father of this insolent tutor
was a bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>klayer, and that his mother sold pies,
and that the son, at different periods of his youth,
had amused himself in both occupations, before
he conver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d his views to the study of learning.
Fraught with this intelligence, he composed the

</LG>
<P>This impudent production was the most effec∣tual
vengeance he could have taken on his tutor,
who had all the supercilious arrogance and ridi∣culous
pride of a low-born pedant. Instead of
overlooking this petulant piece of satire with that
temper and decency of disdain that became a per∣son
of his gravity and station, he no sooner cast
his eye over the performance, than the blood rushed
into his countenance, which immediately after
exhibited a ghastly pale colour, and with a qui∣vering
lip he told his pupil that he was an imper∣tinent
jackanapes, and he would take care that
he should be expelled from the university, for
having presumed to write and deliver such a licen∣tious
and scurrilous libel. Peregrine answered with
<PB N="185" REF="193"/>
great resolution, that when the provocation he
had received should be known, he was persuaded
that he should be acquitted by the opinion of all
impartial people; and that he was ready to sub∣mit
the whole to the decision of the master.</P>
<P>This arbitration he proposed, because he knew
the master and Jumble were at variance; and for
that reason the tutor durst not venture to put the
cause on such an issue. Nay, when this reference
was mentioned, Jumble, who was naturally jea∣lous,
suspected that Peregrine had a promise of
protection before he undertook to commit such
an outrageous insult; and this notion had such an
effect upon him, that he resolved to devour his
vexation, and wait for a more proper opportunity
of gratifying his hate. Mean while copies of the
ballad were distributed among the students, who
sung it under the very nose of Mr. Jumble, to the
tune of a <HI>Cobler there was, &amp;c.</HI> and the triumph
of our hero was compleat. Neither was his whole
time devoted to the riotous extravagancies of
youth. He enjoyed many lucid intervals, during
which he contracted a more intimate acquaintance
with the classicks, applied himself to the reading
of history, improved his taste for painting and
musick, in which he made some progress; and
above all things, cultivated the study of natural
philosophy. It was generally after a course of
close attention to some of these arts and sciences,
that his disposition broke out into those irregulari∣ties
and wild sallies of a luxuriant imagination,
for which he became so remarkable; and he was
perhaps the only young man in Oxford, who at
the same time maintained an intimate and friendly
intercourse with the most unthinking, as well as
with the most sedate students at the university.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="194"/>
It is not to be supposed that a young man of
Peregrine's vanity, inexperience and profusion,
could suit his expence to his allowance, liberal as
it was; for he was not one of those fortunate peo∣ple
who are born oeconomists, and knew not the
art of with-holding his purse when he saw his
companion in difficulty: thus naturally generous
and expensive, he squandered away his money, and
made a most splendid appearance upon the receipt
of his quarterly appointment; but long before the
third month was elapsed, his finances were con∣sumed,
and as he could not stoop to ask an extra∣ordinary
supply, was too proud to borrow, and
too haughty to run in debt with tradesmen, he
devoted those periods of poverty to the prosecu∣tion
of his studies, and shone forth again at the
revolution of quarter day.</P>
<P>In one of these irruptions he and some of his
companions went to Windsor, in order to see the
royal apartmen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the castle, whither they re∣paired
in the afternoon, and as Peregrine stood
contemplating the picture of Hercules and Om∣phale,
one of this fellow-students whispered in his
ear, “Z—ds! Pickle, there are two fine girls.”
He turned instantly about, and in one of them
recognize his almost forgotten Emilia: her ap∣pearance
acted upon his imagination like a spark of
fire that falls among gun-powder; that passion
which had lain dormant for the space of two years
flashed up in a moment, and he was seized with
an universal trepidation. She perceived and par∣took
of his emotion; for their souls, like unisons,
vibrated with the same impulse. However, she
called her pride and res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntment to her aid, and
found resolution enough to retire from such a dan∣gerous
scene. Alarmed at her retreat, he recol∣lected
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>
all his assurance, and impelled by love
which he could no longer resist, followed her into
the next room, where in the most disconcerted
manner he accosted her with “Your humble ser∣vant,
Miss, Gauntlet;” To which salutation she
replied, with an affectation of indifference that did
not, however, conceal her agitation, “Your ser∣vant,
Sir;” and immediately extending her finger
towards the picture of Duns Scotus, which is
fixed over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the doors, asked her companion
in a strange <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gling tone▪ if she did not
think he looked like a conjurer. Peregrine net∣tled
into spirits by this reception, answered for
the othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lady, “that it was an easy matter to be
a conjurer in those times, when the simplicity of
the age assisted his divination; but were he, or
Merlin himself to rise from the dead now, when
such deceit and dissimulation prevail, they would
no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be able to earn their bread by the profession.”
“—O! Sir, said she, (turning full upon him) with∣out
doubt they would adopt new maxims; 'tis
no disparagement in this enlightened age for one
to alter one's opinion.” “No sure, Madam, re∣plied
the youth with some precipitation, provided
the change be for the better;” “and should it
happen otherwise, retorted the nymph with a
flirt of her fan, inconstancy will never want
countenance from the practice of mankind.”
“True, Madam, resumed our hero, fixing his
eyes upon her, examples of levity are every where
to be met with.” “O Lord, Sir, cried Emilia,
tossing her head, you'll scarce ever find a fop
without it.” By this time his companion seeing
him engaged with one of the ladies, entered
into conversation with the other; and in order to
favour his friend's gallantry, conducted her into
<PB N="188" REF="196"/>
the next appartment, on pretence of entertaining
her with the sight of a remarkable piece of paint∣ing.</P>
<P>Peregrine laying hold on this opportunity of
being alone with the object of his love, assumed
a most seducing tenderness of look, and heaving
a profound sigh, asked if she had utterly discarded
him from her remembrance. Reddening at this
pathetic question, which recalled the memory of
the imagined slight he had put upon her, she an∣swered
in great confusion, “Sir, I believe I once
had the pleasure of seeing you at a ball in Win∣chester.”
“Miss Emilia, said he, very gravely,
will you be so candid as to tell me what misbeha∣viour
of mine you are pleased to punish, by re∣stricting
your remembrance to that single occa∣sion?”
“Mr. Pickle, she replied in the same
tone, it is neither my province nor inclination to
judge your conduct; and therefore your misapply
your question when you ask such an explanation
of me.” “At least, resumed our lover, give
me the melancholy satisfaction to know for what
offence of my committing you refused to take the
least notice of that letter which I had the honour
to write from Winchester by your own express
permission.” “Your letter, said Miss with great
vivacity, neither required, nor in my opinion,
deserved an answer; and to be free with you,
Mr. Pickle, it was but a shallow artifice to rid
yourself of a correspondence you had deigned to
sol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icit.” Peregrine confounded at this repartee,
replied that howsoever he might have failed in
point of elegance or discretion, he was sure he
had not been deficient in expressions of respect
and devotion for those charms which it was his
pride to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dore: “ As for the verses, said he, I
<PB N="189" REF="197"/>
own they were unworthy of the theme, but I
flattered myself that they would have merited your
acceptance, though not your approbation, and
been considered not so much as the proof of my
genius, as the genuine effusion of my love.”
“Verses? cried Emilia with an air of astonish∣ment,
what verses? I really don't understand
you.” The young gentleman was thunderstruck
at this exclamation, to which, after a long pause,
he answered, “I begin to suspect, and heartily
wish it may appear that we have misunderstood
each other from the beginning. Pray, Miss
Gauntlet, did not you find a copy of verses in∣closed
in that unfortunate letter?” “Truly, Sir,
(said the lady) I am not so much of a connoiseru
as to distinguish whether that facetious production
which you merrily stile an unfortunate letter was
composed in verse or prose; but, methinks, the
jest is a little too stale to be brought upon the car∣pet
again.” So saying, she tripped away to her
companion, and left her lover in a most tumultu∣ous
suspence. He now perceived that her neglect
of his addresses when he was at Winchester, must
have been owing to some mystery which he could
not comprehend; and she began to suspect and to
hope that the letter which she received was spu∣rious,
though she could not conceive how that
could possibly happen, as it had been delivered to
her by the hands of his own servant.</P>
<P>However, she resolved to leave the task of un∣ravelling
the affair, to him who, she knew,
would infallibly exert himself for his own as well
as her satisfaction. She was not deceived in her
opinion; he went up to her again at the stair∣case,
and as they were unprovided with a male
attendant, insisted upon squiring the ladies to their
<PB N="190" REF="198"/>
lodgings. Emilia saw his drift, which was no
other than to know where she lived; and though
she approved of his finesse, thought it was incum∣bent
upon her for the support of her own dignity
to decline his civility: she therefore thanked him
for his polite offer, but would by no means con∣sent
to his giving himself such unnecessary trouble,
especially as they had a very little way to walk.
He was not repulsed by this refusal, the nature of
which he perfectly understood; nor was she sorry
to see him persevere in his determination; he
therefore accompanied them in their return, and
made divers efforts to speak with Emilia in parti∣cular:
but she had a spice of the coquette in her
disposition, and being determined to whet his im∣patience,
artfully baffled all his endeavours, by
keeping her companion continually engaged in the
conversation, which turned upon the venerable
appearance and imperial situation of the place.
Thus tantalized, he lounged with them to the
door of the house in which they lodged, when his
mistress perceiving by the countenance of her
comrade, that she was on the point of desiring
him to walk in, checked her intention with a
frown, then turning to Mr. Pickle, dropped him
a very formal curt'sey, seized the other young
lady by the arm, and saying “Come, cousin So∣phy,”
vanished in a moment.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">After sundry unsuccessful efforts, he finds means to
come to an explanation with his mistress; and a
rec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nciliation ensues.</HEAD>
<P>PEregrine, disconcerted at their sudden dis∣appearance,
stood for some minutes gap∣ing
in the street, before he could get the better
of his surprize; and then deliberated with himself
whether he should demand immediate admittance
to his mistress, or choose some other method of
application. Piqued at her abrupt behaviour,
though pleased with her spirit, he set his inven∣tion
to work, in order to contrive some means of
seeing her; and in a fit of musing arrived at the
inn, where he found his companions whom he
had left at the Castle-gate. They had already
made inquiry about the ladies, in consequence of
which, he learnt that Miss Sophy w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s daughter
of a gentleman in town to whom his mistress
was related; that an intimate friendship subsisted
between the two young ladies; that Emilia had
lived about a month with her cousin, and appeared
at the last assembly, where she was universally
admired; and that several young gentlemen of
fortune had since that time teized her with ad∣dresses.</P>
<P>Our hero's ambition was flattered, and his
passion inflamed with this intelligence; and he
swore within himself that he would not quit the
spot until he should have obtained an indisputed
victory over all his rivals.</P>
<P>That same evening he composed a most elo∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt
epistle, in which he earnestly intreated that
<PB N="192" REF="200"/>
she would favour him with an opportunity of vin∣dicating
his conduct; but she would neither re∣ceive
his billet nor see his messenger. Baulked in
this effort, he inclosed it in a new cover directed
by another hand, and ordered Pipes to ride next
morning to London, on purpose to deliver it at
the post-office; that coming by such conveyance,
she might have no suspicion of the author, and
open it before she should be aware of the deceit.</P>
<P>Three days he waited patiently for the effect
of this stratagem, and in the afternoon of the
fourth, ventured to hazard a formal visit, in qua∣lity
of an old acquaintance. But here too he
failed in his attempt; she was indisposed and could
not see company. These obstacles served only
to increase his eagerness; he still adhered to his
former resolution; and his companions under∣standing
his determination, left him next day to
his own inventions. Thus relinquished to his
own ideas, he doubled his assiduity, and practised
every method his imagination could suggest, in
order to promote his plan.</P>
<P>Pipes was stationed all day long within sight of
her door, that he might be able to give his master
an account of her motions; but she never went
abroad except to visit in the neighbourhood, and
was always housed before Peregrine could be ap∣prized
of her appearance. He went to church
with a view of attracting her notice, and humbled
his deportment before her; but she was so mis∣chievously
devout as to look at nothing but her
book, so that he was not favoured with one
glance of regard. He frequented the coffee-house,
and attempted to contract an acquaintance
with Miss Sophy's father, who, he hoped, would
invite him to his house; but this expectation was
<PB N="193" REF="201"/>
also defeated. That prudent gentleman looked
upon him as one of those forward fortune-hunters
who go about the country seeking whom they
may devour, and warily discouraged all his ad∣vances.
Chagrined by so many unsuccessful en∣deavours,
he began to despair of accomplishing
his aim, and as the last suggestion of his art, paid
off his lodging, took horse at noon, and departed,
in all appearance, for the place from whence he
had come. He rode, however, but a few miles,
and in the dusk of the evening returned unseen,
alighted at another inn, ordered Pipes to stay
within doors, and keeping himself incognito, em∣ployed
another person as a centinel upon Emilia.</P>
<P>It was not long before he reaped the fruits of
his ingenuity. Next day in the afternoon he was
informed by his spy, that the two young ladies
were gone to walk in the park, whither he fol∣lowed
them on the instant, fully determined to
come to an explanation with his mistress, even
in presence of her friend, who might possibly be
prevailed upon to interest herself in his behalf.</P>
<P>When he saw them at such a distance that they
could not return to town before he should have
an opportunity of putting his resolution in prac∣tice,
he mended his pace, and found means to ap∣pear
before them so suddenly, that Emilia could
not help expressing her surprize in a scream. Our
lover putting on a mein of humility and mortifi∣cation,
begged to know if her resentment was
implacable; and asked why she had so cruelly re∣fused
to grant him the common privilege that
every criminal enjoyed. “Dear Miss Sophy,
said he, addressing himself to her companion, give
me leave to implore your intercession with your
cousin; I am sure you have humanity enough to
<PB N="194" REF="202"/>
espouse my cause, did you but know the justice of
it; and I flatter myself, that by your kind inter∣position,
I may be able to rectify that fatal misun∣derstanding
which hath made me wretched.”
“Sir, said Sophy, you appear like a gentleman,
and I doubt not but your behaviour has been al∣ways
suitable to your appearance; but you must
excuse me from undertaking any such office in
behalf of a person whom I have not the honour
to know.” “Madam, answered Peregrine, I
hope Miss Emy will justify my pretensions to that
character, notwithstanding the mystery of her
displeasure, which upon my honour I cannot for
my soul explain.” “Lord! Mr. Pickle, said
Emilia, (who had by this time recollected herself)
I never questioned your gallantry and taste, but I
am resolved that you shall never have cause to
exercise your talents at my expence; so that you
teize yourself and me to no purpose: come, So∣phy,
let us walk home again.” “Good God!
Madam, (cried the lover with great emotion)
why will you distract me with such barbarous in∣difference?
Stay, dear Emilia! I conjure you on
my knees to stay and hear me: by all that is sacred!
I was not to blame, you must have been
imposed upon by some villain who envied my good
fortune, and took some treacherous method to
ruin my love.”</P>
<P>Miss Sophy, who possessed a large stock of
good nature, and to whom her cousin had com∣municated
the cause of her reserve, seeing the
young gentleman so much affected with that dis∣dain
which she knew to be feigned, laid hold on
Emilia's sleeve, saying with a smile, “Not quite
so fast, Emily; I begin to perceive that this is a
love-quarrel, and therefore there may be hopes
<PB N="195" REF="203"/>
of a reconciliation; for I suppose both parties are
open to conviction.” “For my own part, (cried
Peregrine with great eagerness) I appeal to Miss
Sophy's decision. But why do I say appeal? Tho'
I am conscious of having committed no offence,
I am ready to submit to any penance, let it be
never so rigorous, that my fair enslaver herself
shall impose, provided it will intitle me to her
favour and forgiveness at last.” Emily well nigh
overcome by this declaration, told him that as
she taxed him with no guilt, she expected no at∣tonement;
and pressed her companion to return
into town. But Sophy, who was too indulgent
to her friend's real inclination to comply with her
request, observed that the gentleman seemed so
reasonable in his concessions, she began to think
her cousin was in the wrong, and felt herself dis∣posed
to act as umpire in the dispute.</P>
<P>Overjoyed at this condescension, Mr. Pickle
thanked her in the most rapturous terms, and in
the transport of his expectation, kissed the hand
of his kind mediatrix; a circumstance which had
a remarkable effect on the countenance of Emi∣lia,
who did not seem to relish the warmth of his
acknowledgement.</P>
<P>After many supplications on one hand, and
pressing remonstrances on the other, she yielded
at length, and turning to her lover, while her
face was overspread with blushes, “Well, Sir,
(said she) supposing I were to put the difference
on that issue, how could you excuse the ridiculous
letter which you sent to me from Winchester.”
This expostulation introduced a discussion of the
whole affair, in which all the circumstances were
canvassed; and Emilia still affirmed with great
heat, that the letter must have been calculated to
<PB N="196" REF="204"/>
affront her; for she could not suppose the author
was so weak as to design it for any other purpose.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who still retained in his memory
the substance of this unlucky epistle, as well as
the verses which were inclosed, could recollect
no particular expression which could have justly
given the least umbrage; and therefore in the
agonies of perplexity, begged that the whole
might be submitted to the judgment of Miss So∣phy;
and faithfully promised to stand to her award.</P>
<P>In short, this proposal was with seeming re∣luctance
embraced by Emilia, and an appointment
made to meet next day in the same place, whi∣ther
both parties were desired to come provided
with their credentials, according to which defini∣tive
sentence would be pronounced.</P>
<P>Our lover having succeeded thus far, over∣whelmed
Sophy with acknowledgements on account
of her generous mediation, and in the course of
their walk, which Emilia was now in no hurry
to conclude, whispered a great many tender pro∣testations
in the ear of his mistress, who, never∣theless,
continued to act upon the reserve, until
her doubts should be more fully resolved.</P>
<P>Mr. Pickle having found means to amuse them
in the fields till the twilight, was obliged to wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
them good even, after having obtained a solemn
repetition of their promise to meet him at the
appointed time and place; and then retreated to
his apartment, where he spent the whole night in
various conjectures on the subject of this letter,
the gordian knot of which he could by no means
untie.</P>
<P>One while he imagined that some wag had
played a trick upon his messenger, in consequence
of which Emilia had received a supposititious letter;
<PB N="197" REF="205"/>
but upon further reflection, he could not conceive
the practicability of any such deceit. Then he
began to doubt the sincerity of his mistress who,
perhaps, had only made that an handle for dis∣carding
him, at the request of some favoured rival;
but his own integrity forbad him to harbour this
mean suspicion; and therefore he was again in∣volved
in the labyrinth of perplexity. Next day
he waited on the rack of impatience for the hour
of five in the afternoon, which no sooner struck,
than he ordered Pipes to attend him, in case there
should be occasion for his evidence; and repaired
to the place of rendezvous, where he had not
tarried five minutes before the ladies appeared.
Mutual compliments being passed, and the at∣tendant
stationed at a convenient distance, Pere∣grine
persuaded them to sit down upon the grass,
under the shade of a spreading oak, that they
might be more at their ease; while he stretched
himself at their feet, and desired that the paper
on which his doom depended might be examined.
It was accordingly put into the hand of his fair
arbitress, who read it immediately with an audi∣ble
voice. The first two words of it were no
sooner pronounced, than he started with great
emotion, and raised himself upon his hand and
knee, in which posture he listened to the rest of
the sentence; and then sprung upon his feet in
the utmost astonishment, and glowing with re∣sentment
at the same time, exclaimed “Hell and
the devil! what's all that? Sure you make a jest
of me, madam.” “Pray, Sir, (said Sophy) give
me the hearing for a few moments, and then urge
what you shall think proper in your own defence.”
H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving thus cautioned him, she proceeded; but
before she had finished one half of the performance,
<PB N="198" REF="206"/>
her gravity forsook her, and she was seized with
a violent fit of laughter, in which neither of the
lovers could help joining, notwithstanding the
resentment which at that instant prevailed in the
breasts of both. The judge, however, in a little
time, resumed her solemnity, and having read
the remaining part of this curious epistle, all three
continued staring at each other alternately for the
space of half a minute, and then broke forth at
the same instant in another paroxism of mirth.
From this unanimous convulsion, one would have
thought that both parties were extremely well
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the joke; yet this was by no means
the case.</P>
<P>Emilia imagined that notwithstanding his af∣fected
surprize, her lover in spite of himself had
renewed the laugh at her expence, and in so do∣ing,
applauded his own unmannerly ridicule. This
supposition could not not fail of raising and reviv∣ing
her indignation, while Peregrine highly re∣sented
the indignity with which he supposed him∣self
treated, in their attempting to make him the
dupe of such a gross and ludicrous artifice. This
being the situation of their thoughts, their mirth
was succeeded by a mutual gloominess of aspect,
and the judge addressing herself to Mr. Pickle,
asked if he had any thing to offer why sentence
should not be pronounced. “Madam, answered
the culprit, I am sorry to find myself so low in
the opinion of your cousin, as to be thought ca∣pable
of being deceived by such a shallow con∣trivance.”
“Nay, Sir, said Emily, the contri∣vance
is your own, and I cannot help admiring
your confidence in imputing it to me.” “Upon
my honour, Miss Emily, resumed our hero, you
wrong my understanding as well as my love, in
<PB N="199" REF="207"/>
accusing me of having written such a silly imper∣tinent
performance: the very appearance and ad∣dress
of it is so unlike the letter which I did my∣self
the honour to write, that I dare say my man,
even at this distance of time, will remember the
difference.” So saying, he extended his voice,
and beckoned to Pipes, who immediately drew
near. His mistress seemed to object to the evi∣dence,
by observing that to be sure Mr. Pipes
had his cue; when Peregrine begging she would
spare him the mortification of considering him in
such a dishonourable light, desired his valet to
examine the outside of the letter, and recollect
if it was the same which he had delivered to Miss
Gauntlet about two years ago. Pipes having
taken a superficial view of it, pulled up his
breeches, saying, “Mayh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p it is, but we have
made so many trips, and been in so many creeks
and corners since that time, that I can't pretend
to be certain; for I neither keep journal nor log∣book
of our proceedings.” Emilia commended
him for his candour, at the same darting a sarcast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c
look at his master, as if she thought he had tam∣pered
with his servant's integrity in vain; and Pe∣regrine
began to rave and curse his fate for hav∣ing
subjected him to such mean suspicion, attest∣ing
heaven and earth in the most earnest manner,
that far from having composed and conveyed that
stupid production, he had never seen it before,
nor been privy to the least circumstance of the
plan.</P>
<P>Pipes, now for the first time, perceived the
mischief which he had occasioned, and moved
with the transports of his master, for whom he
had a most inviolable attachment, frankly de∣clared
he was ready to make oath that Mr. Pickle
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>
had no hand in the letter which he delivered.
All three were amazed at this confession, the
meaning of which they could not comprehend;
aud Peregrine after some pause, leaped upon Pipes,
and seizing him by the throat, exclaimed in an
extasy of rage, “Rascal! tell me this instant
what became of the letter I intrusted to your
care.” The patient valet, half strangled as he
was, squirted a collection of tobacco juice out of
one corner of his mouth, and with great delibe∣ration
replied, “Why burnt it, you wouldn't
have me give the young woman a thing that
shook all in the wind in tatters, would you?”
The ladies interposed in behalf of the distressed
squire, from whom, by dint of questions which
he had neither art nor inclination to evade, they
extorted an explanation of the whole affair.</P>
<P>Such ridiculous simplicity and innocence of in∣tention
appeared in the composition of his expe∣dient,
that even the remembrance of all the cha∣grin
which it had produced, could not rouse their
indignation, or enable them to resist a third erup∣tion
of laughter which they forthwith underwent.</P>
<P>Pipes was dismissed with many menacing in∣junctions,
to beware of such conduct for the fu∣ture;
Emilia stood with a confusion of joy and
tenderness in her countenance; Peregrine's eyes
kindled into rapture, and when Miss Sophy pro∣nounced
the sentence of reconciliation, advanced
to his mistress, saying, “Truth is mighty, and
will prevail;” then clasping her in his arms, very
impudently ravished a kiss, which she had not
power to refuse. Nay, such was the impulse of
his joy, that he took the same freedom with the
lips of Sophy, calling her his kind mediatrix and
guardian angel, and behaved with such extrava∣gance
<PB N="201" REF="209"/>
of transport, as plainly evinced the fervour
and sincerity of his love.</P>
<P>I shall not pretend to repeat the tender protes∣tations
that were uttered on one side, or describe
the bewitching glances of approbation with which
they were received on the other; suffice it to
say, that the endearing intimacy of their former
connexion was instantly renewed, and Sophy,
who congratulated them upon the happy termi∣nation
of their quarrel, favoured with their mu∣tual
confidence. In consequence of this happy
pacification, they deliberated upon the means of
seeing each other often; and as he could not
without some previous introduction visit her
openly at the house of her relation, they agreed
to meet every afternoon in the park till the next
assembly, at which he would solicit her as a part∣ner,
and she be unengaged, in expectation of
his request. By this connexion he would be in∣titled
to visit her next day, and thus an avowed
correspondence would of course commence. This
plan was actually put in execution, and attended
with a circumstance which had well nigh pro∣duced
some mischievous consequence, had not Pe∣regrine's
good fortune been superior to his discre∣tion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="27" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He atchieves an adventure at the assembly, and
quarrels with his governor.</HEAD>
<P>AT the assembly, were no fewer than three
gentlemen of fortune, who rivalled our
lover in his passion for Emilia, and who had se∣verally
begged the honour of dancing with her
<PB N="202" REF="210"/>
upon that occasion. She had excused herself to
each, on pretence of a slight indisposition that she
foresaw would detain her from the ball, and de∣sired
they would provide themselves with other
partners. Obliged to admit her excuse, they ac∣cordingly
followed her advice; and after they
had engaged themselves beyond the power of re∣tracting,
had the mortification to see her there
unclaimed.</P>
<P>They in their turns made up to her, and ex∣pressed
their surprize and concern at finding her
in the assembly unprovided, after she had declined
their invitation; but she told them that her cold
had forsaken her since she had the pleasure of see∣ing
them, and that she would rely upon accident
for a partner. Just as she pronounced these words
to the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the three, Peregrine advanced as an
utter stranger, bowed with great respect, told her
he understood she was disengaged, and would
think himself highly honoured in being accepted
as her partner for the night; and had the good
fortune to succeed in his application.</P>
<P>As they were by far the handsomest and best
accomplished couple in the room, they could not
fail of attracting the notice and admiration of the
spectators, which inflamed the jealousy of his
three competitors, who immediately entered into
a conspiracy against this gaudy stranger, whom
as their rival, they resolved to affront in publick.
Pursuant to the plan which they projected for this
purpose, the first country-dance was no sooner
concluded, than one of them with his partner
took place of Peregrine and his mistress, contrary
to the regulations of the ball. Our lover imput∣ing
this behaviour to inadvertency, informed the
gentleman of his mistake, and civilly desired he
<PB N="203" REF="211"/>
would rectify his error. The other told him, in
an imperious tone, that he wanted none of his
advice, and bad him mind his own affairs. Pe∣regrine
answered with some warmth, and insisted
upon his right; a dispute commenced, high words
ensued, in the course of which, our impetuous
youth hearing himself reviled with the appellation
of scoundrel, pulled off his antagonist's periwig,
and flung it in his face. The ladies immediately
shriek'd, the gentlemen interposed, Emilia was
seized with a fit of trembling, and conducted to
her seat by her youthful admirer, who begged
pardon for having discomposed her, and vindi∣cated
what he had done, by representing the ne∣cessity
he was under to resent the provocation he
had received.</P>
<P>Though she could not help owning the justice
of his plea, she was not the less concerned at the
dangerous situation in which he had involved
himself, and in the utmost consternation and
anxiety, insisted upon going directly home: he
could not resist her importunities, and her cousin
being determined to accompany her, he escorted
them to their lodgings, where he wished them
good night, after having, in order to quiet their
apprehensions, protested that if his opponent was
satisfied, he should never take any step towards
the prosecution of the quarrel. Mean while the
assembly-room became a scene of tumult and up∣roar;
the person who conceived himself injured,
seeing Peregrine retire, struggled with his com∣panions
who with-held him, in order to pursue and
take satisfaction of our hero, whom he loaded
with terms of abuse, and challenged to single
combat.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="212"/>
The director of the ball held a consultation
with all the subscribers who were present, and it
was determined by a majority of votes, that the
two gentlemen who had occasioned the disturb∣ance,
should be desired to withdraw. This reso∣lution
being signified to one of the parties then
present, he made some difficulty of complying,
but was persuaded to submit by his two confede∣rates,
who accompanied him to the street-door,
where he was met by Peregrine on his return to
the assembly.</P>
<P>This choleric gentleman, who was a country
squire, no sooner saw his rival, than he began to
brandish his cudgel in a menacing posture, when
our adventurous youth stepping back with one foot,
laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword, which he
drew half way out of the scabbard. This attitude,
and the sight of the blade which glittened by
mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght in his face, checked in some sort, the
ardour of his assailant, who desired he would lay
aside his toaster, and take a bout with him at
equal arms. Peregrine, who was an expert
cudgel-player, accepted the invitation, and ex∣changing
weapons with Pipes who stood behind
him, put himself in a posture of defence, and
received the attack of his adversary, who struck
at random without either skill or oeconomy. Pic∣kle
could have beaten the cudgel out of his hand
at the first blow, but as in that case he would
have been obliged in honour to give imme∣diate
quarter, he resolved to discipline his anta∣gonist
without endeavouring to disable him until
he should be heartily satisfied with the vengeance
he had taken. With this view he returned the
salute, and raised such a clatter about the squire's
pate, that one who had heard without seeing the
<PB N="205" REF="213"/>
application, would have mistaken the sound for
that of a salt-box, in the hand of a dext'rous
Merry Andrew, belonging to one of the booths at
Bartholomew Fair. Neither was this salutation
confined to his head; his shoulders, arms, thighs,
ancles and ribs, were visited with amazing rapi∣dity,
while Tom Pipes sounded the charge through
his fist. Peregrine tired-with this exercise, which
had almost bereft his enemy of sensation, at last
struck the decisive blow, in consequence of which,
the squire's weapon flew out of his grasp, and he
allowed our hero to be the better man. Satisfied
with this acknowledgment, the victor walked up
stairs with such elevation of spirits and insolence
of mein, that no body chose to intimate the re∣solution
which had been taken in his absence, and
having amused himself for some time in beholding
the country dances, he retreated to his lodging,
where he indulged himself all night in the con∣templation
of his own success.</P>
<P>Next day in the forenoon he went to visit his
partner, and the gentleman at whose house she
lived, having been informed of his family and
condition, received him with great courtesy, as
the acquaintance of his cousin Gauntlet, and in∣vited
him to dinner that same day.</P>
<P>Emilia was remarkably well pleased, when she
understood the issue of his adventure, which be∣gan
to make some noise in town, even though it
deprived her of a wealthy admirer; for the squire
having consulted an attorney about the nature of
the dispute, in hopes of being able to prosecute
Peregrine for an assault, and finding little encou∣ragement
to go to law, resolved to pocket the
insult and injury he had undergone, and to dis∣continue
<PB N="206" REF="214"/>
his addresses to her who was the cause
of both.</P>
<P>Our lover being told by his mistress that she
porposed to stay a fortnight longer at Windsor,
determined to enjoy her company all that time,
and then to give her a convoy to the house of her
mother, whom he longed to see. In consequence
of this plan, he every day contrived some fresh
party of pleasure for the ladies, to whom he had
by this time free access; and intangled himself so
much in the snares of love, that he seemed quite
enchanted by Emilia's charms, which were now
indeed almost irresistible. While he thus heed∣lessly
roved in the flowery paths of pleasure, his
governor at Oxford alarmed at the unusual dura∣tion
of his absence, went to the young gentlemen
who had accompanied him in his excursion, and
very earnestly intreated them to tell him what
they knew concerning his pupil; they accordingly
gave him an account of the rencounter that hap∣pened
between Peregrine and Miss Emily Gaunt∣let
in the castle, and mentioned circumstances
sufficient to convince him that his charge was very
dangerously engaged.</P>
<P>Far from having an authority over Peregrine,
Mr. Jolter durst not even disoblige him, and
therefore, instead of writing to the commodore,
he took horse immediately, and that same night
reached Windsor, where he found his stray sheep
very much surprised at his unexpected arrival.</P>
<P>The governor desiring to have some serious
conversation with him, they shut themselves up
in an apartment, when Jolter with great solem∣nity,
communicated the cause of his journey,
which was no other than his concern for his pu∣pil's
welfare; and very gravely undertook to
<PB N="207" REF="215"/>
prove by mathematical demonstration, that this
intrigue, if further pursued, would tend to the
young gentleman's ruin and disgrace. This sin∣gular
proposition to raised the curiosity of Peregrine,
who promised to yield all manner of attention,
and desired him to begin without further pream∣ble.</P>
<P>The governor, encouraged by this appearance
of candour, expressed his satisfaction in finding
him so open to conviction, and told him he
would proceed upon geometrical principles. Then
hemming thrice, observed, that no mathematical
inquiries could be carried on, except upon certain
<HI>data,</HI> or concessions to truths, that were self-evident;
and therefore he must crave his assent
to a few axioms, which he was sure Mr. Pickle
would see no reason to dispute. “In the first
place then (said he) you will grant, I hope, that
youth and discretion are with respect to each
other as two parallel lines, which though infi∣nitely
produced, remain still equi-distant, and
will never coincide: then you must allow that
passion acts upon the human mind, in a ratio
compounded of the acuteness of sense, and con∣stitutional
heat: and thirdly, you will not deny
that the angle of remorse is equal to that of pre∣cipitation.
These <HI>postulata</HI> being admitted,
(added he, taking paper, pen and ink, and draw∣ing
a parallelogram) let youth be represented by
the right line <HI>a, b,</HI> and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retion by another right
line <HI>c, d,</HI> parallel to the former. Compleat the
par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llelogram <HI>a, b, c, d,</HI> and let the point of in∣tersection,
<HI>b,</HI> represent perdition. Let passion,
represented under the letter <HI>c,</HI> have a motion in
the direction <HI>c, a.</HI> At the same time, let another
motion be communicated to it, in the direction
<PB N="208" REF="216"/>
<HI>c, d,</HI> it will proceed in the diagonal <HI>c, b,</HI> and
describe it in the same time that it would have
described the side <HI>c, a,</HI> by the first motion, or
the side <HI>c, d,</HI> by the second. To understand
the demonstration of this corollary, we must
premise this obvious principle, that when a body
is acted upon by a motion or power parallel to a
right line given in position, this power, or mo∣tion,
has no effect to cause the body to approach
towards that line, or recede from it, but to
move in a line parallel to a right line only; as
appears from the second law of motion: there∣fore
<HI>c, a,</HI> being parallel to <HI>d, b,</HI>”—</P>
<P>His pupil having listened to him thus far,
could contain himself no longer, but interrupted
the investigation with a loud laugh, and told him
that his <HI>postulata</HI> put him in mind of a certain
learned and ingenious gentleman, who under∣took
to disprove the existence of natural evil,
and asked no other <HI>datum</HI> on which to found his
demonstration, but an acknowledgment that <HI>every
thing that is, is right.</HI> “You may therefore
(said he, in a peremptory tone) spare yourself
the trouble of torturing your invention; for,
after all, I am pretty certain that I shall want
capacity to comprehend the discussion of your
lemma, and consequently be obliged to refuse
my assent to your deduction.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was disconcerted at this declaration,
and so much offended at Peregrine's disrespect,
that he could not help expressing his displeasure,
by telling him flatly, that he was too violent and
headstrong to be reclaimed by reason and gentle
means; that he (the tutor) must be obliged in
the discharge of his duty and conscience, to in∣form
the commodore of his nephew's imprudence;
<PB N="209" REF="217"/>
that if the laws of this realm were effectual, they
would take cognizance of the gipsy who had led
him astray; and observed, by way of contrast,
that if such a preposterous intrigue had happened
in France, she would have been clapt up in a convent
two years ago.</P>
<P>Our lover's eyes kindled with indignation,
when he heard his mistress treated with such ir∣reverence;
he could scarce refrain from inflict∣ing
manual chastisement on the blasphemer,
whom he reproached in his wrath as an arrogant
pedant, without either delicacy or sense, and cau∣tioned
him against using any such impertinent
freedoms with his affairs for the future, on pain
of incurring more severe effects of his resent∣ment.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who entertained very high no∣tions
of that veneration to which he thought
himself intitled by his character and qualifica∣tions,
had not bore without repining, his want of
influence and authority over his pupil, against
whom he cherished a particular grudge, ever
since the adventure of the painted eye; and
therefore, on this occasion, his political forbear∣ance
had been overcome by the accumulated mo∣tives
of his disgust. Indeed he would have re∣signed
his charge with disdain, had not he been
encouraged to persevere, by the hopes of a good
living which Trunnion had in his gift, or known
how to dispose of himself for the present to better
advantage.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He receives a letter from his aunt, breaks with the
commodore, and disobliges the lieutenant, who,
nevertheless, undertakes his cause.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while he quitted the youth in
high dudgeon, and that same evening
dispatched a letter for Mrs. Trunnion, which
was dictated by the first transports of his passion,
and of course replete with severe animadversions
on the misconduct of his pupil.</P>
<P>In consequence of this complaint, it was not
long before Peregrine received an epistle from
his aunt, wherein she commemorated all the cir∣cumstances
of the commodore's benevolence to∣wards
him, when he was helpless and forlorn,
deserted and abandoned by his own parents, up∣braided
him for his misbehaviour and neglect of
his tutor's advice, and insisted upon his breaking
off all intercourse with that girl who had seduced
his youth, as he valued the continuance of her
affection and her husband's regard.</P>
<P>As our lover's own ideas of generosity were
extremely refined, he was shocked at the inde∣licate
insinuations of Mrs. Trunnion, and felt
all the pangs of an ingenuous mind, that labours
under obligations to a person whom it contemns;
far from obeying her injunction, or humbling
himself by a submissive answer to her reprehen∣sion,
his resentment buoyed him up above every
selfish consideration; he resolved to attach him∣self
to Emilia, if possible, more than ever; and
although he was tempted to punish the officious∣ness
of Jolter, by recriminating upon his life and
<PB N="211" REF="219"/>
conversation, he generously withstood the im∣pulse
of his passion, because he knew that his
governor had no other dependance than the good
opinion of the commodore. He could not,
however, digest in silence the severe expostula∣tions
of his aunt; to which he replied by the
following letter, addressed to her husband.</P>
<LETTER>

Conscious of this integrity of heart, I cannot
but severely feel your lady's unkind (I will not
call it ungenerous) recapitulation of the favours
I have received; and as I take it for granted,
that you knew and approved of her letter, I must
beg leave to assure you, that far from being
swayed by menaces and reproach, I am deter∣mined

<P>The commodore, who did not understand
those nice distinctions of behaviour, and dreaded
the consequence of Peregrine's amour, against
<PB N="212" REF="220"/>
which he was strangely prepossessed, was ex∣asperated
at the insolence and obstinacy of this
adopted son; to whose epistle he wrote the fol∣lowing
answer, which was transmitted by the
hands of Hatchway, who had orders to bring the
delinquent along with him to the garison.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Peregrine was equally piqued and disconcerted
at the receit of this letter, which was quite dif∣ferent
from what he had expected, and declared
in a resolute tone to the lieutenant, who brought
it, that he might return as soon as he pleased;
for he was determined to consult his own incli∣nation,
and remain for some time longer where
he was.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="221"/>
Hatchway endeavoured to persuade him by all
the arguments which his sagacity and friendship
could supply, to shew a little more deference for
the desire of the old man, who was by this time
rendered fretful and peevish by the gout, which
now hindered him from enjoying himself as usual,
and who might, in his passion, take some step
very much to the detriment of the young gen∣tleman,
whom he had hitherto considered as his
own son. Among other remonstrances, Jack
observed that mayhap Peregrine had got under
Emilia's hatches, and did not choose to set her
adrift; and if that was the case, he himself would
take charge of the vessel, and see her cargo safely
delivered; for he had a respect for the young
woman, and his needle pointed towards matri∣mony;
and as, in all probability, she could not
be much the worse for the wear, he would make
shift to scud thro' life with her under an easy
sail.</P>
<P>Our lover was deaf to all his admonitions,
and having thanked him for this last instance of
his complaisance, repeated his resolution of ad∣hering
to his first purpose. Hatchway having
profited so little by mild exhortations, assumed a
more peremptory aspect, and plainly told him he
neither could nor would go home without him;
so he had best make immediate preparation for
the voyage.</P>
<P>Peregrine made no other reply to this decla∣ration
than by a contemptuous smile, and rose
from his seat in order to retire; upon which the
lieutenant started up, and posting himself by
the door, protested with some menacing gestures,
that he would not suffer him to run a-head nei∣ther.
The other, incensed at his presumption
<PB N="214" REF="222"/>
in attempting to detain him by force, tripped up
his wooden leg, and laid him on his back in a
moment; then walked deliberately towards the
park, in order to indulge his reflection, which at
that time teemed with disagreeable thoughts. He
had not proceeded two hundred steps, when he
heard something blowing and stamping behind him;
and looking back, perceived the lieutenant at his
heels, with rage and indignation in his coun∣tenance.
This exasperated seaman, impatient of
the affront he had received, and forgetting all
the circumstances of their former intimacy, ad∣vanced
with great eagerness to his old friend,
saying, “Look ye, brother, you're a saucy boy,
and if you was at sea, I would have your arse
brought to the David for your disobedience; but
as we are on shore, you and I must crack a pistol
at one another; here is a brace, you shall take
which you please.”</P>
<P>Peregrine, upon recollection, was sorry for
having been laid under the necessity of disobliging
honest Jack, and very frankly asked his pardon
for what he had done. But this condescension
was misinterpreted by the other, who refused any
other satisfaction but that which an officer ought
to claim; and, with some irreverent expressions,
asked if Perry was afraid of his bacon. The
youth, inflamed at this unjust insinuation, darted
a ferocious look at the challenger, told him he
had paid but too much regard to his infirmities,
and bad him walk forward to the park, where
he would soon convince him of his error, if he
thought his concession proceeded from fear.</P>
<P>About this time, they were overtaken by
Pipes, who having heard the lieutenant's fall,
and seen him pocket his pistols, suspected that
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>
there was a quarrel in the case, and followed
him with a view of protecting his master. Pere∣grine
seeing him arrive, and guessing his inten∣tion,
assumed an air of serenity, and pretending
that he had left his handkerchief at the inn, or∣dered
his man to go thither and fetch it to him
in the park, where he would find them at his re∣turn.
This command was twice repeated be∣fore
Tom would take any other notice of the
message, except by shaking his head: but being
urged with many threats and curses to obedience,
he gave them to understand that he knew their
drift too well to trust them by themselves. “As
for you, lieutenant Hatchway (said he) I have
been your ship-mate, and know you to be a sai∣lor,
that's enough; and as for master, I know
him to be as good a man as ever stept betwixt
stem and stern, whereby, if you have any thing
to say to him, I am your man, as the saying is.
Here's my sapling, and I don't value your crackers
of a rope's end.” This oration, the longest that
ever Pipes was known to make, he concluded
with a flourish of his cudgel, and enforced with
such determined refusals to leave them, that
they found it impossible to bring the cause to
mortal arbitrement at that time, and strolled
about the park in profound silence; during
which, Hatchway's indignation subsiding, he all
of a sudden thrust out his hand as an advance to
reconciliation, which being cordially shaken by
Peregrine, a general pacification ensued; and
was followed by a consultation about the means
of extricating the youth from his present per∣plexity.
Had his disposition been like that of
most other young men, it would have been no
difficult task to overcome his difficulties; but
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>
such was the obstinacy of his pride, that he
deemed himself bound in honour to resent the
letters he had received; and, instead of sub∣mitting
to the pleasure of the commodore, ex∣pected
an acknowledgment from him, without
which he would listen to no terms of accommo∣dation.
“Had I been his own son (said he) I
should have bore his reproof, and sued for for∣giveness;
but knowing myself to be on the
footing of an orphan who depends entirely upon
his benevolence, I am jealous of every thing
that can be construed into disrespect, and insist
upon being treated with the most punctual re∣gard.
I shall now make application to my fa∣ther,
who is obliged to provide for me by the
ties of nature, as well as the laws of the land;
and if he shall refuse to do me justice, I can
never want employment while men are required
for his majesty's service.”</P>
<P>The lieutenant, alarmed at this intimation,
begged he would take no new step, until he
should hear from him; and that very evening
set out for the garison, where he gave Trunnion
an account of the miscarriage of his negotiation,
told him how highly Peregrine was offended at
the letter, communicated the young gentleman's
sentiments and resolution; and finally assured
him, that unless he should think proper to ask
pardon for the offence he had committed, he
would, in all appearance, never more behold
the face of his godson.</P>
<P>The old commodore was utterly confounded
at this piece of intelligence; he had expected
all the humility of obedience and contrition from
the young man; and instead of that, received
nothing but the most indignant opposition, and
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>
even found himself in the predicament of an of∣fender,
obliged to make atonement, or forfeit
all correspondence with his favourite. These
insolent conditions at first threw him into an
agony of wrath, and he vented execrations with
such rapidity, that he left himself no time to
breathe, and had almost been suffocated with his
choler. He inveighed bitterly against the ingra∣titude
of Peregrine, whom he mentioned with
many opprobrious epithets, and swore that he
ought to be keel-hauled for his presumption;
but when he began to reflect more coolly upon
the spirit of the young gentleman, which had al∣ready
manifested itself on many occasions, and
listened to the suggestions of Hatchway, whom
he had always considered as an oracle in his
way, his resentment abated, and he determined
to take Perry into favour again; this plac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bility
being not a little facilitated by Jack's narrative
of our hero's intrepid behaviour at the assembly,
as well as in the contest with him in the park.
But still this plaguy amour occurred like a bug∣bear
to his imagination; for he held it as an in∣fallible
maxim, that woman was an eternal source
of misery to man. Indeed this apothegm he sel∣dom
repeated since his marriage, except in the
company of a very few intimates, to whose se∣crecy
and discretion he could trust. Finding
Jack himself at a nonplus in the affair of Emilia,
he consulted Mrs. Trunnion, who was equally
surprised and offended, when she understood that
her letter did not produce the desired effect; and
after having imputed the youth's obstinacy to his
uncle's unseasonable indulgence, had recourse to
the advice of the parson, who, stil with an eye
to his friend's advantage, counselled them to send
<PB N="218" REF="226"/>
the young gentleman on his travels, in the course
of which he would, in all probability, forget the
amusements of his greener years. The proposal
was judicious, and immediately approved, when
Trunnion going into his closet, after divers ef∣forts,
produced the following billet, with which
Jack departed for Windsor that same afternoon.</P>

house.</HEAD>
<P>PEregrine, fortified as he was with pride and
indignation, did not fail to feel the smart∣ing
suggestions of his present situation: after
having lived so long in an affluent and imperious
manner, he could ill brook the thoughts of sub∣mitting
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>
to the mortifying exigencies of life;
all the gaudy schemes of pomp and pleasure,
which his luxuriant imagination had formed, be∣gan
to dissolve; a train of melancholy ideas took
possession of his thoughts, and the prospect of
losing Emilia was not the least part of his afflic∣tion.
Though he endeavoured to suppress the
chagrin that preyed upon his heart, he could not
conceal the disturbance of his mind from the
penetration of that amiable young lady, who
sympathized with him in her heart, though she
could not give her tongue the liberty of asking
the cause of his disorder; for, notwithstanding
all the ardour of his addresses, he never could
obtain from her the declaration of a mutual
flame; because, tho' he had hitherto treated her
with the utmost reverence of respect, he had ne∣ver
once mentioned the final aim of his passion;
and however honourable she supposed it to be,
she had discernment enough to foresee, that va∣nity
or interest co-operating with the levity of
youth, might one day deprive her of her lover,
and she was too proud to give him any handle of
exulting at her expence; so that, although he was
received by her with the most distinguished civility,
and even an intimacy of friendship, all his solli∣citations
could never extort from her an acknow∣ledgment
of love; on the contrary, being of a
gay disposition, she sometimes coquetted with
other admirers, that his attention thus whetted
might never abate, and that he might see she
had other resources, in case he should flagg in
his affection.</P>
<P>This being the prudential plan on which she
acted, it cannot be supposed that she would con∣descend
to inquire into the state of his thoughts,
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>
when she saw him thus affected; but she, ne∣vertheless,
imposed that task on her cousin and
confidan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who, as they walked together in the
park, observed that he seemed to be out of hu∣mour.
When this is the case, such a question
generally increases the disease; at least it had
that effect upon Peregrine, who replied somewhat
peevishly, “I assure you, Madam, you never
was more mistaken in your observations.” “I
think so too (said Emilia) for I never saw Mr.
Pickle in higher spirits.” This ironical enco∣mium
completed his confusion; he affected to
smile, but it was a smile of anguish, and in his
heart cursed the vivacity of both. He could not
for his soul recollect himself, so as to utter one
connected sentence; and the suspicion that they
observed every circumstance of his behaviour,
threw such a damp on his spirits, that he was
quite overwhelmed with shame and resentment,
when Sophy casting her eyes towards the gate,
said, “Yonder is your servant, Mr. Pickle, with
another man who seems to have a wooden leg.”
Peregrine started at this intelligence, and imme∣diately
underwent sundry changes of complexion,
knowing that his fate, in a great measure, de∣pended
upon the information he would receive
from his friend.</P>
<P>Hatchway advancing to the company, after a
brace of sea-bows to the ladies, took the youth
aside, and put the commodore's letter into his
hand, which threw him into such an agitation,
that he could scarce pronounce, “Ladies, will
you give me leave?” And when, in conse∣quence
of their permission, he attempted to open
the billet, he fumbled with such manifest disorder,
that his mistress, who watched his motions, be∣gan
<PB N="221" REF="229"/>
to think there was something very interesting
in the message; and so much was she affected
with his concern, that she was fain to turn her
head another way, and wipe the tears from her
lovely eyes.</P>
<P>Mean while, Peregrine no sooner read the first
sentence, than his countenance, which before was
overcast with a deep gloom, began to be lighted
up, and every feature unbending by degrees, he
recovered his serenity; and having perused the
letter, his eyes sparkling with joy and gratitude,
he hugged the lieutenant in his arms, and pre∣sented
him to the ladies as one of his best friends.
Jack met with a most gracious reception, and
shook Emilia by the hand, telling her, with the
familiar appellation of <HI>old acquaintance,</HI> that he
did not care how soon he was master of such an∣other
clean-going frigate as herself.</P>
<P>The whole company partook of this favour∣able
change that evidently appeared in our lover's
recollection, and enlivened his conversation with
such an uncommon flow of sprightliness and good
humour, as even made an impression on the iron
countenance of Pipes himself, who actually
smiled with satisfaction as he walked behind
them.</P>
<P>The evening being pretty far advanced, they
directed their course homeward; and while the
valet attended Hatchway to the inn, Peregrine
escorted the ladies to their lodgings, where he
owned the justness of Sophy's remark, in saying
he was out of humour, and told them he had
been extremely chagrined at a difference which
happened between him and his uncle, to whom
(by the letter which they had seen him receive)
he now found himself happily reconciled.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230"/>
Having received their congratulations, and de∣clined
staying to sup with them, on account of
the longing desire he had to converse with his
friend Jack, he took his leave, and repaired to
the inn, where Hatchway informed him of every
thing that had happened in the garison upon his
representations; and far from being disgusted, he
was perfectly well pleased with the prospect of
going abroad, which flattered his vanity and am∣bition,
gratified his thirst after knowledge, and
indulged that turn for observation, for which he
had been remarkable from his most tender years:
neither did he believe a short absence would tend
to the prejudice of his love, but, on the contrary,
inhance the value of his heart, because he should
return better accomplished, and consequently a
more welcome offering to his mistress. Elevated
with these sentiments, his heart dilated with joy,
and the sluices of his natural benevolence being
opened by this happy turn of his affairs, he sent
his compliments to Mr. Jolter, to whom he had
not spoken during a whole week, and desired
he would favour Mr. Hatchway and him with his
company at supper.</P>
<P>The governor was not weak enough to decline
this invitation, in consequence of which he forth∣with
appeared, and was cordially welcomed by
the relenting pupil, who expressed his sorrow for
the misunderstanding which had prevailed be∣tween
them, and assured him, that for the future
he would avoid giving him any just cause of
complaint. Jolter, who did not want affections,
was melted by this acknowledgment, which he
could not have expected, and earnestly protested,
that his chief study had always been, and ever
<PB N="223" REF="231"/>
should be, to promote Mr. Pickle's interest and
happiness.</P>
<P>The best part of the night being spent in the
circulation of a chearful glass, the company broke
up; and next morning Peregrine went out, with
a view of making his mistress acquainted with
his uncle's intention of sending him out of the
kingdom for his improvement, and of saying every
thing which he thought necessary for the interest
of his love. He found her at breakfast with
her cousin; and as he was very full of the subject
of his visit, had scarce fixed himself in his seat,
when he brought it upon the carpet, by asking
with a smile, if the ladies had any commands for
Paris? Emilia at this question began to stare,
and her confidante desired to know who was
going thither? He no sooner gave them to un∣derstand,
that he himself intended in a short
time to visit that capital, than his mistress, with
great precipitation, wished him a good journey,
and affected to talk with indifference about the
pleasures he would enjoy in France: but when
he seriously assured Sophy, who asked if he was
in earnest, that his uncle actually insisted upon
his making a short tour, than the tears gushed in
poor Emilia's eyes, and she was at great pains to
conceal her concern, by observing that the tea
was so scalding hot, as to make her eyes water.
This pretext was too thin to impose upon her
lover, or even deceive the observation of her
friend Sophy, who after breakfast took an oppor∣tunity
of quitting the room.</P>
<P>Thus left by themselves, Peregrine imparted
to her what he had learnt of the commodore's
intention, without, however, mentioning a syl∣lable
of his being offended at their correspon∣dence;
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>
and accompanied his information with
such servent vows of eternal constancy, and so∣lemn
promises of a speedy return, that Emily's
heart, which had been invaded by a suspicion,
that this scheme of travelling was the effect of
her lover's inconstancy, began to be more at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase; and she could not help signifying her ap∣probation
of his design.</P>
<P>This affair being amicably compromised, he
asked how soon she proposed to set out for her
mother's house; and understanding that her de∣parture
was fixed for next day but one, and
that her cousin Sophy intended to accompany
her in her father's chariot, he repeated his in∣tention
of attending her, and in the mean time
dismissed his governor and the lieutenant to the
garison, with his compliments to his aunt and
the commodore, and a faithful promise of his
being with them in six days at farthest.</P>
<P>These previous measures being taken, he, at∣tended
by Pipes, set out with the ladies; and
they had also a convoy for twelve miles from
Sophy's father, who, at parting, recommended
them piously to the care of Peregrine, with
whom, by this time, he was perfectly well ac∣quainted.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">They meet with a dreadful alarm on the road, ar∣rive
at their journey's end. Peregrine is intro∣duced
to Emily's brother; these two young gen∣tlemen
misunderstand each other. Pickle departs
for the garison.</HEAD>
<P>AS they travelled at an easy rate, they had
performed something more than one half
of their journey, when they were benighted near
an inn, at which they resolved to lodge; the ac∣commodation
was very good, they s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pped toge∣ther
with great mirth and enjoyment, and it was
not till after he had been warned by the yawns of
the ladies, that he conducted them to their apart∣ment;
and wishing them good night, retired to
his own, and went to rest.</P>
<P>The house was crowded with country poeple
who had been at a neighbouring fair, and now
regaled themselves with ale and tobacco in the
yard; so that their consideration, which at any
time was but slender, being now overwhelmed by
this debauch, they staggered in to their respec∣tive
kennels, and left a lighted candle flicking to
one of the wooden pillars that supported the
gallery. The flame in a little time laid hold on
the wood, which was as d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y as tinder, and the
whole gallery was on fire, when Peregrine sud∣denly
waked, and found himself almost suffo∣cated.
He sprung up in an instant, slipped on
his breeches, and throwing open the door of his
chamber, saw the whole entry in a blaze.</P>
<P>Heavens! what were the emotions of his soul,
when he beheld the volumes of flame and smoke
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>
rolling towards the room where his dear Emilia
lay! Regardless of his own danger, he darted
himself through the thickest of the gloom, when
knocking hard, and calling at the same time to
the ladies, with the most anxious intreaty to be
admitted; the door was opened by Emilia in her
shift, who asked with the utmost trepidation,
what was the matter? He made no reply, but
snatching her up in his arms, like another Aeneas,
bore her through the flames to a place of safety;
where leaving her, before she could recollect her∣self,
or pronounce one word, but “Alas! my
cousin Sophy!” he flew back to the rescue of
that young lady, and found her already delivered
by Pipes, who having been alarmed by the smell
of fire, had got up, rushed immediately to the
chamber where he knew these companions lodg∣ed,
and (Emily being saved by her lover) brought
off Miss Sophy, with the loss of his own shock-head
of hair, which was singed off in his re∣treat.</P>
<P>By this time the whole inn was alarmed,
every lodger, as well as servant, exerted him∣self,
in order to stop the progress of this cala∣mity;
and there being a well replenished horse-pond
in the yard, in less than an hour the fire
was totally extinguished, without having done
any other damage than that of consuming about
two yards of the wooden gallery.</P>
<P>All this time our young gentleman closely at∣tended
his fair charge, each of whom had swoon∣ed
with apprehension; but as their constitutions
were good, and their spirits not easily dissipated,
when upon reflection they found themselves and
their company safe, and that the flames were
happily quenched, the tumult of their fears sub∣sided,
<PB N="227" REF="235"/>
they put on their cloaths, recovered their
good humour, and began to rally each other on
the trim in which they had been secured. Sophy
observed, that now Mr. Pickle had an indisputable
claim to her cousin's affection; and therefore she
ought to lay aside all affected reserve for the fu∣ture,
and frankly avow the sentiments of her
heart. Emily retorted the argument, putting
her in mind, that by the same claim Mr. Pipes
was intitled to the like return from her. Her
friend admitted the force of the conclusion, pro∣vided
she could not find means of satisfying her
deliverer in another shape; and turning to the
valet, who happened to be present, asked if his
heart was not otherwise engaged? Tom, who
did not conceive the meaning of the question,
stood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lent according to custom; and the inter∣rogation
being repeated, answered with a grin,
“Heart-whole as a biscuit, I'll assure you, Mi∣stress.”
“What! (said Emilia) have you never
been in love, Thomas?”. “Yes, forsooth, (re∣plied
the valet, without hesitation) sometimes of
a morning.” Peregrine could not help laughing,
and his mistress looked a little disconcerted at
this blunt repartee; while Sophy, slipping a purse
into his hand, told him there was something to
purchase a periwig. Tom having consulted his
master's eyes, refused the present, saying, “No,
thank ye as much as if I did.” And though she
insisted upon his putting it in his pocket, as a
small testimony of her gratitude, he could not
be prevailed upon to avail himself of her gene∣rosity;
but following her to the other end of the
room, thrust it into her sleeve without ceremony,
exclaiming, “I'll be damned to hell if I do.”
Peregrine having checked him for his boorish
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
behaviour, sent him out of the room, and begged
that Miss Sophy would not endeavour to debauch
the morals of his servant, who rough and un∣cultivated
as he was, had sense enough to per∣ceive
that he had no pretension to any such ac∣knowledgment.
But she argued with great ve∣hemence,
that she should never be able to make
an acknowledgment adequate to the service he
had done her, and that she should never be per∣fectly
easy in her own mind, until she found
some opportunity of manifesting the sense she had
of the obligation: “I do not pretend (said she)
to reward Mr. Pipes; but I shall be absolutely
unhappy, unless I am allowed to give him some
token of my regard.”</P>
<P>Peregrine thus earnestly sollicited, desired that
since she was bent upon displaying her generosity,
she would not bestow upon him any pecuniary
gratification, but honour him with some trinket,
as a mark of consideration; because he himself
had such a particular value for the fellow, on ac∣count
of his attachment and fidelity, that he
should be sorry to see him treated on the footing
of a common mercenary domestick.</P>
<P>There was not one jewel in the possession of
this grateful young lady, that she would not have
gladly given as a recompence, or badge of di∣stinction,
to her rescuer: but his master pitched
upon a seal ring of no great value that hung at
her watch; and Pipes being called in, had per∣mission
to accept that testimony of Miss Sophy's
favour. Tom received it accordingly with sun∣dry
scrapes, and having kissed it with great devo∣tion,
put it on his little finger, and strutted off,
extremely proud of his acquisition.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="237"/>
Emilia, with a most enchanting sweetness of
aspect, told her lover, that he had instructed her
how to behave towards him; and taking a dia∣mond
ring from her finger, desired he would
wear it for her sake. He received the pledge as
became him, and presented another in exchange,
which she at first refused, alledging that it would
destroy the intent of her acknowledgment; but
Peregrine assured her, he had accepted her jewel,
not as a proof of her gratitude, but as the mark
of her love; and that if she refused a mutual
token, he should look upon himself as the object
of her disdain. Her eyes kindled, and her cheeks
glowed with resentment at this impudent intima∣tion,
which she considered as an unseasonable in∣sult;
and the young gentleman perceiving her
emotion, stood corrected for his temerity, and
asked pardon for the liberty of his remonstrance,
which he hoped she would ascribe to the preva∣lence
of that principle alone, which he had al∣ways
taken pride in avowing.</P>
<P>Sophy seeing him disconcerted, interposed in
his behalf, and chid her cousin for having prac∣tised
such unnecessary affectation; upon which
Emilia, softened into compliance, held out her
finger as a signal of her condescension. Pere∣grine
put on the ring with great eagerness,
mumbled her soft white hand in an extasy, which
would not allow him to confine his embraces to
that limb, but urged him to seize her by the
waist, and snatch a delicious kiss from her love-pouting
lips; nor would he leave her a butt to
the ridicule of Sophy, on whose mouth he in∣stantly
committed a rape of the same nature; so
that the two friends, countenanced by each
other, reprehended him with such gentleness of
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
rebuke, that he was almost tempted to repeat the
offence.</P>
<P>The morning being now lighted up, and the
servants of the inn on foot, he ordered some cho∣colate
for breakfast, and at the desire of the la∣dies
sent Pipes to see the horses fed, and the cha∣riot
prepared, while he went to the bar, and dis∣charged
the bill.</P>
<P>These measures being taken, they set out
about five o'clock, and having refreshed them∣selves
and their cattle at another inn on the road,
during the heat of the day, they proceeded in
the afternoon; and, without meeting with any
other accident, safely arrived at the place of
their destination, where Mrs. Gauntlet expressed
her joy at seeing her old friend Mr. Pickle, whom,
however, she kindly reproached for the long dis∣continuance
of his regard. Without explaining
the cause of that interruption, he protested that
his love and esteem had never been discontinued,
and that for the future he should omit no occasion
of testifying how much he had her friendship at
heart. She then made him acquainted with her
son, who at that time was in the house, being
excused from his duty by furlow.</P>
<P>This young man, whose name was godfrey,
was about the age of twenty, of a middling size,
vigorous make, remarkably well shaped, and the
scars of the small pox, of which he bore a good
number, added a peculiar manliness to the air of
his count nance. His capacity was good, and
his disposition naturally frank and easy; but he
had been a soldier from his infancy, and his edu∣cation
was altogether in the military stile. He
looked upon taste and letters as meer pedantry,
beneath the consideration of a gentleman, and
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>
every civil station of life as mean, when com∣pared
with the profession of arms. He had made
great progress in the gymnastic sciences of dan∣cing,
fencing and riding, played perfectly well
on the German flute, and above all things va∣lued
himself upon a scrupulous observance of all
the points of honour.</P>
<P>Had Peregrine and he considered themselves
upon equal footing, in all probability they would
have immediately entered into a league of inti∣macy
and friendship; but this sufficient soldier
looked upon his sister's admirer as a young stu∣dent
raw from the university, and utterly igno∣rant
of mankind, while squire Pickle beheld
Godfrey in the light of a needy volunteer,
greatly inferior to himself in fortune, as well as
every other accomplishment. This mutual mis∣understanding
could not fail of producing ani∣mosities.
The very next day after Peregrine's ar∣rival,
some sharp repartees passed between them
in presence of the ladies, before whom each en∣deavoured
to assert his own superiority. In these
contests our hero never failed of obtaining the
victory, because his genius was more acute, and
his talents better cultivated than those of his an∣tagonist,
who therefore took umbrage at his suc∣cess,
became jealous of his reputation, and be∣gan
to treat him with marks of scorn and dis∣respect.</P>
<P>His sister saw, and dreading the consequence
of his ferocity, not only took him to task in
private for his impolite behaviour, but also in∣treated
her lover to make allowances for the
roughness of her brother's education. He kindly
assured her, that whatever pains it might cost him
to vanquish his own impetuous temper, he would
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>
for her sake endure all the mortifications to
which her brother's arrogance might expose him;
and after having stayed with her two days, and
enjoyed several private interviews, during which
he acted the part of a most passionate lover, he
took his leave of Mrs. Gauntlet over-night, and
told the young ladies he would call early next
morning, to bid them farewel. He did not neg∣lect
this piece of duty, and found the two friends
and breakfast already prepared in the parlour.
All three being extremely affected with the
thoughts of parting, a most pathetic silence for
some time prevailed, till Peregrine put an end to
it, by lamenting his fate, in being obliged to exile
himself so long from the dear object of his most
interesting wish; and begged with the most ear∣nest
supplications, that she would now, in con∣sideration
of the cruel absence he must suffer,
give him the consolation which she had hitherto
refused, namely, that of knowing he possessed
a place within her heart. The confidante se∣conded
his request, representing that it was now
no time to disguise her sentiments, when her
lover was about to leave the kingdom, and might
be in danger of contracting other connexions,
unless he was confirmed in his constancy, by
knowing how far he could depend upon her love;
and in short, she was plied with such irresistible
importuniti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that she answered in the utmost
confusion, “Tho' I have avoided literal ac∣knowledgments,
methinks the circumstances of
my behaviour might have convinced Mr. Pickle,
that I do not regard him as a common acquain∣tance.”
“My charming Emily! (cried the im∣patient
lover, throwing himself at her feet) why
will you deal out my happiness in such scanty
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
portions? Why will you thus mince the decla∣ration
which would overwhelm me with pleasure,
and chear my lonely reflection, while I sigh
amid the solitude of separation?” His fair mi∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess,
melted by this image, replied, with the
tears gushing from her eyes, “I'm afraid I shall
feel that sep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration more severely than you ima∣gine”
Transported at this flattering confession,
he pressed her to his breast, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le her head
re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lined upon his neck, mingled his tears with
hers in great abundance, and breathed the most
tender vows of eternal fidelity. The gentle heart
of Sophy could not bear this scene unmoved,
she wept with sympathy, and encouraged the lo∣vers
to resign themselves to the will of fate, and
support their spirits with the hope of meeting
again on happier terms. Finally, after mutual
promises, exhortations and endearments, Pere∣grine
took his leave, his heart being so full, that
he could scarce pronounce the word “<HI>Adieu!</HI>”
and mounting his horse at the door, set out with
Pipes for the garison.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is overtaken by Mr. Gauntlet, with
whom he fights a duel, and contracts an intimate
friendship. He arrives at the garison, and
finds his mother as implacable as ever. He is
insulted by his brother Gam, whose preceptor he
disciplines with a horse-whip.</HEAD>
<P>IN order to expel the melancholy images that
took possession of his fancy, at parting from
his mistress, he called in the flattering ideas of
those pleasures he expected to enjoy in France;
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>
and before he had rode ten miles, his imagination
was effectually amused.</P>
<P>While he thus prosecuted his travels by antici∣pation,
and indulged himself in all the insolence
of hope, at the truning of a lane he was all of
a sudden overtaken by Emilia's brother on horse∣back,
who told him he was riding the same way,
and should be glad of his company.</P>
<P>This young gentleman, whether prompted by
personal pique, or actuated with zeal for the
honour of his family, had followed our hero,
with a view of obliging him to explain the na∣ture
of his attachment to his sister. Peregrine
returned his compliment with such disdainful ci∣vility,
as gave him room to believe that he sus∣spected
his errand; and therefore, without fur∣ther
preamble, he declared his business in these
words: “Mr. Pickle, you have carried on a
correspondence with my sister for some time,
and I should be glad to know the nature of it?”
To this question our lover replied, “Sir, I
should be glad to know what title you have to
demand that satisfaction?” “Sir, (answered
the other) I demand it in the capacity of a bro∣ther,
jealous of his own honour, as well as of
his sister's reputation; and if your intentions are
honourable, you will not refuse it.” “Sir, (said
Peregrine) I am not at present disposed to appeal
to your opinion for the rectitude of my inten∣tions;
and I think you assume a little too much
improtance, in pretending to judge my conduct.”
“Sir, (replied the soldier) I pretend to judge
the conduct of every man who interferes with
my concerns, and even to chastise him, if I
think he acts amiss.” “Chastise! (cried the
youth, with indignation in his looks) sure you
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>
dare not apply that term to me?” “You are
mistaken (said Godfrey) I dare do any thing that
becomes the character of a gentleman.” “Gen∣tleman,
God wot! (replied the other, looking
contemptuously at his ewquipage, which was none
of the most superb) a very pretty gentleman,
truly!” The soldier's wrath was inflamed by
this ironical repetition, the contempt of which
his conscious poverty made him feel; and he
called his antagonist presumptuous boy, insolent
upstart, with other epithets, which Perry re∣torted
with great bitterness: and a formal chal∣lenge
having passed between them, they alighted
at the first inn, and walked into the next field,
in order to decide their quarrel by the sword.
Having pitched upon the spot, helped to pull off
each other's boots, and laid aside their coats and
waistcoats, Mr. Gauntlet told his opponent, that
he himself was looked upon in the army as an
expert swordsman, and that if Mr. Pickle had
not made that science his particular study, they
should be upon a more equal footing in using pi∣stols.
Peregrine was too much incensed to thank
him for his plain dealing, and too confident of
his own skill to relish the other's proposal, which
he accordingly rejected; and drawing his sword,
observed, that were he to treat Mr. Gauntlet ac∣cording
to his deserts, he would order his man to
punish his audacity with an horse-whip. Exas∣perated
at this expression, which he considered
as an indelible affront, he made no reply, but
attacked his adversary with equal ferocity and ad∣dress.
The youth parried his first and second
thrust, but received the third in the outside of
his sword arm. Though the wound was super∣ficial,
he was transported with rage at sight of
<PB N="236" REF="244"/>
his own blood, and returned the assault with
such fury and precipitation, that Gauntlet, loath
to take advantage of his unguarded heat, stood
upon the defensive; and in the second longe,
Peregrine's weapon entering a kind of net-work
in the shell of Godfrey's sword, the blade
snapped in two, and left him at the mercy of the
soldier, who, far from making an insolent use
of the victory he had gained, put up his Toledo
with great deliberation, like a man who had
been used to that kind of rencounters, observed
that such a blade as Peregrine's was not to be
trusted with a man's life, and advising the owner
to treat a gentleman in distress with more respect
for the future, slipped on his boots, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
sullen dignity of demeanour stalked back to the
inn.</P>
<P>Though Pickle was extremely mortified at his
miscarriage in this adventure, he was also struck
with the behaviour of his antagonist, which as∣sected
him the more, as he understood that God∣frey's
<HI>fiertè</HI> had proceeded from the jealous sen∣sibility
of a gentleman declined into the vale of
misfortune. Gauntlet's valour and moderation
induced him to put a favourable construction on
all those circumstances of that young soldier's
conduct, which before had given him disgust;
and though in any other case he would have in∣dustriously
avoided the least appearance of sub∣mission,
he followed his conqueror to the inn,
with a view of thanking him for his generous for∣bearance,
and of solliciting his friendship and
correspondence.</P>
<P>Godfrey had his foot in the stirrup to mount,
when Peregrine coming up to him, desired he
would defer his departure for a quarter of an
<PB N="237" REF="245"/>
hour, and favour him with a little private con∣versation.
The soldier, who mistook the mean∣ing
of the request, immediately quitted his horse,
and followed Pickle into a chamber, where he
expected to find a brace of pistols loaded on the
table; but he was very agreeably deceived, when
our hero, in the most respectful terms, acknow∣ledged
his noble department in the field, owned
that till then he had misunderstood his character,
and begged that he would honour him with his
intimacy and correspondence.</P>
<P>Gauntlet, who had seen undoubted proofs of
Peregrine's courage, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad considerably raised
him in his esteem, and had sense enough to per∣ceive
that this concession was not owing to any
sordid or sinister motive, embraced his offer with
demonstrations of infinite satisfaction; and when
he understood the terms on which Mr. Pickle
was with his sister, proffered his service in his
turn, either as agent, mediator, or confidant:
nay, to give this new friend a convincing proof
of his sincerity, he disclosed to him a passion
which he had for some time entertained for his
cousin Miss Sophy, though he durst not reveal
his sentiments to her father, lest he should be of∣fended
at his presumption, and withdraw his pro∣tection
from the family.</P>
<P>Peregrine's generous heart was wrung with
anguish, when he understood that this young
gentleman, who was the only son of a distin∣guished
officer, had carried arms for the space
of five years, without being able to obtain a sub∣altern's
commission, though he had always be∣haved
with remarkable regularity and spirit, and
acquired the friendship and esteem of all the of∣ficers
under whom he had served.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="246"/>
He would, at that time, with the utmost plea∣sure,
have shared his finances with him; but as
he would not run the risk of offending the young
soldier's delicacy of honour, by a premature ex∣ertion
of his liberality, he resolved to insinuate
himself into an intimacy with him, before he
would venture to take such freedoms; and with
that view pressed Mr. Gauntlet to accompany him
to the garison, where he did not doubt of hav∣ing
influence enough to make him a welcome
guest. Godfrey thanked him very courteously for
his invitation, which he said he could not imme∣diately
accept, but promised if he would favour
him with a letter, and fix the time at which he
proposed to set out for France, he would endea∣vour
to visit him at the commodore's habitation,
and from thence give him a convoy to Dover.
This new treaty being settled, and a dossil of lint
with a snip of plaister applied to our adventurer's
wound, he parted from the brother of his dear
Emilia, to whom and his friend Sophy he sent
his kindest wishes; and having lodged one night
upon the road, arrived next day in the afternoon
at the garison, where he found all his friends in
good health, and overjoyed at his return.</P>
<P>The commodore, who was by this time turned
of seventy, and altogether crippled by the gout,
seldom went abroad; and as his conversation was
not very entertaining, had but little company
within doors; so that his spirits must have quite
stagnated, had not they been kept in motion by
the conversation of Hatchway, and received at
different times an wholesome fillip from the dis∣cipline
of his spouse, who, by the force of pride,
religion and Coniac, had erected a most terrible
tyranny in the house. There was such a quick
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>
circulation of domesticks in the family, that every
suit of livery had been worn by figures of all di∣mensions:
Trunnion himself had long before
this time yielded to the torrent of her arbitrary
sway; though not without divers obstinate ef∣forts
to maintain his liberty; and now, that he
was disabled by his iufirmities, when he used to
hear his empress singing the loud Orthyan song
among the servants below, he would often in
whispers communicate to the lieutenant, hints of
what he would do if so be he was not deprived of
the use of his precious limbs. Hatchway was the
only person whom the temper of Mrs. Trunnion
respected, either because she dreaded his ridicule,
or looked upon his person with the eyes of affec∣tion.
This being the situation of things in the
garison, it is not to be doubted that the old gen∣tleman
highly enjoyed the presence of Peregrine,
who found means to ingratiate himself so effec∣tually
with his aunt, that while he remained at
home, she seemed to have exchanged the disposi∣tion
of a tygress, for that of a gentle kid; but he
found his own mother as implacable, and his fa∣ther
as much hen-pecked as ever.</P>
<P>Gamaliel, who now very seldom enjoyed the
conversation of his old friend the commodore,
had some time ago entered into an amicable so∣ciety,
consisting of the barber, apothecary, at∣torney
and exciseman of the parish, among whom
he used to spend the evening at Tunley's, and
listen to their disputes upon philosophy and poli∣ticks,
with great comfort and edification, while
his sovereign lady domineered at home as usual,
visited with great pomp in the neighbourhood,
and employed her chief care in the education of
her darling son Gam, who was now in the fif∣teenth
<PB N="240" REF="248"/>
year of his age, and so remarkable for his
perverse disposition, that in spite of his mother's
influence and authority, he was not only hated,
but also despised both at home and abroad. She
had put him under the tuition of the curate who
lived in the family, and was obliged to attend him
in all his exercises and excursions. This governor
was a low bred fellow, who had neither experi∣ence
nor ingenuity, but possessed a large fund of
adulation and servile complaisance, by which he
had gained the good graces of Mrs. Pickle, and
presided over all her deliberations in the same
manner as his superior managed those of Mrs.
Trunnion.</P>
<P>He had one day rode out to take the air with
his pupil, who, as I have already observed, was
odious to the poor people, for having killed their
dogs and broken their inclosures, and on account
of his hump, distinguished by the title of my
lord; when in a narrow lane they chanced to
meet Peregrine on horseback.</P>
<P>The young squire no sooner perceived his elder
brother, for whom he had been instructed to en∣tertain
the most inveterate grudge, than he re∣solved
to insult him <HI>en passant,</HI> and actually rode
against him full gallop. Our hero guessing his aim,
fixed himself in his stirrups, and by a dexterous
management of the reins, avoided the shock in
such a manner, as that their legs only should en∣counter,
by which means my lord was tilted out
of his saddle, and in a twinkling laid sprawling in
the dirt. The governor enraged at the disgrace
of his charge, advanced with great insolence and
fury, and struck at Peregrine with his whip. No∣thing
could be more agreeable to our young gen∣tleman
than this assault, which furnished him
<PB N="241" REF="249"/>
with an opportunity of chastising an officious
wretch, whose petulance and malice he had longed
to punish. He therefore, spurring up his horse
towards his antagonist, overthrew him in the
middle of a hedge; and before he had time to
recollect himself from the confusion of the fall,
alighted in a trice, and exercised his horse-whip
with such agility about the curate's face and ears,
that he was fain to prostrate himself before his
enraged conqueror, and implore his forbearance
in the most abject terms. While Peregrine was
thus employed, his brother Gam had made shift
to rise, and attack him in the rear; for which
reason, when the tutor was quelled, the victor
faced about, snatched the weapon out of his
hand, and having broken it to pieces, remounted
his horse, and rode off, without deigning to ho∣nour
him with any other notice.</P>
<P>The condition in which they returned pro∣duced
infinite clamour against the conqueror, who
was represented as a ruffian who had lain in am∣bush
to make away with his brother, in whose
defence the curate was said to have received those
cruel stripes, that hindered him from appearing
for three whole weeks in the performance of his
duty at church.</P>
<P>Complaints were made to the commodore, who
having inquired into the circumstances of the af∣fair,
approved of what his nephew had done;
adding, with many oaths, that, provided Pere∣grine
had been out of the scrape, he wished Crook∣back
had broke his neck in the fall.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He projects a plan of revenge, which is executed
against the curate.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero, exasperated at the villainy of the
curate, in the treacherous misrepresentation
he had made of this rencounter, determined to
practise upon him a method of revenge, which
should be not only effectual, but also unattended
with any bad consequence to himself. For this
purpose he and Hatchway, to whom he imparted
his plan, went to the alehouse one evening, and
called for an empty room, knowing there was
no other but that which they had chosen for the
scene of action. This apartment was a sort of a
parlour that fronted the kitchen, with a window
towards the yard; where, after they had sat
some time, the lieutenant found means to amuse
the landlord in discourse, while Peregrine step∣ping
out into the yard, by the talent of mimickry,
which he possessed in a surprising degree, coun∣terfeited
a dialogue between the curate and Tun∣ley's
wife; which reaching the ears of the pub∣lican,
for whose hearing it was calculated, in∣flamed
his naturally jealous disposition to such a
degree, that he could not conceal his emotion,
but made an hundred efforts to quit the room;
while the lieutenant, smoaking his pipe with great
gravity, as if he neither heard what passed, nor
took notice of the landlord's disorder, detained
him on the spot by a succession of questions
which he could not refuse to answer; though he
stood sweating with agony all the time, stretching
his neck every instant towards the window thro'
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
which the voices were conveyed, scratching his
head, and exhibiting sundry other symptoms of
impatience and agitation. At length, the sup∣posed
conversation came to such a pitch of amo∣rous
complaisance, that the husband, quite frantic
with his imaginary disgrace, rushed out at the
door, crying, “Coming, Sir.” But, as he was
obliged to make a circuit round one half of the
house, Peregrine had got in by the window, be∣fore
Tunley arrived in the yard.</P>
<P>According to the feigned intelligence he had
received, he ran directly to the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn, in expecta∣tion
of making some very extraordinary disco∣very;
and having employed some minutes in
rummaging the straw to no purpose, returned in
a state of distraction to the kitchen,just as his
wife chanced to enter at the other door. The
circumstance of her appearance confirmed him
in the opinion, that the deed was done; but as
the disease of being hen-peck'd was epidemic in
the parish, he durst not express the least hint of
his uneasiness to her, but resolved to take ven∣geance
on the libidinous priest, who, he ima∣gined,
had corrupted the chastity of his spouse.</P>
<P>The two confederates, in order to be certi∣fied
that their scheme had taken effect, as well
as to blow up the flame which they had kindled,
called for Tunley, in whose countenance they
could easily discern his confusion; and Peregrine
desiring him to sit down and drink a glass with
them, began to interrogate him about his family,
and among other things, asked him how long he
had been married to that handsome wife? This
question, which was put with an arch significance
of look, alarmed the publican, who begin to
fear that Pickle had overheard his dishonour; and
<PB N="244" REF="252"/>
this suspicion was not at all removed, when the
lieutenant, with a sly regard, pronounced, “Tun∣ley,
wan't you noosed by the curate?” “Yes, I
was,” (replied the landlord, with an eagerness
and perplexity of tone, as if he thought the lieu∣tenant
knew, that <HI>thereby hangs a tale;</HI>) and
Hatchway supported this suspicion, by answering,
“Nay, as for that matter, the curate may be a
very sufficient man in his way.” This transition
from his wife to the curate, convinced him that
his shame was known to his guests; and in the
transport of his indignation, he pronounced with
great emphasis, “A sufficient man! Odds heart!
I believe they are all wolves in sheeps cloathing.
I wish to God I could see the day, master, when
there shall not be a priest, an exciseman, or a
custom-house officer in this kingdom. As for
that fellow of a curate, if I do catch him—It
don't signify talking—But, by the Lord!—
Gentlemen, my service to you.”</P>
<P>The associates being satisfied by these abrupt
insinuations, that they had so far succeeded in
their aim, waited with impatience two or three
days, in expectation of hearing that Tunley had
fallen upon some method of being revenged for
this imaginary wrong: but finding that either his
invention was too shallow, or his inclination too
languid to gratify their desire of his own accord,
they determined to bring the affair to such a cri∣sis,
that he should not be able to withstand the
opportunity of executing his vengeance. With
this view, they one evening hired a boy to run
to Mr. Pickle's house, and tell the curate, that
Mrs. Tunley being taken suddenly ill, her hus∣band
desired he would come immediately, and
pray with her. Mean while, they had taken
<PB N="245" REF="253"/>
possession of a room in the house; and Hatch∣way
engaging the landlord in conversation, Pe∣regrine
in his return from the yard observed, as
if by accident, that the parson was gone into the
kitchen, in order, as he supposed, to cat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chise
Tunley's wife.</P>
<P>The publican started at this intelligence, and
under pretence of serving another company in
the next room, went out to the barn, and arm∣ing
himself with a flail, repaired to a lane thro'
which the curate was under a necessity of passing
in his way home. There he lay in ambush, with
fell intent; and when the supposed author of his
shame arrived, greeted him in the dark with such
a salutation, as forced him to stagger backward
three paces at least. If the second application had
taken effect, in all probability that spot would have
been the boundary of the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son's mortal peregri∣nation;
but, luckily for him, his antagonist was
not expert in the management of his weapon,
which, by a twist of the thong that connected
the legs, instead of pitching upon the head of the
astonished curate, descended in an oblique di∣rection
on his own pate, with such a swing, that
the skull actually rung like an apothecary's mor∣tar,
and ten thousand lights seemed to dance be∣fore
his eyes. The curate recollecting himself
during the respite he obtained from this accident,
and believing his aggressor to be some thief who
lurked in that place for prey, resolved to make a
running fight, until he should arrive within cry
of his habitation. With this design he raised up
his cudgel for the defence of his head, and be∣taking
himself to his heels, began to roar for help
with the lungs of a Stentor. Tunley throwing
away the flail, which he durst no longer trust
<PB N="246" REF="254"/>
with the execution of his revenge, pursued the
fugitive with all the speed he could exert; and
the other, either unnerv'd by fear, or stum∣bling
over a stone, was overtaken before he had
run an hundred paces. He no sooner felt the
wind of the publican's fist that whistled round
his ears, than he fell flat upon the earth at full
length, and the cudgel flew from his unclasping
hand; when Tunley springing like a tyger upon
his back, rained such a shower of blows upon his
carcase, that he imagined himself under the disci∣pline
of ten pair of fists at least: yet the imagi∣nary
cuckold, not satisfied with annoying the
priest in this manner, laid hold on one of his ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
with his teeth, and bit so unmercifully, that the
curate was found almost intranced with pain by
two labourers, at whose approach the assailant re∣treated
unperceived.</P>
<P>The lieutenant had posted himself at the win∣dow,
in order to see the landlord at his first re∣turn;
and no sooner perceived him enter the
yard, than he called him into the apartment,
impatient to learn the effects of their stratagem.
Tunley obeyed the summons, and appeared be∣fore
his guests in all the violence of rage, disor∣der
and fatigue; his nostrils were dilated more
than one half beyond their natural capacity, his
eyes rolled, his teeth chattered, he snored in
breathing as if he had been oppressed by the night∣mare,
and streams of sweat flowed down each
side of his forehead.</P>
<P>Peregrine affecting to start at the approach of
such an uncouth figure, asked if he had been
wrestling with a spirit; upon which he answered
with great vehemence, “Spirit! No, no, ma∣ster,
I have had a roll and tumble with the flesh.
<PB N="247" REF="255"/>
A dog! I'll teach him to come a caterwauling
about my doors.” Guessing from this reply, that
his aim was accomplished, and curious to know
the particulars of the rencounter, “Well then,
(said the youth) I hope you have prevailed against
the flesh, Tunley.” “Yes, yes, (answered the
publican) I have cooled his capissens, as the say∣ing
is; I have played such a tune about his ears,
that I'll be bound he shan't long for musick this
month. A goatish ram-fac'd rascal! Why,
he's a perfect parish bull, as I hope to live.”</P>
<P>Hatchway observing that he seemed to have
made a stout battle, desired he would sit down
and recover wind; and after he had swallowed a
brace of bumpers, his vanity prompted him to ex∣patiate
upon his own exploit in such a manner,
that the confederates, without seeming to know
the curate was his antagonist, became acquainted
with every circumstance of the ambuscade.</P>
<P>Tunley had scarce got the better of his agita∣tion,
when his wife entering the room, told
them by way of news, that some waggish body
had sent Mr. Sackbut the curate to pray with her.
This name inflamed the husband's choler anew,
and forgetting all his complaisance for his spouse,
he replied with a rancorous grin, “Add rabbit
him! I doubt not but you found his admonitions
deadly comfortable!” The landlady, looking
at her vassal with a sovereign aspect, “What
crotchets (said she) have you got in your fool's
head, I trow? I know no business you have to
sit here like a gentleman with you arms akimbo,
when there's another company in the house to be
served.” The submissive husband took the hint,
and without further expostulation, sneaked out
of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="256"/>
Next day it was reported, that Mr. Sackbut
had been way-laid, and almost murdered by rob∣bers,
and an advertisement pasted upon the church-door,
offering a reward to any pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that should
discover the assassin; but he reaped no satisfac∣tion
from this expedient, and was confined to his
chamber a whole fortnight, by the bruises he had
received.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Sackbut and his pupil conspire against Pere∣grine,
who being apprized o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their design by his

Gauntlet.This young soldier meets with a
cordial reception from the commodore, who gene∣rously
decoys him into his own interest.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN he considered the circumstances
of the ambuscade, he could not per∣suade
himself that he had been assaulted by a com∣mon
thief, because it was not to be supposed that
a robber would have amused himself in pum∣meling
rather than in rifling his prey; he there∣fore
ascribed his misfortune to the secret enmity
of some person who had a design upon his life;
and upon mature deliberation, fixed his suspicion
upon Peregrine, who was the only man on earth
from whom he thought he deserved such treat∣ment.
He communicated this conjecture to his
pupil, who readily adopted his opinion, and ad∣vised
him strenuously to revenge the wrong by
a like contrivance, without seeking to make a
narrower inquiry, lest his enemy should be there∣by
put upon his guard.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="257"/>
This proposal being relished, they in concert
revolved the means of retorting the ambush with
interest, and actually laid such a villainous plan
for attacking our hero in the dark, that, had it
been executed according to their intention, the
young gentleman's scheme of travelling would
have been effectually marred. But their machi∣nations
were overheard by Miss Pickle, who was
now in the seventeenth year of her age, and, in
spite of the prejudice of education, entertained
in secret a most sisterly affection for her brother
Perry, though she had never spoke to him, and
was deterred by the precepts, vigilance and me∣naces
of her mother, from attempting any means
of meeting him in private. She was not▪ how∣ever,
insensible to his praise, which was loudly
sounded forth in the neighbourhood, and never
failed of going to church, and every other place,
where she thought she might have an opportunity
of seeing this amiable brother. With these sen∣timents
it cannot be supposed that she would hear
the conspiracy without emotion. She was shocked
at the treacherous barbarity of Gam, and shud∣dered
at the prospect of the danger to which Pe∣regrine
would be exposed from their malice. She
durst not communicate this plot to her mother,
because she was afraid that lady's unaccountable
aversion for her first-born would hinder her from
interposing in his behalf, and consequently render
her a sort of accomplice in the guilt of his as∣sassins.
She therefore resolved to warn Peregrine
of the conspiracy, an account of which she trans∣mitted
to him in an affectionate letter, by means
of a young gentleman in that neighbourhood,
who made his addresses to her at that time, and
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>
who, at her request, offered his service to our
hero, in de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eating the projects of his adversaries.</P>
<P>Peregrine was startled when he read the parti∣culars
of their scheme, which was no other than
an intention to sally upon him when he should
be altogether unprovided against such an attack,
cut off his ears, and otherwise mutilate him in
such a manner, that he should have no cause to
be vain of his person for the future.</P>
<P>Incensed as he was against the brutal disposi∣tion
of his own father's son, he could not help
being moved at the integrity and tenderness of
his sister, of whose inclinations towards him he
had been hitherto kept in ignorance. He thanked
the gentleman for his honourable dealing, and
expressed a desire of being better acquainted with
his virtues; told him, that now he was cautioned,
he hoped there would be no necessity for giving
him any further trouble, and wrote by him a
letter of acknolwedgment to his sister, for whom
he expressed the utmost love and regard, be∣seeching
her to favour him with an interview be∣fore
his departure, that he might indulge his fra∣ternal
fondness, and be blessed with the company
and countenance of one at least belonging to his
own family.</P>
<P>Having imparted this discovery to his friend
Hatchway, they came to a resolution of counter∣mining
the plan of their enemies; and as they
did not choose to expose themselves to the insi∣nuations
of slander, which would have exerted
itself at their expence, had they, even in de∣fending
themselves, employed any harsh means of
retal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, they invented a method of disap∣pointing
and disgracing their foes, and imme∣diately
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>
set Pipes at work to forward the prepa∣rations.</P>
<P>Miss Pickle having described the spot which
the assassins had pitched upon for the scene of
their vengeance, our triumvirate intended to
have placed a centinel among the corn, who
should come and give them intelligence when the
ambuscade was laid; and in consequence of that
information, they would steal softly towards the
place, attended by three or four of the do∣mesticks,
and draw a large net over the conspi∣rators,
who being intangled in the toil, should
be disarmed, fettered, heartily scourged, and sus∣pended
between two trees in the snare, as a spec∣tacle
to all passengers that should chance to travel
that way.</P>
<P>The plan being thus digested, and the com∣modore
made acquainted with the whole affair,
the spy was sent upon duty, and every body
within doors prepared to go forth upon the first
notice. One whole evening did they spend in the
most impatient expectation, but on the second
their scout crept into the garison, and assured
them that he had perceived three men skulk∣ing
behind the hedge, on the road that led to
the publick house from which Peregrine and the
lieutenant used every night to return about that
hour. Upon this intelligence the confederates
set out immediately with all their implements,
and approaching the scene with as little noise as
possible, they heard the sound of blows; and
though the night was dark, perceived a sort of
tumultuous conflict on the very spot which the
conspirators had possessed. Surprised at this oc∣currence,
the meaning of which he could not
comprehend, Peregrine ordered his myrmidons
<PB N="252" REF="260"/>
to halt and reconnoitre; and immediately his ears
were saluted with an exclamation of “You
shan't scape me, rasscal.” The voice being quite
familiar to him, he all at once divined the cause
of that confusion which they had observed; and
running up to the assistance of the exclaimer,
found a fellow on his knees begging his life of
Mr. Gauntlet, who stood over him with a naked
hanger in his hand.</P>
<P>Pickle instantly made himself known to his
friend, who told him, that having left his horse
at Tunley's, he was in his way to the garison set
upon by three ruffians, one of whom, being the
very individual person now in his power, had
come behind him, and struck with a bludgeon at
his head, which however he missed, and the in∣strument
descended on his left shoulder; that up∣on
drawing his hanger, and laying abut him in
the dark, the other two fled, leaving their com∣panion,
whom he had disabled, in the lurch.</P>
<P>Peregrine congratulated him upon his safety,
and having ordered Pipes to secure the prisoner,
conducted Mr. Gauntlet to the garison, where he
met with a very hearty reception from the com∣modore,
to whom he was introduced as his ne∣phew's
intimate friend; not but that, in all like∣lihood,
he would have abated somewhat of his
hospitality, had he known that he was the bro∣ther
of Perry's mistress; but her name the old
gentleman had never thought of asking, when
he inquired into the particulars of his godson's
amour.</P>
<P>The captive being examined, in presence of
Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnion and all his adherents, touching the am∣buscade,
owned, that being in the service of
G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Pickle, he had been prevailed upon by the
<PB N="253" REF="261"/>
sollicitations of his master and the curate, to ac∣company
them in their expedition, and under∣take
the part which he had acted against the
stranger, whom he and his employers mistook
for Peregrine. In consideration of this frank ac∣knowledgment,
and a severe wound he had re∣ceived
in his right arm, they resolved to inflict
no other punishment on this malefactor, than to
detain him all night in the garison, and next
morning carry him before a justice of the peace,
to whom he repeated all that he had said over∣night,
and with his own hand subscribed his con∣fession,
copies of which were handed about the
neighbourhood, to the unspeakable confusion and
disgrace of the curate and his promising pupil.</P>
<P>Mean while, Trunnion treated the young sol∣dier
with uncommon marks of respect, being pre∣possessed
in his favour by this adventure, which
he had so gallantly atchieved, as well as by the
encomiums that Peregrine bestowed upon his va∣lour
and generosity. He liked his countenance,
which was bold and hardy, admired his Hercu∣lean
limbs, and delighted in asking questions con∣cerning
the service he had seen.</P>
<P>The day after his arrival, while the conversa∣tion
turned on this last subject, the commodore,
taking the pipe out of his mouth, “I'll tell you
what, brother, (said he) five and forty years ago,
when I was third lieutenant of the Warwick
man of war, there was a very stout young fel∣low
on board, a subaltern officer of marines;
his name was not unlike your own, d'ye see,
being Guntlet, with a G. I remember he and
I could not abide one another at first, because,
d'ye see, I was a sailor and he a land-man, till
we fell in with a Frenchman, whom we engaged
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
for eight glasses, and at length boarded and
took. I was the first man that stood on the
enemy's deck, and should have come scurvily
off, d'ye see, if Guntlet had not jumped to my
assistance; but we soon cleared ship, and drove
them to close quarters, so that they were obliged
to strike; and from that day Guntlet and I were
sworn brothers as long as he remained on board.
He was exchanged into a marching regiment,
and what became of him afterwards, Lord in
heaven knows; but this I'll say of him, whether
he be dead or alive, he feared no man that ever
wore a head, and was, moreover, a very hearty
messmate.”</P>
<P>The stranger's breast glowed at this eulogium,
which was no sooner pronounced, than he ea∣gerly
asked, if the French ship was not the Di∣ligence?
The commodore replied with a stare,
“The very same, my lad.” “Then (said
Gauntlet) the person of whom you are pleased
to make such honourable mention was my own
father.” “The devil he was! (cried Trun∣nion,
shaking him by the hand) I am rejoiced
to see a son of Ned Gauntlet in my house.”</P>
<P>This discovery introduced a thousand questions,
in the course of which, the old gentleman learnt
the situation of his friend's family, and discharged
innumerable execrations upon the ingratitude and
injustice of the ministry, which had failed to pro∣vide
for the son of such a brave soldier. Nor
was h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s friendship confined to such in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffectual ex∣pressions;
he that same evening signified to Pe∣regrine
a desire of doing something for his friend;
and this inclination was so much praised, en∣couraged
and promoted by his godson, and even
supported by his counsellor Hatchway, that our
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>
hero was empowered to present him with a sum
of money sufficient to purchase a commission.</P>
<P>Though nothing could be more agreeable to
Pickle than this permission, he was afraid that
Godfrey's scrupulous disposition would hinder
him from subjecting himself to any such obliga∣tion;
and therefore proposed that he should be
decoyed into his own interest by a feigned story,
in consequence of which he would be prevailed
upon to accept of the money, as a debt which
the commodore had contracted of his father at
sea. Trunnion made wry faces at this expedient,
the necessity of which he could not conceive,
without calling in question the common sense of
Gauntlet, as he took it for granted, that such
offers as those were not to be rejected on any
consideration whatever. Besides, he could not
digest an artifice, by which he himself must own
that he had lived so many years, without mani∣festing
the least intention of doing justice to his
creditor. All these objections, however, were
removed by the zeal and rhetoric of Peregrine,
who represented that it would be impossible to
befriend him on any other terms; that his silence
hitherto would be imputed to his want of infor∣mation
touching the circumstances and condition
of his friend; and that his remembring and in∣sisting
upon discharging the obligation, after such
an interval of time, when the whole affair was
in oblivion, would be the greatest compliment
he could pay to his own honour and integrity.</P>
<P>Thus persuaded, he took an opportunity of
Gauntlet's being alone with him to broach the
affair, telling the young man, that his father had
advanced a sum of money for him, when they
sailed together, on account of the mess, as well
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>
as to stop the mouth of a clamorous creditor at
Portsmouth; and that the said sum, with in∣terest,
amounted to about four hundred pounds,
which he would now, with great thankfulness,
repay.</P>
<P>Godfrey was amazed at this declaration, and
after a considerable pause replied, that he had
never heard his parents mention any such debt;
that no memorandum or voucher of it was found
among his father's papers; and that, in all proba∣bility,
it must have been discharged long ago, al∣though
the commodore, in such a long course of
time and hurry of occupation, might have forgot
the repayment: he therefore desired to be excused
from accepting what in his own conscience he be∣lieved
was not his due; and complimented the
old gentleman upon his being so scrupulously just
and honourable.</P>
<P>The soldier's refusal, which was matter of
astonishment to Trunnion, increased his inclina∣tion
to assist him; and, on pretence of acquitting
his own character, he urged his beneficence with
such obstinacy, that Gauntlet, afraid of disobliging
him, was in a manner compelled to receive a
draught for the money, for which he subscribed
an ample discharge, and immediately transmitted
the order to his mother, whom at the same time
he informed of the circumstances by which they
had so unexpectedly gained this accession of for∣tune.</P>
<P>Such a piece of news could not fail of being
agreeable to Mrs. Gauntlet, who by the first post
wrote a polite letter of acknowledgment to the
commodore, another to her own son, importing,
that she had already sent the draught to a friend
in London, with directions to deposit it in the
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>
hands of a certain banker, for the purchase of
the first ensigncy to be sold; and she took the
liberty of sending a third to Peregrine, couched
in very affectionate terms, with a kind postscript,
signed by Miss Sophy and his charming Emily.</P>
<P>This affair being transacted to the satisfaction
of all concerned, preparations were set on foot
for the departure of our hero, on whom his uncle
settled an annuity of eight hundred pounds, being
little less than one half of his whole income.
By this time indeed the old gentleman could
easily afford to alienate such a part of his fortune,
because he entertained little or no company, kept
few servants, was remarkably plain and frugal in
his house-keeping; and Mrs. Trunnion being
now some years on the wrong side of fifty, her
infirmities began to increase; and tho' her pride
had suffered no diminution, her vanity was alto∣gether
subdued by her avarice.</P>
<P>A Swiss valet de chambre, who had already
made the tour of Europe, was hired for the care
of Peregrine's own person; and Pipes being ig∣norant
of the French language, as well as other∣wise
unfit for the office of a fashionable attendant,
it was resolved that he should remain in garison,
and his place was immediately supplied by a Pari∣sian
lacquey engaged at London for that purpose.
Pipes did not seem to relish this disposition of
things; and though he made no verbal objections
to it, looked remarkably sour at his successor upon
his first arrival; but this sullen fit seemed gra∣dually
to wear off; and long before his master's
departure, he had recovered his natural tranquil∣lity
and unconcern.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The two young gentlemen display their talents for
gallantry, in the course of which they are in∣volved
in a ludicrous circumstance of distress, and
afterwards take vengeance on the author of their
mishap.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while our hero and his new friend,
together with honest Jack Hatchway,
made daily excursions into the country, visited
the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, and fre∣quently
accompanied them to the chace; all three
being exceedingly caressed on account of their
talents, which could accommodate themselves
with great facility to the tempers and turns of
their entertainers. The lieutenant was a droll in
his way, Peregrine possessed a great fund of
sprightliness and good humour, and Godfrey, a∣mong
his other qualifications already recited,
sung a most excellent song; so that the company
of this triumvirate was courted in all parties, whe∣ther
male or female; and if the hearts of our
young gentlemen had not been pre-engaged, they
would have met with opportunities in abundance
of displaying their address in the art of love; not
but that they gave a loose to their gallantry with∣out
much interesting their affections, and amused
themselves with little intrigues, which, in the
opinion of a man of pleasure, do not affect his
fidelity to the acknowledged sovereign of his soul.</P>
<P>Had they used those advantages which their
skill and accomplishments gave them over the
warm unpractised minds of the young ladies to
whom they had access, almost every family in the
<PB N="259" REF="267"/>
county, might have had cause to rue their ac∣quaintance;
but our adventurers, wild and licen∣tious
as they were, governed their actions by cer∣tain
notions of honour, which they never pre∣sumed
to infringe, and therefore, no domestic
tragedies took rise from their behaviour.</P>
<P>Among the lower class of people, they did not
act with the same virtuous moderation, but laid
close siege to every buxom country damsel that
fell in their way; imagining that their dalliance
with such Dulcineas could produce no fatal ef∣fects;
and that it would be in their power to at∣tone
for any damage these inamorata's might
sustain.</P>
<P>In the prosecution of these amours, Gauntlet
could not help discovering a particular biass to∣wards
married women, and when questioned by
his friend, defended his singularity of taste, by
observing that such connections, if discreetly ma∣naged,
are attended by none of those bad conse∣quences
which commonly pursue an amorous cor∣respondence
with single persons; because the
wedded dame's fortune is already made, and her
husband stands as a buttress before her reputation.</P>
<P>Though Peregrine could not approve of this
maxim which the soldier had adopted in the course
of a military education, he could not avoid en∣gaging
as a second and confidant to his friend, in
an intrigue which he carried on with a farmer's
wife in the neighbourhood. Godfrey had prac∣tised
all his arts in attempting to overcome the
chastity of this woman, who was an hale rosy
wench, lately married; and at length succeeded
so far in his addresses, that she promised to admit
him one night when her husband would be absent
<PB N="260" REF="268"/>
on business, which called him once a fortnight
to the next market town.</P>
<P>He communicated his good fortune to Perry,
desiring that he would accompany him to the
place, in case of accident; and our young gentle∣man
having undertaken the office of standing
centinel over his friend, while he should enjoy
his conquest, they set out at the time appointed,
and arriving at the door, the gallant made the
signal which had been agreed upon, and was let
in accordingly, after having assured his confidant
that he would be with him again in two hours at farthest.</P>
<P>Thus left to his own meditations, our hero be∣gan
his patrole, beguiling the time with the most
amusing fancies of a glowing imagination, and
enjoying by anticipation all the pleasures attend∣ing
affluence and youth, till at length his reverse
was interrupted by a plump shower that compelled
him to seek for shelter in a sort of shed, the door
of which stood open to his view. Thither there∣fore
he betook himself, and groping about as he
entered in the dark, chanced to lay hold on a
bushy beard, to his infinite surprize and consterna∣tion.
Before he had time to form any conjecture
concerning this strange object of his touch, he
received a sudden shock upon his forehead that
felled him to the ground in an instant, and as he
lay, underwent the trampling of a huge body that
rushed over him into the field. In this attitude he
remained extended for the space of several mi∣nutes,
before he recovered the use of sensation
which he had lost, and then he perceived the
blood trickling down from his temples in a double
stream. The cause of this misfortune was still a
mystery to him, and he made shift to rise, curs∣ing
<PB N="261" REF="269"/>
his fate for having sustained such visible marks
of disgrace in the exercise of such a ridiculous of∣fice;
when strolling about with his handkerchief
applied to his hurts, he discerned on the farther
side of a tree a pair of large eyes glancing like
two coals of fire. He immediately unsheathed his
hanger, in the belief that now he had found the
author of his mischance; and springing forward
on his adversary, aimed a furious stroke that en∣tered
the body of the tree, in which his weapon
stuck so fast, that he could not disengage it with∣out
some difficulty; while the object of his wrath
made a precipitate retreat, and by an exclama∣tion,
gave him to know that his assailant was no
other than an he-goat.</P>
<P>Mad as he was with indignation and shame, he
could not help laughing at the ludicrous adven∣ture,
and had just set his invention at work to
find some plausible excuse which he might make
to the world, for the patches he knew he must
wear on his face, when a window of the first
story flying open, he saw something white de∣scend
with astonishing velocity, and running to
the spot, found his friend Godfrey naked to the
shirt. Confounded at his condition, he began to
inquire into the reason of his precipitation, but
received no answer until he had followed the fu∣gitive
to a place where they could not be over∣heard.
There he understood that the soldier had
been decoyed into the snare by the connivance of
the husband, by whose direction he had (without
all doubt) been admitted not only into the house,
but even into his wife's own bed, where the jilt
had left him undressed, on pretence of fastening
the doors, but in reality with a view of giving the
hint to the farmer, who armed with a pitchfork
<PB N="262" REF="270"/>
and supported by his man, entered the room be∣fore
he was aware, secured his sword and cloaths,
and obliged him to take refuge in closet, from
the window of which he had thrown himself, in
order to avoid the resentment of the boor, and
the disgrace as well as expence of being taken in
that situation.</P>
<P>Peregrine was tempted to laugh at the ridicu∣lous
issue of this adventure, but restrained him∣self
in consideration of his friend's temper and
condition, neither of which were at that time
proper objects of mirth; and stripping off his own
coat, accommodated Godfrey's naked shoulders;
then after mature deliberation, they determined
to leave the spoil in the hands of the enemy, be∣cause
they foresaw it would be altoghether imprac∣ticable
to retrieve it, as well as hazardous both
to their person and reputation, to make any at∣tempt
towards the recovery of what was lost;
the two friends, therefore, made their retreat in
this trim to the garison, and the farmer remained
in possession of all the soldier's cloaths, sword and
ready money, to the amount of ten pounds. But
here the disaster did not end, the malicious pea∣sant
propagated the whole story in the neighbour∣hood,
and an advertisement was pasted on the
church door, for the perusal of the whole parish,
giving a description of the goods, signifying the
place where they were found, and offering to
restore them to any person who should prove
himself the right owner. This was a mortifying
joke to Gauntlet, who was ashamed to shew
himself for a whole week; nor was Peregrine
exempted from a share of the disgrace, to which
he was exposed by the marks on his forehead,
that confined him also to the house, and subjected
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
him to the ridicule of the commodore, who hav∣ing
heard the story, rallied the two adventurers,
observing that it was well Gauntlet's mast had
not gone along with his rigging; and asking if
the cockold's horns had run foul of Peregrine's
bows. Mrs. Trunnion, who chanced to be pre∣sent,
very demurely checked her husband for his
profane scoffing, and in a severe lecture, rebuked
the young men for their profligate courses, which,
if they were not relinquished in time, would
bring their bodies into trouble in this life, and
their souls into perdition in that which is to come.
While these fellow-sufferers were obliged to keep
within doors, they held frequent consultations
with the lieutenant, concerning some means of
revenge, which the soldier was bent upon taking;
because he could not forgive the double dealing of
his mistress, who, he thought, might have de∣clined
his solicitations, without inveigling him
into such a disgraceful situation. After much de∣liberation,
they resolved to wait patiently, and
watch for the husband's absence, when by a stra∣tagem
they had concerted, they would endea∣vour
to obtain admittance<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and punish the wife's
perfidy, by fixing her as a monument,with her
posteriors thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st out at a window, for the con∣templation
of her spouse when he should return
in the morning.</P>
<P>The plan being laid, Peregrine found means
to make himself acquainted with the farmer's
voice and manner of speaking, which he over∣heard
one night at Tunley's; and likewise to
procure information of the day upon which he
always went to a certain market, in order to dis∣pose
of his wheat, at such a distance, that he
seldom failed of being abroad all night. Accord∣ing
<PB N="264" REF="272"/>
to this intelligence, the confederates attended
by Pipes, set out one evening about nine o'clock
for the house of the delinquent, where the lieu∣tenant
and Tom being placed at different ave∣nues
to prevent interruption, the two young gen∣tlemen
approached the door which was locked,
and Peregrine in the rustic tone of the farmer de∣manded
entrance; the wife never doubting that
her husband was returned, in consequence of
having met with a speedier sale than usual, sent
her maid to let him in, and the door was no
sooner opened, than our adventurers rushed into
the house. The mistress was struck dumb with
consternation, mistaking them for robbers, be∣cause
they wore vizors, and were otherwise dis∣guised;
while the servant wench, terrified with
the same apprehension, fell upon her knees, and
begged they would spare her life and take all she
had. Gauntlet taking the wife by the hand, led
her trembling into that very chamber which had
been the scene of his misfortune, where pulling
off his mask, he upbraided her with the treachery
she had practised upon him, and intimated the
intention of his present visit. The lady asked
pardon for what she had done with such submis∣sion,
and deprecated his wrath so pathetically,
that his heart relented, and he proposed terms of
accommodation, which with some seeming re∣luctance
she embraced, and he forthwith enjoyed
a more agreeable revenge than that which he in
his ire had projected.</P>
<P>Mean while Peregrine guessing the good for∣tune
of his friend, and allured by the attractions
of the maid, who was a cleanly florid girl, em∣ployed
his address to such effectual purpose, that
<PB N="265" REF="273"/>
she yielded to his efforts; and he was as happy as
such a conquest could make him.</P>
<P>The soldier and his companion having thus ob∣tained
all the satisfaction they required, and fet∣tled
a correspondence which they did not after∣wards
neglect, retired in peace, applauding them∣selves
on their success, and found their two cen∣tinels
on their posts, whom they amused with a
feigned story of having been so much moved by
the tears and supplications of the criminal, that
they desisted from their scheme of exposing her,
and only inflicted the punishment of flagellation,
which, they said, she had undergone.</P>
<P>Pipes was not well pleased when he found him∣self
disappointed in the expectation of seeing her
in the attitude to which she had been in council
decreed; and Hatchway, though he pretended to
acquiesce in their account, saw through the pre∣tence,
and ascribed their long stay to the true
motive.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine has an interview with his sister Julia.
Is interrupted and attacked by his mother, and
relieved by his friend Gauntlet. Julia is settled
in the garison, and Trunnion affronted by his
old friend Gamaliel Pickle.</HEAD>
<P>TWO days after this atchievement was so
happily accomplished, our here received
an intimation from his sister, that she should be
overjoyed to meet him next day, at five o'clock
in the afternoon, at the house of her nurse, who
lived in a cottage hard by her father's habitation,
she being debarred from all opportunity of seeing
him in any other place by the severity of her mo∣ther,
who suspected her inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="274"/>
He accordingly obeyed the summons, and went
at the time appointed to the place of rendezvous,
where he met this affectionate young lady, who
when he entered the room, ran towards him with
ail the eagerness of transport; flung her arms
about his neck, and shed a flood of tears in his
bosom before she could utter one word, except a
repetition of my dear, dear brother! He em∣braced
her with all the piety of fraternal tender∣ness,
wept over her in his turn, assured her that
this was one of the happiest moments of his life,
and kindly thanked her for having resisted the
example, and disobeyed the injunctions of his
mother's unnatural aversion.</P>
<P>He was ravished to find by her conversation,
that she possessed a great share of sensibility and
prudent reflexion; for she lamented the insatua∣tion
of her parents with the most filial regret, and
expressed such abhorrence and concern at the vil∣lainous
disposition of her younger brother, as a
humane sister may be supposed to have enter∣tained.
He made her acquainted with all the cir∣cumstances
of his own fortune, and as he sup∣posed
she spent her time very disagreeably at
home, among characters which must be shock∣ingly
interesting, professed a desire of moving her
into some other sphere, where she could live with
more tranquillity and satisfaction.</P>
<P>She objected to this proposal as an expedient
that would infallibly subject her to implaca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
resentment of her mother, whose favour and af∣fection
she at present enjoyed but in a very in∣considerable
degree; and they had canvassed di∣vers
schemes of corresponding for the future when
the voice of Mrs. Pickle was heard at the door.</P>
<P>Miss Julv (that was the young lady's name)
finding herself betrayed, was seized with a vio∣lent
<PB N="267" REF="275"/>
agitation of fear, and Peregrine scarce had
time to encourage her with a promise of protec∣tion▪
before the door of the apartment being flung
open, this irreconcileable parent rushed in, and
with a furious aspect flew directly at her trem∣bling
daughter, when the son interposing, re∣ceived
the first discharge of her fury.</P>
<P>Her eyes gleamed with all the rage of indigna∣tion,
which choaked up her utterance, and seemed
to convulse her whole frame; she twisted her left
hand in his hair, and with the other buffeted him
about the face, till the blood gushed from his no∣strils
and mouth; while he defended his sister
from the cruelty of Gam, who assaulted her
from another quarter, seeing his brother en∣gaged.
This attack lasted several minutes with
great violence, till at length Peregrine finding
himself in danger of being overpowered, if he
should remain any longer on the defensive, laid
his brother on his back; and before he could get
up again, disentangled his mother's hand from his
own hair, and having pushed her gently out of
the room, bolted the door on the inside; then
turning to Gam, threw him out at the window,
among a parcel of hogs that fed under it. By
this time, Julia was almost quite distracted with
terror; she knew she had offended beyond all
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe of forgiveness, and from that moment con∣sidered
herself as an exile from her father's house;
in vain did her brother strive to console her with
fresh protestations of love and protection, she
counted herself extremely miserable in being
obliged to endure the eternal resentment of a pa∣rent
with whom she had hitherto lived, and
dreaded the censure of the world, which from
her mother's misrepresentation she was sensible
would condemn her unheard. That she might not
<PB N="268" REF="276"/>
however neglect any means in her power of a∣verting
this storm, she resolved to appease, if pos∣sible,
her mother's wrath with humiliation, and
even appeal to the influence of her father, weak
as it was, before she would despair of being for∣given.
But the good lady spared her this unne∣cessary
application, by telling her through the
key-hole, that she must never expect to come
within her father's door again; for from that hour
she renounced her as unworthy of her affection
and regard. Julia weeping bitterly, endeavoured
to soften the rigour of this sentence, by the most
submissive and reasonable remonstrances; but as in
her vindication she of necessity espoused her elder
brother's cause, her endeavours instead of soothing,
served only to exasperate her mother to an higher
pitch of indignation, which discharged itself in in∣vectives
against Peregrine, whom she reviled with
the epithets of worthless abandoned reprobate.</P>
<P>The youth hearing these unjust aspersions,
trembled with resentment through every limb,
assuring the upbraider that he considered her as an
object of compassion; “for without all doubt,
said he, your diabolic rancour must be severely
punished by the thorns of your own conscience,
which this very instant taxes you with the malice
and falsehood of your reproaches. As for my
sister, I bless God that you have not been able to
infect her with your unnatural prejudice, which
because she is too just, too virtuous, too humane
to imbibe, you reject her as an alien to your
blood, and turn her out unprovided into a bar∣barous
world. But even there your vitious pur∣pose
shall be defeated; that same providence that
screened me from the cruelty of your hate shall ex∣tend
its protection to her, until I shall find it con∣venient
to assert by law that right of maintenance
<PB N="269" REF="277"/>
which nature, it seems, hath bestowed upon us in
vain. In the mean time, you will enjoy the satis∣faction
of paying an undivided attention to that dar∣ling
son, whose amiable qualities have so long en∣gaged
and engrossed your love and esteem.”</P>
<P>This freedom of expostulation exalted his
mother's ire to meer frenzy; she cursed him with
the bitterest imprecations, and raved like a Bed∣lamite
at the door, which she attempted to burst
open. Her efforts were seconded by her favourite
son, who denounced vengeance against Peregrine,
made furious assaults against the lock, which re∣sisted
all their applications, until our hero espying
his friend Gauntlet and Pipes stepping over a
style that stood about a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urlong from the window,
called them to his assistance; and giving them to
understand how he was besieged, desired they
would keep off his mother, that he might the
more easily secure his sister Julia's retreat. The
young soldier entered accordingly, and posting
himself between Mrs. Pickle and door, gave
the signal to his friend, who lifting up his sister
in his arms, carried her safe without the clutches
of this she-dragon, while Pipes with his cudgel
kept young master at bay.</P>
<P>The mother being thus deprived of her prey,
sprung upon Gauntlet like a lioness robbed of her
whelps, and he must have suffered sorely in the
flesh, had he not prevented her mischievous in∣tent
by seizing both her wrists, and so keeping
her at due distance. In attempting to disengage
herself from his grasp, she struggled with such
exertion, and suffered such agony of passion at
the same time, that she actually fell into a severe
fit, during which she was put to bed, and the
confederates retired without further molestation.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="278"/>
In the mean time, Peregrine was not a little
perplexed about the disposal of his sister whom he
had rescued. He could not endure the thoughts
of saddling the commodore with a new expence;
and he was afraid of undertaking the charge of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, without his benefactor's advice and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣tion:
for the present, however, he carried her
to the house of a gentleman in the neighbour∣hood,
whose lady was her godmother, where she
was received with great tenderness and conde∣lance;
and he proposed to inquire for some credi∣table
house▪ where she might be gent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elly boarded
in his a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sence▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to maintain her from the
savi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of his o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h allowance which he thought
might very well bear such deduction. But this
intention was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rustrated by the publication of the
whole affair, which was divulged next day, and
soon reached the ears of Trunnion, who chid
his godson for having concealed the adventure;
and, with the approbation of his wife, ordered
him to bring Julia forthwith to the garison. The
young gentleman, with tears of gratitude in his
eyes, explained his design of maintaining her at
his own expence, and earnestly begged that he
might not be deprived of that satisfaction. But
his uncle was deaf to all his intreaties, and in∣sisted
upon her living in the garison, though for
no other reason than that of being company to
her aunt, who, he observed, was lost for want
of conversation.</P>
<P>Julia was accordingly brought home, and set∣led
under the tuition of Mrs. Trunnion, who,
whatever face she might put on the matter, could
have dispensed with the society of her niece;
though she was not without hope of gratifying
her pique at Mrs. Pickle, by the intelligence she
would receive from the daughter, of that lady's
<PB N="271" REF="279"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>economy and domestic behaviour. The mother
herself seemed conscious of this advantage which
her sister-in-law had now gained over her, being
as much chagrined at the news of Julia's recep∣tion
at the garison, as if she had heard of her
own husband's death. She even tortured her in∣vention
to propagate calumni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s against the repu∣tation
of her own daughter, whom she slandered
in all companies; she exclaimed against the com∣modore
as an old russian who spi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited up a rebel∣lion
among her children, and imputed the hospi∣tality
of his wife, in countenancing them▪ to no∣thing
else but her inveterate enmity to their mo∣ther,
whom they had disobliged. She now in∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed,
in the most peremptory terms, upon her
husband's renouncing all commerce with the old
lad of castle and his adherents; and Mr. Ga∣maliel

to communicate with the commodore one
night, when they happened to meet by accident
at the public house.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The commodore sends a challenge to Gamaliel, and
is imposed upon by a waggish invention of the
lieutenant, Peregrine and Gauntlet.</HEAD>
<P>THIS affront Trunnion could by no means
digest: he advised with the lieutenant upon
the subject; and the result of their consultation was
a defiance which the old commander sent to Pickle,
demanding that he would meet him at such a place
on horseback with a brace of pistols, and give sa∣tisfaction
for the slight he had put upon him.</P>
<P>Nothing could have afforded more pleasure to
J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, than the acceptance of this challenge,
<PB N="272" REF="280"/>
which he delivered verbally to Mr. Gamaliel,
who was called out from the club at Tunley's
for that purpose. The nature of this message
had an instantaneous effect upon the constitution
of the pacific Pickle, whose bowels yearned with
apprehension, and underwent such violent agitation
on the spot, that one would have thought the ope∣ration
proceeded from some severe joke of the apo∣thecary
which he had swallowed in his beer.</P>
<P>The messenger despairing of a satisfactory an∣swer,
left him in this woeful condition; and
being loath to lose any opportunity of raising the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the commodore, went immediately
and communicated the whole affair to the young
gentlemen, intreating them, for the love of God,
to concert some means of bringing old Hannibal
into the field. The two friends relished the pro∣posal,
and after some deliberation, it was resolved
that Hatchway should tell Trunnion his invitation
was accepted by Gamaliel, who would meet him
at the place appointed, with his second, to-mor∣row
in the twilight, because if either should fall,
the other would have the better chance for escaping
in the dark; that Godfrey should personate old
pickle's friend, and Peregrine represent his own
father, while the lieutenant should take care in
loading the pistols to keep out the shot, so as
that no damage might be done in the rencounter.</P>
<P>These circumstances being adjusted, the lieu∣tenant
returned to his principal with a most thun∣dering
reply from his antagonist, whose coura∣geous
behaviour, though it could not intimidate,
did not fail to astonish the commodore, who as∣cribed
it to the spirit of his wife▪ which had in∣spired
him. Trunnion that instant desired his
counsellor to prepare his cartridge-box, and order
the quietest horse in the stable to be kept ready
<PB N="273" REF="281"/>
saddled for the occasion; his eye seemed to lighten
with alacrity and pleasure at the prospect of smell∣ing
gun-powder once more before his death; and
when Jack advised him to make his will, in case
of accident, he rejected his counsel with disdain,
saying, “What! dost think that Hawser Trun∣nion,
who has stood the fire of so many floating
batteries, runs any risk from the lousy pops of a
land-man? Thou shalt see, thou shalt see how
I will make him lower his top-sails.” Next day
Peregrine and the soldier provided themselves with
horses at the public house, from whence, at the
destined hour, they rode to the field of battle,
each of them being muffled in a great coat, which,
with the dimness of the light, effectually shielded
them from the knowledge of the one-eyed com∣mander,
who having taken horse, on pretence of
enjoying the fresh air, soon appeared with Hatch∣way
in his rear. When they came within sight
of each other, the seconds advanced, in order to
divide the ground, and regulate the measures of
the combat; when it was determined by mutual
consent, that two pistols should be discharged on
each side, and that if neither should prove deci∣sive,
recourse must be had to the broad-swords,
in order to ascertain the victory. These articles
being settled, the opponents rode forward to their
respective stations, when Peregrine cocking his
pistol, and presenting, counterfeited his father's
voice, and bad Trunnion take care of his re∣maining
eye. The commodore took his advice,
being unwilling to hazard his day-light, and very
deliberately opposed the patched side of his face
to the muzzle of his antagonist's piece, desiring
him to do his duty without further jaw. The
young man accordingly fired, and the distance be∣ing
small, the wad of his pistol took place with a
<PB N="274" REF="282"/>
smart stroke on the forehead of Trunnion, who
mistaking it for the ball, which he thought was
lodged in his brain, spurred up his steed in a state
of desperation towards his antagonist, and holding
his piece within two yards of his body, let it off,
without any regard to the laws of battle. Sur∣prised
and enraged to see it had made no impres∣sion,
he hollowed in a terrible tone, “O! damn
ye, you have got your netting stuffed, I sec;”
and advancing, discharged his second pistol so near
his godson's head, that had he not been defended
by his great coat, the powder must have scorched
his face. Having thus thrown away his fire, he
remained at the mercy of Peregrine, who clap∣ping
the piece he had in reserve to his head,
commanded him to beg his life, and ask pardon
for his presumption. The commodore made no
reply to this imperious injunction, but dropping
his pistol, and unsheathing his broad-sword with
a j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, attacked our hero with such incredible agi∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty,
that if he had not made shift to ward off the
stroke with his piece, the adventure, in all like∣lihood,
would have turned out a very tragical
joke. Peregrine finding it would bein vain for
him to think of drawing his weapon, and stading
on the defensive against this furious aggressor,
very fairly cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt spurs to his nag, and sougt his
safety in flight. Trunnion pursued him with in∣finite
eagerness, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being the better of
the two, would have overtaken the fugitive to
his peril, had he not been unfortunately encoun∣tered
by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a tree that happened to
stand on his blind side, and incomm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded him so
much, that he was fain to quit his sword, and
lay hold on the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne, in order to maintain his
seat. Perry perceiving his disaster, wheeled about,
and now finding leisure to produce his weapon,
<PB N="275" REF="283"/>
returned upon his disarmed foe, and brandishing
his Ferrara, threatened to make him shorter by
the head, if he would not immediately crave
quarter, and yield. There was nothing farther
from the intention of the old gentleman than such
submission, which he flatly refused to pay, alledging
that he had already compelled his enemy to clap
on all his sails, and that his own present misfor∣tune
was owing to accident, all one as if a ship
should be attacked, after she had been obliged to
heave her guns over-board in a storm.</P>
<P>Before Peregrine had time to answer this re∣monstrance,
the lieutenant interposed, and taking
cognizance of the case, established a truce, until
he and the other second should discuss and decide
upon the merits of the cause. They accordingly
retired to a small distance, and after having con∣ferred
a few minutes, Hatchway returned, and
pronounced the commodore vanquished by the
chance of war.</P>
<P>Never was rage more transporting than that
which took possession of old Hannibal, when he
heard the sentence; it was some time before he
could utter aught, except the reproachful expres∣sion,
<HI>You lie!</HI> which he repeated more than twenty
times, in a sort of delirious insensibility; and when
he recovered the further use of speech, abused the
arbitrators with such bitter invectives, renouncing
their sentence, and appealing to another trial, that
the confederates began to repent of having carried
the joke so far; and Peregrine, in order to appease
his choler, owned himself overcome.</P>
<P>This acknowledgement calmed the tumult of
his wrath, though he could not for some days
forgive the lieutenant; and the two young gen∣tlemen
rode back to Tunley's while Hatchway,
taking the commodore's horse by the bridle, re∣conducted
<PB N="276" REF="284"/>
him to his mansion, growling all the
way at Jack for his unjust and unfriendly decree;
though he could not help observing, as how he
had made his words good, in making his adver∣sary
strike his top-sails: “And yet (said he) be∣fore
God! I think the fellow's head is made of a
wool-pack; for my shot rebounded from his face
like a wad of spun-yarn from the walls of a ship.
But if so be that son of a bitch of a tree hadn't
come athwart my weather-bow, d'ye see, I'll
be damned if I hadn't snapt his main-yard in the
slings, and mayhap let out his bulge water into
the bargain.” He seemed particularly vain of
this exploit, which dwelt upon his imagination,
and was cherished as the child of his old age; for
though he could not with decency rehearse it to the
young men and his wife at supper, he gave shrewd
hints of his own manhood, even at these years, and
attested Hatchway as a voucher for his mettle,
while the triumvirate, diverted by his vanity, en∣joyed
in secret the success of their imposition.</P>

<P>THIS, however, was the last effort of in∣vention
which they practised upon him;
and every thing being now prepared for the de∣parture
of his godson, that hopeful youth in two
days took leave of all his friends in the neigh∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urhood,

to a morsel of bread, laid strict injunctions upon
him, to live in the fear of the Lord and the true

to treat Mr. Jolter with reverence and re∣gard,
and above all things to abstain from the
beastly sin of drunkenness, which exposeth a
man to the scorn and contempt of his fellow∣creatures,
and by divesting him of reason and re∣flection,
renders him fit for all manner of vice
and debauchery. She recommended to him oeco∣nomy
and the care of his health, bad him re∣member
the hounour of his family, and in all the
circumstances of his behaviour, assured him, that
he might always depend upon the friendship and
generosity of the commodore; and finally, pre∣senting
him with her own picture set in gold,
and an hundred guineas from her privy purse,
embraced him affectionately, and wished him all
manner of happiness and prosperity.</P>
<P>Being thus kindly dismissed by Mrs. Trunnion,
he locked himself up with his sister Julia, whom
he admonished to cultivate her aunt with the most
complaisant and respectful attention, without
stooping to any circumstance of submission that
she should judge unworthy of her practice; he
protested, that his chief study should be to make
her amends for the privilege she had forfeited
by her affection for him; intreated her to enter
into no engagement without his knowledge and
approbation, put into her hand the purse which
he had received from his aunt, to defray her
packet expences in his absence, and parted from
her, not without tears, after she had for some
minutes hung about his neck, kissing him and
weeping in the most pathetic silence.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="286"/>
Having performed these duties of affection and
consanguinity over-night, he went to bed, and
was by his own direction, called at four o'clock
in the morning, when he found the post-chaise,
coach and riding-horses ready at the gate, his
friends Gauntlet and Hatchway on foot, the com∣modore
himself almost dressed, and every servant
in the garison assembled in the yard, to wish him
a good journey. Our hero shook each of these
humble friends by the hand, tipping them at the
same time with marks of his bounty; and was
very much surprized when he could not perceive
his old attendant Pipes among the number. When
he expressed his wonder at this disrespectful omis∣sion
of Tom, some of those present ran to his
chamber, in order to give him a call, but his
hammock and room were both deserted,and they
soon returned with an account of his having eloped.
Peregrine was disturbed at this information, be∣lieving
that the fellow had taken some desperate
course, in consequence of his being dismissed from
his service, and began to wish that he had indulged
his inclination, by retaining him still about his
person. However, as there was now no other
remedy, he recommended him strenuously to the
particular favour and distinction of his uncle and
Hatchway, in case he should appear again; and
as he went out at the gate, was saluted with three
chears by all the domestics in the family. The
commodore, Gauntlet, lieutenant, Peregrine and
Jolter went into the coach together, that they
might enjoy each other's conversation as much as
possible, resolving to breakfast at an inn upon the
road, where Trunnion and Hatchway intended
to bid our adventurer sarewel; the valet de cham∣bre
got into the post-chaise, the French lacquey
rode one horse and led another, one of the valets
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>
of the garison mounted at the back of the coach;
and thus the cavalcade set out on the road to Do∣ver.
As the commodore could not bear the fa∣tigue
of jolting, they travelled at an easy pace
during the first stage; so that the old gentleman
had an opportunity of communicating his exhor∣tations
to his godson, with regard to his conduct
abroad; he advised him, now that he was going
into foreign parts, to be upon his guard against
the fair weather of the French politesse, which
was no more to be trusted than a whirlpool at sea.
He observed that many young men had gone to
Paris with good cargoes of sense, and returned
with a great deal of canvas, and no ballast at all,
whereby they became crank all the days of their
lives, and sometimes carried their keels above wa∣ter.
He desired Mr. Jolter to keep his pupil out
of the clutches of those sharking priests who lie in
wait to make converts of all young strangers, and
in a particular manner cautioned the youth against
carnal conversation with the Parisian dames, who,
he understood, were no better than gaudy fire-ships
ready primed with death and destruction.</P>
<P>Peregrine listened with great respect, thanking
him for his kind admonitions, which he faithfully
promised to observe. They halted and breakfasted at
the end of the stage, where Jolter provided himself
with a horse, and the commodore settled the me∣thod
of corresponding with his nephew; and the
minute of parting being arrived, the old comman∣der
wrung his godson by the hand, saying, “I
with thee a prosperous voyage and good cheer,
my lad; my timbers are now a little crazy, d'ye
see; and God knows if I shall keep afloat till
such time as I see thee again; but, howsomever,
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p what will, thou wilt find thyself in a condi∣tion
to keep in the line with the best of thy fol∣lows.”;
<PB N="280" REF="288"/>
He then reminded Gauntlet of his pro∣mise
to call at the garison in his return from Do∣ver,
and imparted something in a whisper to the
governor, while Jack Hatchway unable to speak,
pulled his hat over his eyes, and squeezing Pere∣grine
by the hand, gave him an iron pistol of cu∣rious
workmanship, as a memorial of his friend∣ship.
Our youth, who was not unmoved on this
occasion, received the pledge, which he acknow∣ledged
with the present of a silver tobacco-box,
that he had bought for that purpose; and the two
lads of the castle getting into the coach, were
driven homewards, in a state of silent dejection.</P>
<P>Godfrey and Peregrine seated themselves in the
post-chaise, and Jolter, the valet de chambre and
lacquey bestriding their beasts, they proceeded for
the place of their destination, at which they arrived
in safety that same night, and bespoke a passage
in the pacqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t-boat which was to sail next day.</P>

<P>THERE the two friends adjusted the arti∣cles

Peregrine having written a letter to his mistress,
wherein he renewed his former vows of eternal
fidelity, it was intrusted to the care of her bro∣ther,
while Mr. Jolter, at the desire of his pupil,
provided an elegant supper, and some excellent
Burgundy, that they might spend this eve of his

<P>Things being thus disposed,and a servant em∣ployed

<PB N="281" REF="289"/>
sudden invaded by a strange tumultuous noise in
the next room, occasioned by the overthrow of
tables, chairs and glasses, with odd unintelligible
exclamations in broken French, and a jargon of
threats in the Welsh dialect. Our young gentle∣men
ran immediately into the apartment from
whence this clamour seemed to proceed, and
found a thin meager swarthy figure gasping in all
the agony of fear, under the hands of a squat,
thick, hard-featured man, who collared him with
great demonstrations of wrath, saying, “If you
was as mighty a magician as Owen Glendower,
or the witch of Entor, look you, ay, or as Paul
Beor himself, I will make pole, by the assistance
of Got, and in his Majesty's naam, to seize and
secure, and confine and confront you, until such
time as you suffer and endure and undergo the pains
and penalties of the law, for your diabolical prac∣tices.
Shentlemens, added he, turning to our ad∣venturers,
I take you to witness that I protest and
assert and avow that this person is as pig a necro∣mancer
as you would desire to behold; and I sup∣plicate
and beseech and intreat of you, that he may
be prought pefore his petters, and compelled to
give an account of his compact and commerce with
the imps of darkness, look you; for as I am a
christian soul, and hope for joyful resurrection,
I have this plessed evening seen him perform such
things as could not be done without the aid and
instruction and connivance of the Tevil.”</P>
<P>Gauntlet seemed to enter into the sentiments
of this Welch reformer, and actually laid hold
on the delinquent's shoulder, crying, “Damn
the rascal! I'll lay any wager that he's a jesuit;
for none of his order travel without a familiar.”
But Peregrine, who looked upon the affair in
another point of view, interposed in behalf of
<PB N="282" REF="290"/>
the stranger, whom he freed from his aggressors,
observing that there was no occasion to use vio∣lence,
and asked in French what he had done to
incur the censure of the informer. The poor fo∣reigner,
more dead than alive, answered that he
was an Italian charlatan, who had practised with
some reputation in Padua. until he had the mis∣fortune
to attract the notice of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nquisition, by
exhibiting certain wonderful performances by his
skill in natural knowledge, which that tribunal
considered as the effects of sorcery, and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted
him accordingly; so that he had been fain
to make a precipitate retreat into France, where
not finding his account in his talents, he was
now arrived in England, with a view of prac∣tising
his art in London; and that in consequence
of a specimen which he had given to a company
below, the choleric gentleman had followed him
up stairs to his own apartment, and assaulted him
in that inhospitable manner. He therefore ear∣nestly
begged that our hero would take him under
his protection; and if he entertained the least
suspicion of his employing preternatural means in
the operations of his art, he would freely commu∣nicate
all the secrets in his possession.</P>
<P>The youth dispelled his apprehension, by as∣suring
him that he was in no danger of suffer∣ing
for his art in England, where, if ever he
should be questioned by the zeal of superstitious
individuals, he had nothing to do but appeal to
the next justice of the peace, who would imme∣diately
acquit him of the charge, and punish his
accusers for their impertinence and indiscretion.</P>
<P>He then told Gauntlet and the Welshman, that
the stranger had a good action against them for
an assault, by virtue of an act of parliament,
which makes it criminal for any person to accuse
<PB N="283" REF="291"/>
another of sorcery and witchcraft, these idle no∣tions
being now justly exploded by all sensible
men. Mr. Jolter, who had by this time joined
the company, could not help signif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing his dissent
from this opinion of his pupil, which he endea∣voured
to invalidate by the authority of scripture,
quotations from the father, and the confession of
many wretches who suffered death for having car∣ried
on correspondence with evil spirits, together
with the evidence of Satan's Invisible World,
and Moreton's history of witchcraft.</P>
<P>The soldier corroborated these testimonies by
facts that had happened within the sphere of his
own knowledge, and in particular mentioned the
case of an old woman of the parish in which he
was born, who used to transform herself into the
shapes of sundry animals, and was at last killed
by small-shot, in the character of an hare. The
Welchman thus supported, expressed his surprize
at hearing that the legislature had shewn such
tenderness for criminals of so dark a hue; and
offered to prove by undeniable instances, that
there was not a mountain in Wales, which had
not been in his memory the scene of necromancy
and witchcraft; “Wherefore, said he, I am as∣suredly
more than apove astonished and con∣founded
and concerned, that the parliament of
Great Pritain should in their great wisdoms and
their prudence, and their penetration, give coun∣tenance
and encouragement, look you, to the
works of darkness and the empire of Polzepup;
ofer and apove the evidence of holy writ, and
those writers who have been quoted by that aggu∣rate
and learned shentleman, we are informed
by profane history, of the pribbles and pranks of
the old serpent, in the bortents and oragles of an∣tiquity;
as you will find in that most excellent
<PB N="284" REF="292"/>
historian Bolypius, and Titus Lifius; ay, and
moreofer, in the commentaries of Julius Caesar
himself, who, as the ole 'orld knows, was a most
famous, and a most faliant, and a most wise, and
a most prudent, and a most fortunate cheistan,
and a most renowned orator; ay, and a most
elegant writer to boot.”</P>
<P>Peregrine did not think proper to enter the
lists of dispute with three such obstinate antago∣nists;
but contented himself with saying, that he
believed it would be no difficult matter to im∣pugn
the arguments they had advanced; though
he did not find himself at all disposed to under∣take
the task, which must of course break in upon
the evening's entertainment. He therefore invited
the Italian to supper, and asked the same favour
of his accuser, who seemed to have something
curious and characteristic in his manner and dis∣position,
resolving to make himself an eye-wit∣ness
of those surprising feats, which had given
offence to the choleric Briton. This scrupulous
gentleman thanked our hero for his courtesy, but
declined communicating with the stranger, until
his character should be further explained; upon
which his inviter, after some conversation with the
charlatan, assured him that he would himself under∣take
for the innocence of his art; and then he was
prevailed upon to favour them with his company.</P>
<P>In the course of the conversation, Peregrine
learnt that the Welchman was a surgeon of
Canterbury, who had been called in to a consul∣tation
at Dover, and understanding that his name
was Morgan, took the liberty of asking if he was
not the person so respectfully mentioned in the
Adventures of Roderick Random. Mr. Morgan
assumed a look of gravity and importance at this
interrogation, and screwing up his mouth, an∣swered,
<PB N="285" REF="293"/>
“Mr. Rantum, my goot sir, I believe
upon my conscience and salfation, is my very
goot frient and wellwisher; and he and I have
been companions and messmates and fellow-suf∣ferers,
look you; but nevertheless, for all that,
peradventure, he hath not pehaved with so much
complaisance and affability and respect, as I might
have expected from him; pecause he hath re∣vealed
and tivulged and buplished our private af∣fairs,
without my knowledge and privity and con∣sent;
but as Got is my safiour, I think he had
no evil intention in his pelly; and though there
be certain persons, look you, who, as I am told,
take upon them to laugh at his descriptions of my
person, deportment and conversation, I do af∣firm
and maintain, and insist with my heart, and
my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood and my soul, that those persons are no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter than ignorant asses, and that they know
not how to discern and distinguish and define true
ridicule, or as Aristotle calls it, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, no
more, look you, than a herd of mountain goats;
for I will make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old to observe, and I hope this
goot company will be of the same opinion , that
there is nothing said of me in that performance,
which is unworthy of a christian and a shentleman.”</P>
<P>Our young gentleman and his friends acquies∣ced
in the justness of his observation, and Pere∣grine
particularly assured him, that from reading
the book, he had conceived the utmost regard
and veneration for his character; and that he
thought himself extremely fortunate in having
this opportunity of enjoying his conversation.
Morgan, not a little proud of such advances from
a person of Peregrine's appearance, returned the
compliment with a profusion of civility, and in
the warmth of acknowledgement, expressed a
desire of seeing him and his company at his house
<PB N="286" REF="294"/>
in Canterbury: “I will not pretend, or presume,
kind sir, said he, to entertain you according to
your merits and deserts; but you shall be as wel∣come
to my poor cottage, and my wife and fa∣mily,
as the Prince of Wales himself; and it
shall go hard, if one way or other, I do not find
ways and means of making you con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess that there
is some goot fellowship in an ancient Priton: for
though I am no petter than a simple apothecary,
I have as goot <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lood circulating in my veins, as
any he in the county; and I can describe and

to treat my friend with a joint of goot mut∣ton,
and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottle of excellent wine, and no
tradesman can peard me with a bill.” He was
congratulated on his happy situation, and assured
that our youth would visit him on his return from
France, provided he should take Canterbury in
his route; and as Peregrine manifested an inclina∣tion
of being acquainted with the state of his af∣fairs,
he very complaisantly satisfied his curiosity,
by giving him to know that his spouse had left off
breeding, after having blessed him with two boys
and a girl, who were still alive and well; that he
lived in good esteem with his neighbours, and by
his practice, which was considerably extended
immediately after the publication of Roderick
Random, had saved some thousand pounds, and
begun to think of retiring among his own rela∣tions
in Glamorganshire, where he had already
pitched upon a spot for his residence, though his
wife had made objections to this proposal, and
opposed the execution of it with such obstinacy,
that he had been at infinite pains in asserting his
own prerogative, by convincing her both from
<PB N="287" REF="295"/>
reason and example, that he was king and priest
in his own family, and that she owed the most
implicit submission to his will: he likewise in∣formed
the company, that he had lately seen his
friend Roderick, who had come from London on
purpose to visit him, after having gained his law∣suit
with Mr. Topehall, who was obliged to pay
Narcissa's fortune; that Mr. Random, in all ap∣pearance,
led a very happy life in the conversa∣tion
of his father and bedfellow, by whom he
enjoyed a son and daughter; and that Morgan
had received in a present from him, a piece of
very fine linnen of his wife's own making, seve∣ral
kits of salmon, and two casks of pickled pork,
the most delicate he had ever tasted; together
with a barrel of excellent herrings for salmagundy,
which he knew to be his favourite dish.</P>
<P>This topick of conversation being discussed, the
Italian was desired to exhibit a specimen of his
art, and in a few minutes conducted the company
into the next room, where to their great astonish∣ment
and affright, they beheld a thousand ser∣pents
winding along the cieling. Morgan struck
with this phaenomenon, which he had not seen
before, began to utter exorcisms with great devo∣tion,
Mr. Jolter ran terrified out of the room,
Gauntlet drew his hanger, and Peregrine himself
was disconcerted. The operator perceiving their
confusion, desired them to retire, and calling
them back in an instant, there was not a viper to
be seen. He raised their admiration by sundry
other performances, and the Welchman's former
opinion and abhorrence of his character began
to recur, when in consideration of the civility
with which he had been treated, this Italian im∣parted
to them all the methods by which he had
acted such wonders, that were no other than the
<PB N="288" REF="296"/>
effects of natural causes curiously combined; so
that Morgan became a convert to his skill, asked
pardon for the suspicion he had entertained, and
invited the stranger to pass a few days with him
at Canterbury. The scruples of Godfrey and Jol∣ter
were removed at the same time, and Pere∣grine
testified his satisfaction by an handsome gra∣tuity
which he bestowed upon their entertainer.</P>
<P>The evening being spent in this sociable man∣ner,
every man retired to his respective chamber,
and next morning they breakfasted together, when
Morgan declared he would stay till he should see
our hero fairly embarked, that he might have the
pleasure of Mr. Gauntlet's company to his own
habitation; mean while, by the skipper's advice,
the servants were ordered to carry a store of wine
and provision on board in case of accident; and
as the packet-boat could not sail before one
o'clock, the company walked up hill to visit the
castle, where they saw the sword of Julius Caesar
and Queen Elizabeth's pocket pistol, repeated
Shakespear's description, while they surveyed the
chalky cliffs on each side, and cast their eyes to∣wards
the city of Calais, that was obscured by a
thick cloud which did not much regale their eye∣sight,
because it seemed to portend foul weather.</P>
<P>Having viewed every thing remarkable in this
place, they returned to the pier, where after the
compliments of parting, and an affectionate em∣brace
between the two young gentlemen, Pere∣grine
and his governor stept on board, the sails
were hoisted, and they went to sea with a fair
wind, while Godfrey, Morgan and the conjurer
walked back to the inn, from whence they set
out for Canterbury before dinner.</P>
