<P>THE PATRON. A COMEDY IN THREE ACTS. As it is Performed at the THEATRE in the HAY-MARKET. By SAMUEL FOOTE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>
<P>LONDON, Printed for G. KEARSLY, in Ludgate-street. MDCCLXIV.</P>

<PB REF="2"/>
<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE Granville Leveson Gower, Earl Gower, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following little comedy, found∣ed on a story of M. Marmontelle's, and calculated to expose the frivolity and ignorance of the pretenders to learn∣ing, with the insolence and vanity of their superficial, illiberal protectors, can be ad∣dressed to no nobleman with more propri∣ety than to Lord Gower; whose judgment, though elegant, is void of affectation; and whose patronage, though powerful, is de∣stitute of all fastidious parade. It is with pleasure, my Lord, that the public sees your Lordship plac'd at the head of that depart∣ment which is to decide, without appeal,
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
on the most popular domain in the whole republic of letters; a spot that has always been distinguish'd with affection, and cul∣tivated with care, by every ruler the least attentive to either chastising the morals, polishing the manners, or what is of equal importance, rationally amusing the leisure of the people.</P>
<P>The Patron, my Lord, who now begs your protection, has had the good fortune to be well receiv'd by the public; and in∣deed, of all the pieces that I have had the honour to offer them, this seems to me to have the fairest claim to their favour.</P>
<P>But the play, stripped of those theatrical ornaments for which it is indebted to your Lordship's indulgence, must now plead it's own cause; nor will I, my Lord, with an affected humility, echo the trite, coarse, though classical compliment, of Optimus patronus pessimus poeta: For if this be really true of the last, the first can have but small pretensions to praise; patronizing bad poets being, in my poor opinion, full as pernicious to the progress of letters, as neglecting the good.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="4"/>In humble hopes, then, my Lord, of not being thought the meanest in the muses train, I have taken the liberty to prefix your name to this dedication, and publickly to acknowlege my obligations to your lordship; which, let me boast too, I have had the happiness to receive, untaint∣ed by the insolence of domestics, the de∣lays of office, or the chilling superiority of rank; mortifications which have been too often experienced by much greater writers than myself, from much less men than your Lordship.</P>
<P>My Lord, I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect and gratitude,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Lordship's most oblig'd, and most devoted, humble servant, SAMUEL FOOTE.</SIGNED>

<P>At rather too great an expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a fellow of your observation and turn, I should think now such a scene a most delicate treat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delicate! Palling, nauseous, to a dread∣ful degree. To a lover, indeed, the charms of the niece may palliate the uncle's ful∣some formality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The uncle! ay, but then you know he is only one of the group.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; but the figures are all finish'd alike. A maniere, a tiresome same∣ness throughout.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you will excuse me; I am sure there is no want of variety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! then let us have a detail. Come, Dick, give us a bill of the play.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, you know, there's Juliet's uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir Thomas Lofty! the modern Midas, or rather (as fifty dedications will
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
tell you) the Pollio, the Atticus, the pa∣tron of genius, the protector of arts, the paragon of poets, decider on merit, chief justice of taste, and sworn appraiser to Apollo and the tuneful nine. Ha, ha. Oh, the tedious, insipid, insufferable coxcomb!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now, Frank, you are too extrava∣gant. He is universally allow'd to have taste; sharp-judging Adriel, the muse's friend, himself a muse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Taste! by who? underling bards, that he feeds; and broken booksellers, that he bribes. Look ye, Dick, what raptures you please, when Miss Lofty is your theme, but expect no quarter for the rest of the family. I tell thee once for all, Lofty is a rank impostor, the bufo of an illiberal mer∣cenary tribe; he has neither genius to cre∣ate, judgment to distinguish, or generosity to reward; his wealth has gain'd him flat∣tery from the indigent, and the haughty insolence of his pretence, admiration from the ignorant. Voila lè portrait de votre uncle. Now on to the next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The ingenious and erudite Mr. Rust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, old Martin, the medal-monger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same, and my rival in Juliet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rival! what, Rust? why she's too mo∣dern for him by a couple of centuries. Martin! why he likes no heads but upon coins. Marry'd! the mummy! Why 'tis not above a fortnight ago that I saw him making love to the figure without a nose, in Somerset-Gardens: I caught him stroak∣ing the marble plaits of her gown, and asked him if he was not ashamed to take such liberties with ladies in public.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What an inconstant old scoundrel it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a Dorimant. But how came this about? what could occasion the change? was it in the power of flesh and blood to seduce this adorer of virtù from his marble and porphyry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Juliet has done it; and what will sur∣prize you, his taste was a bawd to the business.</P>

<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prythee explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Juliet met him last week at her uncle's: he was a little pleased with the Greek of her profile; but on a closer enquiry, he found the turn-up of her nose too exactly resemble the bust of the princess Popaea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The chaste moiety of the amiable Nero.</P>

<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the deuce! then your business was done in an instant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately. In favour of the tip, he offered chart blanche for the rest of the figure, which (as you may suppose) was instantly caught at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless. But who have we here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of Lofty's companions, a West-Indian of an over-grown fortune. He saves me the trouble of a portrait. This is Sir Peter Pepperpot.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Careless scoundrels! harkee, rascals! I'll banish you home, you dogs! you shall back, and broil in the sun. Mr. Bever, your humble; Sir, I am your entirely de∣voted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem mov'd; what has been the matter, Sir Peter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matter! why I am invited to dinner on a barbicu, and the villains have forgot my bottle of chian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unpardonable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, this country has spoil'd them; this same christening will ruin the colonies.— Well, dear Bever, rare news, boy; our fleet is arriv'd from the West.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, lad; and a glorious cargo of tur∣tle. It was lucky I went to Brighthelm∣stone; I nick'd the time to a hair; thin as
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
a lath, and a stomach as sharp as a shark's: Never was in finer condition for feeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you a large importation, Sir Peter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nine; but seven in excellent order: The captain assures me they greatly gain'd ground on the voyage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you dispose of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four to Cornhill, three to Almack's, and the two sickly ones I shall send to my bo∣rough in Yorkshire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! what, have the provincials a relish for turtle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is amazing how this country im∣proves in turtle and turnpikes; to which (give me leave to say) we, from our part of the world, have not a little contributed. Why formerly, Sir, a brace of bucks on the mayor's annual day was thought a pretty moderate blessing. But we, Sir, have polish'd their palates: Why, Sir, not the meanest member of my corporation but can distinguish the pash from the pee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and sever the green from the shell, with the skill of the ablest anatomist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they are fond of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that the consumption will tell you. The stated allowance is six pounds to an alderman, and five to each of their wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plentiful provision.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there was never known any waste: The mayor, recorder, and rector, are per∣mitted to eat as much as they please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The entertainment is pretty expensive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Land-carriage and all. But I contriv'd to smuggle the last that I sent them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Smuggle! I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, the rascally coachman had always charged me five pounds for the car∣riage. Damn'd dear! Now my cook go∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
at the same time into the country, I made him clap a capuchin upon the tur∣tle, and for thirty shillings put him an in∣side passenger in the Doncaster Fly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>A happy expedient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir Peter has infinite humour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but the frolick had like to have prov'd fatal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The maid at the Rummer at Hatfield popp'd her head into the coach to know if the company would have any breakfast: Ecod, the turtle, Sir, laid hold of her nose, and flapp'd her face with his fins, till the poor devil fell into a fit. Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>YOUNGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, an absolute Rabelais.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, I reckon, Sir Peter, you are go∣ing to the Square?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I extremely admire Sir Thomas: You know this is his day of assembly; I
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
suppose you will be there: I can tell you, you are a wonderful favourite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BEVER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Am I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir PETER.</SPEAKER>
<P>He says, your natural genius is fine; and when polish'd by his cultivation will surprize and astonish the world.</P>

<P>Poetic, but true. Now only conceive, Sir Peter, such a plantation of perfections to be devoured by that caterpillar Rust.</P>

<P>Why, let him give them warning as soon as he can. A pretty sort of service, indeed! where there are neither wages nor vails. The muses! And what, I suppose this is the livery they give. Gadzooks, I had rather be a waiter at Ranelagh.</P>

<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine character he gives of his works. No offence! the greatest in the world, Mr. Dactyl. Panegyric and praise! and what will that do with the publick? why who the devil will give money to be told, that Mr. Such-a-one is a wiser or better man than himself? no, no; 'tis quite and clean out of nature. A good sousing satire now, well powder'd with personal pepper, and season'd with the spirit of party; that de∣molishes a conspicuous character, and sinks him below our own level; there, there, we are pleas'd; there we chuckle, and grin, and toss the half-crowns on the counter.</P>

<P>Yes, and so get cropp'd for a libel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cropp'd! ay, and the luckiest thing that can happen to you. Why, I would not give two-pence for an author that is afraid of his ears. Writing, writing is, (as I may say) Mr. Dactyl, a sort of a warfare, where none can be victor that is the least afraid of a scar. Why, zooks, Sir, I ne∣ver got salt to my porridge till I mounted at the Royal Exchange.</P>

<SPEAKER>PUFF.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; that was the making of me. Then my name made a noise in the world. Talk of forked hills, and of Helicon! ro∣mantic and fabulous stuff. The true Casta∣lian stream is a shower of eggs, and a pil∣lory the poet's Parnassus.</P>

<P>Ay, Sir, there lies my greatest misfor∣tune. Had I only those who are alive to contend with, by assiduity, affection, cares, and caresses, I might secure my conquest: though that would be difficult; for I am convinc'd were you, Mr. Rust, put up by Prestage to auction, the Apollo Belvidere would not draw a greater number of bid∣ders.</P>

<P>Why then I will explain myself. It has been said, and I believe with some shadow

of truth, that no man is a hero to his va∣let de chambre; now I am afraid when you and I grow a little more intimate, which I suppose must be the case if you proceed on your plan, you will be horribly disappointed in your high expectations, and soon discover this Juno, this Cleopatra, and princess Popaea, to be as arrant a mor∣tal as madam your mother.</P>

pray all the way for the fall of your play. And, do you hear, if you find the audience too in∣dulgent, inclin'd to be milky, rather than fail, squeeze in a little acid yourself.

<P>He seems pretty certain, Sir.</P>

<P>Indeed, I am passionately fond of the arts, and therefore can't help—did not somebody knock? no. My good girl, will you step, and take care that when any body comes the servants may not be out of the way. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Juliet.</STAGE> Five and thirty minutes past six; by this time the first act must be over: John will be presently here. I think it can't fail; yet there is so much whim and caprice in the public opinion, that—This young man is unknown; they'll give him no credit. I had better have own'd it myself: Re∣putation goes a great way in these matters; people are afraid to find fault; they are cautious in censuring the works of a man who—hush! that's he: no; 'tis only the shutters. After all, I think I have chose the best way; for if it succeeds to the degree I expect, it will be easy to circulate the real name of the author; if it falls, I am conceal'd; my fame suffers no—There he is. <STAGE><HI>Loud knocking.</HI></STAGE> I can't conceive what kept him so long. <STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> JOHN.</STAGE> So, John; well; and—but you have been a monstrous while.</P>

<P>Yes, they were very quiet, indeed, Sir.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir THOMAS.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right, John; very well; your account pleases me much, honest John. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> John.</STAGE> No, I did not expect the first act would produce any prodigious effect. And, after all, the first act is but a mere introduction; just opens the business, the plot, and gives a little insight into the characters; so that if you but engage and interest the house, it is as much as the best writer can flatt—<STAGE><HI>knocking without</HI></STAGE> Gadso! what, Robin already! why the fellow has the feet of a Mercury. <STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Robin.</STAGE> Well, Robin, and what news do you bring?</P>

<P>Impossible! Oh, most likely some drunken disorderly fellows, that were disturbing the house, and interrupting the play; too common a case; the people were right: they deserv'd a re∣buke. Did not you hear them cry, Out, out, out?</P>

<P>For my part, I don't know much of these matters; but a couple of gentlemen near me, who seem'd sagacious enough too, declar'd that it was the vilest stuff they ever had heard, and wonder'd the players would act it.</P>

<P>I remember Kennet, in his Roman Antiqui∣ties, mentions a play of Terence's, Mr. Dac∣tyl, that was terribly treated; but that he at∣tributes to the peoples' fondness for certain funambuli, or rope-dances; but I have not lately heard of any famous tumblers in town; Sir Thomas, have you?</P>
