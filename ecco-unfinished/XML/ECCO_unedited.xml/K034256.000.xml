<HEAD>A CHARGE TO THE GRAND JURY Of the County of MIDDLESEX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Gentlemen of the Grand Inquest,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>T the Opening of the last Session I was led, by a Retrospect on the Transactions of the preceding Month, to give to the Grand Inquest, then attending on this Court, in a Charge, which, as having neither Leisure or Opportunity to prepare myself for any other, was unpremeditated, some general Directions for their Conduct in the Execution of their Office, together with some Information touching the Nature and Extent of their Authority, adapted par∣ticularly to that Crisis.</P>
<P>Whether the like Kind of Necessity yet subsists, I have neither inquired nor am in∣formed: I trust it does not; and that there remain but few of those who were found active in the late daring Outrages, that have not either satisfied the Justice of the Law, or experienced that Clemency which, in all favourable Cases, his Majesty is disposed to extend.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>Nevertheless, while there exists a Possibility that, in Consequence of recent Information, or some other warrantable Ground for Prose∣cution, you may be called to the Exercise of that Power and Authority which the Law has entrusted you with, in the bringing to a legal Trial the Disturbers of the public Peace, I hold it my Duty to give you, that now attend for that Purpose, such Instruction and Advice as I am able, for the faithful and conscientious Discharge of your Office: And to this I think myself the more obliged, by the Consideration that there may be some among you to whom, as never having at∣tended in this Capacity before, such Instruc∣tion and Advice may be necessary.</P>
<P>To all which I add, that this Court being possessed of no Power of controuling your Deliberations, or of rectifying, other than in Matters of Form, any of the Mistakes, Er∣rors, or Imperfections you might innocently fall into, or which might appear on the Face of any of your Presentments, it cannot but be of Importance to the Properties, the Li∣berties, and even the Lives of your fellow Subjects, as also for the Ease and Quiet of your own Minds, and greatly for the Benefit of the Public, that your Judgments should be well informed as to the Nature and Extent, and the Reasons that oblige you to the conscientious Exercise, of your Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>Upon this Ground, and before I proceed to enumerate the several Heads into which the criminal Law of this Country is branch∣ed out, I must inform you, that your Juris∣diction extends to all such Offences as the Law, no less emphatically than truly, declares to be against the King's, or, which is the same, the public Peace.</P>
<P>The Motives to peaceable Conduct, or, in other Words, of Submission to that legal Power, the chief End whereof is the Preser∣vation of Peace and its consequent Blessing Liberty, are of various Kinds; but with the generality of People there is one that human Laws nave ever in View, namely, the Penal∣ties that follow the Violation of public or private Rights; but Penalties have very little Effect on the Mind, they operate only on the Will; and it is a higher Principle than the Dread of Punishment that must dispose Men to be either good Subjects or good Neigh∣bours. By this higher Principle I mean nothing less than that Reverence for legal Government, which, in the Opinion of the Wise and Judicious in all Ages, is but its Due.</P>
<P>I shall not need to trouble you with any of those Notions touching the Origin of civil Government, which have employed the Thoughts and Pens of speculative Politici∣ans: As little do I mean to decide upon that
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
controverted Question, whether the Power of the supreme Magistrate be the Grant of God, or the Gift of the People; and the rather, because there is, in my Apprehen∣sion, a middle Hypothesis that removes all the Difficulties that have hitherto embar∣rassed this subtile Question <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>Touching the Origin of civil Government, there are two Opinions severally maintained by the Writers on that Subject: the one termed the <HI>patriarchal</HI>, which supposes the Right of Dominion to be founded on the express Donation of God, the other called the <HI>popular</HI> Scheme, which supposes the same Right to be the Gift, or to arise from the Consent, of the People. Of the former, Sir <HI>Robert Filmer, Hobbes</HI> of <HI>Malmes∣bury</HI>, and a few others; of the latter, Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>, and, if I remember right, Bishop <HI>Hoadley</HI>, are the Abettors.</P><P>The middle Hypothesis above hinted at is, that the Rights, the Powers, and Privileges of Dominion are from God, but the Choice of the Person who shall exercise them is the Right of the People.</P><P>A late very ingenious Writer, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry Grove</HI>, of <HI>Taunton</HI>, was the first, in his own Opinion, that discovered this Middle Scheme, concerning which he speaks as follows: <Q>“There may possibly be Advantages peculiar to each of these [the popular and the patriarchal] Schemes, and whether the Patrons of them will own it or no, there are Difficulties and Objections too that embarrass both.—Now if there be any third Hypothesis, which, having the main Advantages of these two, provides against the ill Consequences of each, it ought certainly to have the Preference. I am mistaken if the following does not bid fair for it: The Hypothesis in short is this, That all Power is directly from God, not by positive Appointment, but as he is pleased to signify his sovereign Will by the Nature of Things, leaving it to the Choice and Discretion of People among whom Governments are not yet established, in what Form, by what Persons, and on what Conditions this Power shall be exercised. The Power itself flows from the Will of the Creator, declared with that Plainness and Evidence that no Part of Mankind can be ig∣norant ”of it.</Q> See an Essay on the Origin and Extent of civil Power among the Miscellanies of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry Grove</HI>, Octavo, 1739.</P><P>But this Author seems to have been little aware that the very same Doctrine is the Subject of an Essay upon Government, written by Dr. <HI>Thomas Burnett</HI>, Rector of <HI>West Kington</HI>, in the County of <HI>Wilts</HI>, and printed first in Duodecimo in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and again in Octavo in 1726, wherein he thus declares his Senti∣ments: <Q>“As the Welfare of Society is the End and Reason of all Government, so the different Interests of different Societies is the Reason of the different Forms of it: And as it cannot be doubted, but that these different Forms were devised by Men, so though the Authority of Government be from God, yet the Appointment of the Persons to execute that Authority is purely and intirely the Ordinance of Man. And this gives an Account of that Expression, 1 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 13. of being sub∣ject to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's Sake; by which is meant, that those who are intrusted with the Go¦vernment of Societies in any Kind of Form, are only the Ordinance of Men; but yet, though they are so, they are nevertheless to be submitted to, for the Lord's Sake, because they execute that Power in Behalf of the Society, which ”every Society has from God.</Q> Lib. cit. Page 32, Edit. 1726.</P><P>The Coincidence of Opinions between these two Writers is very remarkable, seeing that, without being conscious of so doing, they illustrate the Arguments of each other; and it cannot but be Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter of Surprise to find, as the Reader may, the very same Doctrine maintained by that very able and judi∣cious Writer on Government, <HI>Hooker</HI>, in the following Passage, in the eighth Book of his Ecclesiastical Polity, Page 444. Edit. 1682. <Q>“On whom Power is bestowed at Men's Discretion, they do hold it by Divine Right: If God, in his revealed Word, hath appointed such Power to be, although himself extraordinarily bestow it not, but leave the Appointment of Persons to Men; yea albeit God do neither appoint nor as∣sign the Person; Nevertheless, when Men have assigned and established both, Who doth doubt but that sundry Duties and Affairs depending thereupon are prescribed by the Word of God, and consequently by that very Right to be exacted? For Example Sake, the Power which <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors had over foreign Provinces, was not a Thing which the Law of God did ever institute: Neither was <HI>Tiberius Caesar</HI> by espe∣cial Commission from Heaven therewith invested, and yet Payment of Tribute unto <HI>Caesar</HI>, being now made Emperor, is the plain Law of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Unto Kings by <HI>human</HI> ”Right, Honour, by very <HI>divine</HI> Right, is due.</Q> The Doc∣trine above advanced is finely illustrated by the same Author in the following apt Comparison: <Q>“The Law appointeth no Man to be a Husband; but if a Man hath betaken himself unto that Condition, it giveth him Power and Authority ”over his own Wife.</Q></P><P>These Citations seem abundantly to prove against the No∣tion of a Grant in the one Scheme, or a Donation in the other, yet comprehending both; that the Authority of the Magistrate does, by divine Appointment, <HI>result from</HI>, or arise out of, the Relation between him and his People, in like Manner as that of a Husband does from the Relation between him and his Wife.</P></NOTE>. It is sufficient here to say, that Government was originally instituted of Necessity; and being calculat∣ed,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
not merely to avert the Evils to which a State of Nature must have exposed Mankind, but to promote and ensure all the various
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Blessings of Society, and by directing, con∣trouling, and regulating the social Offices in this Life to fit and prepare us for a better, it is, and must ever be deemed, an Object of high Veneration.</P>
<P>Omitting then an Inquiry into the Ori∣gin, let us look to the Ends of Government, which we shall find to be no other than the Good of the People, or, in other Words, the promoting, by Laws and political In∣stitutions founded in Wisdom and Justice and corresponding with the revealed Will of God, the Happiness of those who are the Subjects of it, or over whom it is exercised: Whatever are the Distinctions, the Honours, the Emoluments with which they are in∣vested,
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
who hold or which accrue from the Exercise of great Offices in the State, these are merely incidental: In a Word, not for the Sake of the Governours, but of the governed, was civil Government first instituted.</P>
<P>But as the Ends of Government cannot be answered without Subordination and legal Submission on the Part of those who derive Benefit from it, there necessarily results an Obligation on the People, of Obedience to the legislative and executive Powers, in what Hands soever lodged: And not to Obedi∣ence only, but to Respect and Veneration, without which Government is in Fact, what all Laws do but presume it to be, Coercion; and those Restraints will be looked on as little better than Slavery, which are in Truth the greatest possible Security of Liberty. For if we admit, as we must, that there is a Principle in Men that disposes them to resist Authority, what is Government but Force? and that there is such a Principle no one can deny, who is at all acquainted with human Nature <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Laws politic, ordained for public Order and Regimen amongst Men, are never framed as they should be, unless presuming the Will of Man to be inwardly obstinate, rebel∣lious, and averse from all Obedience unto the sacred Laws of his Nature: in a Word, unless presuming Man, in regard of his depraved Mind, little better than a wild Beast, they do accordingly provide, notwithstanding, so to frame his outward Actions, that they be no Hindrance unto the common Good, for which Societies were instituted: Unless they do this, they are not perfect. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Ecclesiastical Polity, Page 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>That such Respect and Veneration as is here mentioned is due from the People to their Governours, is not only deducible from the Principles of natural Reason, and the uniform Tenor of the Sacred Writings, exhorting us to a dutiful Subjection and Obedience to lawful Authority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 1. <HI>Titus</HI> iii. 1. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 13.</NOTE>, but the Exercise of these Dispositions, so necessary to the Existence of Order and the Pro∣motion of national Happiness, is clearly dis∣cernible in the Conduct of Mankind and the Oeconomy of the World from the earliest Ages to the present; and that not only in Countries and Nations where the Arts of civil Life, the Refinements of human Policy, and the Precepts of Religion have been equally unknown; but in those enlightened Regions where the Powers of Reason and Reflection have been cultivated to the Height of Philosophy.</P>
<P>These Arguments, drawn from the Na∣ture and End of Government, the Sanction of Holy Scripture, and the general Assent and Practice of Mankind, might be thought sufficient to establish so simple a Position as that the Obligations of the Government, or, to adapt the Term to our own Consti∣tution, of the Prince and his People, are re∣ciprocal; so that if the Duty of one be to afford Protection, that of the other is to
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
yield Obedience; yet may they be further enforced, by a Reflection on the Utility of Government, as manifested in the Bles∣sings it dispenses, as well in the Execution as the framing of Laws for the Benefit and Security of the Subject. Blessings which can only be estimated by a Com∣parison that places the Enjoyment of Wealth, the Fruits of Industry, and the Sweets of domestic Felicity on the one Hand, and Terror, Rapine, and Desolation on the other.</P>
<P>To the Arguments arising from the Bene∣fits to Society which Government ensures, I might add the many others deducible from the Miseries that attend the Want of it; but these are evident. Nevertheless, I cannot omit to mention a political Artifice, a cruel one I confess, which we are told was formerly practised in one of the four great Monarchies pointed out by the Pro∣phet <HI>Daniel</HI>; I mean that of the ancient <HI>Persians</HI>; among whom it was a Custom, immediately on the Death of their Kings, to proclaim a Suspension of the Laws, and Im∣punity to Offenders for five Days; during which interval the Ravages and Depredati∣ons of Robbers, and other lawless Men, were usually so great, as to drive the People to an Impatience for the Restoration of Govern∣ment, and a willing Submission to that
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Authority which uninterrupted national Fe∣licity frequently induces Men to undervalue, if not contemn.</P>
<P>From these Considerations on the Nature and End of Government, the Transition is obvious to those Laws that tend to the Sup∣port of it; and here let me observe, that, although in common Speech we are fre∣quently led to say, that the Laws are the King's Laws, and in the Bills preferred to you Offences are said to be against the King's Peace, yet are the Laws no less the Laws of the People than of the King; these, and all the Benefits arising from them, the Freedom of his Person, the Security of his Property, the Protection of his Dwelling, and of his Wife and Children, these, I say, an <HI>Englishman</HI> regards as the Price of his Allegiance, and claims and challenges as his Birthright.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to an Explanation of the Nature of your Office, and an Enume∣ration of the several Offences of which it gives you Cognizance. As to the first, you are to understand, that in all Cases which draw into Question the Life, the Liberty, or the Property of the Subject, the Judgment of the Law is sounded on the Determination of twelve Men; which Determination, as it is supposed to result from a careful Investiga∣tion and Inquiry into the Truth of the Case, is called a Verdict. This is the ordinary
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
Process in civil Cases, which go no farther than to draw into Question a Man's Title to his Estate, or subject him to a Demand of Reparation in Damages for mere personal Injuries: In these Instances the Delinquent is immediately called upon to answer the Charge of his Adversary, even though the subject Matter of it be groundless, frivolous, or vex∣atious: But in criminal Matters, that is to say, in Treason, Felony, and Breaches of the Peace, which subject the Offender to the Loss of Life, the Restraint of Liberty, or the Payment of a discretionary Fine, the Law is abundantly careful, in that it interposes be∣tween the Complaint and the Trial of the Offence, an Inquiry into the Nature and Motives of the Prosecution; to the End, that if less than probable Evidence shall be produced in Support of it, the Person ac∣cused shall be dismissed by your Return of Ignoramus. In these Presentments of a Grand Jury, consisting generally of twenty-three Persons, a Majority must concur, from whence it follows, that before a Person can be convicted on a criminal Charge, two Juries must pass upon him, making toge∣ther twenty-four Persons; the one to repel frivolous, vexatious, and malicious Com∣plaints, the other to review such as have re∣ceived your Sanction, admitting in Evidence and Argument every possible Circumstance of Exculpation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15"/>I have further to inform you, that an In∣dictment or Presentment by a Grand Inquest is no Part of the Trial of the Offence, but merely an Information or Declaration for the King: <Q>“For were the Indictment Part of the Trial, then ought he that is noble and a Lord of Parliament to be indicted by his Peers; whereas the Indictment of Peers of the Realm is always by Freeholders, and not ”by their Peers.</Q> I cite this as the Opinion and express Declaration of one of the ablest Lawyers that ever filled the Seat of Justice in this Country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">III Institut. 26. Vide also <HI>Co. Litt.</HI> Sect. 194. <HI>Fortesc.</HI> de laudib. Cap. 26. <HI>Staundf.</HI> Plees del. Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on. Lib. 2. Fo. 90.</NOTE>, and draw this Inference from thence, as also from the uniform Prac∣tice of every Court of criminal Jurisdiction in the Kingdom, that an Inquiry by a Grand Inquest is not to be directed by those Rules of Evidence that are prescribed in the Case of a Trial by a Petit Jury, but that proba∣ble Evidence is in all Cases a legal and justi∣fiable Ground for your finding an Indict∣ment a true Bill <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Babington</HI>'s Advice to Grand Jurors in Cases of Blood, 16▪ 63, 125, et passim.—Sir <HI>James Astry</HI>'s General Charge to Grand Juries, 14.—<HI>Billa vera</HI> is the Indorsement of the Grand Jury, upon any Presentment or Indictment which they find to be <HI>probably</HI> true. <HI>Terms de la Ley.</HI>—Delatio aut in judicium postulatio nihil aliud est quam duodecem virorum prejudicium, quod sinem tamen principalï negotio nullam affert, sed conjecturam aut opinionem verius, quo circa de absentibus etiam inquiritur et de noncitatis. <HI>Tho. Smith</HI> de Repub. Anglor. Lib. ii. Cap. 26.—State Trials, Vol. iii. 416. Vol. v. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>The Offences cognizable by you are such as either immediately or remotely tend to the Disturbance of the Public Peace; and these are either capital, and punishable by Loss of Life and Forfeiture of Goods, or fineable, subjecting the Offender to a discre∣tionary Fine; and, in atrocious Cases, to the Imprisonment of his Person.</P>
<P>Under the first Head of this Division are comprehended the Crime of Treason, of which there are two Species, that is to say, High-Treason and Petit-Treason, and Fe∣lonies, of which there are dive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, some at the Common Law, and others by Statute; of the former it may be observed, that High-Treason is an Offence against the State, and of the others that they are each Offences of a less public Nature, Petit Treason being the Term appropriated by Law to homicide committed on a Subject, between whom and the Of∣fender a special Obedience and Subjection is supposed; as from the Wife to her Hus∣band, from a Servant to his Master, or from a Clerk to his Bishop or Diocesan: The other, that is to say, Felony, is of various Kinds, the most obvious of which are Mur∣der, Robbery, Burglary; and in general, every Kind of Larceny, or Stealing.</P>
<P>And here it is my Duty to inform you, that in the higher and lower Offences, that is to say, High-Treason and Larceny, the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
Law makes no Distinction between the Prin∣cipal and the Accessary. So that, in these Offences, not only the Actor, but he who shall stand by, and by Words or Gesticu∣lations abet, instigate, or excite him to, or encourage him in the Commission of the Offence, such a one I say is, in the Judg∣ment of the Law, equally culpable with the Actor: And for this you may discern a most cogent Reason; for in some In∣stances you will in Fact find the Accom∣plice to be the Principal in the Offence; as where a Boy is employed in the bur∣glarious Entry of a House, while another stands by and encourages him to venture in; or where a Mob are excited to Out∣rage by the Counsel, Persuasions, Direc∣tions, or Acclamations of one or more par∣ticular Persons: In both these Cases, and they are such as very frequently happen, the Abettors and Encouragers are equally responsible in Law with the immediate Per∣petrators of the Mischief <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I. <HI>Hawk.</HI> P. C. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From a Retrospect to the late Instances of Tumult and Outrage, and those Insurrec∣tions which gave rise to them, it is to be feared that some are involved in the Guilt of High-Treason: I shall be extremely cau∣tious in my Directions to you on this Head, and shall choose rather to deliver the Sense
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of the Law in the Words of the Law it∣self, and of its ablest Expositors, the Judges of the Land, than risque the misleading you by any mistaken Conceptions of my own.</P>
<P>In the earlier Times, the Judges and Law∣yers held a Diversity of Opinions respec∣ting the Crime of High-Treason; many Offences being then included under that Denomination, which the Law has since thought proper to reject. At this Day the several Kinds of Offences that constitute this Crime stand enumerated in a Statute of the 25th of <HI>Edw.</HI> III. which, as it is the only legal Test of Treason, has ever been looked upon as the Subject's great Security: Among other Acts of Violence it is thereby expressly declared to be <Q>“High-Treason to levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or to be adherent to his Enemies in his ”Realm:</Q> <Q>Upon the former of which Clauses the uniform Determination of the Judges has been, “that those who make an Insurrection, in order to redress a Public Grievance, whether it be a real or pre∣tended one, and of their own Authority attempt with Force to redress it, are said to levy War against the King, although they have no direct Design against his Per∣son; inasmuch as they insolently invade his Prerogative, by attempting to do that
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
by private Authority, which he by public Justice ought to do, which manifestly tends to a downright Rebellion; as where great Numbers by Force attempt to re∣move certain Persons from the King; or to lay violent Hands on a Privy Counsel∣lor; or to revenge themselves against a Magistrate for executing his Office; or to bring down the Price of Victuals; or to ”reform the Law or Religion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I. <HI>Hawk.</HI> 37.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>The same is asserted upon equal Authority, of “those who assemble in great Numbers for the Purpose of breaking Prisons, and delivering or setting at Liberty Persons therein con∣”fined <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hale</HI>'s Hist. Placit. Coron. Vol. I. 133.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>And although the Idea of levying War seems to include the bearing or carrying of∣fensive Arms, such as Guns, Swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet the Want of these Circumstances has been held of no Weight; the Number of the Insurgents supplying the Want of Military Weapons <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster</HI>'s Crown Law, 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The true Test and Criterion of an Insur∣rection is, the Intent or Purpose for which the Parties assemble. If it be on Account of some private Quarrel, or to take Revenge on particular Persons, it amounts to no more than a Riot; but if it be with a more ge∣neral
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
View, and for any of the Purposes above-mentioned, especially with a display of Flags or Colours; the beating of Drums, or other Incentives to Tumult and Outrage; and where the Insurgents are provided with Axes, Crows, and other Tools of the like Nature, proper for the Mischief they intend to effect; such an Insurrection, such an As∣sembling as this, though not immediately against the Person of the King, is doubt∣less a levying War against him, and by ne∣cessary Consequence High-Treason within the Statute <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster</HI>, 208, 209.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The capital Offences next in Degree to Treason are Felonies, and these are divers; some being at the Common Law, and others by Statute. In the former Class are included Murder, Larceny, Robbery, Burglary, and an Offence termed in our Law <HI>Arson</HI>, or the maliciously and voluntarily burning the House of another by Night or Day <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I. <HI>Hawk.</HI> P. C. 105.</NOTE>; Fe∣lonies by Statute are much more numerous; and the present Occasion calls upon me to direct your Attention to a Statute made in the first Year of King <HI>Geo.</HI> I. by which it is enacted, <Q>“That if any Persons, to the Num∣ber of Twelve, or more, being unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled to∣gether, to the Disturbance of the Public

<P>It would take up more of your Time than can well be spared, were I to enume∣rate all the several Offences that the Law has subjected to the Inquiry of a Grand In∣quest. Of those that remain unspoken of the chief are Larcenies, or Felonies of the lesser Kind, Perjury and Subornation there∣of, Nusances and Affrays.</P>
<P>Under the first Head are comprehended the stealing Things of small Value, with∣out any Circumstances of Terror to the Owner; and it affords a very melancholy Proof of the increasing Depravity of the Times, and of the little Regard paid by the common People to the Laws of God, and the Precepts of Religion, that the gra∣dual Improvements of Theft and Depreda∣tion seem to have out-gone those of the Law, and to have eluded and set at nought
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
all possible Contrivances for the Security of Property. Not to mention the various Methods of privately stealing from Persons in the Streets or in Public Assemblies, our Humanity is affected by the Consideration that, in the Villages adjacent to the Metro∣polis, scarce any one resident therein, be his Condition ever so low, can call any Thing his own: and that this is truly the Case, who needs to be told who sees posted up in every Country Retirement, a Caution importing no less than the Loss of a Limb to him who shall attempt the stealing from thence a favourite Plant, Fruit, perhaps un∣ripe, or it may be a Handful of Flowers? This it is well known is a recent Expedient for the Security of rural Property, and ar∣gues a Change of Manners among the lower Order of People, which is but one Way to be accounted for.</P>
<P>From Crimes that affect the Persons and Properties of Men, I pass to such as tend to the Obstruction or Hindrance of public Justice; the most atrocious of which are Perjury, and the Subornation thereof. The Credit of human Testimony is of such Im∣portance to Society, that, where it fails, the Laws are either rendered of no avail, or are perverted to Purposes the most injurious, and resemble wholesome Nutriment con∣verted

into Poison. By Means of Perjury the innocent are condemned, and the guilty suffered to go free; and upon this Offence I cannot omit to point out to you an Obser∣vation that has frequently occurred to me in the Exercise of my Office of a Magistrate, namely, that in giving Evidence, Men fre∣quently practise a Sort of Casuistry, which they think absolves them from the Guilt of Perjury, distinguishing in their own Minds between swearing to the Hurt, or for the Benefit of another; and I have known a Witness, for Fear of incurring the Guilt of Perjury, scruple swearing to the Person of an Offender, in Order to his Conviction; who I have been persuaded, to exculpate him, would not have hesitated falsely to depose, that at the Time of committing the Offence the Person charged was sleeping in his Bed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Very little short of the Case here supposed, was the fol∣lowing one of an Offender, a few Years ago tried before me at the <HI>Middlesex</HI> Session. Some Custom-House Officers being in Search of smuggled Goods, the Mob rose and resisted them with a Discharge of Fire Arms; and a Riot ensued. The Prisoner was apprehended as one of the Rioters, and being carried before a Magistrate, alledged, in Proof of his Innocence, that at the Time of the Riot he was ten Miles from the Place where it arose, viz. at <HI>Croydon</HI>, in <HI>Surry</HI>. Forgetting this his Defence before the committing Magistrate, he at his Trial produced a friendly Witness, who swore, that for a certain Period, commencing and ending with the Riot, the Offender was in his own Room, having locked himself in; and that he, the Witness, through the Chinks of an adjoining Apartment, saw him remain there till the Tumult was over. It happened, however, that the committing Magistrate being in Court, produced the Examination taken before him; and, the same being properly attested, and the Evidence of his be∣ing active in the Riot appearing full and clear, the Jury found the Offender guilty; and, if I do not mistake, the Court committed the Witness for the Perjury.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>Of Nusances there are many and various Kinds. These stand opposed to private In∣juries; and in judicial Proceedings are ever laid as against the King's Peace, and to the Annoyance of his Subjects. Under this Head are comprehended Obstructions of the public Highways, Buildings and Erections for the carrying on of noxious Trades and Businesses, Gaming-Houses, Places of lewd Resort, and Places of public Diversion not licensed ac∣cording to an Act of Parliament, made in the Reign of the late King. The Mischiefs severally arising from these are obvious; and it is Part of your Duty, as they shall come to your Knowledge, or fall within your Ob∣servation, from Time to Time, to present such Offences and Places, in order to the Pu∣nishment of those Persons who by Law are made responsible for their Act in the one In∣stance, and their Conduct in the other.</P>
<P>Affrays and Assaults on the Persons of In∣dividuals, though nominally Offences against the King, and therefore fineable at the Dis∣cretion of his Justices, are, nevertheless, near∣ly
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
similar in their Nature to the civil Action of Trespass; inasmuch as the Fine upon Con∣viction is in most Instances imposed with a View to the pecuniary Satisfaction of the Prosecutor. In Complaints of this Sort, where the Injury is but small, the Magistrate, to whom the Complaint is first made, cannot better exercise his Humanity, and I may add, his Wisdom, than by persuading the Parties to Peace and Reconciliation; an Expedient which I have seldom known to fail: yet if he thinks proper to bind the Offender over, your Duty is, upon probable Evidence, to find the Bill.</P>
<P>I will not at this Time trouble you with the particular mention of the many Statutes that have from Time to Time been made for the Support and Encouragement of Religion; nor farther enlarge upon that Topic, than to inform you, that of political Institutions the Wisest suppose the Being of a God, the Belief of a Providence that over-rules and directs the Actions of Men, and a future State of Rewards and Punishments: and as the fullest Evidence of these important Truths is con∣tained in the sacred Writings, the Founders of our excellent Constitution have recognized the Christian Religion, and by an Ecclesi∣astical Establishment declared it to be Part of the Law of the Land.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>I am sufficiently aware that a Religion protected, as that of this Country is, by Laws and Statutes that make it penal to controvert its fundamental Precepts, notwithstanding that it gives to scrupulous Consciences every reasonable Indulgence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Indulgence has been farther extended by a very late Act of Parliament; and it is but Justice thus publicly to de∣clare, and it will afford Satisfaction to many to be informed, that the same has been gratefully accepted; many of the most eminent Dissenting Teachers in this County having legally qualified themselves for the Exercise of their Function, by complying with the Terms thereof.</NOTE>, is by its Enemies termed the Religion of the Magistrate: in one View it may, perhaps, appear so; yet, were the Countenance and Support of the civil Power wanting in this Instance, it is much to be questioned whether among us we should have any Religion at all.</P>
<P>But be the established Religion what it may, it is at least your Duty to protect it: from Infidels and Sceptics it has nothing to fear; for such has been the Effect of the Re∣searches of learned and inquisitive Men, of a Profession to which we are under the greatest Obligation, who with unremitted Care and the most sedulous Application have set them∣selves to search the Scriptures, that the Evi∣dence of its divine Authority, its Truth, and Excellency is every Day accumulating; so that our own Experience seems to co∣incide with the Assurance of the Gospel <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> xvi. 18.</NOTE>,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
<Q>“That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail ”against it.</Q> I say, from such Enemies as these Christianity has little to fear; nevertheless from Insult and Contumely it looks to you for Defence; and to this End, Laws have been enacted, and con∣tinue still in Force, that subject to your No∣tice, and subsequent Punishment, all such as by Writing, Printing, Teaching, or advised Speaking, deny the Existence of God, or as∣sert that there are more than One, or that deny the Truth of the Christian Religion, or the Authority of the Scriptures, or that shall revile the Sacraments, or speak in Derogation of the Book of Common-Prayer <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">9 and 10 <HI>Will.</HI> III. Cap. 32. 1 <HI>Edw.</HI> VI. Cap. 4. 1 <HI>Eliz.</HI> Cap. 2. § 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this extensive Jurisdiction, which I have attempted to delineate, the Law has added the Correction of the public Manners, and has given you Authority to inquire of and present Offences <HI>contra bonos Mores</HI>, or, in other Words, against the Rules of De∣cency: under this Head are comprehended Bathing in public Places adjacent to High∣ways and Foot-paths, and the Violation of the Rights of Sepulture.</P>
<P>Having taken Occasion to mention the Subject of Religion, it cannot be amiss if I apply it to the Circumstances of your present
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
Attendance, by reminding you, as I now do, of its Obligations; and of them the least that can be asserted is, that they bind you by the Hope of the greatest Rewards, and the Dread of the severest Punishments, to the Observance of an Oath, perhaps the most solemn and awful that the Wit or Ingenuity of Man can devise: for you ought to remember, as I trust you do, that it is meant to restrain you from presenting any Thing for Malice or evil Will, and obliges you not to leave any Thing un∣presented for Love, Favour, Affection, Re∣ward, or any Hopes thereof.</P>
<P>In these two emphatical Sentences are comprised the Duty of a Grand Inquest: I refer you to your Consciences for the Dis∣charge of it, and dismiss you to the Dispatch of that Business, which by this Time calls for your Presence.</P>
