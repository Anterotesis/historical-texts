<HEAD>A New Test OF THE SENCE OF THE NATION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are now so many Ways contriv'd to byass the Judgment of the People, and the People themselves have taken up so many New Ways to express them∣selves, that we are oblig'd to take <HI>New Ways also,</HI> to understand them by. Nothing is more cer∣tain, than that the Methods of Understanding Things must vary as the Methods of Expressing
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
them vary, or else the Actions of Men will soon come to speak a Language not at all to be un∣derstood, and the Voice of Things will have as much Confusion as the Voices of Men had of Old at the Building of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>Among the great Variety there is to be found in the World of this Kind, nothing seems more remarkable, than the frequent Alterations made in the Meanings of the same Things, whether spoken or done in these few late Years; by which it is grown preposterous to expect, that Men shou'd be suppos'd to mean the same Thing to Day, that they meant yesterday by the same Words.</P>
<P>This might be illustrated by many Examples, but by nothing more plainly than by the various Use, Intent, Meaning and Design of SWEARING; especially that of Taking or Refusing Oaths to Governments, Allegiance to, and Abjuration of Princes, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Here</HI> Men stand off, and refuse to take Oaths to the last Minute, and then with the utmost Re∣luctance, to save a Place, Benefit, or Preferment, they take this Oath, and yet at the same Time, swear that they do it <HI>Heartily, Willingly</HI> and <HI>Truly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In another Case,</HI> Men abjure Foreign Preten∣ders, <Q>“”Declaring, Testifying, Professing and Acknowledging <HI>(Vide the Abjuration)</HI> that they do believe in their Conscience, that the Pre∣tended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or King <HI>James</HI> III. so calling himself, hath not any Claim, or Title to the Crown of this Realm, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And at the same Time, these Gentlemen in their open Profession, acknowledge the said Pretender, <HI>Drink his Health</HI> upon their Knees, Pray <HI>Cap in Hand,</HI> for his Restitution, and Act openly for his Interest; of which, the Author humbly prays, the swearing <HI>Jacobites</HI> not to put
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
him to the Necessity of bringing numerous Ex∣amples, for Fear of a <HI>Black List,</HI> they wou'd not be glad to see come abroad in the World.</P>
<P>And yet all these Contradictions are easie to be reconcil'd, and the Honesty and Integrity of the Parties may be clearly defended, and this is the Work of the present Undertaking, per∣haps, you may think it difficult, but you may be of another Opinion when you have duly con∣sider'd the Particulars.</P>
<P>There is a Thing call'd <HI>The Sence of the Na∣tion;</HI> by which, all Things of this Kind are deter∣min'd and understood; and this prevails not against the Literal Meaning of Words only, but against the plain and visible Construction of Mens Actions, and is now become the only true Rule to judge by. <HI>Custom</HI> has by the Law of Nations, obtain'd a very great Authority all over the World, having in all Ages, been the only Judge of <HI>Propriety,</HI> the Guide of Languages, the Allow'd Authority for Speech, and having given the true Legitimacy to Words. From hence, It is a most necessary Conse∣quence as well as a certain Truth, that <HI>Custom</HI> is the great Arbiter of <HI>Meaning</HI> in Speech: Nor can we give any greater Reason, nor <HI>in many Cases,</HI> any other Reason, for the Extensiveness of Words, than the Custom and Usage of the Country, that is in <HI>Eng∣lish, The Sence of the Nation.</HI> No Man can say, why a <HI>Spade</HI> is call'd a <HI>Spade,</HI> or a <HI>Tree</HI> a <HI>Tree;</HI> why <HI>Whore</HI> signifies a <HI>Leud Woman;</HI> why a <HI>weak-headed Man</HI> is call'd a <HI>Fool;</HI> why a Man that <HI>robs</HI> another is call'd a <HI>Thief:</HI> But that it is the Custom of the Place, that such Words shall be so understood, or to speak more plainly, <HI>This is the Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The same Authority is given for <HI>several Words</HI> signifying the <HI>same</HI> Thing, or <HI>several</HI> Things being
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
signify'd by the <HI>same</HI> Word, frequent Instances of which are to be given in our Language, and all are legitimated by <HI>Custom</HI> as the <HI>Sense of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>By this Authority of <HI>Custom</HI> a <HI>High-Church-Man</HI> and a <HI>Mad-Man,</HI> a <HI>Tory</HI> and a <HI>Thief,</HI> a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> are all become synonimous to one ano∣ther; tho' if we take the People and examine them apart, they pretend quite other Things; <HI>but</HI> it must be so understood, for <HI>'Tis the Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>But what shall we say to a new Tyranny of <HI>Custom,</HI> which is now invading us with Exotick Significations of Words, such as were never heard of here before: By which, for Example, a <HI>Sacheverellite</HI> and a <HI>Jaco∣bite,</HI> <HI>Mad-Juror</HI> and a <HI>Non-Juror,</HI> a <HI>High-Flyer</HI> and a <HI>French-Panist</HI> are become synonimous, and signi∣fy the same Thing; nor are the Etimologies or Vulgar Acceptations of the Words to be alter'd, or their Agreement to be interrupted by the Casual Intervention of <HI>Taking</HI> or <HI>Refusing</HI> Oaths, Abjura∣tions, Associations, or any such Trifles upon any Account whatsoever, <HI>The Reason is plain,</HI> for such is the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>All this is brought to pass, by the Wonderful Assistance, and Irresistable Force of <HI>CUSTOM,</HI> which, by her absolute Authority in the Kingdom of Speech, has full Power to cause what Construc∣tion <HI>she pleases</HI> to be put upon Words, and to cause them to be understood <HI>as best may serve</HI> to her Royal Ends and Purposes;—making those Constructions become <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<Q><L><HI>Custom,</HI> that all the World to Slav'ry brings</L>
<L>That Dull Excuse for doing filly <HI>Things.</HI></L>
<BIBL>Rochester<HI>'s Poems</HI> p. 72</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>We are next to prove,</HI> The Great Usefulness and Convenience of this to Mankind, and consequently,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
the Reasonableness, and indeed, Necessity of Sub∣mitting to this Government of <HI>Custom;</HI> as also, that <HI>in all Ages,</HI> and in <HI>all Nations,</HI> she has exercis'd this Authority, and that, therefore, having Prescription to plead for it, she is entitul'd by her <HI>immemorial self</HI> to an <HI>indeseizible Title</HI> to it, and may indeed her∣self be call'd <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>And first, to the Usefulness of it,—in which it appears like the <HI>Copernican</HI> System <HI>of Philosophy,</HI> which, tho' it admits of many Doubts, and has some Difficulties in it, which can allow no Demon∣stration, yet <HI>is receiv'd,</HI> because <HI>by that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> we can the better solve other <HI>Phenomena</HI> in Nature, which were perfectly unaccountable, and indeed, inconceivable before: So in this Case, tho' there may be some Objections perhaps, unanswerable a∣gainst this Tyranny of Custom, and some Diffi∣culties in our Subjection to it, which seem absurd, and admit of no Demonstration, yet <HI>we receive it</HI> as a Thing, by which, we can better solve some strange and wonderful <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in the Conduct of Mankind, which can no otherwise be accounted for, but by their being <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>By this Glorious System, a Man may sail <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> at the same Time in the great Ocean of Politicks; two Men may turn Back to Back in the great Road of Allegiance, and One Travel, <HI>that is, Swear,</HI> one Way, One another; and marching on strait forward meet at the same Point of Truth and Sincerity. <HI>For Example,</HI> A Man may <HI>swear</HI> to the Man he <HI>fights against,</HI> and <HI>fight</HI> for the Man he <HI>swears against:</HI> And all this only by <HI>Custom</HI> stepping in, and legitimating the Word <HI>SWEARING,</HI> and <HI>JESTING,</HI> to mean the same Thing in <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this a Novelty, or started to gratify a Party, <HI>No, no, Gentlemen;</HI> I will not do the <HI>Jacobites</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
so much Wrong. <HI>However necessary it may, at this Time, be to their Cause,</HI> and therefore, very happily made Use of by the Fathers of their Flock; but the Thing has ever been the <HI>Custom,</HI> of such Kind of People as they are compos'd of, <HI>and especially among its,</HI> and is, therefore, to be taken here as the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Nor shall I need to be sent back to the Hea∣then Ages of the World, whether <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman,</HI> in which, tho' the like Authority of <HI>Custom</HI> had in∣troduc'd the <HI>like Practice,</HI> yet Generous Principles had almost prevailed to explode her Authority; since it has been observ'd, to revive with the In∣troduction of Christianity, and to obtain more among the Christian Part of the World, than ever it did among the Heathen, and has almost in all Places <HI>among them,</HI> been the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>I need not go to Sacred Writ for the Perjury, or worse, of <HI>Jacob</HI> to <HI>Esau;</HI> Breach of Honour in <HI>David</HI> to the Posterity of <HI>Jonathan, and the like;</HI> since they have Exceptious in them, which, per∣haps, we cannot so well discant upon in this Place.</P>
<P>I need not dwell upon the <HI>Mahometans</HI> making a Jest of <HI>Keeping Faith with Christians;</HI> since we find <HI>Christians</HI> making the same Jest of <HI>Keeping Oaths to to those they call</HI> Hereticks <HI>and</HI> Phanaticks, and that in <HI>Rome, France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> it has been the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>What need I examine the JEST which Princes have made in the World, of their <HI>Swearing</HI> to Treaties and Capitulations. The Oaths, <HI>Anglice, JESTS</HI> of Renunciations of Right and Disclaim∣ing Successions.—The BANTER of Oaths call'd Coronation-Oaths to Subjects, and the like, these are so Subjects, and the like, these are so flagrant they need no Repetition and that they <HI>signify nothing,</HI> has long been allow'd in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Elsewhere,</HI> to be the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8"/>
Nor need I go far, to shew you the general Oaths taken by conquer'd Cities and Provinces, to the respective Conquerors <HI>Alternately</HI> as they subdu'd them. Nor the JESTING, I mean, <HI>Swearing</HI> of Nations to Princes, whom they think fit afterwards <HI>Nationally</HI> to Resist, and Depose; since their NON-SIGNIFICATION has on all Oc∣casions appear'd to be the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>After all these will you any longer question, that the Swearing, Fore-Swearing, or Back-Swearing; <HI>i. e.</HI> Abjuring of Parties, can be any more than JESTING; that it can be taken for any other by the Princes to whom, or meant for any other with the Parties by whom they are taken; and that their being taken for a Jest, is now become the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>What is that we call CUSTOM, but the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI> Or, The common Acceptat on, in which, such, and such Things are generally re∣ceived; and by which, the Signification, or Non-Signification of what is said, or done, is under∣stood in General.</P>
<P>Let's begin with what we call common Conver∣sation, <HI>Here</HI> CUSTOM, which I thus call the <HI>Sence of the Nation,</HI> has commanded that we should understand SWEARING to be really no less than JESTING, and when a Man wishes <HI>God may Damn him,</HI> or <HI>stop his Vitals;</HI> when he Curses <HI>his Blood,</HI> and swears <HI>By his Maker,</HI> or <HI>Redeemer;</HI> it is ex∣pected, in good Manners, you should understand him to mean <HI>Nothing at all,</HI> and 'tis plain, he is so understood in the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>God forbid, we shou'd be so barbarous and in∣humane, to take Men <HI>Literally</HI> when they swear, or to charge them with <HI>Meaning</HI> when they blas∣pheme God, <HI>damn themselves,</HI> and swear solemnly to what they say; this wou'd be the unreasonablest
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
Thing in the World, and you must then charge them with Perjury a Thousand Times a Day. The Case is plain, you must refer to the great Law of Custom, which is <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>This Custom governs Kingdoms as well as <HI>Men,</HI> and directs you to take all the Imprecations and Execrations of the Common Conversation of Men <HI>to signify nothing at all;</HI> as Froth upon your Drink, which proceeds from its Strength, but when you skim it off, the pure Liquor comes after; so this Swearing is nothing but a certain Froth or Foam of the Mouth proceeding from the Heat of the Passions, which Men throw by and take for no∣thing, and Skimming it off from Speech, the true Genuine Sence of the Man comes after it: And thus it is generally taken in the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it follows, That a Man shall swear a Thousand <HI>Street-Oaths</HI> in an Hour, to the Truth of a Thing <HI>which he knows nothing of,</HI> or to do some∣thing <HI>he never intends,</HI> or that he did something <HI>he never thought of,</HI> and yet remain a Man of Ho∣nour; if you bring him upon his Oath in a Court of Justice, or make him a Witness between Man and Man, you may depend upon his Evidence to be Punctual and True, and he scorns to for∣swear himself: Nay, he shall pass for a good Wit∣ness, notwithstanding his daily Perjury, <HI>in the Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The Reason is plain, <HI>Custom</HI> has preserv'd some Veneration to a Formal Oath in Bearing Witness, but <HI>The Sence of the Nation</HI> has long since taken away all Signification from the most violent Oaths in the World in common Speech, as Things that neither are intended, or shou'd be understood to have any Kind of Meaning at all in them. <HI>H</HI>—is an Eminent Justice of Peace, he punishes Drunkenness, Whoring and Swearing impartially, as the Law directs, and when a Man is brought
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
before him for these Crimes, he decently ex∣horts him to forbear; but he swears and blas∣phemes in the very Act of Executing the Law upon them, and damns himself upon the very Bench. The Case is plain, It is all without any Signification, nay, it is not to be call'd Speech, but a certain Excrement of the Passions which breaks out at the Mouth; it has a kind of Sound, indeed, like Words, but it is hardly known by <HI>the Parties themselves;</HI> it has no Communica∣tion with the Thoughts, and cannot be under∣stood to have any Meaning at all; like the <HI>Igni fatui</HI> in the Air, which have an Appearance of Fire, and give a kind of Light, or rather, a shining Reflection of Light, but have no Heat, and are esteem'd as a meer Vapour, without any Signification.</P>
<P>We might enter into the General Examina∣tion here, of the Manners of the Age, and we shou'd find, that it is the most necessary Thing in the World, that Custom shou'd allow Men to go on in a Method of Speaking without Signification.—That Abundance of the most Common Part of Humane Conversation shou'd be interlac'd with these Non-Entities in Speech: That as they are Ornaments in Style, and Useful Articles in Founding the most Essential Parts of Speaking, we cannot be without them.—<HI>The Reason is,</HI> Long Experience has found it necessary, and they are thus understood in the <HI>Sence of the Nation:</HI> More particularly, In <HI>Friendship,</HI> in <HI>Keep∣ing Secrets,</HI> in <HI>Treaties of Accommodation,</HI> in <HI>Recon∣ciliations of Differences,</HI> in <HI>Acknowledging Obligations,</HI> in <HI>Protestations of Gratitude,</HI> in <HI>New Acquaintan∣ces,</HI> in <HI>Seeking Favours,</HI> but above all, in <HI>Matters of Love, Gallantry,</HI> and <HI>Paying of Debts:</HI> I say, long Experience has found, that <HI>Oaths, Assevera∣tions,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
and the <HI>Deepest Imprecations,</HI> without the least Intent or Meaning either to keep or break them, must be made Use of in such Things as these.—They are thought necessary to <HI>fill up</HI> the Vacancies of Elocution, <HI>supply</HI> the Defect of Language, <HI>assist</HI> the Passions, appear <HI>instead</HI> of Sincerity, <HI>and the like;</HI> in all which 'tis not at all requisite, that any manner of Meaning shou'd go along with them.</P>
<P>There are innumerable Examples to illustrate this,—and many a Votary to a Party has left us their Dying Testimony of it <HI>at the Gallows,</HI> of which <HI>Coleman</HI> was a Famous Instance in the last Age,—has been so in this, and <HI>FƲLLER,</HI> they say, is a living Witness a∣gainst Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> for the like.</P>
<P>To bring it home to our Point, Custom hav∣ing thus legitimated this Practice, and <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Jesting</HI> being the same Thing in the <HI>Sence of the Nation,</HI>—It seems strange, that our foolish People should object against the Inconsistency of any Part of our Modern Oaths, I mean, in Publick Matters, <HI>such as,</HI> of <HI>Merchants</HI> taking Custom-House Oaths, which are become insigni∣ficant to a Proverb; <HI>Citizens</HI> taking the Oath of a Freeman, which 'tis impossible for some of them to keep; <HI>Assessors</HI> and <HI>Commissioners in Taxes</HI> take Oaths, which they never think of again. Men <HI>swear off</HI> Taxes, <HI>swear to</HI> Accounts, and <HI>swear</HI> upon Juries; <HI>swear</HI> when they <HI>go into</HI> Offices, and <HI>swear</HI> when they <HI>go out;</HI> swear <HI>to the</HI> QUEEN, and swear <HI>at the</HI> QUEEN;—and what is all this, but to tell us, that Custom has taken off the Sanction of Oaths, and esta∣blish'd this for a Law, That <HI>You are to take them,</HI> just as they that swear them, <HI>mean them,</HI> viz. <HI>for nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
From Oaths to Men, let us come to the Oath of God, aud see if that has any greater Force, we see it <HI>how corruptly soever</HI> of late de∣scended to serve Parties and publick Interests, and therefore, <HI>contrary to its Institution,</HI> plac'd as a Test of Civil Distinction, a Key, <HI>the De∣vil, they say, has the Lock,</HI> to Civil Preferments, an Introduction to publick Employment, a Sup∣port to Parties, and a Property to Hypocrites; and what's the Language of all this, but that it really <HI>signifies Nothing,</HI>—is receiv'd with∣out <HI>Thinking,</HI> administer'd without <HI>Meaning,</HI> and stands for a Cypher.</P>
<P>And now Good People, having laid down this New System in all our Politicks, it is, as I said before to you, <HI>a Test</HI> of its Usefulness: <HI>Thus,</HI> By this Philosophy we can solve all the strange <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in our Politicks, which have so long puzzl'd our People, nd laid stumbling Blocks in the Way of Honest Men. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>By this is made clear the Difficulty of Peoples <HI>Swearing</HI> to the Government, and Abjuring the Pretender, and yet <HI>Acting for</HI> his Interest, <HI>Drink∣ing his Health,</HI> and Owning him as their Sove∣reign.</P>
<P>By this is reconcil'd the Difficulty of the Mayor and Magistrates of <HI>M</HI>—bearing the Sword and Mace of Queen ANNE, and being Her Humble Servants all the Week, and yet going in their Formalities every Sabbath-Day to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Meeting-House, where they pray Openly for the Restoration of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> whom they have Abjur'd.</P>
<P>By this is reconcil'd Damming the Tollera∣tion, and yet not blaming the Indulgence to Tender Consciences.</P>
<P>By this is made clear the Consistency of
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
the Doctrine of Hereditary Right, and Non-Resistance, with the Act of Succession, and the Revolution, and as I said before, many other <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> which, in themselves admit of no Demonstration.</P>
<P><HI>CƲSTOM</HI> has declar'd, that all those <HI>Poli∣tick Oaths</HI> are taken as having no Significa∣tion; That we are to understand them, and the Takers of them to have <HI>no Meaning at all,</HI> and that they pass for Nothing; this being the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>On these Accounts they cannot be said to deceive us, for that we have nothing more to expect from them, than we ought to ex∣pect from People, that swear <HI>without Meaning,</HI> and look upon Oaths to have <HI>no Signification.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be forgotten here, that this re∣conciles the Endeavours some People use, as expect the Overthrow of the Tolleration, the Rupture of the Union, and the Dissolving the Establish'd Succession, notwithstanding her Ma∣jesty's Sacred Promise frequently given from the Throne to Support, and Defend them, and to Maintain the first of them inviolably.</P>
<P>It is evident, these Gentlemen take all these Sacred Pledges of Honour given by Her Majesty, to be like their own Swearing,—<HI>viz.</HI> to be taken for <HI>NOTHING,</HI> to have no Manner of Signification, so to be meant at first, <HI>and at last;</HI>—and that this is the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>It is farther evident, <HI>that</HI> in their Offering to put the Queen's Undoubted Title to the Crown, upon Her Majesty's Hereditary, not Parliamen∣tary Right; at the same Time offering no∣thing against the Legitimacy of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> they wou'd have Her Majesty believe, Her ha∣ving
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
<HI>NO RIGHT AT ALL,</HI> is the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in our Politick Philosophy, are solv'd very readily by this Doctrine of the Sovereignty of Custom, to establish the Mean∣ing, or No-Meaning of Speech, and to legiti∣mate the No-Meaning of the most Solemn Ac∣tions in the World.</P>
<P>This brings us down to the most clear De∣monstration, that any Man can desire of such a new advanc'd System, and I shall bring you abundant Testimony from all Parts of this Na∣tion, when in their most Solemn Applications to their Princes, the Good People of <HI>England</HI> have no other Testimony of their Sincerity and Honesty, either to God, their Sovereign, or themselves, than that they had no Mean∣ing at all in what they said.</P>
<P>This is to be found, or, at least, to be search'd for in the Famous Addresses, which upon sundry Occasions have been presented to our Princes from the Good People of <HI>England;</HI> particularly those in the late King <HI>Jame</HI>'s Time, upon the Subject of the Birth of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> the taking off the Penal Laws and Test, and the bringing <HI>Papists</HI> into Employment; not ex∣cluding some now presented, and presenting to Her Majesty, by several Sorts of People, on the Behalf of the Corrupted Doctrines of <HI>Here∣ditary Right, Non-Resistance,</HI> Dissolving <HI>Parlia∣ments,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps some People may alledge, that there has been a little Meaning in the Heads of the People in these Cases. But as such pretending Advocates will be brought to acknowledge <HI>those Meanings,</HI> to be absurd Contradictions to one another; inconsistent with Honour▪ Liberty, Con∣stitution
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
and Religion; and particularly, the Sorts of Addresses <HI>One with Another;</HI> I cannot but think the kindest as well as easiest to be demonstrated Truth <HI>we can say of them is,</HI> that they had no Meaning at all; that they were design'd by themselves to pass for nothing, <HI>re∣ceiv'd so by their Princes,</HI> and that this Opi∣nion of them has always been the <HI>Sense of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>However that any One may enter into the Enquiry, and tell us what they think: Whe∣ther it can be possible the People cou'd mean any Thing in these Addresses; and if they had any Meaning <HI>what it was:</HI> I shall present the Reader with a few of both the Kinds, set One against Another;—As to the <HI>Meaning</HI> or <HI>No-Meaning</HI> of the first Parcel, I shall evidence what I alledge, of their having been design'd <HI>to pass for nothing</HI> by their Authors from the Consequences. As to the second Sort, I shall leave them to the <HI>Sence of the Nation,</HI> to judge them by their Probability.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, Time has made it appear, that Addressing in King <HI>Jame</HI>'s Time, had no Meaning at all, other than a meer <HI>Pulling off the Cap,</HI> which we do to any Body we meet, with <HI>Your Servant Mr. Such a One,</HI> which really passes for just nothing at all; for if the Man was to go to the <HI>Gallows</HI> the next Day, you have nothing to say to him.—So it was the Fashion just then, to say any Thing which they thought <HI>their Prince wou'd be pleas'd with;</HI> to do any Thing he bid them; to thank him for every Thing he did, whether for or against them.—As to Liberty, Priviledges, Laws, Protestant Religion, and such like Things, they never troubled their Heads with them, nor
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
cou'd without <HI>infinite Scandal to their Sences,</HI> be said to have any Meaning at all about them—Thus they thank him for His <HI>Standing Army,</HI> tho' they knew it was rais'd to enslave them; for His <HI>Dispensing Declaration,</HI> tho' they knew it trampled upon the Laws: They sacrific'd the <HI>Penal Laws</HI> and <HI>Test,</HI> tho' it was evident, it was in Favour of <HI>Papists</HI> only: And they pro∣mis'd for their <HI>Parliament Men</HI> that they shou'd in all Things comply with His Desires, tho' that must effectually destroy the very Being of Par∣liaments.</P>
<P>After all these Fine Words, these very Ad∣dressors never perform'd one of these Things, and the kindest Thing I can say of them is, <HI>that they never intended it.</HI>—Not that I am reproaching them at all for Cheats and Hy∣pocrites, that wheedled and deluded their Princes, <HI>as I know some do;</HI> that first made him believe they wou'd be <HI>ridden</HI> into any Thing, that they wou'd <HI>submit</HI> to any Thing, wou'd have been <HI>as passive</HI> as they talk'd of, and wou'd really subject themselves, their Liberties, Laws and Religion to His Absolute Will: <HI>No, No!</HI> The good People were honester than so.—The <HI>Error lay here;</HI> the Thing was a customary Piece of Extravagance, and the King took them to be in Earnest.—<HI>Sir, Your most Obedient Ser∣vant,</HI> says a Man to me in the Street; if I shou'd bid him go of an Errand for me, he wou'd answer, <HI>What, Sir, do you take me for a Porter! Your Majesty's Royal Dispensing Right,</HI> says one Set of Gentlemen. <HI>We will choose such Mem∣bers as y ur Majesty shall recommend,</HI> say another. If the King puts it home to them, they an∣swer, <HI>What! Does His Majesty think we are all Slaves!</HI> The Matter is very plain, The Thing
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
<HI>stands for nothing;</HI> if the King took them to be in Earnest, <HI>that was His Fault,</HI> they gave Him very little Reason for it; they spoke Words of Course, Things usual in all Times, from Sub∣jects to Sovereigns; and which had nothing in them more than Words, and never use to be understood any farther.—<HI>Words of Custom,</HI> the Language of Good Manners, that they were to stand for nothing <HI>was the Sence of the Nation,</HI> and if he had had his Usual Sences <HI>a∣bout Him,</HI> they wou'd have stood for nothing with Him.</P>
<P>Thus King <HI>James</HI> was serv'd with His Addres∣sors, I cou'd have brought a List of the Universal Addressings of the Nation just in this Manner, and ev'ry Way as extravagant, to <HI>Richard Crom∣well</HI> of Old, not Two Months before they de∣pos'd him: <HI>Ditto</HI> to King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Se∣cond, when they abhorr'd Petitioning; when they gave up their <HI>Charters, Laws</HI> and <HI>National Priviledges</HI> to Him: <HI>Ditto</HI> to King <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> upon Occasions quite Differing, and Contradic∣ting to them all;—and all these wou'd be evident Testimonies that Addressing the Sove∣reigns in <HI>England</HI> from the Towns, Corpora∣tions, Counties, Grand Juries, &amp;c. has for ma∣ny Years past, been reckoned to stand for no∣thing; and is therefore, by Custom determin'd to be of no Manner of Signification.</P>
<P>I hope, the Reader will understand me tomean of such Addresses only, as have been made in Former Days: As to those now made, which are calculated to Things of a higher Nature, such as Telling Her Majesty <HI>what</HI> Title <HI>She reigns by,</HI> as if She did not know before; Promising to choose <HI>such Parliament-Men,</HI> as shall <HI>GIVE ƲP Parliamentary Right;</HI> Letting Her Majesty know
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
how joyful they shall be to have the Parliament dissolv'd, <HI>especally such of them as have Reason to apprehend Parliamentary Justice;</HI> letting Her Ma∣jesty know, they desire to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> and that, therefore, they hope She will change Her Ministry.</P>
<P>As to these great Things, it seems to me, these People, much better than any before them, speak as plainly to us <HI>as possible,</HI> that they would be understood to have <HI>NO MEANING.</HI> It would be the highest Presumption in the World, for Subjects to talk in this Manner to their Sove∣raign; and they could not but expect, even from a most mild, and mercifull Prince <HI>the ut∣most Resentment:</HI> And I can make no Question, but they would most certainly meet with it, were it not, that they know, and take it for granted, that these Things call'd <HI>Addresses,</HI> have always been allow'd to stand for nothing, have been <HI>desigu'd so</HI> by the People that sign'd them, been <HI>receiv'd as such</HI> by the Persons di∣rected to, and allow'd for such in the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Here follows some select Addresses, and Passa∣ges out of other Addresses, faithfully Collected from the Great Body of the <HI>Nothing-Signifying</HI> Addresses aforesaid, Presented to the Late King <HI>JAMES,</HI> not many Months before <HI>His Abdication,</HI> being the same Year of the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and which serve as a Proof of what has been laid down as above.

<P>HAving already with most sincere Devotion paid our Acknowledgments to God Almighty the Father of Mercies, we come now most humble prostrate at your Majesty's Feet, to offer our hearty Congratulations to your Majesty and Royal Consort, for the inestimable Blessing of a Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> a Prince giv'n by Divine Providence, to the Prayers of your Kingdoms, to per∣petuate your Majesty's Glo∣ry, and our Pelicity: May he so thrive, (and we doubt it not) under the great Ex∣ample of your Majesty's Pi∣ety and Prudence, that you your self may live to see him consummate in all the true Arts of Government, we far∣ther promise with the best of our Endeavours to send such Members to the next Parliament, as will co-ope∣rate with your Majesty's Gracious Intentions (accord∣ing to your Royal Declara∣tion)</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your Majesty,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE Your Majesty's most Dutiful and Obedient Subjects crave Leave to con∣gratulate your Majesty upon the early and successful Pro∣gress of your Armies, and those of your High Allies, which we believe to be the Continuance of God's Bles∣sing attending your Majesty's exemplary Piety and Good∣ness, as well as the consum∣mate Conduct of your Gene∣rals, and undaunted Courage of your Souldiers, and we shall ever cheerfully contribute to the effectual carrying on this necessary War, 'till the Com∣mon Enemy be disabled to give any farther Disturbance to the Peace of <HI>Europe,</HI> or to your Majesty's just Right and Title to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>NOW, Gentlemen, it has been a New <HI>and Approved</HI> Custom, and I think, it was begun by this very Doctor <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> whose Case the Addressers are Espousing, I mean, to prove and disprove from Quotations and Parts of Things, whether Blasphemous, Profane, Atheistical, or otherwise, as appears by his <HI>Collections</HI> brought before the Lords at his Tryal, and afterwards burnt by the Hangman.</P>
<P>We are, therefore, taking them in their own Way, and in Order to it, you have here repre∣sented to you a <HI>Chain of Smoak,</HI> a New Feather made of <HI>Fine Air,</HI> a <HI>Web spun</HI> of pure Vapour, the <HI>Warp</HI> is much of it <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> and the <HI>Woof Non∣sence.</HI> Wou'd any Man perswade me, <HI>the honest People</HI> that have talkt these Things to their So∣vereign, were so wicked as to have <HI>any Mean∣ing!</HI> Is it possible, they cou'd desire that we shou'd suppose they <HI>meant any Thing?</HI> Above all, Can we think they were <HI>such Fools,</HI> to ex∣pect the Princes to whom their Addresses were severally directed, cou'd imagine <HI>any Meaning</HI> in them! I hope, no Body that reads those Sheets can be so uncharitable.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For Example.</HEAD>
<P>When the City of <HI>Carlisle</HI> in their Second Ad∣dress to King <HI>James,</HI> talk of being <HI>Transported a∣bove Mortals,</HI> of <HI>God Almighty's</HI> PROJECTS: Of <HI>King</HI> James<HI>'s Ʋnparallell'd Dangers:</HI> Of <HI>The Miracle of the Prince of</HI> Wales<HI>'s Birth:</HI> Of <HI>the Qualities of</HI> King <HI>James</HI> above <HI>Constantine:</HI> And of Spending
<PB N="49" REF="50"/>
their Lives and Fortunes <HI>for the Young Gentleman's Safety:</HI></P>
<P><HI>When the same City in their Address before the Birth they speak of, say,</HI> They thank him for His <HI>ROYAL ARMY,</HI> which really is both the Ho∣nour and Safety of the Nation; <HI>that they will not fail</HI> to choose such Members, as will certainly concur with His Majesty, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Can any Man be so Weak and Foolish, <HI>or in∣deed, so Ʋnkind</HI> to the Citizens of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> as to think they had <HI>any Meaning</HI> in all this—Have their Actions since giv'n the least Ground of Suspicion that they <HI>meant any Thing?</HI> Have any One of 'em spent their Lives and Fortunes for the <HI>Pretender?</HI> Have they not Twice, or Three Times since that, addrest the <HI>Princes that keep him out?</HI> and, perhaps, with as much Mean∣ing: <HI>The Sum of all is,</HI> they were as honest, and had <HI>as much Meaning</HI> as Addressors are expected to have, or as <HI>most of them</HI> ever have.</P>
<P>Next let us come to the <HI>Bath,</HI> warm in their Acknowledgments for their Young Prince, <HI>as their Hot Springs, which they bousted helpt his Mo∣ther to Conceive;</HI> when <HI>good Men,</HI> in their Ad∣dress to King <HI>James,</HI> they Congratulate Him for being the Parent of <HI>so good a Son,</HI> (To be sure much of his Goodness was then known, for he was full 22 Days old.) Then of this Son be∣ing <HI>the Reward of Heaven for His Majesty's Decla∣ration for Liberty of Conscience;</HI> or in plainer <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> Heaven's Reward for the Merit <HI>of His Ma∣jesty's Breaking the Laws.</HI> Then, that they desire the Young Prince and His Posterity may live <HI>to baffle Mortality it self.</HI></P>
<P>Let no Man be so foolish to charge the Ho∣nest Citizens of <HI>Bath</HI> with meaning what they said in these Things, <HI>No No!</HI> they were better
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
Christians, as well as wiser Men, these Things were only <HI>Addresses,</HI> that is <HI>Words of Course</HI> with∣out any Signification, and cannot, without Breach of Charity, be taken otherwise.</P>
<P><HI>Cou'd it be possible, the Citizens of</HI> Bath <HI>cou'd say with any Meaning,</HI> We do Promise and Engage upon our Allegiance, that whenever Your Majesty shall think fit to call a Parliament, we will choose none to serve therein, but such as will give us full Assurance, that they will endeavour the Total Abrogation of the Penal Laws and Test.</P>
<P>Just as much Meaning, and just as punctually to be perform'd, are the like Protestations of our present Address from the same City, <HI>to which we refer;</HI> viz. That <HI>Daring to deny the Queen's Hereditary Right is a Damnable Doctrine,</HI> and that <HI>Such cannot be call'd Her Majesty's Subjects,</HI> &amp;c. Whereas Her best Subjects, and also the Laws expresly deny it.</P>
<P><HI>For a little more</HI> West-Country Meaning, <HI>let us take the Loyal City of</HI> Exeter, <HI>and here you have them telling their Popish Monarch,—of their Thanking God for the</HI> Ʋniversal Blessing of His Reign: <HI>Of</HI> His most Gracious and Merciful Government: <HI>(WESTERN MERCY!) Of</HI> His Actions having surpass'd any Thing that History cou'd offord: <HI>And to sum up all, That</HI> His Decla∣ration of Indulgence <HI>(to</HI> Popery <HI>as well as</HI> Dissenters) <HI>hath come up</HI> to the Agreeableness of Divinity it self, <HI>that is,</HI> they made Him a God: <HI>Then they tell him</HI> of His Eternal Honour and Glory, <HI>and the Genera∣tion having</HI> great Cause to bless God for Him; <HI>and the like monstrous Stuff!</HI> P. <HI>22.</HI></P>
<P>Let no Man be <HI>so unjust</HI> to the good People of <HI>Exeter,</HI> to charge them with the Crime of MEANING in one Word of what they said; the honest Men, to be sure, had never any such
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
Thoughts, <HI>they could not be so wicked,</HI> or so ab∣surdly blind to Matters of Fact and Common Sence, <HI>as well as to Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The Case is plain, They <HI>meant</HI> just as much then in their Deifying a <HI>Popish</HI> Prince, and the like, <HI>as they do now</HI> in their Detestation of <HI>Hereti∣cal, Blasphemous, Schismatical, Latitudinarian</HI> and <HI>Re∣publican</HI> Principles and Positions, <HI>P.</HI> 23. <HI>With which some People</HI> (they know not who) <HI>have endeavour'd to</HI> DEPRAVE THE CHRISTIAN FAITH; that's an Excellent Phrase, <HI>and full of Meaning, to be sure;</HI> That any Body shou'd suspect them OF MEANING in those Rhapsodies, must be very absurd, for my Part, I cannot be so cruel to them.</P>
<P>No more can the City of <HI>Hereford</HI> be tax'd with <HI>Meaning,</HI> when they say, <HI>They will ever</HI> OWE <HI>Dutiful and Loyal Obedience to King</HI> James, <HI>and His Heirs.</HI> (By the Way they promise to <HI>OWE</HI> it, but never promise to <HI>PAY</HI> it) certainly they meant no more in that, than they do now, in their New and <HI>Most modest Address</HI> to the Queen, by which they insult the Parliament in their Stating the Doctrine of <HI>Resistance,</HI> in the Tryal of Dr. <HI>Sacheverell;</HI> and reflect upon the said Par∣liament with <HI>Extreme Horror!</HI> No doubt, they <HI>MEAN</HI> in these Things, as much as other Folks <HI>MEAN,</HI> when they use for <HI>Forms-sake,</HI> a Confusion of Words without any Signification.</P>
<P>Now after all that can be said, It must pass for the kindest Thing Men can suggest of these honest Gentlemen, who are so lavish of their Extrava∣gant Expressions, <HI>viz. That they have</HI> NO MEAN∣ING; otherwise it will be a most difficult Task, to extricate them out of the Terrible Labyrinth of Contradiction they are fall'n into; and the Solemn Engagements to One Prince, Affronting their En∣gagements
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
eqally Solemn to another.—But all this is made easy only by Telling the Naked Truth of Things, <HI>viz.</HI> That really they have not been guilty of having <HI>the least Meaning</HI> in any Thing they have said,—and, no doubt, they hope Her Majesty will understand them so.</P>
<P>Again, Will any Man be so unnatural, as to charge the Gentlemen of <HI>Hartfordshire</HI> with Mean∣ing what they say, when they tell King <HI>James,</HI>—They promise their Endeavours to <HI>Choose such Representatives, as will,</HI> IN ALL RESPECTS, <HI>com∣ply with His Majesty's Desires,</HI> any more than the Gentlemen of <HI>Oxfordshire</HI> meant any Thing, in Telling the Queen, that it shall be <HI>to the Infinite Joy of all Her Subjects,</HI> whenever Her Majesty <HI>shall be pleased to call a New Parliament;</HI> whereas 'tis plain, that Joy is principally express'd, at least hitherto, by Her Subjects Withdrawing their Estates out of the Publick Funds, as not being so well satisfy'd with the Thoughts of a New Par∣liament, as they were with the Old.</P>
<P>But more wonderful yet! What shall we say to the Men of <HI>Kent!</HI> Most piously they tell King <HI>James,</HI> That <HI>His Admirable Goodness, Piety, and Ju∣stice had</HI> OBTAIN'D <HI>from God Almighty the Inex∣pressible Biessing of a Son.</HI> Will you say they thought one Tittle of what they said? It wou'd be too much Reproach upon their Profession of the Pro∣testant Religion, and their Zeal for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> whose Doctrine abhors such Here∣tical and Abominable Tenents; <HI>and therefore,</HI> 'tis much more Charitable to allow they <HI>meant no∣thing▪</HI> only that as such Addressors generally have, they had Occasion to say some Fine Words which had no Signification at all.</P>
<P><HI>Set against <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the Famous Address of <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI> now brought to the Queen, Famous not
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
only for the Language of it, but for the Man∣ner of it's being obtain'd, and <HI>it's Legitimacy to the Title of</HI> the Address of the County—wherein they tell Her Majesty, they will stand by Her <HI>in Defence of the Apostolical Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of</HI> England, <HI>in Opposition to all such Principles as strike at the Ruin of the</HI> MONARCHY. As if the Affair of the Monarchy was one of the Branches of the Apostolical Doctrine and Disci∣pline. Excellent Words indeed, and put together on Purpose to let Her Majesty know they neither understood them, nor desir'd to have any Body else understand them.</P>
<P>And what a barbarous Thing would it be to charge the poor Town of <HI>Cardigan</HI> with any Meaning in their late Address <HI>July</HI> 4. where they assure Her Majesty of their Loyalty <HI>after the Man∣ner of their Ancestors.</HI> This necessarily directs Her Majesty to look into the History of the Ancient Loyalty of the People of <HI>Cardigan,</HI> and in this Enquiry, no Doubt, great Things will appear—of which we shall give you a brief Specimen, e∣specially, as it respects to the Members they have sent up to Parliament for 70 or 80 Years.</P>
<P N="1">1. Coll. <HI>Wogan,</HI> He was arraign'd and try'd for Murther in the Town of <HI>Cardigan,</HI> but being odly brought off, was Elected Parliament Man for that Town, and was afterwards one of the pre∣tended Judges of King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, and sign'd the Warrant for His Execution.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>James Phillips,</HI> an Inhabitant of <HI>Cardigan,</HI> a Sequestrator, he enjoy'd the Profit of the Bishop∣prick of St. <HI>David</HI>'s by Sequestration, ruin'd all the Poor Clergy of that Diocess and defac'd the Ca∣thedral by selling the very Lead off of the Church, and the Brass and Iron from the Monuments of the Dead.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="54" REF="55"/>
3. <HI>John Vaughan</HI> also Parliament Man for <HI>Cardi∣gan,</HI> nam'd by King <HI>Charles</HI> the First, when He was Prisoner in the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> to treat for Him with the Parliament, but refused, and forsook Him.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the present Times they have been wor∣thily and suitably represented by Sir <HI>Humphrey Mackworth,</HI> famous for his Zeal for the persecu∣ting Laws offer'd against the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> but more especially famous, or infamous rather, for his ruining Thousands of Poor Men in the <HI>Vile Pro∣ject</HI> of the Mine Adventure, and his being Vo∣ted a Notorious Cheat by the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Who they have chosen now to represent them every Body knows, it is not doubted but the Gentleman may arrive to the Height, both in Honesty and Loyalty of these his Famous An∣cestors in that Employment.</P>
<P>Now, if these Gentlemen shou'd be understood to mean such Sort of Loyalty as this of their An∣cestors, it wou'd lye very hard upon their Re∣putation; without Doubt, it would be much more for their Honour to believe, that they, like the rest of their Brethren Addressors, <HI>Mean</HI> NO∣THING AT ALL, and design'd Her Majesty should understand them so.</P>
<P>Next, when the Gentlemen of the West-Ri∣ding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> in their Address from <HI>Pontefract,</HI> tell Her Majesty, that they abhor, detest, and ABJURE all Atheistical, Schismatical, &amp;c. Prin∣ciples and Practices; what wou'd they have Her Majesty, and the rest of Her People think of them? Certainly, they wou'd not have it known or believ'd, that they told Her Majesty a no∣torious premeditated Lye, since Nothing is more certain, <HI>than that</HI> no such Abjuration was ever made, or Oath against Schismatical Principles
<PB N="55" REF="56"/>
taken by any of them, and if it was, it would be very useful to let the World know, when 'twas so, and who administer'd such an Oath to them.</P>
<P>Now, this new System of having <HI>No Meaning</HI> at all, brings 'em off as clever as a Gun, and washes them as white from the Scandal of Talking Non∣sence to the Queen, as can be.—For having only muster'd up a Rhapsody of Words, which they meant for Nothing; and which they hoped, no Doubt, that Her Majesty wou'd take for Nothing; The Want of Truth in them was a Thing of no Signification, for what can it signify, whether Words that have no Meaning, have any Truth in them, or no.</P>
<P>The like I cannot but think is to be understood of our late <HI>Worcester</HI> Address, who in their Address thank Her Majesty for giving 'em so extraordinary a Lord Lieutenant, as His Grace, the D. of <HI>Shr—y.</HI> Had they stopt there, or had they giv'n the Rea∣son for it, from a Recapitulation of the known Honour and Virtue of that Noble Person, his Zeal for his Country, Early Appearing for the Re∣volution, and Steady Adhering to Her Majesty's Interest, and the Protestant Succession: These wou'd have giv'n us Ground to hope that the Men were in their Senses, and had some Meaning in what they said; but when they pass by all these, and as if they had no Sense of His Grace's Merit, put all the Weight of their Honour for His Grace, upon the Character of His Ancestors, who at the same Time were all <HI>Papists</HI>—This has such an evident <HI>No Meaning</HI> in it, that in Charity to the Poor Men, we must believe, either that they meant the most inveterate Satyr upon the Duke, as a Person of no Character, and upon the Queen, for Advancing such a Person to the Honour and Dignity His Grace now enjoys, or which is the
<PB N="56" REF="57"/>
only Way to save them from that Reproach,—That they thought nothing, design'd nothing, and in short, meant nothing at all.</P>
<P>The Burrough of <HI>Hindon,</HI> to show their Skill in <HI>Polemical</HI> Divinity, telling Her Majesty of the mis∣chievous Consequence of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> Schism, call their Doctrines Heretical and Abominable <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI>—Now it cannot be, that these Charitable Men would perswade the Queen that the <HI>Dis∣senters</HI> are <HI>Hereticks, No, no,</HI> Nothing like it; their Manners to the Queen, who has tolerated them, and promised to preserve that Toleration, as well as their Tenderness for <HI>Scrupulous Consciences,</HI> cannot permit us to think so of them: But all is easily reconcil'd by this new, and I hope, well approv'd System of having <HI>No Meaning at all,</HI> which seems to be a very happy Outlet to these Gentlemen, who have left no other Gap for Mankind to releive them by.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Dartmouth-Men</HI> tell King <HI>James,</HI> that the Birth of a Prince was <HI>The greatest Bles∣sing Heaven cou'd grant;</HI> Wou'd any Body be so absurd to say, or think, they <HI>meant any Thing;</HI> when in the same Address, they tell him they wish Ais Majesty Long Life, that he may <HI>in∣struct the Prince by his Example in</HI> PIETY, &amp;c. <HI>of which His Majesty is the most</HI> PERFECT PAT∣TERN. <HI>Vide</HI> Page 42. Must not these People either <HI>mean nothing,</HI> or mean that the Prince shou'd be <HI>bred a Papist,</HI> as the most <HI>Perfect Pat∣tern</HI> for Piety. Horrid Consttuction! God for∣bid I shou'd so much as suggest the People of <HI>Dartmouth</HI> had any Meaning in the least, either in that, or <HI>any other Part</HI> of their Address, the rest being equally ridiculous.</P>
<P>In these necessary and useful Observations, it may not be amiss to confront Two or Three
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
of our late Addresses with one another, wherein the Impossibility of reconciling the Contraries, and bringing the Extreams on both Sides to meet <HI>any other Way,</HI> than by their having <HI>No Meaning,</HI> or Signification in them; may abun∣dantly prove the Usefulness of the Construction now put upon them; and will, no Doubt merit for us the Thanks of the Gentlemen on both Sides, for finding so clear a Door of Escape to them, from the Scandal and Reproach which the <HI>Whiggs,</HI> and <HI>Dissenting Hereticks</HI> would otherwise load them with, and which they have no other Way to avoid.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For Example.</HEAD>
<P><HI>The City of</HI> Hereford <HI>in their Address to the Queen cited before</HI> P. <HI>25. They tell Her Majesty of</HI> The Damnable Doctrine of <HI>RESISTANCE,</HI> The dis∣mal Consequences of which Your Majesty's Royal Grand-Father of Ever-Blessed Memory <HI>(not Her Father by the Way)</HI> and these Realms have been too fatally sensible of.</P>
<P><HI>The Loyal Town of</HI> Minehead, <HI>in</HI> Somerset-shire <HI>go another Length, They say,</HI> They declare, they detest, and abhor such a Factious and Ridiculous Notion, as that of <HI>RESISTANCE,</HI> a Notion ridiculous in its Nature, inconsistent with Reason and Scritpure, tho' in Cases of <HI>TYRANNY and OP∣PRESSION. Seethe Clause of this Address cited before,</HI> P. <HI>28.</HI></P>
<P>Now confront these Gentlemen, with the Right Reverend, and Reverend, the Clergy of <HI>London</HI> in their Address;—wherein We have a most Glorious Recognition made to the Doctrine of <HI>Resistance,</HI> not in their own Names only, but in the Names of all the Clergy of <HI>England</HI> in the
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
following Words, being Part of their Address to Her Majesty, <HI>August</HI> 26, 1710. <Q>“”We thank God from the Bottom of our Hearts, for the Legal Provisions made to secure us from <HI>Po∣pery</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> which WE ONCE, thro' the Divine Assistance, <HI>Vigorously,</HI> and <HI>Successfully</HI> WITHSTOOD, when they were breaking in upon our Constitution;—Nor shall WE FAIL, to manifest an equal Zeal against them, <HI>whenever,</HI> and by <HI>what Means soever,</HI> they shall meditate a Return.</Q></P>
<P>There is no Question to be made, but that these Addresses import great Contrarieties and Contradictions, and that some People might be so ill natur'd,—as to oppose them literally one against another, and <HI>in some,</HI> one Part against another, in Hopes, that by their direct Contra∣riety both Sides might be exposed.</P>
<P>For Example. <HI>They say,</HI> that when the City of <HI>Hereford</HI> tells the Queen, <HI>That the dismal Consequence of</HI> Resistance <HI>were felt by Her Grand-Father,</HI> but leave out the Resistance felt by Her Father: They acknowledge themselves partial in the Case, and that the latter would be directly against them, since 'tis evident, one was as much resisted as t'other:—And when they call <HI>Resi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance</HI> a <HI>Damnable Doctrine,</HI> they fly in the Face of the <HI>London</HI> Clergy's Address; where 'tis own'd in express Terms, and given as the profest Judgment of all the Clergy of the Kingdom. Nor would they be less ill natur'd in confronting the <HI>London</HI> Clergy in their Address with the Town of <HI>Minehead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Town of</HI> Minehead <HI>says, Resistance is a</HI> Factious and Ridiculous Notion, Ridiculous in its Nature, and Inconsistent with Reason and Scripture.
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
<HI>Nay, tho' the Pretences for it were</HI> Tyranny <HI>and</HI> Oppression.</P>
<P><HI>Oppose to this the</HI> London <HI>Clergy,—who first</HI> Thank God from the Bottom of their Hearts for the Legal Provisions made against <HI>Popery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitra∣ry Power,</HI> (viz. <HI>That the Subjects may with∣stand them.)—Then they boast, that</HI> by the Divine Assistance they did, vigorously and successfully, withstand; <HI>(that is, RESIST) THEM▪</HI> when they were breaking in upon them; <HI>that is, when their King was setting both up upon them: And they promise, they will</HI> not fail to do so again, whenever, <HI>and by WHAT MEANS SOEVER, that is,</HI> whether by Her Present Majesty, or any of Her Royal Successors, <HI>they should meditate a Return.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>we say,</HI> is a fair and genuine Construc∣tion of the Words, neither will they admit of any other.</P>
<P>Also, <HI>they say,</HI> this is a direct Contradiction, to what they had themselves said before in the same Address; <HI>viz.</HI> where they tell the Queen, Her Majesty's Authority is IRRESISTIBLE, which some, (still more critical,) say, if constructively taken, is inconsistent with the last Part of the same Address; and if literally taken, is inconsistent with Sence.</P>
<P>But our new System will clear up all this Mist, and extricate, not only the <HI>London</HI> Cler∣gy with their <HI>Resistance,</HI> and the <HI>Herefordshire</HI> Men with their <HI>Damnable Doctrine;</HI> but the <HI>Minehead</HI> Men too, who say, 'tis <HI>Ridiculous, against Scripture, and Reason,</HI> to Resist, even <HI>Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Oppression.</HI>—All this, I say, is reconcil'd, and made easy to the World, by the Great Do∣ctrine of NO-MEANING; and Nothing can be more to their Advantage, than to say that, all
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
these Gentlemen, laying aside the useless Bur∣then of Thought, as a Thing to no Purpose (at any Time) concern'd in Business of this Nature, had <HI>no Manner of Meaning</HI> in any Thing they said, and ought upon all such Occasions to be so understood.</P>
<P>Away flies all the ill-natur'd Suggestion of Want of Manners to the Queen, Prevarica∣tions in Fact, Rhodomontade in Expressions Self-Contradictions, Inconsistency, and every other Exceptions, which either in Reason, in Divinity, or in Politicks, would unanswe∣rably lye against them: For he that means <HI>Nothing,</HI> can have <HI>Nothing</HI> said against him; <HI>Nothing</HI> said for him; and <HI>Nothing</HI> said to him; but that he signifies <HI>Nothing;</HI>—and this is the Sum of the Matter.</P>
<P>It might be thought a necessary Enquiry here, after all that has been said about <HI>Mean∣ing,</HI> and <HI>Not Meaning;</HI>—what can these Poor People say for themselves, or what can their Friends say for them, if they would be so foolish, as to suggest, that really they had <HI>some</HI> Meaning in these Things?</P>
<P>What can the Addressors in the Country think of the Addressors in the City? When One says, <HI>Resistance on any Pretence whatsoever is utterly Illegal;</HI> and the Other says, <HI>They bless God, they have practised it with Success already, and will do so again:</HI> What can the Towns-Men of <HI>Minehead</HI> say to the Clergy of <HI>Lon∣don?</HI> but that in the Terms of their West-Country Loyalty, the <HI>London</HI> Clergy have set up a ridiculous Notion, ridiculous <HI>in its own Nature,</HI> and <HI>inconsistent with Reason and Scripture;</HI> and that they have acted ridiculously, and against Reason and Scripture, when they vigorously <HI>with∣stood</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
<HI>Arbitrary Power;</HI> for that it is <HI>ridiculous, and inconsistent,</HI> either with <HI>Reason</HI> or <HI>Scripture</HI> to do so, tho' the Cause should be TYRANNY and OPPRESSION.</P>
<P>Again, if the Clergy of the City of <HI>London</HI> had any Meaning in all this, which their Friends hope they have taken Care to be clear of;—but if, I say, they should, to their Misfortune, acknowledge to have meant what they said,—what Answer can be given for them to the following Questions.</P>
<P N="1">1. What Coherence, or Agreement has the said Address with the general Bent of their Sermons, and the Language of the Pulpit in the Churches of this City? and with the Ser∣mons afterward printed, in which, the Ille∣gality of Resistance, even of Arbitrary Power it self, is so strenuously asserted, that one would have thought it impossible, the same Clergy, when in a Body, could so directly contradict in their collective Sense, what they had said in their seperate Stations in the Pul∣pit?—Dr. <HI>Higgins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hillia—d,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mil∣bourn,</HI> and others, are Eminent Witnesses to the Doctrine of Non-Resistance, and yet here they are for blessing God, for their having suc∣cessfully put the contrary in Practice.</P>
<P>If this can be accounted for upon any Foundation, other than that of having <HI>No Meaning,</HI> we would be glad to hear it.</P>
<P>It is true, here may arise a Dispute, whe∣ther the Gentlemen may not be said to have some Meaning in one, and none in the other; <HI>viz.</HI> some Meaning in their Sermons, and none in their Addresses; or some Meaning in their Addresses, and none in their Sermons.
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
But we are loth to have this Point debated, because they may run the Risque of being found, to have no Meaning in either; or if not, it may be worse; <HI>viz.</HI> that the Meaning lyes in the Address, and not in the Sermon, and that when they came together, (like <HI>Balaam)</HI> they <HI>went with a wicked Design to curse</HI> Israel, but were forced by the over-ruling Spirit of God to bless them: So that they had design'd to have talk'd their old Jargon, and really began it, when they told the Queen, Her Majesty's <HI>Authority was Irresi∣stible.</HI>—But Truth prevailing, they were forced by an involuntary secret Constraint <HI>from Hea∣ven,</HI> to pay their Homage to the Constitu∣tion, and not only recognize the Justice of Withstanding their Prince, but boast of the Practice, and engage themselves to continue in it.</P>
<P>How else could those Ministers set their Hands to this Address, and wait upon the Queen with it, kiss Her Majesty's Hand, &amp;c. who have from the Pulpit told us it was a Dam∣nable, Heretical, Republican, Schismatical Te∣net, that Subjects might resist their Sovereign, upon any Pretence whatsoever.</P>
<P>This Way of taking it, therefore, being much more to the Disadvantage of our Friends, the Clergy of <HI>London:</HI> It seems much kinder, and more to their Advantage, to prove, that in all these Things (as before) they have not been in the least inrected with any Meaning at all:</P>
<P N="2">2. But another Question falls in here, to which, in Point of Reputation, and for the Honour of the Clergy, something should be said, (to wit) where the Manners and good Breeding of put∣ting these Things upon the Queen is to be found?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64"/>
But this is answer'd several Ways, it is true, all reasonable just Deference and Respect, is in Duty to be paid to the Queen, the Head of this Great Body, and especially, as Her Ma∣jesty has been the Great, and Liberal Bene∣factor to the Clergy; and, no Doubt, the Gen∣tlemen of the Clergy have a very great Sense of Duty and Regard in this Case:—But the Duty and Regard to our Sovereign however great, is no where supposed to exceed our Du∣ty and Reverence to God Himself, who is still superior, not only to the Queen, but to all the Kings and Queens on Earth.</P>
<P>Now the Queen can by no Means take it ill, tho' it shou'd appear Her Majesty has been a little trifl'd with, since the same Treatment has by the same Persons been given ev'n to God Himself,—and this many Ways; such as Preaching up the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of the Line of Princes, the inherent Right of the Person of the King, the Superiority of a Tyrant to the Law, and the Authority of Temporal Power over the Conscience.—Such is the absolute Subjection of Subjects to the Lust, and Fury of the most Wicked and Atheistical Princes; and the like; Things that are all but Jests in their own Nature, and in venting which in the Pulpit, they know they insult Heaven, re∣proach Religion, and banter their Maker.</P>
<P>Now, the Queen cannot expect they shou'd treat Her better than they do the King of Kings; or, that Her Majesty shou'd be above their Mockery, when their Maker is not. It is evident, that in all their Pretences to ab∣solute Subjection, they have banter'd both God and their Kings. Poor King <HI>James</HI> found it to his Destruction, since none were so forward
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
vigorously to withstand his Arbitrary Govern∣ment, as those that prompted him to that ve∣ry Lawless Power <HI>(hoping to have a Share in it)</HI> upon their Faithless Promises of Submitting to it.</P>
<P>But if Her Majesty shou'd, notwithstanding this, take it ill, that these Gentlemen use Her thus, there is another Thing to be spo∣ken in their Favour, which is hoped may be accepted as an Excuse; <HI>viz.</HI> That it has been the known Usage, and Custom of Addressing,—and that 'tis hoped Her Majesty will not re∣sent it, since it has of old, even from the Days of Her Royal Uncle, and Father, been the Practise of these People, to talk a Lan∣guage in their Addresses, on which no Reliance can be made, and to which no Heed shou'd be given.—That Her Majesty's Ancestors have been us'd thus all along, but never thought fit to resent it:—And so it may be hoped, the Goodness and Mercy of this Reign will bear with the Follies, which have so long a Prescription to plead for the Practice.</P>
<P>To make it out, that there is abundant Occasion for the Royal Forbearance, I shall give but one Instance more than what is al∣ready noted, and that is in the following Address from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> which, I shall give you at large, because it merits more than Common Notice, and seems to be the only Address, that has any Meaning in it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Humble Address of the High-Sheriff, Grand-Jury, Justices of the Peace, Clergy, Gentle∣men, and Freeholders of the County of <HI>Salop,</HI> at the Assizes held for the said County, the Third Day of <HI>August, 1710,</HI> in <HI>Shrews∣bury.</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q>“”WE Your Majesty's most dutiful Subjects being deeply affected with that Re∣proach, undeservedly cast upon our Country, by a Representation laid before Your Maje∣sty in <HI>April</HI> last, whereby divers of Your Majesty's Faithful Subjects are unjustly tra∣duc'd with the Promoting of Tumults, and Disturbing the Publick Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”We beg Leave to acquaint Your Majesty, that the Representation was false and ground∣less, and maliciously compos'd, and design'd to draw down Your Majesty's Displeasure upon us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Since we have thus presum'd to approach Your Sacred Majesty, we shall take this Op∣portunity, of Expressing our utmost Resent∣ment of the Vile, and Jesuitical Doctrine of <HI>Resistance,</HI> which has of late been so inso∣lently asserted in the most Publick Manner.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”A Doctrine destructive to Monarchy, and all Civil Government: A Doctrine, which brought Your Royal Grand-Father to the Block, the Guilt of which Horrid Fact still goes heavy upon this Nation, and will be felt by distant Posterity.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="67"/>
<Q>“”And that Your Majesty may be assur'd, the Address, we humbly offer, is not obtain'd in a clandestine and unusual Manner, but that we speak the Sence of our Country; whensoever Your Majesty (in Compassion to Your People) shall be pleas'd to call a New Parliament, WE WILL send such Repre∣sentatives, as WILL act with an UNLI∣MITED OBEDIENCE to Your Maje∣sty's Authority, with Justice, and Regard to the Liberties and Franchises of their Fel∣low-Subjects, with a due Tendency to Con∣sciences Truly-scrupulous, with a firm Reso∣lution of continuing the Succession in the Protestant Line, and the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law establish'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”May the Almighty long continue Your Majesty's Reign over us, may He more and more confirm, and strengthen Your Majesty in the Virtues of Prudence, Justice and For∣titude, (with which the Crown is already so richly adorn'd) and may Your Majesty partake of all the Blessings, to which these excellent Virtues lead both in, and after this Life.</Q></P>
<P>After all that has been said of our Ad∣dressors having no Meaning, I hope, no Man will suspect the Authors of the above, to pretend to more Wit than their Neigh∣bours; especially, because, while they cloath them with Sence, they must strip them of Honesty.</P>
<P>I cou'd be merry a little with the Gentle∣men on <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> Side, by telling them the many Steps they have taken, to single out a Set of Men from the whole County, who
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
they might depend upon for Men of no Mean∣ing: Whether they chose them from the De∣monstrations given in their Mobbing, and Huzzaing a detected Criminal, who vain of his Influence upon the Nation's Folly, went about the Country to let wise Men see who were the Fools in the Neighbourhood; or, whether the Gentlemen gave any other particular Marks of their extraordinary <HI>Want of Meaning,</HI> I will not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>However, since it was necessary, that the County of <HI>Salop</HI> should appear as fruitful of <HI>F—s</HI> as other Places, and something must be brought up, to make the World merry with; the diligent Party, who have taken much Pains to expose themselves, have rumag'd the whole County, <HI>Parturient Montes,</HI> great was the Travel of the Party, and now, <HI>Ridiculus Mus!</HI> they are deliver'd.</P>
<P>And what is the Substance of this Address, let any one but read the Contents: <HI>First;</HI> Whereas by a late Letter of a Noble Person to the Government, and an Answer from the Secretary of State, by the Queen's express Command, Her Majesty was inform'd, that the Gentlemen of the County of <HI>Salop,</HI> notwithstanding the Endea∣vours of a Party to bring them into Mobs, Tu∣mults, and disloyal Practises, were yet loyal, peaceable, and sensible of their Duty to Her Majesty, and the Good of their Country.—This Address tells Her Majesty, 'tis all false, the Fact is not so, and they are quite another Sort of People.</P>
<P>Did these People <HI>mean any Thing,</HI> a Man would expose them a little for it; but as the Certainty of having no other Meaning in it, than Folks use to have in like Cases, as
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
has been noted, is evident; so, I shall content my self with giving the short History of what was done before, that the Reader may under∣stand, how necessary 'tis to these Gentlemens Reputations, that we should conclude they meant nothing at all in it; and that they may them∣selves be very sensible, how kind such a Con∣struction is, and how much in their Favour.</P>
<P>The Letter to my Lord <HI>Bradford,</HI> and which my Lord sent up to the Queen, is, as follows, together with the Answer to it from the Lord <HI>Sunderland,</HI> then Secretary of State, by Her Majesty's Command.</P>

<HEAD>A Letter to the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Bradford,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of the Coun∣ty of <HI>Salop.</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q>“”YOUR Lordship's Absence from this Coun∣ty, occasioned by your Attendance in Parliament, obligeth us to transmit to your Lordship the following Account.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”The Affidavits annexed, and whereto we crave Leave to refer your Lordship, contain a Representation of certain Facts, which have happen'd on Friday the 31st of <HI>March</HI> last, (being the Commission-Day for holding the Assizes of this County) and during the Assizes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”We are very sensible of the evil Ex∣ample, and dangerous Tendency of such Tumultuous Proceedings at all Times, but more especially, when the Respect due to Her Majesty's Authority, and those Commis∣sioned by Her, for the Administration of
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
the Publick Justice, makes it incumbent on all Persons, and more particularly, on those in Authority, not to encourage, but to pre∣vent such Disorders.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”But we consider those Seditious Practices, with greater Indignation, because they ap∣pear to us, intended as a Publick Reflection on the late Proceedings in Parliament a∣gainst Dr. <HI>Henry Sacheverell,</HI> and such Mem∣bers of the House of Commons, who appear'd in the Service of the House on that Occa∣sion; and were meant to Abett, and Justify the dangerous Tenets, which have been vented by that Person, so highly to the Dis∣honour of Her Majesty's Government and Administration, and which have received the Just Condemnation of both Houses of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Your Lordship will find by the Certifi∣cate and Assidavit annex'd, that one <HI>Thomas Yewde,</HI> who was concern'd in the said Tu∣multuous Proceedings, hath since that Time refused to take the Oaths to the Govern∣ment.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”We take Leave to inform your Lordship further, that during our Attendance at the Assizes, some of us received Intimation of a Design of some Persons concerned in the be∣fore-mentioned Tumults, to procure an Ad∣dress to Her Majesty; but the Sense of the Majority of the Gentlemen who served on the Grand Jury, and who attended at the Assizes, being well known to be very op∣posite to all Seditious Attempts, no such Address was publickly tendred to the Grand Jury, in the Manner, wherein such Solemn Transactions, really intended for the Honour

and Service of the Government, and Peace of the Kingdom, have been usually done.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”But since the Grand Jury have been dis∣charged, and some of them gone out of Town, an Address hath been carried about this Town, to many Publick Houses about Ten a Clock at Night, in Order to procure Hands to it.</Q></P>

Lordship should let the Gentlemen, who sent you these Papers, know, how graci∣ously She accepts this so seasonable Mark of their Loyalty, and Zeal for Her Person and Government, of which She desires their Continuance, in their going on to suppress such Practices, by which the Publick Peace is broken, and which tend to nothing less than the total Subversion of our present Con∣stitution; and that it is Her Majesty's Plea∣sure, they should effectually prosecute the Offenders with the utmost Severity of Law. Her Majesty, from what these Gentlemen have already done, does not doubt of their ready Compliance with these Her Com∣mands, and is fully perswaded you Lord∣ship will not be wanting to encourage them in it, by giving them all the Countenance and Assistance in your Power.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="73" REF="74"/>
Now of all the Addresses that have been presented to the Queen this is the merryest; whether you compare it with it self, or with o∣ther Addresses.</P>
<P>To compare it with it self, it tells you, That the Representation giv'n of them in the Late Letters were <HI>false and groundless;</HI> First, that it traduc'd divers of Her Majesty's Faithful Sub∣jects with the Promoting Tumults; and then goes on to say, this was <HI>Maliciously compos'd to draw down the Queen's Displeasure;</HI> upon who? upon <HI>ƲS,</HI> says the Paper: Now who are these <HI>ƲS?</HI> If they are the People before-nam'd, that, 'tis depos'd upon Oath, did attempt to raise Tumults; what merry Fellows they are, to come to the Queen with their single Nega∣tive against the Affidavits sent up, with the Truth of which Her Majesty was so well sa∣tisfy'd, and which besides was attested by Ten Gentlemen, whose Names we have at the End of the Representation aforesaid.</P>
<P>Again, If this Address is done by the same Parties that were accus'd before, then why do they not clear themselves, of the Charge of Clan∣destine Procuring Hands to an Address, by Go∣ing up and down in the Night to get Hands, after the Grand-Jury was discharg'd; of this they do not think fit to say one Word, and consequently do not deny the Fact in the least.</P>
<P>But if they are not the same People, then how does this mighty <HI>ƲS</HI> come in:—This is sad Stuff to come from a County, and stands upon Record against their Worships being in their Sences, at the Time of their Framing this Address.</P>
<P>Well, tho' they do seem to allow this Charge, and that they did go about Clandestinely, to
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
get a Former Address sign'd in the dark, know∣ing, that as a Body, it con'd not be obtain'd; yet <HI>they are clear in this,</HI>—and <HI>how do they think to satisfy Her Majesty, that they are so clear;</HI> why, truly, by Telling Her Majesty they will elect <HI>such</HI> and <HI>such</HI> for Parliament Men. This is such a Demonstration, as no doubt, Her Majesty will be satisfy'd of when She sees it:—And what are they, that they will elect? Truly, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>WILL</HI> elect such as <HI>WILL</HI> act with an <HI>ƲNLIMITED OBEDIENCE.</HI> Nobly done!—They will choose such, as shall give up the Constitution if it be demanded; For what else can <HI>Ʋnlimited Obedience</HI> signify?—But then see the Cheat too: To come off of the Wicked∣ness of the Thing, they fall into Nonsence; <HI>Ʋnlimited Obedience, with Regard to the Laberties and Franchises of their Fellow-Subjects.</HI>—What Jargon is this! Is it <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Welsh? Ʋnlimited Limited Obedience,</HI> just like the Clergy of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> withstanding <HI>Irresistible Power.</HI></P>
<P>Now can these People <HI>MEAN?</HI> Would it not be Horrid Nonsence, to suppose such Stuff as this can have <HI>any Meaning?</HI> Nothing, but the Certainty of their having <HI>No Meaning</HI> can make the Thing tolerable; or excuse them in good Manners.—Bless us! That People shou'd talk thus to the Queen, and Printing it afterwards talk it to the World.—</P>
<P>And is this the Proof, that their Address was not Clandestinely obtain'd! Is this all they have to say upon that Head? We shall see what will be the Weight of this Proof, when their Representatives come up.—I dare say, neither of their Knights of the Shire, let them choose who they will, can have the good Coun∣tenance to say in the Parliament-House, <HI>That</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
<HI>they are come up to act with an</HI> Unlimited Obe∣dience <HI>to Her Majesty.</HI> It is not Parliament Language; it does not suit with the Usage of the Crown it self; ev'n the Queen Her Self, does not seek such Obedience from any of her People, nor can just Monarchs accept it.—But to talk of <HI>Ʋnlimited Obedience,</HI> and then add to it <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Franchises,</HI> this is such Stuff!—Alas! When Obedience is to be Unlimited, Farewel Liberties, Farewel Fran∣chises; there are no such Things left in Nature, the Words cannot stand together:—Tis to say <HI>Dry Water,</HI> or <HI>Cold Fire:</HI>—'Tis like <HI>South-North,</HI> or <HI>East-West.</HI>—In short, like the great∣est Part of the Address, it is Fulsome, Incorri∣gible Nonsence.</P>
<P>But <HI>now,</HI> bring them among their Neighbours, and only acknowledge for them that they had <HI>no Meaning,</HI> you bring them off <HI>as round as a Hoop,</HI> and they may tell you boldly, they are no greater—s than their Brethren.</P>
<P>It wou'd be endless, to go thro' with all the Nonsence and Inconsistency, that these Gentle∣men fill up these Things call'd <HI>Addresses</HI> with. The great Use I shall make of them is, that you may see the Doctrine of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> is in it self so ridiculous, so self-contradicting, so in∣consistent, that the Wisest Men in the Na∣tion cannot put it together, so as to make it speak Sence.—They that in other Cases speak clear and explicite, that are Masters of the Tongue, and other Tongues too; that write a Fluent, Easy, Copious Stile, Strong in Sence, Flowing in Eloquence, and Rich in the Beau∣ties of Conception, when they come to this, when they have these Incongruities to put to∣gether, how do they chew it, and mumble it
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
like an Ass upon Thistles; and when it is di∣gested with all the Art and Cunning they can employ upon it; behold it comes out most In∣comprehensible Nonsence.</P>
<P>This Doctrine needs no Application.—It may serve for an Instruction to the World, in the Difficult Work of Defending these Gen∣tlemen in their Common Conversation; <HI>viz.</HI> That the good People <HI>mean nothing at all,</HI> and consequently can mean no Harm.</P>
<P>And now can any Man do better, than to recommend to the Good People of <HI>England,</HI> the Choosing their Representatives out of these honest <HI>Nothing-Meaning</HI> Gentlemen, That we may have a Parliament of such Men, who will act by an <HI>Ʋnlimited Limited Obedience,</HI> and <HI>resist Irresistible Authority:</HI> No Question it wou'd be much for the Advantage of the Kingdom at such a Time as this, that the Enemy may be effectually reduc'd, the War vigorously carry'd on, and <HI>France</HI> gallantly beaten; for Fools, they say, always fight desperately, and no Men have more Courage than some of those that never think.</P>
<P>But after all, when we come to consider more seriously, we cannot but put the Good People in Mind, that these are not the People that will do their Business.—Men to repre∣sent their Country, and to serve Her Majesty in Parliament, must be Men of Meaning, Men of Sence, Men of Abilities of Mind, Men of Moderation, Men of Temper.</P>
<P>Men, that know how to give a due Obe∣dience, and pay all the just Duty of faithful Subjects; but yet know how to maintain, and preserve the Liberties of their Country; that know how to keep both the Prerogative of the
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
Sovereign, and the Priviledges of the Subject in a due Consistency one with another, that both may flourish, and be maintain'd in their full Vigour, and a due State of Health, that will neither trample upon the Crown, nor give up the Constitution. These are the Men, that we should recommend to the Free-Holders at this Time, that would heal, and restore this divided, distracted People.</P>
<P>Nor is this Advice contrary to the Mean∣ing, and true Design of Her Majesty in this Dissolution.</P>
<P>The Queen desires to have such Men sent up, Men of Temper and Moderation, Men of Probity and Honour, Men, that would cool our Heats, and remove the Cause of our Breaches, that the Effect may cease of course. I may venture freely to say, whoever thinks Her Majesty desires a Parliament hot, reveng∣ful, quarrelsome and furious, they mistake Her Royal Design, and in the grossest Manner vilify and abuse their Sovereign.</P>
<P>Nor can the New Ministry, which are now put into the Publick Offices of Trust, be sup∣posed to desire it; Fools, or Mad-Men will by no Means do their Work, it must be Men of Sense, Men of Temper, and Men of Con∣duct, that must support the Government, and must support them in the Administration of it. These only can prevent the wild Ex∣treams, that some People are driving at.</P>
<P>Thus, the Queen, the New Ministry, the Old Ministry, and indeed, all honest Men a∣gree in this, that the Interest of the Free-Holders of <HI>England</HI> at this Time, and indeed, at all Times, is to be represented by wise, so∣ber, judicious Men, whose Zeal is temper'd, and
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
guided by Knowledge, Wisdom and Love to their Country, whose Moderation is distinguish'd upon known Occasions, as who are qualify'd to cool, and restore our Native Country over∣whelmed with Faction, and Furious Parties.</P>
<P>Let such Men be sent to represent us, and no Matter who comes in, or goes out of Places; the Queen will be enabled to act vigorously, and counselled wisely; and this is the Way to make us all happy.</P>
<P>All the rest tends to Confusion and Disorder, and must end in the Destruction not of the Na∣tion's Peace only, but the Nation it self; must ruin the Constitution, ruin the Queen, ruin the Subject, tends directly to the bringing in <HI>French</HI> Power upon us, and with it a Popish Pretender.</P>

<P>THE foregoing Sheets are the natural Con∣sequences of a most confused Heap of ri∣diculous Nonsence, the Effect of much Con∣fusion, which appears to be now on the Face of Things in this Nation.</P>
<P>What has been said is Ironical, and the true Design of it all, is to let us see, that really this tumultuous Way of Mobbing our Gover∣nours by Addresses, has no Manner of Good in it, but a great deal of Evil; and that as well to the Party they would serve, as to the Party they would oppose.</P>
<P>They are agreeable to no just Government, as well, because of the Feuds and Divisions they make in the Towns and Counties they come from, as because of the little Depen∣dance that is to be had upon them, the Persons addressing having seldom, if ever, been known to have the least Regard to them, when any pressing Occasion has given the Prince Reason to expect it, as is fresh in our Memories in the Case of <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and King <HI>James:</HI></P>
<P>If our Princes have depended upon this Me∣thod, they have been not mistaken only, but mistaken to their Hurt, as King <HI>James,</HI> without Doubt, was in a more particular Manner.</P>
<P>Again, They are generally worded in so ex∣travagant a Manner, either so surfeiting in Flat∣tery,
<PB N="80" REF="81"/>
so wild in Professions of Duty, so provo∣king upon the contrary Party, so ill worded in Matters of Law, and sometimes in Sence, that 'tis a hard Matter for the Prince, tho' He may like the Zeal of His Subject's Addressing, ever to forbear, either Smiling at the Extravagance, or Frowning at the Arrogance of the Address it self.</P>
<P>I cannot from hence but give it as my Opi∣nion, that had Her Majesty been asked, or, had any of Her Royal Predecessors been asked, their Opinion of the Custom of Addressing, especially as it hath been used in this Kingdom for some Years past, They would unanimously have an∣swer'd, They should be as well pleased it were all let alone.</P>
<P>If it could be done with Unanimity of Coun∣cil, and in Friendly Terms by the People, with Peace among themselves, Duty to their Sove∣reign, and due Regard to Bounds, in the Man∣ner; It would be agreeable enough to any Prince, to receive the Congratulations, and hearty Ex∣pressions of their Subjects Joy upon Occasions of Success, the Protestations of their Fidelity, and Zeal in National Exigencies, and the like: But to have Subjects Teizing their Sovereign with their wild Notions of Government, with their extravagant Systems of Obedience, compliment∣ing their Prince in the grossest and coursest Manner, off'ring Service which their Prince knows they will never pay.—Cloathing their Sovereigns with Power they do not pretend to, or desire to exercise, and promising a Submission to Burthens, they themselves cou'd never bear.</P>
<P>This can never be pleasant to a Prince, that knows any Thing of the Nature of Government, and the Temper of Subjects, especially of <HI>English</HI> Government and <HI>English</HI> Subjects.</P>

The Author no where designs in this, to lessen the Credit of the Testimonials any Part of the Country gives Her Majesty of their own Sin∣cerity and Fidelity; or to insinuate, that they, the Addressors, are not Loyal, Good Subjects; but when People talk in the Clouds, bluster, and rumble, speak a Language no Body can understand; and that they do not understand themselves, it merits to be a little expos'd; if it be only to instruct the honest Country People, what Language they ought to speak to their So∣vereign, and that when they make solemn Ad∣dresses to the Queen, they ought not to talk Nonsence, and Ridiculous Stuff, such as <HI>Resisting Irresistible Power, Ʋnlimited Limited Obedience,</HI> and the like; least the Queen shou'd be in Ear∣nest with their Jest, and take it ill to be talk'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to in a Language unbecoming even a Stage-Play.</P>
<P>But this is not all. This Ridiculous Manner of Addressing takes off all the Solemnity of the Thing, and by Consequence defeats the End of it. The Author of this professes, not to con∣cern himself with the pretended Design of these People, <HI>if they had any;</HI> and therefore, has turn'd it all upon that Point:—But really, the Man∣ner of these Addresses, the very wording them, is so incongruous, so un-harmonious, and lays them open to so much Banter and Ridicule, that it quite spoils all the rest; if any Expres∣sion of Duty is intended, it's quite blasted, and blown up by the Bluster and Rhodomontade it comes drest up in; if any Thing by Way of Re∣cognition of the Sovereign's Rightful Authority is intended, it's carry'd so far beyond all Claim any Prince on Earth ever made, that the Compliment is quite turn'd into a Banter.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83"/>
Can this be agreeable to a Monarchy, E∣stablish'd, <HI>as Our Queen thanks God this Monarchy is,</HI> upon the Laws of the Land? Can Her Ma∣jesty, with any Patience, hear these People pro∣mise to Obey, and Submit to Her, tho' She should turn Tyrant and Oppressor.—It cannot but offend Her Royal Ears, as Her Majesty never desires to Rule in that Manner, so She cannot desire to be so Obey'd. Her Majesty covets the chearful Obedience of Free Subjects, but not the Servile Submission of degenerate Slaves: Besides, Her Majesty knows they speak against their Sence, against their Temper, and against their Practice; they say, and promise to do, what they never did and never will perform.</P>
<P>What Pleasure then can the Prince take in such Addresses as these? To imagine the Queen would be pleas'd with them, would be, either to presume Her Majesty did not know when She was flatter'd and banter'd, or loved to be so; either of which would be very unmannerly.</P>
<P>Nor can I believe, the Manner of obtaining these Addresses, and the Consequences of them, contribute any Thing towards giving the Pub∣lick Ministers of the Government any Satis∣faction in them.</P>
<P>In the procuring them, we find terrible Ragings, Heats, Divisions and Animosities a∣mong the People: One Side opposing the other with all possible Fury and Artifice; sometimes two contrary Addresses from the same Place; To procure these all the Caballing, Bribing, Wheedling, Threat'ning, and in short, all the clandestine, corrupt Practices in the World, to get Hands crouded into an Address; when both Sides pretending to speak the Sence of the Place, all the Effect is, to let the Queen know,
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
the People of that Place are most horribly di∣vided, and no Body knows which Side was the strongest; for Hands to an Address seldom, if ever, are any Trial of the Strength of the o∣ther Parties.</P>
<P>Again, this can be of no Service to the Go∣vernment, and therefore, I am perswaded, our Ministers of State whether new or old, neither now do, or ever did, desire this tumultuous Way of Proceeding. It raises and maintains Factions in every Town and County, keeps up the Heats, and propagates the Party-Divisions, that are already come to too great a Head among us.</P>
<P>I make no Question, the present Ministry covet to cool, and bring to Temper the Heats, which the Court-Changes have raised among the People; I am sure, if they see their own Interest, I mean the Queen's Interest, they must desire it; it cannot be pleasant to them, to have such an Occasion of constant Feud put in the Way of the People.</P>
<P>Here one Side calls Rebel, Traytor, Facti∣ous, Antimonarchical, and Enemy to the Church; these again call the other Slaves, Betrayers of their Country, Raisers of Tumults, and Friends to the Pretender; and what's next to hard Words, but hard Blows; and who knows to what Excesses exasperated Parties may drive one another.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, that tends to embroil, to divide, and to exasperate the People One against Another, can be approved by the Go∣vernment, or the Ministry.</P>
<P>It may not be amiss to observe here, that the flocking about the Court with Addresses, seems to have an End, very differing from
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
what the Addresses themselves propose: For, in their Addresses, they make Tenders of the lowest Submission to the Pleasure, and perfect Resignation to the Authority of their Sovereign; and yet in the Language of their Addresses, pretend to lay great Stress upon the Opinion of the Subjects, and upon this, or that Address, being the Sense of the County, or the Sence of the Town they come from.</P>
<P>Now, if the Subject's Duty be an <HI>Ʋnlimited Obedience,</HI> as some of these extravagant People have pretended; the Matter of this, or that, being the Sence of the People, seems to be so entirely useless and insignificant, that it can∣not be nam'd with the rest; For what signi∣fies it, what the Subject's Sence is, if their Part consists only in an <HI>Ʋnlimited Submission.</HI></P>
<P>The next Thing which makes it seem, that these Addressings cannot be grateful to the Government, is, that they are of so many dif∣fering and inconsistent Parts, even tho' pre∣sented on the same Side, and from the same Parties: One gives up all Her Majesty's Claim to the Crown to Her <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> and calls all the <HI>Parliamentary Part</HI> a Conspiracy against Her Majesty's <HI>Title,</HI> and an Insolent Attempt to <HI>depose</HI> Her; another talks of <HI>Legal Provisions</HI> to exclude <HI>Papists:</HI> One talks of <HI>Indefeizible Title</HI> immediately from God, and others com∣pliment Her with the Peoples Acknowledg∣ment of Her Title by <HI>Descent.</HI></P>
<P>In the Matter of Government and Sub∣mission they contradict one another, and con∣tradict themselves; some talk of <HI>Absolute Obe∣dience,</HI> even to Tyranny and Oppression; and of the <HI>Illegality of Resistance on any Pretence;</HI> of the <HI>Nonsence of Resistance,</HI> of the <HI>Ridioulous∣ness</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
of it, of its being a <HI>Damnable Sin;</HI> while others say, they <HI>have resisted,</HI> and <HI>will resist again.</HI> Thus they torture their Sovereigns with their unintelligible Stuff, and make them∣selves, no Doubt, very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Can any one make us believe, that this is pleasant to Her Majesty, that it is any Way serviceable to the New Ministry, or agreeable to the Friends of their Interests—Were the good People unanimous in their Application, uni∣form in what they address about, and would they keep the Bounds of Duty, and Reason in the Manner, something might be; it would be, indeed valuable, and an Honour, as well as a Sa∣tisfaction both to the Government and to the So∣vereign; but it really seems to expose, rather than to serve Her Majesty and Her Administration, to have the People come thus in Fragments, and divided Parcels, with Papers stuff'd with such ridiculous Things that are not tolerable to hear.</P>
<P>I cannot, therefore, think of supposing Her Majesty is at all pleased at these Things; neither can I see they are at all calculated to render Her Service. Nonsence and Folly serves no Body; Prince or People.</P>
<P>As to Her Majesty's Interest, whether real or supposed; whether in the New Ministry, or the Old; whether in Parliament, or out of it; these Addresses seem to do it no Service at all.—If the Method of obtaining them were justifiable, the Language of them agreable to Sence, the Consequence of them Peace, and the Managing of them free of Disorders, Riots, and a Civil War among Neighbourhoods and Societies, some∣thing might be said, at least, to palliate and ex∣cuse them.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87"/>
Wise Ministers of State never covet Riots and Tumults, Breaches and Disorders among the People. Peace, United Submission to the Administration, and a due Obedience to the Laws, are the best Off'rings the People can make to them.—All Kinds of Distractions among the People, are, in their Degree, Un∣easinesses to every Government: And, there∣fore, whoever they are, that would perswade us, these Addresses, which 'tis manifest have fomented our Breaches, are grateful to the Mi∣nistry, or to the Queen, do to the utmost of their Power, expose, ridicule and jest with their Governours, banter the great Officers of the Court, and if they durst, would do the same to the Queen.</P>
<P>It is true, Her Majesty has receiv'd all these Addresses very graciously, the several Lords, and others, of Her Majesty's Council, and Con∣fidence, have concern'd themselves to introduce the Addressors to Her Majesty, and the Clowns, upon all these Occasions, have had the Honour to kiss Her Majesty's Hand. What can any one infer from hence?—the best Construc∣tion I can put upon it amounts to no more <HI>than this,</HI> that however foolish the Subject is, the Prince is <HI>good to all;</HI> as the Sun shines upon the Garden, and upon the Dung-Hill; or as the Rain and sweet Dews distill at the same <HI>Time,</HI> upon the barren Rocks, the salt Ocean, and the fruitful, flow'ry Meadows, where in the one they are entirely lost, in the other turn'd to Salt and Barreness, and in the last to a fruitful Solacing and Profiting Flavour.</P>
<P>Her Majesty, like a gentle Prince, mild to all, shows an undistinguish'd and nourishing Goodness to Her Subjects; bears with their
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
Follies and Infirmities, pities their Impertinen∣ces, and nothing can be inferr'd from hence, but that here Her Majesty answers <HI>not a Fool in his Folly;</HI> and there again, She <HI>answers a Fool in his Folly;</HI> both Sides address, both are accepted, both kiss Her Majesty's Hand; what is good, and well mean't in all, Her Majesty accepts; what is simple, ridiculous and impertinent in either, Her Majesty overlooks: And as She cannot know by the Addresses of the People, what to depend upon, or expect from them; so neither can they know, or judge by their Reception, what Her Majesty's real Sentiments of these Things are, nor indeed, is it neces∣sary they should.</P>
<P><HI>I must ask Pardon</HI> of all that are otherwise minded, <HI>for Leave to think</HI> from hence, that really these Addresses have no Tendency to any Good, that they are no Manner of Advantage, either to one Side or other, and this is as near Saying they have no Signification, as any Man can de∣sire I shou'd speak. What then can remain, but to exhort the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to leave off this simple, nothing-meaning Way of Pro∣ceeding; and to exhort those that look on, to take no Notice of them, lay no Stress upon them one Way or other.—Upon all Occa∣sions shew the Neglect that is due to them, and if no other Way can suppress the Practice, let them see, that to address▪ or not address, is so near the same Thing, that to mind them is to no Manner of Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>This would either</HI> put an End to the Thing, or cure it of the Distemper; it would either bring the People to leave off Addressing as a Thing of no Signification, and tending to no Advan∣tage one Way or another; a vain, empty, fruit∣less
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
Folly, that neither had any Effect to them that made the Address, or any Effect upon those they made them to.</P>
<P><HI>Or else,</HI> It wou'd restore Addressing to its usual Vertue and Signification, that the People addressing, might know how with due Solem∣nity, and in proper Terms to come before their Princes, not make Sport with their Superi∣ours, and Banter instead of Address them; That the Gravity and Majesty of the Thing may be preserv'd, and consequently it may meet with a due Respect and Regard; that they may depend upon what is spoken, as sincere, and well meant; and without Danger to themselves, might, believe their Subjects when they speak to them.</P>
<P>This wou'd bring Addressing to be, perhaps, in its kind useful again, and make it very ac∣ceptable to the Government; then Princes might make some Judgment from it, of the Meaning of the People, of the Sence of the several Parts from whence they came, and might know how to take Measures from them accordingly, which now, it would be the greatest Folly in the World to attempt.</P>
<P>I had thought, to have let you see some∣thing of the Opinion our Enemies have of these Things, and how ridiculous they make us look abroad; How the <HI>French</HI> look upon us as effectually fighting in this Paper-Combat, as if we were all in a Declar'd Open Civil War. It were worth Notice, to speak a little to what they promise themselves from our Follies of this kind; how they are prompted by these Things to carry on the War, and to run themselves to all Manner of Extremities in the Holding out, bouying themselves up with the Expectation;
<PB N="89" REF="90"/>
that these Follies must end in more Fatal Di∣stractions, and must produce something in their Favour.</P>
<P>Nor is this an unprofitable Reflection, if we were but in a Posture of Improving it as we might do:—What our Enemies rejoice at, we may very well think worth our While to enquire into; if our Divisions are their Hope, our Folly their Advantage, our Weakning their Strength, we may reflect, with a great Deal of Justice, upon what we are doing, least we give our Enemies a Light to see into our In∣side, where we cannot look our selves.</P>
<P>What can the <HI>French</HI> do, but laugh at our Madness, and flatter themselves with making their Advantage of it? when they hear that the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> are playing <HI>Bo-Peep</HI> with their Sovereign:—When they shall read the incongruous Nonsence of our Fawning Addres∣sors, how they please themselves with the Jingle of <HI>Ʋn-signifying Words,</HI> and go away pleased with a superficial <HI>THANK-YE,</HI> as if the Sim∣plicity of their Harrangue was receiv'd with Approbation, and they counted, what none in the Earth, but themselves, could ever suggest of them, <HI>WISE MEN.</HI></P>
<P>Do we see any of these Extravagancies a∣mong Foreign Nations? The <HI>French</HI> are as supple, as humble in their Obedience, and have given as good Evidences of their slavish Sub∣mission, as any People in the World could do, or, indeed, as any People in the World could do, or, indeed, as any Prince in the World can de∣sire Subjects to do.—Their Monarchs are Ab∣solute, and might expect from them Expressions of <HI>Passive Loyalty,</HI> as ridiculous as that <HI>Passive Loyalty</HI> it self can be; and, indeed, in <HI>France,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Language might have some Meaning in▪
<PB N="90" REF="91"/>
it: For where People are Slaves and Princes are Tyrants, such a Stile will bear a Reading, when in Nations born to Freedom it is meer Nonsence.</P>
<P>Yet even in <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> nay, not in <HI>Poland,</HI> or <HI>Russia,</HI> have you any Thing of these Follies to be seen; neither Prince or People think them of any Signification; the One does not accept them, the Other dare not offer them.</P>
<P><HI>No where,</HI> but in this Land of Liberty, is this Folly to be found; <HI>where,</HI> I think, the very Constitution renders it ridiculous, and the Na∣ture of the Thing makes it utterly contemp∣tible.—Where the Laws expose it as Criminal, and the Peoples Rights make it absurd. To talk here of <HI>Ʋnlimited Obedience,</HI> is to talk what no Body regards that hears it, and no Body believes that speaks it.</P>
<P>This is the Reason why these Sheets were written, the Author is far from Lessening the Duty, and Affection of the People to their Sovereign; but, for God's-sake, Gentlemen, if you will apply your selves to your Queen, do it in Terms Her Majesty may believe you serious in, and not in such, as must tell the Queen, that either you say nothing, and are a Sort of Mad-Men not to be regarded; or that you design to affront Her.—Pro∣mise nothing, but what you can perform, and what there may be Room to expect you will perform: Then there will be no Room for Exposing you, and your Addresses may have some Signification.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92"/>
To procure this happy Effect, either to bring our People to be out of Love with this Way of Fermenting their Tempers, and so to lay down the Thing altogether▪ or to bring them to mend their Stile, and word their Addresses so, as Her Majesty may not be led to pity them, and the rest of the People to laugh at them, this is the true Design of the present Undertaking, in which, the Au∣thor hopes, he cannot have given Offence, since he has not meddled with the Parties, only made a little merry with their Nonsence.</P>
