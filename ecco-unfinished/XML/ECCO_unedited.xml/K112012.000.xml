<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROV. XX. 21.</BIBL>
<Q>MY SON, FEAR THOU THE LORD AND
THE KING, AND MEDDLE NOT WITH
THEM THAT ARE GIVEN TO CHANGE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are this day assembled, to express our ab∣horrence
of an action which involved our
forefathers in <HI>guilt</HI> and <HI>infamy;</HI> and to depre∣cate
that vengeance, which, for such an unheard-of-crime,
may justly be inflicted on us their children.</P>
<P>As we look not for any resurrection of the <HI>body-politic,</HI>
and as in the future world there will be no dis∣tinction
of nations, but each individual will be re∣warded
according to his works—the guilt of nations
(if punished at all) <HI>must</HI> be punished in the <HI>present</HI> state.</P>
<P>That nations, as such, are capable of guilt, and that
they are, by consequence, liable to punishment, is the
doctrin of Scripture, and must be admitted by every
man who believes in GOD'S moral government of the
world.</P>
<P>That the punishment of nations may be delayed,
'till their iniquities be <HI>full,</HI> is likewise su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficiently ob∣vious.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="3"/>
That the guilt, which we now deplore, was <HI>in some
sense</HI> national needs no proof: the nation confesses it;
and every one knows that it was by a <HI>pretended</HI> national
authority, that the virtuous Sovereign was brought to
the block.</P>
<P>To prevent the iniquities of our fathers from being
visited on us, in a national manner; the <HI>only</HI> manner,
I apprehend, that the sins of the fathers are ever visited
on their children; it will be our wisdom to avoid their
ways, those ways which they pursued in attempting, by
violent methods, to <HI>reform the Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>It should seem then that I cannot better fulfil the
purpose for which I stand here, than by endeavoring to
persuade you “to fear the Lord and the King, and not
to meddle with them that are given to change.”</P>
<P>To this end, it is proposed to shew you that Civil
Government is the ORDINANCE OF GOD: and then
I shall point out the danger and the sin of making <HI>vio∣lent
innovations</HI> in any constitution of government
whatever, that has been long established, and to which
the people have been accustomed quietly to submit.</P>
<P>FIRST, the nature of man—the constitution of
his mind as well as of his body—shews clearly that his
Creator intended him for <HI>Society.</HI> No other animal is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent into the world in so <HI>helpless a condition</HI> as this <HI>Lord
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
of the Creation;</HI> naked, yet unfitted to bear the incle∣mencies
of the weather; necessarily requiring food, yet
utterly unable to procure it for himself.</P>
<P>Thus circumstanced, if destitute of parental protec∣tion,
<HI>few and evil</HI> would be the <HI>moments</HI> of his life.
Thus totally dependent must <HI>every</HI> descendant of
Adam be contented to remain during the period of in∣fancy
and childhood—in the more rigid climates, du∣ring
a much longer one.</P>
<P>When he arrives at that stage of life at which he may
be supposed capable, in some measure, to take care of
himself; should he separate from his parents, and
roam alone among the wilds, he might, perhaps, in the
more favorable regions of the globe, be able to support,
for a few years, a wretched existence;—But to render
life, in any degree, pleasant and desirable, many more
things are <HI>absolutely necessary</HI> than can possibly be pro∣vided
by the labor and ingenuity of an <HI>individual.</HI></P>
<P>Should this <HI>solitary</HI> man take, from the other sex,
such a help, as inclination might prompt him to seek,
or as accident might bring within his reach, by that as∣sociation
his <HI>hands</HI> would indeed be doubled, but so
would his <HI>wants</HI> too: in the <HI>rearing</HI> (for we speak not
of the <HI>education</HI>) of children, he would soon encounter
difficulties so numerous and so formidable, that the ut∣most
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
stretch of imagination cannot conceive him <HI>able,</HI>
if <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed,</HI> to overcome them.</P>
<P>But, suppose all these wants supplied, all these ob∣stacles
surmounted, and a <HI>family grown up.</HI> Suppose that
little community <HI>doing</HI> all that a single family is <HI>capable
of doing,</HI> towards supporting themselves, by gardening
and agriculture, by hunting and by a few cattle, casu∣ally
got and tamed; <HI>These</HI> occupations would engross
their <HI>whole</HI> time; leaving neither leisure nor inclination
for aught beside. Man's <HI>higher faculties</HI> would remain
unemployed and uncultivated; for those arts and sci∣ences
which are indispensibly necessary to teach men
how to use their nobler faculties, and to unfold their
reason, are not the growth of single families.</P>
<P>Hence, in such a state, man must remain a stranger
to religion and morality. He could have no knowledge
of the greatest and most beneficent of beings, by whom
he was created, and would little surpass, in ex∣cellence
or dignity, his brethren the beasts of the
forest.</P>
<P>That this is not a visionary theory is evident from
the history of the <HI>new</HI> world. When that immense
continent was first discovered, such of its inhabitants
as lived in disjointed independent families, or in very
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
small tribes, were exactly in this degenerate state,
strangers to all the arts, and to all the comforts, of
life, and, “without GOD in the world”, they carried
about with them scarcely any marks of humanity but
their <HI>form.</HI> In the <HI>kingdoms,</HI> where society was formed,
and a regular subordination established, the case was
far otherwise. The people were in a degree civilized,
they had some acquaintance with many of the <HI>arts,</HI> the
<HI>elegances,</HI> and even the <HI>luxuries</HI> of life. And altho' by
the <HI>nature</HI> of their governments, and their <HI>monstrous
idolatries,</HI> they were prevented from attaining to that
degree of knowledge and politeness which has been at∣tained
by nations upon whom “the sun of righteousness
hath arisen”, yet, when compared with the <HI>wandering
tribes</HI> around them, they were happy, intelligent, and
polite.</P>
<P>Now as that superiority in improvement could be
owing to nothing but the mutual aid <HI>afforded by society;</HI>
and as the human race, when out of society, degene∣rates
<HI>almost</HI> to the level of the brute-creation, SOCIETY
must undoubtedly be the state intended for man by his
Maker.</P>
<P>But society necessarily implies laws and subordina∣tion.
A number of men living together in a state of
absolute equality, and indulging each his own humor,
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
would form a confused rabble: instead of affording one
another mutual assistance, “every man would do what
is right in his own eyes;” every man would grasp at as
much as he could; and, in the general scramble, the
strong would destroy the weak.</P>
<P>In <HI>modern philosophy,</HI> the social affections hold a very
conspicuous place; and from the certain existence, and
supposed influence, of these affections, have torrents of
senseless declamation been poured forth in praise of the
<HI>state of nature;</HI> of that <HI>imaginary state</HI> in which, during
the early ages of the world, men are <HI>supposed</HI> to have
lived together, while every man was <HI>his own legislator.</HI></P>
<P>That there <HI>never was</HI> such a state as this, all the re∣cords
of antiquity, to which any credit is due (with the
books of Moses at the head of them) agree in assuring
us. That there <HI>never could have been</HI> such a state, is
almost self-evident.</P>
<P>For, tho' it cannot be denied that there is implanted
in the human heart A PUBLIC AFFECTION, which
makes even <HI>children</HI> delight in society; yet in minds un∣cultivated,
that public affection hath but little strength,
and is by no means sufficiently enlarged to comprehend
the <HI>whole species,</HI> or even <HI>many individuals.</HI></P>
<P>How far, for instance, does the public affection of a
low illiterate clown extend? <HI>Probably,</HI> not beyond the
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
limits of his own family, and nearest relations, <HI>certainly</HI>
not beyond the limits of the village or parish wherein he
resides: And when public affection opposes itself to
the principle of self-love, in every <HI>uncultivated</HI> mind,
in the high or low, it is always foiled in the contest.</P>
<P>Indeed, were mankind compounded of nothing but
<HI>pure intellect and public affection</HI>—or (such beings as they
are) did the interests of <HI>one</HI> never interfere with those of
<HI>another;</HI> they might, perhaps, even in SOCIETY, be
left to the guidance of their own reason, to the influ∣ence
of their own internal feelings.</P>
<P>But whilst man is a compound of <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>appetite<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
of <HI>public</HI> and <HI>private</HI> affections; and, much more, whilst
the interests of <HI>one</HI> man are so frequently <HI>opposed</HI> by those
of <HI>another,</HI> it is past dispute that positive laws are abso∣lutely
necessary to render society either <HI>comfortable</HI> or <HI>use∣ful;</HI>
and indeed to keep it together.</P>
<P>But laws, in the very idea of them, infer <HI>magistrates</HI> of
<HI>different orders,</HI> and of various powers; and, as it is im∣possible
to multiply powers to <HI>infinity,</HI> there must▪ in
every state, be some <HI>man,</HI> or <HI>body of m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> vested with su∣preme
and uncontroulable authority. This can only be
the <HI>legislature,</HI> to which all <HI>inferior</HI> and <HI>executive</HI> powers
must, of necessity, be subject; and to the decrees of
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
which every individual of the state is bound to pay obe∣dience,
as he values the <HI>blessings of society,</HI> and as he would
shun the <HI>horrors of anarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever therefore, in the wild sallies of imagina∣tion,
men of warm genius may have advanced in favor
of <HI>absolute liberty,</HI> and <HI>boundless freedo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> it must be plain
to every one (who can conceive the difference between
the cabin of a savage and a commodious house, between
a rude barbarian and an enlightened religious philoso∣pher,
between a people living wild in caves and woods,
and a nation in full possession of ease and affluence) that
<HI>government</HI> is the true and solid basis of <HI>rational free∣dom,</HI>
and the sole foundation of all that can be styled
dignity and happiness in this world.</P>
<P>But, whatever is essential to the happiness of man
must be agreeable to the will of GOD, who cannot be
imagined to have had any other view in creation than
the felicity of his creatures.</P>
<P>The absolute necessity of some supreme authority to
enact laws, and to punish the violators of them, is as
convincing a proof that <HI>civil government</HI> is a <HI>divine ordi∣nance,</HI>
as St. Paul's declaration to that purpose, in his
epistle to the Romans.</P>
<P>Particular <HI>forms</HI> of government (the force of which
depending little on the tempers of men we may deduce
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
from them consequences <HI>only not</HI> as certain and general
as from mathematical sciences) may be devised on <HI>earth;</HI>
and they may be different in different nations, but still,
let us attend to a most important distinction in this
matter, altho' <HI>forms</HI> of government may be of <HI>man's</HI> de∣vice,
<HI>so</HI> is not <HI>government itself;</HI> that is from <HI>above,</HI> for
“the most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men, and giveth them to whomsoever he will.”</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to trace government from its rude origin,
thro' all the stages of perfection and refinement of which
it is capable, is foreign from my purpose, and far be∣yond
the limits of the present discourse, neither shall I
waste your time in comparing the <HI>various forms</HI> of go∣vernment
existing in divers countries; and in a fruitless
endeavor to decide peremptorily which of them is <HI>best:</HI>
It is my business to proceed, under the direction of the
text, to shew the danger and the sin of making <HI>violent
innovations</HI> in any form that hath been long and quietly
established. “My son, fear thou the Lord and the
King, and meddle not with them that are given to
change.”</P>
<P>Altho' the wise man <HI>particularly</HI> specifies the <HI>King</HI> as
the power which, after GOD, it is our duty to fear; yet
it is not to be imagined that his prohibition against
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
“meddling with them that are given to change” is ap∣plicable
<HI>only</HI> to persons living under kingly governments.</P>
<P>The <HI>danger</HI> to be apprehended from <HI>innovations</HI> is as
great, perhaps greater, in popular than in monarchical
forms. No great and <HI>violent</HI> change can be effected in any
constitution, but by armed force; now should an abso∣lute
prince be slain, and the government be dissolved,
that form, being simple and uniform, may be <HI>instantly
restored</HI> by placing another monarch on the vacant throne.
But in a complicated constitution, consisting of various
parts, the least <HI>innovation</HI> (provided it be <HI>perceptible</HI> by
the people at large) will not fail to split them into a
thousand fierce and rancorous parties. If, while things
are in this state, the government be dissolved (which in
such cases is always to be dreaded) <HI>when</HI> or <HI>how</HI> it may
be restored, can be known <HI>only</HI> to HIM “who stilleth
the raging of the sea, and the madness of the people.”</P>
<P>Nothing human is absolutely fixed: nations, as well
as individuals, are progressive; and what was fit for the
last age, may not be proper for the next. Gentle alter∣ations
in the modes of government are, perhaps, un∣avoidable;
but great and violent innovations no <HI>indivi∣dual</HI>
is entitled to make. Indeed such alterations are
very <HI>dangerous</HI> to be attempted even by the <HI>legislature
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
itself,</HI> and if experience may be credited, much more <HI>ill</HI>
than <HI>good</HI> is ever to be expected from them.</P>
<P>The patrons of the proposed innovations may have
the <HI>best intentions,</HI> and yet, unless the <HI>whole community</HI>
should agree in sentiment as to its <HI>fitness or necessity,</HI> the
consequence of introducing it may too probably be <HI>fatal.</HI>
For the “beginning of strife—especially of political
strife—is as when one letteth out water;” at first it
runs in a gentle rill, but, by degrees, the rill swells into
a mighty torrent, that sweeps away every thing before
it.—</P>
<P>The usual pretence of those “who are given to
change” is to <HI>redress grievances,</HI> and to <HI>reform the con∣stitution.</HI>
One may, however, very safely appeal to the
experience of all ages and nations, nay, to the com∣mon
sense of all mankind, whether under the <HI>worst</HI> con∣stitution
with which we are acquainted, the people
<HI>in general</HI> can suffer any grievance equal to the miseries
of a civil war; and every <HI>violent</HI> innovation in the state
hath been and always will be attended by a civil war.</P>
<P>Nor are the horrors alluded to confined to the time
of the contest; by no means, for it hath been com∣monly
found that, after civil broils, a return of peace
hath not brought back with it <HI>freedom</HI> and <HI>happiness.</HI>
Not to insist upon the executions, proscriptions, and
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
confiscations which must inevitably take place, <HI>which∣ever</HI>
party prevails—it is hardly to be expected that, if
the Sovereign prove victorious, the <HI>grievances</HI> complained
of should be redressed; an unsuccessful rebellion ha∣ving
been ever found to strengthen the government it
intended to destroy; but, should success declare for the
popular party, the leader of that party, at the head of a
victorious army, may easily seize the supreme power,
and amply supply by <HI>force</HI> what he wants of <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, instead of finding their Constitution <HI>reformed,</HI>
the people will feel themselves enslaved by a <HI>military
tyrant;</HI> and perceive, when too late, that “the little
finger of the <HI>Protector</HI> of their liberties is heavier than
the loins of their lawful Sovereign”; that if the yoke
laid upon them <HI>formerly</HI> was heavy, that under which
they <HI>now</HI> groan is heavier; and that “if they were <HI>before</HI>
chastised with whips they are now scourged with scor∣pions.”
This is the <HI>natural,</HI> I had almost said the <HI>ne∣cessary,</HI>
issue of every insurrection against the Legislature.
The insurgents are not <HI>sure</HI> to obtain a better govern∣ment,
but they <HI>are sure,</HI> by overthrowing that which is
established, to engage their fellow-citizens in civil wars,
cabals, factions, and universal confusion; and to open
a door for the admission of those horrid evils in future,
upon pretences the most false and frivolous.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
The love of our country then opposeth the <HI>overthrow</HI>
of subordination, and indeed every thing conspires to
shew that it is neither <HI>safe</HI> nor <HI>lawful</HI> to “meddle with
them that are given to change.”</P>
<P>THIRDLY, If this <HI>general reasoning</HI> be not suffi∣ciently
clear, the matter now under consideration may
be <HI>illustrated</HI> by a short sketch of the origin of that re∣bellion
which made England “a reproach unto our
neighbors, and a scorn and derision to those that were
round about us.”</P>
<P>When the first James succeeded to the English throne,
our Constitution was very different from what it is at
present. The government was more arbitrary, the royal
prerogative less limited, and the liberties of the people
less accurately defined. The meetings of Parliament
were so precarious, and the <HI>Sessions</HI> so short, that when
men's eyes were directed upwards, in search of sovereign
power, the King <HI>alone</HI> was apt to strike them as the <HI>only</HI>
permanent magistrate invested with the whole authority
of the state.</P>
<P>Matters had gone on thus so long, that (by a great
majority of the nation) Monarchy absolute, simple,
and unmixed, was conceived to be the Government
of England; and Parliaments, consisting of the three
estates of the realm, were supposed to form <HI>only</HI> the <HI>orna∣ment</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
of the fabric, without being in any degree, <HI>essential</HI>
to its existence.</P>
<P>For more than a century before the accession of
James, all English Monarchs had uniformly claimed
the dispensing power, that of exacting forced loans and
benevolences, of altering the customs, and of creating
monopolies. And, be it remembered, that, during the
whole period of English history, strict obedience had
been required to <HI>proclamations</HI> as to <HI>laws.</HI></P>
<P>James, as was very natural, thought himself entitled
to exercise <HI>all</HI> the powers which his predecessors had ex∣ercised:
and, no doubt, esteemed it his <HI>duty</HI> to transmit
those powers to his son. Being, however, pacific and,
perhaps, timid also, he contented himself with an osten∣tatious
display, both in his speeches and writings, of all
that, by his prerogative, he <HI>might do,</HI> whilst in truth he
very rarely <HI>did</HI> any thing at all in matters of consider∣able
importance. These occasional stretches or exertions
of prerogative were commonly made too with so little
dignity, and, for want of political courage, they were so
frequently retracted, that they tended rather to <HI>dimi∣nish</HI>
than to encrease the power of the crown.</P>
<P>The long peace which was preserved during the reign
of James afforded men leisure, and a general increase of
knowledge gave them ability, to reason upon the nature
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
and design of government, and to enquire into the
foundation of that prerogative of which the Monarch
was continually boasting.</P>
<P>The more enlightened part of the nation were not
long occupied in political discussions, before they disco∣vered
that the constitutional assembly of the three
Estates, of Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal, and Com∣mons,
must have been instituted for some better and
higher purpose than merely to serve as an organ of the
royal will. Men became now intent upon ascertaining
the rights of the senate, and restraining the prerogative
of the crown.</P>
<P>The peaceable system of James afforded not any op∣portunity
for accomplishing these aims; and he never
deviated from pacific measures until the concluding
year of his reign: <HI>Then</HI> he was, in some sort, con∣strained,
by the clamors of his subjects, to enter into a
war with the most powerful kingdom in Europe. To
his son and successor he left the <HI>prosecution</HI> of that con∣test,
under a load of debt, and with an empty treasury.</P>
<P>Charles instantly summoned a Parliament, whom he
addressed with the utmost simplicity and cordiality. Se∣cure
in the affections of the Commons, with whom he
had lately become a favourite, he lightly mentioned his
need of a supply; not doubting but that a compe∣tent
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
one would be liberally and chearfully granted for
the prosecution of <HI>their own war.</HI></P>
<P>The young King, however, was soon convinced of his
mistake; for the Commons (having voted a supply, so
scanty, as to evince an intention rather to mock their
Sovereign than to support the war) instantly preferred a
complaint of grievances.</P>
<P>For this conduct they did not, perhaps, deserve much
blame. Their ancestors had tamely yielded to practices
and to precedents favorable to absolute monarchy: it
was therefore absolutely necessary to <HI>fix a choice,</HI> either
to abandon entirely the privileges of the people, or to
guard those privileges with barriers more firm and pre∣cise
than any hitherto provided by the Constitution.</P>
<P>With pleasure they beheld the King engaged in a fo∣reign
war, which could not fail to render him every day
more dependent upon his Parliament. It certainly was
natural, and in their opinion, allowable, to take advan∣tage
of Charles's situation, and to extort from him
concessions favorable to civil liberty.</P>
<P>However natural and justifiable these sentiments
might be in the Commons, it could not be expected
that the King should entertain the same ideas.</P>
<P>Educated heir apparent to a crown, the prerogative
of which had long been undefined, and almost unlimi∣ted,
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
he could not fail to consider this attempt to erect
<HI>new ramparts</HI> against his <HI>authority,</HI> as a violent and in∣defensible
innovation in the constitution. <HI>He</HI> had ex∣ercised
no authority—(he had not indeed had <HI>time</HI> or
<HI>opportunity</HI> to exercise any authority) which had not,
without complaint or murmur, been exerted by his pre∣decessors.</P>
<P>Charles well knew that the grievances of which the
Commons complained were not the effect of any error
in <HI>his</HI> administration—therefore to be thus deserted in
the commencement of his reign, and of a war into which
popular clamor had driven his father, could not but ap∣pear
to him cruel and deceitful. When he perceived, as
he soon did, that this desertion was a prelude to en∣croachments
upon his authority, and infringements on
his prerogative, he failed not to regard those aims as
highly criminal and traiterous.</P>
<P>Nor need we wonder at this; the love of power being,
in some sort, natural to the human mind; and few
men being disposed <HI>willingly</HI> to suffer any, but espe∣cially
inferiors, to wrest from them that influence to
which they suppose their right to be indisputable, how∣ever
it may be disputed.</P>
<P><HI>Possibly,</HI> it might have been well for the King and the
kingdom if attention had been paid to the complaints of
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
the Commons; but before any man <HI>blame</HI> a King (whom the venerable Archbishop Secker styles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his Sermon on 30th January, 1733.</NOTE> “a willing and
a patient martyr to the constitution”) for endeavor∣ing
to maintain <HI>unimpaired</HI> the prerogative of the Crown,
as he received it, let every reviewer of those turbulent
scenes lay his hand upon his heart, and say, as in the pre∣sence
of that GOD from whom no secret is hid, “that,
had <HI>he</HI> been in the same elevated station, he would have
acted differently.”</P>
<P>In vain hath it been objected that there are rights and
privileges <HI>unalienable</HI> from human nature; and that
upon <HI>these</HI> the Crown had long trampled: for, granting
the truth of this (which, however, is not self-evident) we
ask whether it was reasonable to expect that a young
King should, immediately after his accession, make
discovery of this truth, which had lain so long concealed;
or that, because he had <HI>not</HI> discovered it, he should, on
this account, be deserted by those who had hurried his
father into an expensive war?</P>
<P>The Commons, however, deaf to the solicitations of
their Sovereign, and regardless, it should seem, of the
glory of the nation, remained inflexible. Thus circum∣stanced,
it was <HI>natural,</HI> and who can say it was not <HI>wise,</HI>
for Charles to dissolve such an assembly? The next
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
which he called, as if the same men had every where
been returned, and as if no time had intervened between
the two parliaments, adopted the same principles, and
displayed the same views.</P>
<P>The third parliament at first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eemed to be actuated by
a more candid spirit, but events soon proved that, for
violent purposes, they had assumed the mask of mode∣ration.
Their <HI>petition of right</HI> having been granted, by
which as much liberty was secured to the subject, and
as much restraint was imposed on the Sovereign, as the
circumstances of the times, and the genius of the people,
could admit, there remained no longer any one <HI>real</HI>
grievance, of which the Commons could complain.</P>
<P>The constitution was now restored to its primitive pu∣rity;
and it was the indispensible duty of the represen∣tatives
of the people to support the Crown in the prose∣cution
of the people's war; in which they had unequi∣vocally
promised to adhere to the King with their lives
and fortunes.</P>
<P>Had such been their conduct, they would have justi∣fied
the highest pretensions to patriotism; they would
have deserved the applause of their contemporaries, and
the admiration of their posterity: But, alas! they had
other ends in view. Far from being satisfied with this
important concession on the part of the Crown, these
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
perverse men were only thereby encouraged to make new
demands, and such as, had they been granted,
would have entirely changed our ancient constitution
both in church and state.</P>
<P>The King, extremely provoked by a factious spirit
which he saw that nothing could satisfy, dissolved this
parliament likewise; and seeing no prospect of support
from his people (among whom the seeds of sedition had
been sown with a lavish hand) wisely made peace with
his foreign foes—altho' he had not been able to obtain
the object, for which his father had commenced, and he
himself had continued, the war. Disgusted, and surely
not without reason, at popular assemblies, a long period
was suffered to elapse before the King called another
parliament, and it is, perhaps, doubtful whether he
would <HI>ever</HI> have done so, had he not been compelled by
a rebellion excited among his Scotch subjects, in behalf
of their factious presbytery and impious covenant.</P>
<P>An army of twenty thousand fanatics, rendered des∣perate
and implacable by the curses which their preach∣ers
denounced on such as “went not forth to help the
Lord against the mighty,” was marching to the bor∣ders.
At this critical time a Parliament was sum∣moned,
and one would conclude that <HI>real</HI> patriots could
have had no other object in view than the crushing so un∣provoked
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
a rebellion. To crush this Scotch insurrection
was, however, far from their wish: regardless of the
kingdom, and without designing to take any notice at
all of the royal application for necessary supplies, the
Commons entered immediately on their eternal com∣plaint
of grievances.</P>
<P>Where great evils lie on all sides, it is very difficult
to follow the best counsels. The King was in the great∣est
doubt and perplexity, and we cannot wonder that a
Parliament, which evidently had the peace of the king∣dom
so little at heart, was hastily dissolved. The disso∣lution
of this assembly was, however, a measure of
which the unfortunate Charles soon repented, and
which subsequent events, more than a thousand argu∣ments,
incline every one <HI>now</HI> to condemn.</P>
<P>The Scotch rebels mean-while marched into England,
and another Parliament was necessarily called. This as∣sembly
began with displaying a disposition more fierce and
unrelenting than had been visible in any preceding one.
Far from enabling their Prince to subdue the insur∣gents,
this House of Commons actually voted pay for
the <HI>Scotch rebels;</HI> with whom they kept up a constant
correspondence, and whom it was their avowed inten∣tion
to retain until the King himself should be totally
subdued, and all their own republican purposes effected.
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
“We cannot <HI>yet</HI> spare the Scotch,” (said a popular
leader in the cant of those times) “the sons of Zeruiah
are still too strong for us” Encompassed with ene∣mies,
the sad necessity of the King's affairs determined
him to leave this Parliament <HI>to itself:</HI> a year had not
elapsed before Charles beheld his most faithful servant
mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dered by them, himself stripped of every branch of
the prerogative, and the entire authority of the state,
executive as well as legislative, assumed by the House
of Commons. All this <HI>could</HI> not have been effected by
the powers of rhetoric or of reason. The House and the
nation were deeply tinctured with fanaticism, and the
pulpits, artfully and arbitrarily filled by the Commons
with preachers of that description, resounded with faction
and enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Hypocrisy, noise, and nonsense expelled sound piety
and sober sense; and the sole aim of the preachers was
to exasperate the minds of the mob alike against the
King and the Bishops: Herein their success certainly
equalled their wishes, and probably exceeded their ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>A democracy of the worst and most tyrannical sort
had now succeeded to our free and ancient government;
and as Charles had been compelled to assent to an Act
for making this Parliament perpetual, a civil war seemed
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
to be absolutely inevitable, before the constitution could
be <HI>restored.</HI> Accordingly vigorous preparations were
made by each party for an appeal to the sword; it
matters not at all, which of them drew it <HI>first,</HI> the
King having been unquestionably constrained to arm
in self-defence: if, indeed, his troops first took the
field, yet the Parliament had previously wrested from
him the militia, they had seized his castles, and had ap∣pointed
to them governors by their own authority.</P>
<P>To trace the <HI>progress</HI> of that calamitous war is
no part of my plan; the <HI>issue</HI> of it is but too
well known, and reflects indelible disgrace on this na∣tion;
as, under pretence of <HI>amending,</HI> it <HI>overturned</HI> the
constitution in church and state, and murdered one of
the best and most accomplished princes that ever wore
a crown.</P>
<P>Had Charles been born an absolute Monarch, his
humanity and his good sense would have rendered his
reign happy, and his memory precious. Had the limi∣tations
of prerogative been, in his time, fixed, his in∣tegrity
would have made him consider as sacred the
boundaries of the constitution. Had the Parliament
restored to him his <HI>just rights,</HI> after that those rights had
been precisely ascertained, his high sense of honor, and
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
his fear of GOD, would have prevented his ever stretch∣ing
the regal authority beyond its prescribed limits.</P>
<P>But the Commons had other ends in view. The
utter abolition of royalty was in truth the <HI>original</HI> aim
of all, who <HI>now</HI> remained in that factious assembly;
and one of their leaders, soon after the murder of their
pious, virtuous, and mild Sovereign, confessed in the
House that “if they were for a King, the last was as
proper as any gentleman in England.”</P>
<P>No sooner was the monarchy dissolved than the House
of Peers was, very consistently, voted to be useless; and
the Commons erected themselves into a democracy, un∣der
the denomination of “keepers of the liberties of England.”</P>
<P>This new form of government was very soon over∣turned
by a fanatical, hypocritical, military despot,
the arch-traitor Cromwell; who, seizing the <HI>whole</HI> au∣thority
of the state into his own hands, retorted upon
the Presbyterian sect, and the pretended patriots, part of
that severity which they had exercised towards the ad∣herents
of the Church and the King.</P>
<P>Such was the issue of an attempt to reform the con∣stitution
by violent means; even when its reformation
was confessedly needful. Upon this pretence were the
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
disturbances begun, and upon this pretence was the
monarch murdered.</P>
<P>“Let not us therefore murmur, as some of them
also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer;”
but let us rather learn wisdom from the folly of our an∣cestors,
and cautiously avoid “meddling with them that
are given to change.” We enjoy the most free and
equal government with which any age or nation was
ever blessed: a government which (now that the boun∣daries
of the constitution are fixed) as far surpasseth in
excellence the long famed polities of Athens and of
Rome, as <HI>they</HI> surpassed the despotism of Persia and
the East.</P>
<P>At the head of this government reigns a most excel∣lent
Prince, equally amiable in public and in private
life; a Prince who has uniformly acted like the fa∣ther
of his people; and has preserved entire that consti∣tution
both in Church and State, for the preservation of
which his family was called to the Throne.</P>
<P>If, in return for his paternal care of us, we could be
so ungrateful as to with-hold from him our cordial af∣fection
and chearful obedience, we should deserve to be
abhorred by GOD and good men, as a people whom
neither <HI>past miseries</HI> nor <HI>present mercies</HI> can bind to their
duty.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="27"/>
But, of disloyalty there is, I flatter myself, little
room for apprehension: The virtues of the Sovereign
have secured to him the hearts of his subjects. The
dread is (at present), from another quarter and of ano∣ther
kind. I mean, from attempts, however well meant,
to reform the representation of the people in the House
of Commons.</P>
<P>That our constitution is <HI>absolutely</HI> perfect, it would
be ridiculous to assert. Perfection belongs not to
lapsed humanity. That a better constitution may be
<HI>conceived,</HI> we do not positively deny. For many the∣ories
may be clearly conceived, which by the utmost hu∣man
ingenuity are not reducible to practice.</P>
<P>It may, however, be confidently asserted that so few
and so unimportant are the defects, so many and so va∣luable
the perfections, of the nicely balanced British
Constitution, as to render it highly probable that any
innovations in its system will be more likely to injure
than to improve it.</P>
<P>The people, it is alleged, are <HI>not fairly</HI> and <HI>equally</HI> re∣presented.
Granting the truth of this position, what
benefit could they derive from a <HI>more</HI> equal representa∣tion,
which they have not enjoyed, for almost a century,
from the <HI>present one?</HI> During all <HI>that</HI> time our <HI>rights and
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
liberties</HI> have been carefully preserved; and, in the name
of common sense, what would we have <HI>more?</HI></P>
<P>No plan of representation could possibly be devised in
which the WHOLE NATION would agree: Why
then should we hazard the consequences of an innova∣tion,
which it is <HI>barely possible</HI> might do some good; but
which is much more likely to <HI>create discord,</HI> and to pro∣ceed
to lengths which were never intended? Every rank
of men, amongst us, both in Church and State, may,
doubtless, learn most important lessons from the mis∣takes,
as well as from the crimes, of their predecessors.</P>
<P>Many popular leaders, in the beginning of the reign
of Charles, were <HI>wise men</HI> and <HI>true patriots.</HI> Now, if
differences between <HI>such Senators</HI> and <HI>such a Sovereign</HI>
produced in the end the horrid consequences which we
this day lament, what dreadful confusion have we not
just cause to expect, from differences about the Con∣stitution
excited, as seems at present intended, among
the <HI>people at large</HI> throughout the whole island, who
have neither <HI>leisure</HI> nor <HI>abilities</HI> to comprehend the sub∣ject?
Besides, altho' the spirit of superstition be now
so fast asleep that nothing like that which happened
in the last century can be apprehended in the present,
yet let us not forget that very lately the President of
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
the Protestant Association assembled twenty thousand
followers in the cause of fanaticism.</P>
<P>Should the legislature, however, in its wisdom, so far
yield to the fashionable cry for a <HI>parliamentary reform∣ation,</HI>
as to make any alteration in the House of Com∣mons,
it will, in that case, unquestionably be <HI>our</HI> duty,
and the duty of every Briton, quietly to submit, altho'
the alteration adopted should appear to us most un∣desirable.</P>
<P>In every state, be the form of government monarchi∣cal,
aristocratical, democratical, or a mixed one consist∣ing
of a <HI>fusion</HI> of the three simple forms, in every state
<HI>“the”</HI> supreme <HI>“power is ordained of</HI> GOD, <HI>whosoever
therefore resisteth that power resisteth the ordinance of</HI> GOD,
and they that resist (saith an apostle) shall receive to
themselves damnation.”</P>
<P>In a word—whether the legislature shall preserve the
state as it now is, or alter any part of it, let us, as good
subjects, and as friends to our country, “study to be
quiet, and mind every one his own business”—Let
us, by the grace of GOD, restrain passion, and overcome
prejudice, in ourselves. As subjects of a free constitu∣tion
let us be particularly careful to bear in mind the
counsel of the wise King, “to leave off contention be∣fore
it be meddled with.” So shall we learn to behave
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
suitably, according to Saint Peter's rule—“ as free, yet
not using our liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but
as the servants of GOD.”</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> is the most effectual course we can take to avert
the judgment still hanging over us for the horrid crime
which we this day deplore. And, if the spirits of just
men made perfect have any knowledge of what is doing
on earth, <HI>this</HI> is the course which, above all others, will
atone to the Spirit of the ROYAL MARTYR for the
barbarous treatment given him by our forefathers.</P>
<P>If we must be <HI>reformers,</HI> let us, by contemplating the
good parts of other men's characters, and the faulty
ones of our own, learn to think justly, that is humbly,
of ourselves. Humility will wonderfully dispose us to
contentment as to all external circumstances, be they
public or private.</P>
<P>Every Christian is a patriot or lover of his country
—every real patriot will then apply himself to personal
reformation, and by so doing he will labor to secure hap∣piness
to his native land.</P>
<P>Hypocrisy and fanaticism were the characteristics of
the last age, as infidelity, and a careless neglect of religion
and its duties, are the crying sins of the passing century.
Let but these evils be done away, and we shall soon hap∣pily
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
experience that for <HI>political</HI> reformations there will
be no occasion.</P>
<P>By “rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
and to GOD the things that are GOD'S,” and by “doing
to all men whatsoever we would they should do unto
us,” by applying (in every <HI>private</HI> and <HI>public</HI> calamity)
to the ever-present source of life, comfort, and blessing,
we shall happily experience that the <HI>compassion,</HI> as well as
the <HI>power,</HI> of our great Redeemer is “the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever.” Safe under <HI>His</HI> protection, who alone
“maketh men to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of one mind in” any commu∣nity,
delivered from all corroding anxiety about lives,
liberties, and fortunes, we shall chearfully pass the time
of our pilgrimage here in hope; and when called to
quit this scene, wherein every thing is mutable, and
which affords <HI>nought good unmixed with ill,</HI> we shall be
found meet to relish the occupations, and to taste the
delights, of that blissful Kingdom, which, by our ado∣rable
Redeemer, hath been opened to all believers.</P>
<P>Now to that GOD whom all Christians adore, to the
holy, blessed, and glorious Trinity, three persons and
one GOD, be ascribed all honor and glory, now and
for ever.</P>
