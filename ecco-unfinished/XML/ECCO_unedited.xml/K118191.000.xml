<HEAD>AN
ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>GENTLEMEN,</OPENER>
<P>HAD the question of yesterday been de∣cided
in a manner more favourable to
our wishes, which however the previous inti∣mations
of your temper in the business left us
little room to expect, we should have addressed
our thanks to you on the occasion. As it is,
we address to you our thanks for much casual
light thrown upon the subject, and for many
incidental testimonies of your esteem (whe∣ther
voluntary or involuntary we will not stop
to examine) which in the course of this dis∣cussion
you have favoured us with. We thank
you for the compliment paid the Dissenters,
when you suppose that the moment they are
eligible to places of power and profit, all such
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
places will at once be filled with them. Not
content with confounding, by an artful so∣phism,
the right of eligibility with the right
to offices, you again confound that right with
the probable fact, and then argue accordingly.
Is then the Test Act, your boafted bulwark, of
equal necessity with the dykes in Holland;
and do we wait, like an impetuous sea, to rush
in and overwhelm the land? Our preten∣sions,
Gentlemen, are far humbler. <HI>We</HI> had
not the presumption to imagine that, incon∣siderable
as we are in numbers, compared to
the established Church; inferior too in for∣tune
and influence; labouring, as we do,
under the frown of the Court, and the ana∣thema
of the orthodox; we should make our
way so readily into the secret recesses of royal
favour; and, of a sudden, like the frogs of
Egypt, swarm about your barns, and under
your canopies, and in your kneading troughs,
and in the chamber of the King. We rather
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
wished this act as a removal of a stigma than
the possession of a certain advantage, and we
might have been cheaply pleased with the
acknowledgment of the right, though we had
never been fortunate enough to enjoy the
emolument.</P>
<P>Another compliment for which we offer
our acknowledgements may be extracted from
the great ferment, which has been raised by
this business all over the country. What
stir and movement has it occasioned among
the different orders of men! How quick
the alarm has been taken, and sounded from
the Church to the Senate, and from the
press to the people; while fears and fore∣bodings
were communicated like an electric
shock! The old cry of, <HI>the Church is in
danger,</HI> has again been made to vibrate in
our ears. Here too if we gave way to im∣pressions
of vanity, we might suppose our∣selves
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
of much greater importance in the
political scale than our numbers and si∣tuation
seem to indicate. It shews at least
we are feared, which to some minds would
be the next grateful thing to being beloved.
We, indeed, should only wish for the latter;
nor should we have ventured to suppose, but
from the information you have given us,
that your Church <HI>was</HI> so weak. What!
fenced and guarded as she is with her ex∣clusive
privileges and rich emoluments, stately
with her learned halls and endowed colleges,
with all the attraction of her wealth, and
the thunder of her censures; all that the
orator calls <HI>the majesty of the Church</HI> about
her, and does she, resting in security under
the broad buckler of the State, does she
tremble at the naked and unarmed sectary?
he, whose early connections, and phrase
uncouth, and unpopular opinions set him at
a distance from the means of advancement;
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
he, who in the intercourses of neighbourhood
and common life, like new settlers, finds
it necessary to clear the ground before him,
and is ever obliged to root up a prejudice
before he can plant affection. He is not of
the world, Gentlemen, and the world loveth
her own. All that distinguishes him from
other men to common observation, operates
in his disfavour. His very advocates, while
they plead his cause, are ready to blush for
their client; and in justice to their own cha∣racter
think it necessary to disclaim all know∣ledge
of his obscure tenets. And is it from
his hand you expect the demolition of so
massy an edifice? Does the simple removal
of the Test Act involve its destruction?
These were not <HI>our</HI> thoughts. <HI>We</HI> had too
much reverence for your establishment to
imagine that the structure was so loosely put
together, or so much shaken by years, as that
the removal of so slight a pin should endanger
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
the whole fabric—or is the Test Act the <HI>talis∣man</HI>
which holds it together, that, when it is
broken, the whole must fall to pieces like the
magic palace of an enchanter? Surely no species
of regular architecture can depend upon so
slight a support.—After all what is it
we have asked?—to share in the rich be∣nefices
of the established church? to have
the gates of her schools and universities
thrown open to us? No, let her keep her
golden prebends, her scarfs, her lawn,
her mitres. Let her dignitaries be still as∣sociated
to the honours of legislation; and,
in our courts of executive justice, let her
inquisitorial tribunals continue to thwart the
spirit of a free constitution by a heterogeneous
mixture of priestly jurisdiction. Let her
still gather into barns, though she neither
sows nor reaps. We desire not to share
in her good things. We know it is the
children's bread, which must not be given
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
to dogs. But <HI>having</HI> these good things, we
<HI>could</HI> wish to hear her say with the generous
spirit of Esau, <HI>I have enough, my brother.</HI>
We could wish to be considered as children
of the State, though we are not so of the
Church. She must excuse us if we look
upon the alliance between her and the State
as an ill sorted union, and herself as a mother-in-law
who, with the too frequent arts of
that relation, is ever endeavouring to prejudice
the State, the common parent of us all,
against a part of his offspring, for the sake
of appropriating a larger portion to her own
children. We claim no share in the dowry
of her who is not our mother, but we may
be pardoned for thinking it hard to be de∣prived
of the inheritance of our father.</P>
<P>But it is objected to us that we have
sinned in the manner of making our request;
we have brought it forward as a claim instead
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
of asking it as a favour. We should have
sued, and crept, and humbled ourselves.
Our preachers and our writers should not
have dared to express the warm glow of
honest sentiment, or, even in a foreign country
glance at the downfall of a haughty aris∣tocracy.
As we were suppliants, we should
have behaved like suppliants, and then per∣haps
—No, Gentlemen, we wish to have
it understood, that we <HI>do</HI> claim it as a right.
It loses otherwise half its value. We claim
it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim
it as good subjects. We are not conscious
of having brought the disqualification upon
ourselves by a failure in any of these cha∣racters.</P>
<P>But we already enjoy a complete toleration
—It is time, so near the end of the eighteenth
century, it is surely time to speak with pre∣cision,
and to call things by their proper
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
names. What you call toleration, we call the
exercise of a natural and unalienable right.
We do not conceive it to be toleration, first
to strip a man of all his dearest rights, and
then to give him back a part; or even if it
were the whole. You tolerate us in wor∣shipping
God according to our consciences
—and why not tolerate a man in the use of
his limbs, in the disposal of his private pro∣perty,
the contracting his domestic engage∣ments,
or any other the most acknowledged
privileges of humanity? It is not to these
things that the word toleration is applied
with propriety. It is applied, where from
lenity or prudence we forbear doing all which
in justice we might do. It is the bearing
with what is confessedly an evil, for the
sake of some good with which it is con∣nected.
It is the Christian virtue of long
suffering; it is the political virtue of adapting
measures to times and seasons and situations.
<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<HI>Abuses</HI> are tolerated, when they are so inter∣woven
with the texture of the piece, that the
operation of removing them becomes too deli∣cate
and hazardous. <HI>Unjust claims</HI> are tole∣rated,
when they are complied with for the sake
of peace and conscience. The failings and
imperfections of those characters in which
there appears an evident preponderancy of
virtue, are tolerated. These are the proper
objects of toleration, these exercise the pa∣tience
of the Christian and the prudence of
the Statesman; but if there be a power that
advances pretences which we think un∣founded
in reason or scripture, that exercises
an empire within an empire, and claims sub∣mission
from those naturally her equals; and
if we, from a spirit of brotherly charity, and
just deference to public opinion, and a salu∣tary
dread of innovation, acquiesce in these
pretensions; let her at least be told that the
virtue of forbearance should be transferred,
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>
and that it is we who tolerate her, not she
who tolerates us.</P>
<P><HI>Complete Toleration,</HI> though an expression
often adverted to by both parties, is in truth
a solecism in terms; for all that is tolerated
ought to be done away whenever it is found
practicable and expedient. Complete Conva∣lescence
is no longer Convalescence, but
Health; and complete Toleration is no longer
Toleration, but Liberty. Let the term there∣fore
be discarded, which, however softened,
involves in it an insult with regard to us, and
however extended, an absurdity with regard to
yourselves. Sensible that a spirit of liberality
requires the indulgence to be <HI>complete,</HI> and
desirous at the same time to retain the idea of
our holding it through sufferance and not of
right, you have been betrayed into this incon∣gruity
of expression. Those are always liable
to be betrayed into such, who have not the
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
courage to embrace a system in its full extent,
and to follow a principle wherever it may lead
them. Hence the <HI>progress</HI> from Error to
Truth, and from Bigotry to the most enlarged
freedom of sentiment, is marked with greater
<HI>inconsistencies</HI> than that state in which the mind
quietly rests in the former position. It is
only when we view objects by a dubious and
uncertain twilight that we are apt to mistake
their figure and distances, and to be disturbed
by groundless terrors; in perfect darkness we
form no judgment about them.—It has ever
been the untoward fate of your Church to
partake largely of these inconsistencies. Placed
between the Catholics on one side, and the
Dissenters on the other, she has not been able
to defend either her resistance or her restraints,
and lies equally open to censure for her per∣secution
and her dissent. Pressed by the dif∣ficulties
of her peculiar situation, she is con∣tinually
obliged in the course of her polemic
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
warfare to change her ground, and alter her
mode of defence; and like the poor Bat in the
fable, to tell a different story upon every new
attack; and thus it must be, till she shall
have the magnanimity to make use of all her
light, and follow her reason without reserve.</P>
<P>For Truth is of a nature strangely encroach∣ing,
and ought to be kept out entirely if we
are not disposed to admit her with perfect
freedom. You cannot say to her, Thus far
shalt thou go, and no further. Give her the
least entrance, and she will never be satisfied
till she has gained entire possession. Allow
her but a few plain axioms to work with, and
step by step, syllogism after syllogism, she
insensibly mines her way into the very heart
of her enemy's entrenchments. Truth is of a
very intolerant spirit. She will not make any
compromise with Error, and if she be obliged
to hold any fellowship with her, it is such
<PB N="16" REF="16"/>
fellowship as light has with darkness, a per∣petual
warfare and opposition. Every con∣cession
made by her antagonist is turned into a
fresh weapon against her, and being herself in∣vulnerable,
she is sure to gain by each succes∣sive
contest, till her adversary is driven from
every shelter and lurking-hole, and fairly
obliged to quit possession of the field.</P>
<P>But this, it is again imputed to us, is no
contest for religious liberty, but a contest for
power, and place, and influence. We want
civil offices—And why should citizens <HI>not</HI>
aspire to civil offices? Why should not the
fair field of generous competition be freely
opened to every one!—A contention for
power—It is not a contention for power be∣tween
Churchmen and Dissenters, nor is it as
Dissenters we wish to enter the lists; we wish
to bury every name of distinction in the com∣mon
appellation of Citizen. We wish not
<PB N="17" REF="17"/>
the name of Dissenter to be pronounced, ex∣cept
in our theological researches and religious
assemblies. It is you, who by considering us
as Aliens, make us so. It is you who force
us to make our dissent a prominent feature in
our character. It is you who give relief, and
cause to come out upon the canvas what we
modestly wished to have shaded over, and
thrown into the back ground. If we are a
party, remember it is you who force us to be
so.—We should have sought places of trust—
By no unfair, unconstitutional methods should
we have sought them, but in the open and
honourable rivalship of virtuous emulation;
by trying to deserve well of our King and our
Country. Our attachment to both is well
known.</P>
<P>Perhaps however we have all this while
mistaken the matter, and what we have taken
for bigotry and a narrow-minded spirit is
<PB N="18" REF="18"/>
after all only an affair of calculation and arith∣metic.
Our fellow-subjects remember the
homely proverb, “the fewer the better
cheer,” and, very naturally, are glad to see
the number of candidates lessened for the ad∣vantages
they are themselves striving after.
If so, we ask their excuse, their conduct is
quite simple, and if, from the number of
concurrents, Government were to strike out
all above or under five feet high, or all whose
birth-days happened before the Summer Sol∣stice,
or, by any other mode of distinction
equally arbitrary and whimsical were to reduce
the number of their rivals, <HI>they</HI> would be
equally pleased, and equally unwilling to ad∣mit
an alteration. We are a mercantile peo∣ple,
accustomed to consider chances, and we
can easily perceive that in the lottery of life, if
a certain proportion are by some means or other
excluded from a prize, the adventure is ex∣actly
so much the better for the remainder.
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
If this indeed be the case, as I suspect it may,
we have been accusing you wrongfully. Your
conduct is founded upon principles as sure and
unvarying as mathematical truths; and all
further discussion is needless. We drop the
argument at once. Men have now and then
been reasoned out of their prejudices, but it
were a hopeless attempt to reason them out of
their interest.</P>
<P>We likewise beg leave to apologize to those
of the clergy, whom we have unwittingly of∣fended
by endeavouring to include <HI>them</HI> as
parties in our cause. “Pricked to it by
foolish honesty and love,” we thought that
what appeared so grievous to us could not be
very pleasant to them: but we are convinced
of our mistake, and sorry for our officiousness.
We own it, Sirs, it was a fond imagination
that because <HI>we</HI> should have felt uneasy under
the obligation imposed upon you, it should
<PB N="20" REF="20"/>
have the same effect upon yourselves. It was
weak to impute to you an idle delicacy of
conscience, which perhaps can only be pre∣served
at a distance from the splendid scenes
which you have continually in prospect. But
you will pardon us. We did not consider the
force of early discipline over the mind. <HI>We</HI>
are not accustomed to those salvos, and glosses,
and accommodating modes of reasoning with
which you have been long familiarized. You
have the happy art of making easy to your∣selves
greater things than this. You are re∣gularly
disciplined troops, and understand every
nice manoeuvre and dextrous evolution which
the nature of the ground may require. We
are like an unbroken horse; hard mouthed,
and apt to start at shadows. Our conduct
towards you in this particular we acknowledge
may fairly provoke a smile at our simplicity.
Besides, upon reflection what should you startle
at? The mixture of secular and religious
<PB N="21" REF="21"/>
concerns cannot to you appear extraordinary;
and in truth nothing is more reasonable than
that, as the State has been drawn in to the
aggrandizement of your Church, your Church
should in return make itself subservient to the
convenience of the State. If we are wise, we
shall never again make ourselves uneasy about
your share of the grievance.</P>
<P>But we were enumerating our obligations
to you, Gentlemen, who have thwarted our
request, and we must take the liberty to in∣form
you that if it be any object of our am∣bition
to exist and attract notice as a separate
body, you have done us the greatest service in
the world. What we desired, by blending us
with the common mass of citizens, would
have sunk our relative importance, and con∣signed
our discussions to oblivion. You have
refused us; and by so doing, you keep us
under the eye of the public, in the interesting
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>
point of view of men who suffer under a depri∣vation
of their rights. You have set a mark
of separation upon us, and it is not in our
power to take it off, but it is in our power to
determine whether it shall be a disgraceful
stigma or an honourable distinction. If, by
the continued peaceableness of our demeanour,
and the superior sobriety of our conversation,
a sobriety for which we have not yet quite
ceased to be distinguished; if, by our attention
to literature, and that ardent love of liberty
which you are pretty ready to allow us, we de∣serve
esteem, we shall enjoy it. If our rising
seminaries should excel in wholesome disci∣pline
and regularity, if <HI>they</HI> should be schools
of morality, and yours, unhappily, should be
corrupted into schools of immorality, you will
entrust us with the education of your youth,
when the parent, trembling at the profligacy
of the times, wishes to preserve the blooming
and ingenuous child from the degrading taint
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
of early licentiousness. If our writers are
solid, elegant, or nervous, you will read our
books and imbibe our sentiments, and even
your Preachers will not disdain, occasionally, to
<HI>illustrate</HI> our morality. If we enlighten the
world by philosophical discoveries, you will
pay the involuntary homage due to genius,
and boast of our names when, amongst foreign
societies, you are inclined to do credit to your
country. If your restraints operate towards
keeping us in that middle rank of life where
industry and virtue most abound, we shall
have the honour to count ourselves among
that class of the community which has ever
been the source of manners, of population and
of wealth. If we seek for fortune in that
track which you have left most open to us,
we shall increase your commercial importance.
If, in short, we render ourselves worthy of
respect, you cannot hinder us from being
respected—you cannot help respecting us—
<PB N="24" REF="24"/>
and in spite of all names of opprobrious sepa∣ration,
we shall be bound together by mutual
esteem and the mutual reciprocation of good
offices.</P>
<P>One good office we shall most probably
do you is rather an invidious one, and sel∣dom
meets with thanks. By laying us under
such a marked disqualification, you have
rendered us—we hope not uncandid—we
hope not disaffected—May the God of love
and charity preserve us from all such acrimo∣nious
dispositions! But you certainly have,
as far as in you lies, rendered us quick sighted
to encroachment and abuses of all kinds. We
have the feelings of men; and though we
should be very blameable to suffer ourselves to
be biassed by any private hardships, and hope
that, as a body, we never shall, yet this you
will consider, that we have at least no bias on
the other side. We have no favours to blind
<PB N="25" REF="25"/>
us, no golden padlock on our tongues, and
therefore it is probable enough, that, if cause
is given, we shall cry aloud and spare not.
But in this you have done yourselves no dis∣service.
It is perfectly agreeable to the jealous
spirit of a free constitution that there should
be some who will season the mass with the
wholesome spirit of opposition. Without a
little of that bitter leaven there is great danger
of its being corrupted.</P>
<P>With regard to ourselves, you have by
your late determination given perhaps a salu∣tary,
perhaps a seasonable check to that spirit
of worldliness, which of late has gained but
too much ground amongst us. Before you—before
the world—we have a right to bear the
brow erect, to talk of rights and services;
but there is a place and a presence where it
will become us to make no boast. We, as
well as you, are infected. We, as well
<PB N="26" REF="26"/>
as you, have breathed in the universal
contagion—a contagion more noxious, and
more difficult to escape, than that which on
the plains of Cherson has just swept from
the world the martyr of humanity; the con∣tagion
of selfish indifference, and fashionable
manners has seized us: and our languishing
virtue feels the debilitating influence.—If you
were more conversant in our assemblies than
your prejudices will permit you to be, you
would see indifference, where you fancy there
is an over proportion of zeal: you would see
principles giving way, and families melting
into the bosom of the church under the warm
influence of prosperity. You would see that
establishments, without calling coercive mea∣sures
to their aid, possess attraction enough
severely to try the virtue and steadiness of those
who separate from them. You need not strew
thorns, or put bars across our path; your
golden apples are sufficient to make us turn
<PB N="27" REF="27"/>
out of the way. Believe me, Gentlemen,
you do not <HI>know</HI> us sufficiently to aim your
censure where we should be most vulnerable.</P>
<P>Nor need you apprehend from us the slightest
danger to your own establishment. If you
will needs have it that it <HI>is</HI> in danger, we wish
you to be aware that the danger arises from
among yourselves. If ever your creeds and
formularies become as grievous to the gene∣rality
of your Clergy as they already are to
many delicate and thinking minds amongst
them; if ever any material articles of your
professed belief should be generally disbelieved,
or that order which has been accustomed to
supply faithful pastors and learned enquirers
after truth should become a burden upon a
generous public; and if her dignities and
emoluments, instead of being graced by merit
or genius, and thus in some measure balancing
the weight of hereditary honour and in∣fluence,
<PB N="28" REF="28"/>
should be considered as appendages
to them, the cry for reformation would
then be loud and prevailing. It <HI>would</HI>
be heard. Doctrines which will not stand
the test of argument and reason will not always
be believed, and when they have ceased to be
generally believed they will not long be arti∣cles
of belief. If therefore there is any weak
place in your system, any thing which you
are obliged to gloss over, and touch with a
tender hand, any thing which shrinks at in∣vestigation
—Look ye to it, its extinction is
not far off. Doubts and difficulties, that
arise first amongst the learned, will not stop
there; they inevitably spread downwards from
class to class; and if the people should ever
find that your articles are generally subscribed
as articles of peace, they will be apt to re∣member
that they are articles of expence too.
If all the Dissenters in the kingdom, still be∣lieving
as Dissenters do, were this moment,
<PB N="29" REF="29"/>
in order to avoid the reproach of schism, to
enter the pale of your church, they would do
you mischief; they would hasten its decline;
and if all who in their hearts dissent from
your professions of faith were to cease making
them, and throw themselves amongst the
Dissenters, you would stand the firmer for it.
Your church is in no danger because we are of
a different church; they might stand together
to the end of time without interference; but
it will be in great danger whenever it has
within itself many who have thrown aside its
doctrines, or even, who do not embrace them
in the simple and obvious sense. All the
power and policy of man cannot continue a
system <HI>long</HI> after its truth has ceased to be
acknowledged, or an establishment <HI>long</HI> after
it has ceased to contribute to utility. It is
equally vain, as to expect to preserve a tree,
whose roots are cut away. It may look as
green and flourishing as before for a short
<PB N="30" REF="30"/>
time, but its sentence is passed, its principle
of life is gone, and death is already within it.
If then you think the church in danger, be
not backward to preserve the sound by sacri∣ficing
the decayed.</P>
<P>To return to ourselves, and our feelings
on the business lately in agitation—
You will excuse us if we do not appear
with the air of men baffled and disap∣pointed.
Neither do we blush at our defeat;
we may blush, indeed, but it is for our coun∣try;
but we lay hold on the consoling persua∣sion,
that reason, truth and liberality must finally
prevail. We appeal from Philip intoxicated
to Philip sober. We know you will refuse us
while you are narrow minded, but you will
not always be narrow minded. You have too
much light and candour not to have more.
We will no more attempt to pluck the green
unripe fruit. We see in you our future friends
<PB N="31" REF="31"/>
and brethren, eager to confound and blend
with ours your interests and your affections.
You will grant us all we ask. The only
question between us is, whether you will do
it to-day—To-morrow you certainly will.
You will even intreat us, if need were, to allow
you to remove from your country the stigma of
illiberality. We appeal to the certain, sure
operation of increasing light and knowledge,
which it is no more in your power to stop,
than to repel the tide with your naked hand,
or to wither with your breath the genial in∣fluence
of vegetation. The spread of that
light is in general gradual and imperceptible;
but there are periods when its progress is ac∣celerated,
when it seems with a sudden flash
to open the firmament, and pour in day at
once. Can ye not discern the signs of the
times? The minds of men are in movement
from the Borysthenes to the Atlantic. Agi∣tated
with new and strong emotions, they
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>
swell and heave beneath oppression, as the
seas within the Polar Circle, when, at the
approach of Spring, they grow impatient to
burst their icy chains; when what, but an
instant before, seemed so firm, spread for
many a dreary league like a floor of solid mar∣ble,
at once with a tremendous noise gives
way, long fissures spread in every direction,
and the air resounds with the clash of floating
fragments, which every hour are broken
from the mass. The genius of Philosophy is
walking abroad, and with the touch of Ithu∣riel's
spear is trying the establishments of the
earth. The various forms of Prejudice, Su∣perstition
and Servility start up in their true
shapes, which had long imposed upon the
world under the revered semblances of Ho∣nour,
Faith, and Loyalty. Whatever is loose
must be shaken, whatever is corrupted must
be lopt away; whatever is not built on the
broad basis of public utility must be thrown
<PB N="33" REF="33"/>
to the ground. Obscure murmurs gather,
and swell into a tempest; the spirit of En∣quiry,
like a severe and searching wind, pe∣netrates
every part of the great body politic;
and whatever is unsound, whatever is infirm,
shrinks at the visitation. Liberty, here with
the lifted crosier in her hand, and the crucifix
conspicuous on her breast; there led by Phi∣losophy,
and crowned with the civic wreath,
animates men to assert their long forgotten
rights. With a policy, far more liberal and
comprehensive than the boasted establishments
of Greece and Rome, she diffuses her bles∣sings
to every class of men; and even extends
a smile of hope and promise to the poor Afri∣can,
the victim of hard, impenetrable avarice.
Man, <HI>as</HI> man, becomes an object of respect.
Tenets are transferred from theory to practice.
The glowing sentiment and the lofty specula∣tion
no longer serve “but to adorn the pages
of a book;” they are brought home to men's
<PB N="34" REF="34"/>
business and bosoms; and, what some cen∣turies
ago it was daring but to think, and
dangerous to express, is now realized, and
carried into effect. Systems are analysed into
their first principles, and principles are fairly
pursued to their legitimate consequences. The
enemies of reformation, who palliate what
they cannot defend, and defer what they dare
not refuse; who, with Festus, put off to a
more convenient season what, only because it
is the present season is inconvenient, stand
aghast; and find they have no power to put
back the important hour, when nature is la∣bouring
with the birth of great events. Can
ye not discern—But you do discern these
signs; you discern them well, and your alarm
is apparent. You see a mighty empire break∣ing
from bondage, and exerting the energies
of recovered freedom: and England—which
was used to glory in being the assertor of li∣berty,
and refuge of the oppressed—Eng∣land,
<PB N="35" REF="35"/>
who with generous and respectful sym∣pathy,
in times not far remote from our own
memory, has afforded an asylum to so many
of the subjects of that very empire, when
crushed beneath the iron rod of persecution;
and, by so doing, circulated a livelier abhor∣rence
of tyranny within her own veins—
England, who has long reproached her with
being a slave now censures her for daring to
be free. England, who has held the torch
to her, is mortified to see it blaze brighter in
her hands. England, for whom, and for
whose manners and habits of thinking, that
empire has, for some time past, felt even an
enthusiastic prediliction; and to whom, as a
model of laws and government, she looks
up with affectionate reverence—England,
nursed at the breast of liberty, and breathing
the purest spirit of enlightened philosophy,
views a sister nation with affected scorn and
real jealousy, and presumes to ask whether she
<PB N="36" REF="36"/>
yet exists—Yes, all of her exists that is
worthy to do so. Her dungeons indeed exist
no longer, the iron doors are forced, the massy
walls are thrown down; and the liberated
spectres, trembling between joy and horror,
may now blazon the infernal secrets of their
prison house. Her cloistered Monks no longer
exist, nor does the soft heart of sensibility beat
behind the grate of a convent, but the best
affections of the human mind permitted to
flow in their natural channel, diffufe their
friendly influence over the brightening pros∣pect
of domestic happiness. Nobles, the
creatures of Kings, exist there no longer; but
Man, the creature of God, exists there.
Millions of men exist there who, only now,
truly begin to exist, and hail with shouts of
grateful acclamation the better birth-day of
their country. Go on, generous nation, set
the world an example of virtues as you have
of talents. Be our model, as we have been
<PB N="37" REF="37"/>
yours. May the spirit of wisdom, the spirit
of moderation, the spirit of firmness, guide
and bless your counsels. With intelligence to
discern the best possible, may you have pru∣dence
to be content with the best practicable.
Overcome our wayward perverseness by your
steadiness and temper. Silence the scoff of your
enemies, and the misgiving fears of your timo∣rous
well-wishers. Go on to destroy the empire
of prejudices, that empire of gigantic shadows,
which are only formidable while they are not
attacked. Cause to succeed to the mad am∣bition
of conquest the pacific industry of
commerce, and the simple, useful toils of
agriculture. While your corn springs up under
the shade of your Olives, may bread and peace
be the portion of the Husbandman; and when
beneath your ardent sun, his brow is bathed in
honest sweat, let no one dare any longer with hard
and vexatious exactions to wring from him the
bitter drop of anguish. Instructed by the expe∣rience
<PB N="38" REF="38"/>
of past centuries, and by many a sad and
sanguine page in your own histories, may you
no more attempt to blend what God has made
separate; but may religion and civil polity, like
the two necessary but opposite elements of fire
and water, each in its province do service to
mankind, but never again be forced into discor∣dant
union. Let the wandering pilgrims of
every tribe and complexion, who in other
lands find only an asylum, find with you a
country, and may you never seek other proof
of the purity of your faith than the large∣ness
of your charity. In your manners, your
language, and habits of life, let a manly sim∣plicity,
becoming the intercourse of equals
with equals, take the place of overstrained re∣finement
and adulation. Let public reforma∣tion
prepare the way for private. May the
abolition of domestic tyranny introduce the
modest train of houshold virtues, and purer
incense be burned upon the hallowed altar of
<PB N="39" REF="39"/>
conjugal fidelity. Exhibit to the world the
rare phoenomenon of a patriot minister, of a
philosophic senate. May a pure and perfect
system of legislation proceed from their form∣ing
hands, free from those irregularities and
abuses, the wear and tear of a constitution,
which in a course of years are necessarily ac∣cumulated
in the best formed States; and
like the new creation in its first gloss and
freshness, yet free from any taint of corrup∣tion,
when its Maker blest and called it good.
May you never lose sight of the great prin∣ciple
you have held forth, the natural equality
of men. May you never forget that without
public spirit there can be no liberty; that
without virtue there may be a confederacy,
but cannot be a community. May you, and
may we, consigning to oblivion every less ge∣nerous
competition, only contest who shall
set the brightest example to the nations, and
<PB N="40" REF="40"/>
may its healing influence be diffused, till the
reign of Peace shall spread
<Q><L>—“from shore to shore,</L>
<L>'Till <HI>Wars</HI> shall cease, and <HI>Slavery</HI> be no more.”</L></Q></P>
<P>Amidst causes of such mighty operation,
what are we, and what are our petty, pecu∣liar
interests! Triumph, or despondency, at
the success or failure of our plans, would be
treason to the large, expanded, comprehensive
wish which embraces the general interests of
humanity. Here then we fix our foot with
undoubting confidence, sure that all events
are in the hands of him, who from seeming
evil
<Q><L>—“is still educing good;</L>
<L>And better thence again, and better still,</L>
<L>In infinite progression.”</L></Q></P>
<P>In this hope we look forward to the period
when the name of <HI>Dissenter</HI> shall no more be
<PB N="41" REF="41"/>
heard of, than that of <HI>Romanist</HI> or <HI>Episcopa∣lian,</HI>
when nothing shall be venerable but
truth, and nothing valued but utility.</P>
