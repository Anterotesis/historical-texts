<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>THE Great, the Good, the Wise, in every Age,</L>
<L>Have made a moral Mirrour of the Stage;</L>
<L>While, to the Shame and Spite of tasteless Fools,</L>
<L><HI>Terence</HI> still reigns a Classic in our Schools:</L>
<L>But now the <HI>DRAMA</HI> fears a sad Decline,</L>
<L>And peevish Hypocrites its Fall combine.</L>
<L>From Stage to Stage, behold our Author toss'd,</L>
<L>And but for you, his Genius crush'd and lost.</L>
<L>No <HI>Wilks</HI>, no <HI>Booth!</HI> his Labours to requite,</L>
<L>He here takes shelter, studious to delight.</L>
<L>But to our <HI>FARCE</HI>—It has a double Aim,</L>
<L>To honour Wedlock, and put Fools to Shame;</L>
<L>Folly and Prejudice, too near a Kin,</L>
<L>Supply pert Coxcombs with eternal Grin;</L>
<L>So infinitely stupid is their Mirth,</L>
<L>They'll ridicule one's very Place of Birth,</L>
<L>And cry, <HI>An honest Yorkshire-Man! a Wonder!</HI></L>
<L>But let them shoot their Bolts, let Blockheads blunder.</L>
<L>The glorious Heroes of the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Line,</L>
<L>To Times last Period shall in Annals shine;</L>
<L>While sland'ring Slaves, who would those Honours blot,</L>
<L>Shall unregarded live,—and die forgot,</L>
<L>Mean and unmanly is such partial Spite,</L>
<L>Averse to Nature's Laws, to Reason's Light;</L>
<L>All Fellow-Creatures, sure, should social be,</L>
<L>Nay, even to Brutes we owe Humanity.</L>
<L>Our Author does in Virtue's Cause engage,</L>
<L>In hopes to make her shine upon the Stage;</L>
<L>A modest Entertainment we intend,</L>
<L>Willing to please, yet fearful to offend;</L>
<L>Indulge us therefore, if you can't commend.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. CANTRELL the Three First Nights.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MArriage of humane social States the best,</L>
<L>Has been too long the Coxcomb's common Jest,</L>
<L>While worn-out Reprobates, and silly Boys,</L>
<L>Unworthy as unknowing of its Joys,</L>
<L>Loudly exclaim against the Nuptial Life,</L>
<L>Extol the Harlot, but cry down the Wife.</L>
<L>To such Extreams their saucy Sneers are carry'd,</L>
<L>One wou'd conclude their Mothers dy'd unmarry'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Virtue's Glory see the Good and Great,</L>
<L>Set bright Examples of the Marriage State.</L>
<L>Behold our Sovereign Lord compleatly blest,</L>
<L>And in his Queen, of all that's good possest:</L>
<L>In his Illustrious Consort <HI>CAROLINE</HI>,</L>
<L>All Virtues, all Perfections, splendid shine.</L>
<L>Tho' plac'd in the Sublimity of Life,</L>
<L>Still a fond Mother, still a tender Wife,</L>
<L>Pattern of Virtue, and connubial Love,</L>
<L>A finish'd Copy of the blest Above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ladies, I now must plead the Poet's Cause,</L>

<L>If Value for our Sex can recommend,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, Spoken after the Third Night, in the Summer-Season, at the <HI>Haymarket</HI>.</HEAD>
<L>WE see with Pleasure the indulgent Town,</L>
<L>Wont let their veteran Bard be quite cast down:</L>
<L>Spight of Stage-Tyrants, and their partial Scoff,</L>
<L>He stood his Tryal, and came nobly off.</L>
<L>I told him, if the Ladies did befriend him,</L>
<L>He'd gain his Point, Success would sure attend him,</L>
<L>This Little House, this Season of the Year,</L>
<L>The Town so thin, might give the Man some Fear:</L>
<L>But full of Hopes, he follow'd Fortune's Call,</L>
<L>Better to Act it here, than not at all.</L>
<L>'Tis a new Practice, tho' I see no Reason,</L>
<L>To shut the Stage up all the Summer Season.</L>
<L>Our very Candle-snuffer's Winter's Pay,</L>
<L>Will scarce support him in a Summer's Day.</L>
<L>Why do our angry Grandsire's vent their Rage,</L>
<L>And persecute so fierce their once lov'd Stage,</L>
<L>Lost to all Taste of customary Joys,</L>
<L>These old Men quite forget they once were Boys.</L>
<L><HI>FIELDING</HI> and <HI>OATES</HI> may pray for <HI>London'</HI> Mayr,</L>
<L>He's granted them a Holiday this Fair.</L>
<L>Then hither bring your Daughters, Friends and Spouses;</L>
<L>We'll find Diversion, so you'll find full Houses.</L>
<L>We don't pretend the Tip-top to excel,</L>
<L>But 'tis some kind of Merit to mean well.</L>
