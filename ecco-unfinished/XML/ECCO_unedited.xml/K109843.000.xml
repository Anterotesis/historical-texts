<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY Man who is well acquaint∣ed with the World, and has made just Observations on Conversation in ge∣neral, will, we apprehend, subscribe to the Truth of Dean <HI>Swift</HI>'s Assertion, in the Motto affixed to our Title Page, namely, <HI>That</HI> PUNNING <HI>is a Talent which no Man affects to despise, but he that is without it:</HI> For notwithstanding what the Dull and Mo∣rose may advance to conceal their Ignorance or Ill-Nature, a smart Pun, or sensible Con∣ceit, adds much to the Life and Pleasure of the Conversation of Persons of the most ele∣vated Sense, and contributes at the same time to the Improvement of the Mind, by exhibiting a new and happy Association of Ideas, or Comparisons of different Objects and Ideas, which we should otherwise, per∣haps, never have been acquainted with. And though Collections of this Kind meet with an affected Contempt from the Stupid and Pedantic, yet it may be boldly and truly affirmed, that they afford rational Amusement to Men of real Taste, Genius, and even pro∣found Learning; being considered by the latter in the Light of an agreeable Relaxa∣tion, after severer Studies.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="4"/><HI>Bons Mots</HI>, or witty Sayings, are so far from being despised by Men of Erudition, that numberless Sages and Philosophers, of every Age and Country, have conveyed In∣struction to Posterity, in Sayings of Wit and Humour. The Truth of this Assertion every one of the least Reading can testify.</P>
<P>Thus much we thought it necessary to say, in behalf of Compilations of this Nature in general: As to this in particular, we flatter our∣selves, that the Reader will meet with much rational as well as innocent Amusement in it. As an Improvement to this Edition, many humorous Pieces are added, which were not in the former, nor even to be met with in any other Book of the Kind; and several Jests, in that which were thought too trite, are in this changed for others of greater Hu∣mour and Novelty: So that, upon the whole, it is presumed this Collection has as much Merit as any ever introduced to the Publick; whose Approbation the Editors shall think themselves happy in receiving, as they have not been wanting in their endeavours to deserve it.</P>

<HEAD>MRS. PILKINGTON's JESTS.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>RS. PILKINGTON speaking of the Oppression which <HI>Ireland</HI> laboured under from the <HI>English</HI> Government, very severely as well as sensibly ob∣served, <HI>That it is wrong Policy in the English to permit the People of Ireland to have an University. Learning naturally inspires Men with the Love of Liberty; the Principles of which ought to be discou∣raged in the Minds of those whom their Masters are pleased to condemn to Slavery, Want, and Oppres∣sion; unless perhaps it may be done with a cruel In∣tent of making their Yoke the more galling to them</HI>.</P>
<P>Dean <HI>Swift</HI> engaged Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Hus∣band, who was a Clergyman, to preach for him one <HI>Sunday</HI>, at St. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Cathedral in <HI>Dublin</HI>, and at the same time gave him and his Wife an Invitation to dine with him. During the course of that Day's Entertainment, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> ob∣served and has related the following Peculiarities in the Behaviour of the Dean; and which are with Propriety introduced here, as in the course of that Day's Conversation there were several Re∣partees passed between the Dean and Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="6"/>When Morning Service was over, Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI> met the Dean at the Church-door, sur∣rounded by a Crowd of poor People, to all of whom he gave Charity, excepting one old Wo∣man, who holding out a very dirty Hand to him, he told her gravely, <HI>That though she was a Beg∣gar, Water was not so scarce but that she might have washed her Hands</HI>.</P>
<P>At Dinner he placed himself at the Head of the Table, opposite to a large Pier-glass, under which was a Marble Side-board; so that he could see in the Glass whatever the Servants did at it. The Beef being over-roasted, the Company were all put into Confusion; the Dean called for the Cook-maid, and ordered her to take it down stairs, and do it less. The Maid answered very innocently, that she could not. <HI>Why, what sort of a Creature are you</HI>, says he, <HI>to commit a Fault that cannot be amended</HI>. And turning to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, he said very gravely, <HI>That he hoped, as the Cook was a Woman of Genius, he should, by this manner of arguing, be able, in about a Year's time, to convince her, that she had better send up the Meat too little than too much done</HI>. Then ad∣dressing himself to the Men Servants, he said, <HI>Whenever you imagine the Meat is ready, take it, Spit and all, and bring it up by force; and I will aid you if the Cook resists</HI>. The Dean turning his Eye on the Looking-glass, espied the Butler open∣ing a Bottle of Ale, and helping himself to the first Glass, and then filling up the Bottle with the Remains of another. <HI>Ha! Friend</HI>, says the Dean, <HI>sharp's the word, I find; you drank my Ale, for which I stop two Shillings of your Board-Wages this Week; for I scorn to be out-done in any thing, even in cheating</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>After Dinner, the Dean said to Mrs. <HI>Pilking∣ton</HI>, Pray, Madam, do you smoke? To which she replied, that neither she or her Husband smo∣ked. <HI>That is a sign</HI>, said he, <HI>you were neither of you bred in the University of</HI> Oxford; <HI>for Drink∣ing and Smoking are the first Rudiments of Learn∣ing taught there; and in those two Arts no Univer∣sity in</HI> Europe <HI>can out-do them</HI>.</P>
<P>The Dean then desired Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to tell him her Faults. <HI>Sir</HI>, replied she, <HI>I must beg to be excused; for if I can help it, you shall never find them out</HI>. The Dean said Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> should tell him if she would not.
<Q>“I will, Sir, (says Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI>) ”when I have discovered them.</Q>
Dr. <HI>Delany</HI> being present, asked the Dean why he was so unpolite as to suppose Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> had any Faults. <HI>Why, I will tell you</HI>, replied <HI>Swift; whenever I see a number of agreeable Qua∣lities in any Person, I am always sure they have bad ones sufficient to poize the Scale</HI>. Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI> bowed, and told the Dean, <HI>he did h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great honour</HI>. In this she said she copied Bishop <HI>Berkley</HI>, whom she had frequently heard declare, That when any Speech was made to him, which might be construed either into a Compliment or an Affront, or that had two Handles, he was so meek and so mild, that he always took hold of the best.</P>
<P>The Dean then asked Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, if she was a Queen what she should chuse to have after Dinner. To which she replied, <HI>Your Conversa∣tion</HI>. "Phooh! says he, I mean what Regale?" She chose Coffee.
<Q>“Why then (returned the Dean) I will make you as happy as a Queen; you shall have some in Perfection; for when I was Chaplain to the Earl of <HI>Berkley</HI>, who was
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
in the Government here, I was so poor that I was obliged to keep a Coffee-house, and all ”the Nobility resorted to it to talk Treason.</Q></P>
<P>At Supper, the Dean pulled out of his Pocket a Golden Cork-screw, and opening a Bottle of Wine, he decanted it off: The last Glass being thick, he called to Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to drink it, saying at the same time, that he always kept some poor Parson to drink his foul Wine for him. Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> entering into his Humour, thank∣ed him, and told him he did not know the dif∣ference, but was glad to get a Glass at any rate.
<Q>“Why then (says the Dean) you sha'n't, for I'll drink it myself. Why, Pox take you, you are wiser than a paltry Curate, whom I asked to dine with me a few days ago; for upon my making the same Speech to him, he told me he did not understand such Usage, and so walked off without his Dinner. By the same Token, I told the Gentleman who recommen∣mended him to me, that the Fellow was a ”Blockhead, and I had done with him.</Q></P>
<P>The Dean then missing his golden Cork-screw, told Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> she had stolen it; she affirm∣ed she had not. Upon looking for it, he found it where he had laid it; when he told Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI> it was well for her he had found it, or he should have charged her with Theft. She asked why she should be suspected more than any other in the Company? <HI>For a very good Reason</HI>, says he, <HI>because you are the poorest</HI>.</P>
<P>Another time Dean <HI>Swift</HI> had a Present made him, by the Author, of a Translation of <HI>Horace</HI>'s <HI>Epistles</HI>, very curiously bound. Soon after per∣using Part of it, he said to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, This Book has a special good Cover; but I have a mind
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
there should be something valuable in the Inside</HI>; so taking out his Penknife, he cut out all the Leaves close to the Margin, and ordered Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to paste some Letters of his Friend <HI>Pope, Boling∣broke, &amp;c.</HI> which he gave her, into the Cover. <HI>And now</HI>, says he, <HI>as to these Leaves which I have cut out, I will give them what they greatly want</HI>; and immediately threw them all into the <HI>Fire</HI>.</P>
<P>The Dean invited Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to take a walk with him in his Garden, but as she could not keep his Pace, he bade her sit down and rest herself, while he kept walking on, by way of Exercise. Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> relates, that she could not help smiling at the Dean's odd Gaite; she thought to herself, that he had written so much in Praise of Horses in <HI>Gulliver's Travels</HI>, that he was resolved to imitate them as nearly as he could. While she was indulging this Fancy, the Dean returned to her, and by his Discourse gave her a strong Confirmation of his Partiality to those Animals.
<Q>“I have been considering, Madam, as I walked, (said he,) what a Fool Mr. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI> was to marry you; for he could have afforded to keep a Horse for less Money than you cost him; and that, you must confess, would have given him better Exercise, and more Pleasure than a Wife.—Why you laugh, ”and do not answer me — Is it not truth?</Q>
—
<Q>“I must answer you, Sir, (said she,) with another Question: Pray how can a Bachelor judge of ”this matter?</Q>
<Q>“I find (says the Dean) you are vain enough to give yourself the Prefer∣”ence.</Q>
I do, Sir, to that Species here: A
<Q>“<HI>Hoyhnhum</HI> I would, as becomes me, give place ”to: But, Sir, it is going to rain.</Q>
<Q>“I hope not, (said he,) for that will cost me Six-pence
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
”for a Coach for you (the Garden being at a distance from the House;)</Q>
<Q>“Come, make haste, ”O how the Tester trembles in my Pocket!</Q>
She obey'd, and they got to the House just time enough to escape a heavy Shower.
<Q>“Thank God (says the Dean,) I have saved my Mo∣ney: Here, you Fellow (to his Servant,) carry this Six-pence to the lame old Man that sells Gingerbread at the Corner, because he tries to ”do something, and does not beg.</Q></P>
<P>One day the Dean told Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> he would tell him his Wife's Faults before her Face; and accordingly began, in his jocular way, by accusing her with the Insolence of pretending to criticize the Works of the most celebrated Ge∣niuses of the Age; and with affirming that she thought herself preferable to a Horse, and more capable of giving her Husband Pleasure; and other Matters of the like Nature. <HI>Well, Sir</HI>, said Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, all these Misdemeanours may be included under the Article, Pride: Now let me know my other Crime. Why</HI>, replied the Dean, <HI>you can't walk fast. Well, Sir</HI>, return'd Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, if I can't mend my</HI> Pride, <HI>I'll try to mend my</HI> Pace. <HI>Mr. Pilkington</HI>, said the Dean, <HI>I have a mind to</HI> clip <HI>your Wife's Wit. Indeed, Sir</HI>, replied she, <HI>that's Death by Law, for 'tis</HI> Sterling. <HI>Shut up your Mouth for all day, my Dear</HI>, said Mr. <HI>Pilkington, for that Answer is real Wit. Nay</HI>, cries the Dean, <HI>I believe we had better shut up our own, for at this rate she'll be too many for us</HI>.</P>
<P>At a Time when Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>'s Father was given over by the Physicians, who had ceased to prescribe for him, declaring that he could not outlive the Night; she of her own Head gave
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
him some Hock and Sack made warm, which threw him into a Sweat and deep Sleep, and, in short, recovered him, to the great Consternation of the Doctors; who, bantering her upon prac∣tising Physic without having taken her Degrees, she told them, she held her Right to practise, <HI>extra Judice</HI>; and smiling continued, <HI>she supposed they all understood Latin: But as their proper Business was to destroy Life, she hoped they would not take it amiss, as the Case so nearly concerned her, that she had frustrated their Design: But</HI>, added she, with a low Courtesey, <HI>I humbly presume to be∣lieve, you</HI>
<Q><L>Had rather chuse that he should die,</L>
<L>Than your Prescriptions prove a Lie.</L></Q></P>
<P>Col. <HI>D—e</HI>, a pleasant old Gentleman, once told Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, he wished she would take him into keeping; to which she answered, that she had really never seen any Person with whom she was better entertained; and therefore, added she, <HI>If you will make over all your real and personal Estate to me, and dispose of your Regiment, and give me the Money, I will</HI> keep <HI>you</HI>.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned Colonel, who was very parsimonious, being pressed by some Gentlemen to do an Act of Generosity, instead of comply∣ing, evaded it with a Joke; which occasioned Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> to observe to a Nobleman pre∣sent, <HI>the Colonel has so genteel and witty a Manner of excusing his Avarice, that should he ever grow generous, his Friends would lose a thousand Plea∣santries</HI>.</P>
<P>She was employed by a certain Gentleman to write some Poetical Pieces, which he insisted must abound with Wit; they were accordingly exe∣cuted to his Satisfaction, and he passed them
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
upon the Public as his own; but some time after, a little Difference arising between him and Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, he wrote her word, that she was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fool. To which she answered, <HI>I must insist on it you were a much greater, to apply to a</HI> Fool <HI>for</HI> Wit.</P>
<P>The first Day Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> opened her Pamphlet-shop in <HI>St. James's-street</HI>, a Clergyman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept in, and ask'd her if she had got any thing new? <HI>Yes, Sir</HI>, replied she, <HI>my present Situation</HI>.</P>
<P>She paid the following genteel and witty Com∣pliment to Lord <HI>Kingsborough: Invoke, my Lord, the sacred Nine; not one of the beauteous Virgins can be coy to such a Lover, resembling so much their own</HI> Apollo. <HI>I am very certain they have all be∣stowed their</HI> Favours, <HI>tho' you are a Man of too much Honour to reveal it</HI>.</P>
<P>A certain Painter, who took pride in telling every body, that he was Sir <HI>Godfrey Kneller</HI>'s Bastard, was told by Mrs. <HI>Pilkington, That some People were so fond of Family, that, to keep it up, they would prove themselves</HI> Sons of Whores.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> ridicules the Folly of rich and wicked Persons bequeathing their Wealth to the Poor after their Decease: <HI>As if</HI>, says she, <HI>the Omnipotent could not see through the shallow De∣vice, or that his eternal Kingdom was to be pur∣chased with their</HI> Leavings.</P>
<P>A Gentleman telling Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, that a certain Apothecary of her Acquaintance was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke, and obliged to shut up Shop; she en∣quired the Cause; to which the Gentleman re∣plied, he was so honest a Man, that instead of loading his Patients with Medicines, as was too common a Practice, he advised them to take the wholsome Air, and of course lost the Profit ari∣sing
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
from the Sale of his Drugs. <HI>Poor Man</HI>, says she, <HI>it is plain he could not live by the</HI> Air, <HI>tho' his Patients could</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, who was no great Friend to the Clergy, on account of the ill Usage she had met with from some of the Cloth, frequently re∣lated the following Story of the Count <HI>de St. Evremond</HI>.</P>
<P>When Count <HI>St. Evremond</HI>, whose Writings are so well known in the Literary World, was dangerously ill, and had not enjoyed any Sleep for a long Time, a Consultation of Physicians was held, to think of some Means to procure him Rest; which he being sensible of, called them to his Bed-side, and told them, he knew the Busi∣ness they were upon, and believed he had himself thought of the most effectual Remedy to procure sound Sleep. They listened with Attention, to hear what he had to offer; when he desired them to send for a certain Preacher, who was remark∣able for Dulness, saying, <HI>I don't remember that I ever heard that Gentleman preach, but I fell fast asleep before his Sermon was half ended</HI>.</P>
<P>The following was written by Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, on the old and facetious Col. <HI>D—e</HI>'s boasting, in a jocular way, of having received certain Fa∣vours from her, but that he made her no Present, because he could not be convinced of the Since∣rity of her Passion, if she made any Demands on his Pocket.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, being once at an Entertain∣ment, where, when different Toasts were going round, a Gentleman, whose Name was <HI>Brown</HI>, toasted an absent Lady, which he had done for many Years, though he never had the Courage to speak to her: Upon which Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> said to the Gentleman, <HI>I believe, Sir, you have toasted that Lady these seven Years, and it is surprizing she is not</HI> Brown <HI>yet</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> used to take great Pleasure in relating the following Stories, some of which were
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
of her own fertile Invention, and others she had heard among the Wits she visited.</P>
<P>A droll Fellow, who got a Livelihood by play∣ing on the Fiddle at Fairs, and about the Coun∣try, was one day met by an Acquaintance that had not seen him a great while, who accosted him with, <HI>Bless me! what are you alive? —Why not</HI>, answered the Fiddler, <HI>did you send any body to kill me? — No</HI>, replies the other, <HI>but I was told you was dead.— Ay, so it was reported, it seems</HI>, (says the Fiddler,) <HI>but I knew it was a confounded Lie as soon as I heard it</HI>.</P>
<P>A Gentleman met a Friend in the Street, whom he had not seen for some Years; and began to give him an account of what had befallen him since their Separation from each other: A Cart happened to intervene, upon which they took different Streets: Seven Years passed, and it so befell, they met just in the same Place, when, without the least Ceremony, he proceeded in his Story, <HI>And so as I was telling you, said he</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A good Woman quarrelling with her Husband for being somewhat too familiar with the Servant-Maid, charging him with many other Facts of the like Nature, which he knowing himself inno∣cent of, said to her, <HI>Indeed, Wife, you will lie with any Woman in the Kingdom, that's your Fail∣ing. No, you Rogue</HI>, replied the good Woman, in a great rage, <HI>it is you that will</HI> lie <HI>with any Wo∣man, and that's the Reason I am in such a Passion with you</HI>.</P>
<P>As the facetious <HI>H—y W—d</HI>, Comedian, was one Day walking with a Friend under <HI>Co∣vent-Garden Piazza</HI>, a poor miserable-looking Wretch asked his Charity. Seeing the Beggar's shocking Countenance, <HI>H—y</HI> put his Hand in
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
his Pocket and relieved him, saying at the same Time, <HI>This Fellow is certainly either a great Ob∣ject of Charity, or a very good</HI> Actor.</P>
<P>A young Fellow who fancied himself possessed of Talents sufficient to cut a Figure on the Stage in Comedy, offered himself to the Master of <HI>Co∣vent-Garden</HI> Theatre, who desired him to give a Specimen of his Abilities before Mr. <HI>Quin</HI>, the celebrated Player. After he had rehearsed a Speech or two, in a wretched Manner, <HI>Quin</HI> ask∣ed him, with a contemptuous Sneer, whether he had ever done any Part in Comedy. The young Fellow answered, that he had the Part of <HI>Abel</HI> in the Alchymist. To which <HI>Quin</HI> replied, with that sarcastical Turn peculiar to himself, <HI>You mis∣take, Boy, it was the Part of</HI> Cain <HI>you acted; for I am sure you murdered</HI> Abel.</P>
<P>Another time, one of equal Vanity and Inabi∣lity offered himself at the same Theatre, for Tra∣gedy; who, according to Custom, was to speak before Mr. <HI>Quin:</HI> Just as he began to rant forth a Tragedy Speech, a Dog, that was running a∣bout the Stage at the same Time, set up a terrible Howl: Upon which, <HI>Quin</HI> asked whose Dog it was, and being informed, he cried out, <HI>He's a Dog of good Judgment, by G</HI>—; and walked off without staying to hear the Speech out.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Miles Stapleton</HI>, a Gentleman of great For∣tune in the North of <HI>England</HI>, being a remarkably little Man, gave rise to the following Pun, and a hearty Laugh, which the Knight himself enjoy∣ed with the Company.—Two of the Company were disputing about the <HI>Yorkshire</HI> Miles; one asserted they were longer than in any Part of <HI>England</HI> beside, which the other denied, and it was left to the Decision of a famous Punster, who de∣clared,
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
he knew of no <HI>short Miles</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire</HI>, ex∣cept <HI>Sir Miles</HI>.</P>
<P>An extravagant young Fellow, who was very forward to spend his Money tho' he could but ill afford it, being one Evening in Company in a Public House, where it was proposed to spend Six-pence a piece; the young Spendthrift not contented with this reasonable Expence, insisted that it should be a Shillin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; saying he knew no Difference between a Shilling and Six-pence: To which a sly old C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nomi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> replied, <HI>But you will, young Gentl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man, when you come to be worth</HI> E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en-pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>

<P>A poor but worthy Clergyman, who possessed only a <HI>small</HI> Lectureship, from the Income of which he had a <HI>large</HI> Family to maintain, had been under the necessity, through some expen∣sive Family-sicknesses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of contracting Debts with several in the Parish, and being unable to answer their Demands, absconded some Time for fear of being troubled; and, in short, was so ashamed of facing his Creditors, that he even prevailed with a Friend to officiate for him on <HI>Sundays</HI>. However, considering this Method of Life could not last long, he took Courage, and resolved to preach the following <HI>Sunday</HI> before his Parishioners; when he took his Text from the New Testament, these Words, <HI>Have Pa∣tience, and I will pay you all</HI>. He began with dividing his Text into two general Heads; first,
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
<HI>Have Patience</HI>; secondly, <HI>and I will pay you all:</HI> He then expatiated very largely and elegantly on that most Christian Virtue, <HI>Patience</HI>; after which, <HI>And now</HI>, says he, <HI>having done with my first Head, viz.</HI> Have Patience, <HI>I come to my se∣cond and last general Head, which is</HI>, and I will pay you all; — <HI>but that I must defer to another Opportunity</HI>.</P>
<P>In the Time of the Wars between the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>'s Army and the <HI>French</HI>, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne</HI>, it was a constant Practice with the <HI>French</HI> Court to cause Illuminations and Bonfires to be made in <HI>Paris</HI> after every Battle, whether their Army got the Victory, or not, in order to keep up the Spirits of the Peo∣ple; particularly one time, when the <HI>English</HI> had totally defeated the <HI>French</HI>, and great Illu∣minations and Bonfires were made as usual; a <HI>French</HI> Soldier merrily said, <HI>Begar, the Peo∣ple of our Nation are like Flint-stones; the more you beat them, the more Fire they make</HI>.</P>
<P>A certain political Writer, on the <HI>Tory</HI> side of the Question, in a former Reign, being bribed over to the Court Interest by a Pension; one of the Party he had deserted, taxed him with the Meanness of being a Turncoat, and ask'd his Reason for quitting the Party for a Bribe? To which the Author answered, <HI>That he had seven very substantial Reasons for it</HI>, viz. <HI>a Wife and six Children</HI>.</P>
<P>A Gentleman passing over a Causeway in the Country, which parted two Waters, and was not railed on either Side to secure Passengers from falling, in case of their Feet slipping, says to a Countryman whom he overtook, <HI>Methinks this narrow Causeway must be very dangerous, ho∣nest

<P>A Court Member of the House of Commons, some Years ago, observing a new elected one of the opposite Party that sat next to him, and who was a remarkably fat Man, rising from his Seat to speak in a Debate, the Courtier cried out, <HI>Mr. Speaker, I beg your Attention to the Gen∣tleman next me, who is so</HI> full of Matter, <HI>that he cannot keep his Seat</HI>; which raised an immo∣derate Laugh, and so abashed the young Mem∣ber, that he sat down again, without speaking a Syllable.</P>
<P>A Parcel of merry Fellows in a Country-town, having a mind to humbug an honest toping Far∣mer, waylaid him one dark Evening, on his Re∣turn from a neighbouring Village, where he had got exceeding drunk, and took him off his Horse, and made a Pretence of rifling his Pockets of what he had, but took nothing from him; they then set him upon his Horse again, with his Face towards the Tail, and tying his Hands be∣hind him, they went away: The Horse, well acquainted with the Way home, carried his Ma∣ster safe into the Yard, and the Wife, hearing her Husband's Voice, went out with a Candle, and seeing his Situation, hastily enquired the Cause: The Farmer, as well as he could speak, told her, <HI>that he had been set upon by a Parcel of Robbers, who had stripped him of his Money, and used him very ill; but what vexes me most is</HI>, (adds the Farmer,) <HI>they have cut off my Horse's Head</HI>.</P>

The Inn-keeper an∣swered, the Penalty was greater if the Person kil∣led was married, than if single; and further, that it is Ten Crowns Forfeiture to wound an Inn-keeper with a Sword: Well, says the <HI>Gascon</HI>, and what would be the Fine if any Man was to strike me a Slap of the Face? He would be ob∣liged, answered the other, to pay you a Crown. The <HI>Gascon</HI>, very well knowing that his Reckon∣ing did not amount to above half that Sum, re∣plied; <HI>I wish then you would please to strike me a

Slap on the Face, and give me my Change, for I have no Money. What the Devil do you mean by that</HI>, says the Host, <HI>I insist upon having my Money, or I will seize your Cloak</HI>. The <HI>Gascon</HI>, whose Impudence never had failed him yet, was not at all daunted at this Rebuff, but told the Landlord, that if he did not hold his saucy Tongue, he would make him skip like a Hare; <HI>You!</HI> an∣swered the Host, <HI>'tis out of your Power to make me stir from this Place. I lay you the Price of the Reckoning</HI>, says the <HI>Gascon, that I make you run from this Place immediately. It's done</HI>, says the other. Upon which the <HI>Gascon</HI> took to his Heels, and ran away, and the Landlord after him, which the former perceiving, he turned round and cried out, <HI>Stop, stop, Landlord, you have fairly lost your Wager; you have no Demand upon me now</HI>; and so got cleverly off, without paying his Reckoning.</P>
<P>Some Soldiers, quartered in a Country-town, meeting a Farmer on the Road, a little way out of Town, in a dark Night, robbed him of his Great Coat and Money.

<P>A Gentleman having occasion to buy a Horse, and being no Judge in Horse Flesh, went to a Dealer whom he knew, and told him he wanted to buy a good Horse; but as he was ignorant how to make a proper choice, would leave it to

him; that he expected he (the Dealer) would put a good one into his Hands, without a single Fault, and that the Gentleman would not beat him down as to Price. A Bargain was made, the Jockey declaring, that to his Knowledge the Horse had not one Fault; and the Money was paid down. But Jockies will be Rogues; in a Day or two the Gentleman discovered, that not∣withstanding the Eyes of his Horse to all Ap∣pearance were good, he was in effect as blind as a Stone: Upon this, the Gentleman demanded the Return of his Money, which the Jockey had the Impudence to evade, by saying, <HI>I told you the Beast had no Fault; and I swear to you now that I do not know of one; and as to his being blind, I confess he is so; but that is a</HI> Misfortune, <HI>not a</HI> Fault.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> passing an Evening with an <HI>English</HI> Member of Parliament, who was a very free sacetious Gentleman, he related to her the following humorous Anecdotes.</P>
<P>In the Time of Sir <HI>Robert Walpole</HI>'s Admini∣stration, a certain <HI>Scotch</HI> Baronet, without a Foot of Estate, was returned duly elected for a Shire in <HI>Scotland</HI>, and immediately set out for <HI>London</HI>; and when he arrived there, took a Hackney-Coach, and drove to Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s. The Servant told him he was engaged; but the Baronet in∣sisted on his carrying up his Name; and, lest he should forget it, he jumped out of the Coach, and, running up Stairs after him, delivered his Embassy himself. Sir <HI>Robert</HI> welcomed him, and, like a Courtier, told him he should be glad to serve him: <HI>Nay, nay, Mon</HI>, returned he, <HI>I came na here for Compliments; I ha ne Siller to get a Lodging; so I'll e'en stay here till you give me some</HI>. So Sir <HI>Robert</HI> chose rather to give him Purse, than be plagued with his Impertinence.</P>
<P>A <HI>Scottish</HI> Peer, who was a Pensioner, and a remarkable fat Man, came one Morning, ac∣cording to Custom, to Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s Levee, and, without the least Ceremony, laid hold of his Button. Sir <HI>Robert</HI> could not readily disengage
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
himself, and the Nobleman lugged him to the Window, in which sousing himself down, he happened to break Wind backwards, which car∣ried with it so loud a Report, that it threw the whole Company into a Laughter. <HI>Very well, my Lord</HI>, said the Minister, <HI>pray what have you further to say? Why</HI>, answered the Peer, <HI>it is this, Sir</HI> Robert, <HI>I owe fifteen hundred Pounds, and by the Laird, if you do not give it me, I'll go To-morrow to the House, and vote according to my Conscience</HI>.</P>
<P>An <HI>English</HI> Earl, who was a Pensioner, once told Sir <HI>Robert</HI>, he was always at a loss how to vote, inasmuch as he did not understand the Debates: and was so near-sighted, that when the House divided, he knew not on which Side to go. Sir <HI>Robert</HI> bade him <HI>always follow the Bishops</HI>. It happened, on the Convention-Scheme three or four of the Bishops rose, and the Earl, seeing them move, he, according to his Master's Direction, followed them, and voted point-blank against his Interest.</P>
<P>The late Duke of <HI>Wharton</HI>, who was a Man of great Humour, at the Time of the Discovery of <HI>Atterbury's Plot</HI> (as it was called) which was proved by decyphering Letters and torturing the harmless Alphabet into Treason, saw a Man at the Door of the Parliament-House selling Horn-books. Sir <HI>Robert</HI>'s Equipage stopped, and the Duke laying hold of him as he alighted, told him, he was surprized he did not send that Fel∣low to <HI>Newgate</HI>, who was selling such a Libel on the Ministry: <HI>Why</HI>, says Sir <HI>Robert, my Lord, those are Horn-books. — Treason, by Jove</HI>, re∣plied the Duke, <HI>as I will convince you</HI>; and still holding him, ran on thus:
<Q><PB N="23" REF="27"/>
<L><HI>A</HI> stands for <HI>Army</HI>, and <HI>B</HI> for a <HI>Bench</HI>,</L>
<L><HI>C</HI> stands for <HI>Court</HI>, and <HI>D</HI> for a <HI>Drench</HI>;</L>
<L><HI>E</HI>, I won't interpret that.</L>

<L><HI>P</HI> stands for <HI>P—x</HI>, the <HI>Pretender</HI>, the <HI>Pope</HI>,</L>
<L>And <HI>R</HI> stands for <HI>Robin</HI>, and <HI>Ribbon</HI>, and <HI>Rope</HI>.</L></Q></P>
<P>In repeating the last Line, he pulled the Mi∣nister's blue String, and laugh'd in his Face. Sir <HI>Robert</HI> could not help laughing himself, and being naturally of a pacifick Disposition, he took it quietly.</P>
<P>Dean <HI>Swift</HI>, one Evening, having Mrs. <HI>Pil∣kington</HI> and several other Ladies at Supper with him, was giving them an Account of some Wo∣man, who, he told them, was the nastiest, most stinking old B—h that ever was seen, <HI>except the Company, Ladies, except the Company; for that you know is but civil</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> was at one Time, when in <HI>London</HI>, in great Distress, and lodged at the House of a very rapacious Woman. Her Custom (says Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>) was to live upon her Lodgers, even when she knew they were miserably poor; insomuch, that if one of them sent but for a Pint of Small Beer, she would intercept it in the Way, and drink half of it; <HI>but, indeed</HI>, (added Mrs. <HI>Pilkington) she was very civil, for she always sent them Word she drank their</HI> Healths; <HI>and so she did in reality, by depriving them of the Means of pre∣serving it</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, speaking of the Trouble and Uneasiness which over-ceremonious Persons occa∣sion in Company, made the following Observa∣tion:
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
<HI>What Respect soever our Nobility may think is owing to the</HI> French <HI>Mode of cringing and com∣plimenting, I must confess, I never see it practised without a peculiar Pain, which I can compare to nothing but the Apprehensions I am under at the Sight of Tumblers, Rope-Dancers</HI>, &amp;c. <HI>such as, I believe, all rational Creatures share, at seeing Men deform their Visages by a Thousand aukward Gri∣maces, and their Bodies like joi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Babies, only be∣cause it is a-la-M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise: Neither do we see any but the most illiterate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> practise it</HI>.</P>
<P>No Man had a greater Aversion to Excess of ridiculous Ceremony than Dean <HI>Swift</HI>; an In∣stance of which we shall here re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: A Lady of this Turn having given the Dean an Invitation to Dinner, and as she had heard he was not easily pleased, she had taken a Month to provide for it. When the Time came, every Delicacy which could be purchased the Lady had prepared, even to Profusion, (which <HI>Swift</HI> hated.) However, he was scarce seated, when she began to make a ceremonious Harangue; in which she told him, That she was sincerely sorry she had not a more tolerable Dinner, since she was apprehensive there was not there any Thing fit for him to eat; in short, that it was a bad Dinner. <HI>Pox take you</HI>, (said the Dean) <HI>why did you not get a better? Sure you had Time enough! But since you say it is so bad, I'll e'en go Home and eat a Herring</HI>. Ac∣cordingly he departed, and left her justly confused at her Folly, which had spoilt all the Pains and Expence she had been at.</P>
<P>The following Story, on the Subject of true Politeness, is not unapplicable to the foregoing:</P>
<P>A certain <HI>English</HI> Nobleman, who had the Ho∣nour to be sent Ambassador to <HI>France</HI>, was said
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
to be one of the most polite and best accomplished fine Gentlemen in <HI>Europe</HI>. This reached the Ears of the <HI>French</HI> King, who thought such a Character due to none but himself: But as every thing is proved by Trial, his Majesty took this Method of satisfying his Curiosity. One Morn∣ing, when the Ambassador had a private Audi∣ence, the King told him, he should be glad of his Excellency's Company to take an Airing with him; the Ambassador did not hesitate on accept∣ing the Offer, but told his Majesty he was ready to wait on him; the King's Chariot was at the Door, which he very carelessly desired the No∣bleman to step into: <HI>No, Sir</HI>, replied the Am∣bassador, <HI>not before your Majesty</HI>; at which the King burst out a laughing, and said, <HI>No, no, my Lord, you are not the best bred Man in the World; otherwise you would have done what I de∣sired; since you might well know, that if it was not agreeable to me, I should not have paid you the Compliment</HI>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the Peculiarities in Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>'s Behaviour on many Occasions, there is discover∣able, even among those Oddities, the Marks of a very praise-worthy Disposition, as will appear by the following Relations.</P>
<P>The Dean standing one Winter's Day at the Deanry Window, saw a very poor and ancient Woman sitting on the Steps, shivering with Cold. His Footman happened to come to the Door; when the poor Creature besought him, in a pite∣ous Tone, to deliver a Petition, which she held in her Hand, to his Reverence. The Servant read it, and told her, with infinite Scorn, his Master had something else to mind than her Pe∣tition. <HI>What's that you say, Fellow</HI>, said the
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
Dean, looking out at the Window, <HI>come up here</HI>. The Man trembling obeyed him: He also de∣sired the poor Woman to come before him, made her sit down, and ordered her some Bread and Wine; after which he turned to the Man, and said, <HI>At what Time, Sir, did I order you to open a Paper directed to me? or to refuse a Letter from any one? Hark ye, Sirrah, you have been admo∣nished by me for Drunkenness, Idling, and other Faults; but since I have discovered your inhuman Disposition, I must dismiss you from my Service. So pull off my Cloaths, take your Wages, and let me hear no more from you</HI>.— The Fellow did so, and having vainly sollicited a written Dis∣charge, (which is customarily given in <HI>Ireland</HI> to Servants, when dismissed from a Place,) was compelled to go to Sea, where he continued five Years; at the End of which Time, finding that Life far different from the Ease and Luxury of his former Occupation, he returned, and humbly confessing, in a Petition to the Dean, his former Transgressions, and assuring him of his entire Reformation, which the Dangers he had under∣gone at Sea had happily wrought, he begged the Dean would give him some Sort of a Discharge. Accordingly the Doctor called for a Pen and Ink, and gave him the following Dismission, with which he set out for <HI>London</HI>.</P>

<P><PB N="27" REF="31"/>When the above Servant arrived in <HI>London</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> was there, to whom he applied to recommend him to a Place; and she advised him to go to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>, who, on seeing the Dean's Hand-writing, which he well knew, told the Man, if he could produce any credible Per∣son who would attest that he was the Servant the Dean meant, he would hire him. The Man applying to Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI>, she gave him a Let∣ter to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>, assuring him, that she knew the Man to have been Footman to the Dean; upon which Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> took him into his Service, wherein he continued to the Death of his Ma∣ster.</P>
<P>The following is another of the Dean's sensi∣ble Oddities. He one Day summoned a <HI>Senatus Consultum</HI>, as he called a few of those very inti∣mate Friends whom he peculiarly regarded; and placing them round a great Table, he told them they were an impanneled Jury, and seated himself at the Head of it, as Judge. He then told them the Reason why they were summoned; which was, that his Friend Mr. <HI>Gratton</HI>'s favou∣rite Hen was put to Death by an unlucky Stroke of a Whip, by one of his Fellows, as he sup∣posed. I have accused them, says he, and they deny the Fact; but as Murder will always come to Light, I found the Hen's Head and Neck in the Seat of my Chaise-Box; and now I want to convict the Criminal. Accordingly he ordered his three Men Servants to come before the Com∣pany, and related the following Story to them:— When Dr. <HI>Donne</HI>, afterwards Dean of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, took Possession of the first Living he ever had, being a speculative Man, he took a Walk into the Church-yard, where the Sexton was digging
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
a Grave, and throwing up a Skull, the Doctor took it up to contemplate thereon, and found a small Sprig, or headless Nail, sticking in the Temple, which he drew out secretly, and wrapt it up in the Corner of his Handkerchief: He then demanded of the Grave-digger, Whether he knew whose Skull that was? He said he did very well; declaring it was a Man's who kept a Brandy-Shop, an honest drunken Fellow, who one Night taking too much of that comfortable Creature, was found dead in his Bed the next Morning. Had he a Wife? said the Doctor. Yes, Sir. Is she living? Yes. What Charac∣ter does she bear? A very good one; only in∣deed the Neighbours reflected on her, because she married the Day after her Husband was buried; though to be sure she had no great Reason to grieve after him. This was enough for the Doctor, who, under Pretence of visiting all his Parishioners, called on her; he asked her several Questions, and among others, what Sickness her first Husband died of? She giving him the same Account he had before received, he suddenly opened the Handkerchief, and cried, in an autho∣ritative Voice, <HI>Woman, do you know this Nail?</HI> She was struck with Horror at the unexpected Demand, and instantly owned the Fact. <HI>And so, Fellow</HI>, said the Dean, <HI>do you know this Head?</HI> The Criminal confessed his Fault, and the Jury brought him in <HI>Guilty of Hen-slaughter in his own Defence</HI>, for he declared he was hun∣gry, and did eat it, having no Malice perpense to it, but rather Love. On account of his Sin∣cerity, and the Company's Intercession, the Dean pardoned him.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="33"/>Dean <HI>Swift</HI> has been frequently called the <HI>English Rabelais</HI>; but with Submission to the <HI>French</HI>, and their Admirers, we apprehend they pay <HI>Swift</HI> but an indifferent Compliment by the Comparison; as <HI>Rabelais</HI> was rather a Buffoon than a Man of Sterling Wit, sound Judgment, extensive Knowlege, and deep Learning, as the Dean most certainly was; nor were any of the Oddities of the latter marked with Buffoonry and Indelicacy, as most of those of the former were, as appears by the two following Instances, which we have translated and inserted here, for the sake of giving the <HI>English</HI> Reader an Idea of the fa∣vourite <HI>French</HI> Wit.</P>
<P><HI>Rabelais</HI> one Day walking in the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI>, had pressing Occasion to go to a Necessary-House; but not knowing any Body in the Street where he was taken, a Thought came sud∣denly into his Head, in order to relieve his pre∣sent Necessity, and at the same Time to afford himself Matter of Merriment: He went into an Upholsterer's Shop, just at Hand, and asked him whether he sold Close-Stools? The Man answered, Yes, and immediately shewed him one. <HI>Have you none handsomer than this?</HI> says <HI>Rabelais; shew me some covered genteelly with dif∣ferent coloured Velvets</HI>. While the Shopkeeper went backwards to fetch them, <HI>Rabelais</HI> let down his Breeches, and made use of that which was first brought to him. The Upholsterer returning with the others, and seeing him in such a Posture, called out, <HI>Sir, Sir, What are you about? Only trying it</HI>, answered <HI>Rabelais:</HI> Then putting up his Breeches, he walked away, saying, <HI>They will not do for me; they are all too low</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="34"/>Another Time, upon a like Occasion, the said Jester went under a Gate-way, it being at Night, and eas'd himself in his Servant's Hat, and ordered the Fellow to walk before him with it under his Arm: The Master following at a little Distance, was resolved to treat himself with a Laugh, at the Expence of a Baker, whose Shop he was just passing by. He went to the Baker, and told him (pointing to his Lacquey,) <HI>That Fellow has stole a Loaf off your Bulk, and conceals it in his Hat, under his Arm</HI>. Away ran the poor Baker after the Servant, and seizing the Hat, hastily thrust his Hand in, think∣ing to secure his Loaf; but his Senses of Feel∣ing and Smelling soon convinced him of his Dis∣appointment, to the great Mortification of the Baker, and to the no small Entertainment of <HI>Rabelais</HI>.</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> had been reading, one Even∣ing, at the <HI>Dean</HI>'s House, by his Command, some of his prosaic Works, when she acquitted herself so well, that he said he would give her a Glass of his best Wine; and sent her Husband into the Cellar for it. The Dean, in the mean Time, said to her,
<Q>“I would have every Man ”write his own <HI>English</HI>.</Q>
— To be sure, Sir, (said she,) "that would be best."—
<Q>“Ay, to be sure, Sir, (retorts the Dean,) you answer me, and a P—x take you, I am sure you do not un∣”derstand my Meaning.</Q>
—"Very possible, Sir, (said Mrs. <HI>Pilkington,)</HI>
<Q>“but I certainly under∣”stand my own when I have any.</Q>
—
<Q>“Well, then (says <HI>Swift)</HI> what do you understand by ”writing one's own <HI>English?</HI></Q>
— Why, really,
<Q>“Sir, (replied she,) not to confine one's self to a Set of Phrases, as some of our ancient His∣torians have done, but to make use of such ”Words as naturally occur on the Subject.</Q> —
<Q>“Hush, (says he,) your Husband is coming;
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
”and I will put the same Question to him.</Q>
He did so; and Mr. <HI>Pilkington</HI> answered,
<Q>“To be ”sure a Man ought to write good <HI>English</HI>.</Q>
—
<Q>“Nay, but, (says the Dean,) his own <HI>English</HI>; I say his own; what do you understand by ”that?</Q>
—
<Q>“Why, Sir, (said Mr. <HI>Pilkington)</HI> ”what should I understand?</Q>
<HI>P—x on you for a Dunce</HI> (says <HI>Swift) were your Wife and you to sit for a Fellowship, I would give her one, sooner than admit you a Sizar</HI>.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Pilkington</HI> used to relate the following Matters of Merriment.</P>
<P>A <HI>Frenchman</HI>, who spoke very broken <HI>English</HI>, having some Words with his Wife, endeavoured to call her <HI>Bitch</HI>, but could not recollect the Name; at last he thought he had done it, by saying, <HI>Begar, mine Deare, but you be one damn'd Dog's Wife</HI>. Aye, that's true enough, answer∣ed the Woman, the more's my Misfortune.</P>
<P>A Man telling his Friend the Situation of his Affairs, with Regard to his Creditors, who were somewhat pressing on him, said that his Debts were mostly in Fives and Sixes, (meaning so many Pounds.) <HI>Well</HI> (answers his good-natured Friend,) <HI>since your Affairs are not at</HI> Sixes and Sevens <HI>yet, cheer up, I'll stand your Friend</HI>.</P>
<P>A Gentleman, who was very morose and ill-natured at home in his Family, was remarkably facetious and merry abroad, insomuch that he was more than ordinarily entertaining where∣ever he went; which occasioned a Lady once, at a merry Meeting where he was, to say to one present, who knew him well; <HI>Surely, if that Gentleman is married, his Wife must be extremely happy; for he is quite</HI> the Fiddle of the Com∣pany.
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
<HI>Very true, Madam</HI>, (says the Person she spoke to,) <HI>but he always hangs his Fiddle up at the Door when he goes home</HI>.</P>
<P>A Lady of Quality's Woman, who was mighty ignorant, and very much affected the Use of hard Words and odd Simile's, having been slighted by the <HI>Valet-de-Chambre</HI>, who had once made Love to her, she encouraged the Addresses of the Butler, who offered himself as her Humble Servant; the Valet, notwithstanding he had been very cool towards her before, could not bear to see a Rival, (a common Thing in Matters of Love) began to be sweet upon her again; but Madam pushed him away, with a second-hand genteel Scorn, saying at the same Time, with an affected Air, <HI>Pray forbear your</HI> Redresses <HI>to me, Fellow; it is true, I lov'd you once as if Hea∣ven and Earth were coming together; but now I value you no more than an Apple's like an Oyster</HI>.</P>
<P>A Clergyman of a facetious Turn of Mind, who lived in <HI>Sussex</HI>, a Coast on which Ship∣wrecks have frequently happened; and where, upon such Occasions, the Inhabitants, instead of assisting the Unfortunate in their Distress, used to plunder all they could lay Hands on, and treat the People ill; and were so keen at the News of a Wreck, that they would leave all Manner of Business to plunder. A Misfortune of this Kind happening one <HI>Sunday</HI>, during the Time of Di∣vine Service, the Alarm was given, <HI>A Wreck! A Wreck!</HI> upon which they began to scamper out with great Precipitation; which our Parson perceiving, opened the Pulpit Door, and walk∣ing down the Stairs, called out at the same Time, with a loud Voice, <HI>Brethren, let me intreat you to hear five Words more</HI>. They turned about
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
with impatient Attention, to hear what the Preacher had to say; who making hastily up to them, said, <HI>Let us all start fair:</HI> Which odd Be∣haviour had the desired Effect; as he meant only to go with them, in order to prevent their abu∣sing the Ship's Crew, which often happened.</P>
<P>A Man paying a Visit to some Friends in the North of <HI>Ireland</HI>, they made him very welcome, but caused him to drink so exceeding hard, that he wished himself at home again, saying, <HI>he was sure that if he lived there</HI> long, <HI>he should die</HI> soon.</P>
<P>On a Benefit Night at the Playhouse, many particular Friends of the Actor were let<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in at a private Door, before the great Doors were open; which when discovered, a Gentleman cried out, in a Passion, <HI>It is a Shame they should fill the House full of People before any Body came</HI>.</P>
<P>An Apothecary at <HI>S—y</HI>, who took great Pleasure in humbugging the Country Fellows, or, in short, any body else that was fit for his Purpose, passing through the Market-Place, saw a Fellow standing idle, and gaping about him. <HI>Honest Man</HI>, (says he,) <HI>you seem to have nothing to do; and if that is the Case, I can give you a little Employment, which you may do at your Lei∣sure</HI>. The Fellow scratching his Head, made his Scrape, and thanked him for the Favour in∣tended. The Apothecary then proceeded to tell him, that in his Way of Practice he had Occa∣sion to use large Black Rats, and it was a hard Matter to procure them in Town; therefore if he (the Countryman) would make it his Business to hunt for them in the Barns, Malthouses, &amp;c. in the Country, he would give him Half a Crown a-piece for as many as he could get. The Fel∣low,
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
quite overjoyed at the News of so profit∣able an Employment, was in Haste to be gone, and, after taking the Apothecary's Direction, marched off with great Expedition. The Apo∣thecary, on his Part, was full as well pleased at the Fellow's swallowing the Hum so greedily; and immediately went to communicate the Laugh to his Friends. In short, in about a Fortnight af∣ter, the poor Countryman came to the Apothe∣cary's House, laden with a Sack full of Rats, and addressing himself to him, told him he had at length got together as large a Quantity of Rats as he could, and that they were alive, and in good Condition. The Apothecary, who had practised many little Matters of Merriment of the same Kind, since he had set this Affair on Foot, had quite forgot it; however, being al∣ways ready to carry on a Joke, he told the Fel∣low, that he had delayed procuring them so long, that he had been obliged to furnish himself else∣where, and that at present he himself had no Occasion for them, but recommended him to one of the same Profession in Town, who, he pretended would be glad to buy them. Away trudges the Countryman, but to no Purpose, for the Person he was directed to made the same Ex∣cuse, and sent him to another; and as they were all in the Secret, the poor Fellow was bandied about from one to another almost the whole Day, lugging the wicked Load from Place to Place. At length the Fellow, perceiving that he was only made a Fool of, returned to the Apo∣thecary who employed him to catch the Rats, and told him, that all the Gentlemen he had been with, were provided; and that rather than lose his Labour, he would sell them for a Shilling
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
a-piece. The Apothecary answered, that for his Part he had enough already: The Man then told him, he should have them for Six-pence each; but the other still urged that he was sup∣plied. <HI>Well</HI>, (says the Fellow,) <HI>since you will not buy them, sooner than carry them any farther, I will make you a Present of them</HI>; so opening the Sack, he let out all the Rats in the Shop: The Creatures, loosed from Confinement, in a strange Place, flew and tore about the Shop and Parlour at a wicked Rate, destroying Bottles, Glasses, Gallipots, China, &amp;c. to the great Mortification of the Apothecary, and to the high Satisfaction of the Country Fellow. In short, the former has not, since that Time, been so keen at hum∣bugging as usual; and the latter presently <HI>smells a Rat</HI>, when People endeavour to impose upon him.</P>
<P>A Gentleman having made an Entertainment for some Friends, one of the Servants carrying a Neat's Tongue up Stairs to the Dining-Room, he stumbled, and the Tongue slipt out of the Dish; the Master hearing the Clatter, went to the Stair-head to know the Cause, which being informed of, was somewhat angry; but the Fel∣low begg'd Pardon, and said, he hoped he should be excused, as it was only a <HI>Lapsus Linguae</HI>, (a Slip of the Tongue;) which facetious Turn so pleased the Gentleman and his Company, that his Wit was rewarded by the Gift of a Shilling a-piece from all present. Another waiting at Table at the same Time, and seeing the Re∣ward conferred on his Fellow-Servant, remem∣bering the Words, was determined to try his Luck, and accordingly being sent up with a Sir-Loin of Beef, he stumbled on Purpose, and the
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
Joint fell out of the Dish; which greatly pro∣voked the Gentleman; when the ignorant Block-head said it was only a <HI>Lapsus Linguae</HI>; for which he got a hearty Drubbing, and was kick'd down Stairs.</P>
<P>Two Citizens disputing which of them was the best Scholar, one told the other he would lay him a Wager, he did not know what was <HI>Latin</HI> for a Goose. <HI>Perhaps not</HI>, (answered the other,) <HI>but if my Son was here, he would give you an im∣mediate</HI> Anser, (which is <HI>Latin</HI> for a Goose.)</P>
<P>A Gentleman seeing another, sitting in a Ne∣cessary-House, with a Book in his Hand reading very attentively, said, he was sorry his Memory was so bad, that he could not <HI>sh—te without Book</HI>.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>C—d</HI>, a Nobleman of too much Fortitude and Greatness of Soul to be shaken with every Breath, was in <HI>Ireland</HI> during the late Rebellion in <HI>Scotland</HI>, and one Morning, when it was reported that the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks were about to rise, a Gentleman ran into his Chamber very abruptly, <HI>My Lord, my Lord, we're undone</HI>, says he, <HI>all</HI> Ireland <HI>are expected to be up immediately. Why, what's o'Clock?</HI> says the Nobleman. <HI>Ten, my Lord</HI>, answered the Gen∣tleman. <HI>Well then, truly</HI>, says his Lordship, very calmly, <HI>I'll get up myself, for I think every Man should be up at ten o'Clock</HI>.</P>
<P>The same Nobleman being informed by some officious Person, that his Coachman went to Mass, he answered, with a Smile, <HI>Does he so, well I promise you he shall never drive me there</HI>.</P>
<P>A Dog running open-mouth'd at a Serjeant on a March, he ran the Spear of his Halbert down his Throat, and killed him on the Spot. The Owner coming out, raved extremely at the Death
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>

<P>A YOUNG Fellow, walking through the Streets of <HI>Paris</HI>, chanced to espy a Purse with Money in it lying near a Church Door, which he joyfully pocketed; and soon after meeting with some Friends he acquainted them with his good Fortune, and invited them to take a Glass with him on the chearful Occasion, at an adjacent
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
Tavern, which they readily accepted. In the mean time the Man who had lost the Purse, making careful and diligent Enquiry, got In∣telligence of the Manner of its being found, and where the Person was who found it.</P>
<P>Away flies the Owner of the Purse to a proper Officer, who attended him to the Place where these merry Blades were regaling over a Bottle; and demanded if any one there had found a Purse.</P>
<P>The present Possessor had not Assurance enough to deny the Fact, but readily pulls it out, and tendered it to the Owner, begs the Favour of him to tell his Money over, and assures him, that there was but one Crown melted, which was metamorphosed into Claret, for the Entertain∣ment of himself and Friends.</P>
<P>The Gentleman insisted on Restitution to a Farthing. The Delinquent not having any Money in his Pocket, to answer the Demand, the whole House was in an Uproar.</P>
<P>The Constable attempted to secure him, but the young Fellow being strong and active, got from him, ran out of the House, and the Con∣stable, &amp;c. after him. Crossing the Street in his hasty Flight, he unluckily ran against a Tradesman's Wife, who was big with Child, which threw her down, and greatly frightened her.</P>
<P>He still continued his Flight, and seeing a Ladder, which stood against a House then re∣pairing, he ran up it, but the Constable shaking it below when the other was near the Top, he tumbled down upon him, and broke the Con∣stable's Arm.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="50"/>Being now secured, he was carried before a Magistrate, where all the Sufferers appeared in a Body against him. He that lost his Purse, the Husband of the big-bellied Woman, and the Constable with his broken Arm. All loudly in∣veterate against the young Fellow, in hopes of getting themselves rewarded, and him pu∣nished.</P>
<P>The Justice well weighing the Allegations, thought the Man not very culpable, but that the Disasters which had happened were rather the Effects of mere Accident than a bad Disposition, he thus settled the Affair:</P>
<P>That since the Prisoner had embezzled Part of the Prosecutor's Money, and that the latter had refused the Remainder, he (the Prisoner) should keep what he had, 'till he was able and willing to restore the whole. Then turning to the Husband of the Woman with Child, he told him that if his Wife was dangerously hurt, the Prisoner should pay the Physician, and if she should miscarry, he should be obliged to cohabit with her, till she was was as far gone with Child, as she was before her Miscarriage; and as to Mr. Constable, whose Heart was ready to burst with Anger and Avarice, the Justice told him, that according to the Law of <HI>Lex Talionis</HI>, he might, if he pleased, ascend the Ladder, and tumble down upon the Prisoner and break his Arm in the same Manner. This impartial De∣cision pleased all the Hearers except the Com∣plainants, who were horridly chagrined at being disappointed of the Fines they expected would be levied on the young Fellow.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>SWEARER RECLAIMED;</HI> or a pleasant Way of working the Reforma∣tion of a Sinner. From the <HI>French</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>THREE merry Companions being met toge∣ther to spend an Evening; after Supper, they sat down to play at Hazard. One of them had ac∣quired a Habit of Swearing to such a Degree, that he could hardly forbear it in common Con∣versation, but if any Way provoked, would swear immoderately. It fell out that Luck run against him, and at every Throw he lost; he cursed and blasphemed in such a shocking Manner, that his Companions were frightened to hear him, and the more they reprehended him, the more he swore. At length, having lost all his Money, he drew towards the Fire, and soon after fell fast asleep. The other two, who still continued their Play, hear∣ing him snore, they contrived an innocent De∣vice to reclaim him, if possible, from swearing for the future. They put out the Candles, and extinguished the Fire, so that there was not a Spark of Light to be seen; and then pretended to dispute about a Throw which they feigned to be doubtful. They made such a Noise in their sham Quarrel, that their Companion started from his Sleep, rubbing his Eyes and seeing no Light, ask∣ed how they could play without a Candle. Poh, Poh, said they, you are not awake yet, and pre∣tended to play on without regarding him. Just as he was dosing a second Time, they feigned another Dispute on the Cast of a Dye, and wak∣ed him to decide it. He opened his Eyes, but still seeing no Light, he said, How would you
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
have me judge when there is no Candle to see by; Pshaw, said they, rub your Eyes: Which he did several Times, and wished the Devil might fetch him if he could see the least Glimmering. They counterfeited great Astonishment, and asked him seriously if he was not making Game. He an∣swered, Let me die if I am. Reach the Candle, says one of the Humbuggers to the other, which he held before the Fellow's Eyes, unlighted, and asked him if he saw the Candle; he protested he did not; they seemed wonderfully surprized, and assured him his Eyes to all Appearance looked clear and well. The Man now began to be ter∣rified; which his Companions perceiving, were resolved to improve: Ah, says one of them, It is to be feared, that the horrid Blasphemies you have uttered against Heaven, has brought down this Judgment of Blindness upon you. The Fellow cried and roared bitterly, and prayed Forgiveness of his Sins, which his Companions earnestly re∣commended to him, and leading him to a Bed in the Room, took their Leave. He sighed, groan∣ed, vowed, and prayed the greater Part of the Night; made very solemn Promises of abandon∣ing his Sins; and at last fell asleep. When he awaked in the Morning, just about Peep of Day, he thought his Sight was returning by Degrees, in Consequence of his Prayers and Vows; this Opi∣nion his Friends agreed with him in, so that he really thought a Miracle had been wrought on him. In short, he entirely left off swearing, and led a good and virtuous Life.</P>

<P>THOU best beloved of all my Daughters! observe the Precepts of thy Father: Learn Wis∣dom from his Experience. Tho', like the Cedars planted at thy Nativity, thou art now in the full Bloom of Youth and Beauty, and hast seen but one hundred and fifty Years; yet be∣times consider, that thou wast born to die, and must, like them, decay and perish, and return to Dust. How short is life! what are seven or eight hundred Years, which few exceed, if no Acci∣dents cut them off before! And to what nume∣rous Accidents is Life exposed! Thy Mother dy'd in bearing Thee, just in her Prime and Vigour, when she had scarce reach'd four hun∣dred Years; of one hundred and sixty Children which she left me, but ninety now remain; the rest are all as if they had never been. Re∣member this; and in Youth be mindful of thy Duty to that invisible and uncreated Being, who, after this transitory Existence, can make thee live for evermore. Let not the Flatteries of Men swell thee up with Vanity and Pride, nor believe them when they call thy Charms immortal. They tell thee what is not; a little while will assuredly prove them Liars; for Nothing more certainly takes its Flight than Beauty. Many whom now thóu seest decay'd and withered, not above two or three hundred Years ago, were as thou art now, admired and courted. Learn then from them what thou shalt be; and since Beauty will not continue, improve thy
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
Mind with Piety and Virtue: Thus shalt thou be always lovely. My Days past are eight-hundred and twenty Years, and soon must I lie down in Darkness with my Fathers <HI>Enoch, Se∣thos</HI>, and <HI>Addamah</HI>, the unbegotten and first of Men. The Earth arose from <HI>Chaos</HI> but fifteen hundred Years ago, and yet all these are dead: I too must follow, and you must do the same. Every Thing I see informs me of Mortality: Trees planted at my Birth are long ago con∣verted into Dust: Marble hewn from the hard Rocks, and Metals taken from the Mine, in my Remembrance, are worn out and moul∣der'd quite away: Houses have been thrice re∣built since I laid their first Foundations: Moun∣tains are sunk into the Vallies, and Rivers have chang'd their Course within my Memory. No∣thing can endure for ever, but he who had no Beginning: Mankind must be cast again in the Womb of Nature, as well as Stones and Me∣tals. At present thou art young and beautiful; but Age and Death must come. Of this be al∣ways mindful, and puff not thyself with Pride, nor waste thy Days in Foolishness; for Time can never be recalled; once gone, 'tis gone for ever∣more.</P>
<P><HI>I doubt not but my gentle Readers will think it exceeding strange, that People who had lived so many hundred Years, should be so sollicitous about the Use of Time, and talk of Dying; whereas our Beaux and modern Ladies (tho' Life is shortened to less than a tenth Part) find more of it on their Hands than they well know what to do with, and squander it away as if they were to live for ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Dismal Effects of <HI>FORCED MARRIAGES</HI>. A melancholy <HI>TALE</HI>.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The following remarkable Story has its Foundation in Fact, and is still preserved in a curious Painting in <HI>Coucy-Castle</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> (not∣withstanding such a long Succession of Years,) quite fresh to this Day.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ABOVE a hundred Years ago, there dwelt in <HI>France</HI> one Captain <HI>Coucy</HI>, a gallant Gentle∣man, of ancient and noble Extraction, and Keeper of <HI>Coucy</HI> Castle, which is yet standing, and in good Repair. He fell in Love with a young Lady, and paid her honourable Courtship: There was a reciprocal Affection between them; but her Parents having a more advantageous Match in View, forcibly married her to one Monsieur <HI>Fayel</HI>, who was a Man of immense Fortune, but no way agreeable to the young Lady. Capt. <HI>Coucy</HI>, upon this disagreeable E∣vent, immediately quitted <HI>France</HI>; and the Lady, who was now Mademoiselle <HI>Fayel</HI>, laboured un∣der continual Discontent of Mind. Capt. <HI>Coucy</HI> went to the Wars in <HI>Hungary</HI> against the <HI>Turks</HI>, and in the Battle near <HI>Buda</HI> received a mortal Wound. Being carried to his Quarters, he lan∣guished a few Days, and then expired: But a little before his Death, he called an old, trusty Servant to the Bed-side, and told him that he had had many Proofs of his Fidelity and Truth, but now he had a great Concern to entrust him with, which he conjured him by all Means to execute; which was, that after his Death he should get his
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
Body opened, and then take his Heart out, and put it in an earthen Pot to be baked to Powder; then to put the Powder into a handsome Box, with a Bracelet of Hair that he had long worn about his Wrist (which was a Lock of Made∣moiselle <HI>Fayel</HI>'s,) together with a Note he had written with his own Blood to her; and after he had given him the Rites of Burial, to make all the Speed he could to <HI>France</HI>, and deliver the said Box to Mademoiselle <HI>Fayel</HI>. The faithful Servant did as his departed Master had com∣manded, and so went to <HI>France</HI>; and going into Mons. <HI>Fayel</HI>'s House, he was seen by that Gen∣tleman, who knowing him to be Captain <HI>Coucy</HI>'s Servant, examined what his Business was; and finding him equivocate, and faulter in his Speech, ordered him to be searched; and the little Box, with the Powder, Bracelet, and Note, were found upon him. The Bearer was dismissed with Me∣naces, and charged not to come near the House for the future.</P>
<P>Mons. <HI>Fayel</HI> immediately sent for his Cook, and delivered him the Powder, charging him to make a little well-relished Dish of it, without losing a Jot of it, for it was a very costly thing; and commanded him to bring it in himself, after the last Course at Supper. The Cook brought in the Dish accordingly, and Mons. <HI>Fayel</HI> ordered all but his Wife to leave the Room, and began a serious Discourse with her; telling her, that he had observed that she had a continual Melan∣choly rooted in her Heart; that he saw she had been constantly pining ever since her Marriage; and that he plainly perceived she was entering into a Consumption; therefore he had provided a very precious Cordial, which he was well as∣sured
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
would cure her. At his Entreaty she took the little Preparation, and eat it; and afterwards she much importuning him to know what it was, he told her she had eaten <HI>Coucy</HI>'s Heart, and so drew the Box out of his Pocket, and shewed her the Letter and the Bracelet. In a sudden Exul∣tation of gloomy Joy, she cried out, <HI>This is a precious Cordial, indeed!</HI> and eagerly lick'd the Dish; saying, <HI>It is so precious, that 'tis pity that any Meat should ever be put upon it</HI>. So she went to Bed, and in the Morning was found dead.</P>

<HEAD>The shocking Consequences arising from <HI>JEA∣LOUSY</HI>. Founded on Fact.</HEAD>
<P>DON <HI>Alonzo</HI>, a <HI>Spanish</HI> Nobleman, had a beautiful and virtuous Wife, with whom he had lived for some Years in great Tranquillity. The Gentleman, however, was not freed from the Faults usually imputed to that Nation; he was proud, jealous, and impetuous. He kept a <HI>Moor</HI> in his House, whom, on a Complaint from his Lady, he had punished, for a small Offence, with the utmost Severity. The Slave vowed Re∣venge, and communicated his Resolution to one of the Lady's Women, with whom he lived in a criminal Way. This Creature also hated her Mistress, for she feared she was observed by her; she therefore undertook to make Don <HI>Alonso</HI> jea∣lous, by insinuating that the Gardener was often admitted to his Lady in private, and promising to make him an Eye-Witness of it. At a pro∣per Time agreed on between her and the <HI>Mo∣risco</HI>, she sent a Message to the Gardener, that his Lady having some hasty Orders to give him, would have him come that Moment to her in
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
her Chamber. In the mean Time she had placed <HI>Alonso</HI> privately in an outer Room, that he might observe who passed that Way. It was not long before he saw the Gardener appear. <HI>Alonso</HI> had not Patience, but following him into the A∣partment, struck him at one Blow with a Dag∣ger to the Heart; then dragging his Lady by the Hair, without enquiring further, he instantly killed her.</P>
<P>Here he paused, looking on the dead Bodies with all the Agitations of a Daemon of Re∣venge; when the Wench who had occasioned these Terrors, distracted with Remorse, threw herself at his Feet, and in a Voice of Lamenta∣tion, without Sense of the Consequence, repea∣ted all her Guilt. <HI>Alonso</HI> was overwhelmed with all the violent Passions at one Instant, and utter∣ing the broken Voices and Motions of each of them, for a Moment, till at last he recollected himself enough to end his Agony of Love, An∣ger, Disdain, Revenge, and Remorse, by mur∣dering the Maid, the <HI>Moor</HI>, and himself.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKABLE ANECDOTES, WITTICISMS, AND PIECES in PROSE and VERSE, OF The inimitable Dr. SWIFT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Passages strongly mark the Character of this great Man, and will doubtless afford much Pleasure to every sensible Reader.</P>
<P>LET it be recorded (says the ingenious Wri∣ter of the Dean's Life,) to the Honour of Dr. <HI>Swift</HI>, and to animate others by his Example and Reward, that during his Connection with those who were in the highest Rank, and who in every Rank would have been great, he would never suffer himself to be treated but as an Equal, and repulsed every Attempt to hold him in Depen∣dance, or keep him at a Distance, with the ut∣most Resentment and Indignation.</P>
<P>It happened upon some Occasion, that <HI>Harley</HI> sent him a Bank Bill of Fifty Pounds by his pri∣vate
<PB N="72" REF="76"/>
Secretary, Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI>, which <HI>Swift</HI> instantly returned, with a Letter of Expostulation and Complaint. <HI>Harley</HI> invited him to dine, but he refused: He wrote to Mr. <HI>Lewis</HI> to mediate be∣tween them, desiring to be reconciled; but <HI>Swift</HI> sent him word, that he expected further Satis∣faction. <HI>Harley</HI> replied, if he would come and see him, he would make him easy; but <HI>Swift</HI> in∣sisted he should apologize by Message, and de∣clared, that otherwise he <HI>would cast him off</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Swift</HI> would not suffer even negative Incivili∣ties from those, who, if by their Station they had not been his Superiors, would have been his Equals by Learning and Parts. It happened that having one Day dined with Mr. <HI>St. John</HI>, who was then Secretary of State, and remarked that he appeared to be much out of Temper, he took the first Opportunity to see him alone, and warn∣ed him never to behave to him with silent Re∣serve, for that he would not be treated like a School-boy. <HI>I expect</HI> (says he,) <HI>that if you hear or see any thing to my Disadvantage, you would let me know it in plain Words, and not put me in Pain to guess, by the Change or Coldness of your Countenance and Behaviour; for it is what I would hardly bear from a crowned Head, and I think no Subject's Favour is worth it.</HI></P>
<P>The Secretary received the Reproof like a Friend, as it was given, and apologized for his Behaviour, by saying that Business had kept him up several whole Nights, and Drinking one more; and, to make up Matters, he pressed the Doctor to stay to Dinner; which, however, he declined, as well because he would not encourage a second Offence by too easily passing over the first, as because he was engaged with another Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="77"/>In a Letter which <HI>Swift</HI> wrote to Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> after the Connection between them was broken, he says,
<Q>“When I was with you, I have said more than once, that I would never allow Quality or Station to make any Difference be∣tween Men. — I loved you just so much the worse for your Station.—In your publick Ca∣pacity you have often angered me to the Heart, but as a private Man never. — I was too proud to be vain of the Honour you did me. — I was never afraid of offending you, nor am I now in any Pain for the Manner I ”write to you in.</Q></P>
<P>This Conduct of the Dean was not the Effect of Pride and Self-Sufficiency, but of true Dignity of Mind; for he exacted nothing which, in his Turn, he did not pay, nor asked more for him∣self than others whose Pretensions or Circum∣stances were the same. When he was desired by Lord <HI>Oxford</HI> to introduce Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI> to his Ac∣quaintance, he refused, upon this Principle, <HI>That a Man of Genius was a Character superior to that of a Lord in High Station</HI>; he therefore obliged his Lordship to walk with his Treasurer's Staff, from Room to Room, through his own Levée, enquiring which was Dr. <HI>Parnell</HI>, in order to in∣troduce himself, and beg the Honour of his Ac∣quaintance.</P>
<P>Upon the Arrival of Lord <HI>Carteret</HI>, who was appointed Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI>, in that Kingdom, soon after Dean <HI>Swift</HI>'s Fourth Let∣ter of the <HI>Draper</HI>, several Passages were selected as sufficient Ground for a Prosecution, and his Excellency and Council published a Proclama∣tion, offering 300<HI>l.</HI> Reward for a Discovery of the Author. This Proclamation gave the Dean
<PB N="74" REF="78"/>
a remarkable Opportunity to illustrate his Cha∣racter. It happened that his Butler, whom he had employed as his Amanuensis, and who alone was trusted with the Secret, went out in the Af∣ternoon of the Day of the Proclamation, with∣out Leave, and staid out the whole Night, and Part of the next Day. There was great Reason to suspect that he had made an Information, and having received his Reward, would never return. The Man, however, came home in the Even∣ing, and the Dean was advised by his Friends to take no Notice of his Fault, lest he should be provoked to a Breach of Trust, from the Dread of which his Return had just delivered them. But the Dean rejected this Counsel with the ut∣most Disdain, and commanding the Man into his Presence, ordered him immediately to strip off his Livery, and leave the House. <HI>You Vil∣lain</HI>, (said he,) <HI>I know I am in your Power, and for that very Reason I will the less bear with your Insolence or Neglect</HI>.</P>
<P>The Man, in very submissive Terms, con∣fessed that he had been drinking all Night, and intreated to be forgiven, but <HI>Swift</HI> was inexora∣ble: He then begged that he might be confined in some Part of the House so long as the Procla∣mation could entitle him to any Reward, lest when he was driven from his Service, and desti∣tute of another, the Temptation might be too strong for his Virtue, and his Distress might in∣volve him in a Crime which he most abhorred. <HI>Swift</HI>, however, was still inexorable, and the Man was dismissed. During all the Time of Danger, <HI>Swift</HI> obstinately refused to contribute one Farthing towards his Support, nor could he be persuaded to see his Face: But when the
<PB N="75" REF="79"/>
Time limited in the Proclamation was expired, he was permitted to return to his Service. Soon afterwards he was called hastily up by the Dean, who, without any Preface, again ordered him to strip off his Livery, put on his own Cloaths, and then come up again. The poor Fellow, tho' he was greatly astonished at this Proceeding, knew <HI>Swift</HI> too well to expostulate, and there∣fore, with whatever Reluctance, obeyed. When he returned, the Dean ordered the other Ser∣vants to be called up, who immediately attend∣ed; expecting that the Butler was to be dismis∣sed <HI>in terrorem</HI>, and that they should be warned, in very severe Terms, of his Offence. <HI>Swift</HI>, as soon as he had ranged th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m together before him, ordered them to take Notice, that <HI>Robert</HI> was no longer his Servant: <HI>He is now</HI>, (said the Dean,) <HI>Mr.</HI> Blakely, <HI>the Verger of</HI> St. Patrick<HI>'s Cathedral, a Place which I give him as a Reward for his Fidelity</HI>. The Value of this Place is be∣tween Thirty and Forty Pounds a Year. How∣ever, <HI>Robert</HI> would not quit his Master, but con∣tinued to be his Butler some Years afterwards.</P>
<P>In this Instance the Dean exercised his Pride, his Fortitude, and his Equity, in a Manner pe∣culiar to himself; and though there are many who would have equally rewarded such Fide∣lity, there are few who would have ventured to wait the Issue of so severe and dangerous a Pro∣bation.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dean</HI> used to remonstrate, with great Freedom, against such Measures as he disappro∣ved; and Lord <HI>Carteret</HI> having gained the Ad∣vantage of him in some Dispute concerning the Distresses of <HI>Ireland</HI>, he cried out, in a violent Passion; <HI>What the Vengeance brought you among
<PB N="76" REF="80"/>
us? Get you gone, get you gone; pray God Al∣mighty send us our Boobies back again.</HI> A Reply, which shewed at once the Turn, the Strength, and the Virtue of his Mind, as it was a fine Compliment to the Force of Reason, by which he had been just foiled, and was expressed with all the Vehemence of his Temper, all the Pecu∣liarity of his Wit.</P>
<P>As <HI>Swift</HI> was zealous to preserve all the Deli∣cacies of Conversation, he was always best plea∣sed when some of the Company were Ladies; and in one of his Letters to Lord <HI>Oxford</HI>, he says, <HI>Since Women have been left out of all our Meetings, except Parties of Play, or where worse Designs are carried on, our Conversation has very much degenerated</HI>. In this Instance, his Exam∣ple is a Reproof to those Pedants, who suppose that Women are never in their proper Sphere, but in the Dressing-Room or Nursery.</P>
<P>The following is an Instance of the Dean's Humanity and Benevolence. — It happened that a young Gentleman of his Choir, being abroad with his Gun, suffered irreparable Hurt by its accidentally going off. When the Dean heard of it, he expressed great Concern, and having paused a little; <HI>Well</HI>, (said he,) <HI>this will be a good Time at once to reward Merit and alleviate Distress; I will make him a Vicar</HI>; which he ac∣cordingly did the same Hour.</P>
<P>The Dean was remarkable for performing the Duties of the Church with the utmost Punctua∣lity and the most rational Devotion, which makes the following Oddities the more remarkable, and shews that, with all his Piety, he could not for∣bear indulging the Peculiarity of his Humour when an Opportunity presented itself, whatever
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
might be the Impropriety of Time and Place. When he went to reside at his Living in the Country of <HI>Ireland</HI>, called <HI>Laracor</HI>, he gave pub∣lick Notice that he would read Prayers on every <HI>Wednesday</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI>; which had never been practised by his Predecessors. On the first <HI>Wed∣nesday</HI> after he had summoned his Congregation at <HI>Laracor</HI>, he ascended his Desk, and having sat some Time, with no other Auditor than his Clerk <HI>Roger</HI>, he rose up, and with a Composure and Gravity that was upon this Occasion irre∣sistibly ridiculous, he began, <HI>Dearly beloved</HI> Ro∣ger, <HI>the Scripture moveth you and me in sundry Places</HI>; and so proceeded to the End of the Service.</P>
<P>Soon after he was made Dean of <HI>St. Patrick</HI>'s, he had dined one <HI>Sunday</HI> with Dr. <HI>Raymond</HI>, Vi∣car of <HI>Trim</HI>, and when the Bell had rung, and the People were assembled to Evening Prayers at the Church, which was not distant more than two Hundred Yards; <HI>Raymond</HI>, said he, I will lay you a Crown, that I begin Prayers before you this Afternoon; Dr. <HI>Raymond</HI> accepted the Wa∣ger, and immediately both run as fast as they could towards the Church. <HI>Raymond</HI>, who was much nimbler than <HI>Swift</HI>, arrived first at the Door, and when he entered the Church, walked decently towards the Reading Desk; <HI>Swift</HI> never slackened hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pace, but running up the Isle, left Dr. <HI>Raymond</HI> behind in the Middle of it, and stepping into the Desk, without putting on a Sur∣plice or opening the Book, began the Service in an audible Voice; and thus won the Wager.</P>
<P>One of the Choristers of <HI>St. Patrick</HI>'s, who was an excellent Singer, but a very indiscreet Man in his Conduct, having contracted some
<PB N="78" REF="82"/>
Debts was obliged to absent himself from his Duty, being afraid to apply for Assistance to the Dean, who had often stood his Friend in his Distresses. However, he ventured at length to appear one <HI>Sunday</HI> Evening at Prayer Time, at the above Cathedral, in order to perform in the Anthem. It happened, accidentally, that the Part which he was to sing, began with the Words, <HI>Where shall I go, whither shall I fly from thy Pre∣sence?</HI> Which, when the Dean (not knowing be∣fore that he was in the Church) heard, he shook his Fist at him, and said, loud enough for all near him to hear, <HI>To Gaol, you Dog, to Gaol</HI>; which greatly alarmed the poor Man, who was more afraid of the Dean's Anger, than of the Resentment of all his Creditors together. How∣ever, after Prayers were over, <HI>Swift</HI>, who had a great Regard for the Chorister, sent for him to the Deanry, and after reproving him severely for his Indiscretions, gave him Money to satisfy all his Debts.</P>
<P>The Dean, who was very intimate with the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI>, Prime Minister in Queen <HI>Anne</HI>'s Reign, and who he thought was too slow in his political Motions, once told him so, in a Man∣ner which shews both his Integrity and Freedom of Conversation with those who have a pre∣scriptive Right to Servility and Adulation. <HI>Swift</HI> had received a Present of a fine Tortoiseshell Snuff-box, lined with Gold, and painted on the Inside of the Lid with a View of <HI>Venice</HI>. This Present he shewed one Day to Lord <HI>Oxford</HI>, who having admired the Painting and Workmanship, at last spied a Figure studded on the Outside of the Bottom, which he thought resembled a Goose; upon which, turning to the Dean, <HI>Jonathan</HI>,
<PB N="79" REF="83"/>
(says he,) <HI>I think they have made a Goose of thee. — Yes, my Lord</HI>, (says the Doctor;) <HI>but if your Lordship will look a little farther, you will see I am driving a Snail before me</HI>; which indeed happened to be the Device. To this the Earl coolly replied, <HI>That is severe enough</HI>, Jonathan; <HI>but I deserve it</HI>.</P>
<P>Dean <HI>Swift</HI> happened to be at the Castle, in <HI>Dublin</HI>, in the Lieutenancy of the Earl of <HI>Pem∣broke</HI>, when a learned Physician was haranguing his Excellency upon the Nature and Qualities of Bees, which he was perpetually calling a Nation and Commonwealth; <HI>Yes, my Lord</HI>, said <HI>Swift, they are a Nation of great Antiquity; you know, my Lord</HI>, Moses <HI>takes Notice of them; he numbers the</HI> Hivites <HI>among the Nations which</HI> Joshua <HI>was appointed to conquer</HI>.</P>
<P>He was another Time in Company with a Lady, whose long Train happened to throw down a fine Fiddle, and break it, upon which he im∣mediately cried out,
<Q><HI>Mantua</HI> vae miscrae nimium vicina <HI>Cremonae</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Dean</HI> being one Day at a Sheriff's Feast, who, after several other Toasts, had been called out to him, <HI>Mr. Dean, The Trade of Ireland</HI>; the Dean turned about and immediately answer∣ed, <HI>Sir, I drink no Memories</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Brown</HI>, Bishop of <HI>Corke</HI>, had just then printed two Pamphlets and several Sermons, in which he zealously con∣demned drinking to Memories.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Swift</HI> greatly admired the Talents of the late Duke of <HI>Wharton</HI>, and hearing him one Day recount many of his Frolicks, <HI>Aye, my Lord</HI>, said he, <HI>you have had many Frolicks; but let me recommend one more to you</HI>, take a Frolick to be virtuous. <HI>I assure you it will do you more Honour than all the rest.</HI></P>

<P>THIS single Stick, which you now behold ingloriously lying in that neglected Corner, I once knew in a flourishing State in a Forest: It was full of Sap, full of Leaves, and full of Boughs: But now in vain does the busy Art of Man pretend to vye with Nature, by tying that withered Bundle of Twigs to its sapless Trunk: It is now at best but the Reverse of what it was, a Tree turned upside down, the Branches on the Earth, and the Root in the Air: It is now han∣dled by every dirty Wench, condemned to do her Drudgery, and, by a capricious Kind of Fate, destined to make her Things clean, and be nasty itself: At length, worn out to the Stumps in the Service of the Maids, it is either thrown out of Doors, or condemned to the last Use, of kindling a Fire. When I beheld this, I sighed, and said within myself, surely mortal Man is a Broom∣stick! Nature sent him into the World strong and lusty, in a thriving Condition, wearing his own Hair on his Head, the proper Branches of this reasoning Vegetable, until the Axe of In∣temperance has lopped off his green Boughs, and left him a withered Trunk: He then flies to Art, and puts on a <HI>Perriwig</HI>, valuing himself upon an

<L>My Dressing none need be afraid of,</L>
<L>But such a Dish was never heard of.</L>
<L>I'll roast it nice;—but shall not boil it,</L>
<L>Let those that know no better, spoil it.</L>
<L>Her Husband cry'd, for all my Boast,</L>
<L>I own the Wager fairly lost.</L>
<L>And other Wives, besides my Love,</L>
<L>Or I'm mistaken much, may prove,</L>
<L>More chargeable than this to me,</L>
<L>To shew their Pride in Housewif'ry.</L>
<L>Now the poor Wretch who next him sat,</L>
<L>Felt his own Heart go pit-a-pat,</L>
<L>For well he knew his Spouse's Way;</L>
<L>Her Spirit brook'd not to obey;</L>
<L>And never yet was in the Wrong;</L>
<L>He told her with a trembling Tongue,</L>
<L>Where, and on what, his Friends would feast;</L>
<L>And how the Dainty should be drest.</L>
<L>To Night? quoth, in a Passion, she;</L>
<L>No, Sirs, to Night it cannot be:</L>
<L><PB N="107" REF="111"/>And was it a <HI>boil'd</HI> Pig you said?</L>
<L>You and your Friends, sure, are not mad!</L>
<L>The Kitchen is the proper Sphere,</L>
<L>Where none but Females should appear:</L>
<L>And Cooks their Orders, by your Leave,</L>
<L>Always from Mistresses receive.</L>
<L>Boil it! was ever such an <HI>Ass!</HI></L>
<L>Pray, what would you desire for Sauce?</L>
<L>If any Servant in my Pay</L>
<L>Dare dress a <HI>Pig</HI> that silly Way,</L>
<L>In spite of any Whim of your's,</L>
<L>I'll turn them quickly out of Doors,</L>
<L>For no such thing —nay, never frown,</L>
<L>Where I am Mistress, shall be done.</L>
<L>Each Woman wise her Husband rules,</L>
<L>Passive Obedience is for Fools.</L>
<L>This Case was quickly judg'd! behold</L>
<L>A fair One of a softer Mould;</L>
<L>Good Humour sparkled in her Eye,</L>
<L>And unaffected Pleasantry.</L>
<L>So mild and sweet she enter'd in,</L>
<L>Her Spouse thought certainly to win.</L>
<L>Pity such Golden Hopes should fail!</L>
<L>Soon as she heard th' appointed Tale;</L>
<L>My Dear, I know not, I protest,</L>
<L>Whether in Earnest or in Jest,</L>
<L>So strange a Supper you demand;</L>
<L>Howe'er I'll not disputing stand,</L>
<L>But do't as freely as you bid it,</L>
<L>Prove but that ever Woman did it.</L>
<L>This Cause by general Consent,</L>
<L>Was lost for want of Precedent.</L>
<L>Thus each deny'd a several Way;</L>
<L>But all agreed to disobey.</L>
<L>One only Dame did yet remain,</L>
<L>Who downright honest was, and plain:</L>
<L><PB N="108" REF="112"/>If now and then her Voice she tries,</L>
<L>'Tis not for Rule, but Exercise.</L>
<L>Unus'd her Lord's Commands to slight,</L>
<L>Yet sometimes pleading for the Right,</L>
<L>She made her little Wisdom go</L>
<L>Farther than wiser Women do.</L>
<L>Her Husband tells her, looking grave,</L>
<L>A roasting <HI>Pig</HI> I boil'd would have;</L>
<L>And, to prevent all <HI>Pro</HI> and <HI>Con</HI>,</L>
<L>I must insist to have it done.</L>
<L>Says she, my Dearest, shall your Wife</L>
<L>Get a Nickname to last for Life?</L>
<L>If you resolve to spoil it, do;</L>
<L>But I desire you'll eat it too:</L>
<L>For tho' 'tis boil'd to hinder Squabble,</L>
<L>I shall not, will not, sit at Table.</L>
<L>She spoke, and her good Man alone</L>
<L>Found he had neither lost nor won,</L>
<L>So fairly parted Stakes. The rest</L>
<L>Fell on the Wag that caus'd the Jest:</L>
<L>Would <HI>your</HI> Wife boil it? Let us see.</L>
<L>Hold there—you did not lay with me;</L>
<L>You find, in spite of all you boasted,</L>
<L>Your <HI>Pigs</HI> are fated to be roasted.</L>
<L>The Wager lost no more contend,</L>
<L>But take this Counsel from a Friend:</L>
<L>Boast not your Empire, if you prize it,</L>
<L>For happiest he that never tries it.</L>
<L>Wives unprovok'd, think not of Sway,</L>
<L>Without commanding they obey;</L>
<L>But if your dear Ones take the Field,</L>
<L>Resolve at once to win or yield;</L>

<L>YOUR Sage and Moralist can shew,</L>
<L>Many Misfortunes here Below,</L>
<L>A Truth which no one ever miss'd</L>
<L>Tho' neither Sage nor Moralist:</L>
<L>Yet, all the Troubles notwithstanding,</L>
<L>Which Fate or Fortune has a Hand in,</L>
<L>Fools to themselves will more create,</L>
<L>In Spite of Fortune and of Fate.</L>
<L>Thus oft are dreaming Wretches seen,</L>
<L>Tortur'd with Vapours and with Spleen;</L>
<L>Transform'd (at least in their own Eyes,)</L>
<L>To Glass, or China, or Goose-Pies.</L>
<L>Others will to themselves appear</L>
<L>Stone-dead as <HI>Will the Conqueror</HI>;</L>
<L>And all the World in vain might strive,</L>
<L>To face them down, that they're alive.</L>
<L>Unlucky Males with Child will groan,</L>
<L>And sorely dread their lying down;</L>
<L>As fearing that, to ease their Pain,</L>
<L>May puzzle Doctor <HI>Chamberlaine</HI>.</L>
<L>Imaginary Evils slow</L>
<L>Merely for want of real Woe;</L>
<L>And when prevailing Whimsies rise,</L>
<L>As monstrous wild Absurdities</L>
<L>Are, ev'ry Hour, and ev'ry Minute,</L>
<L>Found without <HI>Bedlam</HI> as within it:</L>
<L>Which if you farther would have shewn,</L>
<L>And Leisure have to read, — read on.</L>
<L>There liv'd a Gentleman possess'd</L>
<L>Of all that Mortals reckon best:</L>
<L>A Seat well chose in wholsome Air,</L>
<L>With Gardens, and with Prospect fair:</L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="114"/>His Land from Debt and Jointure free;</L>
<L>His Money never in <HI>South-Sea:</HI></L>
<L>His Health of Body firm and good,</L>
<L>Tho' past the Heyday of his Blood;</L>
<L>His Consort fair, and good, and kind;</L>
<L>His Children rising to his Mind;</L>
<L>His Friends ingenious and sincere;</L>
<L>His Honour, nay, his Conscience clear:</L>
<L>He wanted nought of human Bliss,</L>
<L>But Power to taste his Happiness.</L>
<L>Too near, alas! this Great Man's Hall,</L>
<L>A merry Cobler had a Stall;</L>
<L>An arch old Wag as e'er you knew,</L>
<L>With Breeches red and Jerkin blue;</L>
<L>Chearful at working as at Play,</L>
<L>He sung and whistled Life away:</L>
<L>When rising Morning glads the Sky,</L>
<L>Clear as the merry Lark, and high;</L>
<L>When Ev'ning Shades the Landskip veil,</L>
<L>Late warbling as the Nightingale;</L>
<L>Tho' Pence came slow, and Trade was ill,</L>
<L>Yet still he sung, and whistled still;</L>
<L>Tho' patch'd his Garb, and coarse his Fare,</L>
<L>He laugh'd, and cast away old Care.</L>
<L>The rich Man view'd with Discontent,</L>
<L>His tatter'd Neighbour's Merriment,</L>
<L>With Envy grudg'd, and pin'd to see</L>
<L>A Beggar pleasanter than he;</L>
<L>And, by Degrees, to hate began</L>
<L>Th' intolerable happy Man,</L>
<L>Who haunted him like any Sprite,</L>
<L>From Morn to Eve, by Day and Night.</L>
<L>It chanc'd when once in Bed he lay,</L>
<L>When Dreams are true, at Break of Day,</L>
<L>He heard the Cobler at his Sport,</L>
<L>Amidst his Music stopping short:</L>
<L><PB N="111" REF="115"/>Whether his Morning Draught he took,</L>
<L>Or warming Whiff of wonted Smoak,</L>
<L>The 'Squire suspected, being shrewd,</L>

<L>And 'cause he nothing saw or heard,</L>
<L>A <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iavilian</HI> Plot he fear'd.</L>
<L>Strait Circumstances crowded plain</L>
<L>To vex and plague his jealous Brain:</L>
<L>Trembling in panic Dread he lies,</L>
<L>With gaping Mouth, and staring Eyes;</L>
<L>And straining wistful both his Ears,</L>
<L>He soon persuades himself he hears,</L>
<L>One skip and caper up the Stairs,</L>
<L>Sees the Door open quick, and knew,</L>
<L>His dreaded Foe in Red and Blue.</L>
<L>Who, with a running Jump, he thought,</L>
<L>Leapt plump directly down his Throat,</L>
<L>Laden with Tackle of his Stall,</L>
<L>Last, Ends, and Hammer, Strap, and Awl:</L>
<L>No sooner down, than with a Jerk,</L>
<L>He fell to Music, and to Work.</L>
<L>If much he griev'd our Don before,</L>
<L>When but o' th' outside of his Door,</L>
<L>How sorely must he now molest,</L>
<L>When got o' th'inside of his Breast;</L>
<L>The waking Dreamer groans and swells,</L>
<L>And Pangs imaginary feels;</L>
<L>Catches, and Scraps of Tunes he hears</L>
<L>For ever ringing in his Ears;</L>
<L>Ill-favour'd Smells his Nose displease,</L>
<L>Mundungus strong, and rotten Cheese;</L>
<L>He feels him when he draws his Breath,</L>
<L>Or tug the Leather with his Teeth;</L>
<L>Or beat the Sole, or else extend</L>
<L>His Arms to th' utmost of his End,</L>
<L>Enough to crack, when stretch'd so wide,</L>
<L>The Ribs of any mortal Side.</L>
<L><PB N="112" REF="116"/>Is there no Method, then, to fly</L>
<L>This vile intestine Enemy?</L>
<L>What can be done in this Condition,</L>
<L>But sending instant for Physician?</L>
<L>The Doctor, having heard the Case,</L>
<L>Burst into Laughter in his Face;</L>
<L>Told him, there needs no more than rise,</L>
<L>Open his Windows, and his Eyes,</L>
<L>Whistling and stitching there to see</L>
<L>The Cobler, as he us'd to be.</L>
<L>Sir, quoth the Patient, your Pretences</L>
<L>Shall ne'er persuade me from my Senses:</L>
<L>How should I rise? The heavy Brute</L>
<L>Will hardly let me wag a Foot:</L>
<L>Tho' Seeing for Belief must go,</L>
<L>Yet Feeling is the Truth, you know:</L>
<L>I feel him in my Sides, I tell ye,</L>
<L>Had you a Cobler in your Belly,</L>
<L>You scarce would fleer as now you do;</L>
<L>I doubt your Guts would grumble too.</L>
<L>Still do you laugh? I tell you, Sir,</L>
<L>I'd kick you soundly, could I stir:</L>
<L>Thou Quack, that never hadst Degree</L>
<L>In either University;</L>
<L>Thou mere Licenciate without Knowledge,</L>
<L>The Shame and Scandal of the College:</L>
<L>I'll call my Servants, if you stay;</L>
<L>So, Doctor, scamper while you may.</L>
<L>One thus dispatch'd, a second came,</L>
<L>Of equal Skill, and greater Fame;</L>
<L>Who swore him mad as a <HI>March</HI> Hare,</L>
<L>(For Doctors, when provok'd, will swear.)</L>
<L>To drive such Whimsies from his Pate,</L>
<L>He dragg'd him to the Window strait.</L>
<L>But jilting <HI>Fortune</HI> can devise</L>
<L>To baffle and outwit the Wise:</L>
<L><PB N="113" REF="117"/>The Cobler, ere expos'd to View,</L>
<L>Had just pull'd off his Jerkin blue,</L>
<L>Not dreaming 'twould his Neighbour hurt,</L>
<L>To fit <HI>in Fresco</HI> in his Shirt.</L>
<L>Ah! quoth the Patient, with a Sigh,</L>
<L>You know him not so well as I;</L>
<L>The Man who down my Throat is run,</L>
<L>Has got a true blue Jerkin on.</L>
<L>In vain the Doctor rav'd and tore,</L>

<L>Told him he might believe as well</L>
<L>The Giant of <HI>Pentagruel</HI></L>
<L>Did oft, as break his Fast or Sup,</L>
<L>For poach'd Eggs swallow Windmills up;</L>
<L>Or that the <HI>Holland</HI> Dame could bear</L>

<L>The vapour'd Dotard, grave and sly,</L>
<L>Mistook for Truth each rapping Lye;</L>
<L>And drew Conclusions such as these,</L>
<L>Resistless from the Premises.</L>
<L>I hope, my Friends, you'll grant me all,</L>
<L>A Windmill's bigger than a Stall;</L>
<L>And since the Lady brought alive</L>
<L>Children three Hundred sixty-five,</L>
<L>Why should you think there is not Room</L>

<L>Thus ev'ry Thing his Friends could say</L>
<L>The more confirm'd him in his Way:</L>
<L>Farther convinc'd, by what they tell,</L>
<L>'Twas certain, tho' impossible.</L>
<L>Now worse and worse the piteous State</L>
<L>Was grown, and almost desperate.</L>
<L>Yet still the utmost Bent to try,</L>
<L>Without more Help he would not die.</L>
<L>An old Physician, sly and shrewd,</L>
<L>With Management of Face endu'd,</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="118"/>Hear'd all his Tale; and ask'd, with Care,</L>
<L>How long the Cobler had been there?</L>
<L>Noted distinctly what he said;</L>
<L>Lift up his Eyes, and shook his Head,</L>
<L>And grave accosts him, on this Fashion,</L>
<L>After mature Deliberation,</L>
<L>With serious and important Face:</L>
<L>Sir, yours is an uncommon Case;</L>
<L>Tho' I've read <HI>Galen's</HI> Latin o'er,</L>
<L>I never met with it before;</L>
<L>Nor have I found the like Disease</L>
<L>In Stories of <HI>Hippocrates</HI>.</L>
<L>Then, after a convenient Stay,</L>
<L>Sir, if Prescription you'll obey,</L>
<L>My Life for yours, I'll set you free</L>
<L>From this same two-legg'd Timpany.</L>
<L>'Tis true you're gone beyond the Cure</L>
<L>Of fam'd Worm-Powder of <HI>John Moor</HI>;</L>
<L>Besides, if downwards he be sent,</L>
<L>I fear he'll split your nether Vent:</L>
<L>But then your Throat, you know, is wide,</L>
<L>And scarcely clos'd since it was try'd;</L>
<L>The same Way he got in, 'tis plain,</L>
<L>There's Room to fetch him out again:</L>
<L>I'll bring the forked Worm away</L>
<L>Without a <HI>Dysenteria:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Emetics</HI> strong will do the Feat,</L>
<L>If taken <HI>quantum sufficit:</HI></L>
<L>I'll see myself the proper Dose,</L>
<L>And then <HI>Hypnotics</HI> to compose.</L>
<L>The Wretch, tho' languishing and weak,</L>
<L>Reviv'd already by the <HI>Greek</HI>,</L>
<L>Cry'd, what so learn'd a Man as you</L>
<L>Prescribes, dear Doctor, I shall do.</L>
<L>The Vomit speedily was got,</L>
<L>The Cobler sent for to the Spot,</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="119"/>And taught to manage the Deceit,</L>
<L>And not his Doublet to forget.</L>
<L>But first the Operator wise,</L>
<L>Over his Sight a Bandage ties:</L>
<L>For Vomits always strain the Eyes.</L>
<L>Courage! I'll make you disembogue,</L>
<L>Spight of his Teeth, th' unlucky Rogue;</L>
<L>I'll drench the Rascal, never fear,</L>
<L>And bring him up, or drown him there.</L>
<L>Warm Water down he makes him pour,</L>
<L>Till his stretch'd Guts could hold no more;</L>
<L>Which doubly swoll'n, as you may think,</L>
<L>Both with the Cobler, and the Drink,</L>
<L>What they receiv'd against the Grain,</L>
<L>Soon paid with Int'rest back again.</L>
<L>Here come his Tools, he can't be long</L>
<L>Without his Hammer and his Thong.</L>
<L>The Cobler humour'd what was spoke,</L>
<L>And gravely carry'd on the Joke;</L>
<L>As he heard nam'd each single Matter,</L>
<L>He chuck'd it souse into the Water;</L>
<L>And then, not to be seen as yet,</L>
<L>Behind the Door made his Retreat.</L>
<L>The sick Man now takes Breath awhile,</L>
<L>Strength to recruit for farther Toil:</L>
<L>Unblinded he, with joyful Eyes,</L>

<L>Fully convinc'd within his Mind,</L>
<L>The Cobler could not stay behind,</L>
<L>Who to the Alehouse still would go,</L>
<L>When e'er he wanted Work to do:</L>
<L>Nor could he like his present Place,</L>
<L>He ne'er lov'd Water in his Days.</L>
<L>At length he takes a second Bout,</L>

<L>With Vehemence so sore he strains,</L>
<L>As would have split another's Brai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</L>
<L><PB N="116" REF="120"/>Ah! here the Cobler comes, I swear!</L>
<L>And Truth it was, for he was there,</L>
<L>And like a rude ill-manner'd Clown,</L>
<L>Kick'd with his Foot the Vomit down.</L>
<L>The Patient now grown wondrous light,</L>
<L>Whip'd off the Napkin from his Sight.</L>
<L>Briskly lifts up his Head and knew</L>
<L>The Breeches and the Jerkin's Hue;</L>
<L>And smil'd to hear him grumbling say,</L>
<L>As down the Stairs he ran his Way,</L>
<L>He'd ne'er set Foot within his Door,</L>
<L>And jump down open Throats no more;</L>
<L>No, while he liv'd, he'd ne'er again</L>
<L>Run, like a Fox, down the Red Lane.</L>
