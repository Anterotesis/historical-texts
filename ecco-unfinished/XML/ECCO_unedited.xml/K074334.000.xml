<HEAD>LETTERS
FROM
FRANCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I ARRIVED at Paris, by a very ra∣pid
journey, the day before the fede∣ration;
and when I am disposed to mur∣mur
at the evils of my destiny, I shall
henceforth put this piece of good fortune
into the opposite scale, and reflect how
many disappointments it ought to coun∣terbalance.
Had the packet which con∣veyed
me from Brighton to Dieppe sailed
a few hours later; had the wind been con∣trary;
in short, had I not reached Paris
at the moment I did reach it, I should
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
have missed the most sublime spectacle
which, perhaps, was ever represented on
the theatre of this earth.</P>
<P>I shall send you once a week the de∣tails
which I promised when we parted,
though I am well aware how very im∣perfectly
I shall be able to describe the
images which press upon my mind. It
is much easier to feel what is sublime than
to paint it; and all I shall be able to
give you will be a faint sketch, to which
your own imagination must add colour∣ing
and spirit. The night before the fe∣deration,
by way of prelude to the solem∣nities
of that memorable day, the Te
Deum was performed at the church of
Notre Dame, by a greater number of
musicians than have ever been assembled
together, excepting at Westminster Ab∣bey.
The overture which preceded the
Te Deum was simple and majestic: the
music, highly expressive, had the power
of electrifying the hearers: and near the
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
conclusion of the piece, the composer, by
artful discords, produced a melancholy
emotion, and then, by exciting ideas of
trouble and inquietude, prepared the mind
for a recitative which affected the audi∣ence
in a very powerful manner, by re∣calling
the images of that consternation
and horror which prevailed in Paris on
the 13th of July, 1789, the day before
that on which the Bastille was taken.
The words were, as well as I can recol∣lect,
what follows:—“People, your ene∣mies
advance, with hostile sentiments,
with menacing looks! They come to bathe
their hands in your blood! Already they
encompass the walls of your city! Rise,
rise from the inaction in which you are
plunged, seize your arms, and fly to the
combat! God will combat with you!”
These words were succeeded by a chorus
of instruments and voices, deep and so∣lemn,
which seemed to chill the soul. But
what completed the effect was, when the
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
sound of a loud and heavy bell mixed
itself with this awful concert, in imitation
of the alarm-bell, which, the day before
the taking of the Bastille, was rung in every
church and convent in Paris, and which,
it is said, produced a confusion of sounds
inexpressibly horrible. At this moment
the audience appeared to breathe with
difficulty; every heart seemed frozen with
terror; till at length the bell ceased, the
music changed its tone, and another re∣citative
announced the entire defeat of
the enemy; and the whole terminated,
after a flourish of drums and trumpets,
with an hymn of thanksgiving to the Su∣preme
Being.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>I Promised to send you a description of
the federation: but it is not to be de∣scribed!
One must have been present, to
form any judgment of a scene, the subli∣mity
of which depended much less on its
external magnificence than on the effect
it produced on the minds of the specta∣tors.
“The people, sure, the people
were the sight!” I may tell you of pa∣vilions,
of triumphal arches, of altars on
which incense was burnt, of two hundred
thousand men walking in procession; but
how am I to give you an adequate idea
of the behaviour of the spectators? How
am I to paint the impetuous feelings of
that immense, that exulting multitude?
Half a million of people assembled at a
spectacle, which furnished every image that
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
can elevate the mind of man; which con∣nected
the enthusiasm of moral sentiment
with the solemn pomp of religious cere∣monies;
which addressed itself at once to
the imagination, the understanding, and
the heart!</P>
<P>The Champ de Mars was formed into
an immense amphitheatre, round which
were erected forty rows of seats, raised
one above another with earth, on which
wooden forms were placed. Twenty days
labour, animated by the enthusiasm of the
people, accomplished what seemed to re∣quire
the toil of years. Already in the
Champ de Mars the distinctions of rank
were forgotten; and, inspired by the same
spirit, the highest and lowest orders of
citizens gloried in taking up the spade,
and assisting the persons employed in a
work on which the common welfare of
the state depended. Ladies took the in∣struments
of labour in their hands, and
removed a little of the earth, that they
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
might be able to boast that they also had
assisted in the preparations at the Champ
de Mars; and a number of old soldiers
were seen voluntarily bestowing on their
country the last remains of their strength.
A young Abbé of my acquaintance told
me, that the people beat a drum at the
door of the convent where he lived, and
obliged the Superior to let all the Monks
come out and work in the Champ de
Mars. The Superior with great reluct∣ance
acquiesced, “Quant à moi,” said
the young Abbé, “je ne demandois pas
mieux<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As for me, I desired nothing better.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>At the upper end of the amphitheatre
a pavilion was built for the reception of
the King, the Queen, their attendants,
and the National Assembly, covered with
striped tent-cloth of the national colours,
and decorated with streamers of the same
beloved tints, and fleur de lys. The
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
white flag was displayed above the spot
where the King was seated. In the mid∣dle
of the Champ de Mars L'Autel de la
Patrie was placed, on which incense was
burnt by priests dressed in long white
robes, with sashes of national ribbon.
Several inscriptions were written on the
altar, but the words visible at the greatest
distance were, La Nation, la Loi, et le
Roi<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Nation, the Law, and the King.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>At the lower end of the amphitheatre,
opposite to the pavilion, three triumphal
arches were erected, adorned with em∣blems
and allegorical figures.</P>
<P>The procession marched to the Champ
de Mars, through the central streets of
Paris. At La Place de Louis Quinze,
the escorts, who carried the colours, re∣ceived
under their banners, ranged in two
lines, the National Assembly, who came
from the Tuilleries. When the proces∣sion
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
passed the street where Henry the
Fourth was assassinated, every man paused
as if by general consent: the cries of joy
were suspended, and succeeded by a so∣lemn
silence. This tribute of regret,
paid from the sudden impulse of feeling
at such a moment, was perhaps the most
honourable testimony to the virtues of
that amiable Prince which his memory
has yet received.</P>
<P>In the streets, at the windows, and on
the roofs of the houses, the people, tran∣sported
with joy, shouted and wept as
the procession passed. Old men were
seen kneeling in the streets, blessing God
that they had lived to witness that happy
moment. The people ran to the doors
of their houses loaded with refreshments,
which they offered to the troops; and
crouds of women surrounded the soldiers,
and holding up their infants in their arms,
and melting into tears, promised to make
their children imbibe, from their earliest
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
age, an inviolable attachment to the prin∣ciples
of the new constitution.</P>
<P>The procession entered the Champ de
Mars by a long road, which thousands of
people had assisted in forming, by filling
up deep hollows, levelling the rising
grounds, and erecting a temporary bridge
across the Seine, opposite to the trium∣phal
arches. The order of the proces∣sion
was as follows:</P>
<P>A troop of horse, with trumpets.</P>
<P>A great band of music.</P>
<P>A detachment of grenadiers.</P>
<P>The electors chosen at Paris in 1789.</P>
<P>A band of volunteers.</P>
<P>The assembly of the representatives of
the people.</P>
<P>The military committee.</P>
<P>Company of chasseurs.</P>
<P>A band of drums.</P>
<P>The Presidents of sixty districts.</P>
<P>The Deputies of the people sent to the
Federation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="13"/>
The Administrators of the municipality.</P>
<P>Bands of music and drums.</P>
<P>Battalion of children, carrying a stand∣ard,
on which was written, L'Espe∣rance
de la Patrie<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hope of the Country.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Detachment with the colours of the
national guard of Paris.</P>
<P>Battalion of veterans.</P>
<P>Deputies from forty-two departments,
arranged alphabetically.</P>
<P>The Oriflamme, or grand standard of
the Kings of France.</P>
<P>Deputies from the regular troops.</P>
<P>Deputies from the navy.</P>
<P>Deputies from forty-one departments,
arranged also alphabetically.</P>
<P>Band of volunteer chasseurs.</P>
<P>Troop of horse, with trumpets.</P>
<P>The procession, which was formed with
eight persons abreast, entered the Champ
de Mars beneath the triumphal arches,
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
with a discharge of cannon. The de∣puties
placed themselves round the inside
of the amphitheatre. Between them and
the seats of the spectators, the national
guard of Paris were ranged; and the
seats round the amphitheatre were filled
with four hundred thousand people. The
middle of the amphitheatre was crouded
with an immense multitude of soldiers.
The National Assembly walked towards
the pavilion, where they placed themselves
with the King, the Queen, the royal fa∣mily,
and their attendants; and opposite
this group, rose in perspective the hills
of Passy and Chaillot, covered with peo∣ple.
The standards, of which one was
presented to each department of the king∣dom,
as a mark of brotherhood, by the
citizens of Paris, were carried to the
altar to be consecrated by the bishop.
High mass was performed, after which
Monsieur de la Fayette, who had been
appointed by the King Major General of
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
the Federation, ascended the altar, gave
the signal, and himself took the national
oath. In an instant every sword was
drawn, and every arm lifted up. The
King pronounced the oath, which the
President of the National Assembly re∣peated,
and the solemn words were re∣echoed
by six hundred thousand voices;
while the Queen raised the Dauphin in her
arms, shewing him to the people and the
army. At the moment the consecrated
banners were displayed, the sun, which
had been obscured by frequent showers in
the course of the morning, burst forth,
while the people lifted their eyes to hea∣ven,
and called upon the Deity to look
down and witness the sacred engagement
into which they entered. A respectful
silence was succeeded by the cries, the
shouts, the acclamations of the multitude:
they wept, they embraced each other,
and then dispersed.</P>
<P>You will not suspect that I was an in∣different
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
witness of such a scene. Oh no!
this was not a time in which the distinc∣tions
of country were remembered. It
was the triumph of human kind; it was
man asserting the noblest privileges of his
nature; and it required but the common
feelings of humanity to become in that
moment a citizen of the world. For my∣self,
I acknowledge that my heart caught
with enthusiasm the general sympathy; my
eyes were filled with tears; and I shall ne∣ver
forget the sensations of that day, “while
memory holds her seat in my bosom.”</P>
<P>The weather proved very unfavourable
during the morning of the federation;
but the minds of people were too much
elevated by ideas of moral good, to at∣tend
to the physical evils of the day. Se∣veral
heavy showers were far from inter∣rupting
the general gaiety. The people,
when drenched by the rain, called out
with exultation, rather than regret,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We are wet for the nation.</NOTE> “Nous
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
sommes mouillez a la nation.” Some
exclaimed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French revolution is cemented with water, instead of blood.</NOTE> “La revolution Françoise
est cimentée avec de l'eau, au lieu de
sang.” The national guard, during the
hours which preceded the arrival of the
procession, amused the spectators<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">With dancing in a circle.</NOTE> d'une
dance ronde, and with a thousand whim∣sical
and playful evolutions, highly expres∣sive
of that gaiety which distinguishes the
French character. I believe none but
Frenchmen would have diverted them∣selves,
and half a million of people, who
were waiting in expectation of a scene
the most solemn upon record, by circles
of ten thousand men galloping<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the round dance.</NOTE> en dance
ronde. But if you are disposed to think
of this gaiety with the contempt of supe∣rior
gravity, for I will not call it wisdom,
recollect that these dancers were the very
men whose bravery formed the great epo∣cha
of French liberty; the heroes who
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
demolished the towers of the Bastille, and
whose fame will descend to the latest pos∣terity.</P>
<P>Such was the admirable order with
which this august spectacle was conduct∣ed,
that no accident interrupted the uni∣versal
festivity. All carriages were for∣bidden
during that day, and the entrances
to the Champ de Mars were so nume∣rous,
that half a million of people were
collected together without a croud.</P>
<P>The people had only one subject of re∣gret:
they murmured that the king had
taken the national oath in the pavilion,
instead of performing that ceremony at
the foot of the altar; and some of them,
crouding round Mons. de la Fayette, con∣jured
him to persuade the king to go to
the altar, and take the oath a second
time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My friends, the oath is not an air which can be played twice over.</NOTE> “Mes enfans,” said Mons. de la
Fayette, “le serment n'est pas une ariette,
on ne peut pas le jouer deux fois.”</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Mons. de la Fayette, after the Federa∣tion,
went to the Chateau de la Muette,
where a public dinner was prepared for
the national guard. An immense croud
gathered round him when he alighted
from his horse, at a little distance from the
chateau, and some Aristocrates, mixing
themselves with the true worshippers of
him who is so justly the idol of the French
nation, attempted to stifle him with their
embraces. He called out “<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But, my friends, you stifle me.</NOTE> <HI>Mais, mes
amis, vous m'etouffez!</HI>” and one of his <HI>aide
de camps,</HI> who perceived the danger of his
general, threw himself from his horse,
which he intreated Mons. de la Fayette
to mount. He did so, and hastened to
the chateau.</P>
<P>This incident reminds me of a line in
Racine's fine tragedy of Britannicus, where
Nero says,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I embrace my rival, but it is to destroy him.</NOTE> “J'embrasse mon rival, mais c'est pour l'etouffer.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>THE rejoicings at Paris did not ter∣minate
with the ceremony of the Federa∣tion.
A succession of entertainments,
which lasted several days, were prepared
for the deputies from the provinces, who
were all quartered in the houses of the
bourgeois, where they were received with
the most cordial hospitality.</P>
<P>The night of the 14th of July the whole
city of Paris was illuminated, and the
next day le ci-devant Duc, now Mons.
d'Orleans, gave a public dinner to the na∣tional
guard in the hall of the Palais
Royal. We walked in the evening round
the gallery, from which we saw part of
the croud below amusing themselves by
dancing, while others were singing in
chorus the favourite national songs.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
On the following Sunday the national
guards were reviewed by Mons. de la
Fayette in the Champ de Mars, which
was again filled with spectators, and the
people appeared more enthusiastic than
ever in their applauses of their general.
The Champ de Mars resounded with re∣peated
cries of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live Mons. de la Fayette.</NOTE> “Vive Mons. de la Fay∣ette.”
On this day carriages were again
forbidden, and the evening displayed a
scene of general rejoicing. The whole
city was illuminated, and crouds of com∣pany
filled the gardens of the Tuilleries,
from which we saw the beautiful façade
of the Louvre lighted in the most splen∣did
manner. In the Champs Elysées,
where a fête was given to the Deputies,
innumerable lamps were hung from one
row of trees to another, and shed the most
agreeable brilliance on those enchanting
walks; where the exhilarated croud danced
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
and sung, and filled the air with the sound
of rejoicing. Several parties of the na∣tional
guard came from the Champ Ely∣sées,
dancing along the walks of the Tuil∣leries
with a woman between every two
men; and all the priests, whom they met
in their way, they obliged to join in the
dance, treating them as women, by placing
them between two soldiers, and some∣times
sportively dressing them in grena∣diers
caps. Fire-works of great variety
and beauty were exhibited on the Pont
Neuf, and the statue of Henry the Fourth
was decorated with the ornament of all
others the most dear in the eyes of the
people, a scarf of national ribbon. Trans∣parencies
of Mons. de la Fayette and
Mons. Bailly were placed, as the highest
mark of public favour, on each side of this
revered statue.</P>
<P>But the spectacle of all others the most
interesting to my feelings, was the re∣joicings
at the Bastille. The ruins of that
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
execrable fortress were suddenly trans∣formed,
as if with the wand of necro∣mancy,
into a scene of beauty and of plea∣sure.
The ground was covered with fresh
clods of grass, upon which young trees
were placed in rows, and illuminated with
a blaze of light. Here the minds of the
people took a higher tone of exultation
than in the other scenes of festivity. Their
mutual congratulations, their reflections
on the horror of the past, their sense of
present felicity, their cries of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live the Nation.</NOTE> “Vive la
Nation,” still ring in my ear! I too, though
but a sojourner in their land, rejoiced in
their happiness, joined the universal voice,
and repeated with all my heart and soul,
“Vive la nation!”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I suffered my friends at
Paris to conduct me through the usual
routine of convents, churches, and pala∣ces,
I requested to visit the Bastille; feel∣ing
a much stronger desire to contemplate
the ruins of that building than the most
perfect edifices of Paris. When we got
into the carriage, our French servant called
to the coachman, with an air of triumph,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the Bastille,—but we shall not remain there.</NOTE> “A la Bastille—mais nous n'y reste∣rons
pas.” We drove under that porch
which so many wretches have entered ne∣ver
to repass, and alighting from the car∣riage
descended with difficulty into the
dungeons, which were too low to admit
of our standing upright, and so dark that
we were obliged at noon-day to visit them
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
with the light of a candle. We saw the
hooks of those chains by which the pri∣soners
were fastened round the neck, to
the walls of their cells; many of which
being below the level of the water, are in
a constant state of humidity; and a nox∣ious
vapour issued from them, which
more than once extinguished the candle,
and was so insufferable that it required a
strong spirit of curiosity to tempt one to
enter. Good God!—and to these regions
of horror were human creatures dragged
at the caprice of despotic power. What
a melancholy consideration, that
<Q><L>—“Man! proud man,</L>
<L>Drest in a little brief authority,</L>
<L>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven,</L>
<L>As make the angels weep.”—</L></Q></P>
<P>There appears to be a greater number
of these dungeons than one could have
imagined the hard heart of tyranny itself
would contrive; for, since the destruction
of the building, many subterraneous cells
have been discovered underneath a piece
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
of ground which was inclosed within the
walls of the Bastille, but which seemed a
bank of solid earth before the horrid se∣crets
of this prison-house were disclosed.
Some skeletons were found in these re∣cesses,
with irons still fastened on their de∣caying
bones.</P>
<P>After having visited the Bastille, we
may indeed be surprized, that a nation so
enlightened as the French, submitted so
long to the oppressions of their govern∣ment;
but we must cease to wonder that
their indignant spirits at length shook off
the galling yoke.</P>
<P>Those who have contemplated the dun∣geons
of the Bastille, without rejoicing in
the French revolution, may, for aught I
know, be very respectable persons, and
very agreeable companions in the hours
of prosperity; but, if my heart were sink∣ing
with anguish, I should not fly to those
persons for consolation. Sterne says, that
a man is incapable of loving one woman
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
as he ought, who has not a sort of an af∣fection
for the whole sex; and as little
should I look for particular sympathy
from those who have no feelings of gene∣ral
philanthropy. If the splendour of a
despotic throne can only shine like the ra∣diance
of lightning, while all around is
involved in gloom and horror, in the name
of heaven let its baleful lustre be extin∣guished
for ever. May no such strong
contrast of light and shade again exist in
the political system of France! but may
the beams of liberty, like the beams of
day, shed their benign influence on the
cottage of the peasant, as well as on the
palace of the monarch! May liberty,
which for so many ages past has taken
pleasure in softening the evils of the bleak
and rugged climates of the north, in fer∣tilizing
a barren soil, in clearing the
swamp, in lifting mounds against the inun∣dations
of the tempest, diffuse her bles∣sings
also on the genial land of France,
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
and bid the husbandman rejoice under the
shade of the olive and the vine!</P>
<P>The Bastille, which Henry the Fourth
and his veteran troops assailed in vain, the
citizens of Paris had the glory of taking
in a few hours. The avarice of Mons.
de Launay had tempted him to guard
this fortress with only half the comple∣ment
of men ordered by government;
and a letter which he received the morn∣ing
of the 14th of July, commanding him
to sustain the siege till the evening, when
succour would arrive, joined to his own
treachery towards the assailants, cost him
his life.</P>
<P>The courage of the besiegers was in∣flamed
by the horrors of famine, there
being at this time only twenty-four hours
provision of bread in Paris. For some
days the people had assembled in crouds
round the shops of the bakers, who were
obliged to have a guard of soldiers to
protect them from the famished multi∣tude;
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
while the women, rendered furious
by want, cried, in the resolute tone of de∣spair,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We must have bread for our children.</NOTE> “Il nous faut du pain pour nos
enfans.” Such was the scarcity of bread,
that a French gentleman told me, that,
the day preceding the taking of the Bas∣tille,
he was invited to dine with a Nego∣tiant,
and, when he went, was informed
that a servant had been out five hours in
search of bread, and had at last been able
to purchase only one loaf.</P>
<P>It was at this crisis, it was to save them∣selves
the shocking spectacle of their
wives and infants perishing before their
eyes, that the citizens of Paris flew to
arms, and, impelled by such causes, fought
with the daring intrepidity of men who
had all that renders life of any value at
stake, and who determined to die or con∣quer.
The women too, far from indulg∣ing
the fears incident to our feeble sex, in
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
defiance of the cannon of the Bastille, ven∣tured
to bring victuals to their sons and
husbands; and, with a spirit worthy of Ro∣man
matrons, encouraged them to go
on. Women mounted guard in the
streets, and, when any person passed, called
out boldly,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Who goes there?</NOTE> “Qui va la?”</P>
<P>A gentleman, who had the command
of fifty men in this enterprize, told me,
that one of his soldiers being killed by a
cannon-ball, the people, with great marks
of indignation, removed the corpse, and
then, snatching up the dead man's hat,
begged money of the bystanders for his
interment, in a manner characteristic
enough of that gaiety, which never for∣sakes
the French, even on such occasions
as would make any other people on earth
serious.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Madam, for this poor devil, who has been killed for the Nation!—Sir, for this unfortunate dog, who has been killed for the Nation!</NOTE> “Madame, pour ce pauvre
diable qui ce fait tué pour la Nation!

—Mons. pour ce pauvre chien qui se fait
tué pour la nation!” This mode of
supplication, though not very pathetic,
obtained the end desired; no person be∣ing
sufficiently obdurate to resist the pow∣erful
plea,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had been killed for the Nation.</NOTE> “qu'il se fait tué pour la
Nation.”</P>
<P>When the Bastille was taken, and the
old man, of whom you have no doubt
heard, and who had been confined in a
dungeon thirty-five years, was brought
into day-light, which had not for so long
a space of time visited his eyes, he stag∣gered,
shook his white beard, and cried
faintly,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gentlemen, you have rendered me one great service; render me another, kill me! for I know not where to go.—Come along, come along, the Nation will provide for you.</NOTE> “Messieurs, vous m'avez rendu
un grand service, rendez m'en un autre,
tuez moi! je ne sais pas où aller.”—“Al∣lons,
allons,” the croud answered with
one voice, “la Nation te nourrira.”</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
As the heroes of the Bastille passed
along the streets after its surrender, the
citizens stood at the doors of their houses
loaded with wine, brandy, and other re∣freshments,
which they offered to these
deliverers of their country. But they
unanimously refused to taste any strong
liquors, considering the great work they
had undertaken as not yet accomplished,
and being determined to watch the whole
night, in case of any surprize.</P>
<P>All those who had assisted in taking the
Bastille, were presented by the municipa∣lity
of Paris with a ribbon of the national
colours, on which is stamped, inclosed in
a circle of brass, an impression of the
Bastille, and which is worn as a military
order.</P>
<P>The municipality of Paris also pro∣posed
a solemn funeral procession in me∣mory
of those who lost their lives in this
enterprize; but, on making application to
the National Assembly for a deputation
<PB N="31" REF="33" MS="y"/>
of its members to assist at this solemnity,
the assembly were of opinion that these
funeral honours should be postponed till a
more favourable moment, as they might
at present have a tendency to inflame the
minds of the people.</P>
<P>I have heard several persons mention a
young man, of a little insignificant figure,
who, the day before the Bastille was taken,
got up on a chair in the Palais Royal, and
harangued the multitude, conjuring them
to make a struggle for their liberty, and
asserting, that now the moment was ar∣rived.
They listened to his eloquence
with the most eager attention; and, when
he had instructed as many as could hear
him at one time, he requested them to
depart, and repeated his harangue to a
new set of auditors.</P>
<P>Among the dungeons of the Bastille
are placed, upon a heap of stones, the fi∣gures
of the two men who contrived the
plan of this fortress, where they were after∣wards
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
confined for life. These men are
represented chained to the wall, and are
beheld without any emotion of sympa∣thy.</P>
<P>The person employed to remove the
ruins of the Bastille, has framed of the
stones eighty-three complete models of
this building, which, with a true patri∣otic
spirit, he has presented to the eighty-three
departments of the kingdom, by
way of hint to his countrymen to take
care of their liberties in future.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V.</HEAD>
<P>I Am just returned from a visit to Ma∣dame
Sillery, whose works on education
are so well known and so justly esteemed
in England, and who received me with
the most engaging politeness. Surely
the French are unrivalled in the arts of
pleasing; in the power of uniting with
the most polished elegance of manners,
that attentive kindness which seems to
flow warm from the heart, and which,
while it sooths our vanity, secures our
affections. Madame Sillery and her pu∣pils
are at present at St. Leu, a beau∣tiful
spot in the rich valley of Mont∣morenci.
Mons. d'Orleans has cer∣tainly
conferred a most essential obliga∣tion
upon his children, by placing them
under the care of this lady. I never met
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
with young people more amiable in their
dispositions, or more charming in their
manners, which are equally remote from
arrogance, and from those efforts of con∣descension
which I have seen some great
people make, with much difficulty to
themselves, and much offence to others.
The Princess, who is thirteen years of
age, has a countenance of the sweetest
expression, and appears to me to be Ade∣laide,
the heroine of Madame Sillery's
Letters on Education, personified. The
three princes, though under Madame Sil∣lery's
superintendence, have also precep∣tors
who live in the house, and assist in
their education. The eldest prince, Mons.
de Chartres, is nearly eighteen years of
age, and his attentive politeness formed a
striking contrast in my mind, to the man∣ners
of those fashionable gentlemen in a
certain great metropolis, who consider
apathy and negligence as the test of good∣breeding.
But if I was pleased with the
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
manners of this young Prince, I was still
more delighted to find him a confirmed
friend to the new constitution of France,
and willing, with the enthusiasm of a young
and ardent mind, to renounce the splen∣dour
of his titles for the general good.
When he heard that the sacrifice of
fortune also was required, and that the
immense property, which he had been
taught to consider as his inheritance, was
to be divided with his brothers, he em∣braced
them with the utmost affection,
declaring that he should rejoice in such a
division. To find a democratic Prince,
was somewhat singular: I was much less
surprized that Madame Sillery had adopt∣ed
sentiments which are so congenial to
an enlarged and comprehensive mind.
This lady I have called Sillery, because it
is the name by which she is known in
England; but, since the decree of the Na∣tional
Assembly, abolishing the nobility,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
she has renounced with her title the name
of Sillery, and has taken that of Brulart.</P>
<P>She talked to me of the distinctions of
rank, in the spirit of philosophy, and ri∣diculed
the absurdity of converting the
rewards of personal merit into the inhe∣ritance
of those who had perhaps so little
claim to honours, that they were a sort of
oblique reproach on their character and
conduct. There may be arguments
against hereditary rank sufficiently con∣vincing
to such an understanding as Ma∣dame
Brulart's: but I know some French
ladies who entertain very different notions
on this subject; who see no impropriety
in the establishments of nobility; and
who have carried their love of aristocra∣tical
rights so far as to keep their beds, in
a fit of despondency, upon being obliged
to relinquish the agreeable epithets of
Comtesse or Marquise, to which their ears
had been so long accustomed.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="39"/>
But let me do justice to the ladies of
France. The number of those who have
murmured at the loss of rank, bears a very
small proportion to those who have acted
with a spirit of distinguished patriotism;
who, with those generous affections which
belong to the female heart, have gloried in
sacrificing titles, fortune, and even the per∣sonal
ornaments, so dear to female vanity,
for the common cause. It was the ladies
who gave the example of le don patrio∣tique
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patriotic donation.</NOTE>, by offering their jewels at the
shrine of liberty; and, if the women of
ancient Rome have gained the applause of
distant ages for such actions, the women
of France will also claim the admiration
of posterity.</P>
<P>The women have certainly had a con∣siderable
share in the French revolution:
for, whatever the imperious lords of the
creation may fancy, the most important
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
events which take place in this world de∣pend
a little on our influence; and we
often act in human affairs like those secret
springs in mechanism, by which, though
invisible, great movements are regulated.</P>
<P>But let us return to Madame Brulart,
who wears at her breast a medallion made
of a stone of the Bastille polished. In
the middle of the medallion, <HI>Liberté</HI> was
written in diamonds; above was marked,
in diamonds, the planet that shone on the
14th of July; and below was seen the
moon, of the size she appeared that me∣morable
night. The medallion was set
in a branch of laurel, composed of eme∣ralds,
and tied at the top with the national
cockade, formed of brilliant stones of the
three national colours.</P>
<P>Our conversation on the subject of the
Bastille, led Madame Brulart to relate an
action of Mons. de Chartres, which re∣flects
the highest honour on his humanity.
Being in Normandy, he visited Mont St.
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
Michel, a fortress built on a rock which
stands a league and a half from the coast
of Normandy. The tide covers this space
twice every twenty-four hours; but when
it is low-water, a person can pass over on
foot. Mont St. Michel was originally a
church, founded by a good bishop in the
seventh century, in honour of St. Michel,
who, it seems, appeared to him in a vision
on this spot. Richard, the first Duke of
Normandy of that name, afterwards con∣verted
the church into an abbey, and this
abbey gave rise to the military order des
Chevaliers de St. Michel, instituted by
Louis the Eleventh. After having seen the
precious relics of the abbey, the square
buckler, and the short sword found in
Ireland near the body of the well-known
dragon, whose destruction is attributed to
the prowess of St. Michel, Mons. de Char∣tres
was conducted, through many laby∣rinths,
to the subterraneous parts of the
edifice; where he was shewn a wooden
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
cage, which was made by order of Louis
the Fourteenth, for the punishment of an
unfortunate wit, who had dared to ridi∣cule
his conquests in Holland, no sooner
gained than lost. Mons. de Chartres
beheld with horror this instrument of
tyranny, in which prisoners were still
frequently confined; and, expressing in
very strong terms his indignation, he was
told, that, as a prince of the blood, he
had a right, if he thought proper, to
order the cage to be destroyed. Scarcely
were the words pronounced, when the
young Prince seized a hatchet, gave the
first stroke himself to this execrable ma∣chine,
waited to see it levelled with the
ground, and thus may claim the glory or
having, even before the demolition of the
Bastille, begun the French revolution.</P>
<P>We found at St. Leu a young English
lady, who is the companion of the Prin∣cess,
and whose appearance is calculated
to give the most favourable idea of Eng∣lish
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
beauty. I never saw more regular
features, or an expression of countenance
more lovely: and Madame Brulart, by
whom she has been educated, assured me
that “the mind keeps the promise we
had from the face.” This young lady
talked of her own country with a glow of
satisfaction very grateful to my feelings.
She seems to,
<Q><L>“Cast a look where England's glories shine,</L>
<L>And bids her bosom sympathise with mine.”</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<P>I Have been at the National Assembly,
where, at a time when the deputies from
the provinces engrossed every ticket of
admission, my sister and I were admitted
without tickets, by the gentleman who
had the command of the guard, and placed
in the best seats, before he suffered the
doors to be opened to other people. We
had no personal acquaintance with this
gentleman, or any claim to his politeness,
except that of being foreigners and wo∣men;
but these are, of all claims, the
most powerful to the urbanity of French
manners.</P>
<P>My sister observed to me, that our seats,
which were immediately opposite the tri∣bune
from which the members speak, re∣minded
her of our struggles to attain the
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
same situation in Westminster Hall. But
you must recollect, I answered, that we
have attained this situation without any
struggle. I believe, however, that if the
fame of Mr. Fox's eloquence should lead
a French woman to present herself at the
door of Westminster Hall without a tic∣ket,
she might stand there as long as Mr.
Hastings's trial has lasted, without being
permitted to pass the barrier.</P>
<P>The hall of the National Assembly is
long and narrow; at each end there is a
gallery, where the common people are
admitted by applying very early in the
morning for numbers, which are distri∣buted
at the door; and the persons
who first apply secure the first numbers.
The seats being also numbered, all con∣fusion
and disorder are prevented. The
galleries at the side of the hall are di∣vided
into boxes, which are called tri∣bunes.
They belong to the principal
members of the National Assembly, and
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
to these places company are admitted
with tickets. Rows of seats are placed
round the hall, raised one above another,
where the members of the Assembly are
seated; and immediately opposite the chair
of the president, in the narrow part of
the hall, is the tribune which the mem∣bers
ascend when they are going to speak.
One capital subject of debate in this As∣sembly
is, who shall speak first; for all
seem more inclined to talk than to listen;
and sometimes the president in vain rings
a bell, or with the vehemence of French
action stretches out his arms, and endea∣vours
to impose silence; while the six
Huissers, persons who are appointed to
keep order, make the attempt with as
little success as the president himself. But
one ceases to wonder that the meetings of
the National Assembly are tumultuous,
on reflecting how important are the ob∣jects
of its deliberations. Not only the
lives and fortunes of individuals, but the
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
existence of the country is at stake: and
of how little consequence is this impe∣tuosity
in debate, if the decrees which are
passed are wise and beneficial, and the new
constitution arises, like the beauty and
order of nature, from the confusion of
mingled elements! I heard several of
the members speak; but I am so little
qualified to judge of oratory, that, with∣out
presuming to determine whether I
had reason to be entertained or not, I
shall only tell you that I was so.</P>
<P>And this, repeated I with exultation to
myself, this is the National Assembly of
France! Those men now before my eyes
are the men who engross the attention, the
astonishment of Europe; for the issue of
whose decrees surrounding nations wait in
suspence, and whose fame has already ex∣tended
through every civilized region of
the globe: the men whose magnanimity
invested them with power to destroy the
old constitution, and whose wisdom is
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
erecting the new, on a principle of perfec∣tion
which has hitherto been thought chi∣merical,
and has only served to adorn the
page of the philosopher; but which they
believe may be reduced to practice, and
have therefore the courage to attempt.
My mind, with a sensation of elevated plea∣sure,
passing through the interval of ages,
anticipated the increasing renown of these
legislators, and the period when, all the
nations of Europe following the liberal
system which France has adopted, the
little crooked policy of the present times
shall give place to the reign of reason,
virtue, and science.</P>
<P>The most celebrated characters in the
National Assembly were pointed out to
us. Monsieur Barnave de Dauphine,
who is only six and twenty years of age,
and the youngest member of the Assem∣bly,
is esteemed its first orator, and is the
leader of the democratic party. I believe
Mons. Barnave does not owe all his re∣putation
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
to his talents, however distin∣guished:
his virtues also claim a consider∣able
share of that applause which he re∣ceives
from his country. He has shewn
himself as stedfast in principle, as he is
eloquent in debate. With firm undevi∣ating
integrity he has defended the cause
of the people. Every motion he has
made in the Assembly has passed into a
law, because its beneficial tendency has
been always evident; and it was he who
effected that memorable decree which
deprived the King of the power of mak∣ing
war, without the consent of the na∣tion.
Mons. Barnave is adored by the
people; who have two or three times ta∣ken
the horses from his carriage, and
drawn him in triumph along the streets
of Paris.</P>
<P>We also saw Mons. Mirabeau l'ainé,
whose genius is of the first class, but who
possesses a very small share of popularity.
I am, however, one of his partizans,
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
though not merely from that enthusiasm
which always comes across my heart in
favour of great intellectual abilities. Mons.
Mirabeau has another very powerful claim
on my partiality: he is the professed friend
(and I must and will love him for being
so) of the African race. He has pro∣posed
the abolition of the slave trade to
the National Assembly, and, though the
Assembly have delayed the consideration
of this subject, on account of those deli∣berations
which immediately affect the
country, yet, perhaps, if our senators con∣tinue
to doze over this affair as they have
hitherto done, the French will have the
glory of setting us an example, which it
will then be our humble employment to
follow. But I trust the period will never
come, when England will submit to be
taught by another nation the lesson of hu∣manity.
I trust an English House of
Commons will never persist in thinking,
that what is morally wrong, can be poli∣tically
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
right; that the virtue and the pros∣perity
of a people are things at variance
with each other; and that a country which
abounds with so many sources of wealth,
cannot afford to close one polluted chan∣nel,
which is stained with the blood of
our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>But it is a sort of treason to the honour,
the spirit, the generosity of Englishmen,
to suppose they will persevere in such
conduct. Admitting, however, a suppo∣sition
which it is painful to make; admit∣ting
that they should abide by this system
of inhumanity, they will only retard, but
will not finally prevent the abolition of
slavery. The Africans have not long to
suffer, nor their oppressors to triumph.
Europe is hastening towards a period too
enlightened for the perpetuation of such
monstrous abuses. The mists of igno∣rance
and error are rolling fast away, and
the benign beams of philosophy are spread∣ing
their lustre over the nations.—But
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
whither have these children of captivity
led me? I perceive I have wandered a
great way from the National Assembly,
where I was so happily seated, and of
which I will tell you more in my next
letter.</P>

<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="letter">
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Abbé Maury is one of the most
distinguished members of the National
Assembly. He possesses astonishing pow∣ers
of eloquence; but he has done his
talents the injustice to make them sub∣servient
to the narrow considerations of
self-interest. Had he displayed that abi∣lity
in defence of civil and religious li∣berty,
which he has employed in the ser∣vice
of the exorbitant pretensions of the
church, he would have deserved the high∣est
applause of his country; instead of
which, he has called to the aid of his ge∣nius
an auxiliary it ought to have scorned;
that subtlety which tries “to make the
worse appear the better reason;” and he
is still more detested than admired. I am
not surprized that a little mind is some∣times
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
tempted by interest to tread in a
mean and sordid path; but I own it does
astonish me that genius can be seduced
from the fair field of honourable fame
into those serpentine ways where it can
meet with no object worthy of its ambi∣tion.
“Something too much of this.”
You shall hear a repartee of the Abbé
Maury, who, after having made a very
unpopular motion in the Assembly, was
insulted as he was going out; the people
crying, as they are too apt to do,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the lantern.</NOTE> “A la
lanterne.” The Abbé, turning to the
croud, answered, with equal indignation
and spirit,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If I were at the lantern, would you be more enlightened?</NOTE> “Eh! Messieurs, si j'etois à
la lanterne, serez vous plus eclairér?”
The Abbé Maury, before the revolution,
was in possession of eight hundred farms,
and has lost sixty thousand livres a year
in consequence of that event. But enough
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
of Mons. l'Abbé, whose picture I have
just purchased in a snuff-box. You touch
a spring, open the lid of the snuff-box,
and the Abbé jumps up, and occasions
much surprize and merriment. The joke,
however, is grown a little stale in France:
but I shall bring the Abbé with me to
England, where I flatter myself his sudden
appearance will afford some diversion.</P>
<P>A singular but very respectable figure
in the National Assembly is a Deputy
from Britany, called Le Pere Gerard.
This venerable old man is a peasant, and
his appearance reminds one of those times
when Generals were called from the
plough to take the command of armies.
The dress of Le Pere Gerard is made of
a coarse woollen cloth, which is worn by
the peasants of Britany, and is of such
strong texture that a coat often descends
from one generation to another. This
cloth is called Pinchina; and the King, to
whom the old Breton has presented several
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
addresses from the Assembly, calls him,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In pleasantry, Father Pinchina.</NOTE> en badinage, Le Pere Pinchina. When
I saw him, he had on this everlasting coat,
and wore worsted stockings gartered
above the knees. But, what pleased me
most in his appearance, were the long
white hairs which hung down his shoul∣ders;
an ornament for which you know I
have a particular predilection.</P>
<P>The respectable Pere Gerard boasts
that he is descended from a race of depu∣ties,
his great grandfather having been
chosen as a deputy to Les Etats Gene∣raux
in 1614, the last time the States were
held, before that memorable period when
they effected the revolution.</P>
<P>At the time when the ladies set the ex∣ample
of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The patriotic donation.</NOTE> Le don patrioque▪ by offering
their jewels, and the members of the Na∣tional
Assembly, in a moment of enthu∣siasm,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
took the silver buckles out of their
shoes, and laid them on the President's
table, the Pere Gerard rose, and said, that
he had no such offering to give, his buckles
being made of brass, but that his don pa∣triotique
should be that of rendering his
services to his country unpaid. The old
man was heard by the Assembly with the
applause he merited; and the people, on
the day of the Federation, carried him
from the Champ de Mars to his own
house in triumph on their shoulders.</P>
<P>Messieurs Charles and Alexander La∣meth,
two brothers, and Mons. Rabeau
de St. Estienne, are among the first pa∣triots
of the National Assembly, and have
a very high reputation for talents. The
French, who love what they call an
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A play upon words.</NOTE> equivoque, tell you, que Mons. Rabeau
vaut deux d'Mirabeau.</P>
<P>The meetings of the Assembly, though
still tumultuous, are much less so than
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
they were at their first commencement.
A gentleman, who was present when the
motion was made for abolishing monaste∣ries,
told me, that the minds of the mem∣bers
were, on that occasion, inflamed to
such a height, that it appeared to him
very probable, that the debate would end
in a massacre. He mentioned a circum∣stance
very characteristic of French viva∣city.
One of the members was expressing
himself in these words, “What is a Monk?
A man who has renounced his father, his
mother, every tie, every affection that is
dear in nature! and for whom?”—before
the speaker could finish his sentence, a
member from the other end of the hall
seized the moment while the orator was
drawing his breath, and called out<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a foreign power.</NOTE> “Pour
une puissance etrangere,” to the great
horror of la coté noir, for so the clergy are
called.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
The Democrates place themselves on
one side of the hall, and the Aristocrates
on the other. The spectators in the gal∣leries
take such a part in the debate, as
frequently to express their applause by
clapping their hands with great violence.
An old Marechal of France rose, the day
I was at the Assembly, when they were
debating on the military pensions, and de∣clared,
that in recompense for the services
which he had rendered his country, he
desired honours and not pay. The As∣sembly
clapped him, and the galleries
joined in this mark of approbation. A
young Frenchman, who sat next me,
whispered to me,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I suppose that gentleman finds money trou∣blesome.</NOTE> “Mons. trouve appa∣ramment
que l'argent l'incommode.”</P>
<P>The members of the National Assem∣bly
are paid three crowns a day for their
attendance; while in England a candi∣date
for a seat in parliament often spends
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
many thousand pounds, and, with magni∣ficent
generosity, makes a whole county
drunk for a week, merely to enjoy the
privilege of serving his country without
pay.</P>
<P>The qualification requisite for a mem∣ber
of the National Assembly, is that of
possessing sufficient property in land or
houses to pay taxes to the amount of a
marc d'argent, which is the value of four
louis. Every hundred of the citizens, who
pay taxes to government of three days
labour, or three livres, have a right to
vote for an elector; whose qualification is
that of paying taxes to the amount of ten
livres, or ten days labour. The electors
of one department meet together in one
assembly, and chuse from among their
own body the persons who are to direct
the administration of that department.
Those electors will also chuse in the same
manner the deputies sent by that depart∣ment
to the National Assembly. There
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
will therefore be only one intermediate
degree between the lowest order of active
citizens, and the members of the National
Assembly.</P>
<P>I was interrupted by a visitor, who re∣lated
a little incident, which has interested
me so much, that I can write of nothing
else at present, and you shall therefore
have it warm from my heart. While the
National Assembly were deliberating upon
the division of property among brothers,
a young man of high birth and fortune,
who is a member of the Assembly, entered
with precipitation, and, mounting the tri∣bune,
with great emotion informed the
Assembly, that he had just received ac∣counts
that his father was dying; that he
himself was his eldest son, and had come
to conjure the Assembly to pass, without
delay, that equitable decree, giving the
younger sons an equal share of fortune
with the eldest, in order, he said, that his
father might have the satisfaction, before
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
he breathed his last, of knowing that all
his children were secure of a provision.
If you are not affected by this circum∣stance,
you have read it with very differ∣ent
feelings from those with which I have

<P>YOU have not heard, perhaps, that
on the day of the Federation at Paris, the
national oath was taken throughout the
whole kingdom, at the hour of twelve.</P>
<P>A great number of farmers and pea∣sants
walked in the procession at Rouen,
bearing in their hands the instruments of
their husbandry, decorated with national
ribbons. The national guard cut down
branches from the trees, and stuck them
in their hats; and a French gentleman of
my acquaintance, who understands Eng∣lish,
and reads Shakespeare, told me, that
it seemed like Birnham Wood coming to
Dunsinane.</P>
<P>The leaders of the French revolution,
are men well acquainted with the human
heart. They have not trusted merely to
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
the force of reason, but have studied to
interest in their cause the most powerful
passions of human nature, by the ap∣pointment
of solemnities perfectly calcu∣lated
to awaken that general sympathy
which is caught from heart to heart with
irresistible energy, fills every eye with
tears, and thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bs in every bosom.</P>
<P>I have heard of a procession, which took
place not long ago in one of the districts
of Paris, in which five hundred young
ladies walked dressed in white, and deco∣rated
with cockades of the national rib∣bon,
leading by silken cords a number of
prisoners newly released from captivity;
and who, with their faces covered by long
flowing veils, were conducted to a church,
where they returned thanks for their deli∣verance.</P>
<P>Thus have the leaders of the revolution
engaged beauty as one of their auxiliaries,
justly concluding, that, to the gallantry and
sensibility of Frenchmen, no argument
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
would be found more efficacious than that
of a pretty face.</P>
<P>I have just read a private letter from
a little town about two leagues from Mont∣auban,
called Negre-Pelisse, where the
inhabitants, on the day of the Federation,
displayed a liberality of sentiment, which
reflects honour, not only on themselves,
but on the age in which we live. The
national guard of this little town and its
environs, were assembled to take the na∣tional
oath. Half of the inhabitants be∣ing
Protestants, and the other half Catho∣lics,
the Curé and the Protestant Minister
ascended together one altar, which had
been erected by the citizens, and admi∣nistered
the oath to their respective pa∣rishioners
at the same moment, after
which, Catholics and Protestants joined
in singing Te Deum.</P>
<P>Surely religious worship was never per∣formed
more truly in the spirit of the Di∣vine
author of Christianity, whose great
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
precept is that of universal love! Surely
the incense of praise was never more likely
to ascend to heaven, than when the Ca∣tholics
and Protestants of Negre-Pelisse
offered it together!</P>
<P>This amiable community, when their
devotions were finished, walked in pro∣cession
to a spot where fire-works had
been prepared; and, it being considered
as a mark of honour to light the fire∣works,
the office was reserved for Mons.
le Curé, who, however, insisted on the
participation of the Protestant Minister in
this distinction; upon which the Minister
received a wax taper from the Curé, and
with him led the procession. The fire∣works
represented two trees. One, twist∣ed
and distorted, was emblematical of
aristocracy, and was soon entirely con∣sumed;
when a tall straight plant, figura∣tive
of patriotism, appeared to rise from
the ashes of the former, and continued to
burn with undiminished splendour.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67"/>
When we look back on the ignorance,
the superstition, the barbarous persecu∣tions
of Gothic times, is it not something
to be thankful for, that we exist at this
enlightened period, when such evils are
no more; when particular tenets of reli∣gious
belief are no longer imputed as
crimes; when the human mind has made
as many important discoveries in morality
as in science, and liberality of sentiment
is cultivated with as much success as arts
and learning; when, in short, (and <HI>you</HI>
are not one of those who will suspect that
I am not all the while a good English-woman)
when one can witness an event
so sublime as the French revolution?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>YESTERDAY I received your let∣ter,
in which you accuse me of describ∣ing
with too much enthusiasm the public
rejoicings in France, and prophesy that
I shall return to my own country a fierce
republican. In answer to these accusa∣tions,
I shall only observe, that it is very
difficult, with common sensibility, to avoid
sympathizing in general happiness. My
love of the French revolution, is the na∣tural
result of this sympathy, and there∣fore
my political creed is entirely an af∣fair
of the heart; for I have not been so
absurd as to consult my head upon mat∣ters
of which it is so incapable of judging.
If I were at Rome, you would not be sur∣prized
to hear that I had visited, with the
warmest reverence, every spot where any
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
relics of her ancient grandeur could be
traced; that I had flown to the capitol,
that I had kissed the earth on which the
Roman senate sat in council: And can you
then expect me to have seen the Federa∣tion
at the Champ de Mars, and the Na∣tional
Assembly of France, with indiffe∣rence?
Before you insist that I ought to
have done so, point out to me, in the
page of Roman history, a spectacle more
solemn, more affecting, than the Champ
de Mars exhibited, or more magnani∣mous,
more noble efforts in the cause of
liberty than have been made by the Na∣tional
Assembly. Whether the new form
of government, establishing in France, be
more or less perfect than our own,
<Q><L>“Who shall decide, when doctors disagree,</L>
<L>And soundest casuists doubt, like you and me?”</L></Q>
I fancy we had better leave the determi∣nation
of this question in the hands of
posterity. In the mean time, I wish that
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
some of our political critics would speak
with less contempt, than they are apt to do,
of the new constitution of France, and
no longer repeat after one another the trite
remark, that the French have gone too
far, because they have gone farther than
ourselves; as if it were not possible that
that degree of influence which is perfectly
safe in the hand of the executive part of
our government, might be dangerous, at
this crisis, to the liberty of France. But
be this as it may, it appears evident that
the temple of Freedom which they are
erecting, even if imperfect in some of its
proportions, must be preferable to the
old gloomy Gothic fabric which they have
laid in ruins. And therefore, when I hear
my good countrymen, who guard their
own rights with such unremitting vigi∣lance,
and who would rather part with
life than liberty, speak with contempt of
the French for having imbibed the noble
lesson which England has taught, I cannot
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
but suspect that some mean jealousy lurks
beneath the ungenerous censure. I can∣not
but suspect, that, while the fair and
honourable traders of our commercial
country act with the most liberal spirit in
their ordinary dealings with other nations,
they wish to make a monopoly of liberty,
and are angry that France should claim
a share of that precious property; by
which, however, she may surely be en∣riched,
without our being impoverished.
The French, on the contrary, seem to
have imbibed, with the principles of li∣berty,
the strongest sentiments of respect
and friendship towards that people, whom
they gratefully acknowledge to have been
their masters in this science. They are,
to use their own phrase,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Become madly fond of the English.</NOTE> “devenus fous
des Anglois,” and fondly imagine that
the applause they have received from a
society of philosophers in our country, is
the general voice of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="72"/>
Whether the new constitution be com∣posed
of durable materials or not, I leave
to politicians to determine; but it re∣quires
no extraordinary sagacity to pro∣nounce,
that the French will henceforth
be free. The love of liberty has per∣vaded
all ranks of the people, who, if its
blessings must be purchased with blood,
will not shrink from paying the price:
<Q><L>“While ev'n the peasant boasts his rights to scan,</L>
<L>And learns to venerate himself as man.”</L></Q>
The enthusiastic spirit of liberty displays
itself, not merely on the days of solemn
ceremonies—occupies not only every se∣rious
deliberation—but is mingled with
the gaiety of social enjoyment. When
they converse, liberty is the theme of dis∣course;
when they dance, the figure of
the cotillon is adapted to a national
tune; and when they sing, it is but to
repeat a vow of fidelity to the constitu∣tion,
at which all who are present in∣stantly
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
join in chorus, and sportively lift
up their hands in confirmation of this fa∣vourite
sentiment.</P>
<P>In every street, you see children per∣forming
the military exercise, and carry∣ing
banners made of paper of the na∣tional
colours, wearing grenadiers caps
of the same composition, and armed,
though not like Jack the Giant-killer,
with swords of sharpness.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, liberty appears in
France adorned with the freshness of
youth, and is loved with the ardour of
passion. In England she is seen in her
matron state, and, like other ladies at that
period, is beheld with sober veneration.</P>
<P>With respect to myself, I must ac∣knowledge,
that, in my admiration of the
revolution in France, I blend the feel∣ings
of private friendship with my sym∣pathy
in public blessings; since the old
constitution is connected in my mind with
the image of a friend confined in the
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
gloomy recesses of a dungeon, and pining
in hopeless captivity; while, with the new
constitution, I unite the soothing idea of
his return to prosperity, honours, and
happiness.</P>
<P>This person is Mons. du F—, whose
lady I am come to France to visit. They
are friends with whom I wept in the day
of their adversity, and with whom in
their prosperity I have hastened to re∣joice.
Their history is most affecting;
and, when I leave the hurry of Paris, to
accompany them to their Chateau in
Normandy, I will make you acquainted
with incidents as pathetic as romance it∣self
can furnish. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X.</HEAD>
<P>WE have been driving at a furious rate,
for several days past, through the city of
Paris, which I think bears the same re∣semblance
to London (if you will allow
me the indulgence of a simile) that the
grand natural objects in a rude and bar∣ren
country bear to the tame but regular
beauties of a scene rich with cultivation.
The streets of Paris are narrow, dark, and
dirty; but we are repaid for this by noble
edifices, which powerfully interest the at∣tention.
The streets of London are broad,
airy, light, and elegant; but I need not
tell you that they lead scarcely to any
edifices at which foreigners do not look
with contempt. London has, therefore,
most of the beautiful, and Paris of the
sublime, according to Mr. Burke's defi∣nition
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
of these qualities; for I assure you
a sensation of terror is not wanting to the
sublimity of Paris, while the coachman
drives through the streets with the impe∣tuosity
of a Frenchman, and one expects
every step the horses take will be fatal to
the foot-passengers, who are heard ex∣claiming,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the streets of Paris are aristocrates.</NOTE> “Que les rues de Paris sont
aristocrates.” By the way, <HI>aristocracie,</HI>
and <HI>à la nation,</HI> are become cant terms,
which, as <HI>Sterne</HI> said of <HI>tant pis,</HI> and <HI>tant
mieux,</HI> may now be considered as two of
the great hinges in French conversation.
Every thing tiresome or unpleasant, “c'est
une aristocracie!” and every thing charm∣ing
and agreeable is, “à la nation.”</P>
<P>I have seen all the fine buildings at
Paris, and fancy I should have admired
the façade of the Louvre, the beautiful
new church of St. Genevieve, and some
other edifices, even if I had not been
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
told previously, by a connoisseur in these
matters, the precise degree of admiration
which it was proper to bestow on every
public building in Paris: but, having re∣ceived
such minute instructions on this
subject, I can form but an imperfect no∣tion
of my own taste for architecture.</P>
<P>At the request of Madame Brulart,
Mons. de Chartres sent orders for our ad∣mission
to the Palais Royal, which is not
at present shewn to the public. Of the
collection of pictures I am incapable of
saying any thing, and enough has been
already said by those who understand its
merits. Fine painting gives me con∣siderable
pleasure, but has not the power
of calling forth my sensibility like fine
poetry; and I am willing to believe that
the art I love is the most perfect of the
two; and that it would have been impos∣sible
for the pencil of Raphael to convey
all those ideas to the mind, and excite all
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
those emotions in the heart, which are
awakened by the pen of Shakespeare.</P>
<P>I confess, the only picture in Paris which
has cost me any tears, is that of La Val∣liere,
in the convent of the Carmelites.
She is represented in the habit of a Car∣melite;
all the former ornaments of her
person lie scattered at her feet; and her
eyes are cast up to Heaven with a look of
the deepest anguish. While I gazed at
her picture, I lamented that sensibility
which led into the most fatal errors a mind
that seems to have been formed for virtue,
and which, even in the bosom of pleasure,
bewailed its own weakness. How can
one forbear regretting, that the capri∣cious
inconstant monarch, to whom she
gave her heart, should have inspired a
passion of which he was so unworthy;
a passion which appears to have been
wholly unmixed with interest, vanity, or
ambition? And how can one avoid pity∣ing
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
the desolate penitent, who, for so many
years, in the dismal gloom of a convent,
deplored her errors, and felt at once the
bitterness of remorse, and the agony of
disappointed love? while, probably,
<Q><L>“In every hymn she seem'd his voice to hear,</L>
<L>And dropt with every bead, too soft a tear!”</L></Q></P>
<P>If the figure of this beautiful Carmel∣ite
had not come across my imagination,
I should have told you sooner, that the
Palais Royal is a square, of which the
Duc de Orleans's palace forms one side.
You walk under piazzas round this square,
which is surrounded with coffee-houses,
and shops displaying a variety of ribbons,
trinkets, and caricature prints, which are
now as common at Paris as at London.
The walks under the piazzas are crouded
with people: and in the upper part of the
square, tents are placed, where coffee, le∣monade,
ices, &amp;c. are sold. Nothing is
heard but the voice of mirth; nothing is
seen but chearful faces; and I have no
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
doubt that the Palais Royal is, upon the
whole, one of the merriest scenes under
the sun. Indeed, what is most striking
to a stranger at Paris, is that general ap∣pearance
of gaiety, which it is easy to per∣ceive
is not assumed for the moment, but
is the habit of the mind, and which is,
therefore, so exhilarating to a spectator of
any benevolence. It is this which gives
such a charm to every public place and
walk in Paris. Kensington Gardens can
boast as fine verdure, as majestic trees,
as noble walks, and perhaps more beau∣tiful
women than the gardens of the
Tuilleries; but we shall look in vain for
that sprightly animation, that everlasting
chearfulness, which render the Tuilleries
so enchanting.</P>
<P>We have just returned from the Ho∣pital
des Invalides, a noble building, a∣dorned
with fine paintings which record
the history of some celebrated saints,
whose exploits were recounted with in∣credible
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
rapidity by the man who con∣ducted
us through the chapels, and who
seemed to think that nothing could be
more absurd than our curiosity, after ha∣ving
heard these stories from his lips, to
observe how they were told by the pain∣ters.</P>
<P>As we passed through the church, we
saw several old soldiers kneeling at the
confessionals, with that solemn devotion
which seemed undisturbed by our intru∣sion,
and fixed upon “the things that are
above.”</P>
<P>A few days before the taking of the
Bastille, a croud of the Parisians assem∣bled
at the Hopital des Invalides, and
demanded arms of the old soldiers; who
answered, that they were the friends of
their fellow citizens, but durst not deliver
up their arms without the appearance of
a contest; and therefore desired that the
people would assemble before the gates
in greater numbers the next day, when,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
after firing a little powder upon them,
they would throw down their arms. The
people accordingly returned the following
day; and the invalids, after a faint shew
of resistance, threw down their arms, which
the citizens took up, embraced the old
men, and then departed.</P>
<P>We stopped yesterday at La Maison
de Ville, and went into a large apartment
where the mayor and corporation assem∣ble.
The walls are hung round with pic∣tures
of Kings and Dukes, which I looked
at with much less respect than at the chair
on which Mons. Bailly sits. If his pic∣tures
should ever be placed in this apart∣ment,
I fancy that, in the estimation of
posterity, it will obtain precedency over
all the Princes in the collection.</P>
<P>As we came out of La Maison de
Ville, we were shewn, immediately op∣posite,
the far-famed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lamp-iron.</NOTE> lanterne, at which,
for want of a gallows, the first victims
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
of popular fury were sacrificed. I own
that the sight of La Lanterne chilled the
blood within my veins. At that mo∣ment,
for the first time, I lamented the
revolution; and, forgetting the impru∣dence,
or the guilt, of those unfortunate
men, could only reflect with horror on
the dreadful expiation they had made. I
painted in my imagination the agonies of
their families and friends, nor could I for
a considerable time chase these gloomy
images from my thoughts.</P>
<P>It is for ever to be regretted, that so
dark a shade of ferocious revenge was
thrown across the glories of the revolu∣tion.
But, alas! where do the records of
history point out a revolution unstained
by some actions of barbarity? When do
the passions of human nature rise to that
pitch which produces great events, with∣out
wandering into some irregularities?
If the French revolution should cost no
farther bloodshed, it must be allowed,
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
notwithstanding a few shocking instances
of public vengeance, that the liberty of
twenty-four millions of people will have
been purchased at a far cheaper rate than
could ever have been expected from the
former experience of the world.</P>

<P>WE are just returned from Versailles,
where I could not help fancying I saw, in
the back ground of that magnificent
abode of a despot, the gloomy dungeons
of the Bastille, which still haunt my ima∣gination,
and prevented my being much
dazzled by the splendour of this superb
palace.</P>
<P>We were shewn the passages through
which the Queen escaped from her own
apartment to the King's, on the memora∣ble
night when the <HI>Poissardes</HI> visited Ver∣sailles,
and also the balcony at which she
stood with the Dauphin in her arms, when,
after having remained a few hours con∣cealed
in some secret recess of the pa∣lace,
it was thought proper to comply
with the desire of the croud, who re∣peatedly
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
demanded her presence. I could
not help moralizing a little, on being told
that the apartment to which this balcony
belongs, is the very room in which Louis
the Fourteenth died; little suspecting
what a scene would, in the course of a
few years, be acted on that spot.</P>
<P>All the bread which could be procured
in the town of Versailles, was distributed
among the <HI>Poissardes;</HI> who, with savage
ferocity, held up their morsels of bread
on their bloody pikes, towards the bal∣cony
where the Queen stood, crying, in
a tone of defiance,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We now have bread.</NOTE> “Nous avons du
pain!”</P>
<P>During the whole of the journey from
Versailles to Paris, the Queen held the
Dauphin in her arms, who had been pre∣viously
taught to put his infant hands to∣gether,
and attempt to soften the enraged
multitude by repeating,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Spare mama!</NOTE> “Grace pour
maman!”</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="87"/>
Mons. de la Fayette prevented the
whole Gardes du Corps from being mas∣sacred
at Versailles, by calling to the in∣censed
poeple,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King begs of you to spare his body-guards.</NOTE> “Le Roi vous demande
grace pour ses Gardes du Corps.” The
voice of Mons. de la Fayette was listened
to, and obeyed. The Gardes du Corps
were spared; with whom, before they set
out for Paris, the people exchanged
clothes, giving them also national cock∣ades;
and, as a farther protection from
danger, part of the croud mounted on
the horses of the Gardes du Corps, each
man taking an officer behind him. Be∣fore
the King came out of La Maison
du Ville, Mons. de la Fayette appeared,
and told the multitude, who had pre∣served
an indignant silence the whole way
from Versailles to Paris, that the King
had expressed sentiments of the strongest
affection for his people, and had accepted
the national cockade; and that he (Mons.
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
de la Fayette) hoped, when his Majesty
came out of la Maison du Ville, they
would testify their gratitude. In a few
minutes the King appeared, and was re∣ceived
with the loudest acclamations.</P>
<P>When the Queen was lately asked to
give her deposition on the attempt which,
it is said, was made to assassinate her, by
the <HI>Poissardes</HI> at Versailles, she answered,
with great prudence, “<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I saw every thing, heard every thing, and have forgot every thing.</NOTE> Jai tout vu,
tout entendu, et tout oublié!”</P>
<P>The King is now extremely popular,
and the people sing in the streets to the
old tune of<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Long live Henry the Fourth. Long live Lewis the Sixteenth.</NOTE> “Vive Henri quatre! &amp;c.”
“Vive Louis seize!”</P>
<P>The Queen is, I am told, much altered
lately in her appearance, but she is still a
fine woman. Madame is a beautiful girl;
and the Dauphin, who is about seven years
of age, is the idol of the people. They
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
expect that he will be educated in the
principles of the new constitution, and will
be taught to consider himself less a king
than a citizen. He appears to be a sweet
engaging child, and I have just heard one
of his sayings repeated. He has a col∣lection
of animals, which he feeds with
his own hand. A few days ago, an un∣grateful
rabbit, who was his first favou∣rite,
bit his finger when he was giving him
food. The Prince, while smarting with
the pain, called out to his<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Little rabbit, Thou art an Aristocrate.—And pray, my Lord, what is an Aristocrate?—Those who make my papa uneasy.</NOTE> petit lapin,
“Tu ès Aristocrate.” One of the at∣tendants
enquired, “Eh! Monseigneur,
qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un Aristocrate.”
“Ce sont ceux,” answered the Prince,
“qui font de la peine à Papa.”</P>
<P>The King lately called the Queen, en
badinage, Madame Capet; to which she
retorted very readily, by giving his Ma∣jesty
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
the appellation of “Monsieur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capot is the French term at picquet, when the game is lost.</NOTE> <HI>Ca∣pet.</HI>”</P>
<P>When Les gardes Francoises laid down
their arms at Versailles, their officers en∣deavoured
to persuade them to take them
up. An officer of my acquaintance told
me, that he said to his soldiers,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">My friends, you are going then to forsake me; I possess none of your affection.—Captain, they answered, we all love you; and, if you will lead us against our enemies, we are all ready to follow you: but we will never fire at our fellow citizens.</NOTE> “Mes
enfans, vous allez donc me quitter, vous
ne m'aimez plus?” “Mon officier,” they
answered, “nous vous aimons tous, si il
s'agit d'aller contre nos ennemis, nous
sommes tous prets à vous suivre, mais
nous ne tirerons jamais contre nos com∣patriotes.”
Since that period, whenever
any of les gardes Francoises appear, they
are followed by the acclamations of the
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
people, and “<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Long live the French guards.</NOTE> Vive les Gardes Fran∣coises!”
resounds from every quarter.</P>
<P>While we were sitting, after dinner, at
the inn at Versailles, the door was sud∣denly
opened, and a Franciscan friar en∣tered
the room. He had so strong a re∣semblance
to Sterne's monk, that I am
persuaded he must be a descendant of
the same family. We could not, like
Sterne, bestow immortality; but we gave
some alms: and the venerable old monk,
after thanking us with affecting simplici∣ty,
added, spreading out his hands with a
slow and solemn movement,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Peace be with you.</NOTE> “Que la
paix soit avec vous,” and then departed.
I have been frequently put in mind of
Sterne since my arrival in France; and
the first post-boy I saw in jack-boots, ap∣peared
to me a very classical figure, by
recalling the idea of La Fleur mounted
on his bidet.</P>

<P>WE have been at all the Theatres,

The tragic performers afforded me much
less pleasure. Before we can admire
Madame Vestris, the first tragic actress

(a thing impossible) of Mrs. Sid∣dons's

“tearing a passion to rags,” like Madame
Vestris, only tears the hearts of the audi∣ence

<P>Most of the pieces we have seen at the

accompanyment of applause from some
hundreds of the national guards, the real
actors in the scenes represented. Between
the acts national songs are played, in
which the whole audience join in chorus.
There is one air, in particular, which is so
universal a favourite, that it is called “Le
Carrillon National:” the burden of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It will go on.</NOTE> “C'a ira.” It is sung not only
at every theatre, and in every street of
Paris, but in every town and village of
France, by man, woman, and child.
“C'a ira” is every where the signal of
pleasure, the beloved sound which ani∣mates
every bosom with delight, and of
which every ear is enamoured. And I
have heard the most serious political con∣versations
end by a sportive assurance, in
allusion to this song, que “C'a ira!”</P>
<P>Giornowiche, the celebrated player on
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
the violin, who was so much the fashion
last winter at London, I am told, some∣times
amused himself at Paris, by getting
up into one of the trees of the Palais
Royal, after it was dark, and calling forth
tones from his violin, fit to “take the
prison'd soul, and lap it in Elysium.” He
has frequently detained some thousands
of people half the night in the Palais
Royal, who, before they discovered the
performer, used to call out in rapture,
“Bravo, bravo;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is better than Giornowiche.</NOTE> c'est mieux que Gior∣nowiche.”</P>
<P>I am just returned from seeing the
Gobelin tapestry, which appears the work
of magic. It gave me pleasure to see
two pictures of Henry the Fourth. In
one, he is placed at supper with the mil∣ler's
family; and in the other, he is em∣bracing
Sully, who is brought forward on
a couch, after having been wounded in
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
battle. Nothing has afforded me more
delight, since I came to France, than the
honours which are paid to my favourite
hero, Henry the Fourth, whom I prefer
to all the Alexanders and Frederics that
ever existed. They may be terribly sub∣lime,
if you will, and have great claims
to my admiration; but as for my love,
all that portion of it which I bestow on
heroes, is already in Henry's possession.</P>
<P>Little statues of Henry the Fourth and
Sully are very common. Sully is repre∣sented
kneeling at the feet of this amiable
Prince, who holds out his hand to him;
and on the base of the statue, are written
the words which Sully records in his Me∣moirs:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">But rise, pray rise, Sully; they will believe I am forgiving you.</NOTE> “Mais levez vous, levez vous
donc, Sully, on croiroit que je vous par∣donne.”</P>
<P>While the statue of Henry the Fourth,
on the Pont-Neuf, is illuminated and de∣corated
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
with national ribbon, that of Louis
the Fourteenth, in the Place Victoire, is
stripped of its former ostentatious orna∣ments;
the nations, which were represented
enchained at his feet, having been remov∣ed
since the revolution. The figure of
Fame is, however, still left hovering be∣hind
the statue of the King, with a crown
of laurel in her hand, which, it is gene∣rally
supposed, she is going to place upon
his head. But I have heard of a French
wit, who enquired whether it was really
her intention to place the laurel on his
Majesty's head, or whether she had just
taken it off.</P>
<P>In our ride this morning, we stopped
at the Place Royale, where I was diverted
by reading, on the front of a little shop
under the piazzas, these words: “Robe∣lin,

<P>WE had a most agreeable journey from
Paris to Rouen, travelling a hundred miles
along the borders of the Seine, through a
beautiful country, richly wooded, and finely
diversified by hill and valley. We passed
several magnificent chateaus, and saw many
a spire belonging to Gothic edifices, which,
it would seem, were built of such lasting
materials, with the moral purpose of lead∣ing
the mind to reflect on the compara∣tively
short duration of human life. Fre∣quently
an old venerable cross, placed at
the side of the road by the piety of remote
ages, and never passed by Roman Catho∣lics
without some mark of respect, throws
a kind of religious sanctity over the land∣scape.</P>
<P>We stopped to look at the immense
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
machine which conveys water to Versailles
and Marly. The water is raised, by
means of this machine, sixty feet, and is
carried the distance of five hundred. I
never heard a sound which filled my mind
with more horror than the noise occasion∣ed
by the movements of this tremendous
machine; while, at the same time, the
vast chasms, where the water foams with
angry violence, make the brain giddy,
and I was glad to leave these images of
terror.</P>
<P>Part of our journey was performed by
moon-light, which slept most sweetly upon
the bank, and spread over the landscape
those softened graces which I will not at∣tempt
to describe, lest my pen should
stray into rhyme.</P>
<P>We passed the chateau of Rosni, a
noble domain given to Sully by Henry
the Fourth; a testimony of that friend∣ship
which reflects equal honour on the
King and the Minister.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="100"/>
About three leagues from Rouen stands
a convent, of which Abelard was for some
time the superior. It is still inhabited by
a few monks, and is called Le Couvent
de deux Amans. Had it been the mona∣stery
of the Paraclete, the residence of
Eloisa, I should have hastened to visit the
spot,
<Q><L>“Where, o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,</L>
<L>Long sounding isles, and intermingled graves,</L>
<L>Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws</L>
<L>A death-like silence, and a dread repose;</L>
<L>Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,</L>
<L>Shades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry green,</L>
<L>Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,</L>
<L>And breathes a browner horror on the woods.”</L></Q></P>
<P>If it were not very difficult to be an∣gry
with such a poet as Pope, particu∣larly
after having just transcribed these ex∣quisite
lines, I should be so when I recol∣lect
how clearly Mr. Berington shows, in
his History of Abelard and Eloisa, the
cruel injustice done by Pope to the senti∣ments
of Eloisa, who is too often made to
speak a very different language in the
poem, from that of her genuine letters.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="101"/>
On our way to Rouen we slept at Gal∣lon,
a town about five leagues distant.
Our inn was close to the castle, which for∣merly
belonged to the Archbishop of
Rouen, and which is now the property of
the nation. The castle is a venerable
gothic building, with a fine orangery, and
parks which extend several leagues. The
Archbishop, who is the Cardinal de la
Rochefoucault, brother to that distin∣guished
patriot the ci devant Duc de la
Rochefoucault, has lost a very considera∣ble
revenue since the revolution. He
had an immense train of servants, whom
it is said he dismissed, upon the dimi∣nution
of his income, with all possible
gentleness, giving horses to one, a carriage
to another, and endeavouring to bestow
on all some little alleviation of the pain
they felt at quitting so good a master.
It is impossible not to regret that the
property of the Cardinal de la Rochefou∣cault
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
is diminished, by whom it was only
employed in dispensing happiness.</P>
<P>After visiting the castle, I returned
somewhat in mournful mood to the
inn, where there was nothing calcula∣ted
to convey one chearful idea. The
cieling of our apartment was crossed with
old bare beams; the tapestry, with which
the room was hung, displayed, like the
dress of Otway's old woman, “variety
of wretchedness;” the canopied beds
were of coarse dirty stuff; two pictures,
in tawdry gilt frames, slandered the sweet
countenances of the Dauphin and Ma∣dame;
and the floor was paved with
brick. In short, one can scarcely imagine
a scene more remote from England, in
accommodation and comfort, than the
country inns of France: yet, in this ha∣bitation,
where an Englishman would
have been inclined to hang himself, was
my rest disturbed half the night by the
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
merry songs which were sung in an ad∣joining
apartment, as gloomy as my own.
But those local circumstances, which affect
English nerves, never disturb the peace
of that happy people, by whom, whether
engaged in taking the Bastille, or sitting
with their friends after supper,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every thing is done singing.</NOTE> tout se

<P>ROUEN is one of the largest and
most commercial towns of France. It
is situated on the banks of the Seine, has
a fine quay, and a singular bridge, of
barges placed close together, with planks
fixed upon them: the bridge rises and
sinks with the tide, and opens for vessels
to pass.</P>
<P>The streets of Rouen are so narrow,
dark, and frightful, that, to borrow an ex∣pression
from Madame Sevigné,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“They abuse the permission the French streets have of being ugly.”</NOTE> “elles
abusent de la permission qu'ont les rues
Françoises d'étre ladies.” There are
many figures of Saints to be seen from
these ugly streets, placed in little niches
in the walls. The Virgin Mary is seated
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
in one of these niches, with the infant in
her arms; and in the neighbourhood is
St. Anne, who has the credit of having
taught the Virgin to read. Every night
the general darkness of the town is a lit∣tle
dispelled by the lamps which the peo∣ple
place in the niches,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“To light the Saints.”</NOTE> “pour eclairer
les Saintes.”</P>
<P>Rouen is surrounded by fine boule∣vards,
that form very beautiful walks.
On the top of the hill of S<SUP>te</SUP> Catharine,
which overlooks the town, are the ruins
of a fort called St. Michell, from which
Henry the Fourth besieged Rouen. I
love to be put in mind of Henry the
Fourth, and am therefore very well pleased,
that whenever I go to walk, I can fix my
eyes on the hill of S<SUP>te</SUP> Catharine.</P>
<P>I always feel a little ashamed of my
country, when I pass the spot where the
Maid of Orleans was executed, and on
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
which her statue stands, a monument of
our disgrace. The ashes of her persecu∣tor,
John Duke of Bedford, repose at no
great distance, within a tomb of black
marble, in the cathedral, which was built
by the English. One cannot feel much
respect for the judgment of our ancestors,
in chusing, of all places under the sun, the
cathedral of Rouen for the tomb of him
whose name is transmitted to us with the
epithet of the <HI>good</HI> Duke of Bedford: for
you have scarcely left the cathedral, be∣fore
the statue of Jean d'Arc stares you
in the face, and seems to cast a most for∣midable
shade over the <HI>good</HI> Duke's vir∣tues.</P>
<P>The cathedral is a very magnificent
edifice, and the great bell is ten feet high,
and weighs thirty-six thousand pounds.
But in France it is not what is <HI>antient,</HI>
but what is <HI>modern,</HI> that most powerfully
engages attention. Nothing in this fine
old cathedral interested me so much as
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
the consecrated banner, which, since the
Federation, has been placed over the al∣tar,
and on which is inscribed, “<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let us live free, or die!</NOTE> Vivons
libres, ou mourir!” I hope every French∣man,
who enters the cathedral of Rouen,
while he reads the inscription on this con∣secrated
banner, repeats from the bottom
of his soul,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Let us live free, or die!</NOTE> “Vivons libres ou mourir!”
But the French will, I trust, escape the
horrors of civil war, notwithstanding the
gloomy forebodings of the enemies of the
new constitution.</P>
<P>A people just delivered from the yoke
of oppression, will surely have little incli∣nation
to resume their shackles; to re∣build
the dungeons they have so lately de∣molished;
to close again those gloomy
monastic gates which are now thrown
open; to exchange their new courts of
judicature, founded on the basis of justice
and humanity, for the caprice of power,
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
and the dark iniquity of lettres de cachét;
to quench the fair star of liberty, which
has arisen on their hemisphere, and suffer
themselves to be once more guided by
the meteor of despotism.</P>
<P>A very considerable number, even
among the nobility of France, have had
the virtue to support the cause of free∣dom;
and, forgetting the little considera∣tions
of vanity, which have some impor∣tance
in the ordinary course of human
affairs, but which are lost and annihilated
when the mind is animated by any great
sentiment, they have chosen to become
the benefactors rather than the oppressors
of their country; the citizens of a free
state, instead of the slaves of a despotic
monarch. They will no longer bear
arms to gratify the ambition, or the ca∣price
of a minister; they will no longer
exert that impetuous and gallant spirit, for
which they have ever been distinguished,
in any cause unworthy of its efforts. The
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
fire of valour, which they have too often
employed for the purposes of destruction,
will henceforth be directed to more ge∣nerous
ends. They will chuse another path
to renown. Instead of attempting to take
the citadel of glory by storm, they will
prefer the fame of an honourable defence,
and, renouncing the sanguinary laurel,
strive, with more exalted enthusiasm, to
obtain the civic wreath. Yes, the French
nation will inviolably guard, will transmit
to posterity the sacred rights of freedom.
Future ages will celebrate, with grateful
commemoration, the fourteenth of July;
and strangers, when they visit France, will
hasten with impatience to the Champ de
Mars, filled with that enthusiasm which is
awakened by the view of a place where
any great scene has been acted. I think
I hear them exclaim, “Here the Fede∣ration
was held! here an assembled na∣tion
devoted themselves to freedom!” I
fancy I see them pointing out the spot on
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
which the altar of the country stood. I
see them eagerly searching for the place
where they have heard it recorded, that
the National Assembly were seated! I
think of these things, and then repeat to
myself with transport, “<HI>I</HI> was a spectator
of the Federation!”</P>
<P>But these meditations have led me to
travel through the space of so many cen∣turies,
that it is really difficult to get back
again to the present times. Did you ex∣pect
that I should ever dip my pen in po∣litics,
who used to take so small an inte∣rest
in public affairs, that I recollect a
gentleman of my acquaintance surprized
me not a little, by informing me of the
war between the Turks and the Russians,
at a time when all the people of Europe,
except myself, had been two years in pos∣session
of this intelligence?</P>
<P>If, however, my love of the French re∣volution
requires an apology, you shall
receive one in a very short time; for I
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
am going to Mons. du F—'s chateau,
and will send you from thence the history
of his misfortunes. They were the in∣flictions
of tyranny, and you will rejoice
with me that tyranny is no more.</P>
<P>Before I close my letter, I shall mention
a singular privilege of the church of
Rouen, which is the power of setting free
a murderer every year on the day of As∣cension.
It seems that in the time of
King Dagobert, who reigned in the sixth
century, a horrible and unrelenting dra∣gon
desolated the country, sparing neither
man nor beast. St. Romain, who was
then Bishop of Rouen, asked for two cri∣minals
to assist him in an enterprize he
had the courage to meditate against the
dragon; and with these aides de camp he
sallied forth, killed the monster, and deli∣vered
the country. In consequence of
this miracle, Dagobert gave the successors
of St. Romain the privilege of setting a
murderer free every year on Ascension∣day.
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
The bones of St. Romain are car∣ried
by the criminal in a gilt box through
the streets: the figure of a hideous ani∣mal
representing the dragon, though it is
suspected of slandering his countenance,
accompanies these venerable bones, and
has generally a young living wolf placed
in its maw, except when it is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fast-day.</NOTE> jour mai∣gre,
and then the dragon is provided with
a large fish. The counsellors of the parlia∣ment,
dressed in their scarlet robes, attend
this procession to a church, where high
mass is said; and, these ceremonies being
performed, the criminal is set at liberty.
But it is only when there are some strong
alleviating circumstances in the case of the
offender, that he is suffered in this manner
to evade the punishment of his crimes.</P>
<P>Yesterday, in a little town called Sotte
Ville, joined to Rouen by the bridge, a
political dispute arose between the Curé
and his parishioners. The enraged Curé
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
exclaimed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">You are an assembly of asses.</NOTE> “Vous étés une assemblée
d'anes.” To which one of the parishion∣ers

<P>I HEARD<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The military mass.</NOTE> La messe militaire, on
Sunday last, at a church where all the
national guard of Rouen attended. The
service began with the loudest thunder of
drums and trumpets, and seemed more
like a signal for battle than for devotion;
but the music soon softened into the most
foothing sounds, which flowed from the
organ, clarinets, flutes, and hautboys; the
priests chanted, and the people made re∣sponses.
The wax tapers were lighted,
holy water was sprinkled on the ground,
incense was burnt at the altar, and the
elevation of the host was announced by
the sound of the drum; upon which the
people knelt down, and the priest pros∣trated
his face towards the earth. There
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
is something affecting in the pomp and
solemnity of these ceremonies. Indeed,
the Roman Catholic worship, though a
sad stumbling-block to reason, is striking
to the imagination. I have more than
once heard the service for the dead per∣formed,
and never can hear it without
emotion; without feeling that in those
melancholy separations, which bury every
hope of the survivor in the relentless
grave, the heart that can delude itself with
the belief, that its prayers may avail any
thing to the departed object of its affec∣tions,
must find consolation in thus unit∣ing
a tribute of tenderness, with the per∣formance
of a religious duty.</P>
<P>We have been at several convents at
Rouen. The first to which we went was a
convent of Benedictine Nuns. When
we had entered the gates we rang a bell,
and a servant appeared, and desired us to
go up stairs to the parloir. We opened
a wrong door, and found, in a room grated
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
across the middle with iron bars, a young
man sitting on one side of the grate, and
a young nun on the other. I could not
help thinking that the heart of this young
man was placed in a perilous situation;
for where can a young woman appear so
interesting, as when seen within that
gloomy barrier, which death alone can
remove? What is there, in all the osten∣tation
of female dress, so likely to affect a
man of sensibility, as that dismal habit
which seems so much at variance with
youth and beauty, and is worn as the me∣lancholy
symbol of an eternal renuncia∣tion
of the world and all its pleasures?
We made an apology to the nun for our
intrusion, and she directed us to another
apartment, where, a few minutes after we
had seated ourselves on one side of the
grate, La Depositaire entered on the
other, and told us that the Abbess, whom
we had desired to see, was not yet risen
from dinner, and La Depositaire hoped
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
we would wait a little.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Because, said she, the Abbess was obliged to rise from table very soon yesterday, and found herself a little indisposed.</NOTE> “Parceque,”
said she, “Madame l'Abbesse etoit obli∣gée
hier de se lever de table de bonne
heure, et elle se trouvoit une peu incom∣modée.”
You must observe that the
Abbesse dined at three o'clock, and it was
now past six. At length this lady, who
was so fond of long dinners, appeared.
She is a woman of fifty, but is still hand∣some;
has a frank agreeable countenance,
fine eyes, and had put on her veil in a
very becoming manner. We wished to
be admitted to the interior part of the
convent, and with this view a French
gentleman, who was of our party,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Told a great many fables to the Abbess.</NOTE> “se
mit à conter des histoires à Madame
l'Abbesse.”</P>
<P>He told her that my sister and I, though
English women, were catholics, and wished
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
to be received into the convent, and even,
if it had been possible, to take the vows.
The Abbess enquired if he was quite sure
of our being catholics; upon which the
gentleman, a little puzzled what to an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer,
insinuated that Mons. du F—had
probably the merit of our conversion.
“But I have heard,” said the Abbess,
“from Madame—, that Mons. du
F—has become a protestant himself.”
Mons. du F—, who is truth itself,
av<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed his principles without hesitation;
while the Abbess, turning to La Deposi∣taire,
exclaimed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How amiable he is! what noble sentiments! Ah, Sir, you are too good for God to leave you in error.</NOTE> “Mais comme Mons.
est aimable! quel beaux sentiments! Ah
Mons. vous étés trop bon pour que Dieu
vous laisse dans l'erreur.” “St. Augus∣tin,”
continued she, “had once some
doubts; I hope you will be a second St.
Augustin: myself, and all my communi∣ty,
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
will pray for your conversion.” La
Depositaire, who was a tall thin old wo∣man,
with a sharp malignant countenance,
added, casting a look on Mons. du F—full
of the contempt of superior know∣ledge,
“It is not surprizing that a young
man, after passing several years in Eng∣land,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> country of heretics, should find
his faith somewhat shaken; but he only
wants to be enlightened by Mons. le Curé
de—, who will immediately dissipate
all his doubts.”</P>
<P>From the Convent of the Benedictines
we went to that of the Carmelites, where
religion, which was meant to be a source
of happiness in this world, as well as in
the next, wears an aspect of the most
gloomy horror. When we entered the
convent, it seemed the residence of silence
and solitude: no voice was heard, no hu∣man
creature appeared; and when we
rang the bell, a person, whom we could
not see, enquired, through a hole in the
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
wall, what we wanted. On being in∣formed
that we wished to speak to the Su∣perieure,
putting her hand through the
hole, she gave us a key, and desired us
to unlock the door of the parloir. This
we accordingly did; and in a few minutes
the Superieure came to a thick double
grate, with a curtain drawn at the inside,
to prevent the possibility of being seen.
Our French gentleman again talked of
our desire to enter the convent, and beg∣ged
to know the rules. A hollow voice
answered, that the Carmelites rose at four
in the morning in summer, and five in
the winter:—“Obedient slumbers, that
can wake and weep!”—That they slept
in their coffins, upon straw, and every
morning dug a shovel-full of earth for
their graves; that they walked to their
devotional exercises upon their knees;
that when any of their friends visited them,
if they spoke, they were not suffered to be
seen, or if they were seen, they were not
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
suffered to speak; that with them it was
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Always a fast.</NOTE> toujours maigre, and they only tasted
food twice a day.</P>
<P>Our Frenchman said, “<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These young ladies, Madam, must consider whether these regulations will suit them.</NOTE> Il faut Ma∣dame
que ses demoiselles reflechissent, si
cela leurs convient.” The poor Carme∣lite
agreed that the matter required some
reflection, and we departed.</P>
<P>As we returned home meditating on the
lot of a Carmelite, we met in the street
three nuns walking in the habit of their
order. Upon enquiry, we were told that
they had been forced by their parents to
take the veil, and, since the decree of the
National Assembly giving them liberty,
they had obtained permission to pay a vi∣sit
for three months to some friends who
sympathized in their unhappiness, and
were now on their journey.</P>
<P>The monks and nuns must in a short
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
time decide whether they will finally leave
their cloisters or not; and the religious
houses which are vacated will be sold. In
the department of Rouen a calculation
has been made, that, after paying every
monk seven hundred, and every nun five
hundred livres a year, out of the revenues
of the religious houses, the department
will gain sixty thousand livres a year. The
monks and nuns above sixty years of age,
who chuse to leave their convents, will be
allowed an annual pension of nine hun∣dred
livres.</P>
<P>A letter was read in the National As∣sembly,
a few days ago, from a priest, in∣treating
that the clergy might have per∣mission
to marry; a privilege which it is
thought the Assembly will soon autho∣rize.

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>I Embrace the first hours of leisure, which
I have found since my arrival at the
chateau, to send you the history of my
friends.</P>
<P>Antoine Augustin Thomás du F—,
eldest son of the Baron du F—, Coun∣sellor
of the Parliament of Normandy,
was born on the fifteenth of July, 1750.
His early years were embittered by the
severity of his father, who was of a dispo∣sition
that preferred the exercise of do∣mestic
tyranny to the blessings of social
happiness, and chose rather to be dreaded
than beloved. The endearing name of
father conveyed no transport to <HI>his</HI> heart,
which, being wrapt up in stern insensibi∣lity,
was cold even to the common feel∣ings
of nature.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="126"/>
The Baron's austerity was not indeed
confined to his son, but extended to all
his dependants. Formed by nature for
the support of the antient government of
France, he maintained his aristocratic
rights with unrelenting severity, ruled his
feudal tenures with a rod of iron, and con∣sidered
the lower order of people as a set
of beings whose existence was tolerated
merely for the use of the nobility. The
poor, he believed, were only born for suf∣fering;
and he determined, as far as in
him lay, not to deprive them of their na∣tural
inheritance. On the whole, if it
were the great purpose of human life to
be hated, perhaps no person ever attained
that end more completely than the Baron
Du F—.</P>
<P>His son discovered early a taste for li∣terature,
and received an education suit∣able
to his rank and fortune. As he ad∣vanced
in life, the treatment he experi∣enced
from his father became more and
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
more intolerable to him, as, far from in∣heriting
the same character, he possessed
the most amiable dispositions, and the
most feeling heart.</P>
<P>His mother, feeble alike in mind and
body, submitted with the helplessness, and
almost with the thoughtlessness of a child,
to the imperious will of her husband.
Their family was increased by two more
sons, and two daughters; but these chil∣dren,
being several years younger than
Mons. Du F—, were not of an age to
afford him the consolations of friendship;
and the young man would have found
his situation intolerable, but for the sym∣pathy
of a person, in whose society every
evil was forgotten.</P>
<P>This person, his attachment to whom
has tinctured the colour of his life, was
the youngest of eight children, of a re∣spectable
family of Bourgeois at Rouen.
There is great reason to believe that her
father was descended from the younger
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
branch of a noble family of the same
name, and bearing the same arms. But,
unhappily, some links were wanting in
this chain of honourable parentage. The
claim to nobility could not be traced to
the entire satisfaction of the Baron; who,
though he would have dispensed with any
moral qualities in favour of rank, consi∣dered
obscure birth as a radical stain,
which could not be wiped off by all the
virtues under heaven. He looked upon
marriage as merely a convention of inte∣rest,
and children as a property, of which
it was reasonable for parents to make the
most in their power.</P>
<P>The father of Mad<SUP>selle</SUP>^ Monique C—was
a farmer, and died three months be∣fore
the birth of this child; who, with
seven other children, was educated with
the utmost care by their mother, a wo∣man
of sense and virtue, beloved by all
to whom she was known. It seemed as
if this respectable woman had, after the
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
death of her husband, only supported life
for the sake of her infant family, from
whom she was snatched by death, the
moment her maternal cares became no
longer necessary; her youngest daughter,
Monique, having, at this period, just at∣tained
her twentieth year. Upon the
death of her mother, Monique went to
live with an aunt, with whom she remain∣ed
only a very short time, being invited
by Madame du F—, to whom she was
well known, to come and live with her
as an humble companion, to read to her
when she was disposed to listen, and to
enliven the sullen grandeur of the cha∣teau,
by her animating vivacity.</P>
<P>This young person had cultivated her
excellent understanding by reading, and
her heart stood in no need of cultivation.
Mons. Du F—found in the charms of
her conversation, and in the sympathy of
her friendship, the most soothing conso∣lation
under the rigor of parental tyranny.
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
Living several years beneath the same
roof, he had constant opportunities of ob∣serving
her disposition and character;
and the passion with which she at length
inspired him, was founded on the lasting
basis of esteem.</P>
<P>If it was ever pardonable to deviate
from that law, in the code of interest and
etiquette, which forbids the heart to lis∣ten
to its best emotions; which, stifling
every generous sentiment of pure disinte∣rested
attachment, sacrifices love at the
shrine of avarice or ambition; the vir∣tues
of Monique were such as might ex∣cuse
this deviation. Yes, the character,
the conduct of this amiable person, have
nobly justified her lover's choice. How
long might he have vainly sought, in the
highest classes of society, a mind so ele∣vated
above the common mass!—a mind
that, endowed with the most exquisite sen∣sibility,
has had sufficient firmness to sus∣tain,
with a calm and equal spirit, every
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
transition of fortune; the most severe
trials of adversity, and perhaps what is
still more difficult to bear, the trial of
high prosperity.</P>
<P>Mons. Du F—had been taught, by
his early misfortunes, that domestic hap∣piness
was the first good of life. He had
already found, by experience, the insuffi∣ciency
of rank and fortune to confer en∣joyment;
and he determined to seek it
in the bosom of conjugal felicity. He
determined to pass his life with her whose
society now seemed essential not only to
his happiness, but to his very existence.</P>
<P>At the solemn hour of midnight, the
young couple went to a church, where
they were met by a priest whom Mons.
Du F—had made the confident of his
attachment, and by whom the marriage
ceremony was performed.</P>
<P>Some time after, when the situation of
his wife obliged Mons. Du F—to ac∣knowledge
their marriage to his mother,
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
she assured her son that she would wil∣lingly
consent to receive his wife as her
daughter, but for the dread of his father's
resentment. Madame Du F—, with
tears of regret, parted with Monique,
whom she placed under the protection of
her brothers: they conducted her to
Caen, where she was soon after delivered
of a son.</P>
<P>The Baron Du F—was absent
while these things were passing: he had
been suspected of being the author of a
pamphlet written against the princes of
the blood, and an order was issued to
seize his papers, and conduct him to the
Bastille; but he found means to escape
into Holland, where he remained nearly
two years. Having made his peace with
the ministry, he prepared to come home;
but before he returned, Mons. Du F—received
intelligence that his father, irri∣tated
almost to madness by the informa∣tion
of his marriage, was making appli∣cation
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
for a lettre de cachet, in order to
confine his daughter-in-law for the rest of
her life; and had also obtained power to
have his son seized and imprisoned.
Upon this Mons. Du F—and his wife
fled with precipitation to Geneva, leav∣ing
their infant at nurse near Gaen. The
Genevois seemed to think that the un∣fortunate
situation of these strangers, gave
them a claim to all the offices of friend∣ship.
After an interval of many years,
I have never heard Mons. or Madame
Du F—recall the kindness they re∣ceived
from that amiable people, without
tears of tenderness and gratitude.</P>
<P>Meanwhile the Baron, having disco∣vered
the place of his son's retreat, ob∣tained,
in the name of the King, permis∣sion
from the cantons of Berne and Fri∣burg
to arrest them at Lausanne, where
they had retired for some months. The
wife of Le Seigneur Baillif secretly gave
the young people notice of this design,
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
and on the thirtieth of January, 1775,
they had just time to make their escape,
with only a few livres in their pockets,
and the clothes in which they were dressed.
Mons. Du F—, upon his first going to
Switzerland, had lent thirty louis to a friend
in distress. He now, in this moment of
necessity, desired to be repaid, and was
promised the money within a month:
mean time, he and his wife wandered from
town to town, without finding any place
where they could remain in security.
They had spent all their small stock of
money, and were almost without clothes:
but at the expiration of the appointed
time, the thirty louis were paid, and with
this fund Mons. and Madame Du F—determined
to take shelter in the only
country which could afford them a safe
asylum from persecution, and immediately
set off for England, travelling through
Germany, and part of Holland, to avoid
passing through France.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135"/>
They embarked at Rotterdam, and,
after a long and gloomy passage, arrived
late at night at London. A young man,
who was their fellow passenger, had the
charity to procure them a lodging in a
garret, and directed them where to pur∣chase
a few ready-made clothes. When
they had remained in this lodging the
time necessary for becoming parishioners,
their banns were published in the church of
St. Anne, Westminster, where they were
married by the Curate of the parish.
They then went to the chapel of the
French Ambassador, and were again mar∣ried
by his Chaplain; after which Mons.
Du F—told me,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The new-married couple kept a fast in their little apartment.</NOTE> “Les deux epoux
vinrent faire maigre chair à leur petite
chambre.”</P>
<P>Mons. Du F—endeavoured to ob∣tain
a situation at a school, to teach the
French language; but before such a situa∣tion
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
could be found, his wife was deli∣vered
of a girl. Not having sufficient
money to hire a nurse, he attended her
himself. At this period they endured all
the horrors of absolute want. Unknown
and unpitied, without help or support, in
a foreign country, and in the depth of a
severe winter, they almost perished with
cold and hunger. The unhappy mother
lay stretched upon the same bed with her
new-born infant, who in vain implored
her succour, want of food having dried
up that source of nourishment. The wo∣man,
at whose house they lodged, and
whom they had for some weeks been un∣able
to pay, after many threatenings, at
length told them that they must depart the
next morning. Madame Du F—was
at this time scarcely able to walk across
her chamber, and the ground was covered
with snow. They had already exhausted
every resource; they had sold their
watches, their clothes, to satisfy the crav∣ings
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
of hunger; every mode of relief was
fled—every avenue of hope was closed—and
they determined to go with their in∣fant
to the suburbs of the town, and there,
seated on a stone, wait with patience for
the deliverance of death. With what an∣guish
did this unfortunate couple pre∣pare
to leave their last miserable retreat!
With how many bitter tears did they bathe
that wretched infant, whom they could no
longer save from perishing!</P>
<P>Oh, my dear, my ever beloved friends!
when I recollect that I am not at this mo∣ment
indulging the melancholy cast of my
own disposition, by painting imaginary
distress; when I recollect not only that
these were real sufferings, but that they
were sustained by <HI>you!</HI> my mind is over∣whelmed
with its own sensations.—The
paper is blotted by my tears—and I can
hold my pen no longer.</P>

<Q><L>—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thomson.</NOTE> “THE moral world,</L>
<L>Which though to us it seem perplex'd, moves on</L>
<L>In higher order; fitted, and impell'd,</L>
<L>By Wisdom's finest hand, and issuing all</L>
<L>In universal good.”</L></Q>
<P>Mons. and Madame du F—were
relieved from this extremity of distress at
a moment so critical, and by means so
unexpected, that it seemed the hand of
Heaven visibly interposing in behalf of
oppressed virtue. Early in the morning
of that fatal day when they were to leave
their last sad shelter, Mons. du F—went
out, and, in the utmost distraction of
mind, wandered through some of the
streets in the neighbourhood. He was
stopped by a gentleman whom he had
known at Geneva, and who told him that
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
he was then in search of his lodging, ha∣ving
a letter to deliver to him from a
Genevois clergyman. Mons. du F—opened
the letter, in which he was in∣formed
by his friend, that, fearing he
might be involved in difficulties, he had
transmitted ten guineas to a banker in
London, and intreated Mons. du F—would
accept that small relief, which was
all he could afford, as a testimony of friend∣ship.
Mons. du F—flew to the ban∣ker's,
received the money as the gift of
Heaven, and then, hastening to his wife
and child, bade them live a little longer.</P>
<P>A short time after, he obtained a situ∣ation
as French usher at a school; and
Madame du F—, when she had a little
recovered her strength, put out her infant
to nurse, and procured the place of
French teacher at a boarding-school.
They were now enabled to support their
child, and to repay the generous assistance
of their kind friend at Geneva. At this
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
period they heard of the death of their
son, whom they had left at Caen.</P>
<P>Mons. and Madame du F—passed
two years in this situation, when they were
again plunged into the deepest distress.
A French jeweller was commissioned by
the Baron du F—, to go to his son, and
propose to him conditions of reconciliation.
This man told Mons. du F—that his
father was just recovered from a severe
and dangerous illness, and that his eldest
daughter had lately died. These things,
he said, had led him to reflect with some
pain on the severity he had exercised to∣wards
his son; that the feelings of a pa∣rent
were awakened in his bosom; and
that if Mons. du F—would throw
himself at his father's feet, and ask for∣giveness,
he would not fail to obtain it,
and would be allowed a pension, on which
he might live with his wife in England. In
confirmation of these assurances, this man
produced several letters which he had re∣ceived
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
from the Baron to that effect; who,
as a farther proof of his sincerity, had given
this agent seven hundred pounds to put
into the hands of Mons. du F—for the
support of his wife and child during his
absence. The agent told him, that he
had not been able to bring the money to
England, but would immediately give
him three drafts upon a merchant of re∣putation
in London, with whom he had
connections in business; the first draft
payable in three months, the second in
six, and the third in nine.</P>
<P>Mons. du F—long deliberated upon
these proposals. He knew too well the
vindictive spirit of his father, not to feel
some dread of putting himself into his
power. But his agent continued to give
him the most solemn assurances of safety;
and Mons. du F—thought it was not
improbable that his sister's death might
have softened the mind of his father. He
reflected that his marriage had disap∣pointed
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
those ambitious hopes of a great
alliance, which his father had fondly in∣dulged,
and to whom he owed at least
the reparation of hastening to implore his
forgiveness when he was willing to bestow
it. What also weighed strongly on his
mind was the consideration that the sum
which his father had offered to deposit for
the use of his wife, would, in case any
sinister accident should befal him, afford
a small provision for her and his infant.</P>
<P>The result of these deliberations was,
that Mons. du F—determined (and
who can much blame his want of pru∣dence?)
he determined to confide in a
father!—to trust in that instinctive affec∣tion,
which, far from being connected
with any peculiar sensibility of mind, it
requires only to be a parent to feel—an
affection, which, not confined to the hu∣man
heart, softens the ferociousness of the
tyger, and speaks with a voice that is
heard amidst the howlings of the desart.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="143"/>
Mons. du F—, after the repeated pro∣mises
of his father, almost considered that
suspicion which still hung upon his mind,
as a crime. But, lest it might be possi∣ble
that this agent was commissioned to
deceive him, he endeavoured to melt him
into compassion for his situation. He
went to the village where his child was at
nurse, and, bringing her six miles in his
arms, presented her to this man, telling
him, that the fate of that poor infant rested
upon his integrity. The man took the
innocent creature in his arms, kissed her,
and then, returning her to her father, re∣newed
all his former assurances. Mons.
du F—listened and believed. Alas!
how difficult is it for a good heart to sus∣pect
human nature of crimes which make
one blush for the species! How hard is
it for a mind glowing with benevolence,
to believe that the bosom of another har∣bours
the malignity of a demon!</P>
<P>Mons. du F—now fixed the time
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
for his departure with his father's agent,
who was to accompany him to Normandy.
Madame du F—saw the preparations
for his journey with anguish which she
could ill conceal. But she felt that the
delicacy of her situation forbad her inter∣ference.
It was she who had made him
an alien from his family, and an exile
from his country. It was for her, that, re∣nouncing
rank, fortune, friends, and con∣nections,
all that is esteemed most valua∣ble
in life, he had suffered the last extre∣mity
of want, and now submitted to a
state of drudgery and dependance. Would
he not have a right to reproach her weak∣ness,
if she attempted to oppose his recon∣ciliation
with his father, and exerted that
influence which she possessed over his
mind, in order to detain him in a situa∣tion
so remote from his former expecta∣tions?
She was, therefore, sensible, that
the duty, the gratitude she owed her hus∣band,
now required on her part the ab∣solute
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
sacrifice of her own feelings: she
suffered without complaint, and endea∣voured
to resign herself to the will of
Heaven.</P>
<P>The day before his departure, Mons.
du F—went to take leave of his little
girl. At this moment a dark and melan∣choly
presage seemed to agitate his mind.
He pressed the child for a long while
to his bosom, and bathed it with his
tears. The nurse eagerly enquired what
was the matter, and assured him that the
child was perfectly well. Mons. du F—had
no power to reply: he continued
clasping his infant in his arms, and at
length, tearing himself from her in silence,
he rushed out of the house.</P>
<P>When the morning of his departure
came, Madame du F—, addressing
herself to his fellow-traveller, said to him,
with a voice of supplication, “I entrust
you, Sir, with my husband, with the father
of my poor infant, our sole protector and
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
support!—have compassion on the widow
and the orphan!” The man, casting
upon her a gloomy look, gave her a cold
answer, which made her soul shrink within
her. When Mons. du F—got into
the Brighthelmstone stage, he was unable
to bid her farewell; but when the carriage
drove off, he put his head out of the win∣dow,
and continued looking after her,
while she fixed her eyes on him, and
might have repeated with Imogen,
<Q><L>“I would have broke mine eye-strings;</L>
<L>Crack'd them, but to look upon him; till the
diminution</L>
<L>Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;</L>
<L>Nay, followed him, till he had melted from</L>
<L>The smallness of a gnat to air; and then—</L>
<L>Then turn'd mine eye and wept!”</L></Q>
When the carriage was out of sight, she
summoned all her strength, and walked
with trembling steps to the school where
she lived as a teacher. With much dif∣ficulty
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
she reached the door; but her
limbs could support her no longer, and
she fell down senseless at the threshold.
She was carried into the house, and re∣stored
to life and the sensations of mi∣sery.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MONS. du F—arrived at his fa∣ther's
chateau in Normandy, in June
1778, and was received by Mons. le
Baron, and all his family, with the most
affectionate cordiality. In much exulta∣tion
of mind, he dispatched a letter to
Madame du F—, containing this agree∣able
intelligence; but his letter was far
from producing in her mind the effect
he desired. A deep melancholy had seized
her thoughts, and her foreboding heart
refused to sympathize in his joy. Short,
indeed, was its duration. He had not
been many days at the chateau, when he
perceived, with surprize and consternation,
that his steps were continually watched
by two servants armed with fusees.</P>
<P>His father now shewed him an arret,
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
which, on the fourth of June, 1776, he had
obtained from the parliament of Rouen a∣gainst
his marriage. The Baron then or∣dered
his son to accompany him to his house
at Rouen, whither they went, attended by
several servants. That evening, when the
attendants withdrew after supper, the Ba∣ron,
entirely throwing off the mask of civi∣lity
and kindness, which he had worn in
such opposition to his nature, reproached
his son, in terms of the utmost bitterness,
for his past conduct, inveighed against his
marriage, and, after having exhausted
every expression of rage and resentment,
at length suffered him to retire to his own
apartment.</P>
<P>There the unhappy Mons. du F—,
absorbed in the most gloomy reflections,
lamented in vain that fatal credulity which
had led him to put himself into the power
of his implacable father. At the hour
of midnight his meditations were inter∣rupted
by the sound of feet approaching
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
his chamber; and in a few moments the
door was thrown open, and his father, at∣tended
by a servant armed, and two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Officers of justice.</NOTE> Ca∣valiers
de Marechaussée, entered the room.
Resistance and supplication were alike
unavailing. Mons. du F—'s papers
were seized; a few louis d'ors, which con∣stituted
all the money he possessed, were
taken from him; and he was conducted
in the dead of night, July the 7th, 1778,
to St. Yon, a convent used as a place of
confinement near Rouen, where he was
thrown into a dungeon.</P>
<P>A week after, his father entered the
dungeon. You will perhaps conclude that
his hard heart felt at length the relent∣ings
of a parent. You will at least sup∣pose,
that his imagination being haunted,
and his conscience tormented with the
image of a son stretched on the floor of
this subterraneous cell, he could sup∣port
the idea no longer, and had hastened
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
to give repose to his own mind by re∣leasing
his captive. Far different were
the motives of his visit. He considered
that such was his son's attachment to his
wife, that, so long as he believed he had
left her in possession of seven hundred
pounds, he would find comfort from that
consideration, even in the depth of his
dungeon. His father, therefore, hastened
to remove an error from the mind of his
son, which left the measure of his woes
unfilled. Nor did he chuse to yield to
another the office of inflicting a pang
sharper than captivity; but himself in∣formed
his son, that the merchant, who
was to pay the seven hundred pounds to
his wife, was declared a bankrupt.</P>
<P>A short time after, the Baron du F—commenced
a suit at law against that
agent of iniquity whom he had employed
to deceive his son, and who, practising a
refinement of treachery of which the
Baron was not aware, had kept the seven
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
hundred pounds, with which he was in∣trusted,
and given drafts upon a mer∣chant
who he knew would fail before the
time of payment. Not being able to
prosecute this affair without a power of
attorney from his son, the Baron applied
to him for that purpose. But Mons. du
F—, being firmly resolved not to de∣prive
his wife of the chance of recovering
the money for herself and her child, could
by no intreaties or menaces be led to com∣ply.
In vain his father, who had con∣sented
to allow him a few books, ordered
him to be deprived of that resource, and
that his confinement should be rendered
still more rigorous; he continued inflex∣ible.</P>
<P>Mons. du F—remained in his pri∣son
without meeting with the smallest
mark of sympathy from any one of his
family, though his second brother, Mons.
de B—, was now eighteen years of
age; an age at which the sordid conside∣rations
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
of interest, how much soever they
may affect our conduct at a more ad∣vanced
period of life, can seldom stifle
those warm and generous feelings which
seem to belong to youth. It might have
been expected that this young man would
have abhorred the prospect of possessing
a fortune which was the just inheritance of
his brother, and which could only be ob∣tained
by detaining that brother in per∣petual
captivity. Even admitting that
his inexorable father prohibited his visit∣ing
the prison of his brother, his heart
should have told him, that disobedience,
in this instance, would have been virtue:
Or, was it not sufficient to remain a passive
spectator of injustice, without becoming,
as he afterwards did, the agent of cruelty
inflicted on a brother?</P>
<P>Where are the words that can convey
an adequate idea of the sufferings of
Madame du F—during this period?
Three weeks after her husband's depar∣ture
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
from England, she heard the general
report of the town of Rouen, that the
Baron du F—had obtained a letter de
cachet against his son, and thrown him
into prison. This was all she heard of
her husband for the space of two years.
Ignorant of the place of his confinement,
uncertain if he still lived, perhaps her mi∣series
were even more poignant than his.
In the dismal solitude of a prison, his
pains were alleviated by the soothing re∣flection
that he suffered for her he loved;
while that very idea was to her the most
bitter aggravation of distress. Her days
passed in anguish, which can only be con∣ceived
where it has been felt, and her
nights were disturbed by the gloomy wan∣derings
of fancy. Sometimes she saw
him in her dreams chained to the floor of
his dungeon, his bosom bathed in blood,
and his countenance disfigured by death.
Sometimes she saw him hastening towards
her, when at the moment that he was
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
going to embrace her, they were fiercely
torn asunder. Madame du F—was
naturally of a delicate constitution, and
grief of mind reduced her to such a de∣plorable
state of weakness, that it was
with infinite difficulty she performed the
duties of her situation. For herself, she
would have welcomed death with thank∣fulness;
but she considered that her child
now depended entirely on her labours
for support: and this was a motive suf∣ficiently
powerful to prompt her to the
careful preservation of her own life, though
it had long become a burden. The child
was three years old when her father left
England; recollected him perfectly; and,
whenever her mother went to visit her,
used to call with eagerness for her papa.
The enquiry, in the voice of her child, of,
“When shall I see my dear, dear papa?”
was heard by this unhappy mother with
a degree of agony which it were vain in∣deed
to describe.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<P>MONS. du F—was repeatedly of∣fered
his liberty, but upon conditions
which he abhorred. He was required
for ever to renounce his wife; who, while
she remained with her child in a distant
country, was to receive from his father a
small pension, as an equivalent for the
pangs of disappointed affection, of dis∣grace
and dishonour. With the indigna∣tion
of offended virtue he spurned at these
insulting propositions, and endeavoured
to prepare his mind for the endurance of
perpetual captivity.</P>
<P>Nor can imagination form an idea of a
scene more dreadful than his prison, where
he perceived with horror that the great∣est
number of those prisoners who had
been many years in confinement, had an
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
appearance of frenzy in their looks, which
shewed that reason had been too weak for
the long struggle with calamity, and had
at last yielded to despair. In a cell ad∣joining
Mons. du F—'s, was an old man
who had been confined nearly forty years.
His grey beard hung down to his waist,
and, during the day, he was chained by his
neck to the wall. He was never allowed
to leave his cell, and never spoke; but
Mons. du F—used to hear the rattling
of his chains.</P>
<P>The prisoners, a few excepted, were
generally brought from their cells at
the hour of noon, and dined together.
But this gloomy repast was served in
uninterrupted silence. They were not
suffered to utter one word, and the pe∣nalty
of transgressing this rule was a rigo∣rous
confinement of several weeks. As
soon as this comfortless meal was finished,
the prisoners were instantly obliged to
return to their dungeons, in which they
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
were locked up till the same hour the
following day. Mons. du F—, in his
damp and melancholy cell, passed two
winters without fire, and suffered so se∣verely
from cold, that he was obliged to
wrap himself up in the few clothes which
covered his bed. Nor was he allowed
any light, except that which during the
short day beamed through the small
grated window in the cieling of his dun∣geon.</P>
<P>Is it not difficult to believe that these
sufferings were inflicted by a father?
A father!—that name which I
cannot trace without emotion; which
conveys all the ideas of protection, of
security, of tenderness;—that dear rela∣tion
to which, in general, children owe
their prosperity, their enjoyments, and
even their virtues!—Alas, the unhappy
Mons. du F—owed nothing to <HI>his</HI>
father, but that life, which from its earliest
period his cruelty had embittered, and
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
which he now condemned to languish in
miseries that death only could heal.</P>
<P>A young gentleman, who was confined
in a cell on one side of Mons. du F—'s,
contrived to make a small hole through
the wall; and these companions in mis∣fortune,
by placing themselves close to the
hole, could converse together in whispers.
But the Monks were not long in discover∣ing
this, and effectually deprived them of
so great an indulgence, by removing them
to distant cells. These unrelenting Monks,
who performed with such fidelity their
office of tormenting their fellow-crea∣tures,
who never relaxed in one article of
persecution, and adhered with scrupulous
rigour to the code of cruelty, were called,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Brothers of the holy Charity.</NOTE> “Les Freres de la sainte Charité.” One
among them deserved the appellation.
This good old Monk used to visit the pri∣soners
by stealth, and endeavour to ad∣minister
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
comfort to their affliction. Often
he repeated to Mons. du F—,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My dear brother, be comforted; place your confidence in God, your afflictions will have an end.</NOTE> “Mon
cher frere, consolez vous; mettez votre
confiance en Dieu, vos maux seront
finis!”</P>
<P>Mons. du F—remained two years
in prison without receiving any intelli∣gence
of his wife, on whose account he
suffered the most distracting anxiety. He
had reason to apprehend that her frame,
which had already been enfeebled by her
misfortunes, would sink beneath this ad∣ditional
load of misery, and that she would
perhaps be rendered unable to procure
that little pittance, which might preserve
herself and her child from want. At
length one of his fellow-prisoners, who
was going to regain his liberty, took charge
of a letter to Madame du F—, and
flattered him with the hope of finding
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
some means of transmitting to him an
answer.</P>
<P>The letter paints so naturally the situ∣ation
of his mind, that I have translated
some extracts from it.</P>
<P>“My thoughts (he says) are unceas∣ingly
occupied about you, and my
dear little girl. I am for ever recall∣ing
the blessed moments when I had
the happiness of being near you, and
at that recollection my tears refuse to
be controuled. How could I con∣sent
to separate myself from what was
most dear to me in the world? No
motive less powerful than that of seek∣ing
your welfare, and that of my child,
could have determined me—and alas!
I have not accomplished this end. I
know too well that you have never
received that sum of money which I
thought I had secured for you, and for
which I risked the first blessing of life.
What fills my mind with the greatest
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
horror, in the solitude of my prison, is
the fear that you are suffering difficul∣ties
in a foreign country. Here I re∣main
ignorant of your fate, and can
only offer to Heaven the most ardent
vows for your welfare.”</P>
<P>“What joy would a letter from you
give me! but I dare not flatter myself
with the hope of such sweet consola∣tion.
All I can assure myself of is,
that though separated, perhaps for ever,
our souls are united by the most ten∣der
friendship and attachment. Per∣haps
I may not find it possible to
write to you again for a long while:
but be assured that no meanaces, no suf∣ferings,
no dungeons shall ever shake
my fidelity to you, and that I shall love
you to the last hour of my existence.
I find a consolation in the reflection that
it is for you I suffer. If Providence
ever permits us to meet again, that
moment will efface the remembrance
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
of all my calamities. Live, my dear∣est
wife, in that hope. I conjure you
preserve your life for my sake, and for
the sake of our dear little girl! Em∣brace
her tenderly for me, and desire
her also to embrace you for her poor
papa. I need not recommend my
child to the care of so tender a mother;
but I conjure you to inspire her mind
with the deepest sense of religion. If
she is born to inherit the misfortunes
of her father, this will be her best
source of consolation.”</P>
<P>“Whatever offers may be made you
by my father, I exhort you never have
the weakness to listen to them, but
preserve your rights, and those of my
dear little girl, which, perhaps, may
one day be of some value. If you
are still at Mrs. D—'s boarding-school,
tell her that I recommend my
wife and child to her compassion.—But
what am I saying? I am ignorant
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
if you are still with her, ignorant whe∣ther
the dearest objects of my affection
still live! But I trust that Providence
has preserved you. Adieu! May God
Almighty bless you, and my child! I
never cease imploring him to have pity
on the widow and the orphan in a land
of strangers.”</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<P>YOU, my dear friend, who have felt
the tender attachments of love and friend∣ship,
and the painful anxieties which ab∣sence
occasions, even amidst scenes of
variety and pleasure; who understand the
value at which tidings from those we love
is computed in the arithmetic of the
heart; who have heard with almost un∣controulable
emotion the postman's rap
at the door; have trembling seen the
well-known hand which excited sensa∣tions
that almost deprived you of power
to break the seal which seemed the ta∣lisman
of happiness: you can judge of
the feelings of Mons. Du F—when
he received, by means of the same friend
who had conveyed his letter, an answer
from his wife. But the person who
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
brought the letter to his dungeon, dread∣ing
the risk of a discovery, insisted, that
after having read it, he should return it
to him immediately. Mons. Du F—pressed
the letter to his heart, bathed it
with his tears, and implored the indul∣gence
of keeping it at least till the next
morning. He was allowed to do so, and
read it till every word was imprinted on
his memory; and, after enjoying the sad
luxury of holding it that night on his bo∣som,
was forced the next morning to re∣linquish
his treasure.</P>
<P>On the 10th of October, 1780, the
Baron Du F—came to the convent,
and ordered the monks to bring his son
from his dungeon to the parloir, and
leave them together. With the utmost
reluctance Mons. Du F—obeyed this
summons, having long lost all hope of
softening the obdurate heart of his father.
When the monks withdrew, the Baron
began upbraiding him in the most bitter
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
terms, for his obstinate resistance to his
will, which, he informed him, had availed
nothing, as he had gained his suit at law,
and recovered the seven hundred pounds.
Mons. Du F—replied, that the pain
he felt from this intelligence would have
been far more acute, had his wife been
deprived, with his concurrence, of the
money which was promised for her sub∣sistence,
and on the reliance of which pro∣mise
he had been tempted to leave Eng∣land.
His father then enquired if he
still persisted in his adherence to the dis∣graceful
connection he had formed; to
which his son answered, that not merely
were his affections interested, but that his
honour obliged him to maintain, with in∣violable
fidelity, a solemn and sacred en∣gagement.
The rage of the Baron, at
these words, became unbounded. He
stamped the ground with his feet; he
aimed a stroke at his son, who, taking
advantage of this moment of frenzy, de∣termined
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
to attempt his escape; and, rush∣ing
out of the apartment, and avoiding
that side of the convent which the monks
inhabited, he endeavoured to find his way
to the garden, but missed the passage
which led to it. He then flew up a stair∣case,
from which he heard the voice of
his father calling for assistance. Finding
that all the doors which he passed were
shut, he continued ascending till he reach∣ed
the top of the building, where meet∣ing
with no other opening than a hole
made in the sloping roof to let in light
to a garret, he climbed up with much
difficulty, and then putting his feet through
the hole, and letting his body out by de∣grees,
he supported himself for a moment
on the roof, and deliberated on what he
was about to do. But his mind was, at
this crisis, wrought up to a pitch of des∣peration,
which mocked the suggestions
of fear. He quitted his hold, and, fling∣ing
himself from a height of nearly fifty
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
feet, became insensible before he reached
the ground, where he lay weltering in his
blood, and to all appearance dead.</P>
<P>He had fallen on the high road lead∣ing
from Rouen to Caen. Some people
who were passing gathered round him,
and one person having washed the blood
from his face, instantly recognized his
features, and exclaimed to the astonished
croud, that he was the eldest son of the
Baron Du F—. Upon examining his
body, it was found that he had broken his
arm, his thigh, his ancle-bone, and his
heel, besides having received many vio∣lent
bruises. He still remained in a state
of insensibility; and, while these charita∣ble
strangers were using their efforts to
restore him to life, the monks hastened
from their convent, snatched their victim
from those good Samaritans who would
have poured oil and wine into his wounds,
and carried him to the infirmary of the
convent, where he remained some weeks
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
before he recovered his senses; after
which he lay stretched upon a bed for
three months, suffering agonies of pain.</P>
<P>His father, who had been the jailor,
and almost the murderer of his son, heard
of these sufferings without remorse, nor
did he ever see him more. But, though
he was sufficiently obdurate to bear un∣moved
the calamities he had inflicted on
his child, though he could check the up∣braidings
of his own conscience, he could
not silence the voice of public indigna∣tion.
The report that Mons. Du F—had
been found lying on the road bathed
in blood, and had in that condition been
dragged to the prison of St. Yon, was
soon spread through the town of Rouen.
Every one sympathized in the fate of this
unfortunate young man, and execrated
the tyranny of his unrelenting father.</P>
<P>The universal clamour reached the ear
of his brother, Mons. De B—, who
now, for the first time, out of respect to
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
the public opinion, took a measure which
his heart had never dictated during the
long captivity of his brother, that of vi∣siting
him in prison. Mons. de. B—'s
design in these visits was merely to appease
the public; for small indeed was the con∣solation
they afforded to his brother. He
did not come to bathe with his tears the
bed where that unhappy young man lay
stretched in pain and anguish; to lament
the severity of his father; to offer him
all the consolation of fraternal tender∣ness;—he
came to warn him against in∣dulging
a hope of ever regaining his li∣berty—he
came to pierce his soul with
“hard unkindness' altered eye, which
mocks the tear it forc'd to flow!”</P>
<P>I will not attempt to describe the
wretchedness of Madame du F—,
when she heard the report of her hus∣band's
situation. Your heart will con∣ceive
what she suffered far better than I
can relate it. Three months after his
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
fall, Mons. du F—contrived, through
the assistance of the charitable old monk,
to send her a few lines written with his
left hand. “My fall” (he says) “has
made my captivity known, and has led
the whole town of Rouen to take an
interest in my misfortunes. Perhaps I
shall have reason to bless the accident,
which may possibly prove the means of
procuring me my liberty, and uniting
me again to you!—In the mean time,
I trust that Providence will watch with
paternal goodness over the two objects
of my most tender affection. Do not,
my dearest wife, suffer the thoughts of
my situation to prey too much upon
your mind. My arm is almost well:
my thigh and foot are not quite cured;
but I am getting better.”</P>
<P>“I could not suppress my tears on read∣ing
that part of your letter, wherein you
tell me that my dear little girl often
asks for her papa.—Kiss her for me a
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
thousand times, and tell her that her
papa is always thinking of her and her
dear mama. I am well convinced that
you will give her the best education
your little pittance can afford. But
above all, I beseech you, inspire her
young mind with sentiments of piety:
teach her to love her Creator: that is
the most essential of all lessons. Adieu,
dearest and most beloved of women!—Is
there a period in reserve when we
shall meet again? Oh how amply will
that moment compensate for all our
misfortunes!”</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>AT length the Parliament of Rouen
began to interest itself in the cause of
Mons. du F—. The circumstances
of his confinement were mentioned in that
Assembly, and the President sent his Se∣cretary
to Mons. du F—'s prison, who
had now quitted his bed, and was able to
walk with the assistance of crutches. By
the advice of the President, Mons. du
F—addressed some letters to the Par∣liament,
representing his situation in the
most pathetic terms, and imploring their
interference in his behalf.</P>
<P>It is here necessary to mention, that
Mons. de Bel B—, Procureur Gene∣ral
de Rouen, being intimately connected
with the Baron du F—'s family, had
ventured to demonstrate his friendship for
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
the Baron, by confining his son nearly
three years on his own authority, and
without any lettre de cachet. And, though
Mons. de Bel B—well knew, that
every species of oppression was connived
at, under the shelter of lettres de cachet,
he was sensible that it was only beneath
their auspices that the exercise of tyranny
was permitted; and in this particular in∣stance,
not having been cruel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to rules.</NOTE> selon les
regles, he apprehended, that if ever Mons.
du F—regained his liberty, he might
be made responsible for his conduct. He,
therefore, exerted all his influence, and
with too much success, to frustrate the be∣nevolent
intention of the President of the
Parliament, respecting Mons. du F—.
His letters were indeed read in that As∣sembly,
and ordered to be registered,
where they still remain a record of the pu∣sillanimity
of those men, who suffered the
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
authority of Mons. de Bel B—to
overcome the voice of humanity; who
acknowledged the atrocity of the Baron
du F—'s conduct, and yet were deaf
to the supplications of his son, while,
from the depth of his dungeon, he called
upon them for protection and redress.</P>
<P>May the fate of the captive, in the land
of France, no more hang suspended on
the frail thread of the pity, or the caprice
of individuals! May justice erect, on eter∣nal
foundations, her protecting sanctuary
for the oppressed; and may humanity
and mercy be the graceful decorations of
her temple!</P>
<P>The Baron du F—perceived that,
notwithstanding his machinations had pre∣vented
the Parliament of Rouen from
taking any effectual measures towards li∣berating
his son, it would be impossible
to silence the murmurs of the public,
while he remained confined at St. Yon.
He determined, therefore, to remove him
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
to some distant prison, where his name
and family were unknown; and where,
beyond the jurisdiction of the Parliament
of Rouen, his groans might rise unpitied
and unavenged. But the Baron, not
daring, amidst the general clamour, to re∣move
his son by force, endeavoured to
draw him artfully into the snare he had
prepared.</P>
<P>Mons. de B—was sent to his bro∣ther's
prison, where he represented to him,
that, though he must not indulge the least
hope of ever regaining his liberty, yet, if
he would write a letter to Mons. M—,
keeper of the seals, desiring to be removed
to some other place, his confinement should
be made far less rigorous. Mons. du
F—was now in a state of desperation,
that rendered him almost careless of his
fate. He perceived that the Parliament
had renounced his cause. He saw no pos∣sibility
of escape from St. Yon; and flat∣tered
himself, that in a place where he was
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
less closely confined, it might perhaps be
practicable; and therefore he consented
to write the letter required, which Mons.
de B—conveyed in triumph to his
father. There were, however, some ex∣pressions
in the letter which the Baron
disapproved, on which account he returned
it, desiring that those expressions might be
changed. But, during the interval of his
brother's absence, Mons. du F—had
reflected on the rash imprudence of con∣fiding
in the promises of those by whom
he had been so cruelly deceived. No
sooner, therefore, did Mons. de B—put
the letter again into his hands, than
he tore it into pieces, and peremptorily
refused to write another.</P>
<P>Soon after this, Mons. du B—, the
ambassador of the tyrant, again returned
to his brother with fresh credentials, and
declared to him, that if he would write
to the keeper of the seals, desiring to be
removed from St. Yon, he should, in one
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
fortnight after his removal, be restored to
liberty. Upon Mons. du F—'s as∣serting
that he could no longer confide in
the promises made him by his family, his
brother, in a formal written engagement,
to which he signed his name, gave him
the most solemn assurance, that this pro∣mise
should be fulfilled with fidelity.
Mons. du F—desired a few days for
deliberation, and, during that interval,
found means of consulting a magistrate
of Rouen who was his friend, and who
advised him to comply with the terms
that were offered, after having caused se∣veral
copies of the written engagement
to be taken, and certified by such of the
prisoners at St. Yon as were likely to re∣gain
their freedom; a precaution neces∣sary,
lest his own copy should be torn
from his hands.</P>
<P>Thus, having neither trusted to the af∣fection,
the mercy, or the remorse of those
within whose bosoms such sentiments were
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
extinguished; having bargained, by a
written agreement, with a father and a
brother, for his release from the horrors
of perpetual captivity, Mons. du F—wrote
the letter required.</P>
<P>Soon after, an order was sent from
Versailles for his release from the prison
of St. Yon, and with it a lettre de cachet,
whereby he was exiled to Beauvais, with
a command not to leave that town. Mons.
de B—, acting as a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An officer of justice.</NOTE> Cavalier de la
Marechaussée, conducted his brother to
this place of exile, and there left him.
A short time after, Mons. du F—re∣ceived
an intimation, from that magi∣strate
of Rouen who had interested him∣self
in his misfortunes, that his father was
on the point of obtaining another lettre
de cachet, to remove him from Beauvais,
to some prison in the south of France,
where he might never more be heard of.
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
This gentleman added, that Mons. du
F—had not one moment to lose, and
advised him immediately to attempt his
escape.</P>
<P>Early on the morning after he receiv∣ed
this intelligence, Mons. du F—,
who had the liberty to walk about the
town, fled from Beauvais. The person
who brought him the letter from the ma∣gistrate,
waited for him at a little distance
from the town, and accompanied him on
his journey. When they reached Lisle
in Flanders, not having a passport, they
were obliged to wait from eleven o'clock
at night till ten the next morning, before
they could obtain permission from the
Governor to proceed on their journey.
Mons. du F—concluded that he was
pursued, and suffered the most dreadful
apprehensions of being overtaken. His
companion, with some address, at length
obtained a passport, and attended him as
far as Ostend. The wind proving con∣trary,
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
he was detained two days in a state
of the most distracting inquietude, and
concealed himself on board the vessel in
which he had taken his passage for Eng∣land.
At length the wind became fa∣vourable;
the vessel sailed, and arrived
late in the night at Margate. Mons. du
F—, when he reached the English
shore, knelt down, and, in a transport of
joy, kissed the earth of that dear country
which had twice proved his asylum.</P>
<P>He then enquired when the stage-coach
set off for London, and was told that it
went at so early an hour the next morn∣ing,
that he could not go till the day af∣ter,
as he must wait till his portmanteau
was examined by the custom-house offi∣cers,
who were now in bed. The delay
of a few hours in seeing his wife and child,
after such an absence, after such suffer∣ings,
was not to be endured. In a vio∣lent
agitation of mind, he snatched up his
portmanteau, and was going to fling it
<PB N="181" REF="183"/>
into the sea, when he was prevented by
the people near him, who said, that if he
would pay the fees, his portmanteau
should be sent after him. He eagerly
complied with their demands, and set out
for London. As he drew near, his anx∣iety,
his impatience, his emotion increased.
His present situation appeared to him like
one of those delicious dreams, which
sometimes visited the darkness of his dun∣geon,
and for a while restored him, in
imagination, to those he loved. Scarcely
could he persuade himself that he was
beyond the reach of oppression; that he
was in a land of freedom; that he was
hastening every moment towards his wife
and child. When he entered London,
his sensations became almost too strong to
bear. He was in the very same place
which his wife and child inhabited—but
were they yet alive? were they in health?
had Heaven indeed reserved for him the
transport of holding them once more to
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
his bosom, of mixing his tears with theirs?
When he knocked at the door of the
house where he expected to hear of Ma∣dame
du F—, he had scarcely power
to articulate his enquiries after her and his
child. He was told that they were in
health, but that Madame du F—, be∣ing
in a situation six miles from London,
he could not see her till the next morn∣ing.
Mons. du F—had not been in
a bed for several nights, and was almost
overcome with agitation and fatigue. He,
however, instantly set out on foot for the
habitation of his wife, announced himself
to the mistress of the family, and remain∣ed
in another apartment, while she, after
making Madame du F—promise that
she would listen to her with calmness, told
her, that there was a probability of her
husband's return to England. He heard
the sobs, the exclamations, of his wife at
this intelligence—he could restrain no
longer—he rushed into the room—he
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
flew into her arms—he continued pres∣sing
her in silence to his bosom. She
was unable to shed a tear; and it was
not till after he had long endeavoured to
sooth her by his tenderness, and had talked
to her of her child, that she obtained re∣lief
from weeping. She then, with the
most violent emotion, again and again re∣peated
the same enquiries, and was a con∣siderable
time before she recovered any
degree of composure.</P>
<P>All the fortune Mons. du F—pos∣sessed
when he reached London, was one
half guinea; but his wife had, during his
absence, saved ten guineas out of her lit∣tle
salary. You will easily imagine how
valuable this hoard became in her estima∣tion,
when she could apply it to the pre∣cious
use of relieving the necessities of her
husband. Mons. Du F—went to
London the next day, and hired a little
garret: there, with a few books, a rush∣light,
and some straw in which he wrap∣ped
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
his legs to supply the want of fire,
he recollected not the splendour to which
he had once been accustomed, but the
dungeon from which he had escaped. He
saw his wife and child once a week; and,
in those solitary moments, when books
failed to sooth his thoughts, he anticipa∣ted
the hour in which he should again
meet the objects most dear to his heart,
and passed the intervals of time in philo∣sophic
resignation. His clothes being too
shabby to admit of his appearing in the
day, he issued from his little shed when it
was dark, and endeavoured to warm him∣self
by the exercise of walking.</P>
<P>Unfortunately he caught the small-pox,
and his disorder rose to such a height,
that his life was despaired of. In his de∣lirium,
he used to recapitulate the sad
story of his misfortunes; and when he saw
any person near his bed-side, would call
out, with the utmost vehemence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Make all the French go out.</NOTE> “Qu'on
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
fasse sortir touts les François!” After
having been for some days in the most
imminent danger, Mons. du F—re∣covered
from this disease.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>SIX months after Mons. du F—'s
return to England, his family found them∣selves
compelled to silence the public cla∣mours,
by allowing him a small annual
pension. Upon this, Madame du F—quitted
her place, and came to live with
her husband and her child in an obscure
lodging. Their little income received
some addition by means of teaching the
French language in a few private families.</P>
<P>A young lady, who came to pay me a
visit at London in 1785, desired to take
some lessons in French, and Madame du
<PB N="186" REF="188"/>
F—was recommended to us for that
purpose. We soon perceived in her con∣versation
every mark of a cultivated mind,
and of an amiable disposition. She at
length told us the history of her misfortunes,
with the pathetic eloquence of her own
charming language; and, after having heard
that recital, it required but common hu∣manity,
to treat her with the respect due
to the unhappy, and to feel for her sorrows
that sympathy to which they had such
claim. How much has the sensibility of
Mons. and Madame du F—over-rated
those proofs of esteem and friendship
which we were enabled to shew them in
their adversity!—But I must not antici∣pate.</P>
<P>On the seventh of October, 1787, the
Baron died, leaving, besides Mons. du
F—, two other sons, and a daughter.</P>
<P>I must here mention, that at the time
when Mons. du F—was confined to
his bed in the prison of St. Yon, from the
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
consequences of his fall, his father, in
order to avoid the clamours at Rouen,
went for some weeks to Paris. He there
made a will, disinheriting his eldest son.
By the old laws of France, however, a
father could not punish his son more than
once for the same offence. Nor was there
any thing in so mild a clause that could
much encourage disobedience; since this
single punishment, of which the mercy
of the law was careful to avoid repetition,
might be extended to residence for life in
a dungeon. Such was evidently the in∣tention
of the Baron du F—: and,
though his son, disappointing this intention,
had escaped with only three years of cap∣tivity,
and some broken limbs, the benig∣nant
law above-mentioned interposed to
prevent farther punishment, and left the
Baron without any legal right to deprive
Mons. du F—of his inheritance. His
brothers, being sensible of this, wrote to
inform him of his father's death, and recal
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
him to France. He refused to go while
the lettre de cachet remained in force
against him. The Baron having left all
his papers sealed up, which his younger
sons could not open but in the presence of
their brother, they obtained the revocation
of the lettre de cachet, and sent it to
Mons. du F—, who immediately set
off for France.</P>
<P>The Baron's estate amounted to about
four thousand pounds a year. Willing
to avoid a tedious litigation with his bro∣thers,
Mons. du F—consented to di∣vide
with them this property. But he
soon found reason to repent of his impru∣dent
generosity; those very brothers, on
whom he had bestowed an equal share of
his fortune, refusing to concur with him
in his application to the parliament of
Rouen for the revocation of the arret
against his marriage▪ Mons. du F—,
surprised and shocked at their refusal,
began to entertain some apprehensions of
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
his personal safety; and dreading that,
supported by the authority of his mother,
another lettre de cachet might be ob∣tained
against him, he hastened back to
England. Nor was it till after he had re∣ceived
assurances from several of the ma∣gistrates
of Rouen, that they would be
responsible for the safety of his person,
that he again ventured to return to France,
accompanied by Madame and Mademoi∣selle
du F—, in order to obtain the re∣vocation
of the arret. On their arrival at
Rouen, finding that the parliament was
exiled, and that the business could not be
prosecuted at that time, they again came
back to pass the winter in England.</P>
<P>At this period his mother died; and in
the following summer Mons. and Ma∣dame
du F—arrived in France, at the
great epocha of French liberty, on the
15th of July, 1789, the very day after
that on which the Bastille was taken. It
was then that Mons. du F—felt him∣self
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
in security on his native shore.—It was
then that his domestic comforts were no
longer embittered with the dread of being
torn from his family by a separation more
terrible than death itself.—It was then that
he no more feared that his repose at night
would be broken by the entrance of ruf∣fians
prepared to drag him to dungeons,
the darkness of which was never visited
by the blessed beams of day!</P>
<P>He immediately took possession of his
chateau, and only waits for the appoint∣ment
of the new judges, to solicit the re∣vocation
of the arret against his marriage,
and to secure the inheritance of his estate
to Mademoiselle du F—, his only
daughter, who is now fifteen years of age,
and is that very child who was born in
the bosom of adversity, and whose infancy
was exposed to all the miseries of want.
May she never know the afflictions of her
parents, but may she inherit their virtues!</P>
<P>Under the antient government of France,
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
there might have been some doubt of
Mons. du F—'s obtaining the revoca∣tion
of the arret against his marriage. Be∣neath
the iron hand of despotism, justice and
virtue might have been overthrown. But
happier omens belong to the new consti∣tution
of France. The judges will com∣mence
their high office with that dignity
becoming so important a trust, by can∣celling
an act of the most flagrant op∣pression.
They will confirm that solemn,
that sacred engagement which Mons. and
Madame du F—have three times
vowed at the altar of God!—which has
been sanctioned by laws human and di∣vine—which
has been ratified in earth
and in heaven!</P>
<P>No sooner had Mons. and Madame du
F—taken possession of their property,
than they seemed eager to convince us,
how little this change of fortune was ca∣pable
of obliterating, for one moment, the
remembrance of the friends of their ad∣versity.
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
With all the earnestness of affec∣tion,
they invited us to France, and ap∣peared
to think their prosperity incom∣plete,
and their happiness imperfect, till
we accepted the invitation. You will
believe that we are not insensible wit∣nesses
of the delightful change in their
fortune. We have the joy of seeing them,
not only possessing all the comforts of af∣fluence,
but universal respect and esteem.</P>
<P>Mons. du F—endeavours to banish
misery from his possessions. His tenants
consider him as a father, and, “when
the eye sees him it blesses him.” I said
to one of the peasants whom I met in
my walk yesterday,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am happy to see that Monsieur is so much beloved.—Oh, yes, Madam, and well he may, he does us nothing but good.</NOTE> “Je suis charmée
de voir que Mons. est si bien aimez ici.”
—“Oh pour ça, oui Madame, et à bonne
raison, car il ne nous fait que du bien!”</P>
<P>Such is the history of Mons. du F—.
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
Has it not the air of a romance? and are
you not glad that the denouement is hap∣py?—Does
not the old Baron die exact∣ly
in the right place; at the very page
one would chuse?—Or, if I sometimes
wish that he had lived a little longer, it is
only from that desire of retribution, which,
in cases of injustice and oppression, it is
so natural to feel.—It is only because the
knowledge of the overthrow of the an∣tient
government would have been a suf∣ficient
punishment to him for all his cru∣elty.
He would have sickened at the
sight of general happiness. The idea of
liberty being extended to the lower ranks,
while, at the same time, tyranny was de∣prived
of its privileges, he would have
found insupportable; and would have ab∣horred
a country, which could no longer
boast of a Bastille; a country where iron
cages were broken down, where dungeons
were thrown open, and where justice was
henceforth to shed a clear and steady light,
<PB N="194" REF="196"/>
without one dark shade of relief from let∣tres
de cachet.</P>
<P>But peace be to his ashes! If the re∣collection
of his evil deeds excites my
indignation, it is far otherwise with Mons.
and Madame du F—. Never did I
hear their lips utter an expression of re∣sentment,
or disrespect, towards his me∣mory;
and never did I, with that warmth
which belongs to my friendship for them,
involuntarily pass a censure on his con∣duct,
without being made sensible, by
their behaviour, that I had done wrong.</P>

<P>I Am glad you think that a friend's ha∣ving
been persecuted, imprisoned, mai∣med,
and almost murdered under the an∣tient
government of France, is a good
excuse for loving the revolution. What,
indeed, but friendship, could have led my
attention from the annals of imagination
to the records of politics; from the poe∣try
to the prose of human life? In vain
might Aristocrates have explained to me
the rights of kings, and Democrates have
descanted on the rights of the people.
How many fine-spun threads of reasoning
would my wandering thoughts have bro∣ken;
and how difficult should I have
found it to arrange arguments and infe∣rences
in the cells of my brain! But
however dull the faculties of my head,
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
I can assure you, that when a proposition
is addressed to my heart, I have some
quickness of perception. I can then de∣cide,
in one moment, points upon which
philosophers and legislators have differed
in all ages: nor could I be more convinced
of the truth of any demonstration in Euclid,
than I am, that, that system of politics
must be the best, by which those I love
are made happy.</P>
<P>Mons. du F—'s chateau is near the
little town of Forges, celebrated for its
mineral waters, and much resorted to in
summer on that account. We went to
the fountain on pretence of drinking the
waters, but in reality to see the com∣pany.
The first morning we made our
appearance, the ladies presented us with
nosegays of fine spreading purple heath,
which they called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nosegays of the fountain.</NOTE> Bouquets à la fon∣taine.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199"/>
I was told, before I left England, that I
should find that French liberty had destroy∣ed
French urbanity. But everything I have
seen and heard, since my arrival in France,
has contradicted this assertion, and led
me to believe that the French will care∣fully
preserve, from the wreck of their mo∣narchical
government, the old charter they
have so long held of superiority in po∣liteness.
I am persuaded the most deter∣mined
Democrates of the nation, what∣ever
other privileges they may chuse to
exercise, will always suffer the privilege
of being rude to lie dormant.</P>
<P>In every country it is social pleasure
that sheds the most delicious flowers which
grow on the path of life; but in France
she covers the whole way with roses, and
the traveller can scarcely mark its rug∣gedness.
Happy are a people, so fond of
talking as the French, in possessing a lan∣guage
modelled to all the charming pur∣poses
of conversation. Their turn of ex∣pression
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
is a dress that hangs so gracefully
on gay ideas, that you are apt to suppose
that wit, a quality parsimoniously distribut∣ed
in other countries, is in France as com∣mon
as the gift of speech. Perhaps that
brilliant phraseology, which dazzles a fo∣reigner,
may be familiar and common to
a French ear: but how much ingenuity
must we allow to a people, who have form∣ed
a language, of which the common-place
phrases give you the idea of wit!</P>
<P>You, who are a reader of Madame Bru∣lart's
works, will know, that I am here on
a sort of classic ground. The Abbaye
de Bobec is but a few miles distant from
this chateau, and I walk every day in the
forest where Michel and Jaqueline erected
their little hut; which you may remember,
having unfortunately built too low to ad∣mit
of their standing upright, they com∣forted
themselves with the reflection,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One cannot think of every thing.</NOTE> “Qu'on ne peut pas penser à tout;” and,
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
when they were once seated in their dwell∣ing,
in which it was a vain attempt to
stand, expatiated on the comforts of being
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At home.</NOTE> “chez soi.” Upon enquiry, I have
heard that poor Jaqueline, three years after
the happy change in her fortune, was killed
by a stroke of lightning, and that Michel
(as he was bound to do, being the hero of
a romance) died of grief.</P>
<P>The Abbé de Bobec has much reputa∣tion
in this part of the country for wis∣dom;
but a French gentleman, who dined
with him yesterday, told me this morn∣ing,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He gave me an indigestion of good sense.</NOTE> “Il m'a donné une indigestion de

<P>She then placed the crown of flowers
upon his head, and he embraced her ten∣derly.
A number of ladies advanced,
presented him with nosegays, and were
embraced in their turn.</P>
<P>We had seen, while we were at Paris,
a charming little piece performed at the
Theatre de Monsieur, called, “La Fede∣ration,

piece, and it was now performed by the
company assembled at the chateau. The
tenants, with their wives and daughters,
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
formed the most considerable part of the
audience, and I believe no play, in antient
or modern times, was ever acted with
more applause. My sister took a part in
the performance, which I declined doing,
till I recollected that one of the principal
characters was a statue; upon which, I
consented to perform<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fine part of the statue.</NOTE> le beau role de

was inscribed, in transparent letters,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To Liberty, July 14th, 1789.</NOTE> “A

with fillets and scarfs of national ribband;
connect it with the sound of the viol and
the harp, and appoint it not merely to re∣gulate

Apropos of poets.—The French have
conquered many old prejudices, but their
prejudice against Shakespeare still exists.
They well know, that though in England
it is our policy, or our pleasure, to have
an opposition on every other subject, we
have not one dissenting voice about
Shakespeare; and therefore they allow
that he may, perhaps, deserve to be the
idol of the British nation, a sort of house∣hold
god whom we delight to honour;
but they have gods of their own to whom
they pay homage, and have little idea that
Shakespeare was not only the glory of
England, but of human nature. It would
be a hopeless attempt to convince them,
that the genius of their boasted Corneille
has something of the proud and affected
greatness of Lewis the Fourteenth, while
that of Shakespeare has more affinity to
the noble dignified simplicity of Henry
the Fourth. They repeat, till you are
weary of the remark, that French trage∣dies
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
are regular dramas, while Shake∣speare's
plays are monsters. This re∣minds
me of Boileau's answer to an au∣thor
who had brought him a play to read,
of which Boileau disapproved. Sir, ex∣claimed
the enraged author, I defy malice
to say that my piece transgresses any one
of the rules. “Why, Sir,” replied Boi∣leau,
“it transgresses the first rule of all,
that of keeping the reader awake.”</P>
<P>The young gentleman who, as I men∣tioned
to you, was confined at St. Yon,
in the cell adjoining Mons. du F—'s,
and with whom he used to converse in
whispers through a hole in the wall, is
come to pay a visit at the chateau. This
young man went very early into the ar∣my:
but, at the age of twenty, his father
being at St. Domingo, and his mother
considering her son as a spy upon her
conduct, which was such as shrunk from
inspection, obtained a lettre de cachet
against him, and he was confined three
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
years at St. Yon. He has told me, that,
after the first year, he lost all hope of
ever regaining his liberty. A morbid
melancholy seized his mind; he lay stretch∣ed
on the same bed for two years; and
sometimes refused to taste food for seve∣ral
days together. When his father, at
his return from St. Domingo, came to
liberate him, he was so feeble that he was
unable to walk.</P>
<P>His father again left France, and the
brother of this young man has suffered a
fate even more severe than himself. At
the age of fifteen, he was guilty of some
indiscretions, which incurred the resent∣ment
of his unrelenting mother, and ano∣ther
lettre de cachet was obtained.—
“Is there any cause in nature that makes
these hard hearts?”—He was confined
ten years, and only released when all the
prisons were thrown open, by order of the
National Assembly. But for this un∣happy
young man their mercy came too
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
late—His reason was gone forever! and
he was led out of his prison, at the age
of five and twenty, a maniac. When
the sensibility with which his brother re∣lates
these family misfortunes melts us
into tears, we are told,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melancholy is the disease of English coal fires.</NOTE> que la tristesse,
est la maladie du charbon Anglois, and
will never be tolerated in France.</P>
<P>You will not be surprized to hear that
Mons. du F—has, with great com∣placency,
relinquished his title; and that,
being a ci-devant <HI>captive,</HI> as well as a ci∣devant
<HI>Baron,</HI> he feels that the enjoyment
of personal security, the sweetness of do∣mestic
comfort, in short, that the com∣mon
rights of man are of more value than
he ever found the rights of nobility in the
solitude of his dungeon. He is ready to
acknowledge, that confinement in a sub∣terraneous
cell, a fall from a height of
fifty feet, and the fracture of his limbs,
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
are things which even the title of Baron
can scarcely counterbalance; and he there∣fore
drinks a libation, every day after din∣ner,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the health of the National Assembly.</NOTE> à la sante de l'Assemblée Nation∣ale,
though they have deprived him of
the soothing epithet of Mon-Seigneur.
We, however, shall soon cease to pledge
him in this toast. The day of our depar∣ture
draws near. We must leave the
charming society at the chateau—we must
leave the peasants dance under the shade
of the old elms, while the setting sun
pours streams of liquid gold through the
foliage—we must leave<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The player on the violin, who, with his misera∣ble figure, has become wrinkled from laughing.</NOTE> Le maitre de
violon, qui se ride en riant, avec sa
malheureuse figure.—All this must we
leave!—To-morrow is the last day of
our residence at the chateau. What a de∣solate
word is that monosyllable of <HI>last</HI>—
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
how sad, how emphatical its meaning!—
There is something in it which gives the
most indifferent things an interest in our
affections.—I am sure I could write a vo∣lume
with this little word for my text;
but I may as well explain myself in one
line—I am sorry to leave France!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>London.</OPENER>
<P>WE left France early in September,
that we might avoid the equinoctial gales;
but were so unfortunate as to meet, in our
passage from Dieppe to Brighton, with a
very violent storm. We were two days
and two nights at sea, and beat four and
twenty hours off the coast of Brighton;
and it would be difficult for you, who
have formed your calculations of time
on dry land, to guess what is the length
of four and twenty hours in a storm at
sea. At last, with great difficulty, we
landed on the beach, where we found se∣veral
of our friends and acquaintance,
who, supposing that we might be among
the passengers, sympathised with our dan∣ger,
and were anxious for our preservation.</P>
<P>Before the storm became so serious as
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
to exclude every idea but that of prepar∣ing
to die with composure, I could not
help being diverted with the comments
on French customs, and French politics,
which passed in the cabin. “Ah,” says
one man to his companion, “one had
need to go to France, to know how to
like old England when one gets back
again.”—“For my part,” rejoined ano∣ther,
“I've never been able to get drunk
once the whole time I was in France—
not a drop of porter to be had—and as
for their victuals, they call a bit of meat
of a pound and a half, a fine piece of
roast beef.”—“And pray,” added he,
turning to one of the sailors, “What do
you think of their National Assembly?”—
“Why,” says the sailor, “if I ben't mis∣taken,
the National Assembly has got
some points from the wind.”</P>
<P>I own it has surprized me not a little,
since I came to London, to find that most
of my acquaintance are of the same opi∣nion
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
with the sailor. Every visitor brings
me intelligence from France full of dis∣may
and horror. I hear of nothing but
crimes, assassinations, torture, and death.
I am told that every day witnesses a con∣spiracy;
that every town is the scene of
a massacre; that every street is blackened
with a gallows, and every highway deluged
with blood. I hear these things, and re∣peat
to myself, Is this the picture of
France? Are these the images of that
universal joy, which called tears into my
eyes, and made my heart throb with sym∣pathy?—To
me, the land which these
mighty magicians have suddenly covered
with darkness, where, waving their evil
wand, they have reared the dismal scaffold,
have clotted the knife of the assassin with
gore, have called forth the shriek of des∣pair,
and the agony of torture; to me,
this land of desolation appeared drest in
additional beauty beneath the genial smile
of liberty. The woods seemed to cast a
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
more refreshing shade, and the lawns to
wear a brighter verdure, while the carols
of freedom burst from the cottage of the
peasant, and the voice of joy resounded
on the hill, and in the valley.</P>
<P>Must I be told that my mind is per∣verted,
that I am become dead to all sen∣sations
of sympathy, because I do not weep
with those who have lost a part of their
superfluities, rather than rejoice that the op∣pressed
are protected, that the wronged are
redressed, that the captive is set at liber∣ty,
and that the poor have bread? Did
the universal parent of the human race,
implant the feelings of pity in the heart,
that they should be confined to the artifi∣cial
wants of vanity, the ideal deprivations
of greatness; that they should be fixed
beneath the dome of the palace, or locked
within the gate of the chateau; without
extending one commiserating sigh to the
wretched hamlet, as if its famished inha∣bitants,
though not ennobled by <HI>man,</HI> did
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
not bear, at least, the ensigns of nobility
stamped on our nature by God?</P>
<P>Must I hear the charming societies, in
which I found all the elegant graces of
the most polished manners, all the amiable
urbanity of liberal and cultivated minds,
compared with the most rude, ferocious,
and barbarous levellers that ever existed?
Really, some of my English acquaint∣ance,
whatever objections they may have
to republican principles, do, in their dis∣cussions
of French politics, adopt a most
free and republican style of censure. No∣thing
can be more democratical than their
mode of expression, or display a more le∣velling
spirit, than their unqualified con∣tempt
of <HI>all</HI> the leaders of the revolu∣tion.</P>
<P>It is not my intention to shiver lances,
in every society I enter, in the cause of the
National Assembly. Yet I cannot help
remarking, that, since that Assembly does
not presume to set itself up as an example
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
to this country, we seem to have very lit∣tle
right to be furiously angry, because
they think proper to try another system of
government themselves. Why should
they not be suffered to make an expe∣riment
in politics? I have always been
told, that the improvement of every
science depends upon experiment. But
I now hear that, instead of their new at∣tempt
to form the great machine of so∣ciety
upon a simple principle of general
amity, upon the FEDERATION of its mem∣bers,
they ought to have repaired the feu∣dal
wheels and springs, by which their
ancestors directed its movements. Yet
if mankind had always observed this re∣trograde
motion, it would surely have led
them to few acquisitions in virtue, or in
knowledge; and we might even have
been worshipping the idols of paganism
at this moment. To forbid, under the
pains and penalties of reproach, all at∣tempts
of the human mind to advance to
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
greater perfection, seems to be pro∣scribing
every art and science. And we
cannot much wonder that the French, ha∣ving
received so small a legacy of public
happiness from their forefathers, and be∣ing
sensible of the poverty of their own
patrimony, should try new methods of
transmitting a richer inheritance to their
posterity.</P>
<P>Perhaps the improvements which man∣kind
may be capable of making in the
art of politics, may have some resem∣blance
to those they have made in the art
of navigation. Perhaps our political
plans may hitherto have been somewhat
like those ill-constructed misshapen ves∣sels,
which, unfit to combat with the
winds and waves, were only used by the
antients to convey the warriors of one
country to despoil and ravage another
neighbouring state; which only served to
produce an intercourse of hostility, a com∣munication
of injury, an exchange of ra∣pine
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
and devastation.—But it may pos∣sibly
be within the compass of human
ability to form a system of politics, which,
like a modern ship of discovery, built
upon principles that defy the opposition
of the tempestuous elements (“and pas∣sions
are the elements of life”—) instead
of yielding to their fury makes them
subservient to its purpose, and sailing
sublimely over the untracked ocean,
unites those together whom nature seem∣ed
for ever to have separated, and throws
a line of connection across the divided
world.</P>
<P>One cause of the general dislike in which
the French revolution is held in this coun∣try,
is the exaggerated stories which are
carefully circulated by such of the aristo∣crates
as have taken refuge in England.
They are not all, however, persons of this
description. There is now a young gen∣tleman
in London, nephew to the Bishop
de Sens, who has lost his fortune, his rank,
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
all his high expectations, and yet who has
the generosity to applaud the revolution,
and the magnanimity to reconcile himself
to personal calamities, from the conside∣ration
of general good; and who is
“faithful found” to his country, “among
the faithless.” I hope this amiable young
Frenchman will live to witness, and to
share the honours, the prosperity of that
regenerated country; and I also hope that
the National Assembly of France will
answer the objections of its adversaries in
the manner most becoming its own dig∣nity,
by forming such a constitution as
will render the French nation virtuous,
flourishing, and happy.</P>
