<HEAD>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF A <HI>TRIAL,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 4th of <HI>December</HI>, 1739, at nine o' Clock in the Morning, at the Sittings in the Court of <HI>King's Bench</HI> in <HI>Middlesex</HI>, before the Right Honourable Sir <HI>William Lee</HI>, Knt. <HI>Lord Chief Justice</HI> of that Court, came on a Trial by a Spe∣cial Jury of Gentlemen, of another Cause, in which <HI>Theophilus Cibber</HI>, Gent. was Plaintiff, and <HI>William Sloper</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was Defendant.</P>
<P>The Council for the Plaintiff, were Mr. <HI>Solli∣tor-General</HI>, Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI>, Mr. <HI>Bootle</HI>, Mr. <HI>Henley</HI> and Mr. <HI>Townshend</HI>. The Council for the De∣fendant were Mr. <HI>Lloyd</HI>, Mr. <HI>Clarke</HI>, Mr. <HI>Mur∣ray</HI>, Mr. <HI>Dennison</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Barnardiston</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Townshend</HI>, for the Plaintiff opened the Declaration, which was for Tresspass and Assault, in taking, leading away, and detaining the Plain∣tiff's
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
Wife; and again, for assaulting, beat∣ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Plaintiff's Wife, whereby he lost her Assistance to his Damage of TEN THOU∣SAND POUNDS.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Sollicitor-General, (John Strange</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) stated the Case for the Plaintiff; and (among other Things) took Notice,
<Q>“That there had been another Trial last Year, for a criminal Conversation, in which the Plaintiff had a Verdict: That it might have been reasonably expected the Defendant would have disconti∣nued his Acquaintance there; but it has un∣happily proved otherwise: She has been se∣creted from her Husband in an obscure Part of the World, <HI>Kennington-lane</HI>, never went abroad, and has been there visited by the Defendant Mr. <HI>Sloper:</HI> That after the former Verdict it could not be supposed they would act open∣ly, or unguardedly, to be as liable to a De∣tection, and manifest Proof: That the Declara∣tion therefore was only for detaining, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> therefore this present Trial was not likely to afford so much Mirth and Entertainment to to the Bystanders as the former; but yet that they (<HI>viz.</HI> for the Plaintiff) should lay such an Evidence before the Jury, as should make it appear the Defendant did not keep her thus retired merely to look on: That if the Wo∣man had been left to the Influence and prope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Expostulations of her Husband (who has been ready to forgive and cherish her) she migh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been reclaimed: but as the Defendant has not been deterred by the Verdict of las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
Year, here appears no Remedy against this Conduct, except another Verdict for such Damages as may be a sufficient Warning to him; otherwise he may be willing to conti∣nue this Commerce at the Expence of sub∣mitting to small Damages and Costs yearly. That the Plaintiff in wanting the Assistance of his Wife, has lost her Salary of 200 <HI>l.</HI> ”a Year, and a Benefit worth 200 <HI>l.</HI> more.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI>, on the same Side, spoke to the same Purpose; and observed, that every Body who had seen Mrs. <HI>Cibber</HI> perform, must know that she is a Woman of an excellent Under∣standing, or she could never perform so well: That this good Sense of hers must have caused or revived a Compunction in her for the false Step she had made, and have induced her to have been all Duty and Obedience to her Hus∣band, and to have used double Diligence to have retrieved, or made some Amends for the Errors of her former Behaviour; if she had not been seduced by the Defendant, who it seems has too powerful an Influence over her.</P>
<P>Here Mrs. <HI>Bret</HI> was called to prove the Mar∣riage: But Col. <HI>Moreton</HI>, acquaintaing his Lord∣ship that he had some call of a publick Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n another Place, was examined to Mr. <HI>Slo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI>'s Declarations; but the Colonel knew not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny. The Defendant's Council also admitted the Marriage.</P>

</SP>
<STAGE><PB N="6" REF="7"/>Mrs. <HI>Smith</HI> sworn.</STAGE>
<P><HI>She gave in Substance the same Account as her Husband had done, with this farther</HI>; That upon the taking her Lodgings, she [the Witness] had caused Enquiry to be made at the former Lodgings in <HI>Devonshire-Street</HI>, where they said, they could assure her, that the Gentlewoman was a mar∣ried Woman. This Witness also remembred that Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> went by the Name of <HI>Archer</HI>; that the Witness's Daughter commonly marketted for her, and had the Money from Mrs <HI>Allen</HI>.</P>

<P>He has called there twice: The first Time was about three or four Months ago; the last Time about a Fortnight or three Weeks since.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Q.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What did he say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs <HI>Smith</HI>.</SPEAKER>
<P>The last Time he said Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> had brought an Action against him; and asked if we could say any harm of him.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Mrs <HI>Sukey Smith</HI>, sworn.</STAGE>
<P>She confirmed what her Father and Mother had sworn, and gave an account of the taking the Lodging, and of Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI>'s coming there with a Maid (Mrs <HI>Allen</HI>,) and a Nurse and Child about two Months old, named <HI>Mary</HI>: She described two Gardens belonging to the House, with a Sum∣mer-house and Arbour in them, which were all within the View of ten or twelve Windows of the House, from whence every Thing could be seen
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
that was done: That one Mr <HI>Shaw</HI> a Surgeon, came there and fancied he knew Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI>. She also said, that she saw Mrs <HI>Archer</HI> write in a Book, which (she believes) was the same which was pro∣duced to her at the Trial: That the Child had the Small-pox and was attended by Mr <HI>Blisset</HI>, an A∣pothecary; that in a few Days after Mr <HI>Shaw</HI> had been there, Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> came; and the next Day af∣ter Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> had been there, Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> went away.</P>
<STAGE>Mr <HI>Smith</HI> (the Son) sworn.</STAGE>
<P><HI>He agreed with the other Witnesses, with this:</HI> I can give no Account of the Times of the Gentle∣man's coming to visit, because I generally spent all the Day in the City: Sometimes when I came home at Night, I found him there; and he went away usually at ten at Night: I am sure he never staid later than eleven.
<STAGE>[<HI>Being asked as to his Opi∣nion</HI>,]</STAGE>
At first, by Reason of his frequent coming, I believed he was a young Gentleman of Fortune who had married her unknown to his Relations; but afterwards I began to alter my Opinion, because he never lay in the House. Gentlemen, you may remember a Night of terrible Thunder and Light∣ning last Summer, he happened to be there that Night, he went away in the Midst of that Wea∣ther, though we press'd him to stay, and offered to get ready a Bed for him, but he went away, and I lent him my Great Coat.</P>
<P>This Witness gave an Account, how the Clerk of the Plaintiff's Attorney came there
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
lately to make enquiry, personating the Defen∣dant's Attorney, which the Court declared to be a foul Piece of Practice. The Plaintiff's Attor∣ney said it was done without any Order from him, he knew nothing of it.</P>
<P><HI>Watson</HI> sworn and examined; and <HI>Cross</HI> exami∣ned, said</P>
<P>I am a Shoemaker. I went along with Mr <HI>Cibber</HI>. He went up Stairs directly. He said he came to de∣mand his Wife, she promised to go. He took some Linnen and Apparrel; she was in Bed, but we went out of the Room 'till she was dress'd. He said he was to dine at the <HI>Rummer Tavern</HI> at two o'clock, and desired her to come to him there, and said she should never want a Shilling while he had it. She promised so to do. He took her Purse, in which there was eighteen Pence and a Pocket-piece, but he threw it back; he had her Watch, 'twas a Silver Watch.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Campbell</HI> (the Defendant's Banker) was sworn.</P>
<P>The Account Book was shewn to him, he never had seen the Defendant write, any more than his Name several times, but had some Letters from him. This Witness believed divers short Entries in the Account Book to be the Defendant's Hand writing, as <HI>Account at Mrs</HI> Smith<HI>'s</HI>, April 19<HI>th.</HI>— Allen <HI>having</HI> 20 <HI>Guineas in Hand.—Left in</HI> Allen'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hand</HI> 50 <HI>Guineas.— Brought forward</HI>. —</P>

<STAGE>Mrs <HI>Knightly</HI> sworn.</STAGE>
<P>I live in <HI>Devonshire-Street</HI>, Mrs <HI>Archer</HI> (whom I since hear to be Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI>) came to lodge at my House the 12th of <HI>January</HI> last, and staid there 14 Weeks all but a Day; A Gentleman came too see her sometimes, but I never knew his Name; she never went abroad all the Time; she was brought to bed there; the Christening was abroad; she had her Maid Mrs <HI>Allen</HI>, and a Wet-nurse, and a Nurse who set up with her the whole Month. She was brought to Bed on the 26th of <HI>February</HI>; they had the Dining-room and Bedchamber, and Rooms up two Pair of Stairs; the Rent was Twenty-six Shil∣lings a Week, and was paid monthly by Mrs <HI>Allen</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till the last Time. She was recommended to me as the Wife of a Country Gentleman. I heard the Nurses had three Guineas each at the Christening, and that the Christening cost ten Guineas.</P>
<STAGE>Mr <HI>Bishop</HI> sworn.</STAGE>
<P>This Witness had a Crown from Mrs <HI>Archer</HI> in <HI>Devonshire-Street</HI>, as Servant there. <HI>Note, there was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Entry in the Book of five Shillings to Mrs</HI> Bishop.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Milward</HI> being severally sworn, proved that Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> could have Two Hundred Pounds a Year Salary; and that her Benefit might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e worth One Hundred Pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>There were other Witnesses examined to shew that the Plaintiff and his Wife had formerly lived in Harmony.</P>
<P>The Defendant's Council observed upon the E∣vidence, that the Plaintiff did not come for his Wife, but to strip her of what he could find. Why did he not take her along with him?</P>
<P>In reply to this, the Plaintiff's Council shewed that the Plaintiff was at that Time under a Recog∣nizance for the Peace and Behaviour to her; and that if he should attempt to compel her to go along with him, he might be in Danger of forfeiting his Recognizance.</P>
<P>After hearing his Lordship's Charge, the Jury went out, and in less than half an Hour, found a Verdict for the Plaintiff, and <HI>Five Hundred Pound<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Damages.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>TRYAL</HI>, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON <HI>Tuesday</HI> the 5th of <HI>December</HI>, 1738, at Nine o'Clock in the Morning, at the Sittings in the Court of <HI>King's-Bench</HI> in <HI>Middlesex</HI>, before the Right Hon. Sir <HI>William Lee, Knt. Lord Chief Justice of that Court</HI>, came on the remarkable Trial before a Special Jury of Gentlemen of a Cause in which <HI>Theophilus Cibber</HI>, Gent. was Plaintiff, and <HI>William Sloper</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> was Defendant.</P>
<P>The Declaration (which was opened by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unior Council for the Plaintiff) was for As∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aulting, Ravishing, and Carnally Knowing <HI>Su∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>annah Maria Cibber</HI>, the Plaintiff's Wife: And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his was laid, to be done at three several Pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iods of Time, at divers Days between such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Day, to such a Day, at each Period; where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y (the Declaration said) the Plaintiff lost the Company, Comfort, Society, Assistance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Wife, to his Damage of FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13"/>The Council for t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plaintiff were, Mr <HI>Sollicitor General</HI>, Mr <HI>Hollings</HI>, Serjeant <HI>Agar</HI>, Mr. <HI>Marsh</HI>, Mr <HI>Dernison</HI>, and Mr <HI>Lawson</HI>. The Council for the Defendant were Serjeant <HI>Eyre</HI>, Mr <HI>Noel</HI>, Mr <HI>Lloyd</HI>, Mr <HI>Murray</HI>, and Mr <HI>Barnadiston</HI>.</P>
<P>It is here proper to let the Reader understand that this Tryal is not taken in the very Words at Length: as is sometimes done, when a Short∣hand Writer can be conveniently placed. But the Person who attended on this Occasion was at such Disadvantage, that he was forced to take it in an abridged Way; writing down the Substance of it as well as he could: W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought good to mention this, that we may not be understood to impose on our Readers nor to injure the great Men concerned: W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore hope that neither the learned Gen∣tlemen at the Bar, nor the Court, will be of¦fended, that we cannot do them full Justice i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Printing at Length the very good Argument on both Sides, and his Lordship's excellen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Charge to the Jury.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Sollicitor General, (— Strange</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Stated the Case for the Plaintiff; and (amon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many other things) observed to the Court an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Jury, that the Injury done to the Plainti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was of the most tender Concern to his Peace o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mind, Happiness, and Hopes of Posterity, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the highest of all Injuries for which h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could come before them to seek a Recompenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Satisfaction in Damages; and that indee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
it was impossible to give a pecuniary Satisfac∣tion adequate to the Injury: For that no Sum of Money could restore a Man's Tranquility of Mind. But that the Plaintiff must rest up∣on such Remedy as the Law had given him.</P>
<P>He farther observed (<HI>upon the Plaintiff's be∣ing a Player</HI>) that 'tis true the Plaintiff was a Player, but he was also a Gentleman; being well descended and having had a liberal Edu∣cation; that the Plaintiff himself was a very good Player; that his Father-was well known <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o all Gentlemen, who delighted in Theatrical Entertainments to be of the first Figure in that Profession, and an Author too; that the Plain∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iff's Grandfather was the best Statuary of his Time; and that the Plaintiff by the Mother's Side, was related to <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham:</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n right of that Pedigree, had received his Edu∣cation upon a Foundation of that great Man.</P>
<P>He said he knew it was attempted by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, to have the Players considered in a Mat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of this Nature, as not upon the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooting with the rest of the Subjects; as if it were more lawful to invade their Properties, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han those of other People; but he knew no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw that deprived them of those Comforts, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f those Rights which other Subjects ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njoy: That the Stage had been cherished <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd encouraged by the Politest and Wisest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tates, as a School of Virtue and good Morals; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that many received good Lessons and Im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressions from what they hear at the <HI>Theatre</HI>;
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
who perhaps don't incline to go seek for In∣struction elsewhere.</P>
<P>That there had been a good deal of Pains taken to spread a Report about Town as if the Plaintiff had been consenting to the Wrong the Defendant had done him; but this was only to blast the Credit of the Plaintiff's Cause be∣fore the Trial; and that it might come with Prejudice before the Jury. That his Brief in∣structed him, that there could not be the least Colour or Shadow of Proof to support such a Surmise.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Sollicitor General</HI> also Stated the Evi¦dence for the Plaintiff, in part as it comes from the Plaintiff's Witnesses in the following Pages but as to part of what comes from Mr <HI>Carte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Kensington</HI>, it doubtless was never mentio∣ned in his Brief. As to the principal Facts h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mentioned, the Witness Mr <HI>Hayes</HI>'s looking through a Hole in a Wainscoat Partition which parted Mr <HI>Hayes</HI>'s Closet from a Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in which the Defendant and Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> together; and that through that Hole M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Hayes</HI> at several different Days and Time saw them guilty of Criminal Familiarities, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in such Acts, and with such Circumstances and particularly the last Time, he, Mr <HI>Haye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw such a Sight</HI>, as he (<HI>Mr Sollicitor)</HI> woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> leave to the Witness to tell; for it ought t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be related <HI>but once</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Hollings</HI> also spoke very well on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same Side, pathetically observing to the Gen¦tlemen
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
of the Jury the mischievous Conse∣quence of Suffering a Man to commit such an Injury to the married State without being o∣bliged to repair it in Damages; that the Plain∣tiff was an <HI>Englishman</HI>, and as such, had Rights which ought not to be invaded, parti∣cularly in the present Instance; that he had brought his Complaint before a Jury of <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen, and he (Mr <HI>Hollings)</HI> did not doubt, that they would give the Plaintiff pro∣per Damages.</P>
<P>The Plaintiff's Council then proceeded to call their Witnesses: And First, to prove the Marriage between the Plaintiff and his Wife, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey called Mrs <HI>Brett</HI>, but she did not appear <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this time.</P>

<P>This last Question was asked because it had been insinuated that Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI> at that very time cohabited with Mr <HI>Sloper</HI>.</P>
<P>Mr Serjeant <HI>Eyre</HI>, for the Defendant, ope¦ned the Defence. And among other thing
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
observed, that he believed this was the first Action of the kind, that ever came from the Theatre; that he never heard that it was a place celebrated for Virtue: that Mr Sollicitor General had taken some pains to display the Plaintiff's Pedigree as descended from <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickam</HI>; that there was no Proof made of this Pedigree; but he observed in the time of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickam</HI>, who was a Clergyman, Celibacy prevailed among the Clergy; therefore the Plaintiff could not be descended in a <HI>right line</HI> from him. That Love is the most govern∣ing Passion in human Nature; that as it is so all Theatrical Performances abound with it; that they cannot expect to please without it: That a very wise and modest Man who hath wrote one of the best Plays extant, could not depend on his Hero for Success; that he was forced to interlard it with Love Scenes, or it might probably have been damned the first Night; and this is the Tragedy of <HI>Cato</HI>. That the Hero of this Piece, that very <HI>Cato</HI>, the greatest Man of the Time he lived in; is re∣corded in History to have had very free Notions of Love and Matrimony; that he lent his Wife to a Friend to breed out of her, and when they had done, he took her back again, very well contented. That the Players are a People who act, and enter into all manner of Cha∣racters; that their Men and Women are made to fall in Love with each other every Day, this Day with one, Tomorrow with another;
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
that this Practice in Variety must give them an uncommon Propensity to Love, without any Confinement of the Passion to a particular Sub∣ject; that 'tis very likely this enters into their common Course of Life. That their Women learn all the Allurements that can engage the Eye and Ear, and strike the Imagination of young Gentlemen; they dress, chat, sing, dance, and every way charm unguarded young Gentlemen, who are not aware of any ill Con∣sequences. That it had already appeared, and would further appear in the Course of the Evi∣dence, that if there was a Suspicion of any thing amiss in the Acquaintance between Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> and Mrs <HI>Cibber</HI>, that the Plaintiff must thank himself for it; that the Plaintiff had taken Pains to bring them acquainted, to live under the same Roof, and used to leave them together to improve their Acquaintance; that he (Serjeant <HI>Eyre</HI>) hoped, that no∣thing criminal had passed between them; but if there had, the Plaintiff had certainly encou∣raged it, and had no Pretence to come to a Jury for Damages.</P>
<P>Mr <HI>Lloyd</HI>, on the same Side, made an excel∣lent Speech, which we do not take upon us to give the Reader; we shall only mention a Hint or two. He hoped (as Mr Serjeant <HI>Eyre</HI> had done) that nothing Criminal had passed between the Defendant and the Plaintiff's Wife; but if any thing seemed to tend that way, it at the same time appeared, that the

Plaintiff was privy and consenting to whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntercourse or Familiarities there passed between <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem. That if there had been any thing done <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>miss with such Circumstances (he submitted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Lordship's Direction, but) apprehended <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Plaintiff had no Wrong done him, up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this Maxim in Law and Reason, <HI>Volenti <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on fit injuria</HI>; and that therefore he (the Plaintiff) ought not to have a Verdict. But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat if it should be thought proper (notwith∣tanding such Consent) to find a Verdict for the Plaintiff, it would at least be fit and necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Gentlemen of the Jury to proportion it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>Size</HI> of the Trespass, which he hoped would be taken in Consideration upon this Oc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion. — He said this and much more, in much better manner than we can relate it for a Reason already given) and proceeded to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Evidence for the Defendant.</P>

I do not fear my Character; ther<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are enough in Court that will give me a ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good Character. It was about <HI>March</HI> wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Twelve-month that Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> used first t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to our House to Mr <HI>Cibber</HI>'s: The Ser¦vants did not know who he was; but my Ma¦ster called him Mr <HI>Benefit</HI>, and used to say h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a <HI>Romp</HI>, and a <HI>good-natured Boy</HI>. Mr <HI>Cib¦ber</HI> was then very bare of Money, and afrai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Creditors. I was very sorry for it; s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he owed me a good deal of Money, and do so still.

<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
and you shall have some. And I know he soon after had a good deal of Money, and he paid me five Guineas. That Summer we went to lodge at <HI>Kingston</HI>, and Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> with us. My Master used often to leave Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> and my Mistress at Home, and go a Riding or Abroad, some where or other. The rest of the Servants wondered at it as well as I; but I knew no Harm. They did not know Mr <HI>Slo∣per</HI>'s Name. My Master called him his Cousin <HI>Thompson</HI>. Afterwards when they came to Town, I left the Service, and took that Lodg∣ing. In last Spring, about <HI>March</HI> last, I lived with them again. My Master took me aside, and made me promise Secrecy concerning some∣thing he was about to say to me. He told me he was going to <HI>France:</HI> That there was an Affair between Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> and his Wife: That he was ruined for ever if it should be publickly known. And he made me promise to live with her till he should come back, that the rest of the Servants might not know any thing of the Matter. I promised him. They took Lodg∣ings at <HI>Kensington</HI>, and my Master went to <HI>France</HI> in <HI>March or April</HI>. He was some Weeks gone, and in his Abscence Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> was commonly at the Lodgings at <HI>Kensington</HI>. When my Master came back he was at a Bag∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io in <HI>Goodman's Fields</HI>, and sent Word to my Mistress. Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> was not then at <HI>Kensing∣ton</HI>. My Mistress and I went to <HI>Goodman's Fields</HI> in a Hackney Coach, and he came back
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
with us to <HI>Kensington</HI>. In our Return w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> changed our Coach two or three times by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Way, that he might not be discovered. Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told him, she expected Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> in a Day o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two. My Master said he would take a Lodg¦ing when Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> came; or if there was no time for that, he would go lie at some Inn i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Town. Within two or three Days Mr <HI>Slo¦per</HI> came; and then Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> sent and took a Lodging at <HI>Blue-Green</HI>, and after Supper about nine or ten o'Clock he went there, with a Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carrying a Lanthorn and Candle, and left Mr <HI>Cibber</HI> and Mr <HI>Sloper</HI> at the Lodgings at <HI>Ken∣sington</HI>.

<P>As hath been said with regard the rest of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Council, so as to Mr <HI>Murray</HI>, we shall men∣tion but a few hints from his Speech.</P>
<P>He observed that the Plaintiff by his Coun∣cil shewed himself related to <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ham</HI>;
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
but would have been better entitled to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laim that Alliance if he had observed <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham</HI>'s Motto, that <HI>Morals make the Man</HI>. The Words are <HI>Manners make the Man</HI>; but <HI>Manners</HI> are there intended to sig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ify <HI>Morals</HI>.</P>
<P>That upon the whole of the Evidence, (he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Council) was afraid that the Plaintiff's Wife and the Defendant had gone beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounds of Duty; but whatever had passed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppeared not only to have been with the Plain∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff's Consent, but even to have been concert∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by him. That the Defendant was a young <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entleman of Fortune, who became acquaint∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with a Player and his Wife: That she being distress of the alluring Arts of the Stage, first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gages the young Gentleman's Affection and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws him in, and this with the Husband's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tivity and Assistance. For the Plaintiff conceals <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Defendant's true Name from the Know∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge of the Servants; at one place he calls him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousin <HI>Thompson</HI>; at another, Mr <HI>Benefit</HI>; a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Name, taken from a particular Night in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Year when they get a great deal of money. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Plaintiff tells the Servants the Defendant a <HI>Romp</HI>, and <HI>a good natur'd Boy</HI>; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes a Boy of him. He takes his Money, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s him maintain his Family, resigns his Wife him; and then comes to a Court of Justice, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to a Jury of Gentlemen for Reparation in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amages. The Council further represented, at it would be of the utmost ill Consequence,
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
if it should once come to be understood in the World, that two artful People, being Husband and Wife, might lay a Snare for the Affection of an unwary young Gentleman, take a Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Money from him, and when he woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> part with no more, then come for a secon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sum to a Court of Justice.</P>
<P>That he (the Council) desired to be un∣derstood as by no means an Advocate for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Immorality of the Action; but this is not Prosecution for the Publick, or to punish th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Immorality: This is only a Question whether the Defendant has injur'd the Plaintiff; and certainly the Plaintiff cannot be injured, if h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has not only consented, but has even taken Price.</P>
<P>However if it should be thought requisit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to find a Verdict for the Plaintiff; we had not a Denomination of Coin small enough to be given him in Damages.</P>
<P>Mr Sollicitor General in his Reply, observe the ill Consequence of letting it pass for a La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Men might sell their Wives, which wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be the Consequence of giving a Verdict <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Defendant.</P>
<P>His Lordship summed up the Evidence,</P>
<P>And the Jury withdrew, and in about h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Hour, brought in a Verdict for the Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tiff, and Ten Pounds Damages.</P>
