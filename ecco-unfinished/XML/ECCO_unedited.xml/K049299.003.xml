<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> THE parliament, having performed the ceremony of addresses to the throne, im∣mediately<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of supply granted in parlia∣ment for the year 1759.</NOTE> proceeded to the great work of the supply. The two committees in the house of commons were immediately established, and con∣tinued by adjournments to the month of May, by the twenty-third day of which all their resolutions were taken. They voted sixty thousand men, in∣cluding fourteen thousand eight hundred and forty-five marines, for the service of the ensuing year; and for the operations by land, a body of troops amounting to fifty-two thousand five hundred and fifty-three effective men, besides the auxiliaries of Hanover, Hesse, Brunswic, Saxe-Gotha, and Bucke∣bourg, to the number of fifty thousand, and five

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> battalions on the Irish establishment, in actual ser∣vice in America and Africa. For the maintenance of the sixty thousand men employed in the sea-service, they granted three millions one hundred and twenty thousand pounds; for the land-forces, one million two hundred fifty-six thousand one hundred and thirty pounds fifteen shillings and two pence; for the charge of the additional five batta∣lions, forty thousand eight hundred and seventy-nine pounds thirteen shillings and nine-pence; for the pay of the general and staff-officers, and hospi∣tals of the land-forces, fifty-two thousand four hun∣dred and eighty-four pounds one shilling and eight pence; for maintaining the garrisons in the plan∣tations, Gibraltar, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Providence, Cape Breton, and Senegal, the sum of seven hundred and forty-two thousand five hundred and thirty-one pounds five shillings and seven pence; for the charge of ordnance for land service, two hundred and twenty thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine pounds eleven shillings and nine pence; for extraordinary service performed by the same office, and not provided for by parliament in the course of the preceding year, three hundred twenty-three thousand nine hundred and eighty-seven pounds thirteen shillings and three pence; for the ordinary of the navy, including half-pay to sea-officers, two hundred and thirty-eight thousand four hundred and ninety-one pounds nine shillings and eight pence; towards the support of Green∣wich hospital, and for the out-pensioners of Chel∣sea-college, the sum of thirty-six thousand pounds. They allotted for one year's expence, incurred by the foreign troops in the pay of Great Britain, one

million two hundred thirty-eight thousand one<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> hundred and seventy-seven pounds nineteen shil∣lings and ten pence, over and above sixty thousand pounds, for enabling his majesty to fulfil his en∣gagements with the landgrave of Hesse Cassel, pur∣suant to the separate article of a new treaty con∣cluded between them in the month of January of this current year, stipulating that this sum should be paid to his serene highness, in order to facili∣tate the means by which he might again fix his residence in his own dominions, and by his pre∣sence give fresh courage to his faithful subjects. Eighty thousand pounds were granted for enabling his majesty to discharge the like sum, raised in pur∣suance of an act passed in the preceding session, and charged upon the first aids or supplies to be granted in this session of parliament. The sum of two hundred thousand pounds was voted towards the building and repairing ships of war for the en∣suing year. Fifteen thousand pounds were allowed for improving London-bridge; and forty thousand on account for the Foundling-hospital. For the charge of transports to be employed in the course of the year, they assigned six hundred sixty-seven thousand seven hundred and twenty-one pounds nineteen shillings and seven-pence: for maintain∣ing the colonies of Nova Scotia and Georgia, they bestowed twenty-five thousand two hundred and thirty-eight pounds thirteen shillings and five pence. To replace sums taken from the sinking fund, thirty-three thousand two hundred and fifty-two pounds eighteen shillings and ten pence half-penny; for maintaining the British forts and settle∣ments on the coast of Africa, ten thousand pounds;
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and for paying off the mortgage on an estate, de∣vised for the endowment of a professorship in the university of Cambridge, the sum of twelve hun∣dred and eighty pounds. For the expence of the militia they voted ninety thousand pounds: for ex∣traordinary expences relating to the land-forces, incurred in the course of last year, and unprovided for by parliament, the sum of four hundred sixty-six thousand seven hundred and eighty-five pounds ten shillings five pence and three farthings. For the purchase of certain lands and hereditaments, in order to secure the king's docks at Portsmouth, Chatham, and Plymouth, they granted thirty-six thousand nine hundred and sixty six-pounds two shillings and ten pence. They voted two hundred thousand pounds for enabling his majesty to give proper compensations to the respective provinces in North America, for the expences they had incurred in levying and maintaining troops for the service of the public. They granted twenty thousand pounds to the East India company, towards en∣abling them to defray the expence of a military force in their settlements; and the same sum was granted for carrying on the fortifications to secure the harbour of Milford. To make good several sums issued by his majesty, for indemnifying the innholders and victuallers of Hampshire, for the expences they had incurred by quartering the Hes∣sian auxiliaries in England; for an addition to the salaries of judges; and other less considerable pur∣poses, they allowed the sum of twenty-six thousand one hundred and seventy-eight pounds sixteen shil∣lings and six pence. Finally, they voted one mil∣lion, upon account, for enabling the king to de∣fray
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
any extraordinary expence of the war, incurred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> or to be incurred, for the service of the current year; and to take all such measures as might be necessary to disappoint or defeat any enterprizes or designs of his enemies, as the exigency of affairs should require.</P>
<P>The sum of all the grants voted by the commit∣tee of supply, amounted to twelve millions seven hundred sixty-one thousand three hundred and ten pounds nineteen shillings and five pence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Funds al∣lotted for raising the sup∣ply.</NOTE> The funds allotted for raising this vast supply, consisted of the land-tax at four shillings in the pound, the malt-tax continued, and the following expedients. They resolved, that the annuities at three per centum, amounting to three millions one hundred thousand pounds, granted in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, should be, with the consent of the several proprietors, added to the joint-stock of three per centum transferable annuities at the bank of England, consolidated by the acts passed in the twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth years of his majesty's reign, and the charges and expences thereof to be charged upon the sinking-fund until redemption by parlia∣ment; and that all such persons as should not, be∣fore the fifth of April next, signify their dissent, in books to be opened at the Bank for that purpose, should be deemed assenting to this proposal. They further resolved, that all the moneys which might arise, after the fifth day of January, from the pro∣duce of the additional stamp-duties on pamphlets, printed papers, coals exported, the surplus of the new duty on licences for retailing wine and spiritu∣ous liquors, which were constituted a fund for pay∣ing
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> three per centum per annum at the Bank, on three millions borrowed, by virtue of an act passed in the thirtieth year of his majesty's reign, towards the supply of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty▪seven; as also the annuities on single lives, payable at the receipt of the Exchequer, in respect of the same, should be added to the sinking-fund. They resolved, that six millions six hundred thou∣sand pounds should be raised by transferable annui∣ties, after the rate of three pounds per centum per annum; and that an additional capital of fifteen pounds should be added to every hundred pounds advanced; which additional capital should consist of ten pounds, given in a lottery-ticket to each subscriber, and of five pounds in like transferable annuities at three pounds per centum: the blanks and prizes of the lottery to be attended with like annuities, after the rate of three pounds per cen∣tum per annum, to commence from the fifth day of January in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and sixty: that the sum of six millions six hundred thousand pounds, together with the said additional capital of five pounds per centum, amounting to three hundred and thirty thousand pounds, making in the whole six millions nine hundred and thirty thousand pounds, should bear interest after the rate of three per centum, to com∣mence on the fifth day of July next ensuing; that these annuities should be transferable at the bank of England, and charged upon a fund established for that purpose in this session of parliament, for which the sinking▪fund should be a collateral secu∣rity, redeemable by parliament in the whole, or in part, by sums not less than five hundred thousand
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
pounds at one time, six months notice having<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> been first given of such payments respectively: that the lottery should consist of tickets valued at ten pounds each, in a proportion not exceeding eight blanks to a prize, each blank to be valued at six pounds. They resolved, that every subscriber should, on or before the thirteenth day of Februa∣ry, make a deposit of fifteen per centum, on such sum as he should chuse to subscribe towards raising the six millions six hundred thousand pounds, with the cashiers of the bank of England, as a security for his making the future payments on or before the times limited by the act: that the several sums so received should, by the cashiers, be payed into the receipt of his majesty's Exchequer, to be ap∣plied, from time to time, to such services as the commons should then have voted, and not for any other purpose: that any subscriber, paying the whole, or any part of his subscription, previous to the days appointed for the respective payments, should be allowed a discount, after the rate of three pounds per centum per annum, from the days of such respective payments to the times prescribed. They resolved, that a subsidy of one shilling in the pound should be imposed on all tobacco, foreign linens, sugar and other grocery, East India com∣modities, foreign brandy, spirits, and paper im∣ported into Great Britain, according to the value settled on each commodity by the several books of rates, or any acts of parliament, over and above the present duties charged upon these articles. They laid an additional inland duty of one shilling per po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d upon all coffee sold in Great Britain, by wholesale or retail; and another of nine pence per
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> pound upon chocolate, over and above the former inland duty, and all customs payed on its importa∣tion. They resolved, that such part of the hundred thousand pounds, granted in the last session, towards defraying the expence of the militia, as remained in the Exchequer, after satisfaction of that ex∣pence, should be issued and applied towards raising the supply granted in this session. That after the fifth day of July, in the current year, any person might trade in any goods or wares, in which the quantity of gold, in any one separate piece, should not exceed two penny weights, or the quantity of silver be under five penny weights, without being liable to take out a licence for that purpose; but that, from the same date, every person selling gold or silver plate, or goods in which gold or silver is manufactured, and the quantity of gold in one dis∣tinct piece should amount to two ounces or up∣wards, or the quantity of silver in one piece amounts to thirty ounces or upwards, should pay five pounds for an annual licence, instead of the forty shillings formerly payable for this purpose; and that all pawnbrokers, refiners, and others, trading in gold and silver plate, should be obliged to take out this new annual licence: the sums thus raised to be applied to the same uses and purposes, to which the sums charged on licences by an act of last session were applicable. They resolved, that the act to settle the trade to Africa, passed in the reign of William III. for allowing, during a limited time, a drawback of the duties upon the exporta∣tion of copper bars imported, with a proviso con∣tinued by several successive acts, and now near ex∣piring, should be further protracted; that so much
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
of an act, passed in the eighth year of George I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> for encouraging the silk manufacture of the king∣dom, as relates to this encouragement, and to taking off several duties on merchandize exported, should likewise be continued. They moreover voted the continuation of so much of an act passed in the second year of George II. for the better preservation of his majesty's woods in America, as related to the premium upon masts, yards, and bowsprits, tar, pitch, and turpentine. They re∣solved, that the act for encouraging the growth of coffee in the American plantations, and another for the more effectual securing the duties on foreign-made sail-cloth imported into the kingdom, should be continued. They determined, that the sums remaining in the receipt of the Exchequer, dis∣posable by parliament, amounting to the sum of two hundred fifty-three thousand three hundred and eighty-four pounds eleven pence, should be applied towards making good the supply granted in this session. They resolved, that the duties payable upon raw short silk or capiton, and silk nubs or husks, should, after the fifth day of July, cease and determine; but, in lieu thereof, that the same duties should be payed upon the importation of these articles, as were payed upon raw long silk imported, and applied to the same purposes.</P>
<P>Towards the present supply they likewise allotted the sum of one hundred thousand pounds, repayed into the receipt of the Exchequer, being the sum which was granted in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-five, for enabling the king to fulfil his engagements with the empress of Russia. For defraying the expence incurred by the addi∣tional
<PB N="12" REF="110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> salaries granted to the judges, they imposed an additional stamp-duty of six-pence upon every piece of vellum or parchment, or sheet or piece of paper, on which should be engrossed or written any affidavit used in any court of law or equity at Westminster, or in the courts of the great sessions in Wales, or county-palatine of Chester, except affidavits taken pursuant to several acts made in the thirtieth and thirty-second years of the reign of Charles II. for burying in woollen; and except such affidavits as should be taken before the officers of the customs, or any justice of the peace, or commissioners appointed by act of parliament for assessing or levying aids or duties granted to his majesty, which affidavits should be taken by the said officers of the customs, justices, or commis∣sioners, by virtue of their authority, as justices of the peace, or commissioners, respectively. This additional stamp-duty was charged on all affidavits read and filed in the aforesaid courts of judicature; on all paper and vellum used for common bail, rules, or orders, copies of rules or orders, original writs, subpoenas, process or mandate that should issue from or pass the seals of any of the courts of Westminster, courts of the great sessions in Wales, courts in the counties-palatine, or any other court whatever holding plea, where the debt or damage amounts to forty shillings or above, or the thing demanded is of that value; excepting, however, writs of covenant for levying fines, writs of entry for suffering common recoveries, and writs of ha∣beas corpus. They moreover established an addi∣tional stamp-duty of one penny upon every sheet of paper or piece of vellum, used for depositions taken
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
in the court of Chancery, or other court of equity<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> at Westminster, (except the paper-draughts of de∣positions taken by virtue of any commission before they are engrossed) for copies of bills, answers, pleas, demurrers, replications, rejoinders, interro∣gatories, depositions, or other proceedings whatso∣ever, in this or any other court of judicature in England and Wales. The augmentation of sala∣ries granted to the judges in Scotland was charged upon the duties and revenues collected in that part of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Finally, the commons resolved, that the sum of two millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds should be issued out of the sinking-fund towards the supply of the current year; and one million raised by exchequer-bills, chargeable on the first aids to be granted in the next session of par∣liament.</P>
<P>On the whole, the provision made by the com∣mittee of ways and means amounted to twelve mil∣lions nine hundred ninety-one thousand two hun∣dred and thirty-nine pounds; so that there was an excess of two hundred twenty-nine thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight pounds one shilling and four pence, besides the uncertain sum arising from the overplus of what had been voted for the main∣tenance and cloathing of the militia. Nearly two millions of this supply was granted for the purpose of carrying on the war in Germany, exclusive of the extraordinary expence incurred by transporting and recruiting the national troops of Great Britain in actual service upon that continent, train of ar∣tillery, convoys, forage, hospitals, and other con∣tingencies of a compaign. Indeed, the whole ex∣pence
<PB N="14" REF="130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of maintaining these troops ought to be placed to the account of the German war, inasmuch as their absence from Great Britain laid the nation under the necessity of retaining the militia in ac∣tual service. The bills founded on these resolu∣tions were passed with great unanimity, and re∣ceived the sanction of the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's message to the com∣mons.</NOTE> The commons were still employed in delibera∣tions on ways and means on the twenty second day of May, when Mr. secretary Pitt communicated to them a message from the king, couched in these terms: "His majesty, relying on the experienced zeal and affection of his faithful commons, and considering that, in this critical conjuncture, emer∣gencies may arise, which may be of the utmost im∣portance, and be attended with the most pernici∣ous consequences, if proper means should not im∣mediately be applied to prevent or defeat them, is desirous that this house will enable him to defray any extraordinary expences of the war, incurred, or to be incurred, for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine, and to take all such measures as may be necessary to disappoint or defeat any enterprizes or designs of his enemies, and as the exigencies of affairs may require."</P>
<P>This message being read, a motion was made, and agreed to nemine contradicente, that it should be referred to the committee, who forthwith formed upon it the resolution, whereby one million was granted, to be raised by loans, or exchequer-bills, chargeable on the first aids that should be given in the next session. This produced a bill en∣abling his majesty to raise the sum of one million, for the uses and purposes therein mentioned, com∣prehending
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
a clause, allowing the bank of England<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to advance, on the credit of the loan therein men∣tioned, any sum not exceeding a million, notwith∣standing the act of the fifth and sixth years in the reign of William and Mary, by which the Bank was established.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bills re∣lating to the distil∣lery and exporta∣tion of corn.</NOTE> The bills relating solely to the supply being dis∣cussed and expedited, the house proceeded as usual to enact other laws for the advantage of the com∣munity. Petitions having been presented by the cities of Bristol and New Sarum, alledging, that since the laws prohibiting the making of low wines and spirits from grain, meal, and flour, had been in force, the commonalty appeared more sober, healthy, and industrious; representing the ill con∣sequences which they apprehended would attend the repeal of these laws, and therefore praying their continuance; a committee of the whole house re∣solved, that the prohibition to export corn should be continued to the twenty-fourth day of Decem∣ber, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine; subject, nevertheless, to such provisions for shortening the said term of its continuance as should therefore be made by any act of that session, or by his majesty with the advice of his privy coun∣cil, during the recess of parliament; that the act for discontinuing the duties upon corn and flour imported, or brought in as prize, was not proper to be further continued; and that the prohibition to make low wines or spirits from any sort of grain, meal, or flour, should be continued to the twenty-fourth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine. Before the bill was formed on these resolutions, petitions arrived from
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Liverpool and Bath, to the same purport as were those of Bristol and Sarum; while, on the other hand, a remonstrance was presented by a great number of the malt-distillers of the city and sub∣urbs of London, alledging, that it having been deemed expedient to prohibit the distilling of spi∣rits from any sort of grain to the twenty-fourth day of December then instant, some of the petitioners had entirely ceased to carry on the business of dis∣tilling; while others, merely with a view to preserve their customers, the compound distillers, and em∣ploy some of their servants, horses, and utensils, had submitted to carry on the distillation of spirits from molasses and sugars under great disadvantages, in full hope that the said restraint would cease at the expiration of the limited time, or at least when the necessity which occasioned that restraint should be removed; that it was with great concern they observed a bill would be brought in for protract∣ing the said prohibition, at a time when the price of all manner of grain, and particularly of wheat and barley, was considerably reduced, and, as they humbly conceived, at a reasonable medium. They expatiated on the great loss they, as well as many traders and artificers dependents upon them, must sustain, in case the said bill should be passed into a law. They prayed the house to take these circum∣stances into consideration, and either permit them to carry on the distillation from wheat, malt, and other grain, under such restrictions as should be judged necessary; or to grant them such other re∣lief, in respect of their several losses and incum∣brances, as to the house should seem reasonable and expedient. This petition, though strenuously
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>
urged by a powerful and clamorous body without<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> doors, did not meet with great encouragement within. It was ordered to lie upon the table, and an instruction was given to the committee, impowering them to receive a clause or clauses to allow the transportation of certain quantities of meal, flour, bread, and biscuit, to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, for the sole use of the inhabitants; and an∣other to prohibit the making of low wines and spi∣rits from bran.</P>
<P>Much more attention was paid to a petition of several farmers in the county of Norfolk, repre∣senting, that their farms consisted chiefly of arable land, which produced much greater quantities of corn than could be consumed within that county; that in the last harvest there was a great and plenti∣ful crop of all sorts of grain, the greatest part of which had, by unfavourable weather, been ren∣dered unfit for sale at London, or other markets, for home consumption; that large quantities of malt were then lying at London, arising chiefly from the crop of barley growing in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-seven, the sale of which was stagnated; that the petitioners being in∣formed the house had ordered in a bill to continue the prohibition of corn exported, they begged leave to observe, that, should it pass into a law, it would be extremely prejudicial to all, and ruin many farmers of that county, as they had offered their corn for sale at divers ports and markets of the said county; but the merchants refused to buy it at any price, alledging its being unfit for the London market, the great quantity of corn with which that market was already overstocked, and
<PB N="18" REF="170"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> their not being allowed either to export it, or make it into malt for exportation: they therefore prayed this prohibition might be removed, or they the petitioners indulged with some other kind of relief. Although this remonstrance was duly considered, the bill passed with the amendments, because of the proviso, by which his majesty in council was im∣powered to shorten the date of the prohibition, with respect to the exportation of corn, during the recess of parliament: but the temporary restraint laid upon distillation was made absolute, without any such condition, to the no small disappointment and mortification of the distillers, who had spared no pains and expence, by private solicitation and strenuous dispute in the public papers, to recom∣mend their cause to the favour of the community.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argu∣ments used for and a∣gainst the malt-dis∣tillery.</NOTE> They urged, that malt-spirits, when used in mo∣deration, far from being prejudicial to the health of individuals, were, in many damp and marshy parts of the kingdom, absolutely necessary for pre∣serving the field labourers from agues, and other distempers produced by the cold and moisture of the climate; that if they were debarred the use of malt-spirits, they would have recourse to French brandy, with which, as they generally resided near the sea coast, the smugglers would provide them almost as cheap as the malt-spirits could be afford∣ed: thus the increased consumption of French spirit would drain the nation of ready money to a considerable amount, and prejudice the king's re∣venue in the same proportion. They observed, that many distillers had already quitted that branch of trade, and disposed of their materials; that all of them would probably take the same resolution,
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
should the bill pass into a law, as no man could<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759▪</NOTE> foresee when the prohibition would cease, should it be continued at a time when all sorts of grain abounded in such plenty: that the very waste of materials by disuse, over and above the lying out the money, would be of great prejudice to the pro∣prietor: thus the business of distilling, by which so many families were supported, would be banished from the kingdom intirely: especially as the ex∣pence of establishing a large distillery was so great that no man would chuse to employ his money for this purpose, judging from experience, that some future accidental scarcity of corn might induce the legislature to interpose a ruinous delay in this branch of business. They affirmed, that, from the excessive use of malt-spirits, no good argument could be drawn against this branch of traffick, no more than against any other conveniency of life: that the excessive use of common beer or ale was prejudicial to the health and morals of the people, yet no person ever thought of putting an end to the practice of brewing, in order to prevent the abuse of brewed liquors. They urged, that in all parts of Great Britain there are some parcels of land that produce nothing to advantage, but a coarse kind of barley called big, which, though neither fit for brewing or for baking, may never∣theless be used in the distillery, and is accordingly purchased by those concerned in this branch at such an encouraging price, as enables many farmers to pay a higher rent to their landlords than they could otherwise afford: that there are every year some parcels of all sorts of grain so damaged by unsea∣sonable weather, or other accidents, as to be ren∣dered
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> altogether unfit for bread or brewery, and would prove a very great misfortune to the farmer, if there was no distillery, for the use of which he could sell this damaged commodity. They asserted, that malt-spirits were absolutely necessary for pro∣secuting some branches of foreign commerce, par∣ticularly the trade to the coast of Africa, for which traffick no assortment could be made up without a large quantity of geneva, of which the natives are so fon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that they will not traffick with any mer∣chant who has not a considerable quantity, not only for sale, but also for presents to their chiefs and rulers: that the merchants of Great Britain must either have this commodity of their own produce, or import it at a great national expence from Hol∣land: that the charge of this importation, together with the duties payable upon it, some part of which is not to be drawn back on exportation; would render it impossible for the traders to sell it so cheap on the coast of Africa as it might be sold by the Dutch, who are the great rivals of Great Britain in this branch of commerce.</P>
<P>To these arguments, all of which were plausible, and some of them unanswerable, it was replied, that the malt-spirits might be considered as a fatal and bewitching poison, which had actually de∣bauched the minds and enervated the bodies of the common people to a very deplorable degree; that, without entering further into a comparison between the use and abuse of the two liquors, beer and ge∣neva, it would be sufficient to observe, that the use of beer and ale had produced none of those dreadful effects which were the consequences of drinking geneva; and since the prohibition of the
<PB N="21" REF="200"/>
distillery of malt-spirits had taken place, the com∣mon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> people were become apparently more sober, decent, healthy, and industrious: a circumstance sufficient to induce the legislature not only to inter∣mit, but even totally to abolish the practice of dis∣tillation, which has ever been productive of such intoxication, ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, disorder, and distemper, among the lower class of the people, as might be deemed the greatest evils incident to a well-regulated com∣monwealth. Their assertion with respect to the coarse kind of barley, called big, was contradicted as a deviation from truth, inasmuch as it was used in making malt, as well as in making bread: and, with respect to damaged corn, those who under∣stood the nature of grain affirmed, that, if it was spoiled to such a degree as to be altogether unfit for either of these purposes, the distillers would not purchase it at such a price as would indemnify the farmer for the charge of threshing and carriage; for the distillers are very sensible, that their great∣est profit is derived from their distilling the malt made from the best barley, so that the increase of the produce far exceeded in proportion the advance of the price. It was not, however, an easy matter to prove that the distillation of malt-spirits was not necessary to an advantageous prosecution of the commerce on the coast of Guinea, as well as among the Indians in some parts of North America. Cer∣tain it is, that in these branches of traffick the want of geneva may be supplied by spirits distilled from sugars and molasses.</P>
<P>After all, it must be owned, that the good and salutary effects of the prohibition were visible in every part of the kingdom, and no evil conse∣quences

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Petition by the justices of Norfolk.</NOTE> In the mean time, all sorts of grain continuing to fall in price, and great plenty appearing in every part of the kingdom, the justices of the peace, and of the grand juries assembled at the general quarter sessions of the peace held for the county of Norfolk, composed and presented to the house of commons, in the beginning of February, a petition, representing, that the weather proving unfavourable in the harvest, great part of the bar∣ley raised in that county was much damaged, and rendered unfit for any other use than that of being made into malt for exportation; that, unless it should be speedily manufactured for that purpose, it would be intirely spoiled, and perish in the hands of the growers, a loss that must be very sensibly felt by the land owners: they therefore intreated, that leave might be given for the exportation of malt; and that they might be favoured with such farther relief, as to the house should seem just and reasonable. In consequence of this petition, the house resolved itself into a committee, to deliberate upon the subject; and as it appeared, upon exami∣nation, that the price of grain was reduced very low, and great abundance diffused through the king∣dom, they resolved, that the continuance of that
<PB N="23" REF="220"/>
part of the act prohibiting the exportation of grain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> ought to be abridged and shortened, and the ex∣portation of these commodities allowed under pro∣per regulations, with respect to the time of such exportation, and the allowance of bounties there∣upon. A bill, being founded on these resolutions, was discussed, and underwent several amendments: a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> length, it was sent with a new title to the lords, who passed it without further alteration, and then it obtained the royal sanction.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the price of corn.</NOTE> The price of corn however, in the London-market ought not alone to determine the delibera∣tions of the legislature on this important article. The eastern counties, containing more arable land than is to be found in the western provinces, can easily supply the markets of the metropolis by sea-carriage; whereas the dealers of that part of the kingdom will rather export their corn to Holland, even without a bounty, then convey it to any western port in England, because the navigation to Holland being shorter, and less dangerous, the freight and insurance will be defrayed at a small expence. This being the case, the London-market is often over-stocked with grain, when the western counties labour under a real scarcity. In order to remedy and remove this inconvenience, a law might be enacted, prohibiting the exportation of corn, except when the market-price throughout England remains at or under a certain standard or established rate, and determining this rate by the medium price at which corn shall have been sold for three market-days, at the chief weekly markets in two or three of the midland western counties, where all sorts of corn have for some years borne
<PB N="24" REF="230"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the highest price. This expedient would oblige the dealers in corn, residing in the eastern divisions, to convey their grain to the western ports rather than to Holland, notwithstanding the greater ex∣pence of the transportation, that the price of corn in those midland counties should not rise so high as to put a stop to the payment of the bounty, or the liberty of exporting. The expediency of some such regulation the reader will easily conceive, when he is informed, that about the time when this bill was ordered to be brought in, the best wheat was sold at two shillings per bushel in the county of Norfolk; whereas the same commodity was sold at that very period for three times the price in some parts of Wiltshire. It may so happen, that the best sort of wheat shall sell in some midland western counties at twelve shillings per bushel, and all other sorts of grain dear in proportion; while, at the same time, the same kind of wheat shall be sold for four shillings in Norfolk, and all other sorts of grain proportionably cheap. In such a case, it would be extremely absurd to permit an exporta∣tion from any port in the kingdom; and much more ridiculous still to encourage the exportation, by a bounty, from the ports of Norfolk; yet this case may happen, according to the law as it stands at present.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for the im∣portation of salted beef, &amp;c. from Ire∣land, con∣tinued.</NOTE> While this affair was under the deliberation of the committee, the commons unanimously issued an order for leave to bring in a bill to continue, for a limited time, the act of last session, permitting the importation of salted beef from Ireland into Great Britain, with an instruction to receive a clause extending this permission to all sorts of salted
<PB N="25" REF="240"/>
pork, or hog-meat, as the officers of the custom-house<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> had refused to admit hams from Ireland to an entry. The bill likewise received another con∣siderable alteration, importing, That, instead of the duty of one shilling and three pence, charged by the former act on every hundred weight of salted beef or pork imported from Ireland, which was found not adequate to the duty payable for such a quantity of salt as is requisite to be used in curing and salting thereof; and to prevent as well the expence to the revenue, as the detriment and loss which would accrue to the owner and importer, from opening the casks in which the provision is generally deposited, with the pickle or brine proper for preserving the same, in order to ascertain the net weight of the provision liable to the said du∣ties;—for these reasons it was enacted, That from and after the twenty-fourth day of last December, and during the continuance of this act, a duty of three shillings and four pence should be paid upon importation for every barrel or cask of salted beef or pork containing thirty-two gallons; and one shil∣ling and three pence for every hundred weight of salted beef, called dried beef, dried neats tongues, or dried hog-meat, and so in proportion for any greater or lesser quantity. From this clause it ap∣pears, the burthen which the navigation of Great Britain incurs by the duty of salt alone is computed to amount to thirteen per centum, on those articles of commerce in which it is used; consequently the freight of all ships victualled in this kingdom must be proportionably increased: therefore it is not at all surprising, that the trade to Hamburgh, and other ports, should be carried on in foreign ships,
<PB N="26" REF="250"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> as far as the act of navigation will allow. Re∣peated complaints having been made to the go∣vernment by neutral nations, especially the Dutch, that their ships had been plundered, and their crews maltreated, by some of the English priva∣teers, the legislature resolved to provide effectually against any such outrageous practices for the future; and with this view the commons ordered a bill to be brought in, for amending and explaining an act of the twenty-ninth year of his present majesty's reign, intituled, an act for the encouragement of seamen, and more speedy and effectual manning of his majesty's navy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Regula∣tio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pect to priva∣teers.</NOTE> While the committee was employed in perusing commissions and papers relating to private ships of war, that they might be fully acquainted with the nature of the subject, a considerable number of merchants and others inhabiting the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, presented a petition to the house, alledging that the inhabitants of those islands which he in the British channel within sight of the French coast, had now, as well as in former wars, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbarked their fortunes in equipping small priva∣teers, which used to run in close with the French shore, and being disguised like fishing-boats, had not only taken a considerable number of prizes, to the great annoyance of the enemy, but also ob∣tained material intelligence of their designs, on many important occasions; that these services could not be performed by large vessels, which durst not approach so near the coast, and indeed could not appear without giving the alarm, which was communicated from place to place by appoint∣ed signals. Being informed that a bill was depend∣ing,
<PB N="27" REF="260"/>
in order to prohibit privateers of small bur∣then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> they declared that such a law, if extended to privateers equipped in those islands, would ruin such as had invested their fortunes in small pri∣vateers; and not only deprive the kingdom of the before mentioned advantages, but expose Great Britain to infinite prejudice from the small armed vessels of France, which the enemy in that case would pour abroad over the whole channel, to the great annoyance of navigation and commerce. They prayed therefore that such privateers as be∣longed to the islands of Guernsey and Jersey might be wholly excepted from the penalties contained in the bill, or that they (the petitioners) might be heard by their counsel, and be indulged with such relief as the house should judge expedient. This representation being referred to the consideration of the committee, produced divers amendments to the bill, which, at length, obtained the royal as∣sent, and contained these regulations: that, after the first day of January in the present year, no commission should be granted to a privateer in Eu∣rope under the burden of one hundred tons, the force of ten carriage guns, being three pounders or above, with forty men at the least, unless the lords of the admiralty, or persons authorised by them, should think fit to grant the same to any ship of inferior force or burthen, the owners there∣of giving such bail or security as should be pre∣scribed: that the lords of the admiralty might at any time revoke, by an order in writing under their hands, any commission granted to a privateer; this revocation being subject to an appeal to his majesty in council, whose determination should be final:
<PB N="28" REF="270"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> that, previous to the granting any commission, the persons proposing to be bound, and give security, should severally make oath of their being respec∣tively worth more money than the sum for which they were then to be bound, over and above the payment of all their just debts: that persons apply∣ing for such commissions should make application in writing, and therein set forth a particular and exact description of the vessel, specifying the bur∣then, and the number and nature of the guns on board, to what place belonging, as well as the name or names of the principal owner or owners, and the number of men: these particulars to be insert∣ed in the commission, and every commander to produce such commission to the custom-house officer, who should examine the vessel, and, finding her an∣swer the description, give a certificate thereof gra∣tis, to be deemed a necessary clearance, without which the commander should not depart: that if, after the first day of June, any captain of a priva∣teer should agree for the ransom of any neutral vessel, or the cargo, or any part thereof, after it should have been taken as prize, and in pursuance of such agreement should actually discharge such prize, he should be deemed guilty of piracy; but that, with respect to contraband merchandize, he might take it on board his own ship, with the consent of the commander of the neutral vessel, and then set her at liberty; and that no person should pur∣loin or embezzle the said merchandize before con∣demnation: that no judge, or other person belong∣ing to any court of admiral<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, should be concern∣ed in any privateer: that owners of vessels, not being under fifty, or above one hundred tons,

whose commissions are declared void, should be<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759▪</NOTE> indemnified for their loss by the public: that a court of oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery, for the tryal of offences committed within the juris∣diction of the admiralty, should be held twice a year in the Old Bailey at London, or in such other place within England as the board of admiralty should appoint: that the judge of any court of ad∣miralty, after an appeal interposed as well as be∣fore, should, at the request of the captor or claimant, issue an order for appraising the capture, when the parties do not agree upon the value, and an inventory to be taken; then exact security for the full value, and cause the capture to be delivered to the person giving such security: but should ob∣jection be made to the taking such security, the judge should, at the request of either party, order such merchandize to be entered, landed, and sold at public auction, and the produce be deposited at the Bank, or in some public securities; and in case of security being given, the judge should grant a pass in favour of the capture. Finally, the force of this act was limited to the duration of the pre∣sent war with France only.</P>
<P>This regulation very clearly demonstrated, that whatever violences might have been committed on the ships of neutral nations, they were by no means countenanced by the legislature, or the body of the people.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New laws relating to the militia.</NOTE> Every circumstance relating to the reformation of the marine must be an important object, to a nation whose wealth and power depend upon navi∣gation and commerce: but a consideration of equal weight was the establishment of the milita, which,
<PB N="30" REF="290"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> notwithstanding the repeated endeavours of the parliament, was found still incompleat, and in want of further assistance from the legislature. His ma∣jesty having, by the chancellor of the Exchequer, recommended to the house the making suitable provision for defraying the charges of the militia during the current year, the accounts of the ex∣pence already incurred by this establishment were referred to the committee of supply, who, after having duly perused them, resolved, that ninety thousand pounds should be granted on accompt, towards defraying the charges of pay and cloath∣ing for the militia, from the last day of the last year to the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty, and for re∣paying a sum advanced by the king for this service. Leave was given to bring in one bill pursuant to this resolution; and another to enforce the execu∣tion of the laws relating to the militia, remove cer∣tain difficulties, and prevent the inconveniences, by which it might be attended. So intent were the majority on both sides upon this national measure, that they not only carried both bills to the throne, where they received the royal assent; but they pre∣sented an address to the king, desiring his majesty would give directions to his lieutenants of the se∣veral counties, ridings, and places in England, to use their utmost diligence and attention for carry∣ing into execution the several acts of parliament relating to the militia.</P>
<P>By this time all the individuals that constituted the representatives of the people, except such as actually served in the army, were become very well disposed towards this institution. Those who
<PB N="31" REF="300"/>
really wished well to their country, had always ex∣erted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> themselves in its favour: and it was now likewise espoused by those who foresaw that the establishment of a national militia would enable the a—n to send the greater number of regular troops to sight the battles of G—y. Yet how zealous soever the legislature might be in pro∣moting this institution, and notwithstanding the success with which many patriots exerted their en∣deavours through different parts of the kingdom in raising and disciplining the militia, it was found not only difficult, but almost impracticable to ex∣ecute the intention of the parliament in some par∣ticular counties, where the gentlemen were indo∣lent and enervated, or in those places where they looked upon their commander with contempt. Even Middlesex itself, where the king resides, was one of the last counties in which the militia could be arrayed. In allusion to this backwardness, the preamble or first clause in one of the present acts, imported that certain counties, ridings, and places in England, had made some progress in establish∣ing the militia without compleating the same; and that in certain other counties little progress had been made therein, his majesty's lieutenants and the deputy lieutenants, and all others within such counties or districts, were therefore strictly required speedily and diligently to put these acts in execu∣tion. The truth is, some of these unwarlike com∣manders failed through ignorance and inactivity; others gave or offered commissions to such people as threw a ridicule and contempt upon the whole establishment, and consequently hindered many gentlemen of worth, spirit, and capacity, from en∣gaging in the service.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill con∣cerning post-fines.</NOTE> The next bill that fell under the cognizance of the house related to a law-transaction, and was suggested by a petition presented in the name of the sheriffs, and grantees of post-fines under the crown in England. They enume∣rated and explained the difficulties under which they laboured, in raising and collecting these fines within their respective countries; particularly when the estate conveyed by fine, was no more than a right of reversion, in which case they could not possibly levy the post-fine, unless the purchaser should obtain possession within the term of the she∣riffalty, or pay it of his own free will, as they could not distrain while the lands were in the pos∣session of the donee. They therefore proposed a method for raising these post-fines by a proper of∣ficer, to be appointed for that purpose; and prayed, that leave might be given to bring in a bill accordingly. This petition was seconded by a message from the king, importing, that his ma∣jesty, as far as his interest was concerned, gave his consent that the house might act in this affair as they should think proper. The commons, in a committee of the whole house, having taken into consideration the merits of the petition, formed several resolutions; upon which a bill was founded for the more regular and easy collecting, account∣ing for, and paying of post fines, which should be due to the crown, or to the grantees thereof under the crown, and for the ease of sheriffs in respect to
<PB N="33" REF="320"/>
the same. Before it passed into a law, however, it<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> was opposed by a petition in favour of one William Daw, a lunatic, clerk of the king's silver-office, alledging, that, should the bills pass, it would de∣prive the said Daw and his successors of an ancient see belonging to his office, on searches made for post-fines by the under-sheriffs of the several coun∣ties; therefore praying, that such provision might be made for the said lunatic as to the house should seem just and reasonable. This and divers other petitions, respecting the bill, being discussed in the committee, it underwent several amendments, and was enacted into a law; the particulars of which cannot be properly understood, without a previous explanation of this method of conveying estates: a subject obscure in itself, founded upon a seeming subterfuge of law, scarce reconcileable with the common dictates of common sense, and conse∣quently improper for the pen of an historian.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Continu∣ation and revival of certain laws.</NOTE> A committee having been appointed to inquire what laws were expired, or near expiring, and to report their opinion to the house touching the revival or continuation of these laws, they agreed to several resolutions; in consequence of which the following bills were brought in, and enacted into laws, name∣ly, an act for regulating the lastage and ballastage of the river Thames; an act for continuing the law relating to the punishment of persons going armed or disguised; an act for continuing several laws near expiring; an act concerning the admeasure∣ment of coals; and an act for the relief of debtors, with respect to the imprisonment of their persons. This last was almost totally metamorphosed by al∣terations, amendments, and additions, among which the most remarkable were these: that where more
<PB N="34" REF="330"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> creditors than one shall charge any prisoner in exe∣cution, and desire to have him detained in prison, they shall only respectively pay him each such weekly sum, not exceeding one shilling and six pence a week, as the court, at the time of his being remanded, shall direct: that if any prisoner, de∣scribed by the act, shall remain in prison three months, after being committed, any creditor may compel him to give into court, upon oath, an ac∣count of his real and personal estate, to be disposed of for the benefit of his creditors, they consenting to his being discharged. Why the humanity of this law was confined to those prisoners only, who are not charged in execution with any debt exceed∣ing one hundred pounds, cannot easily be con∣ceived. A man, who, through unavoidable mis∣fortunes, hath sunk from affluence to misery and indigence, is generally a greater object of compas∣sion than he who never knew the delicacies of life, nor ever enjoyed credit sufficient to contract debts to any considerable amount: yet the latter is by this law intitled to his discharge, or at least to a maintenance in prison; while the former is left to starve in gaol, or undergo perpetual imprisonment amidst all the horrors of misery, if he owes above one hundred pounds to a revengeful and unrelent∣ing creditor. Wherefore, in a country, the people of which justly pique themselves upon charity and benevolence, an unhappy fellow-citizen, reduced to a state of bankruptcy by unforeseen losses in trade, should be subjected to a punishment, which, of all others, must be the most grievous to a free∣born Briton, namely, the entire loss of liberty; a punishment which the most flagrant crime can hard∣ly
<PB N="35" REF="340"/>
deserve, in a nation that disclaims the torture;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> for, doubtless, perpetual imprisonment must be a torture infinitely more severe than death, because protracted through a series of years spent in misery and despair, without one glimmering ray of hope, without the most distant prospect of deliverance? Wherefore the legislature should extend its huma∣nity to those only who are the least sensible of the benefit, because the most able to struggle under misfortune? And wherefore many valuable indivi∣duals should, for no guilt of their own, be not only ruined to themselves, but lost to the community? are questions which we cannot resolve to the satis∣faction of the reader. Of all imprisoned debtors, those who are confined for large sums may be deemed the most wretched and forlorn, because they have generally fallen from a sphere of life where they had little acquaintance with necessity, and were altogether ignorant of the arts by which the severities of indigence are alleviated. On the other hand, those of the lower class of mankind, whose debts are small in proportion to the narrow∣ness of their former credit, have not the same de∣licate seelings of calamity. They are inured to hardship, and accustomed to the labour of their hands, by which, even in a prison, they can earn a subsistence. Their reverse of fortune is not so great, nor the transition so affecting. Their sensa∣tions are not delicate; nor are they, like their bet∣ters in misfortune, cut off from hope, which is the wretch's last comfort. It is the man of sentiment and sensibility who, in this situation, is overwhelm∣ed with a complication of misery and ineffable dis∣tress. The mortification of his pride, his ambi∣tion

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> blasted, his family undone, himself deprived of liberty, reduced from opulence to extreme want, from the elegancies of life to the most squalid and frightful scenes of poverty and affliction; divested of comfort, destitute of hope, and doomed to linger out a wretched being in the midst of insult, vio∣lence, riot, and uproar: these are reflections so re∣plete with horror, as to render him, in all respects, the most miserable object on the face of the earth. He, alas! though possessed of talents that might have essentially served, and even adorned society, while thus restrained in prison, and affected in mind, can exert no faculty, nor stoop to any con∣des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ension, by which the horrors of his fate might be asswaged. He scorns to execute the lowest of∣fices of menial service, particularly in attending those who are the objects of contempt or abhor∣rence: he is incapable of exercising any mechanic art, which might afford a happy though a scanty independence. Shrunk within his dismal cell, sur∣rounded by haggard poverty, and her gaunt at∣tendants, hollow-eyed famine, shivering cold, and wan disease, he wildly casts his eyes around: he sees the tender partner of his heart weeping in silent woe; he hears his helpless babes clamorous for sustenance: he feels himself the importunate cravings of human nature, which he cannot satisfy; and groans with all the complicated pangs of inter∣nal anguish, horror, and despair. These are not the fictions of idle fancy; but real pictures, drawn from nature, of which almost every prison in Eng∣land will afford but too many originals: and it would well become a prince, whose distinguishing characteristic is humanity, with a parliament famed

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bills for the im∣portation of Irish beef and tallow.</NOTE> Among other new measures, a successful attempt was made in favour of Ireland, by a bill, permitting the free importation of cattle from that kingdom for a limited time. This, however, was not car∣ried through both houses without considerable op∣position, arising from the particular interest of cer∣tain countries and districts in several parts of Great Britain, from whence petitions against the bill were transmitted to the commons. Divers artifices were also used within doors to saddle the bill with such clauses as might overcharge the scheme, and ren∣der it odious or alarming to the public: but the promoters of it, being aware of the design, con∣ducted it in such a manner as to frustrate all their views, and convey it safely to the throne, where it was enacted into a law.</P>
<P>The like success attended another effort in be∣half of our fellow-subjects of Ireland. The bill for the importation of Irish cattle was no sooner or∣dered to be brought in, than the house proceeded to take into consideration the duties then payable on the importation of tallow from the same king∣dom; and several witnesses being examined, the committee agreed to a resolution, that these duties should cease and determine for a limited time. A bill being formed accordingly, passed through both houses without opposition; though in the preced∣ing session a bill to the same purpose had miscar∣ried among the peers: a miscarriage probably owing to their being unacquainted with the senti∣ments of his majesty, as some of the duties upon
<PB N="38" REF="370"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> tallow constituted part of one of the branches ap∣propriated for the civil list revenue. This ob∣jection, however, was obviated in the case of the present bill, by the king's message to the house of commons, signifying his majesty's consent, as far as his interest was concerned in the affair. By this new act the free importation of Irish tallow was permitted for the term of five years, before the ex∣piration of which, the law, it is to be hoped, will be made perpetual. Indeed, it is not a little sur∣prising that the importation of this commodity, from one part of the British dominions to another, should have been ever encumbered with a duty equal to a prohibition, considering what a necessary article it is in so many manufactures and mechani∣cal employments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relat∣ing to Milford∣hav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE> In the month of February the commons pre∣sented an address to his majesty, requesting that he would give directions for laying before the house an account of what had been done, since the be∣ginning of last year, towards securing the harbour of Milford, in pursuance of any directions from his majesty. These accounts being perused, and the king having, by the chancellor of the Exchequer, exhorted them to make provision for fortifying the said harbour, a bill was brought in to explain, amend, and render more effectual, the act of the last session relating to this subject; and passing through both houses, received the royal assent, without opposition. By this act several engineers were added to the commissioners formerly ap∣pointed; and it was ordained, that fortifications should be erected at Peter-church-point, West∣lanyon-point, and Neyland point, as being the most
<PB N="39" REF="380"/>
proper and best situated places for fortifying the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> interior parts of the harbour. It was also enacted, that the commissioners should appoint proper secre∣taries, clerks, assistants, and other officers, for car∣rying the two acts into execution; and that an ac∣count of the application of the money should be laid before the parliament, within twenty days of the opening of every session.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill re∣straining the im∣portation of French cloths in∣to the ports of the Le∣vant.</NOTE> What next attracted the attention of the house, was an affair of the utmost importance to the com∣merce of the kingdom, which equally affected the interest of the nation, and the character of the na∣tives. In the latter end of February complaint was made to the house, that, since the commencement of the war, an infamous traffick had been set on foot, by some merchants of London, of importing French cloths into several ports of the Levant, on account of British subjects Five persons were summoned to attend the house; and the fact was fully proved, not only by their evidence, but also by some papers submitted to the house by the Tur∣key company. A bill was immediately contrived for putting a stop to this scandalous practice, re∣citing in the preamble, that such traffick was not only a manifest discouragement and prejudice to the woollen manufactures of Great Britain, but also a relief to the enemy, in consequence of which they were enabled to maintain the war against these kingdoms.</P>
<P>By this law it was enacted, That no woollen goods of the manufacture of France should, direct∣ly or indirectly, be imported into any port of the Levant, within the limits prescribed in the charter of the Turkey company, by or on the account of any member of the said company, or any subject of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Great Britain; nor should any woollen goods of the British manufacture be imported within the limits of that charter, except directly from Great Britain, by or on account of any British subject, unless the im∣porter should produce to his majesty's ambassador, or vice-consul, or other proper officer appointed by the Levant company, at the place where such goods should be imported, a certificate, upon oath, from the exporter or shipper at the last place of exportation, that the same were brought or received from Great Britain; which certificate should be attested by the British consul, or person acting as consul in his ab∣sence, residing at such last loading-port; and the ship∣per should also procure the bill of▪lading, made out upon shipping the said goods from Great Britain; and the consul should take notice in the attestation of the certificate, that the bill of lading was pro∣duced. It was moreover enacted, that all woollen goods imported, within the limits of the Levant company's charter, by or on account of any British subject, other than such as should be imported di∣rectly from Great Britain, should be deemed French property within the meaning of the act; and his majesty's ambassador, consul, or vice consul, or other proper officer appointed by the Levant com∣pany, were required to cause the said merchandize to be seized and confiscated. Other clauses im∣plied that the exporter of merchandize from Tur∣key, and the importer of them into Britain or Ire∣land, should make oath that no part of it was to their knowledge purchased with the produce, or taken in barter or exchange, for any kind of French woollen manufacture, except such as had been condemned as lawful prize: that in case the certificate should be lost or mislaid, the exporta∣tion
<PB N="41" REF="400"/>
to Turkey of goods taken from the enemy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and condemned as legal prize, should be permitted, on producing a copy of the sentence pronounced and signed by the judge, who condemned the said merchandize: that whoever might seize any raw silk, or mohair-yarn, as being unlawfully imported, should not release or abandon the same, or delay proceeding to judgment, without acquainting the Turkey company in writing of his intentions, and delivering a copy of the schedule of such seizure; and that if they should, within seven days, give or offer to give bond in the penal sum of one thousand pounds, conditioned to indemnify him against all costs and charges, in case the ship or cargo should not be declared forfeited, then such officer should, with all convenient speed, proceed to judgment, concerning the legality of the seizure. But the force of this regulation was limited to the dura∣tion of the present war with France.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks upon this law.</NOTE> It is surprising that no member from North Britain made any opposition to the clause enacting that all woollen goods imported into Turkey by British subjects, without a certificate, except those im∣ported directly from England, should be deemed French commodity, as it precludes all merchants in Scotland from the benefit of this trade, although they are capable of being members of the Turkey company. The article restricting the importation of raw silk and mohair-yarn is still more unaccount∣able, as it may easily be demonstrated that it would be for the interest of Great Britain to allow a free importation of these commodities from every part of the world.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> a number of poor people, who are unfit for any other sort of labour or industry.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill relat∣ing to the duty upon pensions.</NOTE> The next object that employed the attention of the commons was to explain and amend a law made in the last session for granting to his majesty several rates and duties upon offices and pensions. The directions specified in the former act for levying this imposition having been found inconvenient in many respects, new regulations were now esta∣blished, importing that those deductions should be paid into the hands of receivers appointed by the king for that purpose; that all sums deducted under this act should be accounted for to such re∣ceivers, and the accounts audited and passed by them, and not by the auditors of the imprests, or of the Exchequer; that all disputes relating to the collection of this duty should be finally, and in a summary way, determined by the barons of the Exchequer in England and Scotland respectively; that the commissioners of the land-tax should fix and ascertain the sum total or amount of the per∣quisites of every office and employment within their respective districts, distinct from the salary thereunto belonging, to be deducted under the said act, independently of any former valuation or assessment of the same to the land-tax; and should rate or assess all offices and employments whereof
<PB N="43" REF="420"/>
the perquisites should be found to exceed the sum<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of one hundred pounds per annum, at one shilling for every twenty thence arising; that the receivers should transmit to the commissioners in every dis∣trict where any office or employment is to be as∣sessed, an account of such offices and employ∣ments, that, upon being certified of the truth of their amount, they might be rated and assessed ac∣cordingly; that in all future assessments of the land-tax the said offices and employments should not be valued at higher rates than those at which they were assessed towards the land-tax of the thirty-first year of the present reign; that the word per∣quisite should be understood to mean such profits of offices and employments as arise from fees esta∣blished by custom or authority, and payable either by the crown or the subjects, in consideration of business done in the course of executing such of∣fices and employments; and that a commissioner pos∣sessed of any office or employment might not inter∣fere in the execution of the said act, except in what might relate to his own employment. By the four last clauses several salaries are exempted from the payment of this duty.</P>
<P>The objections made without doors to this new law were the accession of pecuniary influence to the crown, by the creation of a new office and officers; whereas this duty might have been easily collected and receiv∣ed by the commissioners of the land-tax already ap∣pointed, and the inconsistency that appeared between the fifth and seventh clauses; in the former of these, the commissioners of the land-tax were vested with the power of assessing the perquisites of every of∣fice within their respective districts, independent
<PB N="44" REF="430"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of any former valuation or assessment of the same to the land-tax; and by the latter, they are re∣stricted from assessing any office at a higher rate than that of the thirty-first year of the present reign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act relat∣ing to the duty upon plate.</NOTE> In the beginning of March petitions were of∣fered to the house by the merchants of Birming∣ham in Warwickshire and Sheffield in Yorkshire, specifying that the toy trade of these and many other towns consisted generally of articles in which gold and silver might be said to be manufactured, though in small proportion, inasmuch as the sale of them depended upon slight ornaments of gold and silver: that by a clause passed in the last ses∣sion of parliament, obliging every person who should sell goods or wares in which any gold or silver was manufactured, to take out an annual licence of forty shillings, they the petitioners were laid under great difficulties and disadvantages: that not only the first seller, but every person through whose hands the goods or wares passed to the con∣sumer, was required to take out the said licence; they therefore requested, that the house would take these hardships and inequalities into consideration, and indulge them with reasonable relief.</P>
<P>The committee, to which this affair was re∣ferred, having resolved, that this imposition was found detrimental to the toy and cutlery trade of the kingdom, the house agreed to the resolution; and a bill being prepared, under the title of "An act to amend the act, made in the last session, for repealing the duty granted by an act of the sixth year in the reign of his late majesty on silver plate, and for granting a duty on licences to be taken out
<PB N="45" REF="440"/>
by all persons dealing in gold and silver plate,"<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> was enacted into a law by the royal sanction. By this new regulation, small quantities of gold and silver plate were allowed to be sold without licence. Instead of the duty before payable upon licences, another was granted to be taken out by certain dealers in gold and silver plate, pawnbrokers, and refiners.</P>
<P>Though the purpose of the legislature in passing this new act was to favour the manufacturer of cutlery-ware and toys, it will hardly exempt any of the traders from the expence of a licence; to which, in all probability, they will rather submit, than be restricted in the nature of their dealings, or run the risque of having disputes and law-suits with excisemen, to be determined by the commis∣sioners of the excise, or annually by the commis∣sioners of appeal.</P>
<P>This affair being discussed, the house took into consideration the claims of the proprietors of lands, purchased for the better securing of his majesty's docks, ships, and stores at Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth; and for better fortifying the town of Portsmouth and citadel of Plymouth, in pur∣suance of an act passed in the last session. We have already specified the sum granted for this pur∣pose, in consequence of a resolution of the house, upon which a bill being founded, soon passed into a law, without opposition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Law re∣garding summons by the commis∣sioners of the Ex∣cise.</NOTE> The next bill, which was brought into the house, related to the summons issued by the commissioners of the excise, and justices of the peace, for the ap∣pearance of persons offending against, or for for∣feitures incurred by the laws of excise. As some
<PB N="46" REF="450"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> doubts had arisen with respect to the method of summoning in such cases, this bill, which obtained the royal assent in due course, enacted, that sum∣mons left at the house, or usual place of residence, or with the wife, child, or menial servants of the person so summoned, should be held as legal no∣tice, as well as the leaving such notice at the house, workhouse, warehouse, shop, cellar, vault, or usual place of residence of such person, directed to him by his right or assumed name; and all dealers in coffee, tea, or chocolate, were subjected to the pe∣nalty of twenty pounds as often as they should ne∣glect to attend the commissioners of excise, when summoned in this manner. This unnecessary rigour of the law enables the officers of the excise to op∣press their fellow-subjects with impunity. A sum∣moning officer, at enmity with any dealer, may leave the summons in some private part of his house or warehouse, and afterwards convey it away, with∣out the knowledge of the trader, who may never receive the least intimation of his having been summoned, until an execution is brought into his house for the penalty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambrick act.</NOTE> In the month of April, a bill was brought in for the more effectual preventing the fraudulent importation of cambricks; and while it was under deliberation, several merchants and wholesale dra∣pers of the city of London presented a petition, representing the grievances to which they and many thousands of other traders would be subjected, should the bill, as it then stood, be passed into a law. According to their request, they were heard by their counsel on the merits of this remonstrance, and some amendments were made to the bill in
<PB N="47" REF="460"/>
their favour. At length it received the royal as∣sent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and became a law to the following effect: It enacted, That no cambricks, French lawns, or linens of this kind, usually entered under the de∣nomination of cambricks, should be imported after the first day of next August, but in bales, cases, or boxes, covered with sackcloth or canvas, containing each one hundred whole pieces, or two hundred half pieces, on penalty of forfeiting the whole: that cambricks and French lawns should be im∣ported for exportation only, lodged in the king's warehouse, and delivered out under like security and restrictions as prohibited East India merchan∣dize; and, on importation, pay only the half sub∣sidy: that all cambricks and French lawns in the custody of any persons should be deposited, by the first of August, in the king's warehouses, the bonds thereupon be delivered up, and the drawback on exportation paid; yet the goods should not be delivered out again but for exportation: that cam∣bricks and French lawns exposed to sale, or found in possession of private persons, after the said day, should be forfeited, and liable to be searched for, and seized, in like manner as other prohibited and uncustomed goods are; and the offender should forfeit two hundred pounds, over and above all other penalties and forfeitures inflicted by any former act: that if any doubt should arise concern∣ing the species or quality of the goods, or the place where they were manufactured, the proof should lie on the owner: finally, that the penalty of five pounds inflicted by a former act, and pay∣able to the informer, on any person that should wear any cambrick or French lawns, should still
<PB N="48" REF="470"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> remain in force, and be recoverable, on conviction, by oath of one witness, before one justice of the peace. This rigorous law may be attended with some inconvenience, and even prove ineffectual in excluding the French manufacture, inasmuch as the fabrick of some Dutch and German lawns re∣sembles that of the French manufacture so nearly, that it is sometimes impossible to distinguish the one from the other. The only method by which they were formerly distinguished, was the dif∣ferent manner of marking and package. But the French manufacturer can easily counterseit the manner of the Dutch or Germans in these particulars, and then send his goods to some place in Holland and Flanders, from whence they may be imported into England, as the fa∣brick of these countries. Perhaps the most ef∣fectual expedient for preventing the importation of French cambricks would be the granting a proper bounty on all home-made cambricks and lawns, payable on sight of a certificate from an excise-man and two parish-officers who had seen the pieces, and measured them before they were cut from the loom.</P>
<P>The last successful bill which this session pro∣duced, was that relating to the augmentation of the salaries of the judges in his majesty's superior courts of justice. A motion having been made for an instruction to the committee of supply, to consider of the said augmentation, the chancellor of the Exchequer acquainted the house that this augmentation was recommended to them by his majesty. Nevertheless, the motion was opposed, and a warm debate ensued. At length, however,
<PB N="49" REF="480"/>
being carried in the affirmative, the committee<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> agreed to certain resolutions, on which a bill was founded. While it remained under discussion, a motion was made for an instruction to the com∣mittee, that they should have power to receive a clause or clauses for restraining the judges, compre∣hended within the provisions of the bill, from re∣ceiving any fee, gift, present, or entertainment, from any city, town, borough, or corporation, or from any sheriff, gaoler, or other officer, upon their several respective circuits, and from taking any gratuity from any office or officer of any of the courts of law. Another motion was made for a clause restraining such judges, barons, and justices, as were comprehended within the provisions of the bill, from interfering, otherwise than by giving their own votes, in any election of members to serve in parliament; but both these proposals, being put to the vote, were carried in the negative. These two motions being over-ruled by the majo∣rity, the bill underwent some amendments; and, having passed through both houses in the ordinary course, was enacted into a law by the royal sanction. With respect to the import of this act, it is no other than the establishment of the several stamp-duties, applied to the augmentation; and the appropria∣tion of their produce in such a manner, that the crown cannot alter the application of the sums thus granted in parliament. But, on this occasion, no attempt was made in favour of the indepen∣dency of the judges, which seems to have been in∣vaded by a late interpretation of, or rather by a deviation from, the act of settlement: in which it is expressly ordained, that the commissions of the
<PB N="50" REF="490"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> judges should continue in force <HI>quamdiu se bene gesserint;</HI> that their salaries should be fixed, and none of them removeable but by an address of both houses of parliament. It was then, without all doubt, the intention of the legislature, that every judge should enjoy his office during life, un∣less convicted by legal trial of some misbehaviour, or unless both houses of parliament should concur in desiring his removal: but the doctrine now adopted imports, that no commission can continue in force longer than the life of the king by whom it was granted; that therefore the commissions of the judges must be renewed by a new king at his accession, who should have it in his power to em∣ploy either those whom he finds acting as judges at his accession, or confer their offices on others, with no other restraint than that the condition of the new commissions should be <HI>quamdiu se bene ges∣serint.</HI> Thus the office of a judge is rendered more precarious, and the influence of the crown receives a considerable reinforcement.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unsuc∣cessful bill con∣cerning methods for man∣ning the navy.</NOTE> Among the bills that miscarried in the course of this session, we may number a second attempt to carry into execution the scheme which was offered last year for the more effectual manning the navy, preventing desertion, and relieving and encou∣raging the seamen of Great Britain. A bill was accordingly brought in, couched in nearly the same terms which had been rejected in the last session; and it was supported by a considerable number of members, animated with a true spirit of patriotism: but to the trading part of the nation it appeared one of those plausible projects, which, though agreeable in speculation, can never be reduced into
<PB N="51" REF="500"/>
practice without a concomitancy of greater evils<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> than those they were intended to remove. While the bill remained under the consideration of the house, petitions were presented against it by the merchants of Bristol, Scarborough, Whitby, King∣ston upon Hull, and Lancaster, representing, That, by such a law, the trade of the kingdom, which is the nursery and support of seamen at all times, and that spirit of equipping private ships of war, which had been of distinguished service to the nation, would be laid under such difficulties as might cause a great stagnation in the former, and a total suppres∣sion of the latter; the bill therefore would be high∣ly prejudicial to the marine of the kingdom, and altogether ineffectual for the purposes intended. A great number of books and papers, relating to trading ships and vessels, as well as to seamen, and other persons protected or pressed into the navy, and to expences occasioned by pressing men into the navy, were examined in a committee of the whole house, and the bill was improved with many amendments: nay, after it was printed and en∣grossed, several clauses were added by way of ryder: yet still the experiment seemed dangerous. The motion for its being passed was violently op∣posed; warm debates ensued; they were adjourn∣ed, and resumed; and the arguments against the bill appeared at length in such a striking light, that, when the question was put, the majority de∣clared for the negative.</P>
<P>The regulations which had been made in par∣liament during the twenty-sixth, the twenty-eighth, and thirtieth years of the present reign, for the pre∣servation of the public roads, being attended with

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> some inconveniences in certain parts of the king∣dom, petitions were brought from some counties<NOTE PLACE="marg">Miscar∣riage of a bill re∣lating to waggons and car∣riages.</NOTE> in Wales, as well as from the freeholders of Here∣fordshire, the farmers of Middlesex, and others, enu∣merating the difficulties attending the use of broad wheels in one case, and the limitation of horses used in drawing carriages with narrow wheels in the other. The matter of these remonstrances was considered in a committee of the whole house, which resolved, that the weight to be carried by all waggons and carts travelling on the turnpike roads should be limited. On this resolution a bill was framed for amending and reducing into one act of parliament the three acts before-mentioned, for the preservation of the public highways: but some objections being started, and a petition inter∣posed by the land owners of Suffolk and Norfolk, alledging, that the bill, if passed into a law, would render it impossible to bring fresh provisions from those counties to London, as the supply depended absolutely upon the quickness of conveyance; the further consideration of it was postponed to a longer day, and never resumed in the sequel: so that the attempt miscarried.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of the in∣solvent debtors.</NOTE> Of all the subjects which, in the course of this session, fell under the cognizance of parliament, there was none that more interested the humanity or challenged the redress of the legislature, than did the case of the poor insolvent debtors, who lan∣guished under all the miseries of indigence and im∣prisonment. In the month of February a petition was offered to the commons in behalf of bank∣rupts, who represented, That having scrupulously conformed to the laws made concerning bank∣ruptcy,
<PB N="53" REF="520"/>
by surrendering their all upon oath for the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> benefit of their creditors, they had nevertheless been refused their certificates, without any proba∣bility of relief; that, by this cruel refusal, many bankrupts had been obliged to abscond, while others were immured in prison, and these unhappy sufferers groaned under the particular hardship of being excluded from the benefit of laws occasional∣ly made for the relief of insolvent debtors; that the power vested in creditors of refusing certifi∣cates to their bankrupts, was, as the petitioners conceived, founded upon a presumption that such power would be tenderly exercised, and never but in notorious cases; but the great increase in the number of bankrupts within two years past, and the small proportion of those who had been able to obtain their certificates, seemed to demonstrate, that the power had been used for cruel and unjust purposes, contrary to the intention of the legisla∣ture: that as the greater part of the petitioners, and their fellow-sufferers, must inevitably and speedily perish, with their distressed families, unless seasonably relieved by the interposition of parlia∣ment, they implored the compassion of the house, from which they hoped immediate favour and re∣lief. This petition was accompanied with a printed case, explaining the nature of the laws relating to bankrupts, and pointing out their defects in point of policy as well as humanity; but little regard was seemingly payed to either remonstrance. Other petitions, however, being presented by insolvent debtors, imprisoned in different gaols within the kingdom, leave was given to bring in a bill for
<PB N="54" REF="530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759</NOTE> their relief, and a committee appointed to examine the laws relating to bankruptcy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of captain Walker.</NOTE> Among other petitionary remonstrances on this subject, the members were separately presented with the printed case of captain George Walker, a prisoner in the gaol of the King's Bench, who had been declared a bankrupt, and complained, that he had been subjected to some flagrant acts of injus∣tice and oppression. The case contained such ex∣traordinary allegations, and the captain's character was so remarkably fair and interesting, that the committee, which were impowered to send for per∣sons, papers, and records, resolved to inquire into the particulars of his misfortune. A motion was made and agreed to, that the marshal of the prison should bring the captain before the committee, and the speaker's warrant was issued accordingly. The prisoner was produced, and examined at se∣veral sittings; and some of the members expressed a laudable eagerness to do him justice: but his an∣tagonists were very powerful, and left no stone un∣turned to frustrate the purpose of the inquiry, which was dropped▪ of course at the end of the session. Thus the unfortunate captain Walker, who had, in the late war, remarkably distinguished himself at sea by his courage and conduct, repeat∣edly signalized against the enemies of his country, was sent back, without redress, to the gloomy mansions of a gaol, where he had already pined for several years, useless to himself, and lost to the community, while he might have been profitably employed in retrieving his own fortune, and exert∣ing his talents for the general advantage of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="540"/>
While this affair was in agitation, the bill for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the relief of insolvent debtors was prepared, print∣ed, and read a second time; but, when the mo∣tion was made for its being committed, a debate arose, and this was adjourned from time to time till the end of the session.</P>
<P>In the mean time the committee continued to deliberate upon the laws relating to bankruptcy; and in the beginning of June reported their reso∣lution to the house, that, in their opinion, some amendments might be made to the laws concern∣ing bankruptcy, to the advantage of creditors, and the relief of insolvents. Such was the notice vouch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>afed to the cries of many British subjects, de∣prived of liberty, and destitute of the common ne∣cessaries of life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks upon the laws re∣lating to bank∣ruptcy.</NOTE> It would engage us in a long digressive discus∣sion, were we to inquire how the spirit of the laws in England, so famed for lenity, has been exaspe∣rated into such severity against insolvent debtors; and why, among a people so distinguished for ge∣nerosity and compassion, the gaols should be more filled with prisoners than they are in any other part of Christendom. Perhaps both these deviations from a general character, are violent efforts of a wary legislature made in behalf of trade, which cannot be too much cherished in a nation that principally depends upon commerce. The ques∣tion is, whether this laudable aim may not be more effectually accomplished, with subjecting indivi∣duals to oppression, arising from the cruelty and revenge of one another. As the laws are mo∣delled at present, it cannot be denied that the debtor, in some cases, lies in a peculiar manner at
<PB N="56" REF="550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the mercy of his creditor. By the original and common law of England, no man could be impri∣soned for debt. The plaintiff, in any civil action, could have no execution upon his judgment against either the body or the lands of the de∣fendant: even with respect to his goods and chat∣tels, which were subject to execution, he was obliged to leave him such articles as were necessary for agriculture. But, in process of time, this in∣dulgence being found prejudicial to commerce, a law was enacted, in the reign of the first Edward, allowing execution on the person of the debtor, provided his goods and chattels were not sufficient to pay the debt which he had contracted. This law was still attended with a very obvious inconve∣nience. The debtor, who possessed an estate in lands, was tempted to secrete his moveable ef∣fects, and live in concealment on the produce of his lands, while the sheriff connived at his retire∣ment.</P>
<P>To remove this evil, a second statute was enacted in the same reign, granting immediate execution against the body, lands, and goods of the debtor; yet his effects could not be sold for the benefit of his cre∣ditor till the expiration of three months, during which he himself could dispose of them for ready money, in order to discharge his incumbrances. If the creditor was not satisfied in this manner, he continued in possession of the debtor's lands, and detained the debtor himself in prison, where he was obliged to supply him with bread and water for his support, until the debt was discharged. Other se∣vere regulations were made in the sequel, particu∣larly in the reign of the third Edward, which gave
<PB N="57" REF="560"/>
rise to the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> indeed rendered the preceding laws, called statute-merchant, and statute-staple, altogether unnecessa∣ry. Though the liberty of the subject, and the se∣curity of the landholder, were thus▪ in some mea∣sure, sacrificed to the advantage of commerce, an imprisoned debtor was not left entirely at the mercy of an inexorable creditor. If he made all the sa∣tisfaction in his power, and could shew that his insolvency was owing to real misfortunes, the court of chancery interposed on his petition, and actually ordered him to be discharged from prison, when no good reason for detaining him could be assigned. This interposition, which seems naturally to belong to a court of equity, constituted with a view to mitigate the rigour of the common law, ceased in all probability after the restoration of the second Charles, and of consequence the prisons were filled with debtors. Then the legislature charged them∣selves with the extension of a power, which perhaps a chancellor no longer thought himself safe in ex∣ercising; and in the year one thousand six hundred and seventy, passed the first act for the relief of in∣solvent debtors, granted a release to all prisoners for debt, without distinction or enquiry. By this general indulgence, which has even in a great mea∣sure continued in all subsequent acts of the same kind, the lenity of the parliament may be some∣times misapplied, in as much as insolvency is often criminal, arising from profligacy and extravagance, which deserve to be severely punished. Yet, even for this species of insolvency, perpetual imprison∣ment, aggravated by the miseries of extreme indi∣gence, and the danger of perishing through famine,
<PB N="58" REF="570"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> may be deemed a punishment too severe. How cruel then must it be to leave the most innocent bankrupt exposed to this punishment, from the re∣venge or sinister design of a merciless creditor; a creditor, by whose fraud perhaps the prisoner be∣came a bankrupt, and by whose craft he is de∣tained in gaol, lest by his discharge from prison, he should be enabled to seek that redress in chancery, to which he is intitled on a fair account! The se∣verity of the law was certainly intended against fraudulent bankrupts only; and the statute of bankruptcy is, doubtless, favourable to insolvents, as it discharges from all former debts those who ob∣tain their certificates. As British subjects they are surely intitled to the same indulgence which is granted to other insolvents. They were always in∣cluded in every act passed for the relief of insolvent debtors, till the sixth year of George I. when they were first excepted from this benefit. By a law enacted in the reign of queen Anne, relating to bankruptcy, any creditor was at liberty to object to the confirmation of the bankrupt's certificate; but the chancellor had power to judge whether the objection was frivolous or well founded: yet, by a later act, the chancellor is obliged to confirm the certificate, if it is agreeable to four-fifths in number and value of the creditors; whereas he cannot con∣firmit, should it be opposed, even without any reason assigned, by one creditor to whom the greatest part of the debt is owing. It might therefore deserve the consideration of parliament, whether, in ex∣tending their clemency to the poor, it should not be equally diffused to bankrupts and other insol∣vents; whether proper distinction ought not to be
<PB N="59" REF="580"/>
made between the innocent bankrupt, who fails<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> through misfortunes in trade, and him who be∣comes insolvent from fraud or profligacy; and finally, whether the enquiry and trial of all such cases would not properly fall within the pro∣vince of chancery, a tribunal instituted for the mitigation of common law.</P>
<P>The house of commons seems to have been deter∣mined on another measure, which, however, does not admit of explanation. An order was made in the month of February, that leave should be given to bring in a bill to explain, amend, and render effectual so much of an act, passed in the thirteenth year of George II. against the excessive increase of horse-races, and deceitful gaming, as related to that in∣crease. The bill was accordingly presented, read, and printed, ordered to be committed to a commit∣tee of the whole house; but the order was delayed from time to time till the end of the session.</P>
<P>Some progress was likewise made in another af∣fair of greater consequence to the community.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commit∣tee for taking in∣to consi∣deration the state of the poor in England and Wales.</NOTE> A committee was appointed in the month of March, to take into consideration the state of the poor in England, as well as the laws enacted for their maintenance. The clerks of the peace be∣longing to all the counties, cities, and towns in England and Wales, were ordered to transmit, for the perusal of the house, an account of the annual expence of passing vagrants through their respec∣tive divisions and districts for four years; and the committee began to deliberate on this important subject. In the latter end of May the house was made acquainted with their resolutions, importing, that the present method of relieving the poor in
<PB N="60" REF="590"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the respective parishes, where no workhouses have been provided for their reception and employment, are, in general, very burthensome to the inhabi∣tants, and tend to render the poor miserable to themselves, and useless to the community: that the present method of giving money out of the paro∣chial rates, to persons capable of labour, in order to prevent them from claiming an entire subsist∣ence for themselves and their families, is contrary to the spirit and intention of the laws for the relief of the poor, is a dangerous power in the hands of parochial officers, a misapplication of the public money, and a great encouragement to idleness and intemperance: that the employment of the poor, under proper direction and management, in such works and manufactures as are suited to their res∣pective capacities, would be of great utility to the public: that settling the poor in workhouses, to be provided in the several counties and ridings in England and Wales, under the direction and ma∣nagement of governors and trustees to be appointed for that purpose, would be the most effectual me∣thod of relieving such poor persons, as by age, in∣firmities, or diseases, are rendered incapable of sup∣porting themselves by their labour; of employing the able and industrious, reforming the idle and pro∣fligate, and of educating poor children in religion and industry: that the poor in such workhouses, would be better regulated and maintained, and ma∣naged with more advantage to the public, by guar∣dians, governors, or trustees, to be specially ap∣pointed, or chosen for that purpose, and incorpo∣rated with such powers, and under such restrictions, as the legislature should deem proper, than by
<PB N="61" REF="600"/>
the annual parochial officers: that erecting work∣houses<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> upon waste lands, and appropriating a cer∣tain quantity of such lands to be cultivated, in or∣der to produce provisions for the poor in the said houses, would not only be a means of instructing and employing many of the said poor in agricul∣ture, but lessen the expence of the public: that controversies and law-suits, concerning the settle∣ments of poor persons, occasioned a very great, and, in general, an useless expence to the public, amounting to many thousand pounds per annum; and that often more money is expended in ascertain∣ing such settlements, by each of the contending pa∣rishes, than would be sufficient to maintain the pau∣pers: that should workhouses be established for the general reception of the poor, in the respective counties and ridings of England, the laws relating to the settlements of the poor, and the passing of vagrants, might be repealed: that while the pre∣sent laws relating to the poor subsist, the com∣pelling parish officers to grant certificates to the poor, would, in all probability, prevent the hard∣ships they now suffer, in being debarred gaining their livelihood, where they can do it most usefully to themselves and the public.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the resolu∣tions of the com∣mittee.</NOTE> From these sensible resolutions, the reader may conceive some idea of the misconduct that attends the management of the poor in England, as well as of the grievous burthens intailed upon the people by the present laws, which constitute this branch of the legislature.

While the committee deliberated upon this affair, leave was given to prepare a bill for preventing tenants, un∣der a certain yearly rent, from gaining settlements in any particular parish, by being there rated in any land-tax assessment, and paying for the land∣lord the money so charged. This order was after∣wards discharged; and another bill brought in to prevent any person from gaining a settlement, by being rated by virtue of an act of parliament for granting any aid to his majesty, by a land-tax, and paying the same. The bill was accordingly pre∣sented, read, committed, and passed the lower house; but among the lords it miscarried. It can never be expected that the poor will be managed with oeconomy and integrity, while the execution of the laws relating to their maintenance is left in the hands of low tradesmen, who derive private advantage from supplying them with necessaries, and often favour the imposition of one another with the most scandalous collusion. This is an evil which will never be remedied, until persons of in∣dependent fortune, and unblemished integrity, ac∣tuated by a spirit of true patriotism, shall rescue their fellow-citizens from the power of such inte∣rested miscreants, by taking the poor into their own management and protection. Instead of multiply∣ing laws with respect to the settlement and ma∣nagement of the poor, which serve only to puzzle and perplex the parish and peace officers, it would become the sagacity of the legislature to take some effectual precautions to prevent the increase of pau∣pers and vagrants, which is become an intolerable nusance to the commonwealth. Towards this sa∣lutary

end, surely nothing would more contribute<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> than a reformation of the police, that would abo∣lish those infamous places of entertainment, which swarm in every corner of the metropolis, seducing people of all ranks to extravagance, profligacy, and ruin; that would restrict within due bounds the number of public houses, which are augmented to an enormous degree, affording so many asylums for riot and debauchery, and corrupting the morals of the common people to such a pitch of licentious indecency, as must be a reproach to every civilized nation. Let it not be affirmed, to the disgrace of Great Britain, that such receptacles of vice and im∣punity subsist under the connivance of the g—t, according to the narrow views and confined specu∣lation of those shallow politicians, who imagine that the revenue is increased in proportion to the quan∣tity of strong liquors consumed in such infamous recesses of intemperance. Were this, in reality, the case, that ad—n would deserve to be branded with eternal infamy, which could sacrifice, to such a base consideration, the health, the lives, and the morals of their fellow-creatures: but nothing can be more fallacious than the supposition, that the revenue of any government can be increased by the augmented intemperance of the people; for intemperance is the bane of industry, as well as of population; and what the government gains in the articles of the duty on malt, and the excise upon li∣quors, will always be greatly over balanced by the loss in other articles, arising from the diminution of hands, and the neglect of labour</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> this session, the commons deliberated on other im∣portant subjects, which, however, were not finally<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inquiry touching weights and mea∣sures.</NOTE> discussed. In the beginning of the session, a com∣mittee being appointed to resume the inquiry touching the regulation of weights and measures, a subject we have mentioned in the history of the preceding session, the box which contained a Troy pound weight, locked up by order of the house, was again produced by the clerk in whose custody it had been deposited. This affair being carefully investigated, the committee agreed to fourteen <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the curiosity of the reader may be interested in these resolutions, we shall here insert them for his satis∣faction. The committee re∣solved, that the ell ought to contain one yard and one quarter, according to the yard mentioned in the third reso∣lution of the former commit∣tee upon the subject of weights and measures: that the pole, or perch, should contain in length five such yards and a half; the furlong two hun∣dred and twenty; and the mile one thousand seven hun∣dred and sixty: that the su∣perficial perch should contain thirty square yards and a quarter; the rood one thou∣sand two hundred and ten; and the acre four thousand eight hundred and forty: that, according to the fourth, fifth, and sixth resolutions of the former committee, upon the subject of weights and measures, agreed to by the house on the second day of June in the preceding year, the quart ought to contain seventy cubical inches and one half; the pint thirty-five and one quarter; the peck five hundred and sixty-four; and the bushel two thousand two hundred and fifty six. That the several parts of the pound, mentioned in the eighth reso∣lution of the former com∣mittee, examined and adjusted in presence of this committee, viz. the half pound or six ounces▪ quarter of a pound or three ounces, two ounces, one ounce, two half ounces, the five penny weight, three penny weight, two penny weight, and one penny weight, the twelve grains, six grains, three grains, two grains, and two of one grain each, ought to be the models of the several parts of the said pound, and to be used for sizing or ad∣justing weights for the future. That all weights exceeding a pound should be of brass, cop∣per, bell metal, or cast iron; and that all those of cast iron should be made in the form▪ and with a handle of ham∣mered iron, such as the pat∣tern herewith produced, hav∣ing the mark of the weight cast in the iron; and all weights of a pound, or under, should be of gold, silver, brass, copper, or bell-metal. That all weights of cast iron should have the initial letters of the name of the maker upon the upper bar of the handle; and all other weights should have the same, together with the mark of the weight, accord∣ing to this stardard, upon some convenient part thereof. That the yard, mentioned in the second resolution of the former committee, upon the subject of weights and mea∣sures, agreed to by the house in the last session, being the standard of length, and the pound, mentioned in the eighth resolution, being the standard of weight, ought to be deposited in the court of the receipt of the Exchequer, and there safely kept, under the seals of the chancellor of the said Exchequer, and of the chief baron, and the seal of office of the chamberlain of the Exchequer, and not to be opened but by the order and in the presence of the chancellor of the Exchequer, and chief baron, for the time being. That the most effec∣tual means to ascertain uni∣formity in measures of length and weight, to be used throughout the realm, would be to appoint certain persons, at one particular office, with clerks and workmen under them, for the purpose only of sizing and adjusting, for the use of the subjects, all mea∣sures of length and all weights, being parts, multiples, or cer∣tain proportions of the stan∣dards to be used for the fu∣ture. That a model or pat∣tern of the said standard yard, mentioned in the second reso∣lution of the former commit∣tee, and now in custody of the clerk of the house, and a model or pattern of the stan∣dard pound, mentioned in the eighth resolution of that com∣mittee, together with models or patterns of the parts of the said pound, now presented to the house, and also of the multiples of the said pound, mentioned in this report, (when the same are adjusted) should be kept in the said of∣fice, in custody of the said per∣sons to be appointed for sizing weights and measures, under the seal of the chief baron of the Exchequer for the time being, to be opened only by order of the said chief baron,
in his presence, or the pre∣sence of one of the barons of the Exchequer, on the appli∣cation of the said persons for the purpose of correcting and adjusting, as occasion should require, the patterns or mo∣dels used at the said office, for sizing measures of length and weight, delivered out to the subjects. That models or patterns of the said standard yard, and standard pound aforesaid, and also models or patterns of the parts and mul∣tiples aforesaid of the said pound, should be lodged in the said office for the sizing of such measures of length or weight, as, being parts, mul∣tiples, or proportions of the said standards, should hereafter be required by any of his ma∣jesty's subjects. That all mea∣sures of length and weight▪ sized at the said office, should be marked in some convenient part thereof with such marks as should be thought expe∣dient, to shew the identity of the measures and weights sized at the said office, and to dis∣cover any frauds that may be committed therein. That the said office should be kept with∣in a convenient distance of the court of Exchequer at Westminster; and that all measures of length and weight, within a certain distance of London, should be corrected and re a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ized, as occasion should require, at the said office. That, in order to in∣force uniformity in weights and measures, to be used for the future, all persons ap∣pointed by the crown to act as justices of the peace, in any county, city, or town corporate, being respectively counties within themselves, throughout the realm, should be impowered to hear and de∣termine, and put the law in execution, in respect to weights and measures only, without any of them being obliged to sue out a <HI>dedimus,</HI> or to act in any other matter; and the said commissioners should be impowered to sue, imprison, inflict, or mitigate, such pe∣nalties as should be thought proper; and have such other authorities as should be ne∣cessary for compelling the use of weights and measures, a∣greeable to the foresaid stan∣dards. That models or pat∣terns of the said standard yard and pound, and of the parts and multiples thereof, before mentioned, should be distri∣buted in each county, in such a manner as to be readily used for evidence, in all cases where measures and weights should be questioned before the said commissioners, and for adjust∣ing the same in a proper man∣ner.</NOTE> resolutions, upon which a future law may possibly

Resoluti∣onstouch∣ing the Found∣ling-hos∣pital.</NOTE> The house of commons, among other articles of domestic oeconomy, bestowed some attention on the hospital for foundlings, which was now, more than ever, become a matter of national considera∣tion. The accounts relating to this charity having been demanded, and subjected to the inspection of the members, were, together with the king's re∣commendation, referred to the committee of sup∣ply, where they produced the resolutions which we have already specified among the other grants of the year. The house afterwards resolved itself into a committee, to deliberate on the state of the hospital, and examine its accounts. On the third day of May their resolutions were reported to the following effect: That the appointing, by the go∣vernors and guardians of the said hospital, places in the several counties, ridings, or divisions in this kingdom, for the first reception of exposed and deserted yound children, would be attended with many evil consequences; and that the conveying of children from the country to the said hospital is attended with many evil consequences, and ought to be prevented. A bill was ordered to be brought in, founded upon this last resolution; but never presented, therefore the enquiry produced no effect.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the institution of this charity, for the support of which great sums are yearly le∣vied
<PB N="68" REF="670"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> on the publick, it does not appear that the bills of mortality, respecting new-born children, are decreased, nor the shocking crime of insant murder rendered less frequent than heretofore. It may therefore be not improperly stiled an heavy addi∣tional tax for the propagation of bastardy, and the encouragement of idleness, among the common people; besides the tendency it has to extinguish the feelings of the heart, and dissolve those family∣ties of blood by which the charities are connected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Order re∣lating to the gold and silver coin.</NOTE> In the month of March leave was given to bring in a bill for the more effectual preventing of the melting down and exporting the gold and silver coin of the kingdom, and the persons were nomi∣nated to prepare it; but the bill never appeared, and no further inquiry was made about the matter. Perhaps it was supposed that such a measure might be thought an incroachment on the prerogative of the crown, which hath always exercised the power of fixing the standard and regulating the currency of the coin. Perhaps such a step was deferred on account of the war, during which a great quantity of gold and silver is necessarily exported to the continent, for the support of the allies and armies in the pay of Great Britain. The legislature, how∣ever, would do well to consider this eternal maxim in computation, that when a greater quantity of bullion is exported, in waste, than can be replaced by commerce, the nation must be hastening to a state of insolvency. If four millions are sent an∣nually to the continent, from whence none returns, and the whole yearly profit arising to Great Britain from the ballance of her trade does not exceed three millions, it is very plain, that the nation mus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

become the poorer for this drain, at the rate of one<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> million per year, and all the advantage that might be gained by one year's employment of this sum in trade and manufacture. The inserence may perhaps appear more plain, from the comparison of a cistern furnished with two pipes, one of which discharges four gallons of the contents, while the other replaces no more than three: at this rate, the waste being greater than the supply, in the proportion of four to three, the reservoir must be soon run to the bottom.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Messages from the king to the par∣liament.</NOTE> Over and above these proceedings in this session of parliament, it may not be unnecessary to men∣tion several messages which were sent by the king to the house of commons. That relating to the vote of credit we have already specified in our ac∣count of the supply. On the twenty-sixth day of April the chancellor of the Exchequer presented to the house two messages, signed by his majesty; one in favour of his subjects in North America, and the other in behalf of the East India company: the former recommending to their consideration the zeal and vigour with which his faithful subjects in North America had exerted themselves, in de∣fence of his just rights and possessions; desiring he might be enabled to give them a proper compen∣sation for the expences incurred by the respective provinces in levying, cloathing, and paying the troops raised in that country, according as the active vigour and strenuous efforts of the several colonies should appear to merit. In the latter, he desired the house would impower him to assist the East India company in defraying the expence of a military force in the East Indies, to be maintained

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> by them in lieu of a battalion of regular troops withdrawn from thence, and returned to Ireland. Both these messages were referred to the commit∣tee of supply, and produced the resolutions upon each subject, which we have already explained.</P>
<P>The message relating to a projected invasion by the enemies of Great Britain, we shail particularize in its proper place, when we come to record the circumstances and miscarriage of that design. In the mean time, it may not be improper to observe, that the thanks of the house of commons were voted and given to admiral Boscawen and major∣general Amherst, for the services they had done their king and country in North America; and the same compliment was payed to admiral Osborne, for the success of his cruize in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> closed.</NOTE> The session was closed on the second day of June with a speech to both houses, from the commis∣sioners appointed by his majesty for that purpose. In this harangue the parliament was given to un∣derstand, that the king approved of their conduct, and returned them his thanks for their condescen∣sion; that the hopes he had conceived of their surmounting the difficulties which lay in their way, were founded on the wisdom, zeal, and affection of so good a parliament; and that his expectations were fuily answered: that they had considered the war in all its parts, and, notwithstanding its long continuance, through the obstinacy of the enemy, had made such provision for the many different operations, as ought to convince the adversaries of Great Britain, that it would be for their interest, as well as for the ease and relief of all Europe, to em∣brace equitable and honourable terms of accom∣modation.
<PB N="71" REF="700"/>
They were told, that, by their assist∣ance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the combined army in Germany had been compleated; powerful squadrons, as well as nu∣merous bodies of land-forces, were employed in America, in order to maintain the British rights and possessions, and annoy the enemy in the most sensible manner in that country: that, as France was making considerable preparations in her dif∣ferent ports, he had taken care to put his fleet at home in the best condition, both of strength and situation, to guard against and repel any attempts that might be meditated against his kingdoms: that all his measures had been directed to assert the honour of his crown; to preserye the essential in∣terests of his faithful subjects; to support the cause of the protestant religion, and public liberty; he therefore trusted, that the uprightness of his inten∣tions would draw down the blessing of heaven upon his endeavours. He expressed his hope, that the precautions they had taken to prevent and correct the excesies of the privateers, would produce the desired effect: a consideration which the king had much at heart; for, though sensible of the utility of that service, when under proper regulations, he was determined to do his utmost to prevent any injuries or hardships which might be sustained by the subjects of neutral powers, as far as might be practicable and consistent with his majesty's just right to hinder the trade of his enemies from being collusively and fraudulently covered. He not only thanked the commons, but applauded the firmness and vigour with which they had acted, as well as their prudence in judging, that, notwithstanding the present burdens, the making ample provision
present burdens, the making ample provision
<PB N="72" REF="710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> for carrying on the war was the most probable means to bring it to an honourable and happy con∣clusion. He assured them, that no attention should be wanting, on his part, for the faithful application of what had been granted. They were informed, he had nothing further to desire, but that they would carry down the same good dispositions, and propagate them in their several counties, which they had shewn in their proceedings during the ses∣sion. These declarations being pronounced, the parliament was prorogued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirit of the people at this juncture.</NOTE> The people of England, provoked on one hand by the intrigues, the hostilities, and menaces of France, and animated on the other by the pride of triumph and success, which never fails to reconcile them to difficulties, howsoever great, and expence, however enormous, at this period breathed nothing but war, and discoursed about nothing but new plans of conquest. We have seen how liberally the parliament bestowed the nation's money; and the acquiescence of the subjects in general under the additional burdens which had been imposed, ap∣peared in the remarkable eagerness with which they embarked in the subscription planned by the legi∣slature, in the vigorous assistance they contributed towards manning the navy, recruiting the army, and levying additional forces; and the warlike spi∣rit which began to diffuse itself through all ranks of the people. This was a spirit which the m—y carefully cherished and cultivated, for the support of the war, which, it must be owned, was prose∣cuted with an ardour and efficacy peculiar to the present administration. True it is, the German war had been for some time adopted as an object of im∣portance
<PB N="73" REF="720"/>
by the British counsels, and a resolution was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> taken to maintain it without flinching: at the same time it must be allowed, that this consideration had not hitherto weakened the attention of the m—y to the operations in America, where alone the war may be said to have been carried on and prosecuted on British principles, so as to distress the enemy in their most tender part, and at the same time acquire the most substantial advantage to the subjects of Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions for war.</NOTE> For these two purposes, every preparation was made that sagacity could suggest, or vigour exe∣cute. The navy was repaired and augmented, and in order to man the different squadrons, the ex∣pedient of pressing, that disgrace to a British ad∣ministration, was practised both by land and water with extraordinary rigour and vivacity. A pro∣clamation was issued, offering a considerable bounty for every seaman and even landman that should, by a certain day, enter voluntarily in the service. As an additional encouragement to this class of people, the king promised his pardon to all seamen, who had deserted from the respective ships to which they belonged, provided they should return to their duty by the third day of July; but at the same time he declared, that those who should neg∣lect this opportunity at a time when their country so-much required their service, would, upon being apprehended, incur the penalty of a court-martial, and, if convicted, be deemed unfit objects of the royal mercy. All justices of the peace, mayors, and magistrates of corporations throughout Great Britain, were commanded to make particular search for straggling seamen fit for the service, and to send all that should be found to the nearest sea-port, that they might be sent on board by the sea-officer there

New regiments were raised on his majes∣ty's promise, that every man should be intitled to his discharge at the end of three years, and the premiums for inlisting were increased.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounties given to volun∣teers.</NOTE> Over and above these indulgencies, considerable bounties were offered and given by cities, towns, corporations, and even by individuals, so univer∣sally were the people possessed with a spirit of chi∣valry and adventure. The example was set by the metropolis, where the common-council resolved, that voluntary subscriptions should be received in the chamber of London, to be appropriated as bounty-money to such persons as should engage in his majesty's service. The city subscribed a consi∣siderable sum for that purpose; and a committee of aldermen and commoners was appointed to attend at Guildhall, to receive and apply the subscrip∣tions. As a further encouragement to volunteers, they moreover resolved, that every person so en∣tering should be intitled to the freedom of the ci∣ty, at the expiration of three years, or sooner, if the war should be brought to a conclusion. These resolutions being communicated to the king, he was pleased to signify his approbation, and return his thanks to the city, in a letter from the secretary of state to the lord-mayor. Large sums were im∣mediately subscribed by different companies, and some persons; and in imitation of the capital, bounties were offered by many different communi∣ties in every quarter of the united kingdom. At the same time such care and diligence were used in disciplining the militia, that, before the close of the
<PB N="75" REF="740"/>
year, the greater part of those truly constitutional<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> battalions rivalled the regular troops in the perfec∣tion of their exercise, and seemed to be in all res∣pects as fit for actual service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the prin∣cess of Orange, and of the princess Elizabeth Caroline.</NOTE> Before we proceed to record the transactions of the campaign that succeeded these preparations, we shall take notice of some domestic events, which, though not very important in themselves, may nevertheless claim a place in the History of England. In the beginning of the year, the court of London was overwhelmed with affliction at the death of the princess dowager of Orange and Nas∣sau, gouvernante of the United Provinces in the minority of her son the present stadtholder. She was the eldest daughter of his Britannic majesty, possessed of many personal accomplishments and exemplary virtues, pious, moderate, sensible, and circumspect. She had exercised her authority with equal sagacity and resolution, respected even by those who were no friends to the house of Orange▪ and died with great fortitude and resignation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Feeling her end ap∣proaching, she delivered a key to one of her attendants, directing him to fetch two papers, which she signed with her own hand. One was a contract of marriage between her daughter and the prince of Nassau Weilburg; the o∣ther was a letter to the States General, beseeching them to consent to this marriage, and preserve inviolate the regula∣tions she had made, touching the education and tutelage of the young stadtholder. These two papers being signed and sealed, she sent for her chil∣dren, exhorted them to make proper improvements on the education they had received▪ and to live in harmony with each other. Then she im∣plored heaven to shower its blessings on them both, and embraced them with the most affecting marks of maternal tenderness. She afterwards continued to converse calmly and deliberately with her friends, and in a few hours expired.</NOTE>. In
<PB N="76" REF="750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> her will she appointed the king her father, and the princess dowager of Orange, her mother-in-law, honorary tutors, and prince Louis of Brunswic, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing tutor to her children. In the morning af∣ter her decease, the States General and the states of Holland were extraordinarily assembled, and having received notice of this event, proceeded to confirm the regulations which had been made for the minority of the stadtholder. Prince Louis of Brunswic was invited to assist in the assembly of Holland▪ where he took the oaths as representing the captain-general of the union. Then he com∣municated to the assembly, the act by which the princess had appointed him guardian of her chil∣dren. He was afterwards invited to the assembly of the States General, who agreed to the resolu∣tion of Holland with respect to his guardianship; and in the evening, the different colleges of the go∣vernment sent formal deputations to the young stadtholder, and the princess Caroline his sister, in whose names and presence they were received, and answered by their guardian and representative. A formal intimation of the death of the princess was communicated to the king her father, in a pathetic letter, by the States General, who condoled with him on the irreparable loss, which he as well as they had sustained by this melancholy event; and assured him they would employ all their care and attention in securing and defending the rights and interests of the young stadtholder, and the princess his sister, whom they considered as the children of the republic. The royal family of Eng∣land suffered another disaster in the course of this year, by the decease of the princess Elizabeth

Caroline, second daughter of his late royal highness<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Frederic prince of Wales, a lady of the most amia∣able character, who died at Kew in the month of September, before she had attained the eighteenth year of her age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Examples made of pyrates.</NOTE> Certain privateers continuing their excesses at sea, and rifling neutral ships without distinction or authority, the government resolved to vindicate the honour of the nation, by making examples of these pyrates, who, as fast as they could be detected and secured, were brought to trial, and upon con∣viction sacrificed to justice. While these steps were taken to rescue the nation from the reproach of violence and rapacity, which her neighbours had urged with such eagerness, equal spirit was ex∣erted in convincing neutral powers that they should not, with impunity, contravene the law of nations, in favouring the enemies of Great Britain. A great number of causes was tried, relating to dis∣puted captures, and many Dutch vessels, with their cargoes, were condemned after a fair hearing, not∣withstanding the loud clamours of that people, and the repeated remonstrances of the States General.</P>
<P>The reputation of the English was not so much affected by the irregularities of her privateers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Detail of some atro∣ciousmur∣ders.</NOTE> armed for rapine, as by the neglect of internal po∣lice, and an ingredient of savage ferocity, mingled in the national character; an ingredient that ap∣peared but too conspicuous in the particulars of several shocking murders brought to light about this period. One Halsey, who commanded a mer∣chant ship in the voyage from Jamaica to England, having conceived some personal dislike to a poor sailor, insulted him with such abuse, exposed him
<PB N="78" REF="770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to such hardships, and punished him with such wan∣tonness of barbarity, that the poor wretch leaped overboard in despair. His inhuman tyrant envying him that death▪ which would have rescued a mi∣serable object from his brutality, plunged into the sea after him, and brought him on board, declaring he should not so escape while there were any tor∣ments left to inflict. Accordingly he exercised his tyranny upon him with redoubled rigour, until the poor creature expired, in consequence of the inhu∣man treatment he had sustained. This savage ruf∣fian was likewise indicted for the murder of an∣other mariner, but being convicted on the first trial, the second was found unnecessary, and the criminal suffered death according to the law, which is per∣haps too mild to malefactors convicted of such ag∣gravated cruelty. Another barbarous murder was perpetrated in the country near Birmingham, upon a sheriff's officer, by the sons of one Darby, whose effects the bailiff had seized on a distress for rent. The two young assassins, encouraged by the father, attacked the unhappy wretch with clubs, and mangled him in a terrible manner, so that he hardly retained any signs of life. Not contented with this cruel execution, they stripped him naked, and dragging him out of the house, scourged him with a waggoner's whip, until the flesh was cut from his bones. In this miserable condition he was found weltring in his blood, and conveyed to a neighbouring house, where he immediately ex∣pired. The three barbarians were apprehended, after having made a desperate resistance. They were tried, convicted, and executed: the sons were hung in chains, and the body of the father diffect∣ed.

The widow of a timber-merchant at Rother∣hithe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> being cruelly murdered in her own house, Mary Edmonson, a young woman her niece, ran out into the street with her own arms cut across, and gave the alarm, declaring her aunt had been assassinated by four men, who forced their way into the house, and that she (the niece) had received those wounds in attempting to defend her relation. According to the circumstances that ap∣peared, this unnatural wretch had cut the throat of her aunt and benefactress with a case-knife, then dragged the body from the wash-house to the par∣lour; that she had stole a watch and some silver spoons, and concealed them, together with the knife and her own apron, which was soaked with the blood of her parent. After having acted this horrid tragedy, the bare recital of which the hu∣mane reader will not peruse without horror, she put on another apron, and wounded her own flesh, the better to conceal her guilt. Notwithstanding these precautions she was suspected, and commit∣ted to prison. Being brought to trial, she was con∣victed and condemned upon circumstantial evi∣dence, and finally, executed at Kennington-Com∣mon, though she denied the fact to the last moment of her life. At the place of execution she be∣haved with great composure, and, after having spent some minutes in devotion, protested she was innocent of the crime laid to her charge. What seemed to corroborate this protestation, was the condition and character of the young woman, who had been educated in a sphere above the vulgar, and maintained a reputation without reproach in the country, where she was actually betrothed to a
<PB N="80" REF="790"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> clergyman. On the other hand, the circumstances that appeared against her, almost amounted to a certainty, though nothing weaker than proof positive ought to determine a jury in capital cases, to give a verdict against the person accused. After all, this is one of those problematic events, which elude the force of all evidence, and serve to con∣found the pride of human reason. A miscreant, whose name was Haines, having espoused the daughter of a farmer in the neighbourhood of Gloucester, who possessed a small estate, which he intended to divide among seven children, was so abandoned as to form the design of poisoning the whole family, that by virtue of his wise he might enjoy the whole inheritance. For the execution of this infernal scheme, he employed his own father to purchase a quantity of arsenic; part of which he administered to three of the children, who were immediately seized with the dreadful symptoms produced by this mineral, and the eldest expired. He afterwards mixed it with three apple-cakes, which he bought for the purpose, and presented to the other three children, who underwent the same violence of operation which had proved fatal to the eldest brother. The instantaneous effects of the poison, created a suspicion of Haines, who be∣ing examined, the whole scene of villainy stood dis∣closed▪ Nevertheless, the villain found means to escape.</P>

one Jean de Manaux, their countryman and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> fellow▪prisoner, in revenge for his having disco∣vered that they had forged passes to facilitate their escape. Exasperated at this detection, they seized this unfortunate informer in the place of their con∣finement, gagged his mouth, stripped him naked, tied him with a strong cord to a ring-bolt, and scourged his body with the most brutal perseve∣rance. By dint of struggling the poor wretch dis∣engaged himself from the cord with which he had been tied: then they finished the tragedy, by leap∣ing and stamping on his breast, till the chest was broke, and he expired. They afterwards severed the body into small pieces, and these they conveyed at different times into the sea, through the funnel of a convenience to which they had access; but one of the other prisoners gave information of the murder, in consequence of which they were se∣cured, brought to trial, condemned and punished with death. Nor were the instances of cruel assas∣sination, which prevailed at this juncture, confined to Great Britain. At the latter end of the fore∣going year, an atrocious massacre was perpetrated by two Genoese mariners, upon the master and crew of an English vessel, among whom they were enrolled. These monsters of cruelty were in dif∣ferent watches, a circumstance that favoured the execution of the horrid plan they had concerted. When one of them retired to rest with his fellows of the watch, consisting of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and two sea∣men, he waited till they were fast asleep, and then butchered them all with a knife. Having so far succeeded without discovery, he returned to the deck, and communicated the exploit to his asso∣ciate:
<PB N="82" REF="810"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> then they suddenly attacked the master of the vessel, and cleft his head with an hatchet, which they likewise used in murdering the man that stood at the helm; a third was likewise dispatched, and no Englishman remained alive but the master's son, a boy▪ who lamented his father's death with inces∣sant tears and cries for three days, at the expiration of which he was likewise sacrificed, because the assassins were disturbed by his clamour. This bar∣barous scene was acted within sixty leagues of the rock of Lisbon; but the vessel was taken between the capes Ortugal and Finisterre, by the captain of a French privateer called La Favourite, who see∣ing the deck stained with blood, and finding all the papers of the ship destroyed, began to suspect that the master and crew had been murdered. He ac∣cordingly taxed them with the murder, and they confessed the particulars. The privateer touched at Vigo, where the captain imparted this detail to the English consul; but the prize, with the two villains on board, was sent to Bayonne in France, where it is to be hoped, for the honour of huma∣nity, they were brought to condign punishment, notwithstanding the war that subsists between the two nations; for there are certain established rights of general justice and humanity, which no parti∣cular war can destroy. We shall close this register of blood with the account of a murder, remarkable in all its circumstances, for which a person called Eugene Aram, suffered at York in the course of this year. This man, who exercised the profes∣sion of a schoolmaster at Knaresborough, had, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> far back as the year one thousand seven hundred and forty five, been concerned with one House
<PB N="83" REF="820"/>
man, in robbing and murdering Daniel Clarke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> whom they had previously persuaded to borrow a considerable quantity of valuable effects from dif∣ferent persons in the neighbourhood, on false pre∣tences, that he might retire with the booty. He had accordingly filled a sack with these particulars, and begun his retreat with his two perfidious asso∣ciates, who suddenly fell upon him, deprived him of life, and, having buried the body in a cave, took possession of the plunder. Though Clarke disappeared at once in such a mysterious manner, no suspicion fell upon the assassins; and Aram, who was the chief contriver and agent in the murder, moved his habitation to another part of the coun∣try. In the summer of the present year, House∣man being employed, among other labourers, in repairing the public highway, they, in digging for gravel by the road side, discovered the skeleton of a human creature, which the majority supposed to be the bones of Daniel Clarke. This opinion was no sooner broached than Houseman, as it were by some supernatural impulse which he could not resist, declared that it was not the skeleton of Clarke, in∣asmuch as his body had been interred in a place called St. Robert's Cave, where they would find it with the head turned to a certain corner. He was immediately apprehended, examined, admitted as evidence for the crown, and discovered the par∣ticulars of the murder. The skeleton of Clarke being found exactly in the place and manner he had described, Eugene Aram, who now acted as usher to a grammar-school in the county of Nor∣folk, was secured, and brought to trial at the York assizes. There, his own wife corroborating the tes∣timony
<PB N="84" REF="830"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of Houseman, he was found guilty, and received sentence of death, notwithstanding a very artful and learned defence, in which he proved, from argument and example, the danger of con∣victing a man upon circumstantial evidence. Find∣ing all his remonstrances ineffectual, he recom∣mended himself in pathetic terms to the king's mercy; and if ever murder was intitled to indul∣gence, perhaps it might have been extended, not improperly, to this man, whose genius, in itself prodigious, might have exerted itself in works of general utility. He had, in spite of all the disad∣vantages attending low birth, and straitened cir∣cumstances, by the dint of his own capacity and inclination, made considerable progress in mathe∣matics and philosophy, acquired all the languages ancient and modern, and executed part of a Celtic dictionary, which, had he lived to finish it, might have thrown some essential light upon the ori∣gin and obscurities of the European History. Convinced, at last, that he had nothing to hope from the clemency of the government, he wrote a short poem in defence of suicide; and, on the day fixed for his execution, opened the veins of his left arm with a razor, which he had concealed for that purpose. Though he was much weakened by the effusion of blood, before this attempt was disco∣vered; yet, as the instrument had missed the artery, he did not expire until he was carried to the gibbet, and underwent the sentence of the law. His body was conveyed to Knaresborough-forest, and hung in chains, near the place where the murder was perpetrated. These are some of the most remark∣able that appeared among many other instances of
<PB N="85" REF="840"/>
homicide; a crime that prevails to a degree alike<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> deplorable and surprising, even in a nation renown∣ed for compassion and placability. But this will generally be the case among people whose passions, naturally impetuous, are ill restrained by laws and the regulations of civil society, which the licentious do not fear, and the wicked hope to evade.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Majority of the prince of Wales.</NOTE> The prince of Wales having, in the beginning of June, entered the two and twentieth year of his age, the anniversary of his birth was celebrated with great rejoicings at court, and the king re∣ceived compliments of congratulation on the majo∣rity of a prince, who seemed born to fulfil the hopes and compleat the happiness of Great Britain. The city of London presented an address to the king on this occasion, replete with expressions of loyalty and affection, assuring his majesty, that no hostile threats could intimidate a people animated by the love of liberty▪ who, confiding in the Divine Providence, and in his majesty's experienced wis∣dom and vigorous councils, were resolved to exert their utmost efforts towards enabling their sove∣reign to repel the insults and defeat the attempts made by the antient enemies of his crown and kingdom.</P>
<P>Congratulations of the same kind were offered by other cities, towns, corporations, and commu∣nities, who vied with each other in professions of attachment; and, indeed, there was not the least trace of disaffection perceivable at this juncture in any part of the island.</P>
<P>So little were the citizens of London distressed by the expence, or incommoded by the operations of the war, that they found leisure to plan and

They had obtained an act of par∣liament, impowering them to build a new bridge over the Thames, from Black-friars to the opposite shore, about midway between those of London and Westminster. Commissioners were appointed to put this act in execution; and, at a court of com∣mon council, it was resolved, that a sum not ex∣ceeding one hundred and forty-four thousand pounds should be forthwith raised, within the space of eight years, by instalments, not exceeding thirty thousand pounds in one year, to be payed into the chamber of London; that the persons advancing the money should have an interest at the rate of four pounds per centum per annum, to be paid half yearly by the chamberlain, yet redeemable at the expiration of the first ten years; and that the chamberlain should affix the city's seal to such in∣struments as the committee might think fit to give, for securing the payment of the said annuities. Such were the first effectual steps taken towards the execution of a laudable measure, which met with the most obstinate opposition in the sequel, from the narrow views of particulars, as well as from the prejudice of party.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Confla∣gration in London.</NOTE> The spirit that now animated the citizens of London was such as small difficulties did not re∣tard, and even considerable losses could not dis∣courage. In the month of November the city was exposed to a dangerous conflagration, kindled in the night by accident in the neighbourhood of the Royal Exchange, which burned with great fury, notwithstanding the assistance of the firemen and
<PB N="87" REF="860"/>
engines, employed under the personal direction of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the magistracy, consumed a good number of houses, and damaged many more. The whole quarter of the town was filled with consternation: some indi∣viduals were beggared; one or two perished in the flames, and some were buried in the ruin of the houses that sunk under the disaster. The inhabi∣tants of London must be always subject to such calamities, until the houses are rebuilt in a more substantial stile of architecture. Composed as they are at present of the worst materials, huddled to∣gether in the slightest manner, without beauty, or∣der, strength, or uniformity, they totter as they stand, weakly supported by one another, without solidity to stand independent of that support, with∣out walls of division to stop the progress of the flames in any accidental conflagration. Such are the dangers attending the practice of letting build∣ing leases to ignorant and mercenary tradesmen, who, without skill, or concern for the consequence, rear up those frail tenements for sale, and, to a sordid thirst of lucre, shamefully sacrifice the lives of their fellow-creatures. In other countries this is deemed a consideration of great importance, and in time, it is to be hoped, may engage the no∣tice of the British legislature, among other evils arising from the spirit of jobbing, which seems to have diffused itself through every department of public and private oeconomy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Method contrived to find out the longitude at sea.</NOTE> The ferment of mind so peculiar to the natives of Great Britain, excited by a strange mixture of genius and caprice, passion and philosophy, study and conjecture, produced at this period some flowers of improvement, in different arts and

Several persons invented methods for dis∣covering the longitude at sea, that great desidera∣tum in navigation, for the ascertainment of which so many nations have offered a public recompence, and in the investigation of which so many mathe∣matical heads have been disordered. Some of those, who now appeared candidates for the prize, deserved encouragement for the ingenuity of their several systems; but he who seemed to enjoy the pre-eminence, in the opinion and favour of the public, was Mr. Irwin, a native of Ireland, who contrived a chair so artfully poised, that a person, sitting in it, on board a ship, even in a rough sea, can, through a telescope, observe the immersion and emersion of Jupiter's satellites, without being interrupted or incommoded by the motion of the vessel. This gentleman was favoured with the as∣sistance and protection of commodore lord Howe, in whose presence the experiment was tried in se∣veral ships at sea with such success, that he granted a certificate, signifying his approbation; and, in consequence of this, Mr. Irwin is said to have ob∣tained a considerable reward from the board of ad∣miralty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill of general Hawley.</NOTE> Among other occurences of this year, that serve to denote the peculiarity of temper that sometimes appears among the English people, we shall insert the last will of lieutenant-general Hawley <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Copy of the will of the late lieutenant-general <HI>Hawley.</HI></P>
<P>I being perfectly well, both in body and mind, now that I am writing this my last will, by which I do hereby give, order, and dispose of what is mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, both real and personal, that there may be no disputes after I am gone—Therefore, as I began the world with no∣thing, and as all I have is of my own acquiring, I dispose of it as I please. But, first, I direct and order, that as there is now a peace, and I may die the common way, my carcase may be put any where; it is equal to me: but I will have no more expence, or ridicu∣lous show, than if a poor sol∣dier (who is as good a man) was to be buried from the hos∣pital. The priest, I conclude, will have his fee; let the puppy have it; pay the carpenter for the carcase box. Debts I have none at this time: some very small trifles of course there may be; let them be paid; there is wherewith to do it. First, then, to my only sister Anne Hawley, if she survives me, I give and bequeath five thou∣sand pounds sterling out of the seven thousand five hun∣dred which I have at this time in bank-annuities of one thousand seven hundred and forty-eight. Be that al∣tered or not, I still give her five thousand pounds out of what I die worth, to dis∣pose of as she pleases, and this to be made over to her, or paid, as soon as possible after I am dead; a month at most. As to any other rela∣tions, I have none who want; and I as was never married, I have no heirs; I therefore have long since taken it in my head to adopt one heir and son, after the manner of the Romans, who I hereafter name. But first, there is one Mrs. Elizabeth Toovey, widow, mother of this afore∣said adopted son, who has been for many years my friend and companion, and often my careful nurse, and in my absence a faithful steward: she is the person I think my∣self bound in honour and gra∣titude to provide for as well as I can, during her life. I do therefore give and be∣queath unto the said Eliza∣beth Toovey, widow, all that my freehold estate, houses, outhouses, &amp;c. and all the land thereto belonging, situ∣ated at the upper end of West-Green, in the parish of Hartley-Wintney, and county of Southampton, which I bought of William Shipway: I likewise give the said Eliza∣beth Toovey the lands or farm, commonly called Ex∣all's farm, which join to the aforesaid lands bought of William Shipway, and which I bought of lord Castlemain. I also give her the field adjoining thereto, which I bought of farmer Hellhouse, called the paddock. I like∣wise give to the said Elizabeth Toovey my farm-house, other house, and all outhouses, &amp;c. and all the lands thereto be∣longing, situate at the bot∣tom of West-Green parish, and county aforesaid, which farm, lands, &amp;c. I bought of farmer Hellhouse. I likewise give and bequeath unto the said Elizabeth Toovey, the great meadow which I bought of Thomas Ellis, carpenter, or wright, which is commonly called Tilligany; and I give also the little meadow over-against the great one, part of the purchase made of far∣mer Hellhouse, to her. And I also give to the said Eliza∣beth Toovey a little barn and farm I lately purchased, called Birchen Reeds, upon Hazely Heath, in the parish of Mat∣tingly, or Heezfield. I like∣wise give and bequeath to the said Elizabeth Toovey my house, stables, outhouses, and all the ground thereto be∣longing, which I purchased lately of the widow Rooke, situate in the parish of St. George, near Hyde-park gate, in the county of Middlesex, she to hold and possess these several houses and estates during her natural life; and then, after her disease, I give and bequeath them unto her second son, Captain William Toovey, my adopted son and heir, at present a captain in the regiment of royal dra∣goons under my command; then when his mother dies, and not before, the whole which I have and do give her, to come to him, and be his and his heirs for ever. And do direct and require the said captain William Too∣vey, that as soon as I am dead he shall forthwith take upon him both my names, and sign them, either by act of parliament, or otherwise, as shall be needful. I do order and appoint that the aforesaid Elizabeth Toovey shall have the use of all my goods, plate, &amp;c. during her life, as also the use and in∣terest of all the sums of mo∣ney I die possessed of in pre∣sent, as also what shall be due to me from the govern∣ment during her natural life, except always the five thou∣sand pounds which I give my sister, and what legacies here∣after follow, and debts paid, my horses and arms exclusive. I do appoint captain William Toovey my sole executor and trustee, to see this my will executed punctually, and to act in behalf of my sister, his
mother, brother, and him∣self, and to state my accounts with my agent for the time being, and all others con∣cerned. As to his brother lieutenant-colonel John Too∣vey, I give and bequeath unto him one thousand pounds out of the money the govern∣ment owes me, when paid. I also give him all my horses and arms. I also give him up the writings and money which his brother captain William Toovey owes me, lent him for the several pre∣ferments in the regiment. I give and bequeath to Eliza∣beth Burkitt, spinster, one hundred pounds as a legacy, she having been an useful a∣greeable handmaid to me; but upon this condition that she never marries lieutenant-colonel J. T. if she does, I give her nothing. Likewise, if lieutenant-colonel J. T. should be fool enough ever to marry her Elizabeth Burkitt, I disannul whatever relates to her and him; and I give no∣thing either to lieutenant-co∣lonel T. or to her. And if after all this, they should be both fools, and marry, I do hereby give, what I had given to them, I say, I give it to my sister Anne Hawley, and her heirs, and order her or them to sue for the same. I once more appoint captain William Toovey, my execu∣tor and trustee, and I order him to administer: there is no debts will trouble him or his mother: what there is she shall pay; and that he im∣mediately wait on my sister with a copy of this will▪ if she survives me; if not, what I give her is his. In case I have not time to make an∣other will, my house in the Mews, which lease is almost out, my sister has already by my gift. My house at Charl∣ton I shall sell, so do not mention it. I have no other will but this, which is my last. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, having writ it all with my own hand, and signed each page; and this I did because I hate all priests of all professions, and have the worst opinion of all mem∣bers of the law.

This horrid banquet having, as it were, fleshed the famished crew, they began to talk of another sacrifice, from which, however, they were diverted by the influence and remon∣strances of their captain, who prevailed upon them to be satisfied with a miserable allowance to each per diem, cut from a pair of leathern breeches found in the cabbin. Upon this calamitous pit∣tance, reinforced with the grass which grew plen∣tifully upon the deck, these poor objects made shift to subsist for twenty days, at the expiration of which they were relieved, and taken on board one captain Bradshaw, who chanced to fall in with them at sea. By this time the whole crew, con∣sisting of seven men, were so squalid and ema∣ciated, as to exhibit an appearance at once piteous and terrible; and so reduced in point of strength, that it was found necessary to use ropes and tackle for hoisting them from one ship to the other. The circumstance of the lot falling upon the Spaniard, who was the only foreigner on board, encourages a suspicion that foul play was offered to this unfortu∣nate stranger; but the most remarkable part of this whole incident is, that the master and crew could not contrive some sort of tackle to catch fish, with which the sea every where abounds, and which, no doubt, might be caught with the help of a little ingenuity. If implements of this kind were provided in every ship, they would probably prevent all those tragical events at sea that are oc∣casioned by famine.</P>

In the month of February a French privateer, be∣longing to Granville, called the Marquis de Ma∣rigny, having on board near two hundred men, and mounted with twenty cannon, was taken by captain Parker, commander of his majesty's ship the Montague; who likewise made prize of a smaller armed vessel, from Dunkirk, of eight can∣non and sixty men.</P>

Captain Hood, having made a signal to the ad∣miral, continued the chace until he advanced with∣in half musket-shot of the enemy, and then poured in a broadside, which was immediately retorted. The engagement, thus begun, was maintained with great vigour on both sides for the space of four hours; at the expiration of which the Bel∣lona struck, after having lost all her masts and rigging, together with about forty men killed in the action: nor was the victor in a much better condition. Thirty men were killed and wounded on board of the Vestal. Immediately after the enemy submitted, all her rigging being destroyed by the shot, the topmast fell overboard; and she was otherwise so damaged, that she could not pro∣ceed on her voyage. Captain Hood, therefore, re∣turned with his prize to Spithead; and afterwards met with a gracious reception from his majesty, on account of the valour and conduct he had displayed on this occasion. The Bellona had sailed in Janua∣ry from the island of Martinique, along with the Florissant, and another French frigate, from which she had been separated in the passage.</P>

As they fought in the dark, captain Gilchrist was obliged to lie by for some time, be∣cause he could not distinguish the one from the other; but no sooner did the day appear than he bore down upon the Danae with his usual impe∣tuosity, and soon compelled her to surrender: she did not strike, however, until thirty or forty of her men were slain; and the gallant captain Gilchrist had received a grape-shot in his shoulder, which though it did not deprive him of life, yet rendered him incapable of future service: a misfortune the more to be lamented, as it happened to a brave of∣ficer in the vigour of his age, and in the midst of a sanguinary war, which might have afforded him many other opportunities of signalizing his cou∣rage, for the honour and advantage of his country.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Havre de Grace bombard∣ed by rear-ad∣miral Rodney.</NOTE> Having taken notice of all the remarkable cap∣tures and exploits that were made and atchieved by single ships, since the commencement of the pre∣sent year, we shall now proceed to describe the ac∣tions that were performed in this period by the dif∣ferent squadrons that constituted the naval power of Great Britain. Intelligence having been received that the enemy meditated an invasion upon some of the British territories, and that a number of flat∣bottomed boats were prepared at Havre de Grace, for the purpose of disembarking troops, rear ad∣miral Rodney was, in the beginning of July, de∣tached with a small squadron of ships and bombs to annoy and overawe that part of the coast of France. He accordingly anchored in the road of Havre, and made a disposition to execute the in∣structions he had received. The bomb vessels be∣ing placed in the narrow channel of the river lead∣ing to Honfleur, began to throw their shells, and continued the bombardment for two and fifty hours, without intermission, during which a numerous body of French troops was employed in throwing up entrenchments, erecting new batteries, and firing both with shot and shells upon the assailants. The town was set on fire in several places, and burned with great fury; some of the boats were overturned, and a few of them reduced to ashes, while the inhabitants forsook the place in the ut∣most consternation: nevertheless, the damage done to the enemy was too inconsiderable to make amends for the expence of the armament, and the
<PB N="105" REF="1050"/>
loss of nineteen hundred shells and eleven hundred<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> carcasses, which were expended on this expedition. Bombardments of this kind are at best but expen∣sive and unprofitable operations, and may be deem∣ed a barbarous method of prosecuting war, inas∣much as the damage falls upon the wretched inha∣bitants, who have given no cause of offence, and who are generally spared by a humane enemy, un∣less they have committed some particular act of provocation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The squa∣dron of M. De la Clue de∣feated by admiral Boscawen.</NOTE> The honour of the British flag was much more effectually asserted by the gallant admiral Bos∣cawen, who, as we have already observed, was en∣trusted with the conduct of a squadron in the Medi∣terranean. It must be owned, however, that his first attempt favoured of temerity. Having in vain dis∣played the British flag in sight of Toulon, by way of defiance to the French fleet that there lay at an∣chor, he ordered three ships of the line, commanded by the captains Smith, Harland, and Barker, to advance and burn two ships that lay close to the mouth of the harbour. They accordingly ap∣proached with great intrepidity, and met with a very warm reception from divers batteries which they had not before perceived. Two small forts they attempted to destroy, and cannonaded for some time with great fury; but being over∣matched by superior force, and the wind subsiding into a calm, they sustained considerable damage, and were towed off with great difficulty, in a very shattered condition. The admiral seeing three of his best ships so roughly handled in this enterprize, returned to Gibraltar in order to refit; and M. de
<PB N="106" REF="1060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> la Clue, the French commander of the squadron at Toulon, seized this opportunity of sailing, in hope of passing the Streights mouth unobserved, his fleet consisting of twelve large ships and three frigates. Admiral Boscawen, who commanded fourteen sail of the line, with two frigates, and as many fire∣ships, having refitted his squadron, detached one frigate to cruise off Malaga, and another to hover between Estepona and Ceuta-point; with a view to keep a good look out, and give timely no∣tice in case the enemy should approach. On the seventeeth day of August, at eight in the even∣ing, the Gibraltar frigate made a signal that four∣teen sail appeared on the Barbary snore to the east∣ward of Ceuta; upon which the English admiral immediately heaved up his anchors and went to sea: at day light he descried seven large ships lying to; but when the English squadron forbore to answer their signal, they discovered their mistake, set all their sails, and made the best of their way. This was the greater part of the French squadron com∣manded by Mr. de la Clue, from whom five of his large ships and three frigates had separated in the night. Even now perhaps he might have escaped, had he not been obliged to wait for the Souveraine, which was a heavy sailer. At noon the wind, which had blown a fresh gale, died away; and although admiral Boscawen had made signal to chace and en∣gage in a line of battle a-head, it was not till half an hour after two that some of his headmost ships could close with the rear of the enemy; which, though greatly outnumbered, fought with uncom∣mon bravery. The English admiral, without wait∣ing
<PB N="107" REF="1070"/>
to return the fire of the sternmost, which he re∣ceived<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> as he passed, used all his endeavours to come up with the Ocean, which Mr. de la Clue com∣manded in person; and about four o'clock in the afternoon running athwart her hawse, poured into her a furious broadside: thus the engagement began with equal vigour on both sides. This dispute how∣ever was of short duration; in about half an hour admiral Boscawen's mizen-mast and topsail-yards were shot away; and the enemy hoisted all the sail they could carry. Mr. Boscawen having shifted his flag from the Namur to the Newark, joined some other ships in attacking the Centaur of seventy-four cannon, which, being thus overpowered, was ob∣liged to surrender. The British admiral pursued them all night, during which the Souveraine and the Guerrier altered their course, and deserted their commander. At day-break, Mr. de la Clue, whose left leg had been broke in the engagement, perceiv∣ing the English squadron crowding all their sails to come up with him, and finding himself on the coast of Portugal, determined to burn his ships rather than they should fall into the hands of the victors. The Ocean was run ashore two leagues from Lagos, near the fort of Almadana, the com∣mander of which fired three shots at the English: another captain of the French squadron followed the example of his commander; and both endea∣voured to disembark their men: but the sea being rough, this proved a very tedious and difficult at∣tempt. The captains of the Temeraire and Mo∣deste, instead of destroying their ships, anchored as near as they could to the forts Exavier and Lagres,
<PB N="108" REF="1080"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> in hope of enjoying their protection; but in this hope they were disappointed. Mr. de la Clue had been landed, and the command of the Ocean was left to the Count de Carne, who having received one broadside from the America, struck his colours, and the English took possession of this noble prize, the best ship in the French navy, mounted with eighty cannon. Captain Bentley of the Warspight, who had remarkably signalized himself by his cou∣rage during the action of the preceding day, at∣tacked the Temeraire of seventy four guns, and brought her off with little damage. Vice-admiral Broderick, the second in command, advancing with his division, burned the Redoubtable of seventy∣four guns, which was bulged, and abandoned by her men and officers; but they made prize of the Modeste, carrying sixty-four guns, which had not been much injured in the engagement. This vic∣tory was obtained by the English admiral at a very small expence of men; the whole number of the killed and wounded not exceeding two hundred and fifty on board of the British squadron; though the carnage among the enemy must have been much more considerable, as Mr. de la Clue, in his letter to the French ambassador at Lisbon, owns, that on board of his own ship the Ocean, one hundred men were killed on the spot, and seventy dangerously wounded: but the most severe circumstance of this disaster was the loss of four capital ships, two of which were destroyed, and the other two brought in triumph to England, to be numbered among the best bottoms of the British navy. What augmented the good fortune of the victors, was, that not one

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions made by France for an invasion of Great Britain.</NOTE> As we propose to throw together all the naval transactions of the year, especially those that hap∣pened in the European seas, that they may be comprehended as it were in one view; we must now, without regarding the order of time, postpone many previous events of importance, and record the last action by sea, that in the course of this year dis∣tinguished the flag of Great Britain. The court of Versailles, in order to embarrass the British ministry, and divert their attention from all external expedi∣tions, had in the winter projected a plan for invad∣ing some part of the British dominions; and in the beginning of the year had actually begun to make preparations on different parts of their coast, for carrying this design into execution. Even as far back as the latter end of May, messages from the king to both houses of parliament, were delivered by the earl of Holderness and Mr. Pitt, the two se∣cretaries of state, importing that his majesty had re∣ceived advices of preparations making by the French court, with a design to invade Great Bri∣tain: that though persuaded by the universal zeal and affection of his people, any such attempt, must, under the blessing of God, end in the destruction of those who engaged in it; yet he apprehended he should not act consistent with that paternal care and concern which he had always shewn for the safety and preservation of his subjects, if he omitted any means in his power, which might be necessary for
<PB N="110" REF="1100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> their defence: he therefore acquainted the parlia∣ment with his having received repeated intelligence of the enemy's preparations, to the end that his majesty might, if he should think proper, in pur∣suance of the late act of parliament, cause the mi∣litia, or such part thereof as should be necessary, to be drawn out and embodied, in order to march as occasion should require.</P>
<P>These messages were no sooner read, than each house separately resolved to present an address, thank∣ing his majesty for having communicated this in∣telligence; assuring him that they would with their lives and fortunes support him against all attempts whatever: that warmed with affection and zeal for his person and government, and animated by indig∣nation at the daring designs of an enemy whose fleet had hitherto shunned the terror of the British navy, they would chearfully exert their utmost ef∣forts to repel all insults, and effectually enable their sovereign, not only to disappoint the attempts of France, but, by the blessing of God, turn them to their own confusion. The commons at the same time resolved upon another address, desiring his majesty would give directions to his lieutenants of the several counties, ridings, and places within South Britain, to use their utmost diligence and at∣tention in executing the several acts of parliament made for the better ordering the militia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of Thu∣rot.</NOTE> These and other precautionary steps were accord∣ingly taken; but the administration wisely placed their chief dependence upon the strength of the navy, part of which was so divided and stationed, as to block up all the harbours of France, in which the enemy were known to make any naval arma∣ment

of consequence. We have seen in what man∣ner<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> rear-admiral Rodney visited the town and har∣bour of Havre de Grace, and scoured that part of the coast in successive cruises: we have also re∣corded the expedition and victory of admiral Bos∣cawen, over the squadron of La Clue, which was equipped at Toulon, with design to assist in the projected invasion. Notwithstanding this disaster, the French ministry persisted in their design; to∣wards the execution of which, they had prepared another considerable fleet, at the harbours of Roch∣fort, Brest, and Port-Louis, to be commanded by Mr de Conflans, and reinforced by a considerable body of troops, which were actually assembled un∣der the D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c d'Aiguillon, at Vannes in Lower Bre∣tagne. Flat-bottomed boats, and transports to be used in this expedition, were prepared in different ports on the coast of France; and a small squadron was equipped at Dunkirk, under the command of an enterprising adventurer called Thurot, who had in the course of the preceding year signalized his courage and conduct in a large privateer called the Belleisle, who had scoured the North Seas, taken a number of ships, and at one time maintained an obstinate battle against two English frigates, which were obliged to desist, after having received confi∣derable damage.</P>
<P>This man's name became a terror to the mer∣chants of Great Britain; for his valour was not more remarkable in battle than his conduct in eluding the pursuit of the British cruisers, who were suc∣cessively detached in quest of him, through every part of the German Ocean and North Sea, as far as the island of Orkneys. It must likewise be owned

The court of Versailles were not insen∣sible to his merit. He obtained a commission from the French king, and was vested with the com∣mand of the small armament now fitting out in the harbour of Dunkirk.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Squa∣drons sta∣tioned on the coast of France.</NOTE> The British government, being apprised of all these particulars, took such measures to defeat the proposed invasion, as must have conveyed a very high idea of the power of Great Britain to those who considered, that, exclusive of the force op∣posed to this design, they at the same time carried on the most vigorous and important operations of war in Germany, America, the East and West Indies. Thurot's armament at Dunkirk was watched by an English squadron in the Downs, commanded by commodore Boys; the port of Havre was guarded by rear-admiral Rodney; Mr. Boscawen had been stationed off Toulon; and the coast of Vannes was scoured by a small squadron detached from Sir Edward Hawke, who had during the whole summer blocked up the harbour of Brest, where Conflans lay with his fleet, in order to be joined by the other divisions of the armament. These different squadrons of the British navy were connected by a chain of separate cruisers; so that the whole coast of France, from Dunkirk to the ex∣tremity

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions on the coast of France.</NOTE> The French ministry being thus hampered, for∣bore their attempt upon Britain; and the projected invasion seemed to hang in suspence, till the month of August, in the beginning of which their army in Germany was defeated at Minden. Their de∣signs in that country being baffled by this disaster, they seemed to convert their chief attention to their sea-armament; the preparations were resumed with redoubled vigour; and even after the defeat of La Clue, they resolved to try their fortune in a de∣scent. They now proposed to disembark a body of troops in Ireland. Thurot received orders to sail from Dunkirk with the first opportunity, and shape his course round the northern parts of Scot∣land, that he might alarm the coast of Ireland, and make a diversion from that part where Conflans in∣tended to effectuate the disembarkation of his forces. The transports and ships of war were as∣sembled at Brest and Rochfort, having on board a train of artillery, with saddles, and other accou∣trements for cavalry, to be mounted in Ireland. A body of French troops, including part of the Irish Brigade, was kept in readiness to embark; and the young pretender, having agreed to the terms proposed by France, remained in the neigh∣bourhood of Vannes incognito, in order once more to hazard his person, and countenance a revolt in the dominions of Great Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French fleet sails from B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est.</NOTE> The execution of this scheme was, however, prevented by the vigilance of Sir Edward Hawke, who blocked up the harbour of Brest, with a fleet of twenty-three capital ships; while another squa∣dron

At length how∣ever, in the beginning of November, the British squadron commanded by Sir Edward Hawke, Sir Charles Hardy, and rear-admiral Geary, were driven from the coast of France by stress of weather, and on the ninth day of the month anchored in Torbay. The French admiral Conflans snatched this oppor∣tunity of sailing from Brest, with one and twenty-sail of the line and four frigates, in hope of being able to destroy the English squadron commanded by captain Duff, before the larger fleet could return from the coast of England. Sir Edward Hawke hav∣ing received intelligence that the French fleet had sailed from Brest, immediately stood to sea, in order to pursue them; and in the mean time, the go∣vernment issued orders for guarding all those parts of the coast that were thought the most exposed to a descent. The land-forces were put in motion, and quartered along the shore in Kent and Sussex: all the ships of war in the different harbours, even those that had just arrived from America, were or∣dered to put to sea, and every step was taken to disconcert the designs of the enemy.</P>

Sir Edward Hawke, who, when the Maidstone gave the first notice, had formed the line a-breast, now perceiv∣ing that the French admiral endeavoured to escape with all the sail he could carry, threw out a sig∣nal for seven of his ships that were nearest the enemy to chace, and endeavour to detain them, until they could be reinforced by the rest of the squadron, which were ordered to form into a line of battle a-head, as they chaced, that no time might be lost in the pursuit.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> frustrate at once a boasted scheme projected for the annoyance of his fellow subjects. With respect to his ships of the line, he had but the advantage of one in point of number, and no superiority in men or metal, consequently Mr. de Conflans might have hazarded a fair battle on the open sea, with∣out any imputation of temerity: but he thought proper to play a more artful game, though it did not succeed according to his expectation. He kept his fleet in a body, and retired close in shore, with a view to draw the English squadron among the shoals and islands, on which he hoped they would pay dear for their rashness and impetuosity, while he and his officers, who were perfectly ac∣quainted with the navigation, could either stay, and take advantage of the disaster, or, if hard pressed, retire through channels unknown to the British pilots.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Over whom he obtains a com∣plete vic∣tory.</NOTE> At half an hour after two, the van of the Eng∣lish fleet began the engagement with the rear of the enemy, in the neighbourhood of Belleisle. Every ship as she advanced poured in a broad-side on the sternmost of the French, and bore down upon their van, leaving the rear to those that came after. Sir Edward Hawke, in the Royal George of one hundred and ten guns, reserved his fire in passing through the rear of the enemy, and or∣dered his master to bring him along-side of the French admiral, who commanded in person on board of the Soleil Royal, a ship mounted with eighty cannon, and provided with a complement of twelve hundred men. When the pilot remon∣strated that he could not obey his command, with∣out the most imminent risque of running upon a
<PB N="117" REF="1170"/>
shoal, the brave veteran replied, "You have done<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> your duty in shewing the danger; now you are to comply with my order, and lay me along-side the Soleil Royal." His wish was gratified: the Royal George ranged up with the French admiral. The Thesée, another large ship of the enemy, run∣ning up between the two commanders, sustained the fire that was reserved for the Soleil Royal; but in returning the first broadside foundered in con∣sequence of the high sea that entered her lower deck-ports, and filled her with water. Notwith∣standing the boisterous weather, a good number of ships on both sides fought with equal fury and dubious success, till about four in the afternoon, when the Formidable struck her colours. The Superbe shared the fate of the Thesée in going to the bottom. The Heros hauled down her colours in token of submission, and dropped anchor; but the wind was so high, that no boat could be sent to take possession▪ By this time day-light began to fail, and the greater part of the French fleet escaped under cover of the darkness.</P>
<P>Night approaching, the wind blowing with aug∣mented violence on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lee-shore, and the British squadron being intan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led among unknown shoals and islands, Sir Edward Hawke made the signal for anchoring to the westward of the small island Dumet; and here the fleet remained all night in a very dangerous riding, alarmed by the fury of the storm, and the incessant firing of guns of distress, without their knowing whether it proceeded from friend or enemy. The S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eil Royal had, under favour of the night, anchored also in the midst of the British squadron: but at day-break Mr. de Con∣flans
<PB N="118" REF="1180"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> ordered her cable to be cut, and she drove ashore to the westward of Crozie. The English admiral immediately made signal to the Essex to slip capable, and pursue her; and, in obeying this order, she ran unfortunately on a sand▪bank, called Lefour, where the Resolution, another ship of the British squadron, was already grounded. Here they were both irrecoverably lost, in spite of all the assistance that could be given: but all their men, and part of their stores, were saved, and the wreck set on fire by order of the admiral. He likewise detached the Portland, Chatham, and Vengeance, to destroy the Soleil Royal, which was burned by her own people, before the English ships could ap∣proach; but they arrived time enough to reduce the Heros to ashes on the Lefour, where she had been also stranded; and the Juste, another of their great ships, perished in the mouth of the Loire.</P>
<P>The admiral, perceiving seven large ships of the enemy riding at anchor between Point Penvas and the mouth of the river Vilaine, made the signal to weigh, in order to attack them; but the fury of the storm increased to such a degree, that he was obliged to remain at anchor, and even order the top-gallant-masts to be struck.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the French ships being light∣ened of their cannon, their officers took advantage of the flood, and a more moderate gale under the land, to enter the Vilaine, where they lay within half a mile of the entrance, protected by some oc∣casional batteries erected on the shore, and by two large frigates, moored across the mouth of the harbour. Thus they were effectually secured from any attempts of small vessels; and as for large
<PB N="119" REF="1190"/>
ships, there was not water sufficient to float them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> within fighting distance of the enemy.</P>
<P>On the whole, this battle, in which a very in∣considerable number of lives was lost, may be con∣sidered as one of the most perilous and important actions that ever happened in any war between the two nations: for it not only defeated the projected invasion, which had hung menacing so long over the apprehensions of Great Britain; but it gave the finishing blow to the naval power of France, which was totally disabled from undertaking any thing of consequence in the sequel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During the present war, the English had already taken and destroyed twenty-seven French ships of the line, and thirty-one frigates: two of their great ships and four fri∣gates perished: so that their whole loss, in this particular, amounted to sixty-four; whereas the loss of Great Britain did not exceed seven sail of the line, and five fri∣gates. It may be easily con∣ceived how the French ma∣rine, at first greatly inferior to the naval power of Britain, must have been affected by this dreadful ballance to its prejudice.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>By this time, indeed, Thurot had escaped from Dunkirk, and directed his course to the North Sea, whither he was followed by commodore Boys, who nevertheless was disappointed in his pursuit; but the fate of that enterprising adventurer falls under the annals of the ensuing year, among the trans∣actions of which it shall be recorded.</P>
<P>As for Sir Edward Hawke, he continued cruising off the coast of Bretagne for a considerable time after the victory he had obtained, taking particu∣lar care to block up the mouth of the river Vilaine, that the seven French ships might not escape, and
<PB N="120" REF="1200"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> join Mr. Conflans, who made shift to reach Roch∣fort with the shattered remains of his squadron. Indeed, this service became such a considerable ob∣ject in the eyes of the British ministry, that a large fleet was maintained upon this coast, apparently for no other purpose, during a whole year; and, after all, the enemy eluded their vigilance.</P>
<P>Sir Edward Hawke▪ having undergone a long and dangerous conflict with tempestuous wea∣ther, was at length recalled, and presented to his sovereign, who gratified him with a considerable pension, for the courage and conduct he had so often and so long displayed in the service of his country; and his extraordinary merit was after∣wards honoured with the approbation of the par∣liament.</P>
<P>The people of France were so dispirited by the defeat of their army at Minden, and the disaster of their squadron at Lagos, that the ministry of Ver∣sailles thought proper to conceal the extent of their last misfortune under a palliating detail, published in the Gazette of Paris, as a letter from Mr. Con∣flans to the count de St. Florentin▪ secretary of the marine. In this partial misrepresentation their admiral was made to affirm, that the British fleet consisted of forty ships of the line of battle, besides frigates; that the Soleil Royal had obliged the Royal George to sheer off; that the seven ships, which retreated into the river Vilaine, had received very little damage, and would be soon repaired; and that, by the junction of Bompart's squadron, he should be soon able to give a good account of the English admiral. These tumid assertions, so void of truth, are not to be imputed to an illiberal

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings of the Irish parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The alarm of the French invasion, which was thus so happily frustrated, not only disturbed the quiet of Great Britain, but also diffused itself to the kingdom of Ireland, where it was productive of some public disorder. In the latter end of Oc∣tober the two houses of parliament, assembled at Dublin, received a formal message from the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of that kingdom, to the following effect: That, by a letter from the secretary of state, written by his majesty's express command, it appeared that France, far from re∣signing her plan of invasion, on account of the disaster that befel her Toulon squadron, was more and more confirmed in her purpose, and even insti∣gated by despair itself, to attempt, at all hazards, the only resource she seemed to have left, for thwart∣ing, by a diversion at home, the measures of Eng∣land abroad, in prosecuting a war which hitherto opened, in all parts of the world, so unfavourable a prospect to the views of French ambition: that in case the body of French troops, amounting to eighteen thousand men, under the command of the duc d'Aiguillon, assembled at Vannes, where also a sufficient number of transports was prepared, should be able to elude the British squadron, Ire∣land would, in all probability, be one of their chief objects; his grace thought it therefore incumbent upon him, in a matter of such high importance to the welfare of that kingdom, to communicate this intelligence to the Irish parliament. He told them, his majesty would make no doubt but that the zeal
<PB N="122" REF="1220"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of his faithful protestant subjects in that kingdom, had been already sufficiently quickened by the re∣peated accounts received of the enemy's dangerous designs, and actual preparations made, at a vast expence, in order to invade the several parts of the British dominions. He gave them to understand, he had received his sovereign's commands to use his utmost endeavours to animate and excite his loyal people of Ireland to exert their well-known zeal and spirit in support of his majesty's govern∣ment, and in defence of all that was dear to them, by timely preparation to resist and frustrate any attempts of the enemy to disturb the quiet, and snake the security of this kingdom: he therefore, in the strongest manner, recommended it to them to manifest, upon this occasion, that zeal for the present happy establishment, and that affection for his majesty's person and government, by which the parliament of that nation had been so often distinguished.</P>
<P>Immediately after this message was communi∣cated, the house of commons unanimously re∣solved to present an address to the lord lieutenant, thanking his grace for the care and concern he had shewn for the safety of Ireland, in having imparted intelligence of so great importance; desiring him to make use of such means as should appear to him the most effectual for the security and defence of the kingdom; and assuring him, that the house would make good whatever expence should be ne∣cessarily incurred for that purpose.</P>
<P>This intimation, and the steps that were taken, in consequence of it, for the defence of Ireland, produced such apprehensions and distraction among
<PB N="123" REF="1230"/>
the people of that kingdom, as had well nigh<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> proved fatal to the public credit. In the first trans∣ports of popular fear, there was such an extraordi∣nary run upon the banks of Dublin, that several considerable bankers were obliged to stop pay∣ment; and the circulation was in danger of being suddenly stagnated, when the lord lieutenant, the members of both houses of parliament, the lord mayor, aldermen, merchants, and principal traders of Dublin, engaged in an association to support public credit, by taking the notes of bankers in payment: a resolution which effectually answered the purpose intended.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Loyalty of the ca∣tholicks of Ire∣land.</NOTE> Howsoever the court of Versailles might have flattered itself, that their invading army would in Ireland be joined by a great number of the natives, in all probability it would have been disappointed in this hope, had their purposed descent even been carried into execution; for no signs of disaffection to the reigning family appeared at this juncture. On the contrary, the wealthy individuals of the Romish persuasion offered to accommodate the go∣vernment with large sums of money, in case of ne∣cessity, to support the present establishment against all its enemies; and the Roman catholicks of the city of Corke, in a body, presented an address to the lord lieutenant, expressing their loyalty in the warmest terms of assurance. After having con∣gratulated his grace on the unparalleled successes which had attended his majesty's arms, and ex∣pressed their sense of the king's paternal tenderness for his kingdom of Ireland, they acknowledged, with the deepest sense of gratitude, that protection and indulgence they had enjoyed under his ma∣jesty's

They professed the warmest indignation at the threatened invasion of the kingdom by an enemy, who, grown despe∣rate from repeated defeats, might possibly make that attempt, at a last effort, vainly flattered with the imaginary hope of assistance in Ireland, from the former attachments of their deluded prede∣cessors. They assured his grace, in the most so∣lemn manner, that such schemes were altogether inconsistent with their principles and intentions: that they would, to the utmost exertion of their abilities, with their lives and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortunes, join in the defence and support of his majesty's royal person and government against all invaders whatsoever: that they should be always ready to concur in such measures, and to act such parts, in defence of the kingdom, in common with the rest of his majesty's subjects, as his grace in his great wisdom should be pleased to appoint; and think themselves parti∣cularly happy to be under the direction and com∣mand of so known an assertor of liberty, such an important and distinguished governor. Finally, they expressed the most earnest wish, that his ma∣jesty's arms might be crowned with such a conti∣nuance of success, as should enable him to defeat the devices of all his enemies, and obtain a speedy and honourable peace.</P>

<P>Although no traces of disaffection to his majesty's family appeared on this trying occasion, it must nevertheless be acknowledged, that a spirit of dis∣satis∣faction
<PB N="125" REF="1250"/>
broke out with extraordinary violence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> among the populace of Dublin. The present lord l—t was not remarkably popular in his administration. He had bestowed one place of con∣siderable importance upon a gentleman whose per∣son was obnoxious to many people in that king∣dom, and perhaps failed in that affability and con∣descension which a free and ferocious nation ex∣pects to find in the character of him to whose rule they are subjected. Whether the offence taken at his deportment had created enemies to his person, or the nation in general began to entertain doubts and jealousies of the government's designs; certain it is, great pains were taken to propagate a belief among the lower sort of people, that an union would soon be effected between Great Britain and Ireland; in which case this last kingdom would be deprived of its parliament and independency, and be sub∣jected to the same taxes that are levied upon the people of England. This notion inflamed the po∣pulace to such a degree, that they assembled in a prodigious multitude, broke into the house of lords, insulted the peers, seated an old woman on the throne, and searched for the journals, which, had they been found, they would have committed to the flames. Not content with this outrage, they compelled the members of both houses whom they met in the streets to take an oath that they would never consent to such an union, or give any vote contrary to the true interest of Ireland. Divers coaches belonging to obnoxious persons were de∣stroyed, and their horses killed; and a gibbet was erected for one gentleman in particular, who nar∣rowly escaped the ungovernable rage of those ri∣otous

Next day addresses to the lord▪lieutenant were agreed to by both houses of parliament, and a committee of inquiry appointed, that the ring▪leaders of the tumult might be discovered and brought to condign punishment.</P>

The greatest encomium that can be given to the character of this partizan, is an account of the alarm which the sailing of his puny armament spread through the whole extent of such a powerful kingdom, whose fleets covered the ocean. Perhaps Thurot's career would have been sooner stopped, had commodore Boys been victualled for a longer cruise; but this com∣mander was obliged to put in at Leith for a supply of provisions, at the very time when Thurot was

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the island of Marti∣nique.</NOTE> Having finished the detail of the actions at∣chieved in the European seas by the naval force of Great Britain, within the compass of the present year, we shall now proceed to record the exploits of the British arms within the tropics, and parti∣cularly the expedition to Martinique and Guada∣lupe, which is said to have succeeded even beyond the expectation of the ministry. A plan had been formed for improving the success of the preceding year in North America, by carrying the British arms up the river St. Laurence, and besieging Que∣bec, the capital of Canada. The armament em∣ployed against the French islands of Martinique and Guadalupe, constituted part of this design; inas∣much as the troops embarked on that expedition were, in case of a miscarriage at Martinique, in∣tended to reinforce the British army in North Ame∣rica, which was justly considered as the chief seat of the war. What hope of success the administration conceived from an attempt upon Martinique, may be guessed from the state of that island, as it ap∣peared in a memorial presented by the French king's lieutenants of its several districts, to the general of the French islands, in consequence of an order issued in November, for holding them in readiness to march and defend the island from the English, of whose design they were apprised. They represented, that the trade with the Dutch was become their sole dependence; that they could expect no succour from Europe, by which they had been abandoned
<PB N="128" REF="1290"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> ever since the commencement of the war: that the traders vested with the privilege of trafficking a∣mong them, had abused the intention of the ge∣neral, and, instead of being of service to the colony, had fixed an arbitrary price for all the provisions they brought in, as well as for the commodities which they exported, of consequence the former was valued at as high a price as their avarice could exact, and the latter sunk as low in value as their own selfish hearts could conceive: that the colony for two months had been destitute of all kinds of provision; the commodities of the planters lay up∣on their hands; and their negroes were in danger of perishing through hunger; a circumstance that excited the apprehension of the most dreadful consequences. As to slaves half▪starved, all kinds of bondage were equal; and people reduced to such a situation were often driven to despair, seeking in anarchy and confusion a remedy from the evils by which they were oppressed: that the best pro∣vided of the inhabitants laboured under the want of the common necessaries of life; and others had not so much as a grain of salt in their houses: that there was an irreparable scarcity of slaves to culti∣vate their lands; and the planters were reduced to the necessity of killing their cattle to support the lives of those who remained alive; so that the mills were no longer worked, and the inhabitants con∣sumed beforehand what ought to be reserved for their sustenance, in case of being blocked up by the enemy. They desired therefore, that the general would suppress the permissions granted to particular merchants, and admit neutral vessels freely into their ports, that they might trade with the colonists un∣molested
<PB N="129" REF="1300"/>
and unrestrained. They observed, that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the citadel of Port Royal seemed the principal ob∣ject on which the safety and defence of the country depended; as the loss of it would be necessarily at∣tended with the reduction of the whole island: they therefore advised that this fort should be pro∣perly provided with every thing necessary for its safety and defence; and that magazines of provision as well as ammunition should be established in dif∣ferent quarters of the island.</P>
<P>This remonstrance plainly proves that the island was wholly unprepared to repel the meditated inva∣sion, and justifies the plan adopted by the minis∣try of Great Britain. The regular troops of Marti∣nique consisted of about twenty independent com∣panies, greatly defective in point of number. The militia was composed of burghers and planters dis∣tressed and dissatisfied, mingled with a parcel of wretched negroe slaves, groaning under the most intolerable misery, from whence they could have no hope of deliverance but by a speedy change of masters; their magazines were empty, and their fortifications out of repair.</P>

On the twel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th day of November, in the preceding year, captain Hughs sailed from St. Helen's, with eight sail of the line, one frigate, four bomb ketches, and a fleet of transports, having on board six regiments of infantry, and a detachment of ar∣tillery, besides eight hundred marines distributed among the ships of war, this whole force being under the command of major-general Hopson, an

After a voy∣age of seven weeks and three days, the sleet arrived at Barbadoes, and anchored in Carlisle-bay, where they joined commodore Moore, who now assumed the command of the united squadrons, amounting to ten ships of the line, besides frigates and bomb-ketches.</P>
<P>Five days were employed in supplying the fleet with wood and water, in reviews, re-embarkations, councils of war, assemblies of the council belong∣ing to the island, in issuing proclamations, and beating up for volunteers. At length, every great ship being reinforced with forty negroes, to be em∣ployed in drawing the artillery; and the troops, which did not exceed five thousand men, being joined by two hundred Highlanders, belonging to the second battalion of the regiment commanded by lord John Murray in North America, who were brought as recruits from Scotland, under convoy of the ship Ludlow-castle, the whole armament<NOTE PLACE="marg">The ar∣mament fails to Marti∣nique.</NOTE> sailed from Carlisle-bay on the thirteenth day of January: but by this time the troops, unaccustom∣ed to a hot climate, were considerably weakened and reduced by severs, diarrhaeas, the scurvy, and the small-pox; which last disease had unhappily broke out amongst the transports. Next morning the squadron discovered the island of Martinique, which was the place of its destination, lying in the latitude of fourteen degrees thirty minutes north, extending about thirteen leagues in length, and seven in breadth, waved into a variety of hills, well
<PB N="131" REF="1320"/>

Marti∣nique is still more considerable by its centrical situation in the midst of the Caribbees▪ by its natural strength, the number of its inhabitants▪ and the advantages it derived from being the seat of go∣vernment and staple of trade, from whence even the sugars of Guadalupe, and other islands, were exported for the European markets. The chief fortification of Martinique was the citadel of Port Royal, a regular fort, garrisoned by four compa∣nies that did not exceed the number of one hun∣dred and fifty men, thirty-six bombardiers, eighty Swiss, and fourteen officers. One hundred barrels of beef constituted their whole store of provision; but they were destitute of all other necessaries. They were almost wholly unprovided with water in the cisterns, with spare carriages for their cannon, match, wadding, and langrage: they had but a small stock of other ammunition, and the walls were in many parts decayed. The only prepara∣tions they had made for receiving the English, were some paultry intrenchments thrown up at St. Pierre, and a place called Casenavire, where they imagined the descent would probably be attempt∣ed. On the fifteenth day of the month the British squadron entered the great bay of Port Royal, some of the ships being exposed to the shot of a battery erected on the Isle de Ranieres, a little island about half way up the bay. At their first

Tyrrel in the Buckingham, then lying under the guns of Fort Negro, along with two frigates, turned up under the Citadel, and came to anchor in the Ca∣renage, behind the fortification. The two frigates, under favour of the night, made their escape through the transports, and directed their course for Europe; where one of them, called the Vestal, was taken by captain Hood, as we have already related.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Descent upon Marti∣nique.</NOTE> Next day three ships of the line were order∣ed to attack Fort Negro, a battery at the dis∣tance of three miles from the Citadel, which, being mounted with seven guns only, was soon silenced, and immediately possessed by a detach∣ment of marines and sailors; who, being landed in flat-bottomed boats, clambered up the rock, and entered through the embra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures with their bayo∣nets fixed: here, however, they met with no re∣sistance. The enemy had abandoned the fort with precipitation. The British colours were imme∣diately hoisted, and centinels of marines posted upon the parapet.

This eminence, called the Morne Tortue∣son, though the most important post of the whole island, was neglected by the general of Martinique, who had also resolved to blow up the fortifications of the Citadel: but, luckily for the islanders, he had not prepared the materials for this operation, which must have been attended with the imme∣diate reduction of the capital, and indeed of the whole country. Some of the inferior officers, knowing the importance of the Morne Tortues<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, resolved to defend that post with a body of the mi∣litia, which was reinforced by the garrisons of Fort Negro and Casenavire, as well as by some soldiers

About two o'clock general Hopson thought proper to desist from his attempt. He gave the commodore to understand, that he could not maintain his ground, unless the squadron would supply him with heavy cannon, landed near the town of Port Royal, or assist him in attacking the Citadel by sea, while he should make his ap∣proaches by land. Both these expedients being deemed impracticable by a council of war, the troops were recalled from their advanced posts, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops are reim∣barked.</NOTE> reimbarked in the evening, without any consider∣able molesta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on from the enemy. Their attempt on the Morne Tortueson had cost them about se∣venty men, including two officers, killed or wound∣ed in the attack; and in revenge for this loss, they burned the sugar-canes, and desolated the country, in their retreat. The inhabitants of Martinique could hardly credit the testimony of their own senses, when they saw themselves thus delivered from all their fears, at a time when they were over∣whelmed with terror and confusion; when the prin∣cipal individuals among them had resigned all thought of further resistance, and were actually as∣sembled at the public hall in Port Royal, to send deputies to the English general with proposals of capitulation and surrender.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="1360"/>
The majority of the British officers who consti∣tuted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the council of war, having given their opi∣nion, that it might be for his majesty's service to make an attack upon St. Pierre, the fleet pro∣ceeded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another attempt upon St. Pierre.</NOTE> to that part of the island, and entered the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on the nineteenth. The commodore told the general, that he made no doubt of being able to reduce the town of St. Pierre; but, as the ships might be disabled in the attack, so as not to be in a condition to proceed immediately on any other material service; as the troops might also be redu∣ced in their numbers, so as to be incapable of fu∣ture attacks; and as the reduction of the island of Guadalupe would be of great benefit to the sugar colonies, Mr. Moore proposed that the armament should immediately proceed to this island; and the general agreed to the proposal.</P>
<P>The reasons produced on this occasion, are, we apprehend, such as may be urged against every operation of war. Certain it is, no conquest can be attempted, either by sea or land, without expo∣sing the ships and troops to a possibility of being disabled and diminished; and the same possibility militated as strongly against an attempt upon Gua∣dalupe, as it could possibly discourage the attack of St. Pierre. Besides, Martinique was an object of greater importance than Guadalupe; as being the principal place possessed by the French in those seas, and that to which the operations of the arma∣ment were expressly limited by the instructions re∣ceived from the m—y.</P>
<P>St. Pierre is a place of considerable commerce; and at this very juncture, above forty sail of mer∣chant-ships
<PB N="136" REF="1370"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> lay at anchor in the bay. The town is desended by a citadel regularly fortified, but at present poorly garrisoned; and so situated as to be accessible to the fire of the whole squadron: for the shore was bold, and the water sufficient to float any ship of the line. Before the resolution of pro∣ceeding to Guadalupe was taken, the commodore had ordered the bay to be sounded, and directed the Rippon to advance, and silence a battery situ∣ated a mile and a half to the northward of St. Pierre. Accordingly captain Harman, who commanded that ship, stood in, and anchoring close to the shore, attacked it with such impetuosity, that in a few minutes it was abandoned. At the same time the Rippon was exposed to the fire of three other batteries, from which she received considerable da∣mage both in her hull and rigging; and was in great danger of running aground, when orders were given to tow her out of danger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleet sails to Guada∣lupe.</NOTE> The whole armament having abandoned the de∣sign on Martinique, directed their course to Gua∣dalupe, another of the Caribbee islands, lying at the distance of thirty leagues to the westward, about fifteen leagues in length, and twelve in breadth; divided into two parts by a small channel, which the inhabitants cross in a ferry-boat. The western division is known by the name of Basse∣terre; and here the metropolis stands, defended by the citadel and other fortifications. The eastern part called Grand-terre, is destitute of fresh water, which abounds in the other division, and is de∣fended by Fort Louis, with a redoubt, which com∣mands the road in the district of Gosier. The gut,
<PB N="137" REF="1380"/>
or canal that separates the two parts, is distin∣guished<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> by the appellation of the Salt River, ha∣ving a road or bay at each end; namely, the great Cul de Sac, and the small Cul de Sac. Guada∣lupe is incumbered with high mountains and pre∣cipices, to which the inhabitants used to convey their valuable effects in time of danger: but here are also beautiful plains, watered by brooks and rivers, which fertilize the soil, enabling it to pro∣duce a great quantity of sugar, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and cassia; besides plenty of rice, pota∣toes, all kinds of pulse and fruit peculiar to the island. The country is populous and flourishing, and the government comprehends two smaller islands, cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed All Saints, and Deseada, which ap∣pear at a small distance from the coast, on the eastern side of the island.</P>
<P>The British squadron having arrived at Basse∣terre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The town, ci∣tadel, and batteries at Basse∣terre, can∣nonaded.</NOTE> a council of war was held on board of the commodore's ship; where it was resolved to make a general attack by sea, upon the citadel, the town, and other batteries by which it was defended. A disposition being made for this purpose, the large ships took their respective stations next morning, which was the twenty-third day of January. At nine, the Lyon, commanded by captain Trelaw∣ney, began the engagement against a battery of ninety guns; and the rest of the fleet continued to place themselves a-breast of the other batteries and the citadel, which mounted forty-six cannon, besides two mortars. The action in a little time became ge∣neral, and was maintained on both sides <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or several hours with great vivacity: while the commodore,
<PB N="138" REF="1390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> who had shifted his flag into the Woolwich srigate, kept aloof without gunshot, that he might be the more disengaged to view the state of the battle, and give his orders with the greater deliberation.</P>
<P>This expedient of an admiral's removing his flag, and retiring from the action while his own ship is engaged, howsoever consonant to reason, we do not remember to have seen practised upon any other occasion, except in one instance at Car∣thagena, where Sir Chaloner Ogle quitted his own ship, when she was ordered to stand in and can∣nonade the fort of Bocca Chica.</P>
<P>In this present attack, all the sea commanders behaved with extraordinary spirit and resolution, particularly the captains Leslie, Burnet, Gayton, Jekyl, Trelawney, and Shuldam; who, in the hot∣test tumult of the action, distinguished themselves equally by their courage, impetuosity, and delibe∣ration. About five in the afternoon, the fire of the citadel was exhausted. The Burford and Ber∣wick were driven out to sea; so that captain Shul∣dam in the Panther was unsustained; and two batteries played upon the Rippon, captain Jekyl, who, by two in the afternoon, silenced the guns of one called the Morne-rouge; but at the same time could not prevent his ship from running a ground. The enemy perceiving her disaster, assembled in great numbers on the hill, and lined the trenches, from whence they poured in a severe fire of mus∣quetry. The militia afterwards brought up a can∣non of eighteen pound ball; and for two hours raked her fore and aft with considerable effect: nevertheless, captain Jekyl returned the fire with
<PB N="139" REF="1400"/>
equal courage and perseverance, though his people<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> dropt on every side, until all his grape-shot and wadding was expended, and all his rigging cut to pieces: to crown his misfortune, a box contain∣ing nine hundred cartridges, blew up on the poop, and set the ship on fire; which, however, was soon extinguished. In the mean time, the cap∣tain threw out a signal of distress; to which no regard was payed, till captain Leslie of the Bri∣stol coming from sea, and observing his situation, ran in between the Rippon and the battery; and engaged with such impetuosity, as made an im∣mediate diversion in favour of captain Jekyl, whose ship remained a-ground▪ notwithstanding all the as∣sistance that could be given, till mid-night, when she floa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and escaped from the very jaws of de∣struction. At seven in the evening, all the other large ships having silenced the guns to which they had been respectively opposed, he joined the rest of the fleet. The four bombs being anchored near the shore, began to ply the town with shells and carcasses; so that in a little time the houses were in flames, the magazines of gun-powder blew up with the most terrible explosion; and about ten o'clock the whole place blazed out one general conflagration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops land.</NOTE> Next day at two in the afternoon, the fleet came to an anchor in the road of Basse-terre, where they found the hulls of divers ships which the ene∣my had set on fire at their approach: several ships turned out and endeavoured to escape; but were intercepted and taken by the English squadron. At five the troops landed without opposition, and took possession of the town and citadel, which they
<PB N="140" REF="1410"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> found entirely abandoned. They learned from a Genoese de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the regular troops of the island consisted of five companies only, the num∣ber of the whole not exceeding one hundred men; and that they had laid a train to blow up the pow∣der magazine in the citadel; but had been obli∣ged to retreat with such precipitation, as did not permit them to execute this design. The train was immediately cut off, and the magazine secured. The nails with which they had spiked up their can∣non, were drilled out by the matrosses; and in the mean time▪ the British colours were hoisted on the parapet. Part of the troops took possession of an advantageous post on an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minence, and part en∣tered the town, which still continued burning with great violence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor of Gua∣dalupe re∣fuses to capitu∣late.</NOTE> In the morning, at day break, the enemy ap∣peared, to the number of two thousand, about four miles from the town, and began to throw up in∣trenchments in the neighbourhood of a house where the governor had fixed his head-quarters, declaring he would maintain his ground to the last extremity. To this resolution indeed he was encouraged by the nature of the ground, and the neighbourhood of a pass called the Dos d'Ane, a cleft through a mountainous ridge, opening a communication with Capestre, a more level and beautiful part of the island. The ascent from Basse-terre to this pass was so very steep, and the way so broken and in∣terrupted by rocks and gullies, that there was no prospect of attacking it with success, except at the first landing, when the inhabitants were under the dominion of a pannic.

<P>I have received the letter which your excellencies have done me the honour to write of the twenty-fifth. You make me proposals which could arise from nothing but the facility with which you have got possession of the little town and citadel of Basse-terre; for otherwise you ought to do me the justice to believe they could not be received. You have strength sufficient to subdue the exte∣riors of the island; but with respect to the interiors, the march between us is equal. As to the consequences that may attend my refusal, I am persuaded they will be no other than such as are pre∣scribed by the laws of war. Should we be disappointed in this particular, we have a master powerful enough to revenge any injury we may sustain. I am, with respect, gentlemen, your most obe∣dient servant,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It is pretty remarkable, that the apprehe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on of cruel usage from the English, who are undoubtedly the most generous and humane enemies under the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, not on∣ly prevailed among the com∣mon French soldiery through∣out this whole war, but even infected officers of distinction, who ought to have been ex∣empted from these prejudices, by a better acquaintance with life, and a more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of thinking.</P></NOTE>. Indeed from the beginning his deportment had been such as gave a very unfavourable impression of his cha∣racter. When the British squadron advanced to the attack, instead of visiting in person the citadel and the batteries, in order to encourage and ani∣mate his people by his exhortation and example,
<PB N="142" REF="1430"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> he retired out of the reach of danger to a distant plantation, where he remained a tame spectator of the destruction in which his principal town and ci∣tadel were involved. Next morning, when he ought to have exerted himself in preventing the disembar∣kation of the English troops, who had a difficult shore and violent surf to surmount, and when he might have defended the entrenchments and lines which had been made to oppose their landiug; he abandoned all these advantages, and took shelter among the mountains that were deemed inacces∣sible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Skir∣mishes with the islanders.</NOTE> But howsoever deficient the governor might have been in the article of courage, certain it is the inhabitants behaved with great spirit and activity in defence of their country. They continually har∣rassed the scouring detachments, by firing upon them from woods and sugar plantations, which last the English burned about their ears in resentment. Their armed negroes were very expert in this kind of bush-fighting. The natives or militia appeared in considerable parties, and even encountered de∣tached bodies of the British army. A lady of mas∣culine courage, whose name was Ducharmey, hav∣ing armed her slaves, headed them in person, made several bold attempts upon an advanced post, oc∣cupied by major Melville, and threw up entrench∣ments upon a hill opposite to the station of this of∣ficer, who had all along signalized himself by his uncommon intrepidity, vigilance, and conduct. At length the works of this virago were stormed by a regular detachment, which, after an obsti∣nate and dangerous conflict, entered the entrench∣ment sword in hand, and burned the houses and
<PB N="143" REF="1440"/>
plantations; but the lady, who commanded in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> person during the action, escaped with some dif∣ficulty. Some of the enemy were killed, and a good number taken: of the English detachment twelve soldiers were slain, and thirty wounded, in∣cluding three subaltern officers, one of whom lost his arm. The greatest body of the enemy al∣ways appeared at the governor's head-quarters, where they had raised a redoubt, and thrown up intrenchments. From these a considerable detach∣ment advanced on the sixth day of February, in the morning, towards the citadel, and fell in with an English party, whom they engaged with great vi∣vacity; but after a short, though warm dispute, they were obliged to retire with some loss. With∣out all doubt the inhabitants of Guadalupe pursued the most sensible plan that could possibly have been projected for their own safety. Instead of hazard∣ing a general engagement with regular troops, in which they could have no prospect of success, they resolved to weary them out, by maintaining a kind of petty war in separate parties, to alarm and har∣rass the English with hard duty in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ultry climate, where they were but indifferently supplied with provision and refreshment. Nor were their hopes in this particular disappointed. Both the army and navy were invaded with fevers and other diseases epidemical in those hot countries; and the regi∣mental hospitals were so crouded, that it was judged convenient to send five hundred sick men to the island of Antigua, where they might be properly attended.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the reduction of the islanders on the side of Guadalupe appearing more and more
<PB N="144" REF="1450"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> impracticable, the general resolved to transfer the seat of war to the eastern and more fertile part of the island, called Grand-terre, which, as we have already observed, was defended by a strong battery, called Fort Louis. In pursuance of this determi∣nation, the great ships were sent round to Grand-terre, in order to reduce this fortification, which they accordingly attacked on the thirteenth day of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort Louis re∣duced.</NOTE> February. After a severe cannonading, which lasted six hours, a body of marines being landed, with the Highlanders, they drove the enemy from their intrenchments sword-in-hand, and, taking possession of the fort, hoisted the English colours.</P>
<P>In a few days after this exploit, general Hopson dying at Basse-terre, the chief command devolved to general Barrington, who resolved to prosecute the final reduction of the island with vigour and dispatch. As one step towards this conquest, the commodore ordered two ships of war to cruize off the island of St. Eus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atia, and prevent the Dutch traders from assisting the natives of Guadalupe; whom they had hitherto cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antly supplied with provisions, since they retired to the mountains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops re∣imbarked at Basse-terre.</NOTE> General Barrington, on the very first day of his command, ordered the troops, who were encamped to strike their tents and hutt, that the enemy might imagine he intended to remain in this quarter; but in a few days, the batteries in and about Basse-terre were blown up and destroyed, the detach∣ments recalled from the advanced posts, and the whole army reimbarked, except one regiment, with a detachment of artillery, left in garrison at the citadel; the command of which was bestowed on colonel Debrisay, an accomplished officer of great
<PB N="145" REF="1460"/>
experience. The enemy no sooner p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rceived the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> coast clear than they descended from the hills, and endeavoured to take possession of the town, from which however they were driven by the fire of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itadel. They afterwards erected a battery, from whence they annoyed this fortification both with shot and shells, and even threatened a regular at∣tack; but, as often as they approached the place, they were repulsed by sallies from the castle. In the midst of these hostilities, the gallant Debrisay, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fate of col. De∣brisay.</NOTE> together with major Trollop, one lieutenant, two bombardiers, and several common soldiers, were blown up, and perished by the explosion of a pow∣der magazine at the flanked angle of the south-east bastion. The confusion necessarily produced by such an unfortunate accident, encouraged the enemy to come pouring down from the hills, in or∣der to make their advantage of the disaster; but they were soon repulsed by the fire of the garrison. The general, being made acquainted with the fate of colonel Debrisay, conferred the government of the fort upon major Melvil, and sent thither the thief engineer to repair and improve the fortifica∣tions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The squa∣dron sails to Domi∣nique.</NOTE> In the mean time, commodore Moore having received certain intelligence that mons▪ de Bom∣part had arrived at Martinique with a squadron, consisting of eight sail of the line and three fri∣gates, having on board a whole battalion of Swiss, and some other troops, to reinforce the garrisons of the islands, he called in his cruisers, and sailed immediately to the bay of Dominique, an island to the windward, at the distance of nine leagues from Guadalupe, whence he could always sail to oppose
<PB N="146" REF="1470"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> any designs which the French commander might form against the operations of the British arma∣ments. For what reason Mr. Moore did not sail immediately to the bay of Port Royal in Marti∣nique, where he knew the French squadron lay at anchor, we shall not pretend to determine. Had he taken that step, Mr. Bompart must either have given him battle, or retired into the Carenage, be∣hind the Citadel; in which last case, the English commander might have anchored between Pidgeon∣island and Fort Negro, and thus blocked him up effectually. By retiring to Dominique, he left the sea open to French privateers, who roved along the coasts of these islands, and in a very little time carried into Martinique above fourscore merchant∣ships belonging to the subjects of Great Britain. These continual depredations, committed under the nose of the E—c—e, irritated the planters of the English islands, some of whom are said to have circulated unfavourable reports of that gentle∣man's character.</P>
<P>General Barrington, being left with no more than one ship of forty guns for the protection of the transports, formed a plan of prosecuting the war in Guadalupe by detachments, and the success fully answered his expectation. He determined to make a descent on the division of the island called Grande-terre, and for that purpose allotted six hundred men; who, under the command of colo∣nel Crump, landed between the towns of St. Anne and St. François, and destroyed some batteries of the enemy, from whom he sustained very little op∣position. While he was thus employed, a detach∣ment of three hundred men attacked the town of
<PB N="147" REF="1480"/>
Gosier, which, notwithstanding a severe fire, they<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> took by storm, drove the garrison into the woods, set fire to the place, and demolished the battery and intrenchment raised for its defence.</P>
<P>This service being happily performed, the detach∣ment was ordered to force their way to Fort Louis, while the garrison of that castle was directed to make two sallies, in order to favour their irruption. They accordingly penetrated with some loss, suf∣tained in forcing a strong pass, and took possession of a battery, which the enemy had raised against the English camp, in the neighbourhood of Fort Louis.</P>
<P>The general, having hitherto succeeded in his designs, formed the scheme of surprising at one time the three towns of Petit-bourg, Gonoyave, and St. Mary, situated on the Basse-terre side of the little Cul de Sac, and committed the execution of it to the colonels Crump and Clavering: but the night appointed for the service, proved exceeding dark and tempestuous, and the Negro conductors were so frightened, that they ran several of the flat∣bottomed boats on the shoals that skirt this part of the island. Colonel Clavering landed with about eighty men; but found himself so entangled with mangrove trees, and the mud so impassably deep, that he was obliged to reimbark, though not before the enemy had discovered his design.</P>
<P>This project having miscarried, the general de∣tached the same commanders, whose gallantry and conduct cannot be sufficiently applauded, with a detachment of fifteen hundred men, including one hundred and fifty volunteers from Antigua, to land in a bay not far from the town of Arnouville, at the
<PB N="148" REF="1490"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> bottom of the little Cul de Sac, under the protec∣tion of his majesty's ship the Woolwich. The ene∣my made no opposition to their landing; but re∣treated, as the English advanced, to a strong in∣trenchment thrown up behind the river Lecorne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Eng∣lish storm the diffi∣cult <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost of Le∣corne.</NOTE> a post of the utmost importance, as it covered the whole country as far as the bay Mahaut, where provisions and supplies of all sorts were landed from St. Eustatia. The river was rendered inac∣cessible by a morass, covered with mangroves, ex∣cept at two narrow passes, which they had fortified with a redoubt, and intrenchments well pallisaded, mounted with cannon, and defended by a numerous militia: besides, the narrow roads, through which only they could be attacked, were interfected with deep and wide ditches. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, the English commanders determined to hazard an assault. While four field-pieces and two howitzers maintained a constant fire upon the top of the intr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nchments, the regiment of Duroure and the Highlanders advanced under this cover, firing by platoons with the utmost regularity. The enemy, intimidated by their cool and resolute beha∣viour, began to abandon the first intrenchment on the left. Then the Highlanders, drawing their swords, and sustained by part of the regiment, threw themselves in with their usual impetuosity, and followed the fugitives pell-mell into the re∣doubt, of which they took possession: but they still maintained their ground within the intrenchments on the right, from whence they annoyed the as∣sailants both with musquetry and cannon. In half an hour, an occasional bridge being made, the English troops passed the river, in order to attack
<PB N="149" REF="1500"/>
this post, which the enemy abandoned with preci∣pitation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> notwithstanding all their haste, however, about seventy were taken prisoners, and among these some of the most considerable inhabitants of the island. This advantage cost the English two officers and thirteen men killed, and above fifty wounded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They take Petit∣bourg, and St. Mary's.</NOTE> The roads being mended for the passage of the artillery, the troops advanced towards Petit-bourg, harrassed in their march by flying bodies of the enemy, and arrived late at night on the banks of the river Lizarde, the only ford of which the French had fortified with strong intrenchments, protected by a battery of four cannon, erected on a rising ground in the rear. Colonel Clavering, while he amused them all night at this place by a constant fire into their lines, transported in two canoes, which he launched about a mile and a half farther down the river, a sufficient number of troops, by day-break, to attack them on the other side in flank, while he should advance in front at the head of his little army; but they did not think proper to sustain the assault. On the contrary, they no sooner perceived his intention than they forsook the post, and fled without order. Colonel Clavering, having passed the river, pursued them to Petit-bourg, which they had also fortified; and here he found captain Uvedale, of the Grenada bomb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ketch, throwing shells into the redoubt. He forthwith sent detachments to occupy the neigh∣bouring heights; a circumstance which the enemy no sooner observed than they deserted the place, and retired with great expedition. On the fif∣teenth day of April captain Steel, destroyed a bat∣tery
<PB N="150" REF="1510"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> at Guoyave, a strong post, which, though it might have been defended against an army, the French abandoned at his approach, after having made a hasty discharge of their artillery. At the same time colonel Crump was detached with seven hundred men to the bay of Mahaut, where he burned the town and batteries, which he found abandoned, together with a vast quantity of pro∣visions, which had been brought from the island of St. Eustatia. Colonel Clavering, having left a small garrison at Petit▪bourg, began his march on the twentieth day of the month towards St. Ma∣ry's, where he understood the enemy had col∣lected their whole force, thrown up intrenchments, and raised barricadoes; but they had left their rear unguarded. The English commander immediate∣ly detached colonel Barlow with a body of troops to attack them from that quarter, while he him∣self advanced against the front of their intrench∣ment. They stood but one cannon-shot, and fled to their lines and batteries at St. Mary's, the flanks of which were covered with woods and precipices. When they perceived the English troops endea∣vouring to surmount these difficulties, and turn their lines, they quitted them, in order to oppose the design; and were immediately attacked with such vivacity, in the face of a severe fire of mus∣quetry and cannon, that they abandoned their ground, and fled in the utmost confusion, leaving the field and all their artillery to the victors, who took up their quarters for the night at St. Mary's.</P>
<P>Next day they entered the charming country of Capesterre, where eight hundred and seventy Ne∣groes belonging to one planter, surrendered at

Here colonel Clavering was met by<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> messieurs de Clainvilliers and Duqueruy, deputed by the principal inhabitants of the island, to know what capitulation would be granted. These he conducted to Petit-bourg, where they were pre∣sented to general Barrington, who, considering the absence of the fleet, the small number of his forces, daily diminishing, the difficulty of the country, and the possibility of the enemy's being reinforced from Martinique, wisely took the advantage of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The island surren∣dered on capitula∣tion.</NOTE> their present pannic, and settled the terms of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Articles of Capitulation between their Exceliencies the Hon.

in their camp with information, that Mr. de Beau∣harnois,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the general of the French islands, had landed at St. Anne's, to the windward, with a re∣inforcement from Martinique, consisting of six hundred regulars from Europe, and about two thousand buccaneers, with a great supply of arms and ammunition, mortars and artillery, under con∣voy of the squadron commanded by Mr. de Bom∣part.

<P><PB N="156" REF="1570"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Thus we see that the conquest of this important island, which is said to produce a greater quantity
<PB N="157" REF="1580"/>
of sugar than is made in all the English plantations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> was as much owing to accident as to the valour of the troops and the conduct of the general: for,
<PB N="158" REF="1590"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> had the reinforcement arrived an hour sooner than it actually landed, in all probability the English would have found it impracticable to finish the re∣duction of Guadalupe. Be that as it may, the na∣tives certainly deserved great commendations, not only for persevering so gallantly in defence of their country, but also for their fortitude in bearing every species of distress. They now quieted the Dos d'Ane, and all their other posts, and returned to their respective habitations.</P>
<P>The town of Basse-terre being reduced to a heap of ashes, the inhabitants began to clear away the rubbish, and erected occasional sheds, where they resumed their several occupations with that good humour so peculiar to the French nation; and ge∣neral Barrington humanely indulged them with all the assistance in his power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deseada, Los San∣tos▪ and Mariga∣lante sub∣mit.</NOTE> Immediately after the capitulation of Guada∣lupe, he summoned the islands called Santos and Deseadea to surrender; and they, together with Petit-terre, submitted on the same terms which he had granted to the great island: but his proposal was rejected by the inhabitants of Marigalante, which lies about three leagues to the south east of Grande terre, extending twenty miles in length, fifteen in breadth, flat and fertile, but poorly wa∣tered, and ill-fortified. The general, resolving to reduce it by force, embarked a body of troops on board of transports, which sailed thither under convoy of three ships of war and two bomb-ves∣sels from Prince Rupert's Bay; and at their ap∣pearance the islanders submitting, received an En∣glish garrison.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="1600"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Before this period, commodore Moore having received intelligence that Mr. de Bompart had sailed from Martinique, with design to land a re∣inforcement on Guadalupe, and that his squadron was seen at sea seven leagues to windward of Ma∣rigalante, he sailed from Prince Rupert's Bay, and turned to windward; but bringing to about noon, he fell to leeward, and lost as much in the day as he had gained in the night. After having been beaten about for five days, to very little purpose, he received notice from one of his cruisers, that the French admiral had returned to Martinique; upon which informarion he retired quietly to his former station in the bay of Dominique: the people of which were so insolent as to affirm, in derision, that the English squadron sailed on one side of the island, and the French upon the other, that they might be sure of not meeting: but this, without doubt, was an impudent calumny.</P>
<P>General Barrington, having happily finished the conquest of Guadalupe, gave notice to the com∣modore, that he intended to send back part of the troops with the transports to England, about the beginning of July. In consequence of this inti∣mation, Mr. Moore sailed with his squadron to Basse-terre road, where he was next day joined by two ships of the line from England, which ren∣dered him greatly superior in strength to the com∣mander of the French squadron, who at this time retired to the island of Granada, lying about eight leagues from Guadalupe. Here he was discovered by the ship Rippon, whose captain returned im∣mediately to Basse-terre, to make the commodore acquainted with this circumstance: but, before he
<PB N="160" REF="1610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> could weigh anchor, a frigate arrived with informa∣tion that Bompart had quitted Granada, and was supposed to have directed his course to Hispaniola. The commodore immediately dispatched the Lud∣low▪castle with this intelligence to admiral Cotes, who commanded the squadron at Jamaica.</P>
<P>General Barrington having made a tour of the island, in order to visit and repair the fortifications which he thought necessary to be maintained, and the affairs relating to the inhabitants being intirely settled, he sent the Highlanders, with a body of draughts, to North America, under convoy: he garrisoned the principal strengths of the island▪ and left the chief command to colonel Crump, who had for some time acted as brigad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er-general, colo∣nel Clavering having been sent home to England with the account of the capitulation. Colonel Melville, who had signalized himself in a remark∣able manner ever since their first landing, conti∣nued governor of the citadel at Basse-terre; and the command at Grande terre was conferred on colonel Delgarno. Three compleat regiments were allotted as a sufficient guard for the whole island, and the other three were embarked for England.<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Barring∣ton re∣turns to England.</NOTE> General Barrington himself went on board the Roebuck in the latter end of June, and with the transports, under convoy of captain Hughes, and a small squadron, set sail for Great-Britain; while commodore Moore, with his larger fleet, directed his course to Antigua.</P>
<P>While this armament had been employed in the conquest of Guadalupe, North America exhibited still more sanguinary scenes of war and devastation, which, in order properly to introduce, it will be
<PB N="161" REF="1620"/>
necessary to explain the steps that were taken on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> this continent, previous to this campaign. In Octo∣ber of the preceding year, a grand assembly was held at Easton, about ninety miles from Philadel∣phia; and there peace was established by a formal treaty, between Great-Britain and the several Na∣tions <NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with the Indians in North America.</NOTE> of Indians inhabiting the country between the Apalachian mountains and the lakes. The Twightwees, however, settled between the river Ohio and the lakes, did not assist at this treaty, though some steps had been taken towards an al∣liance with that people. The conferences were managed by the governors of Pensylvania and New Jersey▪ accompanied by Sir William John∣son's deputy for Indian affairs, four members of the council of Pensylvania, six members of the assembly, two agents for the province of New Jer∣sey, a great number of planters, and citizens of Philadelphia, chiefly quakers. They were met by the deputies and chiefs of the Mohawks, Onei∣does, Onondagoes, Cayugas, Senecas, Tuscaroras, Nanticoques, and Conoys, the Tuteloes, Chugnuts, Delawares, and Unamies, the Minisinks, Mohi∣cons, and Wappingers; the whole number, includ∣ing their women and children, amounting to five hundred.</P>
<P>Some of the Six Nations, thinking themselves aggrieved by the British colonists, who had impri∣soned some individuals of their nation, killed a few, and treated others with contempt, did not fail to express their resentment, which had been art∣fully fomented by the French emissaries, even into an open rupture. The Delawares and Minisinks, in particular, complained that the English had en∣croached
<PB N="162" REF="1630"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> upon their lands, and on that account were provoked to hostilities: but their chief, Tee∣dyuscung, had made overtures of peace; and, in the character of ambassador from all the ten na∣tions, had been very instrumental in forming this assembly. The chiefs of the Six Nations, though very well disposed to peace, took umbrage at the importance assumed by one of the Delawares, over whom, as their descendants, they exercised a kind of parental authority; and on this occasion they made no scruple to disclose their dissatisfaction. The business therefore of the English governors, at this congress, was to ascertain the limits of the lands in dispute, reconcile the Six Nations with their nephews the Delawares, remove every cause of misunderstanding between the English and the In∣dians, detach these savages intirely from the French interest, establish a firm peace, and induce them to exert their influence in persuading the Twigh∣twees to accede to this treaty. Those Indians, though possessed of few ideas, circumscribed in their mental faculties, stupid, brutal, and fero∣cious, conduct themselves, nevertheless, in matters of importance to the community, by the general maxims of reason and justice; and their treaties are always founded upon good sense conveyed in a very ridiculous manner. Their language is gut∣tural, harsh, and polysyllabical; and their speech consists of hyperbolical metaphors and similes, which invest it with an air of dignity, and heighten the expression. They manage their conferences by means of wampum, a kind of bead, formed of hard shell, either in single strings, or sewed in broad belts of different dimensions, according to

the importance of the subject. Every proposition<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> is offered, every answer made, every promise cor∣roborated, every declaration attested, and every treaty confirmed, by producing and interchanging these belts of wampum <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The reader will con∣ceive an idea of these people, and their customs, by a few extracts from the journal of their conferences. When the governor of Philadelphia and his council arrived at Easton, they were welcomed by Tee∣dyuscung, chief of the Dela∣wares, with the following compliment.</P>
<P>`Brother, you desire me to hollow loud, and give notice to all the Indians round a∣bout. I have raised my voice, and all the Indians have heard me as far as the Twightwees, and have regarded my voice, and are now come to this place. I bid you welcome, and entreat you to join with me in casting up our eyes to heaven, and praying the bles∣sing of the supreme being on our endeavours. According to our usual custom, I with this string wipe the dust and sweat off your face, and clear your eyes, and pick the briars out of your legs; and desire you will pick the briars out of the legs of the Indians that are come here, and anoint one of them with your heal∣ing oil, and I will anoint the other. <BIBL>A string.'</BIBL></P>
<P>In the subsequent confe∣rences, Tokaaio, chief of the Cayugas, spoke to the follow∣ing effect:</P>
<P>`A road has been opened for us to this council fire; but by some misfortune, blood has lately been spilt upon that road. By these strings we wash that blood away, and take the hatchet out of your heads. <BIBL>Three strings.</BIBL></P>
<P>Brethren, I now speak on∣ly for my own nation, I will hide nothing from you; the French, like a thief in the night, have stolen some of our young men, and corrupt∣ed them to do mischief. Our chiefs held them fast, but the French artfully unloosed them; we take out of your heads the hatchet with which they have struck you, and are sorry for what they have done.</P>
<BIBL>A belt of 10 rows.'</BIBL>
<P>The Mohawk chiefs hav∣ing finished their speech, as counsellors, their warriors spoke by the mouth of Tho∣mas King:</P>
<P>`Brethren, you have been desirous to know the true cause of the war, and of the bitterness of our hearts. Look well about you, and you will find you ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the first offence. In time of profound peace, some of the Shawanese passing through S. Carolina to go to war with their enemies, as their yearly custom is, were persuaded in a friendly man∣ner into your houses, deceit∣fully and unjustifiably dragged to prison, where one, who was a head man, lest h s life, and the others were severely used. This first raised ill-will in the minds of the Shawanese; the French aggravated the of∣fence; put the hatchet into their hands to revenge the blood of their brother; they besought the Delawares to join them to make the blow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all the heavier; and by de∣gress the young men among us were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red to vengeance.</P>
<P>Brethen▪ this was the case of the Shawanese. Another of the like nature happened about three years ago to the Sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as, when eight of their warriors were returning from war▪ with seven prisoners and seales with them, through Virginia; these, at a place called Green Briar, met a party of soldiers, not less than 150, who kindly invited them to a certain store, and said, they would supply them with provisions; two days they travelled with them in a friendly manner, but when they came to the house on the third, they began to dis∣arm them; the head man cried out, Here is death; de∣fend yourselves; two of them were killed on the spot, and one, a boy, was taken priso∣ner. As this was upon the warriors road in time of pro∣found peace, judge ye of the degree of provocation. Bre∣thren, you have justly de∣manded your prisoners; it is right so to do; and, if this unhappy boy is alive, as we have reason to think he is, we desire you may return him. If he is dead, we are content. His name is Squissatago.</P>
<BIBL>Six strings of wampum.</BIBL>
<P>Brethren, the cause why the Indians at Ohio left you was owing to yourselves; when we heard of the French coming there, we desired the governors of Virginia and Pensylvania to supply us with implements and necessaries for war, and we would defend our lands; but these gover∣nors disregarded our message; the French came to us; trad∣ed with our people; used them kindly; and gained their affections. The gover∣nor of Virginia settled on our lands for his own benefit; but when we wanted his assist∣ance, he forsook us. <BIBL>A belt.</BIBL></P>
<P>Brother, [addressing him∣self to the governor of Jersey] our cousins the Minisinks tell us, they were wronged of a great deal of land, and pushed back by the English settling so fast upon them, so as not to know whether they have any lands or no. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild creatures, and will not let us come on your lands so much as to bunt after them; you will not let us peel a sin∣gle tree. Surely, this is hard. You take of us what lands you please, and the cattle you raise on them are your own; but those that are wild are still ours, and should be com∣mon to both; for our ne∣phews when they sold the land, did not purpose to deprive themselves of hunting the wild deer, or using a stick of wood. We desire you, the governor, to take this matter into your care, and see justice done to the Minisinks.'</P>

<P>Addressing himself to the governor of Pensylvania, he said, `Brother, we must put you in mind, that four years ago, you bought at Albany a large tract of land, for a part of which that was settled, the proprietaries agents then paid 1000 pieces of eight. We ac∣knowledge the receipt of that money, and the valicity of so much of the purchase; but for the other part that was not paid for, that we reclaim. Our warriors, our hunters, when they heard of this vast sale, disapproved our conduct in council; in the deed ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hunting grounds are includ∣ed, and without them we must perish. <BIBL>Three s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings.'</BIBL></P>

<P>Teedyuscung.] `About three years ago, nine of my countrymen were killed near Goshan in time of peace, for no other reason than because they were hunting upon that land; one of their brethren assures me, that he then went with tears in his eyes to George Freeland, and pre∣sented him with three belts to have the matter cleared up; but has never received an answer to this day. I give you this string to enquire what is become of these belts.</P>
<BIBL>Three string<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of white wampum.</BIBL>

<P>Teedyuscung then took up another belt, intending to speak to his uncles the Unit∣ed Nations; but whilst he was speaking, as above, the chiefs had one after another left the council, seemingly much displeased; he there∣fore held his peace.</P>
<P>Thursday, Oct. 19. At a private council gov.

The United Nations said it was a kind proposal, and recommended it to the consideration of the Minisinks.</P>

Denny at his house, and acquainted him, that his na∣tion did not claim lands high up the Delaware river; those, he said, belonged to his un∣cles; of which he desired the governor to take notice, that no misunderstanding might arise from what had been said at the public council.</P>
<P>Friday, Oct. 20. Gov. Den∣ny desired to know of Tee∣dyuscung, if he proposed to speak, as the abrupt depar∣ture of the Six Nation chiefs had interrupted his discourse the day before.</P>
<P>Teedyuscung.] `Uncles, ac∣cording to the ancient custom, we used to speak one to an∣other at home; but now I must speak to you in the pre∣sence of the English gover∣nors. You may remember that you have placed us at Wyomink and Shamokin; places where Indians have liv∣ed before. Now I hear since, that you have sold that land to our brethren the English; let this matter be now cleared up. I sit like a bird on a bough. I look about and do not know where I may be driven to. Let me therefore come down upon the ground, and make that my own by a deed, and I shall have a home for ever; for if you, my un∣cles, or I die, our brethren the English will say they have bought it from you, and so wrong my posterity out of it. <BIBL>A belt.'</BIBL></P>
<P>Governor Denny having satisfied them for the lands in dispute, by the payment of one thousand dollars, and every objection to the general peace being happily removed, Tagashata, a Mohawk chief, rose up, and addressing him∣self to the Delawares, said.</P>
<P>`Nephews, now you must remember the friendship be∣tween you and your brethren the English, and transmit it to your children; and make them acquainted with the transactions of this day; it should seem that your grand-fathers forgot the treaties they used to make with their brethren, and buried them with them in the grave. Give over all further thoughts of your lands; and take care, that your young men do no more violence to their bre∣thren the English.'</P>
<P>Then Egohohowen (the Minisink chief) addressed himself to the governor, and said, We are now satisfied, and we still retain a friend∣ship for the English; and we desire that if we should come into your province to see our old friends, and should have occasion for the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of a tree to cover a cabin, or a little re∣freshment, that we should not be denied, but be treated as brethren; and that your peo∣ple may not look on the wild beasts of the forest, or fish of the waters, as their sole pro∣perty, but that we may be ad∣mitted to an equal use of them.'</P>
<P>The governor answered, that as soon as he got home, he should notify the peace thro' all the provinces by pro∣clamation; but desired the Indians might not go into those parts where they had so lately committed hosti∣lities, till the passions of the people were cooled; for that he could not answer for his people's behaviour, while their sufferings were fresh up∣on their minds.</P>

<P>Tokaaio and the Six Na∣tion chief st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d up and said, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I thank you for your openness and honesty in free∣ly acknowledging the truth.

They have called us down to a council fire, to bright<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the chain of friend∣ship; but our time is taken up in a fruitless dispute about lands, <HI>without coming to the main point.</HI> The English first began to do mischief; we told them so. They only thanked us for our frankness; but they healed no wounds. In short, when they speak to us, they do it with a shorter belt and string, than that which we speak to them with, though they can make wampum, and we cannot. They ought not thus to treat with Indians in council affairs. Several of our strong belts are lost in their hands. I fear they speak only from their mouth, and not from the heart.</P>
<P>Sunday, Oct. 22. The Six Nation chiefs held a private council, and named two of their people to send to the Ohio. Frederic Post arrived with the news from general Forbes, that a large body of French and Indians having attacked his advanced post at Loyal Hanning, were repuls∣ed with great loss, which loss he communicated to the In∣dians.</P>
<P>Monday, Oct. 23. Gover∣nor Denny.] `Brethren, by this belt we heal your wounds; we remove your grief; we take the hatchet out of your heads; we make a deep hole in the earth and bury the hatchet so low, that nobody shall be able to dig it up again. <BIBL>A b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</BIBL></P>
<P>Brethren, now we have healed your wounds: we by this belt renew all our trea∣ties; we brighten the chain of friendship; we return to our first affection; we con∣firm our ancient union: we put fresh earth to the roots of the tree of peace, that it may bear up against every storm that can blow, and live and flourish to the end of time whilst the sun shines, and the rivers run.

<P>Brethren, we now open a road to the old council fire at Philadelphia, and be assured, we shall always be glad to see you there. <BIBL>A belt.</BIBL></P>

<P>Brethren, as a token of our love, we present you with a quantity of goods, and desire your acceptance of them; sensible of the approaching season, and of the many dif∣ficulties you live under from the present war, we give it with a hearty good will.</P>
<P>Brother Teedyuscung, you put me in mind of your hav∣ing referred your dispute to the great king, and you de∣sired to know if he has de∣cided it; you may depend up∣on it, that as soon as his ans∣wer can be obtained, it shall be com municatedto you.'</P>
<BIBL>A belt.</BIBL>
<P>Then governor Barnard, requesting the attention of the Indians, acquainted them, that in consequence of their advice, he had come to a full agreement with the Minisinks, for all the lands in dispute on the part of his province, to which he desired they would pay a particular regard, that the remembrance of it might never be forgotten. <BIBL>A belt.</BIBL></P>
<P>Then addressing himself to Teedyuscung, he said, the nine men killed at Goshan, of which he had justly com∣plained, were not in his pro∣vince; the three belts he would make enquiry about of the governor of New York, and would send him an ans∣wer.

<P>This treaty with the Indians, who had been de∣bauched from the interest of Great Britain, auspici∣ously
<PB N="170" REF="1710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> paved the way for those operations which had been projected against the French settlements in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan of the cam∣paign on that con∣tinent.</NOTE> Canada. Instead of employing the whole strength of the British arms in North America against one object, the ministry proposed to divide the forces, and make impressions on three different parts at once, that the enemy might be divided, distracted, and weakened, and the conquest of Canada com∣pleated in one campaign. That the success might be the more certain, the different expeditions were planned in such a manner as to co-operate with each other, and even join occasionally; so practi∣cable was it thought for them to maintain such a correspondence as would admit of a junction of this nature. The project of this campaign imported, that general Wolfe, who had distinguished him∣self so eminently in the siege of Louisbourg, should proceed up the river St. Laurence, as soon as the navigation should be clear of ice, with a body of eight thousand men, and a considerable squadron of ships from England, to undertake the siege of Quebec, the capital of Canada: that general Am∣herst, who commanded in chief, should, with an∣other army of regular troops and provincials, amounting to twelve thousand men, reduce Ticon∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oga and Crown point, cross the lake Cham∣plain, and, proceeding along the river Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>helieu to the banks of St. Laurence, join general Wolfe in the siege of Quebec; that brigadier-general Pri∣deaux, with a third body, reinforced by a consi∣derable number of friendly Indians, assembled by the influence and under the command of Sir Wil∣liam Johnson, should invest the French fort, erect∣ed by the fall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cataract of Niagara, which was
<PB N="171" REF="1720"/>
certainly the most important post of all French<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> America, as it in a manner commands all the in∣terior patts of that vast continent. It overawes the whole country of the Six Nations, who were cajoled into a tame acquiescence in its being built on their territory: it secured all the inland trade, the navigation of the great lakes, the communica∣tion between Canada and Louisiana, and opened a passage for inroads into the colonies of Great-Bri∣tain. It was proposed, that the British forces, having reduced Niagara, might be embarked on the lake Ontario, fall down the river St. Laurence, besiege and take Montreal, and then join or co-operate with Amherst's army. Besides these larger armaments, colonel Stanwix commanded a smaller detachment for reducing smaller forts, and scour∣ing the banks of the lake Ontario.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Animad∣versions on that plan.</NOTE> How far this project was sounded on reason and military knowledge, may be judged by the follow∣ing particulars, of which the projectors were not ignorant. The navigation of the river St. Lau∣rence is dangerous and uncertain. The city of Que∣bec was remarkably strong, from situation and fortification, from the bravery of the inhabitants, and the number of the garrison. Monsieur de Montcalm, an officer of great courage and activity, kept the field between Montreal and Quebec with a body of ten thousand men, consisting of regular troops and disciplined militia, reinforced by a considerable number of armed Indians; and an∣other body of reserve hovered in the neighbour∣hood of Montreal, which was the residence of mon∣sieur de Vaudreuil, governor-general of Canada. The garrison of Niagara consisted of above six
<PB N="172" REF="1730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> hundred men; the march to it was tedious and embarrassed; and monsieur de Levi scoured the country with a flying detachment, well acquainted with all the woods and passes. With respect to ge∣neral Amherst's share of the plan, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts of Ticon∣deroga and Crown▪point stood in his way. The enemy were masters of the lake Champlain, and possessed the strong fort of Chambly, by the fall of the river Richelieu, which defended the pass to the river St. Laurence. Even had these obstacles been removed, it was hardly possible that he and Mr. Wolfe should arrive at Quebec in the same instant of time. The first that reached it, far from being in a condition to undertake the siege of Quebec, would run the risque of being engaged and de∣feated by the covering army: in which case, the other body must have been exposed to the most imminent hazard of destruction, in the midst of an enemy's country, far distant from any place of safety to which it could retreat. Had these disas∣ters happened, and, according to the experience of war, they were the natural consequences of the scheme, the troops at Niagara would in all pro∣bability have fallen an easy sacrifice, unless they had been so fortunate as to receive intelligence time enough to accomplish their retreat before they could be intercepted. The design would, we ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehend, have been more justifiable, or at least not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o liable to objection, had Mr. Amherst left two or three regiments to protect the frontiers of New York, and joining Mr. Wolfe with the rest, sailed up the river St. Laurence to besiege Quebec. Even in that case, the whole number of his troops would not have been su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ient, according to the
<PB N="173" REF="1740"/>
articles of war, to invest the place, and cope with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the covering army. Nevertheless, had the enter∣prize succeeded, Montcalm must either have hazarded an engagement against great odds, or retired farther into the country: then the route would have been open by land and water to Mont∣real, which could have made little resistance. The two principal towns being taken, and the naviga∣tion of St. Laurence blocked up, all the dependant forts must have surrendered at discretion, except Niagara, which there was a bare possibility of sup∣plying, at an incredible trouble and expence, from the distant Mississippi; but, even then, it might have been besieged in form, and easily reduced. Whatever defects there might have been in the plan, the execution, though it miscarried in some essential points, was attended with surprising suc∣cess.</P>
<P>The same good fortune that prospered the Bri∣tish arms so remarkably in the conquest of Guada∣lupe, seemed to interpose still more astonishingly in their favour at Quebec, the siege of which we shall record in its proper place: at present we must attend the operations of general Amherst, whose separate army was first in motion, though such im∣pediments were thrown in his way as greatly re∣tarded the progress of his operations; impedi∣ments said to have arisen from the pride, insolence, and obstinacy of certain individuals, who possessed great influence in that part of the world, and em∣ployed it all to thwart the service of their country.</P>
<P>The summer was already far advanced before general Amherst could pass lake George with his

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> forces, although they met with no opposition, and reach the neighbourhood of Ticonderoga, where, in the preceding year, the British troops had sus∣tained<NOTE PLACE="marg">The forts of Ticon∣deroga and Crown-point a∣bandoned by the enemy.</NOTE> such a terrible disaster. At first the enemy seemed determined to defend this fortress; but per∣ceiving the English commander resolute, cautious, and well prepared for undertaking the siege, hav∣ing moreover orders to retreat from place to place, towards the centre of operations at Quebec, rather than run the least risk of being made prisoners of war, they in the night of July the twenty-seventh abandoned the post, after having in some measure dismantled the fortifications, and retired to Crown-point, a fort situated on the verge of Lake Cham∣plain. General Amherst, having taken possession of this important post, which effectually covered the frontiers of New York, and secured to himself a safe retreat in case of necessity, ordered the works to be repaired, and allotted a strong garrison for its defence. This acquisition, however, was not made without the loss of a brave accomplished young of∣ficer colonel Roger Townshend, who, in reconnoi∣tring the fort, was killed with a cannon shot, and fell near the same spot which in the former year had been enriched with the blood of the gallant lord Howe, whom he strongly resembled in the circumstances of birth, age, qualifications, and cha∣racter. While the general superintended the re∣pairs of Ticonderoga, and the men were employed in preparing batteaus and other vessels, his scouting parties hovered in the neighbourhood of Crown-point, in order to watch the motion of the enemy. From one of these detachments, he received in∣telligence on the first day of August, that the
<PB N="175" REF="1760"/>
enemy had retired from Crown-point. He imme∣diately<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> detached a body of rangers before him to take possession of the place, embarked with the rest of the army, and on the fourth day of the month, landed at the fort, where the troops were immediately encamped. His next care was to lay the foundations of a new fort, to be maintained for the farther security of the British dominions in that part of the country, and particularly for preventing the inroads of scalping parties, by whom the planta∣tions had been dreadfully infested.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General Amherst embarks on the lake Cham∣plain.</NOTE> Here information was received that the enemy had retired to the isle Aux Noix, at the other end of the lake Champlain, five leagues on the hither side of St. John's; that their force encamped in that place, under the command of Mr. de Burle∣maque, consisted of three battalions and five pi∣quets of regular troops, with Canadians and ma∣rines, amounting in the whole to three thousand five hundred effective men, provided with nu∣merous artillery; and that the lake was occupied by four large vessels mounted with cannon, and manned with piquets of different regiments, under the command and direction of Mr. le Bras, a cap∣tain in the French navy, assisted by Mr. de Rigal, and other sea-officers. In consequence of this inti∣mation, general Amherst, who had for some time employed captain Loring to superintend the build∣ing of vessels at Ticonderoga, being resolved to have the superiority on the lake, directed the cap∣tain to build with all possible expedition a sloop of sixteen guns, and a radeau eighty▪four feet in length, capable of carrying six large cannon. These, together with a brigantine, being finished,
<PB N="176" REF="1770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> victualled, and manned by the eleventh day of Oc∣tober, the general embarked with the whole troops in batteaus, in order to attack the enemy; but next day, the weather growing tempestuous, was obliged to take shelter in a bay on the western shore, where the men were landed for refreshment. In the mean time, capt. Loring with his small squa∣dron sailed down the lake, gave chace to a French schooner, and drove three of their ships into a bay, where two of them were sunk, and the third run a▪ground by their own crews, who escaped: one, however, was repaired and brought away by capt. Loring, so that now the French had but one schooner remaining. General Amherst, after hav∣ing been some days wind-bound, reimbarked his forces, and proceeded down the lake; but the storm, which had abated, beginning to blow with redoubled fury, so as to swell the waves mountain high, the season for action being elapsed, and winter setting in with the most rigorous severity, he saw the impossibility of accomplishing his de∣sign, and was obliged to desist.</P>
<P>Returning to the same bay where he had been sheltered, he landed the troops, and began his march for Crown-point, where he arrived on the twenty-first day of October. Having secured a superiority on the lake, he now employed all his attention in rearing the new fortress at Crown-point, together with three small out-forts for its better defence; in opening roads of communica∣tion with Ticonderoga, and the governments of the Massachusets, and New Hampshire; and in mak∣ing dispositions for the winter-quarters of his troops, so as to protect the country from the in∣roads

of the enemy. During this whole summer<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> he received not the least intelligence of Mr. Wolfe's operations, except a few hints in some let∣ters relating to the exchange of prisoners, that came from the French general Montcalm, who gave him to understand, that Mr. Wolfe had landed in the neighbourhood of Quebec, and seemed de∣termined to undertake the siege of that city: that he had honoured him (the French general) with several notes, sometimes couched in a soothing strain, sometimes filled with threats <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quelquefois pleins de douceurs, quelquefois remplies de menaces.</NOTE>; that the French army intended to give him battle, and a few days would determine the fate of Quebec.</P>
<P>Though Mr. Amherst was ignorant of the pro∣ceedings of the Quebec squadron, his communica∣tion continued open with the forces which under∣took the siege of Niagara; and he received an ac∣count of their success before he had quitted the lines of Ticonderoga.</P>
<P>General Prideaux, with his body of troops, re∣inforced by the Indian auxiliaries under Sir Wil∣liam Johnson, advanced to the cataract of Niagara, without being exposed to the least inconvenience on his march; and investing the French fortress about the middle of July, carried on his approaches with great vigour, till the twentieth day of that month, when, visiting the trenches, he was unfor∣tunately slain by the burst ing of a cohorn. Mr. Amherst was no sooner inf ormed of his disaster, than he detached from Ticonderoga brigadier-general Gage, to assume the command of that army. In the mean time it devolved to Sir Wil∣liam
<PB N="178" REF="1800"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Johnson, who happily prosecuted the plan of his predecessor with all the success that could have<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reduction of Niaga∣ra.</NOTE> been desired. The enemy, alarmed with the ap∣prehension of losing a place of such importance, resolved to exert their<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endeavours for its relief. They assembled a body of regular troops, amount∣ing to twelve hundred men, drawn from Detroit, Venango, and Presque Isle; and these, with a number of Indian auxiliaries, were detached, under the command of monsieur d'Aubry, on an attempt to reinforce the garrison of Niagara. Sir William Johnson, having received intelligence of their de∣sign, made a disposition to intercept them in their march. In the evening he ordered the light in∣fantry and piquets to post themselves to the left, on the road leading from Niagara falls to the for∣tress; and these were reinforced in the morning with the grenadiers, and part of the forty-sixth re∣giment, commanded by lieutenant▪colonel Massey▪ and another regiment, under lieutenant colone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quhar, was posted at the tail of the works, in order to support the guard of the trenches. About eight in the morning, the enemy being in sight, the Indians in the English army advanced to speak with their countrymen, who served under the French banners; but this conference was declined by the enemy. Then the French Indians having uttered the horrible scream called the war-whoop, which by this time had lost its effect among the British forces, the enemy began the action with great impetuosity: but they met with such a hot reception in front, while the Indian auxiliaries fell upon their flanks, that in little more than half an hour their whole army was routed, their general▪
<PB N="179" REF="1810"/>
with all his officers taken, and the pursuit conti∣nued<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> through the woods for several miles with con∣siderable slaughter. This battle, which happened on the twenty-fourth day of July, having been fought in sight of the French garrison at Niagara, Sir William Johnson sent major Harvey with a trumpet to the commanding officer, to present him with a list of the seventeen officers taken in the en∣gagement, and exhort him to surrender before more blood was shed, while he had it in his power to restrain the Indians. The commandant, having certified himself of the truth, by sending an officer to visit the prisoners, agreed to treat, and in a few hours the capitulation was ratified. The garrison, consisting of six hundred and seven effective men, marched out with the honours of war, in order to be embarked in vessels on the lake, and conveyed in the most expeditious manner to New York. They laid down their arms when they embarked; but were permitted to keep their baggage, and, by a proper escorte, protected from the savage inso∣lence and rapacity of the Indians. All the women were conducted, at their own request, to Mont∣real; and the sick and wounded, who could not bear the fatigue of travelling, were treated with hu∣manity.</P>
<P>This was the second compleat victory obtained on the continent of North America, in the course of the same war, by Sir William Johnson, who, without the help of a military education, succeeded so signally in the field by ding of innate courage and natural sagacity. What remarkably characte∣rises these battles, is the circumstance of his having taken in both the commander of the enemy. In∣deed,
<PB N="180" REF="1820"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the war in general may be distinguished by the singular success of this gentleman and the cele∣brated Mr. Clive, two self-taught generals; who, by a series of shining actions, have demonstrated, that uninstructed genius can, by its own internal light and efficacy, rival, if not eclipse, the acquired art of discipline and experience. Sir William John∣son was not more serviceable to his country by his valour and conduct in the field, than by the influence and authority which his justice, benevolence, and integrity had acquired among the Indian tribes of the Six Nations, whom he not only assembled at Niagara, to the number of eleven hundred, but also restrained within the bounds of good order and moderation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc∣tion to the expedi∣tion against Quebec.</NOTE> The reduction of Niagara, and the possession of Crown-point, were exploits much more easily at∣chieved than the conquest of Quebec, the great object to which all these operations were subordi∣nate. Of that we row come to give the detail, fraught with singular adventures and surprising events; in the course of which a noble spirit of enterprize was displayed, and the scenes of war were exhibited in all the variety of desolation. It was about the middle of February that a consi∣derable squadron sailed from England for Cape Breton, under the command of the admirals Saun∣ders and Holmes, two gentlemen of worth and probity, who had on several occasions signalized their courage and conduct in the service of their country. By the twenty-first day of April they were in sight of Louisbourg; but the harbour was blocked up with ice in such a manner, that they were obliged to bear away for Halifax in Nova-Scotia.
<PB REF="1830"/>

<PB N="181" REF="1840"/>
From hence rear admiral Durell was de∣tached<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> with a small squadron, to sail up the river St. Laurence as far as the isle de Coudres, in order to intercept any supplies from France intended for Quebec: he accordingly took two storeships▪ but he was anticipated by seventeen sail of ships, loaded with provision, stores, and some recruits, under convoy of three frigates, which had already reached the capital of Canada. Mean while, admiral Saun∣ders arrived at Louisbourg; and the troops being embarked, to the number of eight thousand, pro∣ceeded up the river without further delay. The operations at land were intrusted to the conduct of major-general James Wolfe, whose talents had shone with such superior lustre at the siege of Louisbourg; and his subordinates in command were the brigadiers Monckton, Townshend, and Murray; all four in the flower of their age, who had studied the military art with equal eagerness and proficiency, and, though young in years, were old in experience. The first was a soldier by descent, the son of major-general Wolfe, a veteran officer of acknowledged capacity: the other three resembled each other, not only in years, qualifica∣tions, and station, but also in family-rank, all three being the sons of noblemen. The situation of brigadier Townshend was singular: he had served abroad in the last war with reputation, and resigned his commission during the peace, in disdain of some hard usage he had sustained from his superiors. That his military talents, however, might not be lost to his country, he exercised them with equal spirit and perseverance in projecting and promot∣ing the plan of a national militia. When the
<PB N="182" REF="1850"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> command and direction of the army devolved to a new leader, so predominant in his breast was the spirit of patriotism and the love of glory, that tho' heir apparent to a British peerage, possessed of a very affluent fortune, remarkably dear to his ac∣quaintance, and solicited to a life of quiet by every allurement of domestic felicity, he waved these considerations: he burst from all intanglements; proffered his service to his sovereign; exposed him∣self to the perils of a disagreeable voyage, the ri∣gours of a severe climate, and the hazards of a cam∣paign peculiarly fraught with toil, danger, and difficulty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General Wolfe lands on the island of Or∣leans.</NOTE> The armament intended for Quebec sailed up the river St. Laurence, without having met with any interruption, or having perceived any of those difficulties and perils with which it had been re∣ported that the navigation of it was attended. Their good fortune in this particular, indeed, was owing to some excellent charts of the river, which had been found in vessels taken from the enemy. About the latter end of June the land-forces were disembarked in two divisions upon the isle of Or∣leans, situated a little below Quebec, a large fertile island, well cultivated, producing plenty of grain, abounding with people, villages, and plantations. General Wolfe no sooner landed on the island of Orleans than he distributed a manifesto among the French colonists, importing, That the king his master, justly exasperated against the French mo∣narch, had equipped a considerable armament, in order to humble his pride, and was determined to reduce the most considerable French settlements in America.

He observed, that the English were masters of the river St. Laurence, so as to intercept all succours from Europe; and had, besides, a powerful army on the continent, under the command of general Amherst. He affirmed, That the resolution they ought to take was neither difficult nor doubtful, as the utmost exertion of their valour would be use∣less, and serve only to deprive them of the ad∣vantages which they might reap from their neutra∣lity. He reminded them, that the cruelties exer∣cised by the French upon the subjects of Great Bri∣tain in America, would excuse the most severe re∣prisals; but Britons were too generous to follow such barbarous examples. He again offered to the Canadians the sweets of peace, amidst the hor∣rors of war; and left it to themselves to determine their own fate by their own conduct. He ex∣pressed his hope, that the world would do him justice, should they oblige him, by rejecting these favourable terms, to adopt violent measures. He expatiated upon the strength and power, as well as the generosity of Great Britain, in thus stretching out the hand of humanity; a hand ready to assist them on all occasions, even when France was, by her weakness, compelled to abandon them in the

This declaration pro∣duced no immediate effect; nor, indeed, did the Canadians depend upon the sincerity and promised faith of a nation, whom their priests had industri∣ously represented as the most savage and cruel ene∣my on earth. Possessed of those notions, which prevailed even among the better sort, they chose to abandon their habitations, and expose them∣selves and families to certain ruin, in provoking the English by the most cruel hostilities, rather than be quiet, and confide in the general's promise of protection. Instead of pursuing this prudent plan of conduct, they joined the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The operation of scalp∣ing, which, to the shame of both nations, is encouraged both by French and English, the savages perform in this manner.—The hapless victim being disabled, or disarmed, the Indian, with a sharp knife, provided and worn for the purpose, makes a circular in∣cision to the bone, round the upper part of the head, and tears off the scalp with his fingers.

In all probability the French general's authority was not sufficient to bridle the ferocity of the sa∣vages, who continued to scalp and murder with the most brutal appetite for blood and revenge; so that Mr. Wolfe, in order to intimidate the enemy into a cessation of these outrages, sound it neces∣sary to connive at some irregularities in the way of retaliation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes possession of Point Levi.</NOTE> Mr. de Montcalm, who commanded the French troops, though superior in number to the invaders, very wisely resolved to depend upon the natural strength of the country, which appeared almost in∣surmountable, and had carefully taken all his pre∣cautions of defence. The city of Quebec was skilfully fortified, secured with a numerous garri∣son, and plentifully supplied with provision and am∣munition. Montcalm had reinforced the troops of the colony with five regular battalions, formed of the best of the inhabitants, completely disciplined all the Canadians of the neighbourhood capable of bearing arms, and several tribes of savages. With this army he had taken the field, in a very advan∣tageous situation, encamped along the shore of Beau∣fort, from the river St. Charles to the falls of Montmorenci, every accessible part being deeply intrenched. To undertake the siege of Quebec
<PB N="186" REF="1890"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> against such odds and advantages, was not only a deviation from the established maxims of war, but a rash enterprize, seemingly urged in diametrical op∣position to the dictates of common sense. Mr. Wolfe was well acquainted with all the difficulties of the undertaking; but he knew at the same time he should always have it in his power to retreat, in case of emergency, while the British squadron maintained its station in the river: he was not with∣out hope of being joined by general Amherst; and he was stimulated by an appetite for glory, which the prospect of accumulated dangers could not allay. Understanding that there was a body of the enemy posted, with cannon, at the Point of Levi, on the south shore, opposite to the city of Quebec, he detached against them brigadier Monckton, at the head of four battalions, who passed the river at night; and next morning, having skirmished with some of the enemy's irregulars, obliged them to retire from that post, which the English immediately occupied. At the same time colonel Carlton, with another detachment, took possession of the western point of the island of Orleans; and both these posts were fortified, in order to anticipate the enemy, who, had they kept possession of either, might have rendered it impos∣sible for any ship to lie at anchor within ▪two miles of Quebec. Besides, the Point of Levi was within cannon-shot of the city, against which a battery of mortars and artillery was immediately erected. Montcalm, foreseeing the effect of this expedient, detached a body of sixteen hundred men across the river, to attack and destroy the works before they were completed: but this detachment fell into dis∣order,
<PB N="187" REF="1900"/>
fired upon each other, and retired in confu∣sion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> The battery being finished, without further interruption, the cannon and mortars began to play with such success, that in a little time the upper town was considerably damaged, and the lower town reduced to a heap of rubbish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fleet endan∣gered by a storm.</NOTE> In the mean time the fleet was exposed to the most imminent danger. Immediately after the troops had been landed on the island of Orleans, the wind increased to a furious storm, which blew with such violence, that many transports ran foul of one another, and were disabled; a number of boats and small craft foundered, and divers large ships lost their anchors. The enemy resolving to take advantage of the confusion which they imagined this disaster must have produced, prepared seven fireships, and at midnight sent them down from Quebec among the transports, which lay so thick as to cover the whole surface of the river. The scheme, though well contrived, and seasonably exe∣cuted, was entirely defeated by the deliberation of the British admiral, and the dexterity of his ma∣riners, who resolutely boarded the fireships, and towed them fast a-ground, where they lay burning to the water's edge, without having done the least prejudice to the English squadron. On the very same day of the succeeding month, they sent down a raft of fireships, or radeaus, which were likewise consumed, without producing any effect.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> which divided them from the left of the enemy; and next morning a company of rangers, posted in a wood to cover some workmen, were attacked by the French Indians, and totally defeated: however, the nearest troops advancing, repulsed the Indians in their turn with considerable loss. The reasons that induced general Wolfe to choose this situa∣tion by the falls of Montmorenci, in which he was divided from Quebec by this, and another river called St. Charles, he explained in a letter to the secretary of state. He observed that the ground which he had chosen was high, and in some mea∣sure commanded the opposite side on which the enemy was posted: that there was a ford below the falls, passable in every tide for some hours at the latter part of the ebb, and beginning of the flood; and he hoped that means might be found of passing the river higher up, so as to fight the mar∣quis de Montcalm upon less disadvantageous terms than those of directly attacking his intrenchments. Accordingly, in reconnoitring the river Montmo∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nci, a ford was discovered about three miles above; but the opposite bank, which was naturally sleep and covered with woods, the enemy had in∣trenched in such a manner as to render it almost in∣accessible. The escorte was twice attacked by the Indians, who were as often repulsed; but these rencounters cost the English about forty men killed and wounded, including some officers.</P>
<P>Some shrewd objections might be started to the general's choice of ground on this occasion. He could not act at all without passing the river Mont∣morenci at a very great disadvantage, and attack∣ing an enemy superior to himself in number, se∣cured

Had he<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> even, by dint of extraordinary valour driven them from these strong posts, the success must have cost him a great number of officers and men; and the enemy might have retreated behind the river St. Charles, which he must also have passed under the same disadvantages, before he could begin his operations against the city of Quebec. Had his good fortune enabled him to surmount all these difficulties, and after all to defeat the enemy in a pitched battle, the garrison of Quebec might have been reinforced by the wreck of their army; and he could not, with any probability of success, have undertaken the siege of an extensive fortified place, which he had not troops sufficient to invest, and whose garrison would have been nearly equal in number to the sum total of the troops he com∣manded. At any rate, the chance of a fair engage∣ment in the open field was what he had little reason to expect in that situation, from the known expe∣rience, and the apparent conduct of the French ge∣neral. These objections appeared so obvious and important, that general Wolfe would not deter∣mine to risque an attack, until he had surveyed the upper part of the river St. Laurence, in hope of finding some place more favourable for a descent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He fails up the river with a detach∣ment.</NOTE> On the eighteenth day of July, the admiral, at his request, sent two ships of war, two armed sloops, and some transports, having troops on board, up the river; and they passed the city of Quebec, with∣out having sustained any damage. The general, being on board of this little armament, carefully observed the banks on the side of the enemy, which were extremely difficult from the nature of the
<PB N="190" REF="1930"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> ground, and these difficulties were redoubled by the foresight and precaution of the French com∣mander. Though a descent seemed impracticable between the city and Cape Rouge, where it was intended, general Wolfe, in order to divide the enemy's force, and procure intelligence, ordered a detachment, under the command of colonel Carlton, to land higher up at the Point Au Trem∣ble, to which place he was informed, a good num∣ber of the inhabitants of Quebec had retired with their most valuable effects. This service was per∣formed with little loss, and some prisoners were brought away; but no magazine was discovered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He at∣tacks the French intrench∣ment at Montmo∣renci, and is repul∣sed with consider∣able loss.</NOTE> The general, thus disappointed in his expecta∣tion, returned to Montmorenci, where brigadier Townshend had, by maintaining a superior fire across that river, prevented the enemy from erect∣ing a battery, which would have commanded the English camp; and now he resolved to attack them, though posted to great advantage, and every where prepared to give him a warm recep∣tion. His design was, first to reduce a detached redoubt close to the water's edge; seemingly situ∣ated without gun-shot of the intrenchment on the hill. Should this fortification be supported by the enemy, he foresaw that he should be able to bring on a general engagement: on the con∣trary, should they remain tame spectators of its reduction, he could afterwards examine ther situ∣ation at leisure, and determine the place at which they could be most easily attacked. Preparations were accordingly made for storming the redoubt. On the last day of July, in the forenoon, part of brigadier Monckton's brigade was embarked in the
<PB N="191" REF="1940"/>
boats of the fleet, to be transported from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Point of Levi. The two brigades commanded by the brigadiers Townshend and Murray were drawn out in order to pass the ford, when it should be necessary. To facilitate their passage, the admiral had stationed the Centurion ship of war in the channel, to check the fire of the lower battery, by which the ford was commanded: a numerous train of artillery was placed upon the eminence, to batter and enfilade the left of the enemy's intrenchment; and two flat-bottomed armed vessels, prepared for the purpose, were run a∣ground near the redoubt, to favour the descent of the forces. The manifest confusion produced among the French by these previous measures, and by the fire of the Centurion, which was well directed and sustained, determined Mr. Wolfe to storm this intrenchment without further delay. Orders were issued, that the three brigadiers should put their troops in motion at a certain signal, which was accordingly made at a proper time of the tide. Many of the boats from Point Levi, ran aground upon a ledge, that runs off a considerable distance from the shore; and this accident occasioned a dis∣order, by which so much time was lost, that the general was obliged to stop the march of briga∣dier Townshend's corps, which he perceived to be in motion. In the mean time, the boats were floated, and ranged in proper order, though ex∣posed to a severe fire of shot and shells; and the general in person sounding the shore, pointed out the place where the troops might disembark with the least difficulty. Thirteen companies of grena∣diers, and two hundred men of the second Ame∣rican
<PB N="192" REF="1950"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> battalion, were the first who landed. They had received orders to form in four distinct bodies, and begin the attack, supported by the corps of bri∣gadier Monckton, as soon as the other troops should have passed the ford,' and be near enough to con∣tribute their assistance. These instructions, how∣ever, were intirely neglected. Before Mr. Monck∣ton had landed, and while brigadier Townshend was on his march at a considerable distance, the grenadiers, without waiting to be drawn up in any regular form, impetuously rushed towards the ene∣my's intrenchments in the utmost disorder. Their courage served only to increase their misfortune. The first fire they received did such execution among them, that they were obliged to shelter themselves under the redoubt which the French had abandoned at their approach. In this uncom∣fortable situation they remained some time, unable to form under so hot a fire, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of many gallant officers, who la∣vishly exposed, and even lost their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives in the ho∣nourable discharge of their duty <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The following anecdote is so remarkable, and tends so much to the honour of the British soldiery, that we insert it without fear of the rea∣der's disapprobation. Capt. Ochterlony and ensign Pey∣ton belonged to the regiment of brigadier general Monck∣ton. They were nearly of an age, which did not exceed thirty: the first was a North Briton, the other a native of Ireland. Both were agreeable in person, and unblemished in character, and connected together by the ties of mutual friendship and esteem. On the day that preceded the battle, capt. Ochterlony ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been obliged to fight a duel with a German officer; in which, though he wounded and disarmed his antagonist, yet he himself received a dan∣gerous hurt under the right arm; in consequence of which his friends insisted on his re∣maining in camp during the action of next day; but his spirit was too great to com∣ply with this remonstrance. He declared it should never be said that a seratch, receiv∣ed in a private rencounter, had prevented him from do∣ing his duty, when his coun∣try required his service; and he took the field with a fusil in his hand, though he was hardly able to carry his arms. In leading up his men to the enemy's entrenchment, he was shot through the lungs with a musket-ball; an acci∣dent which obliged him to part with his fusil: but he still continued advancing, un∣til, by loss of blood, he be∣came too weak to proceed further. About the same time Mr. Peyton was lamed by a shot which shattered the small bone of his left leg. The soldiers, in their retreat, earnestly begged, with tears in their eyes, that capt. Och∣terlony would allow them to carry him and the ensign off the field. But he was so biggoted to a severe point of honour, that he would not quit the ground, though he desired they would take care of his ensign. Mr. Peyton, with a generous disdain, re∣jected their good offices, de∣claring that he would not leave his captain in such a situation; and in a little time they remained the sole sur∣vivors on that part of the field.</P>
<P>Capt. Ochterlony sat down by his friend, and, as they expected nothing but imme∣diate death, they took leave of each other: yet they were not altogether abandoned by the hope of being protected as prisoners: for the captain seeing a French soldier with two Indians approach, started up, and accosting them in the French language, which he spoke perfectly well, express∣ed his expectation that they would treat him and his com∣panion as officers, prisoners, and gentlemen. The two Indians seemed to be intire∣ly under the conduct of the Frenchman, who coming up to Mr. Peyton, as he sat on the ground, snatched his laced hat from his head, and robbed the captain of his watch and money. This outrage was a signal to the Indians for mur∣der and pillage. One of them, clubbing his firelock, struck at him behind, with a view to knock him down; but the blow missing his head, took place upon his shoulder. At the same in∣stant the other Indian poured his shot into the breast of this unfertunate young gentle∣man, who cried out, <Q>“O Peyton <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the villian has shot me.”</Q> Not yet satisfied with cruelty, the barbarian sprung upon him▪ and stabb∣ed him in the belly with his scalping knife. The captain, having parted with his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usil, had no weapon for his de∣fence, as none of the officers wore swords in the action. The three ruffians▪ finding him still alive, endeavoured to strangle him with his own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asn; and he was now upon his knees, struggling against them with surprising exertion. Mr. Peyton, at this juncture, having a double barrelled musket in his hand, and see∣ing the distress of his friend, fired at one of the Indians, who dropped dead upon the spot. The other thinking the ensign would now be an easy prey, advanced towards him; and Mr. Peyton, having taken good aim at the distance of four yards, discharged his piece the second time; but it seemed to take no effect. The savage fired in his turn, and wounded the ensign in the shoulder; then rushing upon him, thrust his bayonet through his body. He re∣peated the blow, which Mr. Peyton attempting to parry, received another wound in his left hand. Nevertheless, he seized the Indian's musket with the same hand, pulling him forwards, and with his right drawing a dagger which hung by his side, plunged it in the barbarian's side. A violent struggle ensued: but at length Mr. Peyton was up∣permost, and, with repeated strokes of his dagger, killed his antagonist outright. Here he was seized with an unac∣countable emotion of cutio∣sity, to know whether or not his shot had taken place on the body of the Indian; he accordingly turned him up, and, stripping off his blanket, perceived that the ball had penetrated quite through the cavity of the breast. Having thus obtained a dear-bought victory, he started up on one leg, and saw capt. Ochterlony standing at the distance of sixty yards, close by the e∣nemy's breastwork, with the French soldier attending him. Mr. Peyton then called aloud, "Capt. Ochterlony, I am glad to see you have at last got un∣der protection. Beware of that villain, who is more barbarous than the savages. God bless you, my dear cap∣tain. I see a party of Indians coming this way, and expect to be murdered immediate∣ly." A number of those bar∣barians had for some time been employed on the left in scalping and pillaging the dy∣ing and the dead that were left upon the field of battle; and above thirty of these banditti were in full march to destroy Mr. Peyton. This gentleman knew he had no mercy to ex∣pect; for, should his life be spared for the present, they would have afterwards insist∣ed upon sacrificing him to the manes of their brethren whom he had siain; and, in that case, he would have been put to death by the most ex∣cruciating tortures. Full of this idea, he snatched up his musket, and▪ notwithstand∣ing his broken leg, can above forty yards without hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing: seeling himself now totally disabled, and incapable of proceeding one step farther, he loaded his piece, and pre∣sented it to the two foremost Indians, who stood aloof, waiting to be joined by their fellows: while the French, from their breastwork, kept up a continual fare of cannon and small arms upon this poor solitary, maimed gen∣tleman. In this uncomforta∣ble situation he stood, when he discerned at a distance an highland officer, with a party of his men, skirting the plan towards the field of battle. He forthwith waved his hand in signal of distress, and be∣ing perceived by the officer, he detached three of his men to his assistance. These brave fellows hastened to him thro' the midst of a terrible fire, and one of them bore him
off on his shoulders. The Highland officer was capt. Macdonald, of col. Frazier's battalion; who understand∣ing that a young gentleman, his kinsman, had dropped on the field of battle, put him∣self at the head of his party, with which he penetrated to the middle of the field, drove a considerable number of French and Indians before him, and finding his relation still unscalped, carried him off in triumph. Poer capt. Ochterlony was conveyed to Quebec, where in a few days he died of his wounds; and after the reduction of that place, the French surgeons who attended him declared, that, in all probabillity, he would have recovered of the two shots he had received in his breast, had not he been mortally wounded in the belly by the Indian's scalping knife.</P>
<P>As this very remarkable scene was acted in sight of both armies, General T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd, in the sequel, expostulated with the French officers upon the inhumanity of keeping up such a severe fire against two wounded gentlemen, who were disabled and destitute of all hope of escaping. They answered, that the fire was not made by the regulars, but by the Canadians and Savages, whom it was not in the power of discipline to restrain.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="177" REF="1960"/>
seeing all their endeavours abortive, ordered them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to retreat and form behind Monckton's brigade,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> which was, by this time, landed and drawn up on the beach in good order. They accordingly

<PB N="180" REF="1990"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> savages, who massacred the living, and scalped the dead, even in sight of their indignant companions. This unhappy accident occasioned a new delay, and the day was already far advanced. The wind be∣gan to blow with uncommon violence, and the tide to make; so that, in case of a second repulse, the retreat of brigadier Townshend might have been rendered hazardous and uncertain: Mr. Wolfe therefore thought proper to desist, and returned without further molestation to the other side of the river Montmorenci. The admiral ordered the two vessels which were a ground, to be set on fire, that they might not fall into the hands of the enemy. The advantages that favoured an attack in this part consisted of the following particulars. All the artillery could be used with good effect; all the troops could act at once; and, in case of a mis∣carriage, the retreat was secure and open, at least, for a certain time of the tide. These, however, seemed to be over-ballanced by other considerations. The enemy were posted on a commanding emi∣nence; the beach was covered with deep mud, slip∣pery, and broken into holes and gullies: the hill was steep, and in some places impracticable; the enemy
<PB N="181" REF="2000"/>
were numerous, and poured in a very severe fire<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> from their intrenchments. Had the attack succeeded the loss of the English must have been very heavy, and that of the French inconsiderable; because the neighbouring woods afforded them immediate shelter: finally, the river St. Charles still remained to be passed, before the town could be invested.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brigadier Murray is detached up the river.</NOTE> Immediately after this mortifying check, in which above five hundred men, and many brave officers were lost, the general detached brigadier Murray, with twelve hundred men, in transports above the town, to co-operate with rear-admiral Holmes, whom the admiral had sent up with some force against the French shipping, which he hoped to de∣stroy. The brigadier was likewife instructed to seize every opportunity of fighting the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and even of provoking them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> In pursuance of these directions, he twice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to land on the north shore; but these attempts were unsuccessful: the third effort was more for∣tunate; he made a sudden descent at Chambaud, and burned a considerable magazine, filled with arms, cloathing, provision and ammunition. The enemy's ships being secured in such a manner, as not to be approached, and nothing else occuring that required the brigadier's longer stay, he returned to the camp, with intelligence obtained from his prisoners, that the fort of Niagara was taken, Crown Point abandoned, and general Amherst em∣ployed in making preparations to attack the corps commanded at the Isle aux Noix by Mr. Burle∣maque.</P>
<P>The disaster at the falls of Montmorenci made a deep impression on the mind of general Wolfe,
<PB N="182" REF="2010"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> whose spirit was too great to brook the most distant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the situation of gene∣ral Wolf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> prospect of censure or disgrace. He knew the cha∣racter of the English people, rash, impatient, and capricious; elevated to exultation by the least gleam of success, dejected even to despondency by the most inconsiderable frown of adverse fortune; sanguine even to childish hyperbole, in applaud¦ing those servants of the public who have prospered in their undertakings; clamorous to a degree of persecution against those who have miscarried in their endeavours; without any investigation of merit; without any consideration of circumstance. A keen sense of these vexatious peculiarities con∣spiring with the shame of disappointment, an ea∣ger desire of retrieving the laurel, that he might by some be supposed to have lost at the falls of Montmorenci, and the despair of finding such an occasion, excited an internal agitation, which visi∣bly affected his external frame, and disordered his whole constitution, which was naturally delicate and tender. Among those who shared his confi∣dence, he was often seen to sigh; he was often heard to complain; and even in the transports of his chagrin, declare, that he would never return without success, to be exposed, as other unfortu∣nate commanders had been, to the censure and reproach of an ignorant and ungrateful populace. This tumult of the mind, added to the fatigues of body he had undergone, produced a fever and dysentery; by which, for some time, he was to∣tally disabled.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> Before he recovered any degree of strength, he desired the general officers to consult together for the public utility; and it was their opinion, that

This measure how∣ever, was not adopted, until the general and ad∣miral had reconnoitred the town of Quebec, with a view to a general assault, and concluded from their own observation, reinforced by the opinion of the chief engineer, who was perfectly well acquainted with the interiors of the place, that such an attack could not be hazarded with any prospect of success. The ships of war, indeed, might have silenced the batteries of the lower town; but, they could not affect the upper-works, from which they must have sustained considerable damage.</P>
<P>When we consider the situation of this place, and the fortifications with which it was secured; the natural strength of the country; the great number of vessels and floating batteries they had provided for the defence of the river; the skill, valour, superior force, and uncommon vigilance of the enemy; their numerous bodies of savages con∣tinually hovering about the posts of the English, to surprize parties and harrass detachments; we must own that there was such a combination of dif∣ficulties, as might have discouraged and perplexed the most resolute and intelligent commander.</P>
<P>In consequence of the resolution taken to quit the camp at Montmorenci, the troops and artillery were reimbarked and landed at Point Levi: they afterwards passed up the river in transports, while admiral Holmes made a movement with his ships to amuse the enemy posted on the north-shor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759▪</NOTE> and the men being much crowded on board, the gene∣ral ordered one half of them to be landed for refresh∣ment on the other side of the river. As no possi∣bility appeared of annoying the enemy above the town, the scheme of operations was totally changed. The three brigadiers formed, and presented a plan for conveying the troops farther down in boats, and landing them in the night within a league of cape-Diamond, in hope of ascending the heights of Abraham, which rise abruptly, with a steep ascent from the banks of the river, that they might take possession of the ground on the back of the city, where it was but indifferently fortified. The dangers and difficulties attending the execution of this design were so peculiarly discouraging, that one would imagine it could not have been embra∣ced but by a spirit of enterprize that bordered on desparation. The stream was rapid; the shore s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elving; the bank of the river lined with centi∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; the landing place so narrow as to be easily missed in the dark; and the ground so difficult as hardly to be surmounted in the day-time, had no opposition been expected. If the enemy had re∣ceived the least intimation from spy or deserter, or even su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the scheme: had the embarka∣tion been disordered, in consequence of the dark∣ness of the night, the rapidity of the river, or the shelviness of the north▪shore, near which they were obliged to row: had one centinel been alarmed; or the landing place much mistaken; the heights of Abraham must have been instantly secured, by such a force as would have rendered the undertak∣ing ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtive: confusion would have necessarily en∣sued in the dark; and this would have naturally

produced a pannic, which might have proved fatal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to the greater part of the detachment. These ob∣jections could not escape the penetration of the gal∣lant Wolfe, who, nevertheless, adopted the plan without hesitation; and even executed it in per∣son; tho' at that time labouring under a severe dysentery and fever, which had exhausted his con∣stitution, and reduced him almost to an extremity of weakness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The troops land at the heights of Abra∣ham.</NOTE> The previous steps being taken, and the time fixed for this hazardous attempt, admiral Holmes moved with his squadron farther up the river, about three leagues above the place appointed for the disembarkation; that he might deceive the enemy, and amuse Mr. de Bougainville, whom Montcalm had detached with fifteen hundred men to watch the motions of that squa∣dron; but the English admiral was directed to sail down the river in the night, so as to protect the landing of the forces; and these orders he punctu∣ally fulfilled. On the twelfth day of September, an hour after midnight, the first embarkation, con∣sisting of four complete regiments, the light in∣fantry, commanded by colonel How, a detach∣ment of Highlanders, and the American grenadiers, was made in flat-bottomed boats, under the immediate command of the brigadiers Monckton and Murray; though general Wolfe accompanied them in person, and was among the first who land∣ed, and they began to fall down with the tide, to the intended place of disembarkation; rowing close to the north shore, in order to find it the more ea∣sily. Without any disorder the boats glided gently along; but, by the rapidity of the tide, and the
<PB N="186" REF="2060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> darkness of the night, the boa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s overshot the mark, and the troops landed a little below the place at which the disembarkation was intended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>How far the success of this attempt depended upon accident, may be conceived from the following particu∣lars.—In the twilight two French deserters were carried on board a ship of war, com∣manded by captain Smith and laying at anchor near the North shore. They told him, that the garrison of Quebec expected that night to receive a convoy of provisions, sent down the river in boats, from the detachment above, com∣manded by Mr. de Bougain∣ville. These deserters stand∣ing upon deck, and perceiv∣ing the English boats, with the troops, gliding down the river in the dark, began to shout, and make a noise; de∣claring they were part of the expected convoy. Captain Smith, who was ignorant of general Wolfe's design, be∣lieving their affirmation, had actually given orders to point the guns at the British troops; when the general perceiving a commo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on on board, rowed along side in person, and pre∣vented the discharge, which would have alarmed the town, and entirely frustrated the attempt.</P>
<P>The French had posted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to chal∣lenge boats and vessels, and give the alarm occasionally. The first boat that contained the English troops, being questioned accordingly, a captain of Fraser's regiment, who had served in Holland, and who was perfectly well acquainted with the French language and customs, an∣swered, without hesitation to <HI>Qui vit,</HI> which is their chal∣lenging word, <HI>la France:</HI> nor was he at a loss, to answer the second question, which was much more particular and difficult. When the sentinel demanded <HI>a quel regiment?</HI> to what regiment? the captain replied <HI>de la Reine,</HI> which he knew, by accident, to be one of those that composed the body commanded by Bou∣gainville. The soldier took it for granted, this was the expected convoy; and saying <HI>passe,</HI> allowed all the boats to proceed without further question. In the same man∣ner, the other sentries were deceived; tho' one more wa∣ry than the rest, came run∣ning down to the water's edge; and called, <HI>pourquoy est que vous ne parlez plus baut?</HI> <Q>“Why don't you speak with an audible voice▪”</Q> To this interrogation, which im∣plied doubt, the captain an∣swered with admirable pre∣sence of mind, in a soft tone of voice, <HI>Tai toi, nous serons entendues!</HI> <Q>“Hush! we shall be overheard and disco∣vered.”</Q> Thus cautioned, the sentry retired without farther altercation. The midshipman who piloted the first boat, passing by the landing-place in the dark, the same captain, who knew from his having been post∣ed formerly with his com∣pany on the other side of the river, insisted upon the pi∣lot's being mistaken, and commanded the rowers to put ashore in the proper place, or at least very near it.</P>
<P>When general Wolfe land∣ed, and saw the difficulty of ascending the precipice, he said to the same officer, in a familiar strain, <Q>“I don't be∣lieve there is any possibi∣lity of getting up; but you must do your endea∣vour.”</Q> The narrow path that slanted up the hill from the landing-place, the enemy had broken up and rendered impassable by cross ditches; beside the intrenchment at the top: in every other part the hill was so steep and dan∣gerous, that the soldiers were obliged to pull themselves up by the roots and boughs of trees, growing on both sides of the path▪</P></NOTE>. As the troops landed, the boats were sent back for

the second embarkation, which was superintended<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> by brigadier Townshend. In the mean time co∣lonel Howe, with the light infantry and the High∣landers, ascended the woody precipices with admi∣rable courage and activity; and dislodged a cap∣tain's guard, which defended a small intrenched narrow path, by which alone the rest of the forces could reach the summit. Then they mounted, without further molestation from the enemy, and the general drew them up in order, as they arrived. Monsieur de Montcalm no sooner understood that the English had gained the heights of Abra∣ham, which in a manner commanded the town on its weakest part, than he resolved to hazard a bat∣tle, and began his march without delay; after hav∣ing

<P>General Wolfe, perceiving the enemy crossing the river St. Charles, began to form his own line, which consisted of six battalions, and the Louis∣bourg grenadiers; the right commanded by bri∣gadier Monckton, and the left by brigadier Mur∣ray: to the rear of the left colonel Howe was posted with his light infantry, just returned from a four gun battery, which they had taken without opposition. Mr. de Montcalm, advancing in such a manner as to shew his intention was to flank the left of the English, brigadier Townshend was sent thither with the regiment of Amherst, which he formed <HI>en potence,</HI> presenting a double front to the enemy: he was afterwards reinforced by two bat∣talions; and the reserve consisted of one regiment drawn up in eight subdivisions, with large intervals. The right of the enemy was composed of half the colony troops, two battalions, and a body of Ca∣nadians and savages; their centre consisted of a column, formed by two other regular battalions; and on the left, one battalion, with the remainder of the colony troops, was posted: the bushes and corn-fields in their front were lined with fifteen hundred of their best marksmen, who kept up an irregular galling fire, which proved fatal to many brave officers, thus singled out for destruction. This fire, indeed, was in some measure checked by the advanced posts of the British line; who pi∣queered with the enemy for some hours before the battle began. Both armies were destitute of ar∣tillery, except two small pieces on the side of the French, and a single gun, which the English sea∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
<PB N="189" REF="2090"/>
had made shift to draw up from the landing∣place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> This was very well served, and galled their column severely. At length, about nine in the morning, the enemy advanced to the charge, with great order and vivacity, though their fire was ir∣regular and ineffectual. On the contrary, the Bri∣tish forces reserved their shot, until the French had approached within forty yards of their line: then they poured in a terrible discharge, and continued the fire with such deliberation and spirit, as could not fail to produce a very considerable effect. Ge∣neral Wolfe was stationed on the right, at the head of Bragg's regiment, and the Louisbourg grena∣diers, where the attack was most warm. As he stood conspicuous in the front of the line, he had been aimed at by the enemy's marksmen; and re∣reived a shot in the wrist, which however, did not oblige him to quit the field. Having wrapped a handkerchief round his hand, he continued giving orders without the least emotion; and advanced at the head of the grenadiers, with their bayonets fixed, when another ball unfortunately pierced the breast of this young hero <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When the fatal ball took place, general Wolfe, find∣ing himself unable to stand, leaned upon the shoulder of a lie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nant, who fat down for that purpose. This offi∣cer seeing the French give way, exclaimed, <Q>“They run! they run!”</Q> "Who run? cried the gallant Wolfe, with great eagerness. When the lieutenant replied, <Q>“The French.”</Q> <Q>“What!

<PB N="190" REF="2100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> own peculiar character. While the right pressed on with their bayonets, brigadier Murray briskly advanced with the troops under his command, and soon broke the centre of the enemy; then the High∣landers drawing their broad swords, fell in among them with irresistible impetuosity, and drove them with great slaughter into the town, and the works they had raised at the bridge of the river St. Charles. On the left and rear of the English, the action was not so violent. Some of the light infantry had thrown themselves into houses, where, being attacked, they defended themselves with great cou∣rage and resolution. Colonel Howe having taken post with two companies behind a small copse, sal∣lied out frequently on the flanks of the enemy, during this attack, and often drove them into heaps; while brigadier Townshend advanced platoons against their front: so that the right wing of the French were totally prevented from executing their first intention. The brigadier himself re∣mained with Amherst's regiment, to support this disposition, and to over-awe a body of savages, posted opposite to the light infantry; waiting for an opportunity to fall upon the rear of the British army. General Wolfe being slain, and, at the same time, Mr. Moncton dangerously wounded at the head of Lascelles's regiment, where he dis∣tinguished himself with remarkable gallantry, the command devolved to brigadier Townshend, who hastened to the centre; and finding the troops disordered in the pursuit, formed them again with all possible expedition. This necessary task was scarce performed, when M. de Bougainville, with a body of two thousand fresh men, appeared in the
<PB N="191" REF="2110"/>
rear of the English. He had begun his march<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> from cape Rouge, as soon as he received intelli∣gence that the British troops had gained the heights of Abraham; but did not come up in time to have any share in the battle.</P>
<P>Mr. Towns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end immediately ordered two batta∣lions, with two pieces of artillery, to advance a∣gainst this officer, who retired, at their reproach, among woods and swamps; where general Town∣shend very wisely declined hazarding a precarious attack. He had already obtained a complete vic∣tory; taken a great number of French officers; and was possessed of a very advantageous situation, which it would have been imprudent to forego. The French general Mr. de Montcalm was mor∣tally wounded in the battle, and conveyed into Quebec, from whence, before he died, he wrote a letter to general Townshend, recommending the prisoners to that generous humanity by which the British nation is distinguished. His second in command was left wounded on the field, and next day expired on board an English ship, to which he had been conveyed. About one thousand of the enemy were made prisoners, including a great number of officers; and about five hundred were slain on the field of battle. The wreck of their army, after they had reinforced the garrison of Quebec, retired to Point au Tremble, from whence they proceeded to Jaques Quartiers, where they remained intrenched, until they were compelled by the severity of the weather to make the best of their way to Trois Rivieres and Montreal.</P>
<P>This important victory was obtained at the ex∣pence of fifty men killed, including nine officers;
<PB N="192" REF="2120"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and of about five hundred men wounded; but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eulogium on gene∣ral Wolfe.</NOTE> death of general Wolfe was a national loss, univer∣sally lamented. He inherited from nature, an ani∣mating fervour of sentiment, an intuitive percep∣tion, an extensive capacity, and a passion for glory, which stimulated him to acquire every species of military knowledge that study could comprehend; that actual service could illustrate and confirm. This noble warmth of dispositien seldom fails to call forth and unfold the liberal virtues of the soul. Brave above all estimation of danger, he was also generous, gentle, complacent, and humane; the pattern of the officer, the darling of the soldier; there was a sublimity in his genius, which soared above the pitch of ordinary minds; and had his faculties been exercised to their full extent by op∣portunity and action; had his judgment been fully matured by age and experience, he would, without doubt, have rivalled in reputation the most celebrated captains of antiquity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Surrender of Que∣bec.</NOTE> Immediately after the battle of Quebec, admiral Saunders, who, together with his subordinates, Durell and Holmes, had all along co-operated heartily with the land-forces for the advantage of the service, sent up all the boats of the fleet, with artillery and ammunition; and, on the seventeenth day of the month, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed up, with all the ships of war, in a disposition to attack the lower town; while the upper part should be assaulted by gene∣ral Townshend.

What rendered the capitulation still more fortunate for the British general, was the in∣formation he afterwards received from deserters, importing, that the enemy had rallied, and were reinforced behind cape Rouge, under the command of Mr. de Levy, arrived from Montreal for that purpose, with two regular battalions; and that Mr. de Bougainville, at the head of eight hundred men, with a convoy of provisions, was actually on his march to throw himself into the town on the eigh∣teenth, that very morning on which it was surren∣dered: for the place was not then completely in∣vested, as the enemy had broke their bridge of boats, and posted detachments in very strong works, on the other side of the river St. Charles.</P>
<P>The capitulation was no sooner ratified, than the British forces took possession of Quebec on the land side, and guards were posted in different parts of the town, to preserve order and discipline: at the same time, captain Palliser, with a body of seamen, entered the lower town, and took the same precau∣tions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejoi∣cings in England.</NOTE> Immediately after the action at the falls of Mont∣moren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, general Wolfe had dispatched an officer to England with a detail of that disaster, written with such elegance and accuracy, as would not have disgraced the pen of a Caesar. Though the public acquiesced in his conduct, they were exceedingly mortified at his miscarriage; and this mortification was the greater, as he seemed to dispair of being able to strike any other stroke of importance, for the accomplishment of their hope, which had as∣pired at the absolute conquest of Canada. The first transports of their chag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in were not yet sub∣sided, when colonel Hale arrived in the ship Alcide, with an account of the victory and surrender of Que∣bec; which was immediately communicated to the people in an extraordinary gazette.

But they displayed a more no∣ble proof of unrestrained benevolence, extended even to foes. The French ministry, straitened in their finances, which were found scarce sufficient to maintain the war, had sacrificed their duty to their king and every sentiment of compassion for his un∣happy subjects, to a thirst of vengeance, and san∣guinary views of ambition. They had withdrawn the usual allowance from their subjects, who were detained prisoners in England; and those wretched creatures, amounting in number to near twenty thousand, were left to the mercy of those enemies whom their sovereign had taken such pains to ex∣asperate.

<P>The city of Quebec being reduced, together with great part of the circumjacent country, bri∣gadier Towmhend, who had accepted his commis∣sion with the express proviso, that he should return to England at the end of the campaign, left a gar∣rison of five thousand effective men, victualled from the fleet, under the command of brigadier Murray; and embarking with admiral Saunders, arrived in Great Britain about the beginning of winter.

<P>While the arms of Great Britain triumphed in Europe and America, her interest was not suffered to languish in other parts of the world. This was the season of ambition and activity, in which every separate armament, every distinct corps, and every individual officer, seemed to exert themselves with the most eager appetite of glory. The East Indies, which, in the course of the preceding year, had been the theatre of operations carried on with va∣rious success, exhibited nothing now but a succes∣sion of trophies to the English commanders. The
<PB N="201" REF="2220"/>
Indian transactions of the last year, we interrupted<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> at that period, when the French general Lally was employed in making preparations for the siege of Madrass. In the month of October he had marched into Arcot without opposition; and, in the begin∣ning of December, he advanced towards Madras. On the twelfth he marched over Choultry plain, in three divisions, can<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onaded by the English artil∣lery with considerable effect, and took post at Eg∣more and St. Thome. Colonel Laurence, who commanded the garrison of Madrass, retired to the island, in order to prevent the enemy from taking possession of the island-bridge; and at the same time ordered the posts to be occupied in the black town, or suburbs of Madrass. In the morning of the fourteenth, the enemy marching with their whole force to attack this place, the English detach∣ments retreated into the garrison; and within the hour a grand sally was made, under the command of colonel Draper, a gallant officer, who signalized himself remarkably on this occasion. He attacked the regiment of Lorraine with great impetuosity; and, in all probability, would have cut them off, had not they been sustained by the arrival of a fresh brigade. After a very warm dispute, in which ma∣ny officers, and a good number of men were killed on each side, colonel Draper was obliged to retreat, not altogethet satisfied with the conduct of his gre∣nadiers. As the garrison of Madrass was not very numerous, nothing further was attempted on their side without the works. In the mean time the enemy used all their diligence in erecting their bat∣teries against the fort and town; which being opened on the sixth day of January, maintained a
<PB N="202" REF="2230"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> continued discharge of shot and shells for twenty days, advancing their trenches all the time under cover of this fire, until they reached the breast of the glacis. There they erected a battery of four pieces of cannon, and opened it on the last day of the month; but for five days successively, they were obliged to close their embrasures by the su∣perior fire of the fort, and at length to abandon it intirely: nevertheless, they still maintained a severe fire from the first grand battery, which was placed at the distance of four hundred and fifty yards from the defences. This artillery was so well served, as to disable twenty-six pieces of cannon, three mor∣tars, and effect an inconsiderable breach. Perhaps they might have had more success, had they bat∣tered in breach from the beginning; but Mr. Lal∣ly, in order to intimidate the inhabitants, had cruelly bombarded the town and demolished the houses: he was, however, happily disappointed in his expectation, by the wise and resolute pre∣cautions of governor Pigot; by the vigilance, conduct, and bravery of the colonels Laurence and Draper, seconded by the valour and acti∣vity of major Brereton, and the spirit of the inferior officers. The artillery of the garrison was so well managed, that, from the fifth day of February, the fire of the enemy gradually de∣creased from twenty-three to six pieces of can∣non: nevertheless, they advanced their sap along the sea side, so as to embrace intirely the north east angle of the covered way, from whence their mus∣qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try drove the besieged. They likewise endea∣voured to open a passage into the ditch by a mine; but sprung it so injudiciously, that they could make
<PB N="203" REF="2240"/>
no advantage of it, as it lay exposed to the fire of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> several cannon. While these operations were car∣ried on before the town, major Caillaud with a body of sipoys, some of the country horse, and a few Europeans, drawn from the English garrisons of Trichenapally and Chingliput, hovered at the distance of a few miles; blocking up the roads in such a manner, that the enemy were obliged, four several times, to send large detachments against him, in order to open the communication: thus the progress of the siege was in a great measure re∣tarded. On the sixteenth day of February in the evening, the Queenborough ship of war, com∣manded by captain Kempenselt, and the company's ship the Revenge, arrived in the road of Madrass, with a reinforcement of six hundred men, be∣longing to colonel Draper's regiment: and part of them was immediately disembarked. From the beginning of the siege, the enemy had disco∣vered a backwardness in the service, very unsuit∣able to their national character. They were ill sup∣plied by their commissaries and contractors: they were discouraged by the obstinate defence of the garrison; and all their hope of success vanished at the arrival of this reinforcement. After a brisk fire, they raised the siege that very night, aban∣doning forty pieces of cannon; and, having destroyed the powder-mills at Ogmore, retreated to the ter∣ritory of Arcot <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The chagrin and mor∣tification of Lally, are strong∣ly marked in the following intercepted letter to Mr. de Legret, dated from the camp before Madrass.</P>
<P>"A good blow might be struck here: there is a ship in the road, of 20 guns, laden with all the riches of Madrass, which it is said will remain there till the 20th. The Expedition is just arriv∣ed, but M. Gorlia is not a man to attack her; for she has made him run away once before. The Bristol▪ on the other hand, did out just make her appearance before St. Thomas▪ and on the vague report of 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ships coming from Porto Novo, she took fright; and after landing the provisions with which she was laden, she would not stay long enough, even to take on board 12 of her own guns, which she had lent us for the siege.</P>

<P>Of 1500 Cipayes which at∣tended our army, I reckon near 800 are employed upon the road of Pondicherry, la∣den with sugar, pepper, and other goods; and as for the Coulis, they are all employed for the same purpose, from the first day we came here.</P>

he retired towards Wandewash, where his troops<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> were put into quarters of cantonment. No other ope∣rations ensued till the month of September, when ma∣jor Brereton, who commanded the English forces, be∣ing joined by major Gordon with three hundred men of colonel Coote's battalion, resolved to attack the enemy in his turn. On the fourteenth day of the month, he began his march from Conjiveram for Wandewash, at the head of four hundred Euro∣peans, seven thousand sipoys, seventy European, and three hundred black horse, with fourteen pieces of artillery. In his march he invested and took the fort of Trivitar, from whence he proceeded to the village of Wandewash, where the French, to the number of one thousand, were strongly encamped under the guns of a fort commanded by a raja, mounting twenty cannon, under the direction of a French gunner. On the thirtieth day of Septem∣ber, the English at two in the morning attacked the village in three different places, and drove them from it, after a very obstinate dispute; but this advantage they were not able to maintain. The black pioneers ran away during the attack; so that proper traverses could not be made in the streets; and at day-break the fort poured in upon them a prodigious discharge of grape-shot, with a considerable effect. The enemy had retired to a dry ditch, which served as an intrenchment, from whence they made furious sallies; and a body of three hundred European horse were already in mo∣tion, to fall upon and complete their confusion. In this emergency, they retired in disorder, and might have been intirely ruined, had not the body of reserve effectually covered their retreat; yet
<PB N="208" REF="2290"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> this could not be effected without the loss of several officers, and above three hundred men killed and wounded. After this mortifying check, they en∣camped a few days in sight of the fort, and the rainy season setting in, returned to Conjiveram. The fort of Wandewash was afterwards garrisoned by French and sipoys, and the other forces of the enemy were assembled by brigadier-general de Bussy at Arcot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vice ad∣miral Po∣cock <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h∣tains a th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d ad¦vantage over the French squadron com∣manded by M. D▪Apche.</NOTE> During these transactions at land, the superiority at sea was still disputed between the English and French admirals. On the first day of September, vice-admiral Pococke sailed from Madrass to the southward, inquest of the enemy; and next day descried the French fleet, consisting of fifteen sail, standing to the northward. He forthwith threw out the signal for a general chace, and stood towards them with all the sail he could carry; but the wind abating, he could not approach near enough to en∣gage. During the three succeeding days, he used his utmost endeavours to bring them to a battle, which they still declined, and at last they disap∣peared. He then directed his course to Pondi∣cherry, on the supposition that they were bound to that harbour; and on the eighth day of the month, perceived them standing to the southward: but he could not bring them to an engagement till the tenth, when Mr. d'Apche about two in the after∣noon, made the signal for battle, and the canno∣nading began without further delay. The British squadron did not exceed nine ships of the line; the enemy's fleet consisted of eleven; but they had still a greater advantage in number of men and artil∣lery. Both squadrons fought with great impetuo∣sity,

<PB N="209" REF="2310"/>
till about ten minutes after four, when the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> enemy's rear began to give way: this example was soon followed by their centre: and finally the van, with the whole squadron, bore to the south▪south∣east, with all the canvas they could spread. The British squadron was so much damaged in their masts and rigging, that they could not pursue; so that M. d' Apche retreated at his leisure unmolested. On the fifteenth, admiral Pocock returned to Ma∣drass, where his squadron being repaired by the twenty-sixth, he sailed again to Pondicherry, and in the road saw the enemy lying at anchor in line of battle. The wind being off shore, he made the line of battle a-head, and for some time continued in this situation. At length the French admiral weighed anchor, and came forth; but instead of bearing down upon the English squadron, which had fallen to leeward, he kept close to the wind, and stretched away to the southward. Admiral Po∣cock finding him averse to another engagement, and his own squadron being in no condition to pur∣sue, he, with the advice of his captains, desisted, and measured back his course to Madrass. On the side of the English, above three hundred men were killed in the engagement, including captain Michie, who commanded the Newcastle, captain Gore of the marines, two lieutenants, a master, gunner, and boatswain; the captains Somerset and Brereton, with about two hundred and fifty men were wound∣ed, and many of the ships considerably damaged. The loss of the enemy must have been much more considerable; because the English in battle always fire at the body of the ship; because the French squadron was crowded with men; because they
<PB N="210" REF="2320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> gave way, and declined a second engagement; and finally, because they now made the best of their way to the island of Mauritius, in order to be refitted, having on board general Lally, and some other offi∣cers. Thus they left the English masters of the Indian coast; a superiority still more confirmed by the ar∣rival of rear-admiral Cornish with four ships of the line, who had set sail from England in the begin∣ning of the year, and joined admiral Pocock at Madrass on the eighteenth day of October.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hostili∣ties by the Dutch in the river of Bengal.</NOTE> The French were not the only enemies with whom the English had to cope in the East-Indies. The great extension of their trade in the kingdom of Bengal, had excited the envy and avarice of the Dutch factory, who possessed a strong fort at Chin∣chura in the river of Bengal; and resolved, if pos∣sible, to engross the whole salt-petre branch of com∣merce. They had, without doubt, tampered with the new Nabob, who lay under such obligations to the English, and probably secured his connivance. Their scheme was approved by the governor of Ba∣tavia, who charged himself with the execution of it; and, for that purpose, chose the opportunity when the British squadron had retired to the coast of Malabar. On pretence of reinforcing the Dutch garrisons in Bengal, he equipped an armament of seven ships, having on board five hundred Euro∣pean troops, and six hundred Malayese, under the command of colonel Russel. This armament hav∣ing touched at Negapatam, proceeded up the bay, and arrived in the river of Bengal about the begin∣ning of October. Colonel Clive, who then resided at Calcutta, had received information of their de∣sign, which he was resolved, at all events, to de∣feat.
<PB N="211" REF="2330"/>
He complained to the Subah, who, upon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> such application, could not decently refuse an or∣der to the director and council of Hughley, im∣plying, that this armament should not proceed up the river. The colonel at the same time sent a let∣ter to the Dutch commodore, intimating, that as he had received information of their design, he could not allow them to land forces, and march to Chinchura. In answer to this declaration, the Dutch commodore, whose whole fleet had not yet arrived, assured the English commander that he had no in∣tention to send any forces to Chinchura; and begged liberty to land some of his troops for refreshment; a favour that was granted, on condition that they should not advance. Notwithstanding the Subah's order, and his own engagement to this effect, the rest of the ships were no sooner arrived, than he pro∣ceeded up the river to the neighbourhood of Tan∣nah-fort, where his forces being disembarked, began their march to Chinchura. In the mean time, by way of retaliating the affront he pre∣tended to have sustained, in being denied a passage to their own factory, he took several small vessels on the river belonging to the English company; and the Calcutta Indiaman, commanded by cap∣tain Wilson, homeward-bound, sailing down the river, the Dutchman gave him to understand, that if he presumed to pass, he would sink him without further ceremony. The English captain seeing them run out their guns, as if really resolved to put his threats in execution, returned to Calcutta, where two other India ships lay at anchor, and reported his adventure to colonel Clive, who forth∣with ordered the three ships to prepare for bat∣tle,
<PB N="212" REF="2340"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and attack the Dutch armament. The ships being properly manned, and their quarters lined with salt-petre, they fell down the river, and found the Dutch squadron drawn up in line of battle, in order to give them a warm reception, for which indeed they seemed well prepared: for three of them were mounted with thirty-six guns each; three of them with twenty-six; and the seventh carried sixteen. The duke of Dorlet, commanded by captain Forrester, being the first that approached them, dropped anchor close to their line, and be∣gan the engagement with a broadside, which was immediately returned. A dead calm unfortunately intervening▪ this single ship was for a considerable time exposed to the whole fire of the enemy; but a small breeze springing up, the Calcutta and the Hardwick advanced to her assistance, and a severe fire was maintained on both sides, till two of the Dutch ships slipping their cables, bore away, and a third was driven ashore. Their commodore thus weakened, after a few broadsides, struck his flag to captain Wilson; and the other three followed his example. The victory being thus obtained, without the loss of one man on the side of the En∣glish, captain Wilson took possession of the prizes, the decks of which were strewed with carnage, and sent the prisoners to colonel Clive at Calcutta. The detachment of troops, which they had landed to the number of eleven hundred men, was not more fortunate in their progress. Colonel Clive no sooner received intelligence that they were in full march to Chinchura, than he detached colonel Forde, with five hundred men from Calcutta, in order to oppose, and put a stop to their march
<PB N="213" REF="2350"/>
at the French gardens. He accordingly advanced<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to the northward, and entered the town of Chan∣danagore, where he sustained the fire of a Dutch party sent out from Chinchura to join and con∣duct the expected reinforcement. These being routed and dispersed, after a short action, colo∣nel Forde in the morning proceeded to a plain in the neighbourhood of Chinchura, where he found the enemy prepared to give him battle, on the twenty-fifth day of November. They even ad∣vanced to the charge with great resolution and activity; but found the fire of the English artil∣lery and battalion so intoler ably hot, that they soon give way, and were totally defeated. A con∣siderable number was killed, and the greater part of those who survived the action, was taken pri∣soners. During this contest, the Nabob, at the head of a considerable army, observed a suspicious neutrality; and in all likelihood would have de∣clared for the Dutch, had they proved victorious, as he had reason to believe they would from their great superiority in number. But fortune no sooner determined in favour of the English, than he made a tender of his service to the victor, and even offered to reduce Chinchura with his own army.</P>

<P>Art. I. The director and council of Chinchura shall give full satisfaction to the president and council of Fort William, for the insult offer∣ed to the British flag by the commanders of the Dutch ships, and for the detention of many of our vessels, which were seized and stopped in the river, contrary to the treaties which subsist between the two nations, and for the other acts of hostility com∣mitted by the said ships.</P>
<P>Ans. The director and council of Chinchura declare, that, as they have always been possessed with sentiments of peace, the troubles which have happened to disturb the good understanding between the two nations, have only served to give them a sensible pain; and every thing which has passed below, with respect to the English flag and the insults committed, is without their order, and what they re∣gret, and perhaps done by the people of the ships from a misunderstanding of their or∣ders, with which they hope the governor and council will be fully satisfied.</P>
<P>Art. II. The director and council of Chinchura shall make good, both to the com∣pany and individuals, all da∣mages done by the comman∣ders of their ships, whether by their order or not; and shall immediately restore all the vessels, stores, and effects, which may still be in their possession.</P>
<P>Ans. As the Dutch vessels have also been much damag∣ed, the real loss will be wil∣lingly made good; but it is to be hoped the governor and council will reflect equitably on this article; and, if they insist upon it, we shall endea∣vour to satisfy them.</P>

<P>Art. I. That the English shall effect the Nabob's re∣turn, or, at least, prevail on him to remain quiet in his camp, without doing us any injury; and that the articles of our agreement be accept∣ed, approved, and confirmed by the Nabob's principal, as far as they concern him, as well for the present as for the future.</P>
<P>Ans. We have already made use of all our interest with the Nabob, and shall conti∣nue to engage him to with∣draw his arms, the moment the Dutch government has fulfilled his orders. The ar∣ticles agreed on between the English and Dutch cannot be included in the treaty which the government of Hughley may conclude with the Nabob's principal.</P>
<P>Art. II. That what has passed, during the troubles which have now ceased, shall be mutually forgot; and an assurance given of a perfect friendship, fidelity, and cor∣respondence, being kept up between the two nations, by their respective chiefs, with∣out permitting any hostility on one side or the other, on any pretence whatsoever; that each shall do his utmost to preserve this good intelli∣gence▪ and to contribute, as far as possible, to the good of both, without assisting, di∣rectly or indirectly, those who would prejudice either.</P>
<P>Ans. Approved, as far as is consistent with the alliance between the Nabob and us, and while friendship subsists between our sovereigns in Europe.</P>
<P>Art. III. As we have nei∣ther acted by the declaration of war, nor by commission, our troops and mariners can∣not be considered as prisoners of war, subject to a capitula∣tion, but merely as tempora∣ry captives; and therefore ought to be set at liberty, with all military honours.</P>
<P>Ans. We don't look up∣on the Dutch officers and troops as our prisoners, but as those of the Nabob; and are therefore ready to release them as soon as they have concluded their treaty with him, except such as are wil∣ling to enter into our service, or who demand the protec∣tion of the English flag.</P>
<P>Art. IV. That they shall leave us in the free possession of our settlements, com∣merce, rights, and privile∣ges.</P>
<P>Ans. We have never inter∣rupted the Dutch in their just rights and privileges, nor ever purpose doing it.</P>
<P>Art. V▪ That all the people, possessions, settlements, lands, houses, ships, and vessels, be∣longing both to the company and individuals, and every thing belonging thereto, shall be declared free, and restored, in presence of the deputies appointed by both parties, in their proper condition.</P>
<P>Ans. All the ships and ves∣sels in our possession shall be restored as soon as our de∣mands are complied with, or on an assurance thereof given by the director and council of Hughley.</P>
<P>Art. VI. These treaties to be exchanged, with the ap∣probation of the directors of both companies, as soon as possible.</P>
<P>Ans. Granted.</P>
<P>Art. VII. Finally, the two parties shall be reciprocal gua∣rantees for the execution of the preceding articles.</P>

After all, perhaps the Dutch company meant<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> nothing more than to put their factory of Chin∣chura on a more respectable footing; and by ac∣quiring greater weight and consequence among the people of the country than they formerly pos∣sessed, the more easily extend their commerce in that part of the world. At any rate, it will ad∣mit of a dispute among those who profess the law of nature and nations, whether the Dutch com∣pany could be justly debarred the privilege of sending a reinforcement to their own garrisons. Be that as it will, the ships were not restored until the factory at Chinchura had given security to in∣demnify the English for the damage they had sus∣tained on this occasion.</P>
<P>The success of the English company was still more conspicuous on the coast of Coromandel. The governor and council of Madrass having re∣ceived information, that the French general Lally had sent a detachment of his army to the south∣ward, taken Syringham, and threatened Triche∣napally with a siege, it was determined that colo∣nel Coote, who had lately arrived from England,
<PB N="218" REF="2400"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> should take the field and endeavour to make a di∣version to the southward. He accordingly began his march at the head of seventeen hundred Eu∣ropeans, including cavalry, and three thousand Blacks, with fourteen pieces of cannon and one<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonel Coote re∣duces the fort of Wande∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ash.</NOTE> howitz. On the twenty-seventh day of November he invested the fort of Wandewash: having made a practicable breach, the garrison, consisting of near nine hundred men, surrendered prisoners of war; and he found in the place forty-nine pieces of cannon, with a great quantity of ammunition. Then he undertook the siege of Carangoly, a for∣tress commanded by colonel O'Kennely, at the head of one hundred Europeans, and five hundred sipoys. In a few days he dismounted the greater part of their guns; and they submitted, on condi∣tion, that the Europeans should be allowed to march out with the honours of war; but the Sipoys were disarmed, and dismissed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He gives battle to general Lally▪ who is defeated.</NOTE> General Lally, alarmed at the progress of this brave, vigilant, and enterprising officer, assembled all his forces at Arcot, to the number of two thou∣sand two hundred Europeans, including horse, three hundred Cofferies, and ten thousand black troops, or sipoys, with five and twenty pieces of cannon. Of these he assumed the command in per∣son; and on the tenth day of January began his march, in order to recover Wandewash. Colonel Coote, having received intelligence on the twelfth that he had taken possession of Conjeveram, endea∣voured by a forced march to save the place, which they accordingly abandoned at his approach, and pursuing their march to Wandewash, invested
<PB N="219" REF="2410"/>
the fort without delay. The English commander<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> passed the river Palla, in order to follow the same route; and, on the twenty-first day of the month, understanding that a breach was already made, resolved to give them battle without further delay. The cavalry being formed, and support∣ed by five companies of Sipoys, he advanced against the enemy's horse, which, being at the same time galled by two pieces of cannon, re∣tired with precipitation. Then colonel Coote, having taken possession of a tank which they had occupied, returned to the line, which was by this time formed in order of battle. Seeing the men in high spirits, and eager to engage, he ordered the whole army to advance; and by nine in the morning they were within two miles of the enemy's camp, where they halted about half an hour. During this interval, the colonel reconnoitered the situation of the French forces, who were very ad∣vantageously posted, and made a movement to the right, which obliged them to alter their disposition. They now advanced, in their turn, within three quarters of a mile of the English line; and the cannonading began with great fury on both sides. About noon their European cavalry coming up with a resolute air to charge the left of the English, colonel Coote brought up some companies of sipoys, and two pieces of cannon, to sustain the horse, which were ordered to oppose them; and these advancing on their flank, disturbed them so much that they broke, and were driven by the English cavalry above a mile from the left, upon the rear of their own army. Mean while, both
<PB N="220" REF="2420"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> lines continued advancing to each other; and about one o'clock the firing with sma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l arms be∣gan with great vivacity. One of the French tum∣brils being blown up by an accidental shot, the English commander took immediate advantage of their confusion. He ordered major Brereton to wheel Draper's regiment to the left, and fall upon the enemy's flank. This service was performed with such resolution and success, that the left wing of the French was compleatly routed, and fell upon their centre, now closely engaged with the left of the English. About two in the after∣noon their whole line gave way, and fled towards their own camp, which, perceiving themselves closely pursued, they precipitately abandoned, toge∣ther with twenty-two pieces of cannon. In this engagement they lost about eight hundred men, killed and wounded, besides about fifty prisoners, including brigadier-general de Bussy, the chevalier Godeville, quarter-master-general, lieutenant▪colo∣nel Murphy, three captains, five lieutenants, and some other officers. On the side of the English two hundred and sixty-two were killed or wounded, and among the former the gallant and accomplished major Brereton, whose death was a real loss to his country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He con∣quers the province of Arcot.</NOTE> General Lally having retreated with his broken troops to Pondicherry, the baron de Vasserot was detached towards the same place, with a thousand horse and three hundred sipoys, to ravage and lay waste the French territory.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the indefatigable colonel Coote undertook the siege of Chilliput, which in
<PB N="221" REF="2430"/>
two days was surrendered by the chevalier de Til∣ly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> himself and his garrison remaining prisoners of war. Such also was the sate of fort Timmery, which being reduced, the colonel prosecuted his march to Arcot, the capital of the province, against the fort of which he opened his batteries on the fifth day of February. When he had carried on his approaches within sixty yards of the crest of the glacis, the garrison, consisting of two hundred and fifty Europeans, and near three hundred si∣poys, surrendered as prisoners of war; and here the English commander found two and twenty pieces of cannon, four mortars, and a great quan∣tity of all kind of military stores.</P>

But first it may be necessary to sketch out the situations in which the belligerant pow∣ers were found at the close of winter. The vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s∣situdes of fortune, with which the preceding cam∣paign
<PB N="222" REF="2440"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> had been checquered, were sufficient to con∣vince every potentate concerned in the war, that neither side possessed such a superiority in strength or conduct, as was requisite to impose terms upon the other. Battles had been fought with various success; and surprising efforts of military skill had been ex∣hibited, without producing one event which tended to promote a general peace, or even engender the least desire of accommodation: on the contrary, the first and most violent transports of animosity had by this time subsided into a confirmed habit of de∣liberate hatred; and every contending power seemed more than ever determined to protract the dispute; while the neutral states kept aloof, with∣out expressing the least desire of interposing their mediation. Some of them were restrained by consi∣derations of conveniency; and others waited in sus∣pence for the death of the Spanish monarch, as an event which they imagined would be attended with very important consequences in the southern parts of Europe. With respect to the maintenance of the war, whatever difficulties might have arisen in set∣tling funds to support the expence, and finding men to recruit the different armies, certain it is all these difficulties were surmounted before the opening of the campaign. The court of Vienna, tho' hampered by the narrowness of its finances, still found resources in the fertility of its provinces, in the number and attachment of its subjects, who, more than any other people in Europe, acquiesce in the dispositions of their sovereign; and, when pay cannot be afforded, willingly contribute free quarters for the subsistence of the army. The
<PB N="223" REF="2450"/>
Czarina, though she complained that the stipulated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> subsidies were ill payed, nevertheless persisted in pursuing those favourite aims which had for some time influenced her conduct; namely, her personal animosity to the king of Prussia, and her desire of obtaining a permanent interest in the German em∣pire. Sweden still made a shew of hostility against the Prussian monarch; but continued to slumber over the engagements she had contracted. France, exhausted in her finances, and abridged of her ma∣rine commerce, maintained a resolute countenance▪ supplied fresh armies for her operations in West∣phalia, projected new schemes of conquest, and ca∣joled her allies with fair promises, when she had nothing more solid to bestow. The king of Prus∣sia's dominions were generally drained, or in the hands of the enemy; but, to ballance these disad∣vantages, he kept possession of Saxony, and en∣joyed his annual subsidy from Great Britain, which effectually enabled him to maintain his armies on a respectable footing, and open the campaign with equal eagerness and confidence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Frankfort seized by the French.</NOTE> The Hanoverian army, commanded by prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, was strengthened by fresh reinforcements from England, augmented with Germain recruits, regularly paid, and well supplied with every comfort and convenience which fore∣sight could suggest, or money procure; yet, in spight of all the precautions that could be taken, they were cut off from some resources, which the French, in the beginning of the year, opened to themselves by a flagrant stroke of perfidy, which even the extreme necessities of a campaign can

On the second day of January, the French regiment of Nassau presenting itself before the gate of Frankfort on the Mayne, a neutral im∣perial city, and demanding a passage, it was in∣troduced, and conducted by a detachment of the garrison, through the city as far as the gate of Saxen▪hausen, where it unexpectedly halted, and immediately disarmed the guards. Be∣fore the inhabitants could recover from the con∣sternation into which they were thrown by this out∣rageous insult, five other French regiments en∣tered the place, and here their general the prince de Soubise established his head-quarters. How deeply soever this violation of the laws of the Em∣pire might be resented by all honest Germans, who retained affection for the constitutions of their country; it was a step from which the French ar∣my derived a very manifest and important advan∣tage; for it secured to them the course of the Maine and the Upper Rhine; by which they re∣ceived, without difficulty or danger, every species of supply, from Mentz, Spire, Worms, and even the country of Alsace; while it maintained their communication with the chain formed by the Aus∣trian forces and the army of the Empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the heredi∣tary prince of Bruns∣wick.</NOTE> The scheme of operations for the ensuing cam∣paign was already formed between the king of Prussia and prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; and before the armies took the field, several skirmishes were fought, and quarters surprised.

In a few days, however, they themselves retreated again with great precipitation, though they did not all escape. The hereditary prince of Brunswick, with a body of Prussian hussars, fell upon them suddenly at Molrichstadt, where he routed and dispersed a regiment of Hohenzollern cuirassiers, and a battalion of the troops of Wurtz∣burg. He next day, which was the first of April, advanced with a body of horse and foot to Mei∣nungen, where he found a considerable magazine, took two battalions prisoners, and surprised a third posted at Wafungen, after having defeated some Austrian troops that were on the march to its re∣lief. While the hereditary prince was thus em∣ployed, the duke of Holstein, with another body of the confederates, dislodged the French from the post of Freyinstenau.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdi∣nand at∣tacks tho French at Bergen.</NOTE> But the great object was to drive the enemy from Frankfort, before they should receive the expected reinforcements. Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, being determined upon this enterprize, assembled all his forces near Fulda, to the amount of forty thousand choice troops, and began his march on the tenth day of April. On the thir∣teenth he came in sight of the enemy, whom he found strongly encamped about the village of Ber∣gen, between Frankfort and Hanau. Their ge∣neral,
<PB N="226" REF="2480"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the duke de Broglio, counted one of the best officers in France, with respect to conduct and intrepidity, having received intelligence of the prince's design, occupied this post on the twelfth, the right of his army being at Bergen, and his centre and flanks secured in such a manner, that the allies could not make their attack any other way but by the village. Notwithstanding the ad∣vantage of their situation, prince Ferdinand resolved to give them battle, and made his dispositions ac∣cordingly. About ten in the morning the grena∣diers of the advanced guard began the attack on the village of Bergen with great vivacity, and sus∣tained a most terrible fire from eight German bat∣talions, supported by several brigades of French insantry. The grenadiers of the allied army, though supported by several battalions under the command of the prince of Ysembourg, far from dislodging the enemy from the village, were, after a very obstinate dispute, obliged to retreat in some disorder; but rallied again behind a body of Hes∣sian cavalry. The allies being repulsed in three different attacks, their general made a new dispo∣sition, and brought up his artillery, with which the village and different parts of the French line were severely cannonaded. They were not slow in retorting an equal fire, which continued till night, when the allies retreated to Windeken, with the loss of five pieces of cannon, and about two thou∣sand men, including the prince of Ysembourg, who fell in the action.</P>
<P>The French, by the nature of their situation, could not suffer much; but they were so effectually amused by the artful disposition of prince Ferdi∣nand,

Indeed, they had great reason to be satisfied with the issue of this battle, without risquing, in any measure, the advantage which they had gained. It was their business to remain quiet, until their reinforcements should arrive, and this plan they invariably pursued.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the allies, in consequence of their miscarriage, were reduced to the necessity of acting upon the defensive, and encountering a great number of difficulties and inconveniencies, during great part of the campaign, until the mis∣conduct of the enemy turned the scale in their favour. In the mean time, the prince thought proper to begin his retreat in the night towards Fulda, in which his rear suffered considerably from a body of the enemy's light troops under the command of M. de Blaisel, who surprised two squadrons of dra∣goons, and a battalion of grenadiers. The first were taken or dispersed; the last escaped with the loss of their baggage. The allied army returned to their cantonments about Munster, and the prince began to make preparations for taking the field in earnest.</P>

Ferdinand, finding himself inferior to the united<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> forces of the enemy, was obliged to retire as they advanced, after having lest strong garrisons in Lip∣stadt, Retberg, Munster, and Minden. These pre∣cautions, however, seemed to produce little effect in his favour. Retberg was surprised by the duke of Broglio, who likewise took Minden by assault, and made general Zastrow, with his garrison of fif∣teen hundred men, prisoners of war; a misfortune considerably aggravated by the loss of an immense magazine of hay and corn, which fell into the hands of the enemy. They likewise made them∣selves masters of Munster, invested Lipstadt, and all their operations were hitherto crowned with success. The regency of Hanover, alarmed at their progress, resolved to provide for the worst, by sending their chancery and most valuable effects to Stade; from whence, in case of necessity, they might be conveyed by sea to England. In the mean time, they exerted all their industry in press∣ing men for recruiting and reinforcing the army under prince Ferdinand, who still continued to re∣tire; and on the eleventh day of July removed his head-quarters from Osnabrug to Bomte, near the Weser.

He therefore insisted upon the army's retreating, so as to keep the communication open with Stade, where, in case of emergency, the Eng∣lish troops might be embarked. By adhering te∣naciously to this opinion, and exhibiting other in∣stances of a prying disposition, he had rendered him∣self so disagreeable to the commander in chief, that, in all appearance, nothing was so eagerly desired as an opportunity of removing him from the station he filled.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French army en∣camp at Minden.</NOTE> Mean while, the French general advancing to Minden, encamped in a strong situation, having that town on his right, a steep hill on his left, a morass in front, and a rivulet in rear. The duke de Broglio commanded a separate body between Hansbergen and Minden, on the other side of the Weser; and a third, under the duke de Brissac, consisting of eight thousand men, occupied a strong post by the village of Coveldt, to facilitate the route of the convoys from Paderborn. Prince Fer∣dinand, having moved his camp from Soltzenau to Petershagen, detached the hereditary prince on the twenty-eighth day of July to Lubeke, from whence he drove the enemy; and, proceeding to Rimsel, was joined by major-general Dreves, who had re∣taken Osnabrug, and cleared all that neighbour∣hood

of the enemy's parties: then he advanced<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> towards Hervorden, and fixed his quarters at Kirchlinneger, to hamper the enemy's convoys from Paderborn. During these transactions, prince Fer∣dinand marched with the allied army in three co∣lumns from Petershagen to Hille, where it en∣camped, having a morass on the right, the village of Friedewalde on the left, and in front those of Northemmern and Holtzenhausen. Fifteen batta∣lions and nineteen squadrons, with a brigade of heavy artillery, were left under the command of general Wangenheim on the left, behind the vil∣lage of Dodenhausen, which was fortified with some redoubts, defended by two battalions. Colonel Luckner, with the Hanoverian hussars and a bri∣gade of hunters, sustained by two battalions of grenadiers, was posted between Buckebourg and the Weser, to observe the body of troops com∣manded by the duke of Broglio on the other side of the river.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are de∣feated by the allies.</NOTE> On the last day of July the marechal de Con∣tades, resolving to attack the allied army, ordered the corps of Broglio to repass the river; and ad∣vancing in eight columns, about midnight, passed the rivulet of Barta, that runs along the morass, and falls into the Weser at Minden. At day-break he formed his army in order of battle, part of it fronting the corps of general Wangenheim at Dodenhausen, and part of it facing Hilie; the two wings consisting of infantry, and the cavalry being stationed in the centre. At three in the morning the enemy began to cannonade the prince's quar∣ters at Hille from a battery of six cannon, which they had raised in the preceding evening on the
<PB N="232" REF="2550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> dyke of Eickhorst. This was probably the first inti∣mation he received of their intention. He forthwith caused two pieces of artillery to be conveyed to Hille, and ordered the officer of the piquet-guard there posted to defend himself to the last extremi∣ty: at the same time he sent orders to general Gie∣sen, who occupied Lubeke, to attack the enemy's post at Eickhorst; and this service was successfully performed. The prince of Anhalt, lieutenant-general for the day, took possession with the rest of the piquets of the village of Halen, where prince Ferdinand resolved to support his right. It was al∣ready in the hands of the enemy; but they soon abandoned it with precipitation. The allied army, being put in motion, advanced in eight columns, and occupied the ground between Halen and Hem∣mern, while general Wangenheim's corps filled up the space between this last village and Doden∣hausen. The enemy made their principal effort on the left, intending to force the infantry of Wan∣genheim's corps, and penetrate between it and the body of the allied army. For this purpose the duke de Broglio attacked them with great fury; but was severely checked by a battery of thirty cannon, prepared for his reception by the count de Buckebourg, grand master of the artillery, and served with admirable effect, under his own eye and direction. About five in the morning, both armies cannonaded each other: at six the fire of musquetry began with great vivacity, and the action became very hot towards the right, where six regiments of English infantry, and two batta∣lions of Hanoverian guards, not only bore the whole brunt of the French carabineers and gen∣darmerie,

but absolutely broke every body of horse<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and foot that advanced to attack them on the left and in the centre. The Hessian cavalry, with some regiments of Holstein, Prussian, and Hanoverian dragoons, posted on the left, performed good ser∣vice. The cavalry on the right had no opportu∣nity of engaging. They were destined to support the infantry of the third line: they consisted of the British and Hanoverian horse, commanded by lord George Sackville, whose second was the marquis of Granby. They were posted at a considerable dis∣tance from the first line of infantry, and divided from it by a wood that bordered on a heath. Or∣ders were sent, during the action, to bring them up; but whether these orders were contradictory, unintelligible, or imperfectly executed, they did not arrive in time to have any share in the action; nor, indeed, were they originally intended for that purpose; nor was there the least occasion for their service; nor could they have come up in time and condition to perform effectual service, had the or∣ders been explicit and consistent, and the com∣mander acted with all possible expedition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the general was not pleased with the behaviour of lord G—S—, may be gathered from the following compliment to the marquis of G—, implying a severe reflexion upon his superior in command.</P>

To the extraordinary prowefs of these gallant brigades, and the fire of the British artillery, which was ad∣mirably served by the captains Phillips, Macbean, Drummond, and Foy, the victory was in a great measure ascribed.

The hereditary prince, having recon∣noitred the avenues in person, took such measures, that the troops of Wirtemberg, who were scat∣tered in small bodies, would have been cut off, if
<PB N="241" REF="2640"/>
they had not hastily retired into the town, where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759▪</NOTE> however, they found no shelter. The prince for∣ced open the gates; and they retreated to the other side of the town, where four battalions of them were defeated and taken; while the duke himself, with the rest of his forces, filed off on the other side of the Fulda. Two pieces of cannon, two pair of colours, and all their baggage, fell into the hands of the victors; and the hereditary prince advanced as far as Rupertenrade, a place situated on the right flank of the French army. Perhaps this motion hastened the resolution of the duke de Broglio to abandon Giessen, and fall back to Freidberg, where he established his head-quarters. The allied army immediately took possession of his camp at Klein∣linnes and Heuchelam, and seemed to make pre∣parations for the siege of Giessen. While both ar∣mies remained in this position, the duke de Brog∣lio received the staff as marechal of France, and made an attempt to beat up the quarters of the allies. Having called in all his detachments, he marched up to them on the twenty-fifth day of December; but found them so well disposed to give him a warm reception, that he thought pro∣per to lay aside his design, and nothing but a mu∣tual cannonade ensued: then he returned to his former quarters.

Thus, by the victory at Minden, the dominions of Hanover and Brunswick were preserved, and the enemy obliged to evacuate great part of Westphalia. Perhaps they might have been driven to the other side of the Rhine, had not the general of the allies been obliged to weaken his army for the support of the Prussian monarch, who had met with divers disasters in the course of this campaign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A body of Prussians make an excursion into Po∣land.</NOTE> It was not to any relaxation or abatement of his usual vigilance and activity, that this warlike prince owed the several checks he received. Even in the middle of winter, his troops, under general Man∣teufel, acted with great spirit against the Swedes in Pomerania. They made themselves masters of Damgarten, and several other places which the Swedes had garrisoned; and, the frost setting in, those who were quartered in the isle of Usedom passed over the ice to Wolgast, which they reduced without much difficulty. They undertook the sieges of Demmen and Anclam at the same time, and the garrisons of both surrendered themselves prisoners of war, to the number of two thousand seven hundred men, including officers. In Dem∣men they found four and twenty pieces of cannon, with a large quantity of ammunition. In Anclam there was a consideerable magazine, with six and thirty cannon, mortars, and howitzers. A large detachment under general Knobloch surprised Er∣furth, and raised considerable contributions at Go∣tha, Eisenach, and Fulda; from whence also they conveyed all the forage and provisions to Saxe-Naumberg. In the latter end of February, the Prussian major-general Wobersnow marched with a

strong body of troops from Glogau in Silesia to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> Poland; and advancing by the way of Lissa, at∣tacked the castle of the prince Sulkowski, a Polish grandee, who had been very active against the in∣terest of the Prussian monarch. After some re∣sistance, he was obliged to surrender at discretion, and was sent prisoner with his whole garrison to Silesia. From hence Wobersnow proceeded to Posna, where he made himself master of a consi∣derable magazine, guarded by two thousand Cos∣sacks, who retired at his approach; and, having destroyed several others, returned to Silesia. In April, the fort of Penamunde in Pomerania was surrendered to Manteufel; and about the same time a detachment of Prussian troops bombarded Schwerin, the capital of Mecklemburg. Mean while, reinforcements were sent to the Russian ar∣my in Poland, which in April began to assemble upon the Vistula. The court of Petersburg had likewise begun to equip a large fleet, by means of which the army might be supplied with military stores and provisions: but this armament was re∣tarded by an accidental fire at Revel, which de∣stroyed all the magazines and materials for ship∣building, to an immense value.</P>

This advantage, however, was more than counterballanced by the activity and success of prince Henry, brother to the Prussian king, who commanded the army which wintered in Saxony. About the middle of April he march∣ed in two columns towards Bohemia, forced the pass of Peterswalde, destroyed the Austrian maga∣zine at Aussig, burned their boats upon the Elbe, seized the forage and provision which the enemy had left at Lowositz and Leutmeritz, and demo∣lished a new bridge which they had built for their convenience. At the same time, general Huls<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n attacked the pass of Passberg, guarded by general Renard, who was taken, with two thousand men, including fifty officers: then he advanced to Satz, in hope of securing the Austrian magazines: but these the enemy consumed, that they might not fall into his hands, and retired towards Prague with the utmost precipitation.</P>

He according∣ly entered this country, by the way of Hoff, on the seventh of May, and next day sent a detachment to attack general Macguire, who commanded a body of Imperialists at Asch, and sustained the charge with great gallantry; but finding himself in dan∣ger

of being overpowered by numbers, he retired<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> in the night towards Egra. The army of the Empire, commanded by the prince de Deux∣ponts, being unable to cope with the Prussian general in the field, retired from Cullembach to Bamberg, and from thence to Nuremberg, where, in all probability, they would not have been suffered to remain unmolested, had not prince Henry been recalled to Saxony. He had already taken Cronach and the castle of Rotenberg, and even advanced as far as Bamberg, when he re∣ceived advice that a body of Austrians, under ge∣neral Gemmingen, had penetrated into Saxony. This diversion effectually saved the army of the Empire, as prince Henry immediately returned to the electorate, after having laid the bishopric of Bamberg, and the marquisate of Cullembach, un∣der contribution, destroyed all the magazines pro∣vided for the Imperial army, and sent fifteen hun∣dred prisoners to Leipsic. A party of Imperialists, under count Palfy, endeavoured to harrass him in his retreat; but they were defeated near Hoff, with considerable slaughter: nevertheless the Im∣perial army, though now reduced to ten thousand men, returned to Bamberg; and as the Prussians approached the frontiers of Saxony, the Austrian general Gemmingen retired into Bohemia. During all these transactions, the marechal count Daun remained with the grand Austrian army at Schur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z in the circle of Koningsgratz; while the Prussians, commanded by the king in person, continued quietly encamped between Landshut and Schweid∣nitz.

<PB N="251" REF="2740"/>
finding it greatly inferior to the enemy, he re∣called<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> general Finck, whom he had detached some time before, with a body of nine thousand men, to oppose the progress of the Imperialists in Saxony: for when prince Henry joined his brother in Sile∣sia, the army of the Empire had entered that elec∣torate. Thus reinforced, the number of the king's army at Muhlrose did not exceed fifty thousand, whereas the Russians were more numerous by thirty thousand. They had chosen a strong camp at the village of Cunersdorf, almost opposite to Frankfort upon the Oder, and encreased the natural strength of their situation by intrenchments mounted with a numerous artillery. In other circumstances, it might have been deemed a rash and ridiculous en∣terprize, to attack such an army under such com∣plicated disadvantages: but here was no room for hesitation. The king's affairs seemed to require a desperate effort; and perhaps he was partly im∣pelled by self▪confidence and animosity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Cuners∣dorf.</NOTE> Having determined to hazard an attack, he made his disposition, and on the twelfth day of August at two in the morning his troops were in motion. The army being formed in a wood, ad∣vanced towards the enemy; and about eleven, the action was begun with a severe cannonade. This having produced the desired effect, he charged the left wing of the Russian army with his best troops formed in columns. After a very obsti∣nate dispute the enemy's entrenchments were for∣ced with great slaughter, and seventy pieces of cannon fell into the hands of the Prussians. A narrow desile was afterwards passed, and several re∣doubts
<PB N="252" REF="2750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> that covered the village of Cunersdorf were taken by assault, one after another. One half of the task was not yet performed: the Russians made a firm stand at the village; but they were over∣borne by the impetuosity of the Prussians, who drove them from post to post up to the last re∣doubts they had to defend. As the Russians kept their ground until they were hewn down in their ranks, this success was not acquired without infi∣nite labour, and a considerable expence of blood. After a furious contest of six hours, fortune seemed to declare so much in favour of the Prussians, that the king dispatched the following billet to the queen at Berlin: "Madam, we have driven the Russians from their intrenchments. In two hours expect to hear of a glorious victory." This intimation was premature, and subjected the writer to the ridicule of his enemies. The Russians were staggered, not routed. General Soltikoff rallied his troops, and re∣inforced his left wing under cover of a redoubt, which was erected on an eminence called the Jews Burying-ground, and here they stood in order of battle, with the most resolute countenance; fa∣voured by the situation, which was naturally diffi∣cult of access, and now rendered almost impreg∣nable by the fortification, and a numerous artillery, still greatly superior to that of the Prussians. Had the king contented himself with the advantage already gained, all the world would have acknowledged he had fought against terrible odds with astonishing prowess; and that he judiciously desisted, when he could no longer persevere without incurring the imputation of being actuated by frenzy or despair.
<PB N="253" REF="2760"/>
His troops had not only suffered severely from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> enemy's fire, which was close, deliberate, and well directed, but they were fatigued by the hard service, and fainting with the heat of the day, which was ex∣cessive. His general officers are said to have re∣minded him of all these circumstances; and to have dissuaded him from hazarding an attempt attended with such danger and difficulty, as even an army of fresh troops could hardly hope to surmount. He rejected this salutary advice, and ordered his infantry to begin a new attack, which being an enterprise beyond their strength, they were repulsed with great slaughter. Being afterwards rallied, they returned to the charge: they miscarried again, and their loss was redoubled. Being thus rendered unfit for further service, the cavalry succeeded to the attack, and repeated their unsuccessful efforts, until they were almost broke and entirely exhausted. At this critical juncture, the whole body of the Austrian and Russian cavalry, which had hitherto remained inactive, and were therefore fresh and in spirits, fell in among the Prussian horse with great fury, broke that line at the first charge, and forcing them back upon the infantry, threw them into such disorder as could not be repaired. The Prussian army being thus involved in confusion, was seized with a pannic, and in a few minutes totally de∣feated and dispersed, notwithstanding the personal efforts of the king, who hazarded his life in the hottest parts of the battle, led on his troops three times to the charge, while two horses were killed under him, and his cloaths, in several parts, penetrated with musquet▪balls. His army being
<PB N="254" REF="2770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> routed, and the greater part of his generals either killed or disabled by wounds, nothing but the ap∣proach of night could have saved him from total ruin. When he abandoned the field of battle, he dispatched another billet to the queen, couched in these terms: "Remove from Berlin with the royal family. Let the archives be carried to Potsdam. The town may make conditions with the enemy." The horror and confusion which this intimation produced at Berlin may be easily conceived: hor∣ror the more aggravated, as it seized them in the midst of their rejoicing occasioned by the first dis∣patch; and this was still more dreadfully aug∣mented, by a subsequent indistinct relation, import∣ing, that the army was totally routed, the king missing, and the enemy in full march to Berlin. The battle of Cunersdorf was by far by the most bloody action that had happened since the com∣mencement of hostilities. The carriage was truly horrible: above twenty thousand Prussians lay dead on the field, and among these general Put∣kammer. The generals Seidlitz, Itzenplitz, Hul∣sen, Finck, and Wedel, the prince of Wurtem∣berg, and five major-generals, were wounded. The loss of the enemy amounted to ten thousand. It must be owned, that if the king was prodigal of his own person, he was likewise very free with the lives of his subjects. At no time, since the days of ig∣norance and barbarity, have the lives of men been squandered away with such profusion as in the course of this German war. They have not only been unnecessarily sacrificed in various exploits of no consequence, but they have been lavishly exposed
<PB N="255" REF="2780"/>
to all the rigour and distemper of winter-cam∣paigns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> which have been introduced on the conti∣nent, in despite of nature, and in contempt of hu∣manity. Such are the improvements of warriors without feeling; such the refinements of German discipline.</P>
<P>On the day that succeeded the defeat at Cuners∣dorf, the king of Prussia, having lost the best part of his army, together with his whole train of ar∣tillery, repassed the Oder, and encamped at Ret∣win; from whence he advanced to Fustenwalde, and saw with astonishment the forbearance of the enemy. Instead of taking possession of Berlin, and overwhelming the wreck of the king's troops, de∣stitute of cannon, and cut off from all communica∣tion with prince Henry, they took no step to im∣prove the victory they had gained. Laudohn re∣tired with his horse immediately after the battle; and count Soltikoff marched with part of the Rus∣sians into Lusatia, where he joined Daun, and held consultations with that general. Perhaps the safety of the Prussian monarch was owing to the jealousy subsisting among his enemies. In all probability the court of Vienna would have been chagrined to see the Russians in possession of Brandenburgh, and therefore thwarted their designs upon that electorate. The k—of P—had now reason to be convinced, that his situation could not justify such a desperate attack as that in which he had mis∣carried at Cunersdorf; for if the Russians did not attempt the reduction of his capital, now that he was totally defeated, and the flower of his army cut off, they certainly would not have aspired at that conquest while he lay encamped in the neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="256" REF="2790"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> with fifty thousand veterans, inured to war, accustomed to conquer, confident of success, and well supplied with provision, ammunition, and artillery.</P>
<P>As the victors allowed him time to breathe, he improved this interval with equal spirit and saga∣city. He reassembled and refreshed his broken troops; he furnished his camp with cannon from the arsenal at Berlin, which likewise supplied him with a considerable number of recruits; he re∣called general Kleist, with five thousand men, from Pomerania; and, in a little time, retrieved his for∣mer importance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Advan∣tages gained by the Prus∣sians in Saxony.</NOTE> The army of the Empire having entered Sax∣ony, where it reduced Leipsic, Torgau, and even took possession of Dresden itself, the king detached six thousand men under general Wunch, to check the progress of the Imperialists in that electorate; and perceiving the Russians intended to besiege Great Glogau, he, with the rest of his army, took post between them and that city, so as to frustrate their design. While the four great armies, com∣manded by the king of Prussia, general Soltikoff, prince Henry, and count Daun, lay encamped in Lusatia, and on the borders of Silesia, watching the motions of each other, the war was carried on by detachments with great vivacity. General Wunch having retaken Leipsic, and joined Finck at Eulinbourg, the united body began their march towards Dresden; and a detachment from the ar∣my of the Empire, which had encamped near Do∣belin, retired at their approach. As they advanced to Nossin, general Haddick abandoned the ad∣vantageous post he occupied near Roth Scemberg,
<PB N="257" REF="2800"/>
and, being joined by the whole army of the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> resolved to attack the Prussian generals, who now encamped at Corbitz near Meissen; accordingly, on the twenty-first day of September he advanced against them, and endeavoured to dislodge them by a furious cannonade, which was mutually main∣tained from morning to night, when he found him∣self obliged to retire with considerable loss; leav∣ing the field of battle, with about five hundred pri∣soners, in the hands of the Prussians.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Henry makes a forced march, and sur∣prises ge∣neral Vehla▪</NOTE> This advantage was succeeded by another ex∣ploit of prince Henry; who, on the twenty-third day of the month, quitted his camp at Horns∣dorf, near Gorlitz, and, after an incredible march of eleven German miles, by the way of Rothen∣burg, arrived, about five in the afternoon, at Hoyerswerda, where he surprised a body of four thousand men commanded by general Vehla, kill∣ed six hundred, and made twice that number pri∣soners; including the commander himself. Af∣ter this atchievement, he joined the corps of Finck and Wunch; while marechal Daun likewise aban∣doned his camp in Lusatia, and made a forced march to Dresden, in order to frustrate the prince's sup∣posed design on that capital. The Russians, disap∣pointed in their scheme upon Glogau, had re∣passed the Oder at Neusalze, and were encamped at Fraustadt; general Laudohn, with a body of Au∣strians, lay at Schlichtingskeim; and the king of Prussia at Koben: all three on, or near the banks of that river.

It was forth∣with divided into four columns, which filed off through the neighbouring woods; and the Prus∣sians never dreamed of their approach, until they saw themselves intirely surrounded. In this emer∣gency they defended themselves with their cannon and musquetry, until they were overpowered by numbers, and their battery was taken: then they retired to another rising-ground, where they ral∣lied; but were driven from em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nence to eminence, until, by favour of the night, they made their last retreat to Falkenhayn. In the mean time, count Daun had made such dispositions, that at day-break general Finck sound himself int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rely inclosed, with∣out the least possibility of escaping, and sent a trumpet to count Daun to demand a capitulation. This was granted in one single article importing▪ that he and eight other Prussian generals, with the whole body of troops they commanded, should be received as prisoners of war. He was obliged to submit; and his whole corps, amounting to nineteen battalions and thirty-five squadrons, with sixty-four pieces of cannon, fifty pair of colours,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> and twenty-five standards, fell into the hands of the Austrian general.</P>
<P>This misfortune was the more mortifying to the king of Prussia, as it implied a censure on his con∣duct, for having detached such a numerous body of troops to a situation where they could not be sustained by the rest of his army.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the court of Vienna exulted in this victory as an infallible proof of Daun's su∣perior talents; and, in point of glory and advan∣tage, much more than an equivalent for the loss of the Saxon army, which, though less numerous, ca∣pitulated in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, after having held out six weeks against the whole power of the Prussian monarch.</P>
<P>General Hulsen had been detached with about nine battalions and thirty squadrons to the assist∣ance of Finck; but he arrived at Klingenberg too late to be of any service; and being recalled, was next day sent to occupy the important post of Frey∣berg.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disaster of the Prussian general Diercke.</NOTE> The defeat of general Finck was not the only disaster which befel the Prussians at the close of this campaign.

<PB N="261" REF="2840"/>
The king of Prussia, weakened by these two succes∣sive<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> defeats, that happened in the rear of an un∣fortunate campaign, would hardly have been able to maintain his ground at Freyberg, had not he been at this juncture reinforced by the body of troops under the command of the hereditary prince of Brunswic. As for Daun, the advantages he had gained did not elevate his mind above the usual maxims of his cautious discretion. Instead of at∣tacking the king of Prussia, respectable and for∣midable even in adversity, he quietly occupied the strong camp at Pirna, where he might be at hand to succour Dresden, in case it should be attacked, and maintain his communication with Bohemia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu∣sion of the cam∣paign.</NOTE> By this time the Russians had retired to winter quarters in Poland; and the Swedes, after a fruit∣less excursion in the absence of Manteufel, re∣treated to Stralsund in the isle of Rugen. This campaign, therefore, did not prove more decisive than the last. Abundance of lives were lost; and great part of Germany was exposed to rapine, mur∣der, famine, desolation, and every species of misery that war could engender. In vain the confede∣rating powers of Austria, Russia, and Sweden, united their efforts to crush the Prussian monarch. Though his army had been defeated, and he him∣self totally overthrown, with great slaughter, in the heart of his own dominions; though he appeared in a desperate situation, environed by hostile ar∣mies, and two considerable detached bodies of his troops were taken or destroyed; yet he kept all his adversaries at bay till the approach of winter, which proved his best auxiliary; and even maintained his footing in the electorate of Saxony, which seemed
<PB N="262" REF="2850"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to be the prize contested between him and the Austrian general. Yet, long before the approach of winter, one would imagine he must have been crushed between the shock of so many adverse hosts, had they been intent upon closing him in, and heartily concurred for his destruction: but, instead of urging the war with accumulated force, they acted in separate bodies, and with jealous eye seemed to regard the progress of each other. It was not therefore to any compunction, or kind forbearance in the court of Vienna, that the inacti∣vity of Daun was owing. The resentment of the house of Austria seemed, on the contrary, to glow with redoubled indignation, and the majority of the Germanic body seemed to enter with warmth into her quarrel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The obstinacy of the powers in opposition to Great Britain and Prussia, appeared still more remarkable in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ighting the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wing decla∣ration, which duke L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is of Brun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wic delivered to their ministers at the Hague, in the mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of December, after Quebec was reduced, and the fleet of France totally de∣feated.</P>

When the protestant states in arms against the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> court of Vienna were put under the ban of the Empire, the Evengelical Body, though without the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arret of the Evan∣gelical Body at Ratisbon.</NOTE> concurrence of the Swedish and Danisa ministers, issued an arret at Ratisbon in the mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h of No∣vember of the last year, and to this annexed the twentieth article of the capitulation signed by the Emperor at his election, in order to demonstrate, that the protestant states claimed nothing but what was agreeable to the constitution. They declared, that their association was no more than a mutual engagement, by which they obliged themselves to adhere to the laws, without suffering under any pretext, that the power of putting under the ban of the Empire, should reside wholly in the Em∣peror. They affirmed, that this power was re∣nounced, in express terms, by the capitulation: they therefore refused to admit, as legal, any sen∣tence of the ban, deficient in the requisite condi∣tions; and inferred, that, according to law, neither the elector of Brandenburg, nor the elector of Ha∣nover, nor the duke of Wolfembuttle, nor the langrave of Hesse, nor the count of Lippe Bucke∣burg, ought to be proscribed.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> former accession to the resolutions of the diet against the king of Prussia. This rescript having produced no effect, the arret was answered in Fe∣bruary by an Imperial decree of commission, car∣ried to the dictature, importing, that the Imperial court could not longer hesitate about the execution of the ban, without infringing that very article of the capitulation which they had specified: that the invalidity of the arret was manifest, inasmuch as the electors of Brandenburg and Brunswick, the dukes of Saxe Gotha and Brunswick Wolfenbuttle, and the landgrave of Hesse Cassel, were the very persons who disturbed the Empire: this, therefore being an affair in which they themselves were par∣ties, they could not possibly be qualified to concur in a resolution of this nature: besides, the number of the other states which had acceded was very in∣considerable: for these reasons, the Emperor could not but consider the resolution in question as an act whereby the general place of the Empire was dis∣turbed, both by the parties that had incurred the ban, and by the states which had joined them, in order to support and favour their frivolous preten∣sions. His Imperial majesty expressed his hope and confidence, that the other electors, princes, and states of the Empire, would vote the said resolu∣tion to be null, and of no force; and never suffer so small a number of states, who were adherents of and abettors to the disturbers of the Empire, to prejudice the rights and prerogatives of the whole Germanic body; to abuse the name of the asso∣ciated estates of the Augsbourg Confession, in or∣der forcibly to impose a <HI>factum,</HI> intirely repugnant to the constitution of the empire; to deprive their

Some of the springs of their national wealth were indeed ex∣hausted, or diverted into other channels: but the subjects declared for a continuation of the war, and the necessities of the state were supplied by the loyalty and attachment of the people.

In answer to this oration, the king assured them, that he had always regarded their High Mightinesses as his best friends. He said, if difficulties had arisen concerning trade, they ought to be considered as the consequences of a burthensome war which he was obliged to wage with France. He desired they would assure their High Mightinesses, that he should endeavour, on his part, to remove the obstacles in question; and expressed his satisfaction, that they (the deputies) were come over with the same disposition.</P>

They threatened and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> complained by turns, and eagerty seized all oppor∣tunities of displaying their partiality in favour of the enemies of Great Britain. In the month of September, major-general York, the British mi∣nister at the Hague, presented a memorial to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Memorial presented to the States General, by major-general Yorke.</NOTE> States General, remonstrating, that the merchants of Holland carried on a contraband trade in favour of France, by transporting cannon and warlike stores, from the Baltic to Holland, in Dutch bot∣toms, under the borrowed names of private per∣sons; and then conveying them by the inland ri∣vers and canals, or through the Dutch fortresses to Dunkirk and other places of France. He de∣sired that the king his master might be made easy on that head, by their putting an immediate stop to such practices, so repugnant to the connections subsisting by treaty, between Great Britain and the United Provinces, as well as to every idea of neu∣trality. He observed, that the attention which his majesty had lately given to their representations, against the excesses of the English privateers, by procuring an act of parliament, which laid them under proper restrictions, gave him a good title to the same regard on the part of their High Mightinesses. He reminded them that their trading towns felt the good effects of these restrictions; and that the freedom of navigation, which their subjects enjoyed amidst the troubles and distractions of Europe, had considerably augmented their com∣merce. He observed, that some return ought to be made to such solid proofs of the king's friend∣ship and moderation; at least, the merchants, who
<PB N="270" REF="2930"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1759.</NOTE> were so ready to complain of England, ought not to be countenanced in excesses which would have justified the most rigorous examination of their conduct. He recalled to their memories, that, during the course of the present war, the king had several times applied to their High Mightinesses, and to their ministers, on the liberty they had given to carry stores through the fortresses of the republic for the use of France, to invade the British dominions; and though his majesty had passed over in silence many of these instances of complaisance to his enemy, he was no less sensible of the injury; but he chose rather to be a suf∣ferer himself, than to encrease the embarrassment of his neighbours, or extend the flames of war. He took notice that even the court of Vienna had▪ upon more than one occasion, employed its interest with their High Mightinesses, and lent its name to obtain passes for warlike stores and provisions for the French troops, under colour of the Barrier Treaty, which it no longer observed: nay, after having put France in possession of Ostend and Nieuport, in manifest violation of that treaty, and without any regard to the rights which they and the king his master had acquired in that treaty, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the expence of so much blood and treasure.</P>

threats with his expostulation. He desired them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759▪</NOTE> to remember, that during the whole course of the war, the French king had required nothing from their friendship that was inconsistent with the strictest impartiality; and if he had deviated from the engagements subsisting between him and the republic, it was only by granting the most essential and lucrative favours to the subjects of their High Mightinesses. He observed that the English, not∣withstanding the insolence of their behaviour to the republic, had derived, on many occasions, assist∣ance from the protection their effects had found in the territories of the United Provinces: that the artillery, stores, and ammunition belonging to Wessel were deposited in their territories, which the Hanoverian army in passing the Rhine had very little respected: that when they repassed that river, they had no other way of saving their sick and wounded from the hands of the French, than by embarking them in boats, and conveying them to places where the French left them unmolested, actuated by their respect for the neutrality of the republic: that part of their magazines was still deposited in the towns of the United Provinces; where also the enemies of France had purchased and contracted for very considerable quantities of gunpowder. He told them, that tho' these and several other circumstances might have been made the subject of the justest complaints, the king of France did not think it proper to require that the freedom and independency of the subjects of the republic should be restrained in branches of com∣merce that were not inconsistent with its neutra∣lity,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> persuaded that the faith of an engagement ought to be inviolably preserved, though attended with some accidental and transient disadvantages; he gave them to understand, that the king his ma∣ster had ordered the generals of his army carefully to avoid encroaching on the territory of the re∣public, and transferring thither the theatre of the war, when his enemies retreated that way before they were forced to repass the Rhine. After such unquestionable marks of regard, he said, his king would have the justest ground of complaint, if, contrary to expectation, he should hear that the artillery and stores belonging to him were de∣tained at Amsterdam. Thirdly, he declared that such detention would be construed as a violation of the neutrality; and demanded, in the name of the king his master, that the artillery and stores should be, without delay, forwarded to Flan∣ders by the canals of Amsterdam and the inland navigation. This last argument was so conclusive, that they immediately granted the necessary pass∣ports, in consequence of which the cannon were conveyed to the Austrian Netherlands.</P>
<P>The powers in the southern parts of Europe were too much engrossed with their own concerns, to interest themselves deeply in the quarrels that distracted the German empire. The king of Spain, naturally of a melancholy complexion, and delicate constitution, was so deeply affected with the loss of his queen, who died in the course of the preceding year, that he renounced all company, neglected all business, and immured himself in a chamber at Villa Viciosa, where he gave a loose to the most
<PB N="273" REF="2960"/>
extravagant sorrow. He abstained from food and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> rest until his strength was quite exhausted. He would neither shift himself, nor allow his beard to be shaved: he rejected all attempts of consolation, and remained deaf to the most earnest and re∣spectful remonstrances of those who had a right to tender their advice. In this case, the affliction of the mind must have been reinforced by some pecu∣liarity in the constitution. He inherited a melan∣choly taint from his father, and this seems to have been dreaded as a family disease; for the infant Don Lewis, who likewise resided at the palace of Villa Viciosa, was fain to amuse himself with hunt∣ing, and other diversions, to prevent his being in∣fected with the king's disorder, which continued to gain ground, notwithstanding all the efforts of me∣dicine. The Spanish nation, naturally supersti∣tious, had recourse to saints and relicks; but they seemed insensible to their devotion. The king, however, in the midst of all his distress, was pre∣vailed upon to make his will, which was written by the count de Valparaiso, and signed by the duke of Bejar, high chancellor of the kingdom. The exorbitancy of his grief, and the mortifications he underwent, soon produced an incurable malady, under which he languished from the month of Sep∣tember in the preceding year, till the tenth of August in the present, when he expired. In his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the king of Spain.</NOTE> will he had appointed his brother Don Carlos, king of Naples, successor to the crown of Spain; and nominated the queen-dowager as a regent of the kingdom, until that prince should arrive.

The king of Naples had never acceded to this article, therefore he payed no regard to it on the death of his elder brother; but retained both kingdoms, without minding the claims of the Empress queen, who, he knew, was at that time in no condition to support her pretensions.

<PB N="276" REF="2990"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> That, according to the spirit of the treaties of this age, Europe required that the sovereignty of Spain should be separated from that of Italy, when such a separation could be effected without transgressing the rules of justice: that the unfortunate prince-royal having been destitute of reason and reflection ever since his infancy, and no hope remaining that he could ever acquire the use of these faculties, he could not think of appointing him to the succes∣sion, how agreeable soever such a disposition might be to nature and his paternal affection: he was therefore constrained, by the Divine Will, to set him aside, in favour of his third son Don Ferdi∣nand, whose minority obliged him to vest the ma∣nagement of these realms in a regency, which he accordingly appointed, after having previously de∣clared his son Ferdinand from that time emanci∣pated, and freed not only from all obedience to his paternal power, but even from all submission to his supreme and sovereign authority. He then de∣creed, that the minority of the princes succeeding to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, should expire with the fifteenth year of their age, when they should act as sovereigns, and have the intire power of the administration. He next established and ex¦plained the order of succession in the male and fe¦male line; on condition that the monarchy o Spain should never be united with the kingdom of the Two S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cilies. Finally, he transferred and made over to the said Don Ferdinand these king¦doms, with all that he possessed in Italy; and thi ordinance, signed and sealed by himself and the in fant Don Ferdinand, and counter-signed by th counsellors and secretary of state, in quality <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Don Carlos having taken these precautions for the benefit of his third son, whom he left king of Naples, embarked with the rest of his family on board a squadron of Spanish ships, who conveyed him to Barcelona. There he landed in the month of October, and proceeded to Madrid, where, as king of Spain, he was received amidst the accla∣mations of his people. He began his reign like a wise prince, by regulating the interior oeconomy of his kingdom; by pursuing the plan adopted by his predecessor; by retaining the ministry under whose auspices the happiness and commerce of his people had been extended; and with respect to the belligerant powers, by scrupulously adhering to that neutrality from whence these advantage were in a great measure derived.</P>

Among these were numbered some of the first noblemen of the kingdom, irritated by disappointed ambition, inflamed by bigotry, and exasperated by revenge. The principal conspirator, Don Joseph Mascarenhas and Lencastre, duke
<PB N="278" REF="3010"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of Aveiro, marquis of Torres Novas, and conde of Santa Cruz, was hereditary lord-steward of the king's houshold, and president of the palace-court, or last tribunal of appeal in the kingdom; so that he possessed the first office in the palace, and the second of the realm. Francisco de Assiz, marquis of Tavora, conde of St. John and Alvor, was gene∣ral of the horse, and head of the third noble house of the Tavoras, the most illustrious family in the kingdom, deriving their origin from the antient kings of Leon: he married his own kinswoman, who was marchioness of Tavora in her own right, and by this marriage acquired the marquisate. Louis Bernardo de Tavora was their eldest son, who, by virtue of a dispensation from the pope, had espoused his own aunt, Donna Theresa de Ta∣vora. Joseph Maria de Tavora, his youngest bro∣ther, was also involved in the guilt of his parents. The third principal concerned was Don Jeronymo de Attaide, conde of Attouguia, himself a relation and married to the eldest daughter of the marquis of Tavora. The characters of all those personages were unblemished and respectable, until this ma∣chination was detected. In the course of investi∣gating this dark affair, it appeared, that the duke de Aveiro had conceived a personal hatred to the king, who had disappointed him in a projected match between his son and a sister of the duke o Cadaval, a minor, and prevented his obtaining some commanderies which the late duke of Aveir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had possessed: that this nobleman, being deter¦mined to gratify his revenge against the person o his sovereign, had exerted all his art and address i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> securing the participation of the malcontents: that

with this view, he reconciled himself to the Jesuits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> with whom he had been formerly at variance, knowing they were at this time implacably in∣censed against the king, who had dismissed them from their office of penitentiaries at court, and branded them with other marks of disgrace, on ac∣count of their illegal and rebellious practices in South America: the duke, moreover, insinuated himself into the confidence of the marchioness of Tavora, notwithstanding an inveterate rivalship of pride and ambition, which had long subsisted be∣tween the two families. Her resentment against the king was inflamed by the mortification of her pride in repeated repulses, when she sollicited the title of duke for her husband. Her passions were artfully fomented and managed by the Jesuits, to whom she had resigned the government of her con∣science; and they are said to have persuaded her, that it would be a meritorious action to take away the life of a prince who was an enemy to the church, and a tyrant to his people. She, being re∣conciled to the scheme of assassination, exerted her influence in such a manner as to inveigle her hus∣band, her sons, and son-in-law, into the same in∣famous design; and yet this lady had been always remarkable for her piety, affability, and sweetness of disposition. Many consultations were held by the conspirators at the colleges of the Jesuits, St. Antao and St. Roque, as well as at the houses of the duke and the marquis. At last they resolved, that the king should be assassinated; and employed two russians, called Antonio Alvarez and Joseph Policarpio, for the execution of this design, the mis∣carriage
<PB N="280" REF="3030"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of which we have related among the trans∣actions of the preceding year.</P>
<P>In the beginning of January, before the circum∣stances of the conspiracy were known, the counts de Oberos and de Rebeira Grande were imprisoned in the castle of St. Julian, on a suspicion arising from their freedom of speech. The dutchess of Aveiro, the countess of Attouguia, and the mar∣chioness of Alorna, with their children, were sent to different nunneries; and eight Jesuits were taken into custody. A council being appointed for the trial of the prisoners, the particulars we have related were brought to light by the torture; and sentence of death was pronounced and executed upon the convicted criminals. Eight wheels were fixed upon a scaffold, raised in the square opposite to the house where the prisoners had been con∣fined, and the thirteenth of January was fixed for the day of execution. Antonio Alvarez Ferreira, one of the assassins who had fired into the king's equipage, was fixed to a stake at one corner of the scaffold; and at the other was placed the effigies of his accomplice, Joseph Policarpio de Azevedo, who had made his escape. The marchioness of Tavora, being brought upon the scaffold between eight and nine in the morning, was beheaded at one stroke, and then covered with a linnen cloth. Her two sons, and her son-in-law the count of At∣touguia, with three servants of the duke de Aveiro, were first strangled at one stake, and afterwards broke upon wheels, where their bodies remained covered: but the duke and the marquis, as chiefs of the conspiracy, were broke alive, and under∣went the most excruciating torments. The last
<PB N="281" REF="3040"/>
that suffered was the assassin Alvarez, who being<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> condemned to be burnt alive, the combustibles, which had been placed under the scaffold, were set on fire, the whole machine with their bodies con∣sumed to ashes, and these ashes thrown into the sea. The estates of the three unfortunate noble∣men were confiscated, and their dwelling-houses razed to the ground. The name of Tavora was suppressed for ever by a public decree; but that of Mascarenha spared, because the duke de Aveiro was a younger branch of the family. A reward of ten thousand crowns was offered to any person who should apprehend the assassin who had escaped: then the embargo was taken off the shipping. The king and royal family assisted at a public Te Deum, sung in the chapel of Nossa Senhora de Livramen∣to; on which occasion the king, for the satisfac∣tion of his people, waved his handkerchief with both hands, to shew he was not maimed by the wounds he had received. If such an attempt upon the life of a king was infamously cruel and perfi∣dious, it must be owned, that the punishment in∣flicted upon the criminals was horrible to human nature. The attempt itself was attended with some circumstances that might have staggered belief, had it not appeared but too plain that the king was actually wounded. One would imagine, that the duke de Aveiro, who was charged with designs on the crown, should have made some prepara∣tions for taking advantage of the confusion and disorder which must have been produced by the king's assassination; but we do not find that any thing of this nature was premeditated. It was no more than a desperate scheme of personal revenge,
<PB N="282" REF="3050"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> conceived without caution, and executed without conduct: a circumstance the more extraordinary, if we suppose the conspirators were actuated by the counsels of the Jesuits, who have been ever fa∣mous for finesse and dexterity. Besides, the dis∣covery of all the particulars was founded upon con∣fession extorted by the rack, which, at best, is a suspicious evidence. Be that as it will, the Portu∣guese government, without waiting for a bull from the pope, sequestered all the estates and effects of the Jesuits in that kingdom, which amounted to considerable su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and reduced the individuals of the society to a very canty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wance.

In the mean time, the court of Lisbon ordered a considerable number of them to be embarked for Italy, and re∣solved that no Jesuit should hereafter reside with∣in its realms. When these transports arrived at Civita Vecchia. they were▪ by the pope's order, lodged in the Dominican and Capuchin convents of that city, until proper houses could be prepared for their reception at Tivoli and Frescati. The most guilty of them, however, were detained in close p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isonin Portugal, reserved, in all probability, for a punishment more adequate to their enormi∣ties.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ses∣sion of parlia∣ment opened by com∣mission.</NOTE> England still continued to enjoy the blessings of peace, even amidst the triumphs of war. In the month of November the session of parliament was opened by commission; and, the commons attend∣ing in the house of peers, the lord-keeper ha∣rangued the parliament to this effect: he gave
<PB N="283" REF="3060"/>
them to understand, that his majesty had directed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> him to assure them, that he thought himself pecu∣liarly happy in being able to convoke them in a situation of affairs so glorious to his crown, and ad∣vantageous to his kingdoms: that the king saw and devoutly adored the hand of Providence, in the many signal successes, both by sea and land, with which his arms had been blessed in the course of the last campaign: that he reflected with great satisfaction on the confidence which the parliament had placed in him, by making such ample provi∣sions, and intrusting him with such extensive pow∣ers, for carrying on a war which the defence of their valuable rights and possessions, together with the preservation of the commerce of his people, had rendered both just and necessary. He enume∣rated the late successes of the British arms, the re∣duction of Goree on the coast of Africa, the con∣quest of so many important places in America, the defeat of the French army in Canada, the reduction of their capital city Quebec, effected with so much honour to the courage and conduct of his majesty's officers and forces, the important advantage ob∣tained by the British squadron off Cape Lagos, and the effectual blocking up for so many months the principal part of the French navy in their own harbours: events which must have filled the hearts of all his majesty's faithful subjects with the sincerest joy; and convinced his parliament, that there had been no want of vigilance or vigour on his part, in exerting those means which they with so much prudence and public-spirited zeal had put into his majesty's hands. He observed, that the national advantages had extended even as far as

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the East Indies, where, by the Divine Blessing, the dangerous designs of his majesty's enemies had miscarried, and that valuable branch of commerce had received great benefit and protection. That the memorable victory gained over the French at Minden, had long made a deep impression on the minds of his majesty's people: that if the crisis in which the battle was fought, the superior number of the enemy, the great and able conduct of his majesty's general, prince Ferdinand of Brunswic, were considered, that action must be the subject of lasting admiration and thankfulness: that if any thing could fill the breasts of his majesty's good subjects with still farther degrees of exultation, it would be the distinguished and unbroken valour of the British troops, owned and applauded by those whom they overcame. He said, the glory they had gained was not merely their own, but, in a national view, was one of the most important cir∣cumstances of our success, as it must be a striking admonition to our enemies with whom they have to contend. He told them, that his majesty's good brother and ally the king of Prussia, attacked and surrounded by so many considerable powers, had by his magnanimity and abilities, and the bravery of his troops, been able, in a surprising manner, to prevent the mischiefs concerted with such united force against him. He declared, by the command of his sovereign, that as his majesty entered into this war not from views of ambition, so he did not wish to continue it from motives of resentment: that the desire of his majesty's heart was to see a stop put to the effusion of Christian blood: that, whenever such terms of peace could be established,
<PB N="285" REF="3080"/>
as should be just and honourable for his majesty<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and his allies; and by procuring such advantages as, from the successes of his majesty's arms, might in reason and equity be expected, should bring along with them full security for the future, his majesty would rejoice to see the repose of Europe restored on such solid and durable foundations; and his faithful subjects, to whose liberal support and unshaken firmness his majesty owed so much, hap∣py in the enjoyment of the blessings of peace and tranquillity: but, in order to this great and desire∣able end, he said his majesty was confident the par∣liament would agree with him, that it was neces∣sary to make ample provision for carrying on the war, in all parts, with the utmost vigour. He as∣sured the commons, that the great supplies they had granted in the last session of parliament, had been faithfully employed for the purposes for which they were granted; but the uncommon extent of the war, and the various services necessary to be pro∣vided for, in order to secure success to his majesty's measures, had unavoidably occasioned extraordi∣nary expences. Finally, he repeated the assurances from the throne of the high satisfaction his majesty took in that union and good harmony, which was so conspicuous among his good subjects: he said, his sovereign was happy in seeing it continued and confirmed: he observed, that experience had shewn how much the nation owed to this union, which alone could secure the true happiness of his people.</P>

The houses, in their respective ad∣dresses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Substance of the ad∣dresses.</NOTE> seemed to vie with each other in expressions of attachment and complacency. The peers pro∣fessed their utmost readiness to concur in the ef∣fectual support of such further measures as his majesty, in his <HI>great wisdom,</HI> should judge necessary or expedient for carrying on the war with vigour in all parts, and for disappointing and repelling any desperate attempts which might be made upon these kingdoms. The commons expressed their admiration of that true greatness of mind, which disposed his majesty's heart, in the midst of pros∣perities, to wish a stop put to the effusion of Chris∣tian blood, and to see tranquillity restored. They declared their entire reliance on his majesty's known wisdom and firmness, that this desireable object, whenever it should be obtained, would be upon terms just and honourable for his majesty and his allies; and, in order to effect that great end, they assured him they would chearfully grant such sup∣plies as should be found necessary to sustain, and press with effect, all his extensive operations against the enemy. They did not fail to re-eccho the speech as usual, enumerating the trophies of the year, and extolling the king of Prussia for his con∣summate genius, magnanimity, unwearied activity, and unshaken constancy of mind.</P>
<P>Very great reason, indeed, had his majesty to be satisfied with an address of such a nature from an house of commons, in which opposition lay stran∣gled at the foot of the minister; in which those de∣magogues, who had raised themselves to reputation and renown, by declaiming against continental

measures, were become so persectly reconciled to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the object of their former reprobation, as to culti∣vate it even with a degree of enthusiasm, unknown to any former administration, and lay the nation under such contributions in its behalf, as no other m—y durst ever meditate. Thus disposed, it was no wonder they admired the moderation of their sovereign, in offering to treat of peace, after above a million of men had perished by the war, and twice that number been reduced to misery; after whole provinces had been depopulated, whole coun∣tries subdued, and the victors themselves almost crushed by the trophies they had gained.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Supplies granted for the expence of the year 1760.</NOTE> Immediately after the addresses were presented, the commons resolved themselves into a committee of the whole house, and having unanimously voted a supply to his majesty, began to take the particu∣lars into consideration.

For the service of the ensuing year they voted seventy thousand seamen, including eighteen thousand three hundred and fifty five marines; and for their maintenance al∣lotted three millions six hundred and forty thou∣sand pounds.

Towards paying off the navy debt, buildings, rebuildings, and repairs of the king's ships, together with the charge of transport∣service, they granted one million seven hundred and one thousand seventy-eight pounds sixteen shillings and six pence. For defraying the extra∣ordinary expences of the land-forces, and other ser∣vices not provided for by parliament, comprehend∣ing the pensions for the widows of reduced offi∣cers, they allotted the sum of nine hundred fifty-five thousand three hundred and forty-four pounds fifteen shillings and five pence half penny. They voted one million, to impower his majesty to dis∣charge the like sum, raised in pursuance of an act made in the lact session of parliament, and charged upon the first aids or supplies to be granted in this session of parliament. They gave six hundred and seventy thousand pounds for enabling his majesty to make good his engagements with the king of Prussia, pursuant to a new convention between him and that monarch, concluded on the ninth day of November in the present year. Fifteen thousand pounds they allowed, upon account, towards en∣abling the principal officers of his Majesty's ordi∣nance to defray the necessary charges and expences of taking down and removing the present maga∣zine for gunpowder, situated in the neighbourhood of Greenwich, and of erecting it in some less dan∣gerous situation.

Five hundred thousand pounds they voted, upon ac∣count, as a present supply towards defraying the charges of forage, bread, bread waggons, train of artillery, wood, straw, provisions, and contingen∣eies of his majesty's combined army under the command of prince Ferdinand. To the Foundling∣hospital they granted five thousand pounds: and fifteen thousand for improving, widening, and en∣larging the passage over and through London-bridge. To replace divers sums taken from the sinking-fund, they granted two hundred twenty-five thousand two hundred and eighty-one pounds nineteen shillings and four pence. For the sub∣sistence of reduced officers, including the allow∣ances to the several officers and private men of the two troops of horse-guards and regiment of horse reduced, and to the superannuated gentlemen of the four troops of horse-guards, they voted thirty-eight thousand five hundred and ninety-seven pounds nine shillings. Upon account, for the sup∣port of the colonies of Nova Scotia and Georgia, they granted twenty-one thousand six hundred ninety-four pounds two shillings and two pence.

The East India company they gratified with twenty thousand pounds towards enabling them to defray the ex∣pence of a military force in their settlements, in lieu of a battalion of the king's troops now re∣turned to Ireland. Twenty-five thousand pounds were provided for the payment of the out-pen∣sioners of Chelsea-hospital. For subsequent aug∣mentations of the British sorces, since the first esti∣mate of guards and garrisons for the ensuing year was presented, they allowed one hundred thirty-four thousand one hundred thirty-nine pounds seventeen shillings and four pence.

For the maintenance and augmentation of the troops of Brunswic, in the pay of Great Britain, for the ensuing year, pursuant to an ulterior convention concluded and signed at Paderborn on the fifth day of March, in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and sixty, they granted the sum of ninety thousand seven hundred and sixty-nine pounds eight shillings and eleven pence farthing; and for the troops of Hesse-Cassel in the same pay, during the same period, they allotted one hundred and one thousand ninety-six pounds three shillings and two pence. For the extroardinary expences of the land-forces, and other services incurred, from the twenty-fourth day of November in the present year, to the twenty-fourth of December following, and not provided for, they granted the sum of four hundred twenty thousand one hundred and twenty pounds one shilling. To make good the deficiency of the grants for the service of this present year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine, they as∣signed the sum of seventy-five thousand one hun∣dred and seventy pounds three pence farthing.

For defraying the extroardinary charge of the mint, during the present year, they allowed eleven thou∣sand nine hundred and forty pounds thirteen shil∣lings and ten pence; and two thousand five hun∣dred pounds, upon account, for paying the debts claimed and sustained upon a forfeited estate in North Britain. They likewise allowed twelve thousand eight hundred and seventy-four pounds fifteen shillings and ten pence, for defraying the charge of a regiment of light dragoons, and of an additional company to the corps commanded by lieutenant colonel Vaughan. Finally, they voted one million, upon account, to enable the king to defray any extraordinary expences of the war, in∣curred or to be incurred for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty; and to take all such measures as might be necessary to defeat any enterprize or designs of his enemies, as the exigency of affairs might require.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflecti∣ons on the sup∣ply.</NOTE> On the whole, the sum total granted in this ses∣sion of parliament, amounted to fifteen millions five hundred three thousand five hundred and sixty-three pounds fifteen shillings and nine pence half∣penny
<PB N="294" REF="3170"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> a sum so enormous, whether we consider the nation that raised it, or the purposes for which it was raised, that every Briton of a sedate mind, attached to the interest and welfare of his country, must reflect upon it with equal astonishment and concern: a sem considerably more than double the largest subsidy that was granted in the reign of queen Anne, when the nation was in the zenith of her glory, and retained half the powers of Europe in her pay: a sum almost double of what any for∣mer administration durst have asked; and near double of what the most sanguine calculators who lived in the beginning of this century, thought the nation could give without the most imminent ha∣zard of immediate bankruptcy. Of the immense supply, which we have particularised, the reader will perceive that two millions three hundred forty-four thousand four hundred and eighty-six pounds sixteen shillings and seven pence three farthings were paid to foreigners for supporting the war in Germany, exclusive of the money expended by the British troops in that country; the number of which amounted in the course of the ensuing year to twenty thousand men; a number the more ex∣traordinary, if we consider they were all trans∣ported to that continent during the ad—n of those who declared in p—(the words still sound∣ing in our ears) that not a man, not even half a man, should be sent from G—B—to G—y, to fight the battles of any foreign e—r.

To the German war we may also impute the extraordinary expence in∣curred by the actual service of the militia, which the absence of the regular troops renders in a great measure necessary; and the loss of so many hands withdrawn from industry, from husbandry, and manufacture. The loss sustained by this connexion is equally grievous and apparent; the advantage accruing from it, either to Britain or Hanover, we have not dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernment sufficient to perceive, con∣sequently cannot be supposed able to explain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways and means, annuities, and a lot∣tery.</NOTE> The committee of ways and means, having duly deliberated on the articles of supply, conti∣nued sitting from the▪ twenty-second day of No∣vember to the fourteenth of May, during which period they established the necessary funds to pro∣duce the sums which had been granted. The land tax at four shillings in the pound, and the malt tax, were continued, as the standing revenue of Great Britain. They resolved that the sum of eight millions should be raised by transferable an∣nuities, after the rate of four pounds per centum; that an additional capital of three pounds should be added to every hundred pounds advanced, to con∣sist of a lottery-ticket valued at three pounds, to be attended also with transferable annuities, after the rate of four per centum per annum, to com∣mence from the fifth day of January in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-one, to con∣tinue for twenty years, and then be reduced to three pounds per centum per annum; and that the said sum of eight millions should bear the same

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Additio∣nal malt tax.</NOTE> The next fund proposed was a new tax upon malt, with respect to which, the committee resol∣ved, That an additonal tax of three pence should be paid for every bushel of malt made in England and Wales; and three half-pence for every bushel made in Scotland▪ and so proportionably for any greater or lesser quantity, to be paid by the makers thereof: that three half-pence should be paid for every bushel of malt conveyed from Scotland to England and Wales; and that the aforementioned annuitites and lottery should be charged upon the said duties on malt, for which the sinking fund

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> should be the collateral security. Touching the same imposition they resolved, that this new duty should, both in England and Scotland, be paid for every bushel of malt, whether ground or un∣ground, which, having been made before the com∣mencement of these additional duties, should, on or after the said day of commencement, be in the possession of any maltster, or maker of malt, for sale, seller or retailer of malt, brewer, distiller, inn∣keeper, victualler, vinegar-maker, or any person or persons in trust for them, or for their use: that the monies arising by the said duties should be carried to, and made part of the fund for payment of the annuities and lottery, allowing the sum of eight millions granted to his majesty in the present ses∣sion of parliament.</P>

That, in order to encourage the exporta∣tion of spirits drawn or made in Great Britain, the like drawbacks and allowances should be made, under proper regulations, upon the exportation of rectified spirits made or drawn in Great Britain, as are now payable upon the exportation of home∣made raw spirits; and that, as a further encourage∣ment, an additional drawback or allowance of twenty-four pounds ten shillings per ton should be paid, upon the exportation of all such spirits: that an additional duty of one shilling for every gallon of single brandy, spirits, or aqua vitae, im∣ported

That all duties charged upon rum or spirits of the growth, produce, and manufacture of his majesty's sugar-plantations, imported into Great Britain, should be drawn back upon the re-expor∣tation; and that an additional drawback or allow∣ance of three pounds three shillings per ton, should be paid upon the exportation of spirits drawn in Great Britain from molasses, over and above all other drawbacks and allowances payable thereon. They resolved to continue in force several acts and clauses relating to the jurisdiction, powers, and au∣thorities vested in commissioners for licensing hack∣ney chairs and coaches; and agreed, that the act for making sail-cloth, now near expiring, should be protracted. They resolved, that for raising the sum of one million, granted to his majesty towards discharging the debt of the navy, and also the sum of five hundred thousand pounds in part of the supply granted for naval services, the said sum of fifteen hundred thousand pounds should be raised by loans, or Exchequer bills, to be charged upon the first aids to be granted in the next session of

This excess, however, will not appear extraordi∣nary, when we consider, that it was destined to make good the premium of two hundred and forty thousand pounds to the subscribers upon the eight million loan, as well as the deficiencies in the other grants, which never fail to make a considerable article in the supply of every session. That these gignantic strides towards the r—of p—c c—t were such as might alarm every well-wisher to his coun∣try, will perhaps more plainly appear in the sum

total of the national debt, which, including the in∣cumbrance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of one million charged upon the civil list revenue, and provided for by a tax upon sala∣ries and pensions, payable out of that revenue, amounted, at this period, to the tremendous sum of one hundred eight millions four hundred ninety-three thousand one hundred fifty▪four pounds four∣teen shillings and eleven pence one farthing.

While the house of commons deliberated on the bill for grant∣ing to his majesty several duties upon malt, and for raising a certain sum of money to be charged on the said duties, a petition was presented by the maltsters of Ipswich and parts adjacent, against an additional duty on the stock of malt in hand: but no regard was paid to this remonstrance; and the bill, with several new amendments, passed through both houses under the title of "An act for granting to his majesty several duties upon malt, and for raising the sum of eight millions by way of annuities and a lottery, to be charged on

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three other bills relating to the sup∣ply.</NOTE> The other three bills, that turned wholly on the supply, were passed in common course, without the least opposition in either house, and received the royal assent by commission at the end of the session.

The second, granting to his majesty a certain sum of money out of the sinking fund, for the service of the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty, comprehended a clause of credit for borrowing the money thereby granted; and another clause impowering the bank to lend it without any limitation of interest; and the third, enabling his majesty to raise a certain sum of money towards discharging the debt of the navy, and for naval services during the ensuing year, enacted, that the Exchequer bills thereby to be issued, should not be received, or pass to any re∣ceiver or collector of the public revenue, or at the receipt of the Exchequer, before the twenty-sixth day of March in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and sixty-one.</P>

A great many accounts being perused, and witnesses exa¦mined, relating to the distillery, a bill was brough in to prevent the excessive use of spirituous liquors by laying an additional duty thereupon; and to encourage the exportation of British made spirits Considerable opposition was made to the bill, or
<PB N="307" REF="3300"/>
the opinion that the additional duty proposed was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> too small; and that, among the resolutions, there was not so much as one that looked like a provision or restriction for preventing the pernicious abuse of such liquors. Nay, many persons affirmed, that what was proposed looked more like a scheme for increasing the public revenue, than a salutary mea∣sure to prevent excess. The merchants and manu∣facturers of the town of Birmingham petitioned for such restrictions. The lord mayor, aldermen, and common council of London, presented a peti∣tion by the hands of the two sheriffs, setting forth, that the petitioners had, with great pleasure, ob∣served the happy consequences produced upon the morals, behaviour, industry, and health of the lower class of people, since the prohibition of the malt-distillery: that the petitioners, having ob∣served a bill was brought in to allow the distilling of spirits from corn, were apprehensive that the encouragement given to the distillers thereof would prove detrimental to the commercial interest of the nation; and, they conceived, the advantages pro∣posed to be allowed upon the exportation of such spirits, being so much above the value of the com∣modity, would lay such a temptation for smuggling and perjury as no law could prevent. They ex∣pressed their fears, that, should such a bill pass into a law, the excessive use of spirituous liquors would not only debiliate and enervate the labourers, ma∣nufacturers, sailors, soldiers, and all the lower class of people, and thereby extinguish industry, and that remarkable intrepidity which had lately so emi∣nently appeared in the British nation, which must always depend on the vigour and industry of its

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> people; but also its liberty and happiness, which can∣not be supported without temperance and morali∣ty, would run the utmost risque of being destroyed. They declared themselves also apprehensive, that the extraordinary consumption of bread-corn by the still, would not only raise the price so as to op∣press the lower class of people; but would raise such a bar to the exportation thereof, as to deprive the nation of a great influx of money, at that time essential towards the maintaining of an expensive war, and therefore highly injure the landed and commercial interest: they therefore prayed, that the present prohibition of distilling spirits from corn might be continued, or that the use of wheat might not be allowed in distillation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The bill amerded and pass∣ed.</NOTE> This remonstrance was corroborated by another, to the same purpose, from several merchants, ma∣nufacturers, and traders, residing in and near the city of London; and seemed to have some weight with the commons, who made several amendments to the bill, which they now intitled, "A bill for preventing the excessive use of spirituous liquors, by laying additional duties thereon; for shortening the prohibition for making low wines and spirits from wheat; for encouraging the exportation of British made spirits, and preventing the fraudulent relanding or importation thereof <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Abstract of the Act la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly passed for preventing the ex∣cessive Use of <HI>Spirituous Li∣quors</HI> by laying <HI>additional Duties</HI> thereon, &amp;c.</P>

<PB N="311" REF="3340"/>
The best way of preventing the excess<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of spirituous liquors, would be to lower the excise
<PB N="312" REF="3350"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> on beer and ale, so as to enable the poorer class of labourers to refresh themselves with a comfortable liquor, for nearly the same expence that will pro∣cure a quantity of geneva sufficient for intoxica∣tion; for it cannot be supposed that a poor wretch will expend his last penny upon a draught of small beer, without strength or the least satisfactory ope∣ration, when for the half of that sum he can pur∣chase a cordial, that will almost instantaneously allay the sense of hunger and cold, and regale his imagination with the most agreeable illusions. Malt is now sold cheaper than it was in the first year of king James I. when the parliament enacted, that no inn-keeper, victualler, or alehouse-keeper, should sell less than a full quart of the best ale or beer, or two quarts of the small, for one penny, under the penalty of twenty shillings. It appears, then, that in the reign of James the subject payed but four pence for a gallon of strong beer, which now costs a shilling; and as the malt is not encreased in value, the difference in the price must be intirely owing to the taxes on beer, malt, and hops, which are in∣deed very grievous, though perhaps necessary. The duty on small beer is certainly one of the heaviest taxes imposed upon any sort of consump∣tion, that cannot be considered as an article of
<PB N="313" REF="3360"/>
luxury. Two bushels of malt, and two pounds of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> hops, are required to make a barrel of good small beer, which was formerly sold for six shillings; and the taxes payable on such a barrel amounted to three shillings and six pence; so that the sum total of the imposition, on this commodity, was equal to a land-tax of eleven shillings and eight pence in the pound.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill con∣tinuing the per∣mission to import Irish bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Immediately after the resolution relating to the prohibition of spirits from wheat, a motion was made, and leave given, to bring in a bill to con∣tinue, for a time limited, the act of the last session permitting the importation of salted beef from Ire∣land. This permission was accordingly extended to the twenty-fourth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-one. In all probability this short and temporary continuance was proposed by the favourers of the bill, in order to avoid the clamour and opposition of prejudice and ignorance, which would have been dangerously alarmed, had it been rendered perpetual. Yet, as undoubted evidence had proved before the com∣mittee, while the bill was depending, that the im∣portation had been of great service to England, particularly in reducing the price of salted beef for the use of the navy, perhaps no consideration ought to have prevented the legislature from per∣petuating the law; a measure that would encourage the graziers of Ireland to breed and fatten horned cattle, and certainly put a stop to the practice of exporting salted beef from that kingdom to France, which undoubtedly furnishes the traders of that kingdom with opportunities of exporting wool to the same country.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759. Bill to quicken the exe∣cution of the laws relating to the mi∣litia.</NOTE> As several lieutenants of counties had, for va∣rious reasons, suspended all proceedings in the exe∣cution of the laws relating to the militia for limited times, which suspensions were deemed inconsistent with the intent of the legislature, a bill was now brought in to enable his majesty's lieutenants of the several counties of England and Wales to pro∣ceed in the execution of the militia laws, notwith∣standing any adjournments. It was enacted, that, as the speedy execution of the laws for regulating the militia was most essentially necessary at this juncture to the peace and security of the kingdom, every lieutenant of the place where such suspension had happened, should, within one month after the passing of this act, proceed as if there had been no such suspension; and summon a meeting for the same purpose once in every succeeding month, until a sufficient number of officers, qualified and willing to serve, should be found, or until the ex∣piration of the act for the better ordering the mi∣litia forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt to esta∣blish a militia in South Britain.</NOTE> The establishment of a regular militia in South Britain could not fail to make an impression upon the patriots of Scotland. They were convinced, from reason and experience, that nothing could more tend to the peace and security of their coun∣try than such an establishment in North Britain, the inhabitants of which had been peculiarly ex∣posed to insurrections, which a well-regulated mili∣tia might have prevented, or stifled in the birth; and their coast had been lately alarmed by a threatened invasion, which nothing but the want of such an establishment had rendered formidable to the natives. They thought themselves intitled to
<PB N="315" REF="3380"/>
the same security which the legislature had pro∣vided<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> for their fellow-subjects in South▪Britain; and could not help being uneasy at the prospect of seeing themselves left unarmed and exposed to in∣juries, both foreign and domestic, while the sword was put into the hands of their southern neigh∣bours. Some of the members, who represented North Britain in parliament, moved by these consi∣derations, as well as by the earnest injunctions of their constituents, resolved to make a vigorous ef∣fort, in order to obtain the establishment of a re∣gular militia in Scotland. In the beginning of March it was moved, and resolved, that the house would, on the twelfth day of the month, resolve it∣self into a committee, to consider of the laws in being which relate to the militia in that part of Great Britain called Scotland. The result of that inquiry was, that these laws were ineffectual.</P>
<P>Then a motion was made for leave to bring in a bill for the better ordering of the militia forces in North Britain; and though it met with great op∣position, was carried by a large majority. The principal Scottish members of the house were ap∣pointed, in conjunction with others, to prepare the bill, which was soon printed, and reinforced by petitions presented by the gentlemen, justices of the peace, and commissioners of the supply for the shire of Ayr; and by the freeholders of the shires of Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, and Forfar. They expressed their approbation of the established militia in England; and their ardent wish to see the benefit of that wise and salutary measure ex∣tended to North Britain. This was an indulgence
<PB N="316" REF="3390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> they had the greater reason to hope for, as by the articles of the Union they were undoubtedly in titled to be on the same footing with their brethre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of England, and as the legislature must now be convinced of the necessity of some such measure by the consternation lately produced in their de fenceless country, from the threatened invasion of a handful of French freebooters. These remon¦strances had no weight with the majority in the house of commons, who, either unable, or un¦willing to make proper distinctions between the ill and well affected subjects of North Britain, rejected the bill, as a very dangerous experiment in favour of a people among whom so many rebellions had been generated and produced. When the motion was made for the bill's being committed, a warm debate ensued, in the course of which, many Scot∣tish members spoke in behalf of their country, with great force of argument, and a very laudable spirit of freedom. Mr. Elliot, in particular, one of the com∣missioners of the board of admiralty, distinguished himself by a noble flow of eloquence, adorned with all the graces of oratory, and warmed with the true spirit of patriotism. Mr. Oswald of the trea∣sury acquited himself with great honour on the occasion; every nervous, steady and sagacious, independent though in office, and invariable in pursuing the true interest of his country. It must be owned, for the honour of North Britain, that all her representatives, except two, warmly con∣tended for this national measure, which was car∣ried in the negative by a majority of one hundred and six, though the bill was exactly modelled by
<PB N="317" REF="3400"/>
the late act of parliament for the establishment of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the militia in England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Further regula∣tions re∣lating to the mili∣tia of South Britain.</NOTE> Even this institution, though certainly laudable and necessary, was attended with so many unfore∣seen difficulties, that every session of parliament since it was first established, has produced new acts for its better regulation. In April, leave was given to prepare a bill for limiting, confining, and better regulating, the payment of the weekly al∣lowances made by act of parliament, for the main∣tenance of families unable to support themselves during the absence of militia men embodied and ordered out into actual service; as well as for amending and improving the establishment of the militia, and lessening the number of officers in∣titled to pay, within that part of Great Britain called England. While this bill was under consi∣deration, the house received a petition from the mayor, aldermen, town-clerk, sheriffs, gentlemen, merchants, clergy, tradesmen and others, inhabi∣tants of the ancient city of Lincoln, representing, That by an act passed relating to the militia, it was provided that when any militia-men should be or∣dered out into actual service, leaving families un∣able to support themselves during their absence, the overseers of the parish where such families re∣side, should allow them such weekly support, as should be prescribed by any one justice of the peace, which allowance should be reimbursed out of the county stock. They alledged, that a considerable number of men, inhabitants of the said city, had entered themselves to serve in the militia of the county of Lincoln, as volunteers, for several pa∣rishes
<PB N="318" REF="3410"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and persons; yet their families were, never∣theless, supported by the county stock of the city and county of the city of Lincoln. They took no∣tice of the bill under deliberation, and prayed, that if it should pass into a law, they might have such relief in the premises, as to the house should seem meet. Regard was had to this petition in the amend∣ments to the bill <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this law it was enacted, that if any militia man who shall have been accepted and enrolled as a substitute, hired man, or volunteer, before the passing of the act, or who shall have been chosen by lot, whether before or after the passing of the act, shall, when embodied, or called out into actual service, and ordered to march, leave a family unable to support themselves, the overseers shall, by order of some one justice of the peace, pay, out of the poor's rates of such parish, a weekly al∣lowance to such family, ac∣cording to the usual and or∣dinary price of labour and husbandry there; viz. for one child under the age of ten years, the price of one day's labour; for two children un∣der the age aforesaid, the price of two days labour; for three or four children under the age aforesaid, the prince of three days labour; for five or more children under the age aforesaid, the price of four days labour; and for the wife of such militia man, the price of one day's labour; but that the families of such men only as shall be chosen by lot, and of the substitutes, hired men and volunteers, already accepted and enrolled, shall, after the passing of this act, receive any such weekly allowance. For removing the grievance complained of in the above petition, it is en∣acted, that where treasurers shall reimburse to overseers any money, in pursuance of this act on account of the weekly allowance to the fa∣mily of any militia man, serv∣ing in the militia of any county or place, other than that wherein such family shall dwell, they are to transmit an account thereof, signed by some justice, for the place where such family shall dwell, to the treasurer of the county, &amp;c. in the militia whereof such militia man shall serve, who is thereupon to pay him the sums so reimbursed to such overseers, and the same to be allowed in his accounts.</NOTE>, which passed through both
<PB N="319" REF="3420"/>
houses, and received the royal assent by commission.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> During the dependance of this bill, another was brought in to explain so much of the militia act passed in the thirty-first year of his majesty's reign, as related to the money to be given to private mi∣litia-men, upon their being ordered out into actual service. By this law it was enacted, that the guinea which by the former act was due to every private man of every regiment or company of mi∣litia, when ordered out into actual service, should be payed to every man that shall afterwards be en∣rolled into such regiment or company whilst in ac∣tual service: that no man should be intitled to his cloaths for his own use, until he should have ser∣ved three years, if unembodied, or one year, if embodied, after the delivery of the cloaths; and that the full pay of the militia should commence from the date of his majesty's warrant for drawing them out. The difficulties which these successive regulations were made to obviate, will be amply recompenced by the good effects of a national mi∣litia, provided it be employed in a national way, and for national purposes: but if the militia are embodied, and the different regiments that com∣pose it are marched from the respective counties to which they belong; if the men are detained for any length of time, in actual service, at a distance from their families, when they might be employed at home in works of industry, for the support of their natural dependants; the militia becomes no other than an addition to, or augmentation of a standing army enlisted for the term of three years. The labour of the men is lost to the community; they contract the idle habits and dissolute man∣ners
<PB N="320" REF="3430"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> of the other troops; their families are left as incumbrances on the community; and the charge of their subsistence, is, at least, as heavy as that of maintaining an equal number of regular forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflecti∣ons on that in∣stitution.</NOTE> It would not, we apprehend, be very easy to account for the g—t's ordering the regi∣ments of militia to march from their respective counties, and do duty for a considerable length of time, at a great distance from their own homes; unless we suppose this measure was taken to create in the people a disgust to the institution of the mi∣litia, which was an establishment extorted from the s—by the voice of the nation. We may add, that some of the inconveniencies attending a militia, will never be totally removed, while the persons drawn by lot for that service are at liberty to hire substitutes; for it cannot be supposed, that men of substance will incur the danger, fatigue, and damage of serving in person, while they can hire among the lowest class of people, mercenaries of desperate fortune and abandoned morals, who will greedily seize the opportunity of being payed for renouncing that labour by which they were be∣fore obliged to maintain themselves and their fa∣mily connexions: it would therefore deserve the consideration of the legislature, whether the pri∣vilege of hiring substitutes should not be limited to certain classes of men, who are either raised by their rank in life above the necessity of serving in person, or engaged in such occupations as can∣not be intermitted without prejudice to the com∣monwealth. It must be allowed, that the regula∣tion in this new act, by which the families of sub∣stitutes are deprived of any relief from the parish,
<PB N="321" REF="3440"/>
will not only diminish the burden of the poor's<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759▪</NOTE> rates; but also, by raising the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice of mercena∣ries, oblige a greater number of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e better sort to serve in person.

The reader will forgive our being so circumstantial upon the regulations of an institution, which we cannot help regarding with a kind of enthusiastic affection.</P>
<P>In the latter end of November the house of commons received a petition of several noblemen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> removing the pow∣der-ma∣gazine from Green∣wich▪</NOTE> gentlemen, and others, inhabitants of East Green∣wich, and places adjacent, in Kent, representing, that in the said parish, within a quarter of a mile of the town distinguished by a royal palace, and royal hospital for seamen, there was a magazine, containing great quantities of gunpowder, fre∣quently to the amount of six thousand barrels; that besides the great danger which must attend all places of that kind, the said magazine stood in an open field, uninclosed by any fortification o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> defence whatsoever, consequently exposed to treachery, and every other accident. They al∣ledged, that if, through treachery, lightning, or any other accident, this magazine should take fire, not only their lives and properties, but the palace and hospital, the king's yards and stores at Dept∣ford and Woolwich, the banks and navigation of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> the Thames, with the ships sailing and at anchor in that river, would be inevitably destroyed; and in∣conceivable damage would accrue to the cities of London and Westminster. They moreover observed, that the magazine was then in a dangerous condi∣tion, supported on all sides by props that were de∣cayed at the foundation; that, in case it should fall, the powder would in all probability, take fire, and produce the dreadful calamities above recited; they therefore prayed, that the magazine might be re∣moved to some more convenient place, where any accident would not be attended with such dismal consequences. The subject of this remonstrance was so pressing and important, that a committee was im∣mediately appointed to take the affair into conside∣ration, and procure an estimate for purchasing lands and erecting a powder-magazine at Purfleet in Essex, near the banks of the river, together with guard-house, barracks, and all other necessary con∣veniences. While the report of the committee lay upon the table for the perusal of the members, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, by his majesty's command, acquainted the house, that the king, having been informed of the subject-matter of the petition, recommended it to the consideration of the commons. Leave was immediately given to prepare a bill, founded on the resolutions of the committee; which, having been duly considered, altered, and amended, passed through both houses to the foot of the throne, where it obtained the royal sanction. The magazine was accordingly re∣moved to Purfleet, an inconsiderable and solitary village, where there will be little danger of acci∣dent, and where no great damage would attend an explosion: but, in order to render this possible
<PB N="323" REF="3460"/>
explosion still less dangerous, it would be necessary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to form the magazine of small distinct apartments, totally independent of each other, that, in case one should be accidentally blown up, the rest might stand unaffected. The same plan ought to be adopted in the construction of all combustible stores, subject to conflagration.

The sheriffs of London delivered a petition of the lord mayor, aldermen, and commons, in common council as∣sembled, representing, that several streets, lanes, and passages within the city of London, and liber∣ties thereof, were too narrow and incommodious for the passing and repassing as well of foot▪passen∣gers as of coaches, carts, and other carriages, to the prejudice and inconvenience of the owners and inhabitants of houses, and to the great hindrance of business, trade, and commerce. They alledged, that these defects might be remedied, and several new streets opened within the said city and liber∣ties, to the great ease, safety, and convenience of passengers, as well as to the advantage of the pub∣lic in general, if they, the petitioners, were en∣abled to widen and enlarge the narrow streets, lanes, and passages, to open and lay out such new streets and ways, and to purchase the several houses, buildings, and grounds, which might be necessary for these purposes. They took notice, that there were several houses, within the city and liberties, partly elected over the ground of other proprie∣tors;
<PB N="324" REF="3470"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> and others, of which the several floors or apartments belonged to different persons; so that difficulties and disputes frequently arose amongst the said several owners and proprietors, about pull∣ing down or rebuilding the party-walls and pre∣misses; that such rebuilding was often prevented▪ or delayed, to the great injury and inconvenience of those owners who were desirous to rebuild; that it would therefore be of public benefit, and fre∣quently prevent the spreading of the fatal effects of fire, if some provision were made by law, as well for determining such disputes in a summary way, as for explaining and amending the laws then in being relating to the building of party walls. They therefore prayed, that leave might be given to bring in a bill for enabling the petitioners to widen and enlarge the several streets, lanes, and passages, and to open new streets and ways, to be therein limited and described; as well as for deter∣mining, in a summary way, all disputes arising about the rebuilding of houses or tenements with∣in the said cities and liberties, wherein several per∣sons have an intermixed property; and for explain∣ing and amending the laws in being relating to these particulars. A committee being appointed to exa∣mine the matter of this petition, agreed to a re∣port, upon which leave was given to prepare a bill, and this was brought in accordingly. Next day a great number of citizens represented, in another petition, that the pavement of the city and liber∣ties was often damaged, by being broken up for the purposes of amending or new laying water∣pipes belonging to the proprietors of water-works; and praying, that provision might be made in the bill then depending, to compel those proprietors to
<PB N="325" REF="3480"/>
make good any damage that should be done to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> pavement by the leaking or bursting of the water∣pipes, or opening the pavement for alterations. In consequence of this representation, some amend∣ments were made in the bill, which passed through both houses, and was enacted into a law, under the title of "An act for widening certain streets, lanes, and passages, within the city of London and liberties thereof; and for opening certain new streets and ways within the same, and for other purposes therein mentioned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The openings to be made, and the passages to be improved and enlarged, were ascertained by two schedules, annexed to the act. With respect to the houses, build∣ings, and grounds to be pur∣chased, the mayor, aldermen, and commons of the city, in common council assembled, or a committee appointed by them, were impowered to fix the price by agreement with the respective proprietors, or otherwise by a jury in the usual manner. With regard to party-walls, the act or∣dains, that the proprietor of either adjoining house may compel the proprietor of the other to agree to its being pulled down and rebuilt, and to pay a moiety of the ex∣pence even though it should not be necessary to pull down or rebuild either of their houses: that all party-walls shall be, at least, two bricks and a half in thickness in the cellar, and two bricks thick upwards to the top of the garret-floor. It enacts, that if any decayed house belongs to several proprietors, any one of them, who is desirous to rebuild, may oblige the others to concur, and join with him in the expence, or purchase their shares at a price to be fixed by a jury. If any house should hereafter be presented by an inquest, or grand jury, in London, as being in a ruin∣ous condition, the court of mayor and aldermen is, by this act, impowered to pull it down at the expence of the ground-landlord. As to da∣maged pavements, not suffi∣ciently repaired by the pro∣prietors of the water-works, any justice of the peace in London is vested with power, upon their refusing or delay∣ing to make it good, to cause it to be effectually relayed with good materials at their expence.</NOTE>.</P>

An act of parlia∣ment had passed in the twenty-second year of his present majesty's reign, for establishing a free market for the sale of fish in Westminster; and, seven years after that period, it was found necessary to procure a second, for explaining and amending the first: but neither effectually answered the pur∣poses of the legislature.</P>
<P>In the month of January, of the present session, the house took into consideration a petition of the several fishermen trading to Billingsgate-market, representing the hardships to which they were ex∣posed by the said acts; particularly forfeitures of vessels and cargoes, incurred by the negligence of servants, who had omitted to make the particular entries which the two acts prescribed. This peti∣tion being examined by a committee, and the re∣port being made, leave was given to bring in a new bill, which should contain effectual provision for the better supplying the cities of London and Westminster with fish, and for preventing the abuses of the fishmongers. It was intitled, "A bill to repeal so much of an act passed in the twenty-ninth of George II. concerning a free market for fish at Westminster, as requires fishermen to enter their fishing-vessels at the office of the searcher of the customs at Gravesend, and to regulate the sale

After all, perhaps the most effec∣tual method for supplying Westminster with plen∣ty of fish, at reasonable rates, would be to execute with rigour the laws already enacted against fore∣stalling and regrating; an expedient that would soon dissolve all monopolies and combinations among the traders; to encrease the number of markets in London and Westminster; and to esta∣blish two general markets at the Nore, one on each side of the river, where the fishing-vessels might unload their cargoes, and return to sea without delay. A number of light boats might be em∣ployed to convey fresh fish from these marts to London and Westminster, where all the different fish-markets might be plentifully supplied at a rea∣sonable expence; for it cannot be supposed, that while the fresh fish are brought up the river in the fishing▪smacks themselves, which can hardly save their tides to Billingsgate, they will ever dream of carrying their cargoes above bridge; or that the price of fish can be considerably lowered, while the fishing vessels lose so much time in running up to Gravesend or Billingsgate.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New act for ascer∣taining the quali∣fications of mem∣bers of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The next law we shall mention was intended to be one of the most important that ever fell under the cognizance of the legislature: it was a law that affected the freedom, dignity, and independency of parliaments. By an act passed in the ninth year of the reign of queen Anne, it was provided that no person should be chosen member of parliament, who did not possess in England or Wales, an es∣tate, freehold or copy-hold, for life, according to the following qualifications: for every knight of a shire, six hundred pounds per annum, over and above what will satisfy all incumbrances; and three hundred pounds per annum for every citizen, bur∣gess, and baron of the cinque-port. It was also decreed, that the return of any person not thus qualified should be void; and that every candidate should, at the reasonable request of any other can∣didate at the time of election, or by two or more
<PB N="333" REF="3560"/>
persons who had a right to vote, take an oath pre∣scribed<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1759.</NOTE> to establish his qualifications. This re∣straint was by no means effectual. So many oaths of different kinds had been prescribed since the Revolution, that they began to lose the effect they were intended to have on the minds of men; and, in particular, political perjury grew so com∣mon, that it was no longer considered as a crime. Subterfuges were discovered, by means of which this law relating to the qualification of candidates was effectually eluded. Those who were not ac∣tually possessed of such estates procured temporary conveyances▪ from their friends and patrons, on condition of their being restored and cancelled after the election. By this scandalous fraud, the inten∣tion of the legislature was frustrated; the dignity of parliament prostituted; the example of perjury and corruption extended; and the vengeance of heaven set at defiance.</P>
<P>Through this infamous channel, the m—had it in their power to thrust into p—a set of venal beggars, who, as they depended upon their bounty, would always be obsequious to their will, and vote according to direction, without the least regard to the dictates of their conscience, or to the advantage of their country. The mischiefs attend∣ing such a vile collusion, and in particular the undue influence which the c—must have acquired from the practice, were either felt or apprehended by some honest patriots, who, after divers unsuccess∣ful efforts, at length presented to the house a bill, importing that every person who shall be elected a member of the house of commons, should, before he presumed to take his seat, deliver to the clerk

<P>The extensive influence of the c—, the gene∣neral corruptibility of individuals, and the obstacles so industriously thrown in the way of every scheme contrived to vindicate the independency of p—ts must have produced very mortifying reflections in the breast of every Briton warmed with the genuine love of his country.

<P>His royal highness has au∣thorized lord T. and sir F.

<P>His royal highness promises and will declare it openly, that it is his intention to total∣ly abolish any distinctions for the future, of parties; and as far as lies in his power, and as soon as it does lie in his power, to take away for ever▪ all proscription from any set of men whatever, who are friends to the constitution; and therefore will promote for the present, and when it is in his power, will imme∣diately grant,</P>
<P>First, A bill to impower all gentlemen to act as jus∣tices of peace, paying land∣tax for 300 <HI>l. per annum,</HI> in any county where he intends to serve.</P>
<P>Secondly, His royal high∣ness promises in like manner to support, and forthwith grant, whenever he shall have it in his power, a bill to create and establish a numerous and effectual militia, throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>Thirdly, His royal high∣ness promises in like manner, to promote and support, and likewise grant, when it is in his power, a bill to exclude all military officers in the land-service, under the degree of colonels of regiments, and in the sea-service, under the degree of rear-admirals, from sitting in the house of com∣mons.</P>
<P>Fourthly, His royal high∣ness promises that he will, when in his power, grant in∣quiries into the great number of abuses in offices, and does not doubt of the assistance of all honest men, to enable him to correct the same for the fu∣ture.</P>
<P>Fifthly, His royal highness promises, and will openly de∣clare, that he will make no agreement with, or join in the support of any administra∣tion whatever, without pre∣viously obtaining the above∣mentioned points in behalf of the people, and for the sake of good government. Upon these conditions, and these conditions only, his royal highness thinks he has a right not to doubt of having a most cordial support, from all those good men, who mean their country and this constitution well, and that they will be∣come his and his family's friends, and unite with him to promote the good govern∣ment of this country; and that they will follow him, up∣on these principles, both in court, and out of court; and if he should live to form an administration, it shall be com∣posed, without distinction, of men of dignity, knowledge, and probity.

<P>The lords and gentlemen to whom a paper has been communicated, containing his royal highness the prince's gracious intentions upon se∣veral weighty and important points, of the greatest conse∣quence to the honour and in∣terest of his majesty's govern∣ment, and absolutely neces∣sary for the restoring, and perpetuating the true use and design of parliament; the pu∣rity of our excellent constitu∣tion, and the happiness and welfare of the whole nation, do therein, with the greatest satisfaction observe, and most gratefully acknowledge, the uprightness and generousity of his royal highness's noble sen∣timents and resolutions.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> On the first day of February, a motion was made, and leave given to bring in a bill, for en∣abling
<PB N="341" REF="3650"/>
his majesty to make leases, and copies of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> offices, lands and hereditaments, parcel of his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Act relat∣ing to leases in Cornwall.</NOTE> dutchy of Cornwall, or annexed to the same; ac∣cordingly it passed through both houses without op∣position, and enacted, that all leases and grants made, or to be made, by his majesty, within seven years next ensuing, in, or annexed to, the said duchy, under the limitations therein mentioned, should be good and effectual in law, against his majesty, his heirs and successors, and against all other persons that should hereafter inherit the said duchy, either by act of parliament, or any limi∣tation whatsoever. This act appears the more ex∣traordinary, as the prince of Wales, who has a sort of right by prescription to the duchy of Corn∣wall, was then of age, and might have been put in possession of it by the passing of a patent.</P>
<P>The legislature did not refuse their attention even to the most humble articles of national oeconomy. In the beginning of February, a petition was pre∣sented
<PB N="342" REF="3660"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to the house by the inhabitants of the coun∣ties of Pembroke, Cardigan, and Merioneth, al∣ledging,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law con∣cerning the ex∣portation of culm from Milford Haven.</NOTE> that lime being the chief manure for land in these counties, without which it would not pro∣duce any tolerable crops of corn, the culm used in burning it, as well as the limestone, was brought from Milford Haven, and the lower parts of the county of Pembroke, by water, to the upper parts of that county, and also to Cardiganshire and Me∣rionethshire, where there were no limestones, nor veins of culm and coal: that the petitioners were greatly aggrieved, by being obliged to pay the duty on such culm; and by other great difficulties and expences to which they were subjected in pro∣curing culm for the aforementioned purpose. They pointed out the good consequences that would arise from the indulgence of the house, should it grant them relief in this particular, of which they ex∣pressed their hope accordingly.</P>
<P>The commons, having perused a number of ac∣counts relating to the exportation of culm from Milford Haven, and the duties paid on this article, ordered a bill to be brought in for rendering the exportation of culm from Milford Haven, and the limits thereof, more easy to the proprietors and purchasers, and for the better securing the duties payable thereon. By this new law it was enacted, that if any person should have occasion to carry culm for the burning of lime, in any vessel not exceeding thirty tons, from any place within the limits of Milford Haven, to any other place within the counties of Pembroke, Carmarthen, Cardi∣gan, or Merioneth, the collector, or his deputy, should, upon application from the master of the
<PB N="343" REF="3670"/>
vessel, grant him a sufferance, mentioning the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> quantity of culm to be shipped: that the officer to whom the sufferance was directed, should attend the shipping thereof, and certify on, the back of the sufferance, the quantity shipped: that, upon paying the duty of one shilling per chaldron, the collector, or his deputy, should grant a certificate, specifying the quantity shipped, and that the du∣ties had been duly paid; which certificate should be a sufficient let pass or clearance of such vessel, to any place within the counties aforesaid; and that no officer should demand or take any other fee, either upon account of granting the said suf∣ferance or certificate, or other pretence whatsoever relating to the loading or sailing of such vessel. It was also enacted, that the master, on his return, should make oath before the collector, or his de∣puty, where and when he landed his former cargo, before being permitted to ship any new cargo, or quantity of culm; with a penalty for preventing fraud, and provision for shipping a like cargo, duty free, in case the former should have been lost. Thus a grievance, which had remained above sixty years, was at length redressed; and pity it is, that the circumstances of the nation will not permit the whole duty on coal and culm to be intirely removed, as it falls so heavy upon manufacture, as well as up∣on people in the middle and lower class of life, who live in a climate which requires the use of fire and fuel for seven or eight months in the year.</P>
<P>The house having perused an account of the pro∣duce of the fund established for paying annuities granted in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine, with the charge on that fund, on the fifth day of January in the succeeding year, it ap∣peared
<PB N="344" REF="3680"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> that there had been a considerable defici∣ency in the said fund on the fifth day of July pre∣ceding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act for cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣dating the an∣nuities granted in the year 1759.</NOTE> and this had been made good out of the sinking fund, by a resolution of the seventh of February, already particularised. They therefore instructed the committee of ways and means, to consider so much of the annuity and lottery act passed in the preceding session, as related to the three per centum annuities, amounting to the sum of seven millions five hundred and ninety thousand pounds, granted in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty nine; and also to consider so much of the said act as related to the subsidy of poundage upon certain goods and marchandizes to be imported into this kingdom, and the additi∣onal inland duty on coffee and chocolate. The committee having taken these points into delibe∣ration, agreed to the two resolutions we have al∣ready mentioned, with respect to the consolidation; and a bill was brought in for adding those annui∣ties granted in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-nine, to the joint stock of three per cen∣tum annuities, consolidated by the acts of the twenty-fifth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirty second years of his majesty's reign; and for several duties therein mentioned, to the sinking fund. The committee was afterwards impowered to receive a clause for cancelling such lottery tickets as were made forth in pursuance of an act passed in the thirtieth year of his majesty's reign, and were not then disposed of: a clause for this purpose was accordingly added to the bill, which passed thro' both houses without opposition, and received the royal assent at the end of the session.</P>

This measure, it is to be hoped, will put an end to the practice of distilling rum from molasses in the British colonies in North America; for great quan∣tities of molasses were daily smuggled into those plantations from the French colonies, and great quantities of spirits distilled from them, for the Indian and African trade, to the manifest preju∣dice of the British sugar-islands, and to the advan∣tage of those inhabited by the French.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for the more effectual securing the pay∣ment of prize and bounty-money appro∣priated to the use of Green∣wich Hospital.</NOTE> Towards the end of April, admiral Townshend presented a bill for the more effectual securing the payment of such prize and bounty monies as were appropriated to the use of Greenwich hospital, by an act passed in the twenty-ninth year of his ma∣jesty's reign. As by that law, no time was li∣mited, or particular method prescribed for giving notifications of the day appointed for the payment of the shares of the prizes and bounty money; and many agents had neglected to specify in the notifi∣cation given in the London Gazette, for payment of shares of prizes condemned in the courts of Ad∣miralty in Great Britain, the particular day or time when such payments were to commence, whereby it was rendered difficult, if not impossible, to as∣certain the time when the hospital at Greenwich became intitled to the unclaimed shares; of con∣sequence could not enjoy the full benefit of the act:
<PB N="346" REF="3700"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> The bill now prepared imported, that from and after the first day of September, in the present year, all notifications of the payment of the shares of prizes taken by any of his majesty's ships of war, and condemned in Great Britain, and from and after the first day of February in the year one thou∣sand seven hundred and sixty-one, all notifications of the payment of the shares of prizes taken and condemned in any other of his majesty's domi∣nions in Europe, or in any of the British planta∣tions in America; and from, and after the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-one, all notifications of the payment of the shares of prizes taken and con∣demned in any other of his majesty's dominions, shall be respectively given and published in the fol∣lowing manner: If the prize be condemned in any court of admiralty in Great Britain▪ such notification, under the agent's hand, shall be published in the London Gazette; and if condemned in any court of Admiralty, in any other of his majesty's dominions, such notifications shall be published in like manner in the Gazette, or other news-paper of public au∣thority, of the island or place where the prize is condemned; and if there shall be no Gazette, or such news-paper published there, then in some or one of the public new-papers of the place; and such agents shall deliver to the collector, customer, or searcher, or his lawful deputy, and if there shall be no such office, then to the principal officer or officers of the place where the prize is condemned, or to the lawful deputy of such principal officer, two of the Gazettes or other news-papers in which such notifications are inserted; and if there shall
<PB N="347" REF="3710"/>
not be any public news-papers in any such island<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> or place, the agent shall give two such notifications in writing, under his hand; and every such col∣lector or other officer as aforesaid, shall subscribe his name on both the said Gazettes, news-papers, or written notifications, and by the first ship which shall sail from thence to any port of Great Britain, shall transmit to the treasurer or deputy treasurers of the said royal hospital, one of the said notifica∣tions with his name so subscribed, to be there re∣gistered, and shall faithfully preserve and keep the other, with his name thereon subscribed, in his own custody; and in every notification as aforesaid, the agent shall specify his place of abode, and the precise day of the month and year appointed for the payment of the respective shares to the cap∣tors; and all notifications with respect to prizes condemned in Great Britain shall be published in the London Gazette three days at least before any share of such prize shall be payed; and with re∣spect to prizes condemned in any other part of his majesty's dominions, such notification shall be de∣livered to the said collector or other officers as aforesaid, three days at least before any share of such prizes shall be payed. It was likewise enacted, that the agents for the distribution of bounty-bills should insert, and publish under their hands, in the London Gazette, three days at least before payment, public notifications of the day and year appointed for such payment, and also insert therein their respective places of abode.</P>
<P>The bill, even as it now stands, is liable to several objections. It may be dangerous to leave the money of the unclaimed shares so long as three

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> years in the hands of the agent, who, together with his securities, may prove insolvent before the ex∣piration of that term: then the time prescribed to the sailors within which their claim is limited appears to be too short, when we consider that they may be so circumstanced, turned over to another ship, and conveyed to a distant part of the globe, that they shall have no opportunity to claim pay∣ment: and should three years elapse before they could make application to the agent, they would find their bounty or prize-money appropriated to the use of Greenwich hospital; nay, should they die in the course of the voyage, it would be lost to their heirs and executors, who, being ignorant of their title, could not possibly claim within the time limited.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Act in fa∣vour of George Keith, late earl marischal.</NOTE> The king having been pleased to pardon George Keith, earl marischal of Scotland, who had been attainted for rebellion in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, the parliament con∣firmed this indulgence, by passing an act to enable the said George Keith, late earl marischal, to sue or entertain any action of suit, notwithstanding his attainder, and to remove any disability in him, by reason of the said attainder, to take or inherit any real or personal estate, that may and shall hereafter descend or come to him, or which he was intitled to in reversion or remainder before his attainder. This nobleman, universally respected for his pro∣bity and understanding, had been employed as am∣bassador to the court of France by the king of Prus∣sia, and was actually at this juncture in the service of that monarch, who, in all probability, interceded with the king of England in his behalf. When his pardon had passed the seals, he repaired to London, and was presented to his majesty, by whom he was very graciously received.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="3740"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> These and a good number of other bills of less importance, both private and public, were passed<NOTE PLACE="marg">Session closed.</NOTE> into laws by commission, on the twenty second day of May, when the lord keeper of the great seal closed the session with a speech to both houses. He began with an assurance, that his majesty looked back on their proceedings with intire satis∣faction. He said, the duty and affection which they had expressed for the king's person and govern∣ment, the zeal and unanimity they had shewed in maintaining the true interest of their country, could only be equalled by what his majesty had formerly experienced from this parliament. He told them it would have given his majesty the most sensible pleasure, had he been able to assure them that his endeavours to promote a general peace had met with more suitable returns. He observed that his ma∣jesty, in conjunction with his good brother and ally the king of Prussia, had chosen to give their ene∣mies proofs of this equitable disposition, in the midst of a series of glorious victories; an oppor∣tunity the most proper to take such a step with dig∣nity, and to manifest to all Europe the purity and moderation of his views. After such a conduct, he said, the king had the comfort to reflect, that the further continuance of the calamities of war could not be imputed to him or his allies; that he trusted in the blessing of heaven upon the justice of his arms, and upon those ample means which the zeal of the parliament, in so good a cause, had wisely put into his hands, that his future successes in carrying on the war, would not fall short of the past: and that, in the event, the public tranquility would be restored on solid and durable foundations. He acquainted them that his majesty had taken
<PB N="351" REF="3750"/>
the most effectual care to augment the combined<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> army in Germany; and at the same time to keep up such a force at home, as might frustrate any at∣tempts of the enemy to invade these kingdoms; such attempts as had hitherto ended only in their own confusion. He took notice that the royal navy was never in a more flourishing and respectable con∣dition; and the signal victory obtained last winter over the French fleet, on their own coasts, had given lustre to his majesty's arms, fresh spirit to his maritime forces, and reduced the naval strength of France to a very low ebb. He gave them to understand that his majesty had disposed his squa∣drons in such a manner, as might best conduce to the annoyance of his enemies; to the defence of his own dominions, both in Europe and America; to the preserving and pursuing his conquests, as well as to the protection of the trade of his sub∣jects, which he had extremely at heart. He told the commons, that nothing could relieve his ma∣jesty's royal mind, under the anxiety he felt for the burthens of his faithful subjects, but the public∣spirited chearfulness with which their house had granted him such large supplies, and his conviction that they were necessary for the security and essen∣tial interests of his kingdoms; he therefore returned them his hearty thanks for these supplies, and as∣sured them, they should be duly applied to the purposes for which they had been given. Finally, he recommended to both houses the continuance of that union and good harmony which he had ob∣served with so much pleasure, and from which he had derived such important effects. He desired they would study to promote these desirable objects,
<PB N="352" REF="3760"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to support the king's government, and the good order of their respective countries, and consult their own real happiness and prosperity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scope of the war seemingly changed.</NOTE> The successes of the last campaign had flushed the whole nation with the most elevated hope of future conquest, and the government was enabled to take every step which appeared necessary to realize that sanguine expectation: but the war became every day more and more germanized. Notwithstand∣ing the immense sums that were raised for the expence of the current year; notwithstanding the great number of land forces maintained in the ser∣vice, and the numerous fleets that filled the har∣bours of Great Britain; we do not find that one fresh effort was made to improve the advantages she had gained upon her own element; or for pushing the war on national principles: for the re∣duction of Canada was no more than the conse∣quence of the measures which had been taken in the preceding campaign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able de∣tection of a murder.</NOTE> But before we record the progress of the war, it may be necessary to specify some domestick oc∣currences, that for a little while engrossed the public attention. In the month of December in the preceding year, William Andrew Horne, a gentleman of some fortune in Derbyshire, was ex∣ecuted at Nottingham, in the seventy-fourth year of his age, for the murder of an infant born of his own sister, in the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty-four. On the third day after the birth, this brutal russian thrust the child in a linen bag, and, accompanied by his own brother on horse∣back, conveyed it to Annesley in Nottinghamshire, where it was next day found dead under a hay∣stack.
<PB N="353" REF="3770"/>
Though this cruel rustic knew how much<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> he lay at the mercy of his brother, whom he had made privy to this affair, far from endeavouring to engage his secrecy by offices of kindness and marks of affection, he treated him as an alien to his blood; not barely with indifference, but even with the most barbarous rigour. He not only de∣frauded him of his right, but exacted of him the lowest menial services; beheld him starving in a cot∣tage, while he lived himself in affluence; and refused to relieve with a morsel of charity, the children of his own brother begging at his gate. It was the resentment of this pride and barbarity which, in all likelihood, first impelled the other to revenge. He pretended qualms of conscience, and disclosed the transaction of the child to several individuals As the brother was universally hated for the insolence and brutality of his disposition, information was given against him, and a resolution formed to bring him to condign punishment. Being informed of this design, he tampered with his brother, and desired that he would retract, upon the trial, the evidence he had given before the justice. Though the bro∣ther rejected this scheme of subornation, he of∣fered to withdraw himself from the kingdom, if he might have five pounds to defray the expence of his removal. So sordidly avaritious was the other, that he refused to advance this miserable pittance, though he knew his own life depended upon his compliance. He was accordingly apprehended; tried, and convicted on his brother's evidence; and then he confessed the particulars of his exposing the infant. He denied, indeed, that he had any thought the child would perish, and declared he intended

With the first tidings of the battle fought at Min∣den, the defamation of this officer arrived. He was accused of having disobeyed orders, and his conduct represented as infamous in every particular. These were the suggestions of a vague report, which no person could trace to its origin; yet this report immediately gave birth to one of the most inflammatory pamphlets that ever were exhibited to
<PB N="355" REF="3790"/>
the public. The first charge had alarmed the peo∣ple<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> of England, jealous in honour, sudden and rash in their resentments, and obstinately adhering to the prejudices they have espoused. The implied accusation in the orders of p—e F—d, and the combustible matter superadded by the pamph∣let writer, kindled up such a blaze of indignation in the minds of the people, as admitted of no tem∣perament or controul. An abhorrence and detesta∣tion of l—d G—S—le, as a coward and a traitor, became the universal passion, which acted by contagion, infecting all degrees of people from the cottage to the t—; and no individual, who had the least regard for his own character and quiet, would venture to preach up moderation, or even advise a suspension of belief, until more certain in∣formation could be received. Fresh fuel was con∣tinually thrown in by obscure authors of pamphlets and news papers, who stigmatized and insulted with such virulent perseverance, that one would have imagined they were actuated by personal mo∣tives, not retained by mercenary booksellers, against that unfortunate nobleman. Not satisfied with inventing circumstances to his dishonour, in his conduct on the last occasion, they pretended to take a retrospective view of his character, and pro∣duced a number of anecdotes to his prejudice, which had never before seen the light, and but for this occasion had probably never been known.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His address to the public.</NOTE> Such precisely was the state of the dispute, when l—G—arrived in London. While p—F—d was crowned with laurel; while the k—of G—t B—n approved his conduct, and as the most glorious mark of that approbation, invested him with the order of the garter; while his name was celebrated through all England, and extoiled in the warmest expressions of hyperbole, above all the heroes of antiquity; every mouth was opened in execration of the late commander of the British troops in Germany. He was now made acquainted with the particulars of this imputed guilt, which he had before indist nctly learned. He was accused of having disobeyed three successive orders he had re∣ceived from the general, during the action at Min∣den, to advance with the cavalry of the right wing, which he commanded, and sustain the infantry that were engaged; and after the cavalry were put in moti∣on, of having halted them unnecessarily, and marched so slow, that they could not reach the place of action in time to be of any service; by which conduct the opportunity was lost of attacking the enemy when they gave way, and rendering the victory more glorious and decisive. The first step which lord G—took towards his own vindication with the
<PB N="357" REF="3810"/>
public, was in printing a short address <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A short address from <HI>Lord GEORGE SACKVILLE</HI> to the <HI>Public.</HI></P>
<P>The various reports that have been propagated to my disadvantage, and the many falshoods which have been asserted to ruin my character, lay me under the necessity of remaining not entirely si∣lent, though I am debarred at present from stating my case to the public, as I should have done, had I not assu∣rances of obtaining a court∣martial for my trial, the only legal and effectual method of convincing the world how little foundation there has been for the torrent of calumny and abuse, which has been so ma∣liciously thrown out against me.</P>
<P>I had rather, upon this oc∣casion, submit myself to all the inconveniencies that may arise from the want of stile, than borrow assistance from the pens of others, as I can have no hopes of establishing my character, but from the force of truth. I shall, there∣fore, as plainly, and distinct∣ly as possible, relate a few cir∣cumstances, which will at least shew that nobody could be more desirous than I was to bring truth to light, and sub∣ject my conduct to the strictest scrutiny.</P>
<P>The instant I found by the implied censure given out in orders the 2d of August, that my conduct had appeared in an unfavourable light to prince Ferdinand, on the day of ac∣tion, I endeavoured to inform myself what particular I had either failed in or neglected my duty; I heard in general of disobedience of orders, but I could fix no certain period of time to my supposed crime, till colonel Fitzroy acquainted me with what had passed be∣tween his serene highness and him upon my subject, in re∣gard to the orders delivered to me by him (colonel Fitz∣roy) that day; whenever my trial comes, I shall endeavour to clear up that point to the satisfaction of the public: my own assertions may have little weight, but the oaths of wit∣nesses, whose veracity cannot be called in question, will, I trust, prove my innocence be∣yond the possibility of doubt.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, I immediately applied for his majesty's permission to return to England, that I might an∣swer anyaccusation that should be brought against me; for, as commander in chief of the British forces in Germany, no person there could order a court-martial for my trial, had there been an accusation
laid; the power of summon∣ing courts martial and ap∣proving their sentences, was vested in me by my commis∣sion, and no British officer or soldier could be tried by any other authority.</P>
<P>As soon as I arrived in Lon∣don, on Friday evening the 7th, I instantly wrote the fol∣lowing letter to the secretary of state.</P>

<P>I thought myself much in∣jured abroad, by an implied censure upon my conduct; I find I am still more unfortu∣nate at home, by being pub∣licly represented as having neglected my duty in the strongest manner, by disobey∣ing the positive orders of his serene highness prince Ferdi∣nand: as I am conscious of neither neglect, nor disobe∣dience of orders; as I am cer∣tain I did my duty to the ut∣most of my abilities; and as I am persuaded that the prince himself would have found, that he had no just cause of com∣plaint against me, had he con∣descended to have enquired into my conduct, before he had expressed his disapproba∣tion of it, from the partial representation of others: I therefore most humbly re∣quest, that I may at last have a public opportunity given me of attempting to justify myself to his majesty, and to my country, by a court-mar∣tial being appointed; that if I am guilty, I may suffer such punishment as I may have de∣served; and, if innocent, that I may stand acquitted in the opinion of the world: but it is really too severe to have been censured unheard, to have been condemned before I was tried, and to be inform∣ed neither of my crime, not my accusers.</P>

This was the body of troops which sustained the brunt of the battle with the most incredible cou∣rage and perseverance. They of their own accord advanced to attack the left of the enemy's cavalry, through a most dreadful fire of artillery and small arms, to which they were exposed in front and flank; they withstood the repeated attacks of the whole French gendarmerie, whom, at length, they totally routed, together with a body of Saxon troops on their left; and to their valour the victory was chiefly owing. The ground from which these troops advanced was a kind of heath or plain, which opened a considerable way to the left, where the rest of the army was formed in order of battle;
<PB N="361" REF="3850"/>
but on the right it was bounded by the wood, on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the other side of which the cavalry of the right wing was posted, having in front the village of Halen, from whence the French had been driven by the piquets in the army there posted, and in front of them a windmill, situated in the middle space between them and a battery placed on the left of the enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Substance of the charge against lord G—</NOTE>Early in the morning captain Malhorti had, by order of prince Ferdinand, posted the cavalry of the right wing in the situation we have just described, the village of Hartum with inclosures on the right, a narrow wood on the left, the village of Halen in their front, and a windmill in the middle of an open plain, which led directly to the enemy. In this po∣sition lord G—S—was directed to remain, until he should receive further orders; and here it was those orders were given which he was said to have disobeyed. Indeed, he was previously charged with having neglected the orders of the preceding evening, which imported, that the horses should be saddled at one in the morning, though the tents were not to be struck, nor the troops under arms, until they should receive further orders. He was accused of having disobeyed these orders, and of having come late in the field, after the cavalry was formed. Captain Winchingrode, aid du camp to prince Ferdinand, declared upon oath, that while the infantry of the right wing were ad∣vancing towards the enemy for the second time, he was sent with orders to lord G—S—to ad∣vance with the cavalry of the right wing, and sus∣tain the infantry, which was going to engage, by forming the horse under his command, upon the
<PB N="362" REF="3860"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> heath in a third line behind the regiments; that he delivered these orders to lord G—S—, giving him to understand that he should march the cavalry through the wood, or trees on his left, to the heath where they were to be formed; that, on his return to the heath, he met colonel Fitzroy riding at full gallop towards lord G—; and that he (Winching∣rode) followed him back in order to hasten the march of the cavalry. Colonel Ligonier, another of the prince's aids du camp, deposed that he carried orders from the general to lord G—to advance with the cavalry, in order to profit from the disorder which appeared in the enemy's cavalry; that lord G—made no answer to these orders, but turning to the troops, commanded them to draw their swords, and march; that the colonel seeing them advance a few paces on the right forwards, told his lordship he must march to the left; that in the mean time colonel Fitzroy arriving with orders for the British cavalry only to advance, lord G—said the orders were contradictory, and colonel Ligonier replied they differed only in numbers; but the destination of his march was the same, to the left. Colonel Fitzroy, the third aid du camp to prince Ferdi∣nand, gave evidence that when he told lord G—it was the prince's order for the British cavalry to advance towards the left, his lordship, observed that it was different from the order brought by colonel Ligonier, and he could not think the prince in∣tended to break the line; that he asked which way the cavalry was to march, and who was to be their guide; that when he (the aid du camp) offered to lead the column through the wood on the left, his lordship seemed still dissatisfied with the order, say∣ing
<PB N="363" REF="3870"/>
it did not agree with the order brought by co∣lonel<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Ligonier, and desired to be conducted in per∣son to the prince, that he might have an explana∣tion from his own mouth; a resolution which was immediately executed. The next evidence, an of∣ficer of rank in the army, made oath that in his opinion, when the orders were delivered to lord G—, his lordship was alarmed to a very great degree, and seemed to be in the utmost con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion. A cer∣tain nobleman, of high rank and unblemished repu∣tation, declared that captain Winchingrode, hav∣ing told him it was absolutely necessary that the cavalry should march and form a line, to support the foot, he had given orders to the second line to march; that as soon as they arrived at the place where the action began, he was met by col. Fitzroy with an order for the cavalry to advance as fast as pos∣sible; that in marching to this place, an order came to halt, until they could be joined by the first line of cavalry; that afterwards, in advancing, they were again halted by lord G—S—; that, in his opi∣nion, they might have marched with more expedi∣tion, and even come up in time enough to act against the enemy: some other officers, who were examined on this subject, agreed with the m—in these sentiments.</P>

Neither of these direction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were observed by any of the aids du camp or officers then present, except one gentleman, the person who bore witness to the confusion in the looks and de∣portment of his lordship. It was proved, that the nearest and most practicable way of advancing against the enemy was by the way of the windmill, to the left of the village of Halen. It appeared that lord G—imagined this was the only way by which he should be ordered to advance; that, in this persuasion, he had sent an officer to reconnoi∣tre the village of Halen as an object of importance, as it would have been upon the flank of the ca∣valry in advancing forwards; that when he receiv∣ed the order from Winchingrode to form the line and advance, he still imagined this was his route, and, on this supposition, immediately detached an aid du camp to remove a regiment of Saxe Gotha, which was in the front; that he sent a second to observe the place where the infantry were, and a third to reconnoitre the enemy; that in a few mi∣nutes, colonel Ligonier coming up with an order from prince F—to advance the cavalry, his lord∣ship immediately drew his sword, and ordered them
<PB N="365" REF="3890"/>
to march forward by the windmill. The colonel<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> declared that when he delivered the order, he added, "by the left!" but lord G—affirmed that he heard no such direction: nor did he reach the ears of any other person then present, except of that officer who witnessed to the same direction given by Win∣chingrode. It was proved that immediately after the troops were put in motion, colonel Fitzroy arrived with an order from prince F—, importing that the British cavalry only should advance by the left; that lord G—declared their orders were contradictory, and seemed the more puzzled, as he understood that both these gentlemen came off nearly at the same time from the prince, and were probably directed to communicate the same order. It was therefore natural to suppose there was a mis∣take, as there might be danger in breaking the line, as the route by the wood appeared more difficult and tedious than that by the windmill, which led directly through open ground to the enemy; and as he could not think that if a body of horse was immediately wanted, the general would send for the British, that were at the farthest extremity of the wing, rather than for the Hanoverian cavalry, who formed the left of the line, and consequently were much nearer the scene of action. It was proved that lord G—, in this uncertainty, resolved to ap∣ply for an explanation to the p—in person, who he understood was at a small distance; that with this view, he set out with all possible expedition; that having entered the wood, and perceived that the country beyond it opened sooner to the left than he had imagined, and captain Smith, his aid du camp, advising that the British cavalry should be
<PB N="366" REF="3900"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> put in motion, he sent back that gentleman with orders for them to advance by the left with all pos∣sible dispatch; that he rode up to the general, who received him without any marks of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pleasure, and ordered him to b ing up the whole cavalry of the right wing in a line upon the heath; an order, as the reader will perceive, quite different from that which was so warmly espoused by the aid du camp, that as the marquis of G—had already put the se∣cond line in motion, according to a separate order which he had received, and the head of his column was already in view, coming out of the wood, lord G—thought it necessary to halt the troops on the left, until the right should come into the line, and afterwards send them orders to march flower, that two regiments, which had been thrown out of the line, might have an opportunity to replace them∣selves in their proper stations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on his defence.</NOTE> With respect to the confusion which one officer affirmed was perceivable in the countenance and deportment of this commander, a considerable num∣ber of other officers then present, being interrogated by his lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dship, unanimously declared, that they saw no such marks of confusion, but that he deli∣vered his orders with all the marks of coolness and deliberation. The candid reader will of himself determine, whether a man's heart is to be judged by any change of his complexion, granting such a change to have happened; whether the evidence of one witness, in such a case, will weigh against the concurrent testimony of all the officers whose immediate business it was to attend and observe the commander: whether it was likely that an officer, who had been more than once in actual service, and

behaved without reproach, so as to attain such an<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> eminent rank in the army, should exhibit symptoms of fear and confusion, when there was in reality no appearance of danger; for none of these orders im∣ported that he should attack the enemy, but only advance to sustain the infantry. The time which elapsed from the first order he received by captain Winchingrode, to the arrival of colonel Ligonier, did not exceed eight minutes, during which his aid du camp, captain Hugo, was em∣ployed in removing the Saxe Gotha regiment from the front, by which he proposed to advance. From that period till the cavalry actually marched, in con∣sequence of an order from lord G—, the length of time was differently estimated in the opinions of dif∣ferent witnesses, but, at a medium, computed by the judge-advocate at fifteen minutes, during which, the following circumstances were transacted: the troops were first ordered to advance forwards, then haited; the contradictory orders arrived and were disputed; the commander desired the two aids du camp to agree about which was the precise order, and he would obey it immediately; each insisting upon that which he had delivered, lord G—hastened to the ge∣neral for an explanation; and as he passed the wood, sent back captain Smith to the right of the cavalry, which was at a considerable distance, to put the Bri∣tish horse in motion. We shall not pretend to deter∣mine whether the commander of such an important body may be excuseable for hesitating, when he re∣ceives contradictory orders at the same time, espe∣cially when both orders run counter to his own judg∣ment; whether in that case it is allowable for him to suspend the operation for a few minutes, in order
<PB N="368" REF="3930"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to consult in person the commander in chief, about a step of such consequence to the preservation of the whole army. Neither will we venture to decide dog∣matically on the merits of the march, after the ca∣valry were put in motion; whether they marched too slow, or were unnecessarily halted, in their way to the heath. It was proved indeed, that lord G—was always remarkably slow in his movements of cavalry, on the supposition that if horses are blown, they must be unfit for service, and that the least hurry is apt to disorder the line of horse to such a degree, as would rob them of their proper effect, and render all their efforts abortive. This being the system of lord G—S—e, it may de∣serve consideration, whether he could deviate from it on this delicate occasion, without renouncing the dictates of his own judgment and discretion; and whether he was at liberty to use his own judgment, after having received the order to advance. After all, whether he was intentionally guilty, and what were the motives by which he was really actuated, are questions which his own conscience alone can solve. Even granting him to have hesitated from perplexity, to have lingered from vexation, to have failed through error of judgment, he will probably find favour with the candid and humane part of his fellow subjects, when they reflect upon the nature of his situation, placed at the head of such a body of cavalry, uninstructed and uninform∣ed of plan or circumstance, divided from the rest of the army, unacquainted with the operations of the day, chagrined with doubt and disappointment, and perplexed by contradictory orders, neither of which he could execute without offering violence

His sentence was confirmed by the king, who moreover signified his pleasure, that it should be given out in public orders, not only in Bri∣tain, but in America and every quarter of the globe, where any English troops happened to be, that officers being convinced, that neither high birth nor great employments can shelter offences of such a nature; and that seeing they are subject to censures, much worse than death to a man who has any sense of honour, they may avoid the fatal con∣sequences arising from disobedience of orders.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earl Fer∣rers ap∣prehend∣ed for murder.</NOTE> This summer was distinguished by another trial, still more remarkable. Laurence earl Ferrers, a nobleman of a violent spirit, who had committed many outrages, and, in the opinion of all who

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> knew him, given manifold proofs of insanity, at length perpetrated a murder, which subjected him to the cognizance of justice. His deportment to his lady was so brutal, that application had been made to the house of peers, and a separation effected by act of parliament. Trustees were nominated; and one Mr. Johnson, who had, during the best part of his life, been employed in the family, was now appointed receiver of the estates, at the earl's own request. The conduct of this man in the course of his stewardship gave umbrage to lord Ferrers, whose disposition was equally jealous and vindictive. He imagined all his own family had conspired against his interest, and that Johnson was one of their accomplices; that he had been in∣strumental in obtaining the act of parliament, which his lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship considered as a grievous hardship; that he had disappointed him in regard to a certain con∣tract about coal-mines; in a word, that there was a collusion between Johnson and the earl's adversa∣ries. Fired with these suppositions, he first ex∣pressed his resentment by giving Johnson notice to quit the farm which he possessed on the estate; but finding the trustees had confirmed the lease, he determined to gratify his revenge by assassination, and laid his plan accordingly. On Sunday the thirteenth of January, he appointed this unhappy man to come to his house, on the Friday following, in order to peruse papers, or settle accompts; and Johnson went thither, without the least suspicion of what was prepared for his reception: for although he was no stranger to his lordship's dangerous dis∣position, and knew he had some time before incur∣red his displeasure, yet he imagined his resentment

had intirely subsided, as the earl had of late behaved<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to him with remarkable complacency. He there∣fore at the time appointed repaired to his lordship's house of Stanton in Leicestershire, at the distance of a short m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le from his own habitation, and was admitted by a maid servant. The earl had dismissed every person in the house, upon various pretences, except three women who were left in the kitchen. Johnson advancing to the door of the apartment, was received by his lordship, who desired him to walk into another room, where he joined him in a few minutes, and then the door was locked on the inside. After a great deal of warm expostulation, the earl insisted upon his subs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribing a paper, ac∣knowledging himself a villain; and on his refusing to comply with this demand, declared he would put him to death. In vain the unfortunate man re∣monstrated against this cruel injustice, and depre∣cated the indignation of this furious nobleman. He remained deaf to all his intreaties, drew forth a pistol, which he had loaded for the purpose, and commanding him to implore heaven's mercy on his knees, shot him through the body while he remained in that supplicating attitude. The con∣sequence of this violence was not immediate death; but his lordship seeing the wretched victim still alive and sensible, tho' agonized with pain, felt a momentary motion of pity. He ordered his ser∣vants to convey Mr. Johnson up-stairs to a bed, to send for a su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>geon, and give immediate notice of the accident to the wounded man's family. When Mr. Johnson's daughter came to the house, she was met by the earl, who told her he had shot her fa∣ther on purpose, and with deliberation.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="3990"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> The same declaration he made to the surgeon at his arrival. He stood by him while he examined the wound, described the manner in which the ball had penetrated, and seemed surprised that it should be lodged within the body. When he demanded the surgeon's opinion of the wound, the operator thought proper to temporize, for his own safety, as well as for the sake of the public, left the earl should take some other desperate step, or endea∣vour to escape. He therefore amused him with hopes of Johnson's recovery, about which he now seemed extremely anxious. He supported his spirits by immoderate drinking, after having re∣tired to another apartment with the surgeon, whom he desired to take all possible care of his patient. He declared, however, that he did not repent of what he had done; that Johnson was a villain, who deserved to die; that in case of his death, he (the earl) would surrender himself to the house of peers, and take his trial. He said he could justify the action to his own conscience; and owned his intention was to have killed Johnson outright; but as he still survived, and was in pain, he de∣sired that all possible means might be used for his recovery. Nor did he seem altogether neglectful of his own safety: he endeavoured to tamper with the surgeon, and suggest what evidence he should give when called before a court of justice. He continued to drink himself into a state of in∣toxication, and all the cruelty of his hate seemed to return. He would not allow the wounded man to be removed to his own house, saying, he would keep him under his own roof, that he might plague the villain. He returned to the chamber where Johnson
<PB N="375" REF="4000"/>
lay, insulted him with the most opprobrious lan∣guage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> threatened to shoot him through the head, and could hardly be restrained from commit∣ing further acts of violence on the poor man, who was already in extremity. After he retired to bed, the surgeon procured a sufficient number of assistants, who conveyed Mr. Johnson in an easy∣chair to his own house, where he expired that same morning, in great agonies. The same surgeon as∣sembled a number of armed men to seize the mur∣derer, who at first threatened resistance, but was soon apprehended, endeavouring to make his es∣cape, and committed to the county prison. From thence he was conveyed to London by the goaler of Leicester, and conducted by the usher of the black rod and his deputy into the house of lords, where the coroner's inquest, and the affidavits touching the murder being read, the goaler deli∣vered up his prisoner to the care of the black rod, and he was immediately committed to the Tower. He appeared very calm, composed, and uncon∣cerned, from the time of his being apprehended; conversed cooly on the subject of his imprisonment; made very pertinent remarks upon the nature of the habeas corpus act of parliament, of which he hoped to avail himself; and when they withdrew from the house of peers, desired he might not be visited by any of his relations or acquaintances. His understanding, which was naturally good, had been well cultivated; his arguments were rational, but his conduct was frantic.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His trial by the House of P—rs.</NOTE> The circumstances of this assassination appeared so cruel and deliberate, that the people cried aloud for vengeance; and the government gave up the
<PB N="376" REF="4010"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> offender to the justice of his country. The lord-keeper Henley was appointed lord high steward for the trial of earl Ferrers, and sat in state with all the peers and judges in Westminster-hall, which was for this purpose converted into a very august tribunal. On the sixteenth day of April the delin∣quent was brought from the Tower in a coach, at∣tended by the major of the Tower, the gentleman∣gaoler, the wardours, and a detachment of the foot-guards. He was brought into court about ten; and the lord steward with the peers taking their places, he was arraigned aloud, in the midst of an infinite concourse of people, including many foreigners, who seemed wonderfully struck with the magnificence and solemnity of the tribunal. The murder was fully proved by unquestionable evidence: but the earl pleaded insanity of mind; and, in order to establish this plea, called many witnesses to attest his lunacy in a variety of in∣stances, which seemed too plainly to indicate a disordered imagination: unfounded jealousy of plots and conspiracies, unconnected ravings, fits of musing, incoherent ejaculations, sudden starts of fury, denunciations of unprovoked revenge, frantic gesticulations, and a strange caprice of tem∣per, were proved to have distinguished his conduct and deportment. It appeared, that lunacy had been a family taint, and affected divers of his lordship's relations; that a sollicitor of reputation had renounced his business, on the full persuasion of his being disordered in his brain; that, long before this unhappy event, his nearest relations had deliberated upon the expediency of taking out a commission of lunacy against him, and were pre∣vented
<PB N="377" REF="4020"/>
by no other reason than the apprehension<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> of being convicted of <HI>scandalum magnatum,</HI> should the jury find his lordship <HI>compos mentis;</HI> a circum∣stance which in all probability would have hap∣pened, inasmuch as the earl's madness did not ap∣pear in his conversation, but in his conduct. A physician of eminence, whose practice was con∣fined to persons labouring under this infirmity, declared that the particulars of the earl's deport∣ment, and personal behaviour, seemed to indicate lunacy. Indeed, all his neighbours and acquain∣tances had long considered him as a madman; and a certain noble l—declared in the h—of p—, when the bill of separation was on the carpet, that he looked upon him in the light of a maniac; and that, if some effectual step was not taken to divest him of the power of doing mischief, he did not doubt but that one day they should have occa∣sion to try him for murder. The lawyers, who managed the prosecution in behalf of the crown, endeavoured to invalidate the proofs of his lunacy, by observing, that his lordship was never so much deprived of his reason, but that he could distin∣guish between good and evil; that the murder he had committed was the effect of revenge, for a conceived injury of some standing; that the ma∣lice was deliberate, and the plan artfully con∣ducted; that, immediately after the deed was per∣petrated, the earl's conversation and reasoning was cool and consistent, until he drank himself into a state of intoxication; that, in the opinion of the greatest lawyers, no criminal can avail himself of the plea of lunacy, provided the crime was com∣mitted during a lucid interval: but his lordship,
<PB N="378" REF="4030"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> far from exhibiting any marks of insanity, had, in the course of this trial, displayed uncommon un∣derstanding and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty in examining the wit∣nesses, and making many shrewd and pertinent observations on the evidence which was given. These se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ments were conformable to the opinion of the peers, who unanimously declared him guil∣ty. After all, in examining the vitious actions of a man, who has betrayed manifest and manifold symptoms of insanity, it is not easy to distinguish those which were committed during the lucid in∣terval. The suggestions of madness are often mo∣mentary and transient: the determinations of a lunatic, though generally rash and instantaneous, are sometimes the result of artful contrivance; but there is always an absurdity which is the criterion of the disease, either in the premises or conclusion. The earl, it is true, had formed a deliberate plan for the perpetration of the murder; but he had taken no precautions for his own safety, or escape: and this neglect will the more plainly appear to have been the criterion of insanity, if we reflect that he just fied what he had done as a meritorious action; and declared he would, upon Mr. John∣son's death, surrender himself to the house of lords. Had he been impelled to this violence by a sudden gust of passion, it could not be expected that he should have taken any measures for his own pre∣servation; but as it was the execution of a delibe∣rate scheme, and his lordship was by no means de∣fective in point of ingenuity, he might easily have contrived means for concealing the murder, until he should have accomplished his escape: and, in our opinion, any other than a madman would either
<PB N="379" REF="4040"/>
have taken some such measures, or formed some<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> plan for the concealment of his own guilt. The design itself seems to have been rather an intended sacrifice to justice, than a gratification of revenge. Neither do we think that the sanity of his mind was ascertained by the accuracy and deliberation with which he made his remarks, and examined the evidence at his trial. The influence of his frenzy might be past; though it was no sign of sound reason to supply the prosecutor with such an argument to his prejudice. Had his judgment been really unimpaired, he might have assumed the masque of lunacy for his own preservation.</P>
<P>The trial was continued for two days; and on the third the lord steward, after having made a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convict∣ed;</NOTE> short speech touching the heinous nature of the of∣fence, pronounced the same sentence of death upon the earl which malefactors of the lowest class undergo; that from the Tower, in which he was imprisoned, he should, on the Monday following, be led to the common place of execution, there to be hanged by the neck, and his body be afterwards dissected and anatomized. This last part of the sentence seemed to shock the criminal extremely: he changed colour, his jaw quivered, and he ap∣peared to be in great agitation; but during the remaining part of his life he behaved with sur∣prising composure, and even unconcern. After he had received sentence, the lords his judges, by virtue of a power vested in them, respited his exe∣cution for one month, that he might have time to settle his temporal and spiritual concerns. Before sentence was passed, the earl read a paper, in which
<PB N="380" REF="4050"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> he begged pardon of their lordships for the trouble he had given, as well as for having, against his own inclination, pleaded lunacy at the request of his friends. He thanked them for the candid trial with which he had been indulged, and intreated their lordships to recommend him to the king for mercy. He afterwards sent a letter to his m—, remonstrating, that he was the representative of a ve y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antient and honourable family, which had been allied to the crown; and requesting, that, it he could not be favoured with the species of death which, in cases of treason, distinguishes the noble∣man from the plebeian, he might at least, out of consideration of his family, be allowed to suffer in the Tower, rather than at the common place of execution: but this indulgence was refused. From his return to the Tower, to the day of his execu∣tion, he betrayed no mark of apprehension or im∣patience; but regulated his affairs with precision, and conversed without concern or restraint.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and exe∣culed at Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n.</NOTE> On the fifth day of May, his body being de∣manded by the sheriffs at the Tower gate, in con∣sequence of a writ under the great seal of England, directed to the lieutenant of the Tower, his lord∣ship desired permission to go in his own landau, and appeared gaily dressed in a light-coloured suit of cloaths, embroidered with silver. He was at∣tended in the landau by one of the sheriffs, the chaplain of the Tower, followed by the cha∣riots of the sheriffs, a mourning-coach and six f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed with his friends, and a hearse for the con∣veyance of his body. He was guarded by a posse of constables, a party of horse▪grenadiers, and a
<PB N="381" REF="4060"/>
detachment of infantry; and in this manner the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> procession moved from the Tower, through an in∣finite concourse of people, to Tyburn, where the gallows, and a scaffold erected under it, appeared covered with black bays. The earl behaved with great composure to Mr. sheriff Vaillant, who at∣tended him in the landau: he observed, that the gaiety of his apparel might seem odd on such an occasion; but that he had particular reasons for wearing that suit of cloaths: he took notice of the vast multitude which crouded around him, brought thither, he supposed, by curiosity to see a nobleman hanged: he told the sheriff he had applied to the king, by letter, that he might be permitted to die in the Tower, where the earl of Essex, one of his ancestors, had been beheaded in the reign of queen Elizabeth; an application which, he said, he had made with the more confidence, as he had the ho∣nour to quarter part of his majesty's arms. He expressed some displeasure at being executed as a common felon, exposed to the eyes of such a mul∣titude. The chaplain, who had never been ad∣mitted to him before, hinting that some account of his lordship's sentiments on religion would be ex∣pected by the public, he made answer, that he did not think himself accountable to the public for his private sentiments; that he had always adored one God, the creator of the universe; and, with re∣spect to any particular opinions of his own, he had never propagated them, or endeavoured to make proselytes; because he thought it was criminal to disturb the established religion of his country, as lord B—had done by the publication of
<PB N="382" REF="4070"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> his writings. He added, that the great number of sects, and the multiplication of religious disputes, had almost banished morality. With regard to the crime for which he suffered, he declared that he had no malice against Mr. Johnson; and that the murder was owing to a perturbation of mind, oc∣casioned by a variety of crosses and vexations. When he approached the place of execution, he expressed an earnest desire to see and take leave of a certain person who waited in a coach; a person for whom he entertained the most sincere regard and affection: but the sheriff prudently observing that such an interview might shock him, at a time when he had occasion for all his fortitude and re∣collection, he acquiesced in the justness of the re∣mark, and delivered to him a pocket-book, a ring, and a purse, desiring they might be given to that person, whom he now declined seeing. On his ar∣rival at Tyburn he came out of the landau, and ascended the scaffold with a firm step and undaunted countenance. He refused to join the chaplain in his devotions; but, kneeling with him on black cushions, he repeated the Lord's Prayer, which he said he had always admired; and added, with great energy, "O Lord, forgive me all my errors, par∣don all my sins." After this exercise, he presented his watch to Mr. sheriff Vaillant, thanked him and the other gentleman for all their civilities; and signified his desire of being buried at Breden, or Stanton, in Leicestershire. Finally, he grati∣fied the executioner with a purse of money: then the halter being adjusted to his neck, he stepped upon a little stage, erected upon springs, on the
<PB N="383" REF="4080"/>
middle of the scaffold; and, the cap being pulled<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> over his eyes, the sheriff made a signal, at which the stage fell from under his feet, and he was left suspended. His body, having hung an hour and five minutes, was cut down, placed in the hearse, and conveyed to the public theatre for dissection, where being opened, and lying for some days as the subject of a public lecture, at length it was car∣ried off, and privately interred.</P>
<P>Without all doubt, this unhappy nobleman's disposition was so dangerously mischievous, that it became necessary, for the good of society, either to confine him for life, as an incorrigible lunatic, or give him up at once as a sacrifice to justice. Per∣haps it might be no absurd nor unreasonable regu∣lation in the legislature, to divest all lunatics of the privilege of insanity, and, in cases of enormity, subject them to the common penalties of the law; for though, in the eye of casuistry, consciousness must enter into the constitution of guilt, the con∣sequences of murder, committed by a maniac, may be as pernicious to society as those of the most cri∣minal and deliberate assassination: and the punish∣ment of death can be hardly deemed unjust, or ri∣gorous, when inflicted upon a mischievous being, divested of all the perceptions of reason and huma∣nity. At any rate, as the nobility of England are raised by many illustrious distinctions above the level of plebeians, and as they are eminently dis∣tinguished from them in suffering punishment for high treason, which the law considers as the most atrocious crime that can be committed, it might not be unworthy of the notice of the legislature to
<PB N="384" REF="4090"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> deliberate whether some such pre-eminence ought not to be extended to noblemen convicted of other crimes; in order to alleviate as much as possible the disgrace of noble families which have deserved well of their country; to avoid any circumstances that may tend to diminish the lustre of the English nobility in the eyes of foreign nations; or to bring it in contempt with the common people of our own, already too licentious, and prone to abolish those distinctions, which serve as the basis of decorum, order, and subordination.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assassina∣tion by one Stirn a Hessian.</NOTE> Hornicide is the reproach of England: one would imagine there is something in the climate of this country, that not only disposes the natives to this inhuman outrage, but even infects foreigners who reside among them. Certain it is, high pas∣sions will break out into the most enormous vio∣lences, in that country where they are least con∣trouled by the restraint of regulation and disci∣pline; and it is equally certain, that in no civi∣lized country under the sun, there is such a relaxa∣tion of discipline, either religious or civil, as in England. The month of August produced a re∣markable instance of desperate revenge, perpe∣trated by one Stirn, a native of Hesse-Cassel, in∣flamed and exasperated by a false punctilio of ho∣nour. This unhappy young man was descended of a good family, and possessed many accomplish∣ments both of mind and person: but his character was distinguished by such a jealous sensibility, as ren∣dered him unhappy in himself, and disagreeable to his acquaintance. After having for some years performed the office of usher in a boarding-school,
<PB N="385" REF="4100"/>
he was admitted to the house of one Mr. Mat∣thews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> a surgeon, in order to teach him the classics, and instruct his children in music, which he per∣fectly understood. He had not long resided in this family, when the surgeon took umbrage at some part of his conduct, taxed him roughly with fraud and ingratitude, and insisted upon his re∣moving to another lodging. Whether he rejected this intimation, or found difficulty in procuring another apartment, the surgeon resolved to expel him by violence, called in the assistance of a peace∣officer, and turned him out into the street in the night, after having loaded him with the most pro∣voking reproaches. These injuries and disgraces operating upon a mind jealous by nature, and gal∣led by adversity, produced a kind of phrenzy of resentment; and he took the desperate resolution of sacrificing Matthews to his revenge. Next day, having provided a case of pistols, and charged them for the occasion, he reinforced his rage by drinking an unusual quantity of wine, and repaired in the evening to a public house which Mr. Mat∣thews frequented, in the neighbourhood of Hat∣ton-Garden. There he accordingly found the un∣happy victim sitting with some of his friends; and the surgeon, instead of palliating his former conduct, began to insult him afresh with the most oppro∣brious invectives. Stirn, exasperated by this ad∣ditional indignity, pulled his pistols from his bo∣som, shot the surgeon, who immediately expired, and discharged the other at his own breast, though his confusion was such that it did not take effect. He was apprehended on the spot, and conveyed to
<PB N="386" REF="4110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> prison, where, for some days, he refused all kind of sustenance, but afterwards became more com∣posed. At his trial he pleaded insanity of mind; but being found guilty, he resolved to anticipate the execution of the sentence. That same even∣ing he drank poison; and notwithstanding all the remedies that could be administered, died in strong convulsions. His body was publicly dissected, according to the sentence of the law, and after∣wards interred with those marks of indignity which are reserved for the perpetrators of sui∣cide.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A lady murdered by her coach∣man.</NOTE> The same period was distinguished by another assassination equally shocking, and much more de∣liberate. The coachman of one Dr. Clark at High-Wycomb in Buckinghamshire, passing with the carriage through a solitary lane, suddenly stopped and alighted; then violently pulled the doctor's lady out of the coach, and with a sharp knife stab∣bed her in several parts of the body, so that she languished three days, and then expired in great agony. That the murder was preconceived, ap∣peared from his having provided a loaded pistol, which he discharged at his pursuers; but missing his aim, he was seized and brought to condign pu∣nishment. What rendered this desperate action the more extraordinary and unaccountable, was the character of the assassin, who had always behaved remarkably well in his station, and had not the least cause of complaint against his mistress: cir∣cumstances which seem to imply that the murder was the result of a disordered imagination. We might swell the register of annual murders with
<PB N="387" REF="4120"/>
other instances that shock humanity; but we turn<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> our eyes with horror, from these private scenes of blood, which history would never deign to record, except in hope of stimulating the public to some effectual expedients of prevention.</P>

The committee appointed to manage the under∣taking for a new bridge over the river Thames at Black-friars, having received and examined a va∣riety of plans, presented by different artists, at length gave the preference to the design of one Mr. Mylne, a young architect, a native of North-Britain, just returned from the prosecution of his studies at Rome, where he had gained the prize in the Capitol, which the academy of that city be∣stows on him who produces the most beautiful and useful plan on a given subject of architecture. This young man being at London, in his return to his own country, was advised to declare himself a can∣didate for the superintendency of the new bridge; and the plan which he presented was approved and adopted. The place being already ascertained, the lord-mayor of London, attended by the commit∣tee, and a great concourse of people repaired to Black-friars, and laid the first stone of the bridge, placing upon it a plate with an inscription, which does more honour to the public spirit of the un∣dertakers,

<PB N="389" REF="4140"/>
an immense value. The damage, however, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> so immediately repaired, that it had no sort of ef∣fect in disconcerting any plan, or even in retarding any naval preparation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of ships taken by the ene∣my.</NOTE> How important these preparations must have been, may be judged from the prodigious increase of the navy, which, at this juncture, amounted to one hundred and twenty ships of the line, besides frigates, fireships, sloops, bombs, and tenders. Of these capital ships seventeen were stationed in the East Indies, twenty for the defence of the West-Indian islands, twelve in North America, ten in the Mediterranean, and sixty-one, either on the coast of France, in the harbours of England, or cruising in the English seas for the protection of the British commerce. Notwithstanding these nu∣merous and powerful armaments, the enemy, who had not a ship of the line at sea, were so alert with their small privateers and armed vessels, that, in the beginning of this year, from the first of March to the tenth of June, they had made prize of two hundred vessels belonging to Great Britain and Ire∣land. The whole number of British ships taken by them, from the first day of June, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fifty-six, to the first of June in the present year, amounted to two thou∣sand five hundred and thirty-nine; of these se∣venty-eight were privateers, three hundred and twenty-one were retaken, and about the same num∣ber ransomed. In the same space of time, the Bri∣tish cruisers had made captures of nine hundred forty-four vessels, including two hundred forty-two privateers, many fishing-boats and small coasters, the value of which hardly defrayed the expence of
<PB N="390" REF="4150"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> condemnation. That such a small proportion of ships should be taken from the enemy, is not at all sur∣prising, when we consider the terrible shocks their commerce had previously received, and the great number of their mariners imprisoned in England: but the prodigious number of British vessels, taken by their petty coasting privateers, in the face of such mighty armaments, numerous cruisers and convoys, seems to argue, that either the English ships of war were inactive or improperly disposed, or that the merchants hazarded their ships without convoy. Certain it is, in the course of this year we find fewer prizes taken from the enemy, and fewer exploits atchieved at sea, than we had occa∣sion to record in the annals of the past.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of Thu∣rot.</NOTE> Not that the present year is altogether barren of events, which redound to the honour of our marine commanders. We have, in recounting the tran∣sactions of the preceding year, mentioned a small armament equipped at Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kirk, under the com∣mand of Mr. de Thurot, who, in spight of all the vigilance of the British commander stationed in the Downs, found means to escape from the har∣bour in the month of October last, and arrived at Gottenburgh in Sweden, from whence he proceed∣ed to Bergen in Norway. H s instructions were to make occasional descents upon the coast of Ireland, and, by dividing the troops, and distracting the at∣tention of the government in that kingdom, to fa∣cilitate the enterprize of Mr. de Conflans, the fate of which we have already narrated. The original armament of Thurot consisted of five ships, one of which, called the Mareschal de Belleisle, was mounted with forty-four guns; the Begon, the
<PB N="391" REF="4160"/>
Blond, the Terpsichore, had thirty guns each, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the Marante carried twenty-four. The number of soldiers put on board this little fleet, did not ex∣ceed one thousand two hundred and seventy, ex∣clusive of mariners to the number of seven hun∣dred; but two hundred of the troops were sent sick on shore, before the armament sailed from Dun∣kirk; and in their voyage between Gottenburgh and Bergen they lost company of the Begon, during a violent storm. The severity of the wea∣ther detained them nineteen days at Bergen, at the expiration of which they set sail for the western islands of Scotland, and discovered the northern part of Ireland in the latter end of January. The intention of Thurot was to make a descent about Derry; but before this design could be executed, the weather growing tempestuous, and the wind blowing off shore, they were driven out to sea, and, in the night, lost sight of the Marante, which never joined them in the sequel. After having been tempest-beaten for some time, and exposed to a very scanty allowance of provision, the officers re∣quested of Thurot, that he would return to France, lest they should all perish by famine, but he lent a deaf ear to this proposal, and frankly told them he could not return to France, without having struck some stroke for the service of his country. Nevertheless, in hope of meeting with some re∣freshment, he stecred to the island of Isla, where the troops were landed, and here they sound black cattle, and a small supply of oatmeal, for which they payed a reasonable price; and it must be owned, Thurot himself behaved with great mode∣tion and generosity.</P>

Bodies of regular troops and militia were posted along the coasts of Ireland and Scotland; and besides the squadron of commodore Boys, who sailed to the northward on purpose to pursue the enemy, other ships of war were ordered to scour the Bristol chan∣nel, and cru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ze between Scotland and Ireland. The weather no sooner permitted Thurot to pursue his destination, than he sailed from Isla to the bay of Carrickfergus in Ireland, and made all the ne∣cessary preparations for a descent; which was ac∣cordingly effected, with six hundred men, on the twenty-first day of February. Lieutenant colonel Jennings, who commanded four companies of raw undisciplined men at Carrickfergus, having re∣ceived information that three ships had anchored about two miles and a half from the castle, which was ruinous and defenceless, immediately detached a party to make observations, and ordered the French prisoners there confined to be removed to Belfast. Mean while, the enemy landing without opposition, advanced towards the town, which they found as well guarded as the nature of the place, which was intirely open, and the circumstances of the English commander, would allow. A regular attack was carried on, and a spirited defence <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One circumstance that attended this dispute, deserves to be transmitted to posterity, as an instance of that cou∣rage, mingled with humani∣ty, which constitutes true he∣roism. While the French and English were hotly engaged in one of the streets, a little child ran playfully between them, having no idea of the danger to which it was ex∣posed: a common soldier of the enemy, perceiving the life of this poor innocent at stake, grounded his piece, advanced deliberately between the lines of fire, took up the child in his arms, conveyed it to a place of safety; then re∣turning to his place, resumed his musket, and renewed his hostility.</NOTE>

made, until the ammunition of the English failed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> then colonel Jennings retired in order to the castle, which however was in all respects untenable; for, besides a breach in the w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll near fifty feet wide, they found themselves destitute of provision and ammunition. Nevertheless, they repulsed the as∣sailants in their first attack, even after the gate was burst open, and supplied the want of shot with stones and rubbish. At length, the colonel and his troops were obliged to surrender, on condition that they should not be sent prisoners to France, but be ransomed by sending thither an equal num∣ber of French prisoners from Great Britain or Ire∣land; that the castle should not be demolished, nor the town of Carrickfergus plundered or burned, on condition that the mayor and corporation should furnish the French troops with necessary provi∣sions. The enemy, after this exploit, did not pre∣sume to advance farther into the country; a step which indeed they could not have taken, with any regard to their own safety: for by this time a con∣siderable body of regular troops was assembled; and the people of the country manifested a lau∣dable spirit of loyalty and resolution, crowding in great numbers to Belfast, to offer their service against the invaders. These circumstances, to which the enemy were no strangers, and the defeat of Conflans, which they had also learned, obliged

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He him∣self is slain, and his ships are taken.</NOTE> The fate they escaped on shore, they soon met with at sea. Captain John Elliot, who commanded three frigates at Kinsale, and had in the course of this war more than once already distinguished him∣self, even in his early youth, by extraordinary acts of valour, was informed by a dispatch from the duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of Ireland, that three of the enemy's ships lay at anchor in the bay of Carrickfergus, and thither he immediately shaped his course in the ship Aeolus, accompanied by the Pallas and Brilliant, under the command of the captains Clements and Logie. On the twenty-eighth day of February they descried the enemy, and gave chace, in sight of the Isle of Man; and about nine in the morning captain Elliot, in his own ship, engaged the Belleisle, commanded by Thurot, altho' considerably his superior in strength of men, number of guns, and weight of metal. In a few minutes his consorts were also engaged with the other two ships of the enemy. After a warm action maintained with great spirit on all sides for an hour and a half, captain Elliot's lieutenant boarded the Belleisle, and, striking her colours with his own hand, the commander submitted: his ex∣ample was immediately followed by the other French captains, and the English commodore, taking possession of his prizes, conveyed them into the bay of Ramsay in the Isle of Man, that their damage might be repaired. Though the Belleisle was very leaky, and had lost her boltsprit, mizen∣mast, and main-yard, in all probability the victory
<PB N="195" REF="4200"/>
would not have been so easily obtained, had not<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the gallant Thurot fallen during the action. The victor had not even the consolation to perform the last offices to his brave enemy; for his body was thrown into the sea by his own people in the hurry of the engagement. The loss on the side of the English did not exceed forty men killed and wounded; whereas above three hundred of the enemy were slain or disabled. The service per∣formed on this occasion was deemed so essential to the peace and commerce of Ireland, that the thanks of the house of commons in that kingdom were voted to the conquerors of Thu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, as well as to lieutenant▪colonel Jennings for his spirited beha∣viour at Carricksergus; and the freedom of the city of Cork was presented in silver boxes to the cap∣tains Elliot, Clements, and Logie. The name of Thurot was become terrible to all the trading sea∣ports of Britain and Ireland; and therefore the defeat and capture of his squadron were celebrated with as hearty rejoicings, as the most important victory could have produced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Exploit of captain Kennedy.</NOTE> In the beginning of April another engagement between four frigates, still more equally matched, had a different issue, though not less honourable for the British commanders. Captain Skinner of the Biddeford, and captain Kennedy of the Flambo∣rough, both frigates, sailed on a cruize from Lis∣bon; and on the fourth day of April fell in with two large French frigates, convoy to a fleet of mer∣chant-ships, which the English captains imme∣diately resolved to engage. The enemy did not decline the battle, which began about half an hour
<PB N="396" REF="4210"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> after six in the evening, and raged with great fury till eleven. By this time the Flamborough had lost sight of the Biddeford, and the frigate with which captain Kennedy was engaged bore away with all the sail she could carry. He pursued her till noon the next day, when she had left him so far astern, that he lost sight of her, and returned to Lisbon, with the loss of fifteen men killed and wounded, including the lieutenant of marines, and considerable damage both in her hull and rigging. In three days he was joined by the Biddeford, which had also compelled her antagonist to give way, and pursued her till she was out of sight. In about an hour after the action began, captain Skinner was killed by a cannon▪ball; and the com∣mand devolved to lieutenant Knollis, son to the earl of Banbury †, who maintained the battle with great spirit, even after he was wounded, until he received a second shot in his body, which proved mortal. Then the master assuming the direction, continued the engagement with equal resolution, until the enemy made his escape, which he the more easily accomplished as the Biddeford was disabled in her masts and rigging.</P>

These stout Hibernians immediately formed a plan of insurrection, and executed it with success. Four of the French mariners being below deck, three aloft among the rigging, one at the helm, and another walking the deck, Brian, who headed the enterprize, tripped up the heels of the French steersman, seized his pistol, and discharged it at him who walked the deck; but missing the mark, he knocked him down with the butt end of the piece. At the same time hollowing to his confe∣derates below, they assailed the enemy with their own broad swords; and soon compelling them to submit, came upon deck, and shut the hatches. Brian being now in possession of the quarter deck, those who were aloft called for quarter, and sur∣rendered without opposition. The Irish having thus obtained a complete victory, almost without bloodshed, and secured the prisoners, another dif∣ficulty occurred: neither Brian nor any of his asso∣ciates could read or write, or knew the least prin∣ciple of navigation; but, supposing his course to be north, he steered at a venture, and the first land he made was the neighbourhood of Youghall, where he happily arrived with his prisoners.</P>

All her offi∣cers and men, amounting to seven hundred, pe∣rished on this occasion, except one midshipman and twenty five mariners, who had the good for∣tune to save themselves by leaping on the rocks, as the hull was thrown forwards, and raised up by the succeeding billows.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with the Chero∣kees.</NOTE> We shall now transport the reader to the conti∣nent of North America, which, as the theatre of war, still maintained its former importance. The French emissaries from the province of Louisiana had exercised their arts of insinuation with such success among the Cherokees, a numerous and powerful nation of Indians, settled on the confines of Virginia and Carolina, that they had infringed the peace with the English towards the latter end of the last year, and begun hostilities by plunder∣ing, massacring, and scalping several British sub∣jects of the more southern provinces. Mr. Lyttel∣ton, governor of South Carolina, having received
<PB N="399" REF="4240"/>
information of these outrages, obtained the neces∣sary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> aids from the assembly of his province, for maintaining a considerable body of forces, which was raised with great expedition. He marched in the beginning of October at the head of eight hun∣dred provincials, reinforced with three hundred regular troops, and penetrated into the heart of the country possessed by the Cherokees, who were so much intimidated by his vigour and dispatch, that they sent a deputation of their chiefs to sue for peace, which was re-established by a new treaty, dictated by the English governor. They obliged themselves to renounce the French interest; to de∣liver up all the spies and emissaries of that nation, then resident among them; to surrender to justice those of their own people, who had been concerned in murdering and scalping the British subjects; and for the performance of these articles two and twen∣ty of their head men were put as hostages into the hands of the governor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Treaty of Peace and Friendship concluded by his Excellency <HI>William-Henry Lyttelton,</HI> Esq; Captain-General, and Governor in Chief of His Majesty's Provinces of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> with <HI>Attakulla∣kulla,</HI> or, <HI>The Little Car∣penter,</HI> Deputy of the whole <HI>Cherokee</HI> Nation, and other Headmen and Warriors there∣of, at <HI>Fort Prince George, Dec. 26, 1759.</HI></P>

<PB N="402" REF="4270"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> delivering up some murderers: but the command∣ing officer, perceiving some suspicious circumstances in their behaviour, acted with such vigilance and circumspection as intirely frustrated their design <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This attempt was con∣ducted in the following man∣ner, having doubtless been concerted with the two and twenty hostages, who resided in the fort. On the sixteenth day of February, two Indian women appearing at Keowee, on the other side of the river, Mr. Dogharty, one of the of∣ficers of the fort, went out to ask them what news. While he has engaged in conversa∣tion with these females, the great Indian warrior Oucon∣nostata joining them, desired he would call the command∣ing officer, to whom he said he had something to propose. Accordingly lieutenant Coty∣more appearing, accompa∣nied by ensign Bell, Doghar∣ty, and Forster the interpre∣ter▪ Ouconnostata told him he had something of consequence to impart to the governor, whom he purposed to visit, and desired he might be at∣tended by a white man, as a safeguard. The lieutenant assuring him he should have a safeguard, the Indian declared he would then go and catch a horse for him; so saying, he swung a b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le thrice over his head, as a signal, and imme∣diately twenty-five or thirty muskets, from different am∣buscades, were discharged at the English officers. Mr. Co∣tymore received a shot in his left breast, and in a few days expired; Mr. Bell was wound∣ed in the calf of the leg, and the interpreter in the but∣tock. Ensign Milne, who re∣mained in the fort, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sooner informed of this trea∣chery, than he ordered the soldiers to shackle the hos∣tages; in the execution of which order one man was killed upon the spot, and another wounded in the fore∣head with a tomahawk: cir∣cumstances which added to the murder of the lieutenant, incensed the garrison to such a degree, that it was judged absolutely necessary to put the hostages to death without further hesitation. In the evening a party of Indians approaching the fort, and firing two signal pieces, cri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d aloud in the Cherokee lan∣guage, "Fight manfully▪ and you shall be assisted." Then they began an attack, and continued firing all night upon the fort, without doing the least execution. That a design was concerted between them and the hostages, ap∣peared plainly from the na∣ture of this assault; and this supposition was converted in∣to a certainty next day, when some of the garrison searching the apartment in which the hostages lay, sound a bottle of poison, probably designed to be emptied into the well, and several tomohawks bu∣ried in the earth; which wea∣pons had been privately con∣veyed to them by their friends, who were permitted to visit them without inter∣ruption. On the third day of March, the fort at Ninety-Six was attacked by two hun∣dred Cherokee Indians, with musquetry, which had little or no effect, so that they were forced to retire with some loss, and revenged themselves on the open country, burning and ravaging all the houses and plantations belonging to English settlers in this part of the country, and all along the frontiers of Virginia. Not contented with pillaging and destroying the habita∣tions, they wantoned in the most horrible barbarities; and their motions were so se∣cret and sudden, that it was impossible for the inhabitants to know where the storm would burst, or take proper precautions for their own de∣fence, so that a great number of the back settlements were totally abandoned.</NOTE>.
<PB N="403" REF="4280"/>
Thus disappointed, they wreaked their vengeance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> upon the English subjects trading in their country, all of whom they butchered without mercy. Not contented with this barbarous sacrifice, they made incursions to the British settlements at the Long Lanes, and the forks of the Broad River, and mas∣sacred about forty defenceless colonists, who re∣posed themselves in full security on the peace so lately ratified. As views of interest could not have induced them to act in this manner, and their re∣venge had not been inflamed by any fresh provo∣cation, these violences must be imputed to the instigation of French incendiaries; and too plainly evince the necessity of crowning our American con∣quests
<PB N="404" REF="4290"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> with the reduction of Louisiana, from whence these emissaries were undoubtedly dispatched.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their townsand villages destroyed bycolonel Montgo∣mery.</NOTE> The cruelty and mischief with which the Chero∣kees prosecuted their renewed hostilities, alarmed all the southern colonies of the English; and appli∣cation was made for assistance to Mr. Amherst, the commander in chief of the king's forces in Ame∣rica. He forthwith detached twelve hundred chosen men to South Carolina, under the com∣mand of colonel Montgomery, brother to the earl of Eglinton, an officer of approved conduct, and distinguished gallantry. Immediately after his ar∣rival at Charles-Town, he advanced to Ninety-six, and proceeded to Twelve-Mile River, which he passed in the beginning of June, without opposi∣tion. He continued his route, by forced marches, until he arrived in the neighbourhood of the In∣dian town called Little Keowee, where he en∣camped in an advantageous situation. Having rea∣son to believe the enemy were not yet apprized of his coming, he resolved to rush upon them in the night by surprize. With this view, leaving his tents standing, with a sufficient guard for the camp and waggons, he marched through the woods towards the Cherokee town of Estatoe, at the dis∣tance of five and twenty miles; and in his route detached a company of light infantry to destroy the village of Little Keowee, where they were re∣ceived with a smart fire; but they rushed in with their bayonets, and all the men were put to the sword. The main body proceeded straight to Esta∣toe, which they reached in the morning; but it had been abandoned about half an hour before
<PB N="405" REF="4300"/>
their arrival. Some few of the Indians, who had<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> not time to escape, were slain; and the town, con∣sisting of two hundred houses, well stored with pro∣vision, ammunition, and all the necessaries of life, was first plundered, and then reduced to ashes; some of the wretched inhabitants, who concealed themselves, perishing in the flames. It was neces∣sary to strike a terror into those savages by some examples of severity; and the soldiers became deaf to all the suggestions of mercy, when they found in one of the Indian towns the body of an English∣man, whom they had put to the torture that very morning. Colonel Montgomery followed his blow with surprising rapidity. In the space of a few hours he destroyed Sugar-town, which was as large as Estatoe, and every village and house in the lower nation. The Indian villages in this part of the world were agreeably situated, generally consisting of about one hundred houses, neatly and commo∣diously built, and well supplied with provision. They had in particular large magazines of corn, which were consumed in the flames. All the men that were taken suffered immediate death; but the greater part of the nation had escaped with the utmost precipitation. In many houses the beds were yet warm, and the tables spread with victuals. Many loaded guns went off while the houses were burning. The savages had not time to save their most valuable effects. The soldiers found some money, three or four watches, a good quantity of wampum, cloaths, and peltry. Colonel Montgo∣mery, having thus taken vengeance on the perfi∣dious Cherokees, at the expence of five or six men
<PB N="406" REF="4310"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> killed or wounded, returned to fort Prince George, with about forty Indian women and children whom he had made prisoners. Two of their warriors were set at liberty, and desired to inform their na∣tion, that, though they were now in the power of the English, they might still, on their submission, enjoy the blessing of peace. As the chief, called Attakullakulla, alias the Little Carpenter, who had signed the last treaty, disapproved of the proceedings of his countrymen, and had done many good offices to the English since the renovation of the war, he was now given to understand, that he might come down with some other chiefs to treat of an accom∣modation, which would be granted to the Cherokees on his account; but that the negotiation must be begun in a few days, otherwise all the towns in the upper nation would be ravaged and reduced to ashes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His expe∣dition to the mid∣dle settle∣ments.</NOTE> These intimations having produced little or no effect, colonel Montgomery resolved to make a se∣cond irruption into the middle settlements of the Cherokees, and began his march on the twenty-fourth day of June. On the twenty-seventh cap∣tain Morison, of the advanced party, was killed by a shot from a thicket, and the firing became so troublesome that his men gave way. The grena∣diers and light infantry being detached to sustain them, continued to advance, notwithstanding the fire from the woods, until, from a rising ground, they discovered a body of the enemy. These they immediately attacked, and obliged to retire into a swamp, which, when the rest of the troops came up, they were, after a short resistance, comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to abandon: but as the country was difficult, and

the path extremely narrow, the forces suffered on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> their march from the fire of scattered parties, who concealed themselves behind trees and bushes. At length they arrived at the town of Et<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>howee, which the inhabitants had forsaken, after having removed every thing of value. Here, while the army en∣camped on a small plain surrounded by hills, it was incommoded by vollies from the enemy, which wounded some men, and killed several horses. They were even so daring as to attack the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quet∣guard, which repulsed them with difficulty; but generally speaking, their parties declined an open engagement. Colonel Montgomery sensible, that as many horses were killed or disabled, he could not proceed farther without leaving his provisions be∣hind, or abandoning the wounded men to the brutal revenge of a savage enemy, resolved to return, and began his retreat in the night, that he might be the less disturbed by the Indians. Accordingly he pursued his route for two days without interrup∣tion; but afterwards sustained some straggling fires from the woods, though the parties of the enemy were put to flight as often as they appeared.

In consequence of this treaty the garrison evacuated the fort, and had marched about fifteen miles on their return to Ca∣rolina, when they were surrounded and surprised by a large body of Indians, who massacred all the officers, except captain Stuart, and slew five and twenty of the soldiers: the rest were made pri∣soners, and distributed among the different towns and villages of the nation.

He repaired the old works, established posts of communication from the Ohio to the Mo∣nongahela, mounted the bastions that cover the isthmus with artillery, erected casemates, store∣houses, and barracks for a numerous garrison, and cultivated with equal diligence and success the friendship and alliance of the Indians. The happy consequences of these measures were soon apparent in the production of a considerable trade between the natives and the merchants of Pittsburgh, and in the perfect security of about four thousand set∣tlers, who now returned to the quiet possession of the lands, from whence they had been driven by the enemy, on the frontiers of Pensylvania, Mary∣land, and Virginia.</P>

General Murray neglected no step that could be taken by the most vigilant offi∣cer for maintaining the important conquest of Que∣bec, and subduing all the Lower Canada, the inha∣bitants of which actually submitted, and took the oath of allegiance to the king of Great Britain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The garrison of Quebec, during the winter, repaired above five hundred houses, which had been damaged by the English cannon, built eight redoubts of wood, raised foot-banks along the ram∣parts, opened embrasures, mounted artillery, blocked up all the avenues of the sub∣urbs with a stockade, re∣moved eleven months provi∣sions into the highest part of the city, and formed a maga∣zine of four thousand fascines. Two hundred men were post∣ed at St. Foix, and twice the number at Lorette. Several hundred men marched to St. Augustin, brought off the enemy's advanced guard, with a great number of cattle, and disarmed the inhabitants. By these precautions the motions of the French were observed, the avenues of Quebec were covered, and their dominion secured over eleven parishes, which furnished them with some fresh provision and other necessaries for subsistence. Sixteen thousand cords of wood, being wanted for the hospitals, guards, and quar∣ters, and the method of tran∣sporting it from the isle of Orleans, being found slow and difficult, on account of the floating ice in the river, a sufficient number of hand sledges were made, and two hundred wood-fellers set at work in the forest of St. Foix, where plenty of fuel was ob∣tained, and brought into the several regiments by the men that were not upon duty. A detachment of two hundred men, being sent to the other side of the river, disarmed the inhabitants, and com∣pelled them to take the oath of allegiance: by this step the English became masters of the southern side of the St. Laurence, and were sup∣plied with good quantities of fresh provision. The ad∣vanced posts of the enemy were established at Point au Tremble, St. Augustin, and Le Calvaire: the main body of their army quartered be∣tween Trois Rivieres and Jaques Quartier. Their ge∣neral having formed the de∣sign of attacking Quebec in the winter, began to provide snow shoes, or rackets, scal∣ing-ladders, and fascines, and make all the necessary pre∣parations for that enterprize. He took possession of Point Levi, where he formed a ma∣gazine of provisions, great part of which, however, sell into the hands of the English; for as soon as the river was froze over, brigadier Murray dispatched thither two hun∣dred men, at whose approach the enemy abandoned their magazine, and retreated with great precipitation. Here the detachment took post in a church, until they could build two wooden redoubts, and mount them with artillery, In the mean time, the ene∣my returning with a greater force to recover the post, some battalions, with the light infantry, marched over the ice, in order to cut off their communication; but they fled in great confusion, and afterwards took post at St. Michael, at a considerable distance farther down the ri∣ver. They now resolved to postpone the siege of Quebec, that they might carry it on in a more regular manner. They began to rigg their ships, repair their small craft, build gallies, cast bombs and bullets, and prepare fascines and gabions; while briga∣dier Murray employed his men in making preparations for a vigorous defence. He sent out a detachment, who surprized the enemy's posts at St Augustin, Maison Bru∣lee, and Le Calvaire, where they took ninety prisoners. He afterwards ordered the light infantry to possess and fortify Cape Rouge to pre∣vent the enemy's landing at that place, as well as to be nearer at hand to observe their motions; but when the frost broke up, so that their ships could fall down the ri∣ver, they landed at St Au∣gustin, and the English posts were abandoned one after another, the detachments re∣tiring without loss into the city.</NOTE>.

<PB N="413" REF="4380"/>
insomuch that, before the end of April, one thou∣sand<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> soldiers were dead of the scurvy, and twice that number rendered unfit for service. Such was the situation of the garrison, when Mr. Murray received undoubted intelligence, that the French commander, the chevalier de Levis, was employed in assembling his army, which had been cantoned in the neighbourhood of Montreal; that from the inhabitants of the country he had completed his eight battalions, regimented forty companies of the troops de colonie, and determined to under∣take the siege of Quebec, whenever the river St. Laurence should be clear of ice; that he could use his four frigates, and other vessels, by means of which he was intirely master of the river.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brigadier Murray resolves to give them battle.</NOTE> The brigadier, considering the city of Quebec as no other than a strong cantonment, had pro∣jected a plan of defence, by extending lines, and intrenching his troops on the heights of Abraham, which, at the distance of eight hundred paces, in∣tirely command the ramparts of the city, and might have been defended by a small force against a for∣midable army. Fascines, and every other necessary for this work, had been provided, and in the month of April the men were set at work upon the projected lines; but the earth was so hardened by the frost, that it was found impracticable to pro∣ceed. Being informed, on the night of the twenty-sixth, that the enemy had landed at Point a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tremble, to the number of ten thousand men, with five hundred savages, he ordered all the bridges over the river Caprouge to be broke down, secured the landing-places at Sylleri and the Foulon; and
<PB N="414" REF="4390"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> next day, marching in person with a strong detach∣ment and two field-pieces, took possession of an advantageous situation, and thus defeated the scheme which the French commander had laid for cutting off the posts which the English had estab∣lished. These being all withdrawn, the brigadier that same afternoon marched back to Quebec, with little or no loss, altho' his rear was harrassed by the enemy. Here he formed a resolution which hath been cen∣sured by some critics in war, as a measure that sa∣voured more of youthful impatience and overboil∣ing courage, than of that military discretion which ought to distinguish a commander in such a delicate situation; but it is more easy to censure with an appearance of reason, than to act in such cir∣cumstances with any certainty of success. Mr. Murray, in his letter to the secretary of state, de∣clares, that although the enemy were greatly su∣perior to him in number, yet, when he considered that the English forces were habituated to victory, that they were provided with a fine train of field∣artillery, that, in shutting them up at once within the walls, he should have risqued his whole stake on the single chance of defending a wretched for∣tification; a chance which could not be much les∣sened by an action in the field, though such an ac∣tion would double the chance of success: for these reasons he determined to hazard a battle; should the event prove unprosperous, he resolved to hold out the place to the last extremity; then to retreat to the isle of Orleans, or Coudres, with the re∣mainder of the garrison, and there wait for a rein∣forcement.</P>
<P><PB N="415" REF="4400"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> In pursuance of these resolutions he gave the necessary orders over night, and, on the twenty-eighth<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is worsted, and obli∣ged to retreat into the town.</NOTE> day of April, at half an hour after six in the morning, marched out with his little army of three thousand men, which he formed on the heights in order of battle. The right brigade, commanded by colonel Burton, consisted of the regiments of Amherst, Anstruther, Webb, and the second battalion of Royal Americans: the left, under colonel Fraser, was formed of the regiments of Kennedy, Lascelles, Townshend, and the High∣landers. Otway's regiment, and the third batta∣lion of Royal Americans, constituted the corps de reserve. Major Dalling's corps of light infantry covered the right flank; the left was secured by captain Huzzen's company of rangers, and one hundred volunteers, under the command of cap∣tain Donald Macdonald; and each battalion was supplied with two field-pieces. Brigadier Murray having reconnoitred the enemy, perceived their van had taken possession of the rising grounds about three quarters of a mile in his front; but that their army was on the march in one column. Thinking this was the critical moment to attack them before they were formed, he advanced to∣wards them with equal order and expedition. They were soon driven from the heights, though not without a warm dispute; during which, the body of their army advanced at a round pace, and formed in columns. Their van consisted of ten companies of grenadiers, two of volunteers, and four hundred savages: eight battalions, formed in four columns, with some bodies of Canadians in

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the intervals, constituted their main body: their rear was composed of two battalions and some Ca∣nadians in the flanks; and two thousand Canadians formed the reserve. Their whole army amounted to upwards of twelve thousand men. Major Dalling, with great gallantry, dispossessed their grenadiers of a house and windmill, which they occupied, in order to cover their left-flank; and in this attack the major and some of his officers were wounded; nevertheless, the light infantry pursued the fugi∣tives to a corps which was formed to sustain them; then the pursuers halted, and dispersed along the front of the right; a circumstance which prevented that wing from taking advantage of the first im∣pression they had made on the left of the enemy. The light infantry being ordered to regain the flank, were, in attempting this motion, furiously charged, and thrown into disorder: then they re∣tired to the rear in such a shattered condition, that they could never again be brought up during the whole action. Otway's regiment was instantly or∣dered to advance from the body of reserve, and sustain the right-wing, which the enemy twice in vain attempted to penetrate. Mean while the left brigade of the British forces did not remain inactive: they had dispossessed the French of two redoubts, and sustained with undaunted resolution the whole efforts of the enemy's right, until they were fairly fought down, overpowered by numbers, and reduced to an handful, notwithstanding the as∣sistance they received from the third battalion of Royal Americans, which had been stationed with the body of reserve, as well as from Kennedy's re∣giment

The French attacked<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> with great impetuosity; and, at length, a fresh co∣lumn of the regiment de Rousillon, penetrating the left wing of the British army, it gave way: the disorder was soon communicated to the right, so that, after a very obstinate dispute, which lasted an hour and three quarters, brigadier Murray was obliged to quit the field with the loss of one thou∣sand men killed or wounded, and the greater part of his artillery. The enemy lost twice the num∣ber of men, and reaped no essential advantage from their victory.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quebec b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sieged.</NOTE> Mr. Murray, far from being dispirited by his defeat, no sooner retired within the walls of Que∣bec, than he resolved to prosecute the fortifications of the place, which had been interrupted by the severity of the winter; and the soldiers exerted themselves with incredible alacrity, not only in la∣bouring at the works, but also in the defence of the town, before which the enemy had opened trenches on the very evening of the battle. Three ships anchored at the foulon below their camp; and for several days they were employed in landing their cannon, mortars, and ammunition. Mean while they worked incessantly at their trenches be∣fore the town; and, on the eleventh day of May, opened one bomb battery, and three batteries of cannon. Brigadier Murray made the necessary dispo∣sitions to defend the place to the last extremity: he raised two cavaliers, contrived some outworks, and planted the ramparts with one hundred and thirty-two pieces of artillery, dragged thither mostly by the soldiery. Though the enemy cannonaded the place with great vivacity the first day, their fire

Commodore Swanton, who had sailed from England with a small rein∣forcement, arrived about the beginning of May at the isle of Bec, in the river St. Laurence, where, with two ships, he purposed to wait for the rest of his squad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, which had separated from him in the passage: but one of these, the Lowestoffe, com∣manded by captain Deane, had entered the harbour of Quebec on the ninth day of May, and commu∣nicated to the governor the joyful news that the squadron was arrived in the river.

<P>General Murray therefore has dispersed manifestoes to no purpose, to magnify his own nation, to pacify the Ca∣nadians, to engage them to lay down their arms, to dis∣credit our bills of exchange, and our currency, at the same time that the English traders are eager to procure them, because they have been regu∣larly paid.</P>

His hopes, slender as they were, depended upon the natural strength of the country, rendered almost inaccessible by woods, mountains, and morasses, which might have retarded the progress of the English, and protracted the war, until a general pacification could be effected. In the mean time, major general Amherst was diligently employed in taking measures for the execution of the plan he had projected, in order to complete the conquest of Canada. He conveyed instructions to general Murray, directing him to advance by water towards Montreal, with all the troops that could be spared from the garrison of Quebec. He detached colonel Haviland with a body of troops from Crown point to take possession of the isle aux Noix, in the lake-Champlain, and from thence penetrate the short∣est way to the bank of the river St. Laurence; while he himself, with the main body of the army, amounting to above ten thousand men, including Indians, should proceed from the frontiers of New York, by the rivers of the Mohawks and Oneidas, to the lake Ontario▪ and sail down the river St. Laurence to the isla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Montreal. Thus, on the supposition that all these particulars could be
<PB N="423" REF="4480"/>
executed, the enemy must have been at last<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> hemmed in, and intirely surrounded. In pur∣suance of this plan, general Amherst had provided two armed sloops to cruise in the lake Ontario, un∣der the command of captain Loring; as well as a great number of batteaus, or smaller vessels, for the transportation of the troops, artillery, ammu∣nition, implements, and baggage. Several regi∣ments were ordered to proceed from Albany to Oswego; and the general, taking his departure from Schenectady, with the rest of the forces, in the latter end of June, arrived at the same place on the ninth day of July.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He fails down the St. Lau∣rence, and re∣duces the French fort at isle Royale.</NOTE> Being informed that two French vessels had ap∣peared off Oswego, he dispatched some batteaus to Niagara with intelligence to captain Loring, who immediately set sail in quest of them; but they escaped his pursuit, though they had twice ap∣peared in the neighbourhood of Oswego since the arrival of the general, who endeavoured to amuse them by detaching batteaus to different parts of the lake. The army being assembled, and joined by a considerable body of Indians under the com∣mand of Sir William Johnson, the general detached colonel Haldemand with the light infantry, the grenadiers, and one battalion of highlanders, to take post at the bottom of the lake, and assist the armed vessels in finding a passage to Le Galette. On the tenth day of August the army embarked on board the batteaus and whale boats, and pro∣ceeded on the lake towards the mouth of the river St. Laurence. Understanding that one of the enemy's vessels had run a▪ground and was disabled,
<PB N="4$4" REF="4490"/>

On the seventeenth the row∣gallies fell in with the French sloop commanded by Mr. de la Broquerie, who surrendered after a warm engagement. Mr. Amherst having detached some en∣gineers to reconnoitre the coasts and islands in the neighbourhood of Isle Royale, he made a disposi∣tion for the attack of that fortress, which was ac∣cording invested, after he had taken possession of the islands. Some of these the enemy had aban∣doned with such precipitation, as to leave behind a few scalps they had taken on the Mohawk river, a number of tools and utensils, two swivels, some barrels of pitch, and a large quantity of iron. The Indians were so incensed at sight of the scalps, that they burned a chapel, and all the houses of the ene∣my. Batteries being raised on the nearest islands, the fort was cannonaded not only by them, but likewise by the armed sloops; and a disposition was made for giving the assault, when Mr. Pouchaut the governor thought proper to beat a parley, and surrender on capitulation. The general, having taken possession of the fort, found it so well situated for commanding the lake Ontario, and the Mo∣hawk river, that he resolved to maintain it with a garrison, and employed some days in repairing the fortifications.</P>

On the sixth day of September the troops were landed on the island of Montreal <NOTE PLACE="marg">He lands on the island of Mont∣real.</NOTE> without any opposition, except from some flying parties, which exchanged a few shot, and then fled with precipitation. That same day he repaired a bridge which they had broke down in their retreat, and, after a march of two leagues, formed his army on a plain before Montreal, where they lay all night on their arms. Montreal is, in point of im∣portance, the second place in Canada, situated in an island of the river St. Laurence, at an equal distance from Quebec and the lake Ontario. Its central situation rendered it the staple of the Indian trade; yet the fortifications of it were incon∣siderable, not at all adequate to the value of the place.</P>

The terms of the capitulation may perhaps be thought rather too favourable, as the enemy were actually inclosed, and destitute of all hope of relief: but little points like these ought to be always sacrificed to the consideration of great objects; and the finishing the conquest of a great country, without bloodshed, redounds as much to the honour as it argues the humanity of general Amherst, whose conduct had been irreproachable during the whole course of these American opera∣tions. At the same time, it must be allowed he was extremely fortunate in having subordinate commanders, who perfectly corresponded with his ideas, and a body of troops whom no labours could discourage, whom no dangers could dismay. Sir William Johnson, with a power of authority and insinuation peculiar to himself, not only maintained a surprising ascendency over the most ferocious of all the Indian tribes, but kept them within the bounds of such salutary restraint, that not one single act of inhumanity was perpetrated by them during the whole course of this expedition. The zeal and conduct of brigadier-general Gage; the undaunted spirit and enterprising genius of general Murray; the diligence and activity of colonel Ha∣viland; happily co-operated in promoting this great event.</P>

He that knowingly ministers to these ends is a dangerous tool, and an abandoned prostitute: but the most conscientious historian may be betrayed into calumny by misinformation, and hurried into mistake by precipitation or inad∣vertency. The only atonement which he can make for these involuntary errors, is to retract them, upon conviction, in such a manner as to un∣deceive the reader whom he has unknowingly mis∣led, and healing the wounds which he had unwit∣tingly inflicted. Thus the injured person will have reason to be satisfied, and the public will forgive the writer's errors, in consideration of his inte∣grity. Actuated by these motives and sentiments, we with pleasure embrace this opportunity of making reparation for an unintentional injury we have done to a worthy patriot, in the fourth volume of the Complete History of England. In page

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1760.</NOTE> 575, of the quarto edition, in recording the scheme of Sir John Barnard for raising money, either by the sale of annuities, or by borrowing at an interest not exceeding three per centum, to be applied towards redeeming the South sea annuities; we have inadvertently misrepresented the character of alderman Heatl cote, by saying, "This scheme was violenty opposed by alderman Heathcote, and <HI>other</HI> partisans of the ministry." Conscious of the injury we have done that gentleman, by blending him with such unpopular society, we think it our duty to declare, upon better information, that al∣derman Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hcote, far from being a partisan of any ministry, always distinguished h mself in par∣liament by a constant and uniform opposition to a l ministerial measures, which tended to the pre∣judice or dishonour of the nation; and ever ap∣proved himself an honest, resolute, and zealous as∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtor of the rights and liberties of the people. Indeed, his independency of spirit, his integrity, ability, and love for his country, could not have a more honourable and convincing testimonial than the warm, affectionate, and ample acknowledg∣ment of the court of aldermen and common coun∣cil of the city of London, who, when he begged leave to resign his gown, expressed their entire ap∣probation of the diligent, faithful, and honest dis∣charge of the several great and important trusts they had reposed in him, both as their representa∣tive in parliament, and in bearing successively all the great offices of the city. That he opposed Sir John Barnard's scheme is certainly true; and as, upon this singular occasion, his sentiments hap∣pened
<PB N="443" REF="4680"/>
to be espoused by the ministry, it is a justice<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> we owe Mr. Heathcote to recapitulate some of the arguments he used to enforce them, against the execution of a project which he thought cruel in regard to individuals, and prejudicial with respect to the community. He observed, that a reduction of the interest would distress people of small for∣tunes invested in the funds, especially those, of both sexes, who were bred to no employment, and incapable of business; for they could not employ their money to better advantage in commerce, which was already overstocked. "Trade (he said) was like a tract of pasture ground, which would maintain a certain number of cattle; but if that number was doubled, the whole must starve." He launched out into a detail of particulars. He took notice, that those who engaged in commerce, upon small capitals, must be utterly undone, with∣out the assistance of foreign commissions, which would always be confined to a few hands: that the foreign markets were already overstocked with commodities, supplied not only by British mer∣chants, but also by their rivals of France, who could afford to undersel the English traders, be∣cause they were less encumbered with heavy taxes and high duties: that, in the most advantageous branches of traffick, no merchant could gain above five per centum per annum upon any adventure; for although goods sent to Lisbon would sell for a profit of twenty-five pounds per centum, yet the risques he must run, and the length of time he must wait for payment, would reduce his profit even to common interest; for he would be ex∣posed
<PB N="444" REF="4690"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> to a double hazard of the seas, first to Lis∣bon, and then to Brasil; and likewise to the dan∣gers of a double credit, first of the merchants in Lisbon, and afterwards of their correspondents in the West Indies: that as men of small capitals could not afford to lie so long out of their money, and must be ruined by small losses, they would avoid engaging in commerce under such disadvan∣tages, and, rather than starve at home, remove themselves and their little fortunes into some other country, where, though the security might not be so good, the interest was much higher: thus the nation would be at once deprived of its subjects, and drained of its money: that, by vesting their property in the French funds, they could draw an interest of six per centum, and would probably fix their own habitation where their fortune is depo∣sited; especially when this motive would be rein∣forced by other powerful considerations, such as the cheapness of living in France, the agreeable climate, the gaiety and good humour of the inha∣bitants: that the Dutch, who were tempted to embark their money in the English funds, for the sake of reaping better interest than they could make in Holland, would gradually withdraw that money, when the interest should be reduced so low as to be insufficient for defraying the expence of commission, brokerage, and transfers, besides the risque of correspondents; by which means the price of stock would sink so low, that they might gradually purchase again at such a discount as would amply indemnify them for the reduction of the former interest: thus the nation would an∣nually
<PB N="445" REF="4700"/>
pay them as much interest as before, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> be as much more in their debt, as their capital would be now increased. He reminded the house, that they represented not only the landed, but also the monied interest, and both were equally inti∣tled to their protection; that though the reduction of interest might prove beneficial to the landed in∣terest, which comprehended the greater number, that benefit could not justify their distressing the lesser number; that nothing could justify their sa∣crificing the few to the many, but such a national necessity as did not then exist: that, if the sinking fund had been kept sacred for the purposes for which it was originally designed, great part of the national debt must have been already payed off, and in a few years the whole would be discharged; that it was still sufficient for the purpose, should it be conscientiously applied for the future: that the present scheme, instead of contributing to the dis∣charge of the national debt, would only afford a larger sinking fund for enabling some minister to extend the system of c—n, and prosecute with more eagerness and effect those continental views so foreign and destructive to the true interest of Great Britain. Finally, he undertook to demon∣strate, that the reduction of interest, far from proving beneficial to the landed interest, would oblige the land-holders to mortgage greater parts of their estates, for portioning their younger chil∣dren, than was necessary at present; and likewise to retrench in their manner of living: a circum∣stance that would necessarily▪lessen the consump∣tion of what the lands produced, and, by affecting
<PB N="446" REF="4710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> the tenant, of consequence diminish the value of the estate. Whether these arguments were conclu∣sive we shall not pretend to determine: in some instances it must be allowed his predictions were verified. The high interest given abroad hath tempted several subjects of Great Britain to trust large sums of money in the funds of France; and if this example, exhibited by individuals of im∣mense wealth, hath not been followed by persons of narrow fortunes, on whom the temptation might be supposed to have a greater effect, their hesitation may be imputed to the intervention of two succes∣sive wars, which have broke out and been main∣tained with such animosity between the two na∣tions. With respect to the sinking fund, so con∣siderably increased by the reduction of interest, we do not find that Mr. Heathcote was much mistaken in his prognostic, touching the application of that sacred deposit. As for the Dutch adventurers, the sudden sinking of the English stocks has not only prevented them from selling out at a large dis∣count, but also invited them to purchase more ca∣pital, upon which they have gained a very conside∣rable interest; and this, in all probability, will be added to the debt which England already owes to their country.</P>
<P>Having thus granted all the reparation in our power to alderman Heathcote, we shall act with the same candour towards commodore Moore, commander of the British squadron at the Leeward inslands, who complains that his conduct had been, in some particulars, misrepresented in our account of the expedition to Martinique and Guadalupe.

In the present case we consider it as an act of humanity, as well as justice, when we re∣flect upon the peculiar cruelty which is manifested in aspersing the character of an officer, at the very time while he is exerting all his faculties, and even exposing his life, in the service of his country, at such a distance from the tribunal before which he is arraigned, that, far from being able to vindicate his conduct, he does not even hear of the imputa∣tion, until it shall have made such an impression as even the clea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t evidence of truth cannot intire∣ly eraze.</P>

"He gave the commodore to under∣stand, that he could not maintain his ground, un∣less the squadron would supply him with heavy cannon, landed near the town of Port Royal."—The general having desired that the cannon might be landed at a savannah, where the boats must have been greatly exposed to the fire of the ene∣my,
<PB N="449" REF="4740"/>
which would have rendered the service imprac∣ticable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> according to the opinions of the pilots and captains, given in a council of war held for that purpose, Mr. Moore communicated these opi∣nions to the general; but at the same time offered to land the cannon on the other side of Point Ne∣gro, at a place equally near the road from the Eng∣lish army to Fort Royal, and even cause them to be drawn up by the seamen, without giving any trouble to the troops. The general, instead of embracing this proposal, sent a second message to the commodore, desiring the troops might be reimbarked as soon as possible; and this service Mr. Moore performed with reluctance.</P>
<P>P. 135, "The majority of the British offi∣cers who constituted the council of war, having given their opinion, that it might be for his ma∣jesty's service to make an attack upon St. Pierre, the fleet proceeded to that part of the island."—This council of war, at which the commodore did not assist, was held to deliberate upon the opinion of the chief engineer, and some other officers, who thought they▪ should make another landing to the southward of the Carenage. On this occasion the pilots being examined, declared, that should the troops land to the southward, it would be extremely difficult, if not impracticable, for the fleet to keep up a communication with the army; that the ships in turning up would be exposed to the fire of Fort Royal, Pidgeon Island, and another battery; and afterwards must have lain at the distance of three miles from the landing-place. Notwithstanding these objections, Mr. Moore offered to make the
<PB N="450" REF="4750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1750.</NOTE> attempt, if the general officers thought a commu∣nication at that distance could be kept up to their satisfaction, as is proved by his letter to general Hopson on that subject.</P>
<P>P. 135, "The commodore told the general, that he made no doubt of being able to reduce the town of St. Pierre: but as the ships might be disabled in the attack, so as not to be in a condi∣tion to proceed immediately on any other material service; as the troops might also be reduced in their number, so as to be incapable of future at∣tacks; and as the reduction of the island of Gua∣dalupe would be of great benefit to the sugar∣colonies, Mr. Moore proposed, that the armament should immediately proceed to this island."—To these reasons the commodore added many others of equal importance. His proposal of turning their force against Guadalupe was suggested by his desire of doing service to his country, and honour to the arms of his sovereign: aims which could not be accomplished by an attack on St. Pierre, because, if it had been taken, it could not be garrisoned <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The general was in doubt of being able to garrison it, because the town was com∣manded by the hills, from whence the enemy, unannoy¦ed, might continually harra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the troops.</NOTE>, and consequently this at∣chievement could not have contributed to the reduction of Martinique; but had the ships been disabled in this service, it might have frustrated their design upon Guadalupe, the conquest of which was an object of much greater importance.</P>
<P>Id. ibid. "Besides, Martinique was an object of greater importance than Guadalupe."—Marti∣nique
<PB N="451" REF="4760"/>
is important only as being the seat of go∣vernment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> The produce of it is not comparable to that of Guadalupe. This was a circumstance well known to Mr. Moore; who was also sensible, that the French privateers were chiefly equipped at Guadalupe, by the assistance of their neighbours the Dutch, settled on the island of St. Eustatia. He considered, that Martinique being at a much greater distance from that island, his cruisers might the better interrupt their commerce; and it ap∣pears, from the French memorial, this was done ef∣fectually; so that the privateers of Martinique would have been almost suppressed, had not the French of that island been supplied with provi∣sions and stores by the people of B—s. The conduct of the commodore, in keeping some cruisers always employed to prevent this scandalous traffick, brought upon him the implacable resent∣ment of those who had found their advantage in this correspondence with the enemies of their coun∣try: hence those envenomed arrows of calumny, that were so plentifully discharged against his cha∣racter.</P>
<P>P. 136, "Before the resolution of proceeding to Guadalupe was taken, the commodore had or∣dered the bay to be founded, and directed the Rippon to advance and silence a battery, situated a mile and half to the northward of St. Pierre: accordingly captain Harman, who commanded the ship, stood in; and, anchoring close to the shore, attacked it with such impetuosity, that in a few minutes it was abandoned."—Commodore Moore, as a previous step to the disembarkation of the
<PB N="452" REF="4770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> troops, sent the Rippon to demolish a small fort at the end of an intrenchment, which could have been flanked by the ships when this battery was silenced. Captain Jekyll (not captain Harman) commanded the Rippon, and executed his orders in a few minutes. The damage he sustained was from one or two small batteries on the side of the hill, at some distance from the sea-side, which had not been perceived: but the Rippon was called of by the commodore, as soon as that step could be taken with propriety.</P>
<P>P. 137, "The British squadron having arrived at Basseterre, a council of war was held on board of the commodore's ship; where it was resolved to make a general attack by sea upon the citadel, the town, and other batteries by which it was de∣fended."—There was no council of war held upon this occasion. The commodore, being well ac∣quainted with the place, made a disposition for the attack, from which he would not be diverted by the opinion of the chief engineer, and other offi∣cers, who, after having reconnoitred the fortifica∣tions, declared they thought them impregnable to shipping—as appears from Mr. Moore's letter to the secretary of state.</P>

<PB N="453" REF="4780"/>
after having made a proper disposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> shifted his broad pendant on board the Woolwich of forty guns, as well to direct and keep the transports together in a proper posture for landing with the first opportunity, as to cover the disem∣barkation; and also to consult proper measures with the general, who saw the necessity of Mr. Moore's being with him, and requested that he, with the other general officers and engineers, might be admitted on board the Woolwich, in order to consult, and take the earliest opportunity of land∣ing the troops, as the service necessarily required. That this was a judicious measure, appeared in the consequence. Above fifty different signals were made from the Woolwich to the transports, by which they were kept together, so as to be ready to land at an hour's notice. At noon the commodore, having spied a proper opportunity, proposed to stand in, and land them a little to the northward of the town; but this motion was not approved by the general officers. At three in the afternoon he repeated his offer, assuring them he could per∣form the service at that time, though the firing had not ceased; and expressing his fears, that, if the disembarkation should be delayed much longer, the opportunity for that night would be lost, as the transports were liable to be separated by dif∣ferent veins of wind from the hills, and the va∣rious outsets from the bay. This second repre∣sentation produced no effect: but in the twilight the general desired he would provide boats for six hundred men, at the head of whom colonel Cla∣vering was ready to land, and take post on the
<PB N="454" REF="4790"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> island. After having observed that they laid him under great difficulty by requesting that so late in the evening, which might have been granted so easily when it was first proposed, he took his mea∣sures with such expedition and success, that in less than an hour the troops were rendezvoused under the Woolwich's stern, when the landing was again postponed; though the evening was favourable, the Woolwich at that time very near the shore, and the Spy sloop within her, almost close to the beach. In consequence of this delay, it was found extremely difficult to dispose of the men for the night, as it would have been impossible for them to find their respective transports in the dark: but this difficulty was surmounted by the commodore, who distributed them among the ships of war. Several vessels, set on fire by the enemy, being seen driving about, Mr. Moore, with the transports, kept to windward all night, in such a situation as to be able to chuse his anchorage next day. At the same time he directed the bomb∣ketches to play upon the town to amuse the ene∣my, and keep them at a distance, that the troops might land next morning without opposition.</P>
<P>P. 139, ▪In the mean time, the captain (of the Rippon) threw out a signal of distress, to which no regard was paid, till captain Leslie of the Bristol, coming from sea, and observing his situa∣tion, ran in between the Rippon and the battery."—The Rippon was not more exposed than any other ship. There was no signal of distress seen by any person on board the Woolwich; and, if there had, there was no occasion for an order to the cap∣tain

<P>P. 140, "In the morning, at day-break, the enemy appeared, to the number of two thousand, about four miles from the town, and began to throw up intrenchments in the neighbourhood of a house where the governor had fixed his head∣quarters, declaring he would maintain his ground to the last extremity. To this resolution, indeed, he was encouraged by the nature of the ground, and the neighbourhood of a pass called the Dos d'Ane, a cleft through a mountainous ridge, opening a communication with Capesterre, a more level and beautiful part of the island. The ascent from Basseterre to this pass was so very steep, and the way so broken and interrupted by rocks and gullies, that there was no prospect of attacking it with success, except at the first landing, when the inhabitants were under the dominion of a pannic."—The enemy threw up no intrenchments in the way to the Dos d'Ane:—the pass was hilly, but very accessible by means of a tolerable road, tho' stony and rugged. When the governor of Guada∣lupe rejected the proposal sent with the flag of truce, the generals would have tried the effect of a second message, which Mr. Moore warmly op∣posed, recommending it to him to second his blow while the enemy were in consternation, and offer∣ing to assist him with the marines who were under his command. This attack he the more strongly recommended, as he knew the nature of the cli∣mate, and foresaw the troops would soon be weak∣ened

Had his advice been taken, in all probability, the conquest of the island would have been finished in a few days; for all or most of the posts which the enemy possessed on the Capesterre side, were fortified after the landing of the English forces: and, whatever may have been said of the bravery of the inhabitants, cer∣tain it is, that, as soon as they were attacked, they abandoned all their posts successively, almost without resistance; nor was there any reason to extol the courage and intrepidity of madam Du∣charmey, who was said to have defended her plan∣tation at the head of her slaves and dependents.</P>
<P>P. 143, "In the mean time, the reduction of the islanders, on the side of Guadalupe, appearing more and more impracticable, the general resolved to transfer the seat of war to the eastern and more fertile part of the island, called Grandeterre, which was defended by a strong battery called Fort Louis. In pursuance of this determination, the great ships were sent round to Grandeterre, in order to reduce this fortification, which they accordingly attacked on the thirteenth day of February."—Mr. Moore detached the Berwick, commanded by captain Harman, with some other ships of the line and bomb-vessels, having on board draughts of ma∣rines and highlanders. He directed them to at∣tack Fort Louis, which they accordingly reduced. They had orders afterwards to cruise all round the island, to prevent the landing of any succours from St. Eustatia, and this service they effectually per∣formed: for the enemy, by their own confession, had no provision in the mountains, nor any sort of
<PB N="457" REF="4820"/>
supply but what they drew from their stores in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> Basseterre. When the marines had taken posses∣sion of Fort Louis, Mr. Moore, at the desire of general Hopson, went on board the Panther, ac∣companied by colonel Clavering, to reconnoitre the coast, and fixed upon a landing-place near Arnouville, where the troops were actually disem∣barked.</P>
<P>P. 145, "The enemy no sooner perceived the coast clear, than they descended from the hills, and endeavoured to take possession of the town: they afterwards erected a battery—in the midst of these hostilities the gallant Debrisay, together with ma∣jor Trollop, one lieutenant, two bombardiers, and several common soldiers, were blown up and pe∣rished by the explosion of a powder magazine."—The town was intirely demolished, except some few houses at the end next Fort Royal; and those that came down were only attracted by curiosity to see the ruins—the enemy had but two cannon, and these were spiked up by those that made a sally from the citadel—when the magazine blew up, Mr. Moore sent ships immediately to the assistance of the fort, which however had sustained very little damage.</P>
<P>P. 145, "In the mean time, commodore Moore having received certain intelligence, that Mon∣sieur de Bompart had arrived at Martinique, with a squadron, consisting of eight sail of the line and three frigates, having on board a whole battalion of Swiss, and some other troops to reinforce the garrisons of the island, he called in his cruisers, and sailed immediately to the bay of Dominique—
<PB N="458" REF="4830"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> for what reason Mr. Moore did not sail imme∣diately to the bay of Port-Royal in Martinique, where he knew the French squadron lay at anchor, we shall not pretend to determine."—The bay of Dominique was the only place in which the com∣modore could rendezvous and unite his squadron. Here he refreshed his men, who were grown sick∣ly, in consequence of subsisting on salt provision: here he had intercourse once or twice a day with general Barrington, by means of small vessels which passed and repassed from one island to the other. By remaining in this situation, he likewise maintained a communication with the English Lee∣ward islands, which being in a defenceless condi∣tion, their inhabitants were constantly soliciting the commodore's protection; and here he supported the army, the commander of which was unwilling that he should remove to a greater distance.—Had he sail∣ed to Port-Royal, he would have found the enemy's squadron so disposed that he could not attack them, unless M. de Bompart had been inclined to hazard an action. Had he come to anchor in the bay, all his cruisers must have been employed in conveying provisions and stores to the squadron. There he could not have procured either fresh pro∣visions or water; nor could he have had communi∣cation with, nor intelligence from the army, or the Leeward islands, in less than eight or ten days.</P>
<P>P. 146, "General Barrington being left with no more than one ship of forty guns, for the protec∣tion of the transports, formed a plan of prose∣cuting the war in Guadalupe by detachments."—
<PB N="459" REF="4840"/>
The commodore could not be said to have lest the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An, 1760.</NOTE> general, inasamuch as the squadron lay almost in sight of Capesterre, and he was at hand to afford either his advice or assistance. His advice he ac∣cordingly gave freely, with respect to the plan for the reduction of Guadalupe, particularly for land∣ing at Arnouville; and it appears from general B—'s letter to this gentleman, that he had done every thing that could be expected from him, for the good of the service.</P>
<P>P. 147, "Colonel Clavering landed with about eighty men, but found himself so intangled with mangrove trees, and the mud so impassably deep, that he was obliged to reimbark."—The com∣modore never dreamed they would attempt land∣ing in this place, knowing that the enemy had driven stakes under water for the destruction of the boats. The inconveniencies of landing here he had represented to the general, before he sailed to Dominique.</P>
<P>Id. ibid. "This project having miscaried, the general detached the same commanders with a de∣tachment of fifteen hundred men, to land in a bay not far from the town of Arnouville, at the bottom of the little Cul de Sac, under the protection of his majesty's ship the Woolwich."—The commodore had pitched upon this as the only place at which the landing could be properly effected, and sent thither the Woolwich to cover the disembarkation."</P>
<P>P. 150. "At the same time col. Crumpe was detached with seven hundred men to the bay of Ma∣haut, where he burned the town and batteries, which he found abandoned, together with a

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> vast quantity of provisions, which had had been brought from the island o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> St. Eustatia."—The commodore employed his cruisers with such effect, that no provisions were landed at Ma∣haut since the first attack of the island. A trader of St. Eustatia offered to supply the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with ten thousand barrels of beef, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> declaring without scruple, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had effectually prevented him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of it at any French market.

<P>P. 152, "The inhabitants had just signed the agreement, when a messenger arrived in their camp, with information that Mr. de Beauharncis, the general of the French islands, had landed at St. Anne's, to the windward, with a reinforcement from Martinique, consisting of six hunderd regu∣lars from Europe, and about two thousand Bucca∣neers, with a great supply of arms and ammuni∣tion, mortars, and artillery, under convoy of the squadron commanded by M. de Bompart, who no sooner learned that the capitulation was signed, than he reimbarked the troops and stores with all possible expedition."—The troops which were landed did not exceed six hundred blacks and
<PB N="461" REF="4860"/>
whites, and these in a wretched condition, so that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> if they had stayed, they might all have been taken prisoners; as Mr. Moore would have gone up and landed his marines on the back of Mr. Beauhar∣nois, who would have found himself between two fires. As for Buccaneers, they existed no where but in imagination. The date of those adventurers expired above fifty years before this period.</P>
<P>P. 158, "Immediately after the capitulation of Guadalupe, he summoned the islands called Santos and Deseada to surrender."—These islands were not summoned till a considerable time after general B—had sailed for England.</P>
<P>Id. ibid. "But his proposal was rejected by the inhabitants of Marigalante—The general resolving to reduce it by force, embarked a body of troops on board of transports, which sailed thither under convoy of three ships of war and two bomb-ves∣sels from prince Rupert's Bay; and at their ap∣pearance, the islanders submitting, received an English garrison."—The commodore sent thither a strong detachment of ships, at whose arrival the inhabitants immediately capitulated.</P>
<P>P. 159, "Before this period, commodore Moore having received intelligence that M. de Bompart had sailed from Martinique, with design to land a reinforcement on Guadalupe, and that his squadron was seen at sea seven leagues to windward of Mari∣galante, he sailed from Prince Rupert's Bay, and turned to windward; but bringing to about noon, he fell to leeward, and lost as much in the day as he gained in the night."—The commodore never brought to but in order to receive letters from ge∣neral

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1760.</NOTE> B—. These he thought it his duty to stay for, as he did not know but his not receiving them, at such a critical juncture, might be attended with bad consequences. He carried a press-sail night and day, with a view of coming up with the French squadron; nor did he neglect any step that could be taken for that purpose. Had he pursued any other course than that which he followed, the French commander might have run into the road of St. Kitt's, and destroyed or taken a great number of merchant-ships, which were then loading with su∣gar for England. Mr. Moore practised every ex∣pedient and stratagem he could devise for bringing M. de Bompart to action. He even sent away part of his squadron out of sight of the inhabitants of Dominique, that they might represent to their friends of Martinique, his force much inferior to what it really was: but this had no effect upon M. de Bompart, who made the best of his way to Cape Francois, on the island of Hispaniola.</P>
<P>P. 160, "General Barrington himself went on board the Roebuck in the latter end of June, and with the transports under convoy of Capt. Hughes, and a small squadron, set sail for Great Britain."—General Barrington sailed a whole month before Captain Hughes took his departure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mistake relating to a bill in parlia∣ment for improv∣ing Lon∣don Bridge.</NOTE> We shall conclude this volume with rectifying another mistake of less importance, which had crept into the fifteenth Number of the Continua∣tion, p. 210, relating to a petition delivered to the house of commons, by several inhabitants of Southwark, in opposition to a bill, intitled, "An act to improve, widen, and enlarge the passage over

No farther notice was taken of the petition, than its being inserted in the printed votes: the bill was, on the motion of Sir John Ph—s, read for the third time, and passed without the least altera∣tion or debate.</P>
<P>P. S. We think it our duty to acquaint the public with our having received intimation, that the incident recorded in the last Number, relating to the murder of one Mrs. Clarke in Buckinghamshire, is a mere fiction of idle petulance, which had gained admittance into all the papers of public intelligence, and was generally believed as a fact.—To impostures of this kind every historian must be necessarily exposed.</P>
