<HEAD>A LETTER TO Mr. <HI>BISSET</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Reverend</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot but expect that your late Re∣marks on Dr. <HI>Sacheveral</HI>'s Sermon, has oc∣casioned various Speculations, in this Cri∣tical Age: Every Man that Prints, Ap∣als to the People who Read, and ought to be con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, to hear them pass their Censures—Nor is it just for <HI>any Man</HI> to Answer, Censure, or Animad∣rt, upon a Printed Paper, provided only that his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swers, Censures or Animadversions, are but emselves to be defended in the Nature of them: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d thus for the Author of <HI>Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. as he eaks to all the World, so he makes them all dges of what he says—Upon this Foundation, I presume a little to Animadvert upon your Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rks, on the Reverend Dr. <HI>Sacheveral</HI>'s Sermon, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ached at the Cathedral Church of <HI>St. Paul</HI>'s, on late Anniversary, for the fifth of <HI>November</HI>—<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d hope you will take it in good Part.</HI></P>
<P>shall pass by all the Satyr you are pleased to let <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Reverend Dr. for <HI>be it</HI> that he was
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
<HI>little</HI> Transported into <HI>some Things,</HI> which yo may call Indecencies: The Scripture Rule you we know, ought to prevail, that we should <HI>not rend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Railing for Railing</HI>—and therefore from a Br∣ther of the same Cloth, the Dr. no doubt, did n expect such Treatment.</P>
<P>Before I begin to Examine your particular R∣marks, which I doubt not in their Order to pro∣most unjust, and Impolitick, give me leave to O∣ject in the first place, against your General—A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this perhaps, will appear as a strong Argument, gainst your real Design in the whole, <HI>viz.</HI> Exposi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Exploding the Doctor's Sermon.</P>
<P>I begin with your Title, in which you call t Doctor's Sermon a <HI>Postilent</HI> Discourse, and speak the SPREADING <HI>Malignity</HI> of it—Now real<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sir in this I think you are very far out, <HI>I hope I will Pardon the Expression</HI> and tho' it be a wro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way of Arguing, to undertake Negatives, yet p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣haps I may in the Sequel of this Sheet, prove <HI>to ye own Satisfaction,</HI> that the Doctor's Sermon had <HI>Malignity</HI> in it, nor was it in the least <HI>Pestilentia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> And as proving an Affirmative of a contrary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ture, proves the Negative by Consequence; so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prove the Dr's Discourse <HI>Honest, Seasonable, Profit</HI> and <HI>Ʋseful,</HI> I question not, but you will Ingenuo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own, I have proved Effectualy, that it is neit <HI>Malignant</HI> or <HI>Pestilential.</HI></P>
<P>But before I begin with this, I must take le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Note a Word or two, of the Character of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sacheveral;</HI> which I shall do, to clear up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Part, <HI>viz. That his Sermon was Honest</HI>—K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then, Sir, that the Reverend Dr. was a Fellow <HI>Magdalen College,</HI> in <HI>Oxford, and that</HI> before he Chosen to St <HI>Mary-Overs</HI> in <HI>Southwark</HI>—W
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was at <HI>Oxford,</HI> he became a Celebrated Preach∣er upon these Publick Occasions—He Preached several Assize Sermons, and always Declared War <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> hung out HIS FLAG of De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance against <HI>Toleration, Occasional Conformity</HI> and <HI>Dissenting</HI>—and being always thus profestly an Enemy to the <HI>Dissenters</HI>—his Sermon was <HI>honest,</HI> t was all of a piece, with his known Practice—<HI>se knew well enough</HI> what was to be expected from him, and therefore I say <HI>it was honest</HI>—No Man was deceived in his Expectation—Nay farther, hey that Invited him, <HI>no doubt,</HI> knew what to ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect, and did expect it, <HI>and for that End Invited</HI> him <HI>o Preach;</HI> and therefore had he failed of his Ordina∣y Method, it had not been <HI>honest</HI> in him, he had Deceived his Employers, and not acted like himself; Nay, I believe I might appeal to your Self, Sir, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou did not expect what you found, when you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eard Dr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> was to Preach—and if you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not have profest your Self Cheated, and Dis∣ppointed, if you had not heard such a Sermon?—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is evident then, the Sermon was most <HI>honest</HI> and <HI>ncere,</HI> that it was a Sermon Preached from the very deart of the Minister Preaching:; <HI>Well would it e with us all, if all the Gentlemen of the Gown, would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith equal sincerity, Preach what they believe, wish, and eartly Profess,</HI> as this Reverend Dr. has done.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, many of the Reverend Clergy at his time, may be as hearty in their Wishes, as this Gentleman, but they do not speak it out so honest∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—<HI>such plain English;</HI> They are so Infected with hat Poisonous Drug, called <HI>Modesty,</HI> that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince Mattters, and do not speak home as the Dr. oes—Indeed I cannot but think, it would be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch better for all Sides, if they would all speak out
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
plainly, and without Disguise—Then the World would know what they mean—They would no need <HI>to be put upon</HI> by any more SHORTEST WAYS, and such Phanatical Tricks, to explain thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meaning—The Dr. has been one, <HI>you see,</HI> tha Dares <HI>be Honest,</HI> and speak what he thinks.</P>
<P>Next I say what the Dr. has said in this Sermon was most Seasonable; and to this I may join th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heads I had separated, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Useful, Profitable, &amp;c. and to make it out, I shall Enquire how it is <HI>Season∣able, Ʋseful,</HI> and <HI>Profitable.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To the <HI>Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Under these Two Heads, I shall go near to An∣swer all your Objections, against the Reveren Dr's Sermon, and consequently Convince you, hope, that you were very much in the wrong, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Remark upon so Excellent a Discourse and especial∣ly to give it such hard Words, as <HI>Malignant</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Pestilent.</HI></P>
<P>And really, Sir, these Words are very Offensive to a great many honest good People; for that the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think you very much wrong the Dr. <HI>to Suggest</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he should Infect any Body; or that <HI>any thing</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Learnedly says, should have the least SPREADING Malignity—but of this hereafter.</P>
<P>I begin with the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> Sir, and I doubt no I <HI>say</HI> to make appear that—what the Reverend Dr has said of them, is both <HI>Ʋseful, Seasonable,</HI> and <HI>Pro∣fitable</HI> to them,—and indeed plain Dealing is use∣ful both to Friend and Enemy—but especially to Enemies, for then they knowwhat they are to trus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to—'Tis like the K. of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Declaration be∣fore
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
his Expedition into <HI>Schonen,</HI> it tells the <HI>Swedes</HI> what they are to expect—Now the Dr. has ho∣nestly told the <HI>Dissenters, what they are to expect</HI> from him, and his Party; he has <HI>Drawn the Sword</HI> at them, and they know their Enemy—and have no more to do, but to prepare for their own De∣fence.</P>
<P>But <HI>you will say,</HI> how is this made <HI>Profitable</HI> to them; it is <HI>useful</HI> to a Man to know an Enemy, and it may be <HI>seasonable</HI> to him to have that Enemy dis∣covered to him; but it cannot be profitable to any Man to have an Enemy at all?</P>
<P><HI>No, No, Sir,</HI> I do not say it is profitable to have an Enemy; but it is always profitable to a Man, or Party of Men, when they have Enemies to have those Enemies <HI>Distracted,</HI> and <HI>Raving;</HI> for that Rage entirely deprives them of the Power of acting, takes away the use of their Reason and gives a ma∣nifest Advantage against them.</P>
<P>'Tis the Subtile, Smiling, Fawning, Wheedling, Cautious Enemy, that is the <HI>Dangerous Enemy;</HI> the Furious, Hasty, Precipitant Enemy, always Splits himself upon the Rocks of his own Passion—and Throws his Cause down the Precipice of his own Rage—This is the Way the <HI>Revelution Princi∣pale,</HI> and the Interest of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in this King∣dom has always been Establisht—and this is the Way they will still be faster, and faster fixt, in their present Liberty: You are so mistaken, Sir, in thinking that Dr. <HI>Sacheveral</HI> has Injur'd the <HI>Dis∣senters;</HI> That upon my Word, I think he has done them most Signal Services all along—I wish you would Consider of one thing, which really is worth your while—I wish it does not appear that this Sermon is another of <HI>DeFoe</HI>'s SHORTEST
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
WAYS, and that the Dr. is in a Plot with the Pha∣naticks, to make the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> appear O∣dious, and Hateful to the World.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, <HI>to Illustrate this Thought,</HI> will you be pleased to look back a little, <HI>as I know you are a Ma∣ster of History,</HI> and do but see, how very recent Transactions, will Confirm the Truth of what I as∣sert—<HI>viz.</HI> that Precipitations have always fixt the Interest they would Destroy, and been the Ruin of the Precipitators.</P>
<P>I need not carry you Back, to Books and Records, tho' our Histories are full of Precedents; every Man's Memory will Furnish him sufficient to this purpose.</P>
<P>In King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Time <HI>Deliberation,</HI> Policy; Wheedling, Bribing, and <HI>Gradual Encroachments,</HI> How did they Insensibly Destroy us?—How had they Imperceptibly Debauch'd the very Principles of Liberty in the Nation? As they had also those of Morality; and had those Measures gone on, <HI>we had been Ruin'd</HI>—But when King <HI>James</HI> came to the Crown, He honestly undeceived us, told us plainly what he meant, what he aim'd at, and what indeed all his Ancestors had aim'd at, <HI>(viz.) Enslaving us</HI>—And this Ruin'd the Party; had King <HI>James</HI> with the Fraud, and Policy of his Elder Brother, gone on closely, and softly, we had all been Ruin'd, and for ought I know, <HI>even Popery it self</HI> might have gone down with us—But thanks be to God, and the King, they took the contrary Method—<HI>Like the Reverend</HI> Dr Sacheverl, HONEST and PLAIN; they shew'd us the whole Plot—<HI>And what then?</HI>—Why then, <HI>it ceased to be a Plot</HI>—and the whole Nation roused to Dethrone him, <HI>that they might be safe:</HI> They Precipitated their King, their
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Popery, their Tyranny, altogether, and threw them Headlong down the Steep Gulph of the Re∣volution.</P>
<P><HI>Come we to the present Reign,</HI> in the beginning they had her Majesties Favour, their good Mistress Indulg'd them, prompted their Zeal for the Church, and gave them the Publick Administration into their Hands; hoping for the Honour and Safety of their Benefactor, they would have gone on <HI>Mildly</HI> and <HI>Gently</HI>—and had they done so but a while, they might have carried all before them—But how did they Mistake her Majesties Word <HI>Zeal,</HI> for Persecution?—How did they refuse their Occa∣sional Bill when offered them by the Lords with <HI>but one Amendiment</HI>—Which they would have been glad of afterwards How did they then Pre∣cipitat their second <HI>Occasional Bill, which still Increas∣ed the Opposition</HI>—Nor could they ever retrieve the first Point, <HI>which they rashly lost,</HI> till at last, they dash'd it in pieces against the Privileges of the House.</P>
<P>Did not Precipitations save the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in this Case?—Were the <HI>Dissenters</HI> able to do any thing for themselves? Did not these State Lunaticks do it all for them?—Why then should any <HI>Dissenter</HI> be Angry when he sees High-Church-men, <HI>Run∣ning Mad?</HI> Has it not always been their Safety? Has it not always lost the High-Church Cause, when the other have been perfectly Passive, and done nothing for themselves?—Let them rave Gentlemen, it certainly prompts the Fever, and such People always <HI>Die Mad.</HI></P>
<P>They tell us a Story, of a Party of <HI>Round-head</HI> Soldiers, who were surprized by a Party of <HI>Cavali∣ers,</HI> and being overpower'd, were like to be worsted—The King's Men Attackt them with these <HI>Vile</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<HI>Expressions, Damn you, Rebel Dog</HI>'s, now <HI>where</HI>'s <HI>your</HI> LORD OF HOSTS: The Officer that Command∣ed the Round Heads hearing it, turns to his Men, cries a loud—<HI>The Day</HI>'s <HI>our own, Boys, the Ene∣my</HI> BLASPHEME—Which so Daunted the o∣thers, and Encouraged his own Men, that he Beat them presently out of the Field, tho he was great∣ly Inferiour in Number.</P>
<P>Do the <HI>High flyers</HI> Rave, do they Blaspheme, never be Troubled at that; then the <HI>Day is your own;</HI> Precipitations, and Hellish Excursions must ruin them; <HI>it ever did do so,</HI> and ever will do so.</P>
<P>If I were a Whig therefore, <HI>as you are Sir,</HI> I would Compliment my Brother <HI>Sacheveral,</HI> upon his doing so much Service to that Interest, and give him publcik Thanks for it; for without ques∣tion they are exceedingly Obliged to him.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is an Age of Plot and Deceit, of <HI>Con∣tradiction</HI> and <HI>Paradox;</HI> and the Nation can hard∣ly know her Friends from her Enemies; Men Swearing to the Government, and wishing it over∣turn'd; <HI>Abjuring</HI> the Pretender, yet earnestly en∣deavouring <HI>to bring him in;</HI> Eating the <HI>Queen</HI>'s Bread, and <HI>Curseing the Donor;</HI> owning the <HI>Succes∣sion,</HI> and wishing the Successors <HI>at the Devil;</HI> mak∣ing the Marriage (UNION) yet endeavouring <HI>the Divorce;</HI> fawning upon the <HI>Toleration,</HI> yet Rail∣ing at <HI>the Liberty</HI>—It is very hard, under all these Masks, to see the true Countenance of any Man—There are more kinds of Hypocrisie, than that of <HI>Occasional Conformity</HI>—and the whole Town seems to look on Way, and row another: Is it not then an advantage, to be Valued, and Prized; and are you not obliged to the Person, <HI>tho' an Ene∣my,</HI> when Openly and Honourably Men throw off
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
their Disguises, and tell us what they are, and what they mean?—<HI>Such Men,</HI> tho' they are indeed Malignant, and Pestilential as you call them, in their Nature, yet they cease to be SPREADING, and the Danger is evited by their setting out their Lights, and giving notice to all People to stand up∣on their Guard against them, to shun and avoid the Contagion.</P>
<P>Secondly for the Church <HI>of</HI> England.</P>
<P>It is very evident, the main End of all the Dis∣guises these People put on, respecting the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> is more particularly to deceive &amp; delude the Mem∣bers <HI>of the Church of England</HI>—Who are of more moderate Principles, to amuse them with Zeal for the Churches Interest, and preswade them, that they only seek just and reasonable Restraints <HI>upon the Dissenters,</HI> and that they may be prevented, bring∣ing <HI>the Church into Danger</HI>—That they are not for abridging them of a Conscientious Liberty, or for restraining them from the Worship of God <HI>their own way,</HI> but only for checking <HI>unlimited Toleration</HI> and crushing their pernicious <HI>Occ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sional Hypocrisie</HI> and the like; and this Mask of Charity and pre∣tended Care of the Church, really deceives a great many honest, well meaning People of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who in their honest Concern for the Church, and possess'd with the Reasonablness of these Demands, <HI>fall in with them,</HI> from meer Prin∣ciples of Zeal for Religion, and Self preservation.</P>
<P>Now, are we not infinitly oblig'd to Dr. <HI>Saceve∣rel</HI> who throws off this Mask, and fairly tels these impos'd-upon Gentlemen, what it is they really mean, rather than what they pretend—Will it not go a great Way to open the Eyes of these honest Church-Men, <HI>think you,</HI> and will they not be easily convinced? We have often told them
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
in vain, that the Safety of the Church, and the re∣straining Hypocrisie were but Pretences of the Par∣ty, but that the real Design was <HI>Hanging and Drowning, the Dissenters,</HI> and sending both Mini∣sters and People to the GALLOWS and the GAL∣LEYS—And they would not believe us—POOR <HI>DE FOE</HI> with his <HI>Shortest Way,</HI> how did they use him, for fathering such a thing upon them, and making the World believe, that <HI>High Flyers</HI> had such bloody Designs? But, <HI>sure thy will believe now they have it from the Pulpit,</HI> from the very Mouth of the Oracle of that Party, and Preach'd up as an indispensable Duty to <HI>draw the Sword</HI> a∣gainst the <HI>Dissenters</HI>—Now they cannot fay they are <HI>slandred:</HI> But it is their profess'd Principle to destroy the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> both Body and Soul—He owns the Design, he summons the Magistrates to <HI>draw the Sword</HI> on them, the Clergy to <HI>curse them</HI>—And from the Pulpit he dooms them <HI>to the De∣vil and his Angels,</HI> that they may not want Com∣pany.</P>
<P><HI>Honestly done, Sir in Truth:</HI> And most unjustly it is that you censure him—<HI>A most obliging Thing,</HI> and the best Step the Reverend Dr. could have ta∣ken, to bring the World to an <HI>Eclaircisment</HI> in the Matter of <HI>High Church</HI> Designs—Now all the moderate Men, all the Men of Principles and Cha∣rity, <HI>in the Church of</HI> England▪ may see whither they were going, and what their warmer Brethren were driving them to under Pretence of the Churches Safety—They may see here, what her Majesty <HI>cast these People off</HI> for, why the Rever∣end Prelates of the Church abandon'd them—Alas, the Queen did not care to have two Mill∣ons of her People deliver'd up <HI>to Distruction</HI>—
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
The Bishops could not think, <HI>without Horrour,</HI> of sending two Millions of their Brethren, professing the same Faith, believing in the same Saviour, and resting on the same Hope, <HI>to the Devil and his An∣gels</HI>—And now all the moderate concientious People in the Church, <HI>who abhor these Principles,</HI> will be convinc'd of the Design, and by Conse∣quence abhor the People.</P>
<P>Wherefore I entreat you Sir, recall your Satyri∣cal Remarks, and make some handsome Apology to the Reverend Doctor for mal-treating him—And when you have done, be pleased to address him in the most obliging Manner possible, with humble and hearty Thanks—And lest you should think your self alone in the solemn Acknow∣ledgment, you have hereby a Commission sent you to give him Thanks in the Name of Abundance of People; first for his Sermon in General, and then for several of the Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Sir, You are to thank him in the Name of the <HI>High Flying</HI> Clergy of the Church, for so bold∣ly speaking from the Pulpit, what they all mean, tho they have not had Courage to express it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the <HI>Jaco∣bites</HI> in the Nation, for so evidently clearing up their Modesty, and proving, that the Danger of <HI>Britain</HI> lies not in the profess'd <HI>Non-Juror</HI>—but in the Allegiance-swearing, Abjuration-taking <HI>High Flyers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the Mo∣derate <HI>Church-men,</HI> for having fairly disbanded them from his Regiment, and acknowledg'd, they are not at all concerned in his Bloody Principles.</P>
<P><HI>Fourtly</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the <HI>Dissen∣ters,</HI> for his abundant Charity, in dooming them
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
all to the Devil and his Angels—But above all, for <HI>leaving them there,</HI> as he says he will; since cer∣tainly had he resolved to go with them, he would have been the greatest Curse of the Company.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Queen-for calling the Union a Mongrel, which is in plain <HI>English,</HI> modestly speaking a Son of a B—;since all People, to the Honour of Her Majesty, know well enough, who was the Mother of the Union.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Church of <HI>England</HI>—for calling her Whore, since he says, Archbishop <HI>Grindal</HI> was one of her Bastards—For False Sons must be understood, as you say to be Bastards, and not Sons.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Bishops, for his charitable Censure of them, and is wonder∣ful, mannerly, and obedient Command to them, to excommunicate all the <HI>Dissenters-</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eightly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the Parlia, ment who have tolerated Treason by Law—since, he says all that dissent from the Church are Tray∣tors to the State.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of all the Re∣verend Clergy of the Church, for making a <HI>Bilings∣gate</HI> of the Pulpit, and setting St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Cathedral on Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> Thank him in the Name of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks in <HI>England,</HI> for so kindly inverting the Order of the Day, and dropping the <HI>Gun-Powder</HI> Plot, a Subject so ungrateful to them, to employ the Day upon so much more suitable a Subject—<HI>Viz.</HI> The real Blowing up the Peace of Protestants.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I presume, you will give the Doctor an Equivalent for the Affront he received at the Court of Aldermen, and he may tell those
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
grave Gentlemen of changeable Colours, that he cares not whether they thank him or no.</P>
<P>And after all this, what will you say to these Men, and why should you think strange of their Manner of Proceeding?—Alas, Sir, you need make no wonder at all of it, you have it plainly ex∣press'd, and the Reason of it annex'd, Revel. 12. 12. <HI>The Devil is come down in great Rage, because he knows his Time is short</HI>—These Things all tend to the Advantage of our Establishment, and are as useful as Poisons in Physick—Little Clamours may chase and fret the Government, but loud Noise will awaken—Murmurs and Disconttents form a Party, and Words are like private Cabals—And with these a Government of ten bears and sits still—But when the Drum beats, Justice rouzes, and Powers begins to use its Hands</P>
<P>Let these People alone, when they have fill'd up the Measure of their Insolence, they will meet with Correction their own way—And as they effectually pull Vengeance, both Human and Di∣vine, upon their own Heads, we have nothing to do but stand still, &amp; see these <HI>Aegyptians</HI> assist to drown one another in the Sea of their own Confusions.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Reverend Sir, I entreat you, turn all your Satyrs into Thanks and Acknowledgments, to every Kind of People, that will but forward these Precipitations. Do we not thank King <HI>James</HI> for the Revolution, the pushing <HI>Jacobites</HI> for the Suc∣cession, and the enflaming Dividers of these two Nations, for the Union? Do we not thank the <HI>Tackers</HI> for losing the Occasional Bill, and the Inva∣ders for baulking the Pretender?—Just thus shall all Precipitations end; just thus shall they ha∣sten their own Destruction—the holding out the
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
bloody Flag, has been the only Way to awaken the World, and drawing the Sword of Violence, has been the best Step to drawing the Sword of Delive∣rance.</P>
<P>Then thank him for preaching this honest Ser∣mon, thank the Honourable and Wise Gentlemen that invited him to it: who no doubt did it, that the virulent Spirit might disclose it self—And may he be invited to preach thus every Day, till the World be come a little more enlightned, and Men may recover from that absurd Blindness, that has so clouded their Understanding,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, Reverend Sir, Your most gentle Reprover,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>AMICUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
