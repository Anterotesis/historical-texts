<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which the reader may, or may
not peruse.</HEAD>
<P>THE world is so taken up of
late with Novels and Ro∣mances,
generally spun from the
brains of needy authors, and often
very improbably related, that it will
be difficult for a real history, tho'
founded upon facts, to be taken for
genuine.</P>
<P>Laetitia Atkins, though vulgarly
called Moll Flanders, the heroine
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
of the following history, was as
beautiful a woman, and as fine a
figure, as any would desire to be∣hold;
and from her conversation,
at the time she produced me her
manuscript, I imagined she would
want but little of my assistance:
but, in that particular, I found
my error; for though she had
received what is called a liberal
education, I mean for a woman,
yet, when she came to express her
thoughts upon paper, they were
delivered not with half that pro∣priety,
which she held in conver∣sation.</P>
<P>She told me that it was not only
written in her own hand, but
that there was not a single inci∣dent
would be found in her whole
story, but was really and literally
true; and indeed there are abun∣dance,
and all of them usefully
applied: there is also an agreeable
turn given them in the relating,
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
that naturally instructs, and di∣verts
the reader; yet, upon my
giving the book another reading,
several years after the publica∣tion;
I was astonished to find I
had suffered many circumstances
to appear in print, which, though
they were true, upon a more cool
reflection, my judgment could not
by any means approve.</P>
<P>I therefore, still keeping truth
in view, by never suffering her to
escape my sight, altered many parts
of it, to give it the better reading,
as I some little time before had
done by Roxana; or, the Fortu∣nate
Mistress; in the doing of
which as I pleased myself, I have
the less doubt of pleasing my read∣ers
also.</P>
<P>That part of her life with her
young master, at Colchester, has
so many happy turns given it to
expose the crime, and warn all,
whose circumstances are adapted to
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
it, of the ruinous end of such in∣discretions,
and the thoughtless
and abhorred conduct of both the
parties, that it abundantly atones
for the description she gives of her
folly.</P>
<P>The repentance of her lover at
the Bath, and how brought by the
just alarm of his fit of sickness to
abandon her; the caution given
against even the lawful intimacies
of the dearest friends, and how
unable they are to preserve the most
solemn resolutions of virtue with∣out
divine assistance; are parts,
which, to a just discernment, will
appear to have more real beau∣ty
in them, than all the amorous
romances that have ever been pub∣lished.</P>
<P>Her application, and industrious
management at last in Virginia,
with her transported husband, is
a story fruitful of instruction, to
all who are obliged to seek their
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
re-establishment abroad; whether
by the misery of transportation,
or other disaster; letting them
know, that diligence and applica∣tion
have their due encouragement,
even in the remotest parts of the
world; that no case can be so
low, so despicable, or so empty of
prospect, but that an unwearied
industry will go a great way to
deliver us from it, will in time
raise the meanest creature to appear
again in the world, and give him a
new prospect for his life.</P>
<P>These are a few of the serious
inferences which we are led by the
hand to in this book, and these
are fully sufficient to justify me
in recommending it to the world,
and much more to justify the pub∣lication
of it.</P>

<P>My father was an intimate ac∣quaintance
of Mr. Daniel Defoe.
I had frequently heard him speak of
his friend, highly to his advan∣tage
as a moral writer, in many
of his publications, and wondered
much, after my reading his Robin∣son
Crusoe, to find both in his
Roxana, and in his Moll Flanders,
expressions so much beneath him;
but, upon a perusal, when I came
in possession of the manuscripts of
his alteration of both those histories,
I acquiesced in the opinion of my
father, and in that opinion, have
thought it proper, in their new
dress, to introduce them for the
entertainment of those who are
admirers of nature:</P>

<HEAD>THE
HISTORY
OF
LAETITIA ATKINS,
Vulgarly called
MOLL FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>I Think it may, with great propriety,
be said, I met with a part of the
misfortunes of the world, before I came
into it, my father, Theophilus Atkins,
being dead, near six months, before I
was born.</P>
<P>My father was, by trade, a glazier
and painter, but he dying, leaving my
mother a widow in circumstances but
indifferent, she one evening, as a lady
was getting out of her coach at the
Opera-house, was detected, in too great
a familiarity, with the lady's gold watch;
for which fact, at the Old Bailey, she
received sentence of death; but, at that
<PB N="2" REF="10"/>
awful bar, pleading she was with child,
was confined in Newgate, until she was
delivered of me; afterwards her sen∣tence
was changed to be transported for
her natural life, and she was according∣ly
sent to Virginia.</P>
<P>Having an aunt, sister to my father,
living at Colchester in credit, she edu∣cated
and maintained me in a genteel
manner, until I arrived to the age of
eighteen; she dying and leaving me her
effects, application was made to me by
an elderly lady of the place, an ac∣quaintance
of my late aunt, to wait on
two of her eldest daughters.</P>
<P>Here I had all the advantages for im∣proving
my education that could be
imagined; for the ladies had their seve∣ral
masters who came to the house to
teach them; and as I was always with
them, though the masters were not ap∣pointed
to teach me, yet I retained by
intimation and inquiry all that they learn∣ed
by instruction and direction. So that,
as the ladies said, I danced and spoke
French better than they did, and as I
had a finer pipe, I Tung better too, and
had been used to the harpsicord. By
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
this means I had all the advantages that
I could have desired, if I had been their
equal in point of fortune.</P>
<P>I had with all these the common va∣nity
of my sex. Being really taken for
a great beauty, I had as good an opi∣nion
of myself, as any body else could
have of me; and particularly I loved to
hear any body speak of it; which could
not but happen sometimes, and was a
great satisfaction to me.</P>
<P>Thus far I have had a smooth story
to tell of myself, and in this part of my
life, I not only had the reputation of
living in a very good family, respected
every where for virtue and sobriety; but
I had the character too of a very sober,
modest, and virtuous young woman;
and such I had always been, neither had
I yet any occasion to think of any thing
else, or to know what a temptation to
wickedness meant.</P>
<P>But that which I was too vain of, was
my ruin. The lady in the house where
I was, had also two sons, young gentle∣men
of very promising parts and of ex∣traordinary
behaviour; and it was my
misfortune to be agreeable to them both,
<PB N="4" REF="12"/>
but they managed themselves with me in
a quite different manner.</P>
<P>The eldest, a gay gentleman that
knew the town, as well as the country,
and though he had levity, yet had too
much judgment of things, to pay too
dear for his pleasures; he began that
unhappy snare to all women, taking no∣tice
how pretty I was, how agreeable,
how well carriaged: he would contrive
to be talking this to his sisters, when
though I was not by, yet when he knew
I was not so far off but that I should be
sure to hear him. His sisters would re∣turn
softly to him, “Hush brother, Let∣ty
will hear you, she is but in the next
room.” Then he would put it off, and
talk softlier, as if he had not known
it, and to acknowledge he was wrong;
and as if he had forgot himself, he
would speak aloud again, and I was
so well pleased to hear it, was sure to
listen for it on all occasions.</P>
<P>One day, he going by his sister's cham∣ber
when I was dressing her, he comes
in with an air of gaiety, “O! Letty,
don't your cheeks burn?” I made a
curtsey, and blush'd, but said nothing.
<PB N="5" REF="13"/>
“What makes you talk so, brother?”
says the lady. “Why,” says he, “we
have been talking of her below-stairs
this half-hour.” “Well,” says his sis∣ter,
“you can say no harm of her, that I
am sure, so it is no matter what you
have been talking about.” “Nay,”
says he, “it is so far from saying any
harm of her, that we have been talking
a great deal of good, and a great many
fine things have been said of Letty, I
assure you; and particularly, that she
is the handsomest girl in Colchester.”</P>
<P>“I wonder at you, brother: Letty
wants but one thing, but she had as
good want every thing, for the market
is against our sex just now; and if a
young woman have beauty, birth,
breeding, wit, sense, manners, modesty,
and all these to an extream; yet, if she
have not money, she is no-body, she
had as good want them all, for nothing
but money now recommends a woman;
the men play the game all into their
own hands.”</P>
<P>Her younger brother, who was by,
replied, “Hold, sister, you run too fast,
I am an exception to your rule; I as∣sure
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
you, if I find a woman so accom∣plished
as you talk of, I would not
trouble myself about the money.”</P>
<P>“O,” says the sister, “but you will
take care not to fancy one then, with∣out
the money.”</P>
<P>“You don't know that neither,” says
the younger brother.</P>
<P>“But, why sister,” says the elder
brother, “why do you so exclaim at the
men, for aiming so much at the for∣tune?
you are none of them that want
a fortune, what ever else you may want.”</P>
<P>“I understand you, brother,” replies
the lady very smartly, “you suppose I
have the money, and want the beauty;
but as times go now, the first will do
without the last, so I have the better of
my neighbours.”</P>
<P>“Well,” says the younger brother,
“but your neighbours, as you call
them, may be even with you; for beau∣ty
will steal a husband sometimes in spite
of money; and when the maid chances
to be handsomer than the mistress, she
oftentimes makes as good a market, and
rides in a coach before her.”</P>
<P>I thought it was time for me to with∣draw,
<PB N="7" REF="15"/>
and leave them, and I did so;
but not so far, but that I heard their dis∣course,
in which I also heard abundance
of fine things said of myself, which
served to prompt my vanity; but, as I
soon found, was not the way to increase
my interest in the family; for the sister,
and the younger brother fell grievously
out about it; and as he said some very
disobliging things to her, upon my ac∣count,
so I could easily see that she
resented them, by her future conduct to
me, which indeed was very unjust, for
I had never had the least thought of
what she suspected, as to her younger
brother: indeed, the elder had said a
great many things, as in jest, which I
had the folly to believe were in earnest,
or to flatter myself, with the hopes of
what I ought to have supposed he never
intended, and perhaps never thought of.</P>
<P>It happened one day that he came
running up stairs, towards the room
where his sisters used to sit and work, as
he often did, and calling to them be∣fore
he came in, as was his way, I be∣ing
there alone stept to the door, and
said, “Sir, the ladies are not here, they
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
are walked down the garden.” As I
stept forward to say this, he was just
got to the door, and clasping me in his
arms, as if it had been by chance, “O!
Mrs. Letty, are you here? I want to
speak with you, more than I do with
them,” and having me in his arms, he
kissed me several times.</P>
<P>I struggled to get away, yet he held
me fast, and still kissed me till he was
almost out of breath: and then sitting
down, said, “My dear Letty I am in
love with you.”</P>
<P>His words, I must confess fired my
blood, my spirits flew about my heart,
and put me into disorder, which he
might easily have seen in my face; he
repeated it several times, that he was in
love with me, and though my heart
fluttered, I confess I was secretly pleased
with his expressions; however nothing
further passed at that time, it was but
a surprise, and when he had left me, I
soon recovered myself; and had there
not been one small misfortune in it, I
had been in the right; but the mistake
lay here, that Mrs. Letty was in earnest,
and the young gentleman was not.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="17"/>
It was not long, before he found an
opportunity to catch me again. The
young ladies were gone a visiting with
their mother; his brother was out of
town, and as for his father, he had been
at London a week; he had so well
watched me, that he knew where I was,
though I did not so much as know that
he was in the house; he coming up
the stairs, and seeing me at work came
into the room, and began just as he did
before with taking me in his arms, and
kissing me.</P>
<P>It was his younger sister's chamber
that I was in, and as there was nobody
in the house, but the maids below ftairs:
he taking this advantage, he threw me
down upon the bed; but he offered no
other rudeness than kissing me.</P>
<P>I struggled, and told him somebody
was coming, upon which he lifted me
up, professing a great deal of love, that
it was an honest affection, and he meant
no ill to me: saying this, he put five
guineas into my hand, and immediately
left me.</P>
<P>I am the more particular in this part,
that when my story comes to be read, by
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
those of my own sex, they may learn
from it to guard themselves against the
mischiefs which attend an early know∣ledge
of their own beauty: for when a
young woman once thinks herself hand∣some,
The never doubts the truth of any
man, that tells her he is in love with
her; for if the believes herself charm∣ing
enough to captivate him, it is natu∣ral
to expect the effects of it.</P>
<P>This young gentleman had fired his
inclination, as much as he had fired my
vanity; and as if he had found that he
had an opportunity, and was sorry he
did not improve it, he, presently, came
up again, telling me how passionately he
loved me, and that though he could not
mention such a thing, till he came to
his estate, yet he was resolved to make
me happy then, and himself too by his
marrying me.</P>
<P>We had not sat long, but he got up,
and stopping my breath with kisses, he
again threw me upon the bed; and here,
I confess, he went farther with me than
decency permits me to mention.</P>
<P>However, though he took these free∣doms,
it did not go to that, which they
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
call the last favour, which, to do him
justice, he did not attempt; and he
made that self-denial of his, a plea for
all his freedoms with me upon other oc∣casions
after. When this was over, he
staid but a little while, and left me;
making a thousand protestations of his
passion for me, and of his loving me
above all the women in the world.</P>
<P>Nothing sure was ever so stupid. Had I
acted as became me, and resisted as virtue
and honour required, this gentleman,
had either desisted his attacks, finding
no room to expect the accomplishment of
his design, or had made fair and ho∣nourable
proposals of marriage; in
which case, whoever had blamed him,
nobody could have blamed me. If I
had known his mind, and how hard he
thought I would be to be gained. I
might have made my own terms with
him; and if I had not capitulated for an
immediate marriage, I might for a main∣tenance
till marriage, and might have
had what I would; for he was already
rich to excess, besides what he had in
expectation; but I wholly abandoned
all such thoughts and was taken up only
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
with the pride of my beauty, and of
my being beloved.</P>
<P>In the mean time, however, I did
not give room to any in the family to
suspect me, or to imagine that I had the
least correspondence with this young
gentleman; I scarce ever looked towards
him in publick, or answered if he spoke
to me, if any body was near us; but
for all that, we had every now and then
a little encounter, where we had room
for a word or two, and now and then a
kiss.</P>
<P>But as the Devil is an unwearied
tempter, so he never fails to find oppor∣tunity
for that wickedness he invites to:
it was one evening that I was in the gar∣den,
with his sisters, and himself, and
all very innocently merry, when he
found means to convey a note into my
hand, by which he directed me to un∣derstand,
that he would to-morrow de∣fire
me publickly to go of an errand for
him into the town, and that I should see
him somewhere by the way.</P>
<P>Accordingly after dinner, he very
gravely says to me, his sisters being by,
“Letty, I must ask a favour of you.”
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
“What's that?” says his second sister.”
“Nay, sister,” says he, “if you cannot
spare Mrs. Letty to-day, any other time
will do.” Yes, they said, they could
spare her well enough, and the sister beg∣ged
pardon for asking. “Well, but bro∣ther,”
says the eldest sister, “you must
tell Letty what it is; if it be any private
business, that we must not hear, you
may call her out, there she is.”</P>
<P>“Indeed, sister, I have no private
business with Mrs. Letty;” and when
he had given me my instructions, he
told them a long story of a visit he was
going to make to a family they all knew,
and where was to be such and such gen∣tlemen,
and how merry they were to be;
and very formally asked his sisters to go
with him, and they as formally excus'd
themselves because of company that
they had notice were to come and visit
them that afternoon, which, by the way,
he had contrived on purpose.</P>
<P>He had scarce done speaking to them,
and given me my errand, but his man
came up to tell him, that Sir William's
chariot was at the door; so he runs
down, and comes up again immediately,
<PB N="14" REF="22"/>
“Alas!” says he to his sisters, “there's
all my mirth spoiled at once; Sir Wil∣liam
has sent his chariot for me, and
desires to speak with me upon some ear∣nest
business.” It seems Sir William
was a gentleman, who liv'd about three
miles out of town, to whom he had
spoken on purpose the day before, to
lend him his chariot for a particular oc∣casion;
and had appointed it to call for
him, as it did about three o'clock.</P>
<P>Immediately he calls for his hat and
sword, and ordered his man to go to the
other place to make his excuse; that was
to say, he made an excuse to send his
man away, and prepares to go into the
chariot: as he was going he stopt, and
speaks mighty earnestly to me about his
business, and finds opportunity to say
very softly to me, “Come away, Letty,
as soon as you can.” I said nothing,
but made a curtsey, as if I had done so
to what he had said in publick; in about
a quarter of an hour I went out too,
so that there was not the least suspicion
in the house. He waited for me in the
chariot in a back lane, which he knew
I must pass by, and directed the coach∣man
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
where to drive; which was to a
certain place, as I afterwards found,
where lived a confident of his, and
where was all the convenience he could
desire, to put in practice what he in∣tended.</P>
<P>When we arrived at the house, he be∣gan
to talk very gravely to me, and to
tell me, he did not bring me there to
betray me; that his passion for me would
not suffer him to abuse me; that he re∣solved
to marry me as soon as he came
to his estate, and in the mean time, if I
would grant him his request, he would
maintain me very honourably, and made
me a thousand protestations of his since∣rity,
and of his affection, and that he
would never abandon me.</P>
<P>However, as he pressed me to speak,
I told him, I had no reason to question
the sincerity of his love, after so many
protestations, but—and there I
stopt; “But, what, my dear? I guess
what you mean—if you should be with
child. “Why then,” says he, “I'll
take care and provide for you, and the
child too; and that you may see I am
not in jest, here's an earnest for you;”
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
and with that he pulls out a purse full of
gold, and gave it me; “and I'll give
you such another every year till I marry
you.”</P>
<P>Thus I finished my own destruction
at once: for from this day, being forsa∣ken
of my virtue, I had nothing of
value left to recommend me either to
God's blessing or man's assistance.</P>
<P>In about two hours I arrived at home
again; as for him he staid out, as he
told me he would, till late at night, and
there was not the least suspicion in the
family, either on his account or mine.</P>
<P>We had, after this, frequent opportu∣nities
to repeat our crime; chiefly by
his contrivance, especially at home, when
his mother and the young ladies went
abroad a visiting, which he watched so
narrowly as never to miss, knowing al∣ways
before-hand when they went out,
and then failed not to catch me alone,
and this for near half a year; and yet,
which was the most to my satisfaction,
I was not with child.</P>
<P>Before the half year was expired, his
younger brother, of whom I have made
some mention, finding me alone in the
garden one evening, begins a story of
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
the same kind, made honest professions
of being in love, and in short, proposed
fairly and honourably to marry me.</P>
<P>I was now confounded and driven to
such an extremity, as the like was never
known; at least not to me. I resisted
the proposal with obstinacy, and now I
began to arm myself with arguments:
I laid before him the inequality of the
match; the treatment I should meet with
in the family; the ingratitude it would
be to his good father and mother, who
had taken me into their house upon such
generous principles; in short, I said
every thing to dissuade him from his
design that I could imagine, except tell∣ing
him the truth, which would indeed
have put an end to it all, but that I
durst not think of mentioning.</P>
<P>But here happened a circumstance
that I did not expect, which put me to
my shifts; for this young gentleman as
he was plain and honest, so he pretend∣ed
to nothing with me, but what was so
too; and knowing his own innocence,
he was not so careful to make his hav∣ing
a kindness for me a secret in the
house, as his brother was; and though
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
he did not let them know that he had
talked to me about it, yet he said enough
to let his sisters perceive he liked me,
and his mother saw it too, which tho'
they took no notice of it to me, yet
they did to him, and immediately I
found their carriage to me altered, more
than ever before.</P>
<P>I saw the cloud, though I did not
foresee the storm. It was easy to see
their carriage to me was altered, and
that it grew worse and worse every day;
till at last, I got information among the
servants, that I should, in a very little
while, be desired to remove.</P>
<P>I was not alarmed at the news, hav∣ing
a full satisfaction that I should be
otherwise provided for; and especially,
considering that I had reason every day
to expect I should be with child, and
that then I should be obliged to remove
without any pretences for it.</P>
<P>After some time, the younger gentle∣man
took an opportunity to tell me,
that the kindness he had for me, had
got vent in the family. He did not
charge me with it, he said, for he
knew well enough which way it came
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
out; he told me his plain way of talk∣ing
had been the occasion of it, for that
he did not make his respect for me so
much a secret as he might have done,
and the reason was, if I would consent
to have him, he would tell them all
openly he loved me, and that he intend∣ed
to marry me: that it was true his
father and mother might resent it, and
be unkind; but that he was now in a
way to live, being bred to the law, and
he did not fear maintaining me, agreea∣ble
to what I should expect; and, as he
believed I would not be ashamed of
him, so he was resolved not to be afham∣ed
of me; and that he scorned to be
afraid to own me now, who he resolved
to own after I was his wife, and therefore
I had nothing to do but to give him my
hand, and he would answer for all the
rest.</P>
<P>I was now in a dreadful condition in∣deed.
And here I repented heartily my
easiness with the eldest brother, not from
any reflection of conscience, but from a
view of the happiness I might have en∣joyed,
and had now made impossible:
for though I had no scruples of consci∣ence,
<PB N="20" REF="28"/>
as I have said, to struggle with,
yet I could not think of being a mistress
to one brother and a wife to the other.
But then it came into my thoughts,
that the first brother, had promised to
make me his wife, when he came to
his estate; but I presently remembered,
what I had often thought of, that he
had never spoken a word of having me
for a wife, after he had conquered me
for a mistress; and indeed till now, tho'
I said I thought of it often, yet it gave
me no disturbance; for as he did not
seem in the least to lessen his affection
to me, so neither did he lessen his boun∣ty,
though he had the discretion him∣self
to desire me not to lay out a shill∣ing
of what he gave me in cloaths, or to
make the least shew extraordinary, be∣cause
it would necessarily give jealousy
in the family.</P>
<P>But I was now in a great strait, and
really knew not what to do. The main
difficulty was this; the younger brother
not only laid close siege to me, but suf∣fered
it to be seen; he would come into
his sister's room, and his mother's room,
and sit down, and talk a thousand kind
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
things of me, and to me, even before
their faces, and when they were all
there: this grew so publick, that the
whole house talked of it, and his mo∣ther
reproved him for it, and their car∣riage
to me appeared quite altered: in
short, his mother had let fall some
speeches, as if she intended to put me out
of the family, that is, to turn me out
of doors. Now, I was sure this could
not be a secret to his brother, only that
he might not think, as indeed nobody
else yet did, that the youngest brother
had made any proposals to me about it:
but as I easily could see that it would go
farther, so I saw likewise there was an
absolute necessity to speak of it to him,
or that he would speak of it to me; and
which to wait for I knew not.</P>
<P>Upon serious consideration, for in∣deed
now I began to consider things ve∣ry
seriously, and never till now; I say,
upon serious consideration, I resolved to
tell him of it first, and it was not long
before I had an opportunity: for the
very next day his brother went to Lon∣don
upon some business, and the family
being out a visiting, just as it had hap∣pened
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
before, and as indeed was often
the case, he came according to his cus∣tom
to spend an hour or two with
me.</P>
<P>When he had sat down a while, he
perceived there was an alteration in my
countenance, that I was not so free and
pleasant with him, as I used to be, and
particularly that I had been a crying;
he was not long before he took notice of
it, and asked me in very kind terms
what was the matter, and if any thing
troubled me: I would have put it off if
I could, but it was not to be concealed;
so after suffering many importunities to
draw that out of me, which I longed as
much as possible to disclose; I told him
that it was true, something did trouble
me, and something of such a nature,
that I could not tell how to acquaint
him with it; that it was a thing that not
only surprised me, but greatly perplex∣ed
me, and that I knew not what course
to take, unless he would direct me. He
told me with great tenderness, that let
it be what it would, I should not let it
trouble me, for he would protect me
from all the world.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="31"/>
I then began at a distance, and told
him I was afraid the ladies had got some
secret information of our correspond∣ence;
for that it was easy to see, that
their conduct was very much changed
towards me, and now it was come to
that pass, that they frequently found
fault with me, though I never gave
them the least occasion: that whereas,
I used always to lay with the eldest sister,
I was lately put to lay by myself, or
with one of the maids; and that I had
over-heard them several times talking
very unkindly about me; but that
which confirmed it all, was, one of the
servants had told me, she had heard I
was to be turned out, and that it was not
safe for the family, that I should be any
longer in the house.</P>
<P>He smiled when he heard all this: and
I asked him, how he could make so
light of it, when he must needs know,
if there was any discovery, I was un∣done
for ever? and that even it would
hurt him, tho' not ruin him, as it would
me: I upbraided him, that he was like
all the rest of the sex, that when they
had the character and honour of a wo∣man
<PB N="24" REF="32"/>
at their mercy, oftentimes made it
their jest, and at least looked upon it as
a trifle, and counted the ruin of those,
they had had their will of, as a thing of
no value.</P>
<P>He saw me warm and serious, and
he changed his stile immediately. He
told me, he was sorry I should have
such a thought of him; that he had
never given me the least occasion for it,
but had been as tender of my reputa∣tion,
as he could be of his own; that
he was sure our correspondence had
been managed with so much address,
that not one creature in the family had
so much as a suspicion of it; that if he
smiled when I told him my thoughts, it
was at the assurance he lately received,
that our understanding one another,
was not so much as guessed at; and
that when he had told me how much
reason he had to be easy, I should smile
as he did, for he was very certain, it
would give me a full satisfaction.</P>
<P>“This is a mystery I cannot under∣stand,”
says I, “or how it should be to
my satisfaction that I am to be turned
out of doors; for if our correspondence
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
is not discovered, I know not what else
I have done to change the countenances
of the whole family, or to have them
treat me as they do now, who formerly
used me with so much tenderness, as
if I had been one of their own chil∣dren.</P>
<P>“Why look you, Letty,” says he,
“that they are uneasy about you, is
true; but that they have the least su∣spicion
of the case as it is, and as it re∣spects
you and I, is so far from being
true, that they suspect my brother; and
in short they are fully persuaded he makes
love to you: nay, he has put it into
their heads, for he is continually banter∣ing
them about it, and making a jest of
himself. I confess, I think he is wrong
to do so, because he cannot but see it
vexes them, and makes them unkind to
you; but it is a satisfaction that they do
not suspect me, and I hope this will be
to your satisfaction too.”</P>
<P>“So it is,” says I, “one way, but
this does not reach my case at all, nor is
this the chief thing that troubles me,
though I have been concerned about
that too.” “What is it then?” says he.
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
With which I fell into tears. He strove
to pacify me all he could, but began at
last to be very pressing upon me to tell
him what it was. I answered, that I
thought I ought to tell him, and that
he had some right to know it; besides,
I wanted his direction in the case, for I
was in such perplexity, that I knew not
what course to take: and then I related
the whole affair to him. I told him,
how imprudent his brother had manag∣ed,
in making himself so publick; for
that if he had kept it a secret, as such a
thing ought to have been, I could but
have denied him positively, without
giving any reason for it, and he would
in time have ceased his sollicitations;
but that he had the vanity, first, to de∣pend
upon it that I would not deny him,
and then had taken the freedom to tell
his resolution of having me to the
whole house.</P>
<P>I told him how far I had resisted him,
and how sincere and honourable his of∣fers
were; “But,” says I, “my case
will be doubly hard; for as they car∣ry
it ill to me now, because he desires
to have me, they will carry it worse when
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
they shall find I have denied him; and
they will presently say, `There is some∣thing
else in it,' and then out it comes,
that I am already married to somebody
else, or that I would never refuse a
match so much above me.”</P>
<P>This discourse surprised him: he told
me, it was a critical point for me to
manage, and he did not see which way I
should get out of it; but he would con∣sider
of it, and let me know the next
time we met, what resolution he was
come to about it; and in the mean
time, desired I would not give my con∣sent
to his brother, nor yet give him a
a flat denial, but to hold him in su∣spence.</P>
<P>I started at his saying, I should not
give him my consent. I said, he knew
very well I had no consent to give; that
he had engaged himself to marry me,
and my consent was at the same time
engaged to him: that he had all along
told me I was his wife, and I looked
upon myself as effectually so, as if the
ceremony had passed; and it was from
his own mouth that I did so, he having
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
all along persuaded me to call myself
his wife.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear love, don't be con∣cerned,
if I am not your husband, I will be
as good as a husband to you; and do not
let those things trouble you now, but let
me look a little farther into this affair,
and I shall be able to say more next
time we meet.”</P>
<P>He pacified me as well as he could
with this: but I found he was very
thoughtful, and though he was very
kind to me, and kissed me often, yet he
offered no more all the while we were to∣gether,
which was above two hours,
and which I much wondered at, consi∣dering
what opportunity we had.</P>
<P>His brother did not come from Lon∣don
for five or six days, and it was two
days more before he got an opportunity
to talk with him; but then getting him
by himself, he began to talk very close
to him about it: and the same evening
he repeated the substance of their discourse
to me, which as near as I can remember
was to the purpose following: he said, he
had heard strange news of him since he
went—that he made love to Mrs. Letty.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="37"/>
“Well,” says his brother, a little an∣grily,
“and what then? What has
any body to do wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h it▪” Nay,” says
his brother,” don't be angry Robert, I
don't pretend to have any thing to do
with it, nor do I pretend to be angry
with you; but I find they do concern
themselves about it, and that they use
the poor girl ill, which I should take
as done to myself. “Who do you mean
by They,” says Robert. “I mean my
mother, and the girls,” says the elder
brother.</P>
<P>“But hark ye, are you in earnest,
do you really love the girl? you may be
free with me, brother.” Why then,”
says Robert, “I will be free with you.
I do love her above all the women in the
world; and I will have her, let them say
and do what they will. I believe the
girl will not deny me.”</P>
<P>It struck me to the heart when he
told me this: for though it was most ra∣tional
to think I would not deny him,
yet I knew in my conscience I must de∣ny
him, and I saw my ruin in my being
obliged to do so; but I knew it was my
<PB N="30" REF="38"/>
business to talk otherwise then, so I in∣terrupted
him in his story.</P>
<P>“Ay!” said I, “does he think I can∣not
deny him? but he shall find I can
deny him.”</P>
<P>“Well, my dear,” says he, “but let
me give you the whole story as it went
on between us, and then say what you
will.”</P>
<P>Then he went on and told me, that
he replied, “But brother, you know
she has nothing, and you may have se∣veral
ladies with good fortunes.” “It
is no matter for that,” said Robert, “I
love the girl; and I will never please
my pocket in marrying, and not please
my fancy;” and so, my dear, added he,
there is no opposing him.</P>
<P>“Yes, yes,” says I, “you shall see I
can oppose him: I have learn'd to say
No now, tho' I had not learnt it before;
and if the best lord in the land offered me
marriage, I could very chearfully say
No to him.”</P>
<P>“Well, but my dear,” says he, “what
can you say to him? You know, as
you said, when we talked of it before,
he will ask you many questions about
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
it, and all the family will wonder what
the meaning of it should be.”</P>
<P>“Why, says I, smiling, “I can stop
all their mouths at once, by telling
him, and them too, that I am married
already to his elder brother.”</P>
<P>He smiled a little too at the word,
but I could see it startled him, and he
could not hide the disorder it put him
into; however, he returned, “Why, tho'
that may be true in some sense, yet I
suppose you are but in jest when you
talk of giving such an answer, as it
may not be convenient on many ac∣counts.”</P>
<P>“No, no,” says I pleasantly, “I
am not so fond of letting that secret
come out, without your consent.”</P>
<P>“But what then can you say to
him, or to them,” says he, “when
they find you positive against a match,
which would be apparently so much to
your advantage?”</P>
<P>“Why,” says I, “should I be at a
loss? First, I am not obliged to give
them any reason at all: on the other
hand, I may tell them, I am married
already, and stop there; and that will
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
be a full stop too to him, for he can
have no reason to ask me one question
after it.”</P>
<P>“Ay,” says he, “but the whole
house will teize you about it, even to my
father and mother; and if you deny them
positively, they will be disobliged at
you, and suspicious besides.”</P>
<P>“Why,” says I, “what can I do?
What would you have me do? I was in
strait enough before, and, as I told
you, I was in perplexity before, and ac∣quainted
you with the circumstances,
that I might have your advice.”</P>
<P>“My dear,” says he, “I have been
considering very much upon it, you
may be sure; and though it is a piece
of advice that has a great many morti∣fications
in it to me, and may at first
seem strange to you, yet, all things con∣sidered,
I see no better way than to let
him go on; and if you find him in
earnest, marry him.”</P>
<P>I gave him a look full of horror at
those words, and turning pale as death,
was at the very point of sinking down
out of the chair I sat in: when giving
a start, “My dear,” says he, aloud,
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
“what is the matter with you? Where
are you going?” and a great many such
things; and with jogging and calling
to me, fetched me a little to myself,
though it was a good while before I
fully recovered my senses, and was not
able to speak for several minutes after.</P>
<P>When I was fully recovered he be∣gan
again. “My dear,” says he, “what
made you so surprised at what I said? I
would have you consider seriously of it:
you may see plainly how the family
stand, and they would be stark mad if
it was my case, as it is my brother's;
and for ought I see, it would be my
ruin and your's too.”</P>
<P>“Ah!” says I, still speaking angri∣ly,
“are all your protestations and vow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to be shaken by the dislike of the fami∣ly?
Did I not always object that to
you, and you made light of it, as what
you were above, and would not value;
and is it come to this now? is this your
faith and honour, your love, and the
solidity of your promises?”</P>
<P>He continued perfectly calm, notwith∣standing
all my reproaches, and I was
not sparing of them; but he replied at
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
last, “My dear I have not broken one
promise with you yet. I did tell you I
would marry you when I was come to
my estate: but you see my father is a
hail healthy man, and may live these
thirty years still, and not be older than
several are round us in the town; and
you never proposed my marrying you
sooner, because you know it might be
my ruin: and as to all the rest, I have
not failed you in any thing, you have
wanted for nothing.”</P>
<P>I could not deny a word of this, and
had nothing to say to it in general;</P>
<P>“But why then,” says I, “can you
persuade me to such a horrid step, as
leaving you, since you have not left
me? Will you allow no affection, no
love on my side, where there has been
so much on yours? Have I made you
no returns? Have I given no testimo∣ny
of my sincerity, and of my passion?
are the sacrifices I have made, no proof
of my being tied to you in bonds too
strong to be broken?</P>
<P>“But here, my dear,” says he, “you
may come into a sase station, and appear
with honour, and with splendor at once,
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
and the remembrance of what we have
done, may be wrapt up in an eternal
silence, as if it had never happened.
You shall always have my respect, and
my sincere affection, only then it shall
be honest, and perfectly just to my
brother, you shall be my dear sister, as
now you are my dear—” and there he
stopped.</P>
<P>“Base man! your dear whore, you
must have said, if you had gone on,
and you might as well have said it; but
I understand you: however, I desire you
to remember the discourses you have
had with me, and the pains you have
taken to persuade me to believe myself
an honest woman; that I was your wife
intentionally, though not in the eye of
the world; and that it was as effectual
a marriage that had passed between us,
as if we had been publickly wedded in
the church. You know, and cannot but
remember that these have been your own
words to me.”</P>
<P>He standing motionless for a while,
without replying, I proceeded thus:</P>
<P>“You cannot, without the highest
injustice, believe that I yielded upon all
<PB N="36" REF="44"/>
these persuasions without a love not to
be questioned, not to be shaken again
by any thing that could happen af∣terward:
if you have such dishonoura∣ble
thoughts of me, I must ask you
what foundation in any of my beha∣viour
have I given for such a suggestion?
If then I have yielded to the impor∣tunities
of my affection; if I have been
persuaded to believe that I am really
your wife, shall I now give the lie to all
those arguments, and call myself your
mistress? And will you transfer me to
your brother? can you transfer my af∣fection?
can you bid me cease loving
you, and bid me love him? is it in my
power, think you, to make such a change
at demand? No, Sir, depend upon it,
it is impossible; and whatever the al∣teration
on your side may be, I will
ever be true; and I had much rather,
since it is come to this unhappy length,
be a mistress to you, than a wife to your
brother.”</P>
<P>He appeared pleased, and touched with
the impression of this discourse; and told
me he had not been unfaithful in any
one promise he had ever made me yet,
<PB N="37" REF="45"/>
but there were so many terrible things
presented themselves to his view in the
affair before me, and on my account in
particular, that he had thought of the
other as a remedy so effectual, as no∣thing
could come up to it: that he
thought this would not be an entire
parting us, but we might love as friends
all our days, and perhaps with more
satisfaction, than we should in the situa∣tion
we were now in, as things might
happen: he durst say, I could not ap∣prehend
any thing from him, as to be∣traying
a secret, which could not but
be the destruction of us both, if it came
out: he had but one question to ask of
me, that could lie in the way of it, and
it that question was answered in the ne∣gative,
he could not but think still it
was the only step I could take.</P>
<P>I guessed at his question presently,
namely, whether I was sure I was not
with child? As to that, I told him, he
need not be concerned about it, for I
was not with child. “Why then, my
dear,” says he, “we have no time to
talk farther now; consider of it, and
think closely about it. I cannot but be
<PB N="38" REF="46"/>
of the opinion still, that it will be the
best course you can take: and with this,
he took his leave, and the more hastily
too, his mother and sisters ringing at the
gate, just at the moment that he had
risen up to go.</P>
<P>He left me in the utmost confusion
of thought; and he easily perceived it
the next day, and all the rest of the
week: but he had no opportunity to
come at me till the Sunday after, when
I being indisposed did not go to church,
and he making some excuse staid also
at home.</P>
<P>Here he was with me an hour and a
half, and we fell into the same argu∣ments
over again, or at least so near the
same, as it would be to no purpose to
repeat them. At last, I asked him warm∣ly
what opinion he must have of me,
that he could suppose, I should so much
as entertain a thought of lying with two
brothers? and assured him it could
never be. I added, if he was to tell me
that he would never see me again, than
which nothing could be more terrible,
yet I could never entertain a thought so
dishonourable to myself, and so base to
<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
him; and therefore, I entreated him, if
he had any affection left for me, that he
would speak no more of it, or that he
would draw his sword and kill me. He
appeared surprised at my obstinacy, as
he called it; told me I was unkind to
myself and unkind to him in it; that it
was a crisis unlooked for, upon us both,
and impossible for either or us to fore∣see;
but that he did not know any other
way to save us from ruin, and therefore
he thought it the more unkind; but
that if he must say no more of it to me,
he added, with an unusual coldness, that
he did not know any thing else we had
to talk of; and rose up to take his
leave. I rose up too as if with the same
indifference: but, when he came to give
me as it were a parting kiss, I burst out
into such a passion of crying, that tho'
I would have spoke, I could not, and
only pressing his hand, seemed to give
him the adieu, but cried vehemently.</P>
<P>He was sensibly moved with this: so
he sat down again, and said a great ma∣ny
kind things to me, to abate the ex∣cess
of my passion; but still urged the
necessity of what he had proposed▪ All
<PB N="40" REF="48"/>
the while insisting that if I did refuse,
he would notwithstanding provide for
me; but letting me plainly see, that he
would decline me as a mistress; making
it a point of honour not to lie with the
woman, that, for ought he knew, might
come to be his brother's wife.</P>
<P>The loss of him as a gallant was not
so much my affliction, as the loss of his
person, whom I loved to distraction;
and the loss of all the expectations I
had, and which I had always built my
hopes upon, of having him one day for
my husband. These things oppressed my
mind so much, that I fell very ill: the
ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nies of my mind, threw me into a
high fever, and long it was, that none
in the family expected me to live.</P>
<P>It was near five weeks that I kept my
bed: and though the violence of my fever
abated in three weeks, yet it several times
returned; and the physician and the apo∣thecary
said, several times, they could do no
more for me, but that they must leave na∣ture
and the distemper to fight it out;
only strenthening the first with cordials
to maintain the struggle. After the end
of five weeks I grew better: but was so
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
weak, so altered, so melancholy, and
recovered so slowly, that they apprehend∣ed
I should go into a consumption; and,
which vexed me most, they gave it as
their opinion, that my mind was op∣pressed,
that something troubled me,
and in short, that I was in love. Upon
this, the whole house was set upon me
to examine me, and to press me to tell
whether I was in love or not, and with
whom; but I denied my being in love
at all.</P>
<P>They had on this occasion a little
quarrel one day about me, that had like
to have put the whole family in an up∣roar,
and for some time did so. They
happened to be all at table, but the fa∣ther;
as for me I was ill, and in my
chamber: at the beginning of the talk,
which was just as they had finished their
dinner, the old lady, who had sent me
something to eat, called her maid to go
up, and ask me if I would▪ have any
more; but the maid brought down
word, I had not eaten half what she
had sent me already.
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
“Alas,” says the old lady, “that poor
girl! I am afraid, she will never be
well.”</P>
<P>“Well l” says the elder brother,
“how should Mrs. Letty be well; they
say she is in love?”</P>
<P>“I believe nothing of it,” says the
mother.</P>
<P>“I do not know,” says the eldest sis∣ter,
“what to say to it: they have made
such a rout about her being so handsome,
and so charming, and I know not what,
and in her hearing too, that it has turn∣ed
the creature's head I believe, and
who knows what possessions may follow
such doings? for my part I do not
know what to make of it.”</P>
<P>“Why, sister, you must acknowledge
she is very handsome,” says the elder
brother.</P>
<P>“Ay, and a great deal handsomer
than you, sister,” says Robert; “and that
is your mortification.”</P>
<P>“Well, well, that is not the ques∣tion,”
says his sister; “the girl is well
enough, and she knows it; she need not
be told of it to make her vain.”</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51"/>
“We are not talking of her being
vain,” says the elder brother, “but her
being in love; it may be she is in love
with herself, it seems my sisters think
so.”</P>
<P>“I would she was in love with me,”
says Robert, “I would quickly put her
out of her pain.”</P>
<P>“What do you mean, son,” says the
old lady, “how can you talk so?”
“Why Madam, very honestly, do
you think I would let the poor girl die
for love, and of one that is near at hand
to be had too?”</P>
<P>“Fy brother,” says the second sister,
“I am ashamed of you; would you take
a creature that has not a groat in the
world?”</P>
<P>“Prithee, miss,” says Robert, beau∣ty
is a portion, and good-humour with
it, is a double portion; I wish you
had half her stock.”</P>
<P>“I find,” says the eldest sister, “if
Letty is not in love, my brother is; I
wonder he has not broke his mind to
her: I warrant she will not say No.”</P>
<P>“They that yield when they are ask∣ed,”
says Robert, “are one step before
<PB N="44" REF="52"/>
them that were never asked to yield, and
two steps before them that yield before
they are asked: and that is an answer
to you, sister.”</P>
<P>This fired the sister, and she flew in∣to
a passion, and said things were come to
that pass, that it was time the wench
was out of the family; and but that she
was not fit to be turned out, she hoped
her father and mother would consider of
it, as soon as she could be removed.</P>
<P>Robert replied, that was business for
the master and mistress of the family,
who were not to be taught by one that
had so little judgment as his elde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
sister.</P>
<P>It ran up a great deal farther; the
sister scolded, Robert rallied and ban∣tered,
but I lost ground by it extreamly
in the family. I heard of it, and I cried
heartily: and the old lady came up to
me, somebody having told her that I
was so much concerned about it. I com∣plained
to her, that it was very hard
the doctors should pass such a censure
upon me, for which they had no ground;
and that it was still harder, considering
the circumstances I was under in the
<PB N="45" REF="53"/>
family; that I hoped I had done no∣thing
to lessen her esteem for me, or
given any occasion for the bickering be∣tween
her sons and daughters; and I
had more need to think of a coffin than
of being in love, and begged she would
not let me suffer in her opinion for any
body's mistakes but my own.</P>
<P>She was sensible of the justice of what
I said: but told me, since there was such
a clamour among them, and that her
younger son talked after such a rattling
way as he did; she desired I would be
so faithful to her, as to answer her one
question sincerely. I told her I would,
and with the utmost plainness and since∣rity.
Why then the question was, whe∣ther
there was any thing between her son
Robert and me? I told her with all the
protestations of sincerity that I was a∣ble
to make, that there was not, nor
ever had been. I told her, that Mr.
Robert had rattled and jested, as she
knew it was his way, and that I took it
always as I supposed he meant it, to be
a wild airy way of discourse that had no
signification in it: and again assured her,
that there was not the least tittle of what
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
she understood by it between us; and
those who had suggested so had done me
a great deal of wrong, and Mr. Robert
no service.</P>
<P>The old lady was fully satisfied, and
kissed me, spoke chearfully to me, bid
me take care of my health, and want for
nothing, and so took her leave: but
when she came down, she found the
brother and all his sisters together by
the ears: they were angry even to pas∣sion,
at his upbraiding them with their
being homely, and having never had
any sweatheart, never having been asked
the question, and their being so forward
as almost to ask first. He rallied them
upon the subject of Mrs. Letty; how
pretty, how good-humoured, how she
sung better than they did, and danced
better, and how much handsomer she
was: and in doing this, he omitted no
ill-natured thing that could vex them,
and indeed, was too hard upon them.
The old lady came down in the height
of it, and to put a stop to it, told them
all the discourse she had had with me.</P>
<P>“She is wrong there,” says Robert,
“for if there was not a great deal be∣tween
<PB N="47" REF="55"/>
us, we should be closer together
than we are: I have told her I loved
her, but I could never make the jade
believe I was in earnest”.</P>
<P>“I do not know how you should,”
says his mother, “nobody in their
senses could believe you were in earnest,
to talk so to a poor girl, whose cir∣cumstances
you know so well. But
prithee son,” added she, “since you
tell me that you could not make her
believe you were in earnest, what must
we believe about it? for you ramble so
in your discourse, that nobody knows
whether you are in earnest or in jest:
but as I find the girl by your own con∣fession
has answered truly, I wish you
would do so too, and tell me seriously,
so that I may depend upon it; Is there
any thing in it or no? Are you in
earnest or no? Are you distracted, in∣deed,
or are you not? It is a weighty
question, and I wish you would make us
easy about it.”</P>
<P>“Faith, madam,” says Robert, “it
is in vain to mince the matter, or tell
any lies about it. I am in earnest. If
Mrs. Letty would say she loved me,
<PB N="48" REF="56"/>
and that she would marry me, I would
have her to-morrow morning.”</P>
<P>“Well,” says the mother, “then
there is one son lost; and she said it in
a very mournful tone, as one greatly
concerned at it.”</P>
<P>“I hope not, madam, says Robert;
“no man is lost, when a good wife has
found him.”</P>
<P>“Why, but son,” says the old lady,
“she is a beggar.”</P>
<P>“Why then, madam, she has the
more need of charity: I will take her
off of the hands of the parish, and she
and I will beg together.”</P>
<P>“It is bad jesting with such things,”
says the mother.</P>
<P>“I do not jest madam,” says Robert:
“We will come and beg your pardon,
and your blessing, madam, and my fa∣ther's.”</P>
<P>“This is all out of the way, son,”
says the mother;” “if you are in earnest
you are undone.”</P>
<P>“I am afraid not,” says he, “for I am
really afraid she will not have me, after
all my sister's huffing and blustering; I
<PB N="49" REF="57"/>
believe I shall never be able to persuade
her to it.”</P>
<P>“That is a fine tale, indeed; she is
not so far out of her senses neither.
Letty is no fool,” says the youngest sis∣ter:
“Do you think she has learned to
say No, any more than other people?”</P>
<P>“No, Mrs. Mirth-wit,” says Ro∣bert,
“Mrs. Letty's no fool; but Mrs.
Letty may be engaged some other way,
and what then?”</P>
<P>“Nay,” says the eldest sister, “we
can say nothing to that: Who must it
be to then? She is never out of doors,
it must be between you.”</P>
<P>“I have nothing to say to that,” says
Robert, “I have been examined enough;
there is my brother James, if it must
be between us, go to work with him.”</P>
<P>This stung the elder brother to the
quick, and he concluded that Robert
had discovered something: however, he
kept himself from appearing disturbed.
“Prithee,” says he, “do not go to
sham your stories off upon me, I tell
you▪ I deal in no such ware; I have no∣thing
to say to Mrs. Letty, nor to any
<PB N="50" REF="58"/>
of the Miss Letties in the parish;” and
with that he rose up and went away.</P>
<P>“No,” says the eldest sister, “I dare
answer for him; my brother, I know,
knows the world better.”</P>
<P>Thus the discourse ended; but it left
the elder brother quite confounded: he
concluded his brother Robert had made
a full discovery, and he began to doubt,
whether I had been concerned in it, or
not; but with all his management, he
could not bring it about to get at me;
at last, he was so perplexed, that he
was quite desperate, and resolved he
would come into my chamber and see
me, whatever came of it; in order to
this, he contrived it so, that one day af∣ter
dinner, watching his eldest sister, till
he could see her go up stairs, he runs
after her: “Sister,” says he, “where
is this sick girl? may not a body see
her?”</P>
<P>“Yes,” says the sister, “I believe
you may; but let me go first a little,
and I will tell you.”</P>
<P>So she run up to the door, and gave
notice; and presently called to him:
<PB N="51" REF="59"/>
“Brother, you may come if you please.”
So in he came.</P>
<P>“Well,” says he, at the door, as he
came in, “where is this sick body that
is in love? How do ye do, Mrs. Let∣ty?”</P>
<P>I would have got up out of my
chair, but was so weak I could not, and
he saw it and his sister too; and she said,
“Come, do not strive to stand up; my
brother desires no ceremony, especially
now you are so weak.”</P>
<P>“No, No, Mrs. Letty, pray sit still,”
says he; and so sits himself down in a
chair over against me, and appeared as
if he was mightily pleased.</P>
<P>He talked a deal to his sister, and to
me; sometimes of one thing, sometimes
of another, on purpose to amuse her;
and every now and then, would turn it
upon the old story, directing it to me.
“Poor Mrs. Letty, it is a sad thing
to be in love; why it has reduced you
sadly.”</P>
<P>At last I spoke a little: I am glad
to see you so merry, Sir, but I think
the doctor might have found some∣thing
better to do than to make his
<PB N="52" REF="60"/>
game at his patient: if I had been ill of
no other distemper, I know the proverb
too well to have let him come to
me.”</P>
<P>“What proverb?” says he: “O! I
remember it now.</P>
<P>Where Love is the case,
The Doctor's an ass.</P>
<P>Is not that it, Mrs. Letty?”</P>
<P>I smiled, and said nothing.</P>
<P>“Nay,” says he, “I think the effect
has proved it to be love; for it seems
the doctor has been able to do you but
little service, you mend very slowly they
say: I doubt there is something in it,
Mrs. Letty.”</P>
<P>I smiled and said, “No, indeed,
Sir, that is none of my distemper.”</P>
<P>We had a deal of such discourse, and
sometimes other that signified as little;
by and by he asked me to sing them a
song; at which I smiled, and said, “My
singing days are over.”</P>
<P>At last he asked me, if he should
play upon his flute to me. His sister
said, she believed it would hurt me, and
<PB N="53" REF="61"/>
that my head could not bear it. I
bowed and said, “No, it would not
hurt me”</P>
<P>Then his sister said, “Do then, bro∣ther.”</P>
<P>With that he pulled out the key of
his closet, “Dear sister,” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays he, “I
am very lazy, do, step to my closet
and fetch my flute; it lies in such a
drawer,” naming a place where he was
sure it was not, that she might be some
time looking for it.</P>
<P>As soon as she was gone, he related
the discourse his brother had about me,
and his own concern about it, which was
the reason of his contriving this visit to
me. I assured him, I had never opened
my mouth either to his brother, or to
any body else: I told him the dreadful
exigence I was in; that my love to him,
and his offering to have me forget that
affection, and remove it to another, had
thrown me down; and that I had a thou∣sand
times wished I might die, rather
than recover, and to have the same cir∣cumstances
to struggle with as I had be∣fore;
and that this backwardness to life,
had been the great reason of the slow∣ness
<PB N="54" REF="62"/>
of my recovering: I added, I fore∣saw,
that as soon as I was well, I must quit
the family: and as for marrying his bro∣ther,
I abhorred the thoughts of it, after
what had been my case with him, and
that he might depend upon it, I would ne∣ver
see his, brother again upon that sub∣ject:
that if he would break all his vows
and oaths and engagements with me,
be that between his conscience and his
honour, and himself: but he should ne∣ver
be able to say, that I who he had
persuaded to call myself his wife, and
who had given him the liberty to use
me as a wife, was not as faithful to him
as a wife ought to be, whatever he might
be to me.</P>
<P>He was going to reply, and had said,
that he was sorry I could not be per∣suaded,
and was going to say more, but
he heard his sister a coming, and so did
I; and yet I forced out these few words
as a reply, that I could never be persuad∣ed
to love one brother, and marry ano∣ther.
He shook his head and said,
“Then I am ruined,” meaning himself;
and that moment his sister entered the
room, and told him she could not find
<PB N="55" REF="63"/>
the flute. “Well,” says he, merrily,
“this laziness won't do:” so he gets up
and goes himself to look for it, but
comes back without it too; not but that
he could have found it, but because his
mind was disturbed, and he had no mind
to play; and besides, the errand he sent
his sister upon, was answered another
way; as he only wanted an opportuni∣ty
to speak to me, which he gained,
though not much to his satisfaction.</P>
<P>I had, however, a great deal of sa∣tisfaction
in having spoken my mind to
him with freedom, and with such an
honest plainness as I have related; and
though it did not at all work that way,
I desired, that is to say, to oblige the
person to me the more; yet it took
from him all possibility of quitting me,
but by a down right breach of honour,
and giving up all the faith of a gentle∣man
to me, which he had so often en∣gaged
by, never to abandon me, but to
make me his wife as soon as he came to
his estate.</P>
<P>It was not many weeks after this, be∣fore▪
I was about the house again, and
began to grow well; but I continued
<PB N="56" REF="64"/>
melancholy, silent, dull, and retired,
which amazed the whole family, except∣ing
he, that knew the reason of it; yet
it was great while before he took any
notice of it, and I as backward to speak
as he, carried respectfully to him, but
never offered to speak a word to him,
that was particular of any kind whatso∣ever;
and this continued for sixteen or
seventeen weeks, so that as I expected
every day to be dismissed the family, on
account of the distaste they had taken
another way, in which I had no guilt,
so I expected to hear no more of him,
after all his solemn vows and protesta∣tions,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut to be ruined and abandon∣ed.</P>
<P>At last I broke the way myself in the
family, for my removal; for being talk∣ing
seriously with the old lady, one day,
abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t my own circumstances in the
world, and how my distemper had left a
heaviness▪ on my spirits that I was not the
same thing I was before; the old lady
replied, “I am afraid Letty, what I have
said to you about my son, has had some
influence upon you, and that you are
melancholy on his account; pray will
<PB N="57" REF="65"/>
you let me know how the matter stands
with you both, if it may not be im∣proper?
for as for Robert he does no∣thing
but rally and banter when I speak
of it.”</P>
<P>“Truly, madam, that matter stands
as I wish it did not, and I shall be very
sincere with you, whatever befalls me
for it. Mr. Robert has several times
proposed marriage to me, which is what
I had no reason to expect, my circum∣stances
considered; but I have always
resisted him, and, perhaps, in terms
more positive then became me, consi∣dering
the regard I ought to have for
every branch of your family: but, ma∣dam,
I could never so far forget my
obligations to you, and all your house,
to offer to consent to a thing, which I
know must be disobliging to you; and
this I have made my argument to him,
and have positively told him, that I
would never entertain a thought of that
kind, unless I had your consent and his
father's also, to whom I was bound by
so many invincible obligations.”</P>
<P>“And is this possible, Letty?” says
the old lady; “then you have been jus∣ter
<PB N="58" REF="66"/>
to us, than we have been to you;
for we have all looked upon you as a
kind of a snare to my son; and I had a
proposal to make to you, for your re∣moving,
for fear of it; but I have not
yet mentioned it to you, because I
thought you were not thoroughly well,
and I was afraid of grieving you too
much, lest it should throw you down
again, for we have all a respect for you
still, though not so much as to have it
be the ruin of my son; but if it be as
you say, we have all wronged you great∣ly.”</P>
<P>“As to the truth of what I say, ma∣dam,
I refer you to your son himself; if
he will do me justice, he must tell you
the story as I have told it.”</P>
<P>Away went the old lady to her daugh∣ters,
and tells them the whole story, and
they were surprised at it, as I believed
they would be: one said she could never
have thought it; another said, Robert
was a fool; a third said, she would not
believe a word of it, and she would
warrant that Robert would tell the story
another way; but the old lady, who was
resolved to go to the bottom of it, be∣fore
<PB N="59" REF="67"/>
I could have the least opportunity
of acquainting him with what had pass∣ed,
resolved too, that she would talk to
her son immediately, and to that pur∣pose
sent for him.</P>
<P>Upon his coming up to them, for
they were all still together; “ Sit down,
Robert,” says the old lady, “I must
have some talk with you.”</P>
<P>“With all my heart, madam,” says
he, looking very merry: “I hope it is
about a good wife; for I am at a great
loss in that affair.”</P>
<P>“How can that be?” says his mo∣ther;
“did not you say, you resolved
to have Letty.”</P>
<P>“Ay, madam, but there is one has
forbid the banns.”</P>
<P>“Forbid the banns!” says his mo∣ther?
“who can that be.”</P>
<P>“Even Mrs. Letty herself,” says Ro∣bert.</P>
<P>“How so?” says his mother; “have
you asked her the question then?”</P>
<P>“Yes, indeed, madam, I have at∣tacked
her in form five times since she
was sick, and am beaten off; the jade is
so stout, she will not capitulate, nor
<PB N="60" REF="68"/>
yield upon any terms, except such as I
cannot effectually grant.”</P>
<P>“Explain yourself,” says his mother,
“for I am surprised! I do not under∣stand
you; I hope you are not in earnest.”</P>
<P>“Why, madam, the case is plain
enough upon me; it explains itself: she
will not have me, she says. Is not that
plain enough? I think it is plain, and
pretty rough too.”</P>
<P>“Well, but,” says the mother, “you
talk of conditions, that you cannot
grant. What! does she want a settle∣ment?
Her jointure ought to be accord∣ing
to her portion; but what fortune
does she bring you?”</P>
<P>“Nay, as to fortune” says Robert,
“she is rich enough; I am satisfied in
that point: but it is I that am not able
to come up to her terms, and she is po∣sitive
she will not have me without.”</P>
<P>“Madam,” says the second sister, “it
is impossible to be serious with him; he
will never give a direct answer to any
thing; you had better let him alone,
and talk no more of it to him; you
know how to dispose of her out of his
<PB N="61" REF="69"/>
way, if you think there is any thing in
it.”</P>
<P>Robert was a little warm with his
sister's rudeness, but he was even with
her; and yet with good manners too.</P>
<P>“There are two sorts of people, ma∣dam,”
says he, turning to his mother,
“that there is no contending with; that
is, a wise body and a fool; it is a little
hard I should engage with both of them
together.”</P>
<P>The younger sister then said, “We
must be fools, indeed, in my brother's
opinion, that he should think we can
believe, he has seriously asked Mrs. Let∣ty
to marry him, and that she has re∣fused
him.”</P>
<P>“Answer, and answer not, says So∣lomon,”
replied he; “when your bro∣ther
had said to your mother, that he
had asked her no less than five times,
and that it was so, that she positively
denied him, methinks a younger sister
need not question the truth, when her
mother did not.”</P>
<P>“My mother, you see, did not un∣derstand
it,” says the second sister.”</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="70"/>
“There is some difference,” says Ro∣ber,
“between desiring me to explain
it, and telling me she did not believe
it.”</P>
<P>“Well, but son,” says the old lady,
“if you are disposed to let us into the
mystery of it: What were these hard
conditions?”</P>
<P>“Yes, madam,” says Robert, “I
had done it before now, if the teazers
here had not worried me by the way of
interruption: the conditions are, that I
bring my father and you to consent to
it, and without that, she protests she
will never see me more upon that sub∣ject;
and these conditions, as I said, I
suppose I shall never be able to grant.
I hope my warm sisters will be answered
now, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ush a little; if not, I have
no more to say, till I hear farther.”</P>
<P>This answer was surprising to them
all, though less to the mother, because
of what I had said to her. As to the
daughters they stood silent a great while;
but the mother said with some warmth,</P>
<P>“Well, I had heard this before, but I
could not believe it; but if it is so,
then we have all done Letty wrong, and
<PB N="63" REF="71"/>
she has behaved better than I ever ex∣pected.”</P>
<P>“Nay,” says the elder sister, “if
it is so, she has acted handsomely, in∣deed.”</P>
<P>I confess,” says the mother, “it
was none of her fault; if he was fool
enough to take a fancy to her; but to
give such an answer to him, shews more
respect to your father and me, than I
can tell how to express; I shall value
the girl the better for it, as long as I
know her.”</P>
<P>“But I shall not,” says Robert, “un∣less
you give your consent.”</P>
<P>“I will consider of that,” says the
mother: “I assure you, if there were
not some other objections, this conduct
of her's would go a great away to bring
me to consent.”</P>
<P>“I wish it would go quite through
with it,” says Robert; “if you had as
much thought about making me easy, as
you have about making me rich, you
would soon consent to it.”</P>
<P>“Why, son Robert, are you really
in earnest? would you so fain have her
as you pretend?”</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="72"/>
“Really, madam,” says he, “I think
it is hard you should question me so, af∣ter
all I have faid: I won't say that I
will have her: how can I resolve that
point, when you see I cannot have her
without your consent? besides, I am
not bound to marry at all: but this I
will say I am earnest in, that I will ne∣ver
have any body else: so you may de∣termine
for me, Letty, or nobody, is
the word; and the question which of the
two shall be in your breast to decide
madam; provided only, that my good∣humoured
sisters here, may have no
vote in it.”</P>
<P>All this was dreadful to me, for the
mother began to yield, and Robert press∣ed
her home in it; on the other hand,
she advised with the eldest son, and he
used all the arguments he was master of
to persude her to consent; alledging
his brother's passionate love for me, and
my generous regard to the family, in re∣fusing
my own advantages upon such
a nice point of honour, and a thousand
such, things: and as to the father, he
was a man in a hurry of public affairs,
and getting money, seldom at home,
<PB N="65" REF="73"/>
thoughtful of the main-chance; but left
all those things to his wife.</P>
<P>You may easily believe, that when
the plot was thus, as they imagined,
broke out, that every one thought they
knew how things were carried: it was
not so difficult or so dangerous, for the
elder brother, who nobody suspected of
any thing, to have a freer access to me
than before: nay, the mother, which
was just as he wished, proposed it to
him to talk with me; “for it may be,
son, you may see farther into the thing
than I; and see if you think she has
been so positive as Robert says she has
been, or no.”</P>
<P>This was as well as he could wish,
and he as it were yielding to talk with
me at his mother's request, she brought
me to him into her chamber; told me
her son James had some business with
me, at her request, and desired me to
be very sincere with him; and then she
left us both together, and he went and
shut the door after her.</P>
<P>He then came and took me in his
arms and kissed me very tenderly; but
told me, he had a long discourse to hold
<PB N="66" REF="74"/>
with me, and it was now come to that
crisis, that I should make myself happy
or miserable, as long as I lived: that
the affair was now gone so far, that if I
could not comply with his desire, we
should be both ruined: then he told me
the whole story as has been related.
“And now, my dear,” says he, “con∣sider
what it will be to marry a gentle∣man
of a good family, and with the
consent of the whole house, and to en∣joy
all that the world can give you: and
what on the other hand, to be sunk in∣to
the dark circumstances of a woman
that has lost her reputation; and that,
though I shall be a private friend to you
while I live, yet, as I shall be suspected
always, so you will be afraid to see me,
and I shall be afraid to own you.”</P>
<P>He gave me no time to reply, but
went on with me thus: “What has
happened between us, so long as we
both agree to do so, may be buried and
forgotten: I shall always be your sincere
friend, without any inclination to nearer
intimacy, when you become my sister,
and we shall have all the honest part of
conversation without any reproaches be∣tween
<PB N="67" REF="75"/>
us, of having done amiss. I beg
of you to consider it, and do not stand
in the way of your own safety and pros∣perity;
and to satisfy you that I am sin∣cere,
I here offer you five hundred
pounds to make you some amends for
the freedoms I have taken with you,
which we shall look upon as some of
the follies of our lives, which it is hoped
we may repent of.”</P>
<P>He spoke this in so much more mov∣ing
terms than it is possible for me to
express, and much greater force of ar∣gument
than I can repeat, that I only
recommend it to those who read my
story, to suppose, that as he held me
above an hour and half in that discourse,
so he answered my objections with all the
arguments that human wit and art could
devise.</P>
<P>I cannot say, however, that any thing
he said made impression enough upon
me, so as to give me any thought of the
matter; till he told me at last very plain∣ly,
that if I refused, he was sorry to
add, that he could never go on with me
in that station as we stood before; that
though he loved me as well as ever, and
<PB N="68" REF="76"/>
that I was as agreeable to him, as ever,
yet, sense of virtue had not so far for∣saken
him, as to suffer him to take free∣doms
with a woman that his brother
courted to make his wife; and if he
took his leave of me, with a denial in
this affair, whatever he might do for me in
the point of support, grounded on his
first engagement of maintaining me, yet
he would not have me be surprised, that
he was obliged to tell me, he could not
allow himself such liberties any more,
and that I could not expect it of him.</P>
<P>I received this last part with some to∣kens
of surprise and disorder, and much
ado, to avoid sinking; for, indeed, I
loved him to an extravagance, not easy
to imagine; but he perceived my disor∣der,
he entreated me to consider serious∣ly
of it, assured me, that it was the on∣ly
way to preserve our mutual affection;
that in this station we might love as
friends, with the utmost passion, and
with a love of relation untainted, free
from our just reproaches, and free from
other peoples suspicions; that he should
ever acknowledge his happiness owing to
me; that he would be debtor to me as
<PB N="69" REF="77"/>
long as he lived, and would be paying
that debt as long as he had breath. Thus
he wrought me up, in short, to a hesi∣tation
in the matter: having the dan∣gers
on one side represented in lively fi∣fiures,
and, indeed, heightened by my
imagination of being turned out to the
wide world a mere cast-off mistress,
for it was no less, and perhaps exposed
as such; with little to provide for my∣self;
with no friend, no acquaintance in
the whole world, out of that town, and
there I could not pretend to stay; all
this terrified me to the last degree, and
he took care upon all occasions to lay it
home to me, in the worst colours that it
could be possible to be drawn in. On
the other hand, he failed not to set
forth the easy prosperous life, which I
was going to live.</P>
<P>He answered all that I could object
from affection, and from former engage∣ments,
with telling me the necessity that
was before us of taking our measures
now; and as to his promises of mar∣riage,
the nature of things, he said, had
put an end to that, by the probability
of my being his brother's wife, before
<PB N="70" REF="78"/>
the time to which his promises all re∣ferred.</P>
<P>Thus in a word, I may say, he rea∣soned
me out of my reason; he con∣quered
all my arguments, and I began
to see a danger that I was in, which I
had not considered of before, and that
was, of being dropped by both of them,
and left alone in the world to shift for
myself.</P>
<P>He having thus managed me, his next
business was to manage his mother; and
he never left her till he had brought her
to acquiesce, and be passive in the thing,
even without acquainting his father,
other than by letters: so that she con∣sented
to our marrying privately, and
leaving her to manage his father after∣wards.</P>
<P>Robert, having obtained his mother's
consent, came big with the news to me,
and related the whole story, with a since∣rity
so visible, that I confess it grieved
me to think I was the instrument to
abuse so honest a young gentleman; but
there was no remedy: he would have
me, and I was not obliged to acquaint
him with all I knew, though I had no
<PB N="71" REF="79"/>
other way to put him off; so I came
gradually into it, to his satisfaction, and,
accordingly we were married.</P>
<P>It concerns the story very little, to en∣ter
into the farther particulars of the fa∣mily,
or of myself, for the five years
that I lived with my husband; only to
observe that I had two children by him,
and that at the end of five years he died.
He had been really a very good husband
to me, and we lived very agreeably to∣gether;
but as he had not received much
from them, and had, in the little time he
lived, acquired no great matters, so my
circumstances were not much mended
by the match: indeed, I had preserved
the elder brother's bonds to me, to pay
me 500l. which he offered me for my
consent to marry his brother; and this,
with what I had saved of the money he
formerly gave me, and as much more
by my husband, left me a widow with
about 1200l.</P>
<P>My two children were indeed taken
happily off my hands by my husband's
father and mother, and that was all
they got by me.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="80"/>
Before my husband died, his elder
brother was married, and we being then
removed to London, were written to by
the old lady to come and be at the wed∣ding.
My husband went; but I pretend∣ed
indisposition, and that I could not
possibly travel, so I staid behind; for in
short, I could not bear the sight of his
being given to another woman, though
I knew I was never to have him my∣self.</P>
<P>I was now left loose to the world, and
being still young and handsome, as every
body said of me, and I assure you, I
thought myself so, and with a tolerable
fortune, I put no small value upon my∣self.
I was courted by several consider∣able
tradefmen; and particularly, very
warmly by one, a linen-draper, at whose
house, after my husband's death, I took
a lodging, his sister being my acquaint∣ance:
here I had all the liberty, and all
the opportunity to be gay, and appear
in company that I could desire. My
landlord's sister being an extreme gay
woman, and not so much mistress of her
virtue, as I thought at first she had
been, she brought me into a world of
<PB N="73" REF="81"/>
company, and even brought home se¦veral
persons, such as she liked well
enough to gratify, to see her pretty wi∣dow,
so she was pleased to call me, and
that name I got in a little time in pub∣lick.
Now, as Fame and Fools make
an assembly, I was here wonderfully
caressed; had abundance of admirers,
and such as called themselves Lovers;
but I found not one fair proposal among
them all: as for their common design,
I understood too well to be drawn
into any more snares of that kind. The
case was altered with me: I had money
in my pocket, and had nothing to say to
them. I had been tricked once by that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heat called Love, but the game was
over; I was resolved now to be married,
or nothing; and to be well married, or
at all.</P>
<P>I loved the company, indeed, of men
of mirth and wit, men of gallantry and
sigure, and was often entertained with
such, as I was also with others; but I
found by observation, that the brightest
men came upon the dullest errand; that
is to say, the dullest, as to what I aim∣ed
at: on the other hand, those who
<PB N="74" REF="82"/>
came with the best proposals, were the
dullest and most disagreeable part of the
world. I was not averse to a tradesman;
but then I would have a tradesman, that
was something of a gentleman too.</P>
<P>At last I found a gentleman-trades∣man;
and, as a just plague upon my
folly, I was catched in the very snare,
which, as I may say, I laid for ano∣ther.</P>
<P>This was a draper too, for though my
female acquaintance would have brought
me to a bargain with her brother, yet
when it came to the point, it was it
seems for a mistress, not a wife; and I
kept true to this notion, that a woman
should never be kept for a mistress, that
had money to keep herself.</P>
<P>Thus my pride, not my principle, my
money, nor my virtue, kept me honest;
though, as it proved, I found I had
much better have been sold by my fe∣male
friend to her brother, than have
sold myself as I did to one who was a
rake, gentleman, shop-keeper, and beg∣gar
all together.</P>
<P>But I was hurried on to ruin myself
in the grossest manner that ever woman
<PB N="75" REF="83"/>
did; for my husband coming to a sum
of money at once, fell into such a pro∣fusion
of expence, that all I had, and
all he had before, if he had any thing
worth mentioning, would not have held
it out long.</P>
<P>He was very fond of me for about
a quarter of a year, and what I got by
that, was, that I had the pleasure of
seeing a great deal of my money spent
upon myself, and as I may say, had
some of the spending it too. “Come,
my dear,” says he to me one day, “shall
we go and take a journey in the coun∣try
for about a week?”</P>
<P>“Ay, my love,” says I; “where
would you go?”</P>
<P>“I care not whither,” says he, “but
I have a mind to go to Oxford;” and to
Oxford we went, and a very pleasant
journey we had; and in about twelve
days came home again, after spending
near fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Vanity is the perfection of a fop:
my husband had this excellence, and as
his history you may be sure, has little
weight in it, it is enough to tell you,
<PB N="76" REF="84"/>
that in about two years and a quarter he
was arrested.</P>
<P>It was no surprise to me, for I had
foreseen some time that all was going to
wreck, and had been taking care to re∣serve
something if I could, though it
was not much for myself: but when he
sent for me, he behaved much better
than I expected, and told me, he had
played the fool and suffered himself to
be surprised which he might have pre∣vented;
that now he foresaw he could
not stand it, and therefore he would have
me go home, take away every thing I
had in the house of any value and se∣cure
it; and after that, he told me,
that “if I could get away the goods
out of the shop, I should do it; only
let me know nothing of it, neither what
you take, or whither you carry them;
for as for me, I am resolved to get out
of this house and be gone; and if you
never hear of me more, my dear, I wish
you well; I am only sorry for the inju∣ry
I have done you.”</P>
<P>He said some very handsome things
to me at parting; for I told you he was
a gentleman, and that was all the benefit
<PB N="77" REF="85"/>
I had of his being so; that he used me
very handsomely, and with good man∣ners
upon all occasions, even to the last,
only spent all I had, and left me to rob
the creditors for something to subsist on.</P>
<P>However, I did as he bade me, and
having thus taken my leave of him, I
never saw him more; for he found
means to break out of the bailiff's
house that night, and for the rest the
creditors scrambled for it as well as they
could: how I knew not, for I could
come at no knowlege of any thing, more
than this; that he having raised what
money he could get together, he got
over to France, from whence I had one
or two letters from him, and no more.</P>
<P>My husband was so civil to me, for
still I say, he was much of a gentleman,
that in the first letter from France, he
let me know where he had pawn∣ed
twenty pieces of fine Holland for
thirty pounds, and inclosed the to∣ken,
and an order for taking them
up, which I did, and made in time a∣bove
an hundred pounds of them, hav∣ing
leisure to cut them and sell them,
to private families as opportunity offered.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="86"/>
However, with all this, and all that
I had secured before, I found, upon cast∣ing
things up, my case was very much
altered, and my fortune much lessened;
for including the hollands, and a parcel
of fine muslins, which I carried off be∣fore,
and some plate, and other things,
I found I could hardly muster up five hun∣dred
pounds, and my condition was very
odd, for though I had no child, I had had
one by him, but it died, yet I was a wi∣dow
betwitched; I had a husband and
no husband, and I could not pretend to
marry again, though I knew well enough
my husband would never see England
any more, if he lived fifty years: thus,
I say, I was limited from marriage, what
offer soever might be made me; and I
had not one friend to advise with, in the
condition I was in, at least not one I
durst trust the secret of my circum∣stances
to: for if the commissioners were
to have been informed where I was,
I should have been fetched up, and exa∣mined
upon oath, and all I had saved
be taken away from me.</P>
<P>Upon these apprehensions the first
thing I did, was to go by another name:
<PB N="79" REF="87"/>
this I did effectually, for I took lodg∣ings
in a very private part of the town,
dressed myself in the habit of a widow,
and went by the name of Flanders.
This though a present relief, in conceal∣ing
myself from the creditors, yet the
name which I had assumed, occasioned
a reflection hereafter that shall be related
in its proper place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note upon this account, she took upon her∣self the name of Flanders.</NOTE></P>
<P>I soon made an acquaintance with a
very sober good sort of a woman, who
was really a widow, but in better cir∣cumstances;
her husband had been a
captain of a merchant ship, and having
had the misfortune to be cast away com∣ing
home on a voyage from the West-Indies,
which would have been very
profitable if he had come safe, was so
reduced by the loss, that though he had
saved his life then, it broke his heart and
killed him afterwards. She invited me
to be with her till I could settle to my
mind, or, as she said, get a husband.</P>
<P>I accepted her offer, and was with her
half a year, and should have been longer;
but in that interval what she proposed to
<PB N="80" REF="88"/>
me, happened to herself, and she marri∣ed
another captain very much to her
advantage, and whose fortune was upon
the increase; mine seemed to be upon
the wane.</P>
<P>As my sister-in-law, at Colchester, said,
“beauty, wit, manners, sense, good-hu∣mour,
good behaviour, education, vir∣tue,
or any other qualification, whether
of body or mind, had no power to re∣commend.
Money only made a woman
agreeable: men chose mistresses indeed
by the heat of their affection, and it was
requisite for them to be handsome, well-shaped,
and a graceful behaviour; but
for a wife, no deformity would shock
the fancy, no ill qualities the judg∣ment;
the money was the thing; the
portion was neither crooked or mon∣strous,
but the money was always a∣greeable,
whatever the wife was.”</P>
<P>The circumstances I was in, made
the offer of a good husband the most
necessary thing in the world to me; but
it soon began to be rumoured that I
had no fortune, and to say this, was to
say all that was ill of me; and I was
dropt in all the discourses of matrimo∣ny:
<PB N="81" REF="89"/>
tho' I was allowed to be well-bred,
handsome, witty, modest and agreeable;
yet, all these would not do without the
one thing needful, which was now be∣come
more valuable than virtue itself.
In short, “the widow,” they said, “had
no money.”</P>
<P>I resolved, therefore, as to the state of
my present circumstances, that it was
absolutely necessary to change my sta∣tion,
and make a new appearance in
some other place where I was not known,
and even to pass by another name if I
found occasion.</P>
<P>I communicated my thoughts to my
intimate friend the captain's lady, who
was as ready to serve me as I could de∣sire.
I made no scruple to lay my cir∣cumstances
open to her. I told her I
had about five hundred pounds, a great
many very rich clothes, a gold watch,
and some jewels, though of no extraor∣dinary
value.</P>
<P>She said if I would be ruled by her I
should certainly get a husband of for∣tune,
without leaving him any room to
reproach me. I answered her, as I had
reason to do, that I would give up my∣self
<PB N="82" REF="90"/>
wholly to her directions, and that
I would have neither tongue to speak,
or feet to step, in that affair, but as
she should direct me; depending that
she would extricate me out of eve∣ry
difficulty that she brought me in∣to,
which she said she would answer
for.</P>
<P>The first step she put me upon, was
to call her cousin, and go to a relation's
of her's in the country, where she di∣rected
me, and where she brought her
husband to visit me: and calling me
cousin, she worked matters so about,
that her husband and she together in∣vited
me to come to town and be with
them, for they now lived in a different
place from where they were before.
She acquainted her husband, that I
had at least two thousand pounds for∣tune,
and that after some of my re∣lations
I was like to have a great deal
more.</P>
<P>It was enough to tell her husband this,
there needed nothing on my side; I was
but to sit still and wait the event, for it
presently went all over the neighbour∣hood
that the young widow at Captain
<PB N="83" REF="91"/>
Jolly's had at least two thousand pounds,
and perhaps a great deal more, and that
the captain said so; and if the cap∣tain
was asked at any time about me, he
made no scruple to affirm it, though he
knew not one word of the matter, than
that his wife had told him so; and in
this he thought no harm, for he really
believed it to be so, because he had it
from his wife; so slender a foundation
will men build upon, if they do but
think there is a fortune in the way.
With the reputation of this fortune, a
Mr. Bennet, a rich Virginia planter,
a very agreeable man, made his addresses
to me, and told me as I was a woman of
his choice, he hoped I would make him
happy in accepting of him for a hus∣band:
this I imagined was upon sup∣position
that I was very rich, though I
had never told him a word of it myself;
and pretended, on all occasions, to doubt
his sincerity; and, added, perhaps he
only courted me in expectation of my
being a fortune.</P>
<P>He replied, though not verbally, by
pulling off his diamond ring, and writes
<PB N="84" REF="92"/>
upon the glass of the sash in my cham∣ber,
<Q>You I love, and you alone.</Q>
I read it, and wrote under it,
<Q>And so, in love, says every one.</Q>
He takes his ring again, and writes,
<Q>Virtue alone is an estate.</Q>
I added,
<Q>But money's virtue; gold is fate.</Q>
He coloured as red as fire to see me turn
so quick upon him, and told me he
would conquer me, and writes,
<Q>I scorn your gold, yet you I love.</Q>
I ventured all upon the last cast of poe∣try,
and I wrote,
<Q>I'm poor: let's see how kind you'll prove.</Q>
This was a sad truth to me: whether he
believed me or no I could not tell; I
supposed then that he did not. How∣ever,
he flew to me, took me in his
arms, and kissing me very eagerly, and
with the greatest warmth imaginable, he
held me fast till he called for a pen and
<PB N="85" REF="93"/>
ink, and then told me could not wait
the tedious writing on the glass, but
pulling out a piece of paper, he began
and wrote again,
<Q>Be mine, with all your poverty.</Q>
I took his pen and followed him imme∣diately
thus,
<Q>Yet, secretly, you hope I lie.</Q>
He told me that was unkind, because
it was not just, and that I put him upon
contradicting me, which did not consist
with good-manners, any more than with
his affection; and, therefore, since I had
insensibly drawn him into this poetical
scribble, he begged I would not oblige
him to break it off; so he writes again,
<Q>Yet love alone be our debate.</Q>
I answered.
<Q>She loves enough, that does not hate.</Q>
This he took for a favour, and so laid
down the pen. I say, he took it for a
favour, and a mighty one it was, if he
had known all: however, he took it as I
meant it, that is, to let him think I
<PB N="86" REF="94"/>
was inclined to go on with him, as in∣deed
I had all the reason in the world to
do, for he was the best-humoured merry
sort of a man that ever I met with; and
I often reflected on myself, how doubly
criminal it was to deceive him; but that
necessity, which pressed me to a settle∣ment
suitable to my condition, was my
authority for it: and certainly his affec∣tion
to me, and the goodness of his
temper, however they might argue a∣gainst
using him ill, yet they strongly
argued to me, that he would better take
the disappointment, than some fiery-tem∣pered
wretch, who might have nothing
to recommend him but those passions
which would serve only to make a wo∣man
miserable all her days.</P>
<P>Besides, though I had jested with him,
as he supposed it, so often about my
poverty; yet, whether he was in jest or
in earnest, he had declared he took me
without any regard to my portion; and
whether I was in jest or in earnest I had
declared myself to be very poor, so that
in a word, I had him fast both ways;
and though he might say afterwards he
<PB N="87" REF="95"/>
was cheated, yet he could never say that
I had cheated him.</P>
<P>He pursued me close after this, and
as I saw there was no need to fear losing
him, I played the indifferent part with
him longer than prudence might have
otherwise dictated to me: but I considered
how much this caution and indifference
would give me the advantage over him,
when I should come to be under the ne∣cessity
of owning my own circumstances
to him; and I managed it the more
warily, because I found he inferred from
thence, as indeed he ought to do, that
I either had the more money, or the
more judgment, and would not ven∣ture.</P>
<P>I took the freedom one day, after we
had talked pretty close on the subject, to
tell him, that it was true I had received
the compliment of a lover from him;
namely, that he would take me without
enquiring into my fortune, and I would
make him a suitable return in this, viz.
that I would make as little enquiry into
his as consisted with reason, but I hoped
he would allow me to ask a few ques∣tions,
which he should answer or not as
<PB N="88" REF="96"/>
he thought fit; and that I would not be
offended if he did not answer me at all:
one of these questions related to our
manner of living, and the place where;
because I had heard he had a great plan∣tation
in Virginia, and that he had talk∣ed
of going to live there.</P>
<P>He began from this discourse to let
me voluntarily into his affairs, and to
tell me in a frank open way all his cir∣cumstances,
by which I found he was
very well to pass in the world; but that
great part of his estate consisted of three
plantations which he had in Virginia,
which brought him in a very good in∣come,
generally speaking three hun∣dred
pounds a year; but that if he was
to live upon them, would bring him
twice as much.</P>
<P>I told him I had good reason not to
desire to go there to live, because if his
plantations were worth so much, I had
not a fortune suitable to a gentleman of
six hundred pounds a year, as he said
his estate would be.</P>
<P>He replied generously, he did not ask
what my fortune was, he had told me
from the beginning he would not, and
<PB N="89" REF="97"/>
he would be as good as his word; but
whatever it was, he assured me he would
never desire me to go to Virginia with
him, or go thither himself without me,
unless I was perfectly willing, and made
it my choice.</P>
<P>To be brief, in a short time after this
we were married, and very happily mar∣ried
on my side I assure you, as to the
man; for he was the best-humoured
creature that ever woman had.</P>
<P>Now I was painfully put to it to bring
him the little stock I had, and to let
him see it was no more; but there was
a necessity for it, so I took my oppor∣tunity
one day when we were alone, and
said, “My dear, we have been married
this fortnight, is it not time to let you
know whether you have got a wife with
something, or with nothing?”</P>
<P>“Your own time for that, my dear,”
says he. “I am satisfied that I have got
the wife I love, I have not troubled you
much, with my enquiry after it.”</P>
<P>“That is true,” said I; “but I have
a great difficulty upon me about it, which
I scarce know how to manage.”</P>
<P>“What is that, my dear?” says he.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="98"/>
“Why,” says I, “it is a little hard
upon me, and it is harder upon you; I
am told that captain Jolly has informed
you I had a great deal more money than
I ever pretended to have, and I am sure
I never employed him to do so.”</P>
<P>“Well,” says he, “captain Jolly
may have told me so; but what then? if
you have not so much, that may lie at
his door, but you never told me what
you had, so I have no reason to blame
you if you have nothing at all.”</P>
<P>“That is so just,” said I, “and so
generous, that it makes my having but
a little a double affliction to me.”</P>
<P>“The less you have, my dear,” says
he, “the worse for us both; but I hope
the affliction you speak of, is not caused
for fear I should be unkind to you; no,
no, if you have nothing tell me plain∣ly,
and at once. I may perhaps tell the
captain he has cheated me; but I can
never say that you have, for did you
not give it under your hand that you
were poor? and so I ought to expect you
to be.”</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, I am glad I have
not been concerned in deceiving you:
<PB N="91" REF="99"/>
that I am poor is too true, but not so
poor as to have nothing neither; so I
pulled out some bank bills, and gave
him about a hundred and sixty pounds.”</P>
<P>I had brought him so near to expect
nothing, by what I had said before, that
he owned it was more than he looked
for; and he did not question by my dis∣course
to him, but that my fine cloaths,
gold watch, and a diamond ring or two
had been all my fortune.</P>
<P>Thus I got over the fraud of cheat∣ing
a man into marrying me on pre∣tence
of a fortune; which, by the way,
I take to be one of the most dangerous
steps a woman can take, and in which
she runs the most hazard of being ill
used afterwards.</P>
<P>My husband, to give him his due,
was a man of infinite good-nature; but
being under a disappointment in his re∣turn
of his plantations, he discovered
many times his inclination of going over
to Virginia to live upon his estate; and
often would he magnify the way of liv∣ing
there, how cheap, how plentiful,
and how pleasant it was!</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="100"/>
I began presently to understand his
meaning, and I took him up very plain∣ly
one morning, and told him that I did
so; that his estate turned to little ac∣count
at this distance, compared to what
it would do if he lived upon the spot,
and that I found he had a mind to go
and live there; and I added, that I was
sensible he had been disappointed in me,
and that finding his expectations not an∣swered
that way, I could do no less to
make him amends than tell him, that I
was very willing to go over to Virginia
with him and live there.</P>
<P>He said a thousand kind things to me
upon the subject of my making such a
proposal to him: and added, that how∣ever
he was disappointed in his expec∣tations
of a fortune, he was not disap∣pointed
in a wife; and that I was all to
him that a wife could be, and he was
more than satisfied in the whole when the
particulars were put together; but that
this offer was so kind, that it was more
than he could express.</P>
<P>Accordingly we agreed to go. He told
me he had a very good house there,
that it was well furnished, that his mo∣ther
<PB N="93" REF="101"/>
was alive and lived in it, and one
sister, which was all the relations he
had; that as soon as he came there, his
mother would remove to another house
which was her own for life, and his af∣ter
her decease; so that I should have all
the house to myself.</P>
<P>To make this part of the story short,
we put on board a large quantity of good
furniture for our house, with stores of
linnen and other necessaries, and a good
cargo for sale, and away we went.</P>
<P>To give an account of the manner of
our voyage, which was long and full
of dangers, is out of my way, I kept
no journal, neither did my husband;
all that I can say is, that after a terrible
passage, frighted twice with dreadful
storms, and once with what was still
more terrible, I mean a pirate, who came
on board and took away almost all our
provisions; and which would have been
beyond all to me, they had once taken
my husband to go along with them, but
by entreaties were prevailed with to leave
him; I say, after all these terrible things,
we arrived in York River in Virginia, and
coming to our plantation, we were re∣ceived
<PB N="94" REF="102"/>
with all the demonstrations of
tenderness and affection by my husband's
mother, that were possible to be express∣ed.</P>
<P>We lived here all together, my mo∣ther-in-law,
who must have been a beau∣tiful
woman in her prime, at my entreaty,
continuing in the house, for she was too
kind a mother to be parted with; my
husband likewise continued the same as
at first, and I thought myself the hap∣piest
creature alive; when a surprising
event put an end to all that felici∣ty
in a moment, and rendered my con∣dition
the most uncomfortable, if not
the most miserable in the world.</P>
<P>My mother-in-law was a mighty chear∣ful
good-humoured old woman, I may
call her an old woman, for her son was
above thirty; I say she was very plea∣sant,
good company, and used to enter∣tain
me with abundance of stories to
divert me, as well of the country we
were in, as the people.</P>
<P>Among the rest, she told me how the
greatest part of the inhabitants of the
colony came thither in very indifferent
circumstances from England; that ge∣nerally
<PB N="95" REF="103"/>
speaking they were of two sorts,
first, such as were brought over by ma∣sters
of ships to be sold as servants, such
we call them, my dear, but they are
more properly called slaves: or, second∣ly,
such as are transported from Newgate
and other prisons, after having been
found guilty of felony and crimes pu∣nishable
with death.</P>
<P>“When they come here,” says she,
“we make no difference,” the planters
buy them, and they work together in the
field till their time is out: when it is ex∣pired,
they have encouragement given
them to plant for themselves; for they
have a certain number of acres of land
allotted them by the country, and they
go to work to clear and cure the land,
and then to plant it with tobacco and
corn for their own use; and as the trades∣men
and merchants will trust them with
tools and cloaths, and other necessaries,
upon the credit of their crop before it
is grown, so they again plant every year
a little more than the year before, and
buy whatever they want with the crop
that is before them.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="104"/>
“Hence child, many become great
men, and we have,” continued she, “se∣veral
justices of the peace, officers of the
train bands, and magistrates of the towns
they live in, that have been sent from
your side of the water.”</P>
<P>She was going on with that part of
the story, when her own part in it inter∣rupted
her, and with a great deal of
good-humoured confidence she told me,
she was one of the second sort of inha∣bitants
herself: that she one evening, at
the door of the Opera-house, was de∣tected
in being too familiar with a lady's
gold watch, for which she was convict∣ed;
but afterwards her sentence being
changed, she was, she blessed God, sent
hither for life.</P>
<P>This story, being similar to what I
had heard from my aunt Atkins of Col∣chester,
my father's sister, who brought
me up, moved me greatly; but my mo∣ther,
smiling, said, “You need not think
such a thing strange, daughter, for, as I
told you, some of the best men in this
county were brought here on the same
account, and they are not ashamed to
own it; there is major Sly, he was an
<PB N="97" REF="105"/>
eminent pickpocket; and justice Burg∣lary
was a shoplifter, and both of them
have reason to thank the ALMIGHTY for
the sentence they received.”</P>
<P>Here she went on with her own story,
and in so particular a manner, that I be∣gan
to be very uneasy, but coming to
one particular that required telling her
name, and pronouncing Atkins, I thought
I should have sunk down in the place.
She perceived I was out of order, and
asked me if I was not well, and what
ailed me? I told her I was so affected
with the melancholy story she had told,
and the terrible things she had gone
through, that it had overcome me; and
I begged of her to talk no more of
it.</P>
<P>“Why, my dear,” says she, “very
kindly, what need these things trouble
you? These passages were long before
your time, and they give me no trouble
at all now; nay, I look back on them
with a particular satisfaction, as they
have been a means to bring me to this
place.” Then she went on to tell me
how she very luckily fell into a good fa∣mily,
where behaving herself well, and
<PB N="98" REF="106"/>
her mistress dying, her master, Mr. Ben∣net,
married her, by whom she had my
husband and his sister, and that by her
diligence and good management after
her husband's death, she had improved
the plantations to such a degree as they
then were, so that most of the estate was
of her getting, not her husband's, for
she had been a widow upwards of
sixteen years.</P>
<P>I heard this part of the story with ve∣ry
little attention, because I wanted much
to retire and give vent to my passions,
which I did soon after; and let any one
judge what must be the anguish of my
mind, when I came to reflect, that this
was certainly no more or less than my
own mother.</P>
<P>I was now the most unhappy of wo∣men:
had the story never been told me,
all had been well; it had been no crime
to have lain with my husband, since as
to his being my relation, had I known
nothing of it.</P>
<P>Under this pressure of mind, I re∣vealed
all I knew to my mother, begged
her assistance in our separation, being
determined to leave the place.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="107"/>
It is impossible to express the astonish∣ment
she was in; she took me about the
neck and kissed me, crying most vehe∣mently
over me, without speaking one
word for a long time; at last she broke
out, “Unhappy child! what miserable
chance could bring thee hither? and in
the arms of my own son too! Dreadful
girl! why, we are all undone! Married
to thy own brother! three children, and
two alive, all of the same flesh and blood!
My son and my daughter lying together
as husband and wife! All confusion
and distraction for ever! Miserable fa∣mily!
what will become of us? what is
to be said? what is to be done? and
thus she run on for a great while, nor
had I any power to speak, or if I had,
did I know what to say, for every word
wounded me to the soul. With this
kind of amazement she promised me that
she would say nothing of it to her son,
till we had talked of it again.</P>
<P>It was not long before we had a se∣cond
conference upon the same subject;
but then it was with this misfortune,
that my mother's opinion and mine were
quite different from one another; for
<PB N="100" REF="108"/>
my mother's opinion was, that I should
conceal the whole affair intirely, and
continue with him as my husband, till
some event should make the discovery of
it convenient.</P>
<P>To encourage me to this, she promis∣ed
to make me easy in my circumstances,
and to leave me what she could at her
death, secured for me separately from
my husband; so that if it should come
out afterwards, I should not be left de∣stitute,
but be able to stand on my own
feet, and procure justice from him.</P>
<P>This proposal did not agree at all with
my judgment of the thing, though it
was very fair and kind in my mother;
but my thoughts run quite another
way.</P>
<P>As to keeping the secret in our own
breasts, and letting it all remain as it
was, I told her it was impossible; and I
asked her how she could think I could
bear the thought of lying with my own
brother.</P>
<P>In this directly opposite opinion to
one another my mother and I continued
a long time, and it was impossible to
reconcile our judgments: many disputes
<PB N="101" REF="109"/>
we had about it, but we could never
either of us yield our own, or bring
over the other.</P>
<P>At last I resolved on a desperate course,
and told my mother my resolution, viz.
that in short I would tell him of it my∣self.
My mother was frighted to the
last degree at the very thoughts of it;
but I bid her be easy, told her I would
do it gradually, and with all the art and
good humour I was mistress of, and
time it also as well as I could, taking
him in good humour too: I told her, I
did not question I should succeed in my
design, and we might part by consent,
and with a good agreement, for I might
love him well enough for a brother,
though I could not for a husband; and
this made me see there was an absolute
necessity of breaking the case to him
without any delay, which I did the next
evening with all the caution and reserve
imaginable.</P>
<P>As we were sitting and talking very
friendly together under a little auning,
which served as an arbour at the entrance
from our house into the garden, I
fetched a deep sigh, and said I was sorry
<PB N="102" REF="110"/>
to acquaint him there was an unhappy
circumstance in our case, which lay too
close to my heart, and which I knew not
how to break to him.</P>
<P>He importuned me to tell him what it
was. I told him I could not tell how
to do it; that while it was concealed
from him, I alone was unhappy; but if
he knew it also, we should be both so,
and that therefore to keep him in igno∣rance,
was the kindest thing I could do,
and it was on that account alone that I
kept a secret from him, the very keep∣ing
of which I thought would first or
last be my destruction.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express his surprise
at this relation, and the double importu∣nity
which he used with me to discover
it. He told me I could not be called
kind to him; nay, I could not be faith∣ful,
if I concealed it from him. I told
him I thought so too, and yet I could
not do it.</P>
<P>He then told me he was resolved not
to differ with me in any thing; and that,
therefore, he would importune me no
more about it, resolving to acquiesce in
whatever I did or said, only begged I
<PB N="103" REF="111"/>
would then agree, that whatever it was,
it should not interrupt our quiet and
our mutual kindness.</P>
<P>I answered him plainly, that I could
not say I was glad not to be importuned,
though I could not tell how to comply.
“But come, my dear,” said I; “what
conditions will you make with me upon
the opening this affair to you.”</P>
<P>“Any conditions in the world,” said
he, “that you can in reason desire of
me.”</P>
<P>“Well,” said I, “come give it me
under your hand, that if you do not
find I am in any fault, or that I am will∣ingly
concerned in the causes of the
misfortune that is to follow, you will
not blame me, or make me the sufferer
for that which I was intirely ignorant
of.”</P>
<P>“That,” says he, “is the most rea∣sonable
demand in the world, not to
blame you for that which is not your
fault; give me a pen and ink.”</P>
<P>So I ran in and fetched pen, ink, and
paper; and he wrote the condition down
in the very words I had promised, and
signed it with his name.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="112"/>
“Well,” says he, “what is the next,
my dear?”</P>
<P>“Why, the next is, that you will
not blame me for not discovering the se∣cret
before I knew it.”</P>
<P>“Very just again,” says he: “with
all my heart.”</P>
<P>So he wrote down that also and signed
it.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, I have but one con∣dition
more to make; and that is, that
as there is nobody concerned in it but
you and I, you shall not discover it to
any person, excepting to your own mo∣ther;
and that in all the measures you
shall take upon the discovery, as I am
equally concerned in it with you, though
as innocent as yourself, you shall do no∣thing
in a passion, nothing to my preju∣dice,
or to your mother's prejudice,
without my knowledge and consent.”</P>
<P>This much amazed him, and he wrote
down the words distinctly, but read
them over and over before he signed
them, hesitating at them, several times,
and repeating them, “my mother's pre∣judice!
and your prejudice! What
<PB N="105" REF="113"/>
mysterious thing can this be?” however,
at last he signed it.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, I'll ask you no
more under your hand; but as you are
to hear and to bear the most unexpected
and surprising event that, perhaps, ever
befel any family in the world, I beg you
to promise me you will receive it with
composure and a presence of mind sui∣table
to a man of sense.”</P>
<P>“I'll do my utmost,” says he, “up∣on
condition you will keep me no longer
in suspence, for you terrify me with all
these preliminaries.”</P>
<P>“Why then—It is this—I am not
your lawful wife—our children are ille∣gitimate—I
am your own sister—Born
of your own mother now alive, and in the
house, who is convinced of the truth,
not to be denied or contradicted.”</P>
<P>He turned pale, trembled, and look∣ed
wild. I said, “Remember your
promise, and receive it with presence of
mind; for who could have said more to
prepare you for it, than I have done?
therefore have patience and compose
yourself to hear it out, and I will make
it as short as I can.” With this, I told
<PB N="106" REF="114"/>
him how my mother came to discover it
to me, as the reader has been already
acquainted: “and now, my dear, you
will see reason for capitulations, and
that I neither have been the cause of this
matter, nor could be so, and that I
could know nothing of it before.”</P>
<P>“I am fully satisfied of that,” says
he, “but it is a dreadful surprise to me;
however, I know a remedy for it all,
and a remedy that shall put an end to all
your difficulties, without your going to
England.”</P>
<P>“That would be as strange,” said I,
“as all the rest.”</P>
<P>“No, no, I will make it easy, there
is nobody in the way, but myself.”</P>
<P>He looked a little disordered when he
said this, but I did not apprehend any
thing from it at that time, believing as
it used to be said, “that they who do
those things never talk of them; or that
they who talk of such things never do
them.”</P>
<P>From this time I observed he became
pensive and melancholy; and, as I
thought, a little distempered in his head.
I endeavoured to talk him into temper,
<PB N="107" REF="115"/>
and to reason him into a kind of scheme
for our government in the affair, and some∣times
he would be well, and talk with
some courage about it: but the weight
of it lay too heavy upon his thoughts;
in short, it went so far that he made two
attempts upon himself, and in one of
them had actually strangled himself, had
not our mother come into the room in
the very moment; but with the help of
a negro servant, she cut him down and
recovered him.</P>
<P>Things were now come to a lamentable
height: it preyed upon his spirits, and it
threw him into a lingering consumption.
In this distress I did not know what to
do: as his life was apparently declining,
it had been certainly my business to have
staid in the country; but my mind was
restless and uneasy; I hankered after
coming to England, and nothing would
satisfy me without it.</P>
<P>In short, by an unwearied importuni∣ty,
my husband was at last prevailed
with, and so my own fate pushing me
on, the way was made clear for me, and
my mother concurring, I obtained a ve∣ry
<PB N="108" REF="116"/>
good cargo for my coming to En∣gland.</P>
<P>When I parted with my brother, for
such I am now to call him; we agreed
that after I arrived he should pretend to
have an account that I was dead in Eng∣land,
and so might marry again when
he would. He promised and engaged
to me to correspond with me as a sister,
and to assist and support me as long as I
lived; and that if he died before me,
he would leave sufficient to his mother
to take care of me still, in the name of
a sister, and he was in some respect care∣ful
of me, when he heard of me; but
it was so oddly managed that I felt the
disappointments very sensible afterwards,
as you shall hear in its time.</P>
<P>I came away for England in the month
of August, after I had been eight years
in that country: and now a new scene of
misfortunes attended me, which, per∣haps,
few women have gone through the
like.</P>
<P>We had an indifferent good voyage
till we came just upon the coast of Eng∣land,
and where we arrived in two and
thirty days, but were then ruffled with
<PB N="109" REF="117"/>
two or three storms, one of which drove
us away to the coast of I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eland, and we
put in at Kingsale. We remained there
about thirteen days, got some refresh∣ment
on shore, and put to sea again:
though we met with very bad weather,
in which the ship sprung her main-mast;
at laft we got into Milford-Haven in
Wales, where though it was remote
from our port, I resolved to venture no
more upon the water; so getting my
cloaths and money on shore with my
bills of loading, I resolved to come for
London, and leave the ship to get to her
port as she could, which was to Bristol,
where my brother's correspondent liv∣er.</P>
<P>I got to London in about three weeks,
and shortly after I went to Bath, for as
I was still far from being old, so my
humour, which was always gay, conti∣nued
so to an extreme. I expected some∣thing
or other might happen in my way,
that might mend my circumstances, as
had been my case before.</P>
<P>The Bath is a place of gallantry, ex∣pensive,
and full of snares. I went thi∣ther
indeed in the view of taking any
<PB N="110" REF="118"/>
thing that might offer; but I must do
myself that justice, as to protest I knew
nothing amiss, I meant nothing but in
an honest way.</P>
<P>Here I stayed the whole latter season,
as it is called there, and contracted some
unhappy acquaintance, which rather
prompted the follies I fell afterwards
into, than fortified me against them. I
lived pleasantly, kept good company,
that is to say, fine gay company; but had
the discouragement to find this way of
living sunk me exceedingly, and that as
I had no settled income, so spending up∣on
the main stock was but a certain kind
of bleeding to death; and this gave me
many sad reflections in the intervals of
my other thoughts: however, I shook
them off, and still slattered myself that
something or other might offer for my
advantage.</P>
<P>But I was in the wrong place for it, I
was not now at Rotherhithe, where, if I
had set myself tolerably up, some honest sea
captain or other might have talked with
me upon the honourable terms of ma∣trimony;
but I was at the Bath where
men find a mistress sometimes, but very
<PB N="111" REF="119"/>
rarely look for a wife, and consequent∣ly
the particular acquaintances a woman
can expect to make there, must have
some tendency that way.</P>
<P>I spent the season very agreeably, for
though I had contracted some acquaint∣ance
with a gentleman, who came to the
Bath for his diversion, yet I had enter∣ed
into no felonious treaty; I had re∣sisted
some casual offers of gallantry, but
I was not wicked enough to come into
the crime for the mere vice of it; and I
had no extraordinary offers made me
that tempted me with the main thing
which I wanted.</P>
<P>However, I contracted an acquain∣tance
with a woman, in whose house I
lodged; who, though she did not keep
an ill house, yet had none of the best
principles in herself. I had on all oc∣casions
behaved so well as not to get
the least slur upon my reputation on
any account whatever; and all the men
that I had conversed with, were of so
good reputation that I had not given the
least reflection by conversing with them;
nor did any of them seem to think there
was room for a wicked correspondence,
<PB N="112" REF="120"/>
if they had any of them offered it; yet
there was one gentleman, who always
singled me out for the diversion of my
company, as he called it, which, as he
was pleased to say, was very agreeable
to him; but at that time there was no
more in it.</P>
<P>I had many melancholy hours at the
Bath, after all the company were gone;
and when the spring came on, she had
some persons of character that frequent∣ly
lodged in her house, and in particu∣lar
the gentleman who, as I said, singled
me out for his companion the winter
before; and he came down again with
another gentleman, and two servants,
and lodged in the same house. I su∣spected
that my landlady had invited
him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hither, letting him know that I
was still with her; but she denied it, and
protested to me that she did not.</P>
<P>This gentleman came down and con∣tinued
to single me out for his peculiar
confident as well as conversation: his
company was very agreeable to me, as
mine, if I might believe him, was to
him. He soon understood I was still a
widow; that I had arrived at Bristol from
<PB N="113" REF="121"/>
Virginia by the last ships; and that I
waited at Bath till the next Virginia fleet
should arrive, by which I expected con∣siderable
effects. I also understood by
him that he had a wife, but that the lady
was distempered in her head, and was
under the conduct of her own relations,
which he consented to, to avoid any re∣flections
that might be cast on him for
mismanaging her cure; and in the mean
time he came to the Bath to divert his
thoughts from the disturbance of such
a melancholy circumstance.</P>
<P>My landlady, who of her own ac∣cord
encouraged the correspondence on
all occasions, gave me an advantageous
character of him, as of a man of ho∣nour
and of virtue, as well as of a great
estate; and indeed I had a great deal of
reason to say so of him too; for though
we lodged both on a floor, and he had
frequently come into my chamber, even
when I was in bed, and I also into
his when he was in bed, yet he never of∣fered
any thing to me farther than a
kiss.</P>
<P>I frequently took notice to my land∣lady
of his exceeding modesty; and she
<PB N="114" REF="122"/>
as frequently replied, though she had
been acquainted with him for several
years, that she never knew him other∣ways;
and added, she thought I ought
to expect some gratification from him
for my company, for indeed he did, as
it were, engross me, and I was seldom
from him. I told her I had not given
him the least occasion to think I wanted
it, or that I would accept of it from
him. She said she would take that part
upon her; and the first time we were to∣gether
alone, after she had talked with
him, he began to enquire into my cir∣cumstances.
I told him, that though
my cargo of tobacco was damaged, yet
it was not quite lost; that the merchant
I had been consigned to had so honest∣ly
managed for me, that I had not want∣ed;
and that I hoped, with frugal ma∣nagement,
I should make it hold out
till more would come, which I expected
by the next fleet; that in the mean time
I had retrenched my expences, and
whereas, I kept a maid last season, now
I lived without; but I live, said I, as
well satisfied now as I did then; add∣ing,
that his company had been a means
<PB N="115" REF="123"/>
to make me live much more chearful∣ly
than otherwise I should have done,
for which I was much obliged to him;
and so I put off all room for any offer
for the present: however, it was not
long before he attacked me again, and
told me he found that I was backward
to trust him with the secret of my cir∣cumstances,
which he was sorry for;
assuring me he enquired into it with no
design to satisfy his own curiosity, but
merely to assist me, if there was any oc∣casion;
but since I would not own my∣self
to stand in need of any assistance,
he had but one thing more to desire of
me, and that was, that I would pro∣mise
him if, at any time, I was any way
streightened, or like to be so, I would
frankly tell him of it, and that I would
make use of him with the same freedom
that he made the offer; adding, I should
always find I had a true friend, though
perhaps I was afraid to trust him.</P>
<P>I omitted nothing that was fit to be
said by one infinitely obliged, to let him
know, that I had a due sense of his
kindness; and indeed from that time, I
did not appear so much reserved to him
<PB N="116" REF="124"/>
as I had done before, though still with∣in
the bounds of the strictest virtue on
both sides; but how free soever our con∣versation
was, I could not arrive to that
sort of freedom which he desired, name∣ly,
to tell him I wanted money, though
I was secretly very glad of his offer.</P>
<P>Some weeks passed after this, when
my landlady, who had often pressed me
to it, but found that I could not do it,
comes in bluntly to me when we were
together: “O widow, I have bad news
to tell you this morning.”</P>
<P>“What is it?” said I; are the Vir∣ginia
ships lost?” for that was my fear.</P>
<P>“No, no,” says she, but the man
you sent to Bristol yesterday for money
is come back, and says, He has brought
none.”</P>
<P>I could by no means like her project;
I thought it looked too much like
prompting him, which indeed he did not
want, and I saw clearly that I should
lose nothing by being backward to ask,
so I took her up short: “I cannot ima∣gine
why he should say so to you, for
I assure you he brought me all the mo∣ney
I sent him for, and here it is,” pull∣ing
<PB N="117" REF="125"/>
out my purse with about twelve gui∣neas
in it.</P>
<P>The next morning he and I talked of
it again, when I found he was fully sa∣tisfied,
and, smiling, said, he hoped I
would not want money and not tell him
of it, and that I had promised him other∣wise.
I told him I had been very much
dissatisfied at my landlady's talking the
day before of what she had nothing to
do with; but I supposed she wanted what
I owed her, which was about eight gui∣neas,
which I had resolved to give her,
and had accordingly given it her the
same night.</P>
<P>He was in a mighty good humour,
when he heard me say, I had paid her,
and it went off to some other discourse;
but the next morning he having heard
me about my room, he called to me.
I answering, he asked me to come into
his chamber, for he had something to
say to me which was of moment; after
some very kind expressions, he asked me
to let him see my purse. I immediately
put my hand into my pocket, and laugh∣ing
at him, pulled it out, and there was
in it three guineas and a half: he im∣mediately
<PB N="118" REF="126"/>
went to his escritore, and re∣turned
it to me again, filled with gold.</P>
<P>At the end of the season he talked of
returning to London, and asked me if I
would accompany him thither. I repli∣ed,
what would the world think of it?
that it would be neither to his credit or
mine; so that I neither assented, or dis∣sented.
While this was in agitation,
and before he was to leave Bath, he said,
he had a little business to do for a few
days, at a place called Shepton in So∣mersetshire.
Accordingly he went, and
was there taken very ill; upon which he
sent his man back to Bath to beg me that
I would hire a post-chaise and come over
to him. Before he went, he had left
some money, and other things of value
with me, and what to do with them I
did not know, but I secured them as
well as I could, locked up the lodgings,
and went to him, where I found him ve∣ry
ill indeed; however, I persuaded him
to be carried back in a litter, where there
was more help and better advice to be
had.</P>
<P>He consented, and I brought him to
the Bath: here he continued very ill of
<PB N="119" REF="127"/>
a fever, and kept his bed five weeks,
all which time I nursed him and tended
him myself, as much, and as carefully,
as if I had been his wife; indeed if I
had been his wife I could not have done
more: I sat up with him so often, that
at last he would let me sit up no longer,
and then I got a pallet-bed into his
room, and lay in it just at his bed's
feet.</P>
<P>I was indeed sensibly affected with his
condition, and with the apprehension
of losing such a friend as he was, and
was like to be to me, and I used to sit
and cry by him many hours together:
however, at last he grew better, and
gave hopes that he would recover, as in∣deed
he did, though very slowly.</P>
<P>Were it otherwise than what I am go∣ing
to say, I should not be backward to
disclose it, as it is apparent I have done
in other cases in this account; but I af∣firm,
that through all his conversation,
abating the freedom of coming into the
chamber when I or he was in bed, and
abating the necessary offices of attending
him night and day, when he was sick,
<PB N="120" REF="128"/>
there had not passed the least immodest
word or action between us.</P>
<P>After some time he gathered strength,
and grew well apace, and I would have
removed my bed, but he would not let
me, till he was able to venture himself
without any body to sit up with him,
and then I removed to my own cham∣ber.</P>
<P>He took many occasions to express
his sense of my tenderness and concern
for him; and when he grew quite well,
he made me a present of fifty guineas for
my care, and, as he called it, for ha∣zarding
my life to save his.</P>
<P>He observing me surprised, told me
as he had a sincere respect for me, and
knew my circumstances, that he thought
I had merited it from him, by giving
him my company so intirely as I had
done.</P>
<P>And now he made deep protestations
of a sincere inviolable affection for me,
but all along attested it to be with the
utmost reserve for my virtue, and his
own. I told him I was fully satisfied of
it. He carried it that length that he pro∣tested,
that if he was naked in bed with
<PB N="121" REF="129"/>
me, he would as sacredly preserve my
virtue, as he would defend it if I was
assaulted by a ravisher. I believed him,
and told him I did so: but this did not
satisfy him, he would wait for an op∣portunity
to give me an undoubted tes∣timony
of it.</P>
<P>It was some time after this that I had
occasion to go to Bristol; upon which
he hired me a post-chaise, and would
go with me; and now indeed our inti∣macy
increased. From Bristol he carri∣ed
me to Gloucester, which was meerly
a journey of pleasure to take the air;
and here we could have no lodging in
the inn but in one large chamber with
two beds in it.</P>
<P>The master of the house going up
with us to shew us his room, said, very
freely, “Sir, it is none of my business
to inquire whether the lady be your
spouse or no; but if not, you may lie as
honestly in those two beds as if you were
in two chambers.”</P>
<P>With that he pulls a great curtain
which drew quite cross the room, and
effectually divided the beds. “Well,”
<PB N="122" REF="130"/>
says my friend, “these beds will do; and
as for the rest, we are too near a kin to
lay together, though we may lodge near
one another.”</P>
<P>When bed-time came, he decently
went out of the room until I was in bed,
and then went in the bed on his own side
of the room, but lay talking to me for
some time.</P>
<P>At last repeating his usual saying, that
he could lie in the bed with me, and not
offer me the least injury, he starts up,
“And now, my dear,” says he, “you
shall see how just I will be to you, and
that I can keep my word;” and away he
comes to my bed.</P>
<P>I resisted a little, but I must confess I
should not have resisted him much, if he
had not made those promises; so after a
little struggle, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay still, and let him
come into my bed. When he was there
he took me in his arms, but he did not of∣fer
any thing, other than embracing me,
no not the whole night, but rose up and
dressed himself in the morning, and left
me as innocent for him, as I was the
day I was born.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="131"/>
This was a surprising thing to me,
and perhaps may be so to others, for he
was a brisk person; nor did he act thus
on a principle of religion, but of mere
affection; insisting on it, that though I
was to him the most agreeable woman
in the world, yet because he loved me
he could not injure me.</P>
<P>I own it was a noble principle, but
as it was what I never understood before,
it was to me the more amazing. We
travelled the rest of the journey as we
did before, and came back to the Bath,
where, as he had opportunity to come
to me when he would, he often repeated
the moderation, and, although all the
familiarities, between man and wife,
were common to us, yet he never once
offered to go any farther; and he valued
himself much upon it: yet, I do not
say that I was so pleased with it as he
thought I was.</P>
<P>We lived thus near two years, only
with this exception, that he went three
times to London, and once he continu∣ed
there four months; but, to do him
justice, he always supplied me with mo∣ney
very handsomely.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="132"/>
Had we continued thus, we had had
much to boast of; but as wise men say,
“It is ill venturing too near the brink
of a command,” so we found it; and
here again I must do him the justice
his own, that the first breach was not on
his part. It was one night, having drank,
I think, a little more wine, both of us,
than usual, though not in the least to
disorder either of us, when being clasp∣ed
close in his arms, I told him, I re∣peat
it with shame, that I could find in
my heart to discharge him of his engage∣ments
for one night.</P>
<P>He took me at my word immediately,
and after that, there was no resisting him,
neither indeed had I any mind to resist
him.</P>
<P>Thus the government of our virtue
was broken, and I exchanged the place
of friend, for that unmusical harsh-sounding
title of a mistress. The way
being thus cleared, and the bars of vir∣tue
and conscience thus removed, we
had the less difficulty afterwards to strug∣gle
with.</P>
<P>Frequently I looked on him with
blushes; and every now and then started
<PB N="125" REF="133"/>
that melancholy objection, “If I should
be with child, what will become of me?”
He encouraged me by telling me, since it
was gone such a length, if I was with
child, he would take care of that, and
of me too: this hardened us both. At
length, as I had feared, so it came to
pass, and I was indeed with child.</P>
<P>After I was sure it was so, we began
to think of taking measures for the ma∣naging
it, and I proposed trusting the
secret to my landlady, which he agreed
to. My landlady made light of it; she
said she knew it would come to that at
last, and made us merry about it: we
found her an experienced old lady at
such work; she undertook every thing,
engaged to procure a midwife and a
nurse, to satisfy all inquiries, and bring
us off with reputation.</P>
<P>When I grew near my time, as he had
furnished me very sufficiently with mo∣ney
for the extraordinary expences of
my lying-in, he left me and went to
London. I had every thing very hand∣some
about me, but did not affect to
be extravagant; besides, knowing that
such kind of affairs do not often last
<PB N="126" REF="134"/>
long, I took care to lay up as much
money as I could; making him believe
it was all spent upon the extraordinary
appearance of things in my lying-in.</P>
<P>I was brought to bed of a fine boy,
and when he heard of it he wrote me a
very kind letter about it, and he thought
it would look better for me to come away
for London as soon as I was up and well;
that he had provided apartments for me
at Hammersmith, as if I came thither
only from London; and that after a little
while I should go back to the Bath, and
he would go with me.</P>
<P>I embraced this offer, and according∣ly
hired a coach, and taking my child,
a wet-nurse, and a maid servant with me,
I went for London.</P>
<P>He met me at Reading in his own
chariot, and taking me into it, I left
the servants and the child in the hired
coach, and we all came to the londgings
at Hammersmith.</P>
<P>Now I was indeed in the height of
what I might call my prosperity, and
I wanted nothing but to be a wife, which,
however, could not be in this case, there
was no room for it; and, therefore, on
<PB N="127" REF="135"/>
all occasions I studied to save what I
could; knowing well enough, that men
who keep mistresses often change, grow
weary, and jealous of them, or some∣thing
or other happens to make them
withdraw their bounty; and sometimes
the ladies that are thus well used, are
not careful by a prudent conduct to
preserve the esteem of their persons,
or the nice article of their fidelity, and
then they are justly cast off with con∣tempt.</P>
<P>But I was secured in this point: for
as I had no inclination to change, so I
had no manner of acquaintance, and no
temptation to look any farther. I kept
no company but in the family where I
lodged, and with a clergyman's lady at the
next door; so that when he was absent
I visited nobody, nor did he ever find
me out of my chamber or parlour when∣ever
he came down; if I went any where
to take the air it was always with him.</P>
<P>The living in this manner with him,
and he with me, was certainly the most
undesigned thing in the world; he pro∣tested,
that when he became first ac∣quainted
with me, and even to the very
<PB N="128" REF="136"/>
night when we first broke in upon our
rules, he never had the least design; that
he always had a fincere affection for me,
but not the least real inclimation to do
what he had done. I assured him I ne∣ver
suspected him; that if I had, I
should not so easily have yielded to the
freedoms which brought it on, but that
it was all a surprise, and was owing to
the accident of our having yielded too
far to our mutual inclinations that night;
and indeed I have often observed since,
and leave it as a memento to the readers
of this story, that we ought to be cau∣tious
of gratifying our inclinations in
loose freedoms, lest we find our resolu∣tions
of virtue fail us, when their assis∣tance
should be most necessary.</P>
<P>It is true, from the first hour I be∣gan
to converse with him, I resolved to
oblige him if he offered it; but it was
because I wanted his assistance, and I
knew no other way of securing him;
but when we were that night together,
and had gone such a length, I found my
weakness; the inclination was not to be
resisted, and was obliged to yield up all
even before he asked it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="137"/>
However, he was so just that he ne∣ver
upbraided me with it; nor did he
ever express the least dislike of my con∣duct
on any other occasion, but always
protested he was as much delighted with
my company as he was the first hour we
came together.</P>
<P>It is true, he had no wife, that is,
she was no wife to him, and so I was in
no danger that way; but the just reflec∣tions
of conscience oftentimes snatch a
man, especially a man of sense, from
the arms of a mistress, as it did him at
last, though on another occasion.</P>
<P>On the other hand, though I was not
without secret reproaches of my own
conscience for the life I led, and that
even in the greatest height of the satis∣faction
I ever took, yet I had the terri∣ble
prospect of poverty which lay on me
as a frightful spectre, so that there was
no looking behind me: but as poverty
brought me into it, so fear of poverty
kept me in it, and I frequently resolved
to leave it quite off, if I could but come
to lay up enough to maintain me: but
these were thoughts of no weight, and
whenever he came to me they vanish∣ed;
<PB N="130" REF="138"/>
for his company was so delightful,
that there was no being melancholy
when he was there, the reflections were
all the subject of those hours when I was
alone.</P>
<P>I lived six years in this happy, or ra∣ther
unhappy condition, in which time I
brought him three children; and though
I removed twice, yet I came back the
sixth year to my first lodgings at Ham∣mersmith:
it was here that I was one
morning surprised with a kind, but me∣lancholy
letter from him, intimating,
that he was ill, and was afraid he should
have another fit of sickness, but his
wife's relations being in the house, it
would not be practicable to have me
with him, which, however, he express∣ed
his great dissatisfaction in, and that
he wished I could be allowed to nurse
him as I did before.</P>
<P>I was very much concerned at this ac∣count,
and was very impatient to know
how it was with him. I waited a fort∣night,
and heard nothing: which surpris∣ed
me, and I began to be very uneasy; I
think I may say, that for the next fortnight
I was near to distraction: it was my par∣ticular
<PB N="131" REF="139"/>
difficulty, that I did not know di∣rectly
where he was; for I understood at
first he was in the lodgings of his wife's
mother: but having removed myself to
London, I soon found by the help of
the direction I had for writing my letters
to him, how to enquire after him, and
there I found that he was at a house in
Bloomsbury-square, whither he had, a
little before he fell sick, removed his
whole family; and that his wife and his
wife's mother were in the same house,
though the wife was not suffered to know
that she was in the same house with her
husband.</P>
<P>Here I also understood that he was at
the last extremity, which made me almost
at the last extremity too, to have a true
account. One night I had the curiosity
to disguise myself like a servant maid,
and went to the door, as sent by a lady of
the neighbourhood, where he had lived be∣fore,
and giving my master and mistress's
compliments, I said, “I was sent to
know how Mr. Bates did, and how he
had rested that night.”</P>
<P>In delivering this message, I got the
opportunity I desired: for speaking with
<PB N="132" REF="140"/>
one of the maids, I held a long gossip's
tale with her, and had all the particu∣lars
of his illness, which I found was a
pleurisy attended with a cough and a
fever. She told me also who was in the
house, and how his wife was, who, by
her relation, they were in some hopes
might recover her understanding; but
as to the gentleman himself, she told me
the doctors said, there were very little
hopes of him; in the morning they
thought he had been dying, and he was
but little better then, for they did not
expect that he could live over the night.</P>
<P>This was heavy news for me: and I
began now to see an end of my prospe∣rity,
and to see also that it was very
well I had saved something, for that
now I had no view of my own living
before me.</P>
<P>It lay very heavy upon my mind too,
that I had a son, about five years old,
and no provision made for him, at least
that I knew off. With these considera∣tions,
and a sad heart, I went home,
and began to think how I should live,
and in what manner to bestow myself.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="141"/>
I could not rest without enquiring
again how he was; and not venturing to
go myself, I sent several messengers,
until after a fortnight's waiting longer,
I found there were hopes of his life,
though he was still very ill: then I a∣bated
my sending any more, and some
time after I learnt in the neighbourhood
that he was abroad again.</P>
<P>I then made no doubt, but I should
soon hear of him, and began to comfort
myself, being, as I thought, recovered.
With much surprise and amazement, I
waited near two months and heard no∣thing,
but that being recovered he was
gone into the country for the air; after
this it was yet two months more, and
then I understood he was returned to
London again, but still I heard nothing
from him.</P>
<P>I had sent several letters to him, and
directed them as usual, and found two
or three of them had been called for,
but not the rest. I wrote again in a
more pressing manner, and in one of
them, let him know, that I must be
forced to wait on him myself, repre∣senting
my circumstances, the rent of
<PB N="134" REF="142"/>
lodgings to pay, and the provision for
the child wanting, and my own deplo∣rable
condition, destitute of subsistence
after his solemn engagement to take care
of, and provide for me. I took a copy
of this letter, and finding it lay at the
house, near a month, and was not called
for, I found means to have the copy of
it put into his own hands at a Coffee-house,
where I had by enquiry found he
used to go.</P>
<P>This letter forced an answer from him;
by which, though I found I was to be
abandoned, yet I found he had sent a
letter to me some time before, desiring
me to go down to the Bath again; its
contents I shall come to presently.</P>
<P>It is true, that sick beds are the times
when such correspondences as this are
looked on with different countenance,
and seen with other eyes than we saw
them with, or than they appeared with
before. My lover had been at the gates
of death, and at the very brink of eter∣nity;
and it seems had been struck with
remorse, and with sad reflections upon
his past life; and among the rest, this
criminal correspondence with me, which
<PB N="135" REF="143"/>
was neither more or less than a long-continued
life of adultery, had represent∣ed
itself, as it really was, not as it had
been formerly thought by him to be; and
he looked upon it now with a just and a
religious abhorrence.</P>
<P>I cannot but observe also, and leave
it for the direction of my sex in such
cases, that whenever sincere repentance
succeeds such a crime as this, there
never fails to attend a hatred of the ob∣ject;
and the more the affection might
seem to be before, the hatred will be the
more in proportion. It will always be
so, it can be no otherwise; for there
cannot be a true and sincere abhorrence
of the offence, and the love to the cause
of it remain; there will with an abhor∣rence
of the sin, be found a detestation
of the fellow-sinner; you can expect no
other.</P>
<P>I found it so here: though good-man∣ners,
and justice, kept him from carry∣ing
it on to an extream; but the short
history of his part in this affair, was
thus; he perceived by my last letter,
and by all the rest, which he went for
after, that I was not gone to the Bath,
<PB N="136" REF="144"/>
that his first letter had not come to my
hand, upon which he wrote me the fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>“Madam,” “I
am surpised that my letter dated
the eighth of last month did not come
to your hand. I give you my word it
was delivered at your lodgings, and to
the hands of your maid.</P>
<P>I need not acquaint you with what has
been my condition for some time past;
and having been at the edge of the
grave, I am, by the unexpected and un∣deserved
mercy of Heaven, restored
again. In the condition I have been in,
it cannot be strange to you, that our
unhappy correspondence has not been
the least of the burthens which lay upon
my mind: I need say no more, those
things that must be repented of, must be
also reformed.</P>
<P>I wish you would think of going back
to the Bath. I enclose you here a bill for
one hundred pounds for clearing your∣self
at your lodgings, and carrying you
down, and hope it will be no surprise to
you to add, that on this account only,
<PB N="137" REF="145"/>
and not for any offence given me on
your side, I can see you no more. I will
take care of the child; leave him where
he is, or take him with you, as you
please. I wish you the like reflections,
and that they may be to your advantage.
I am, &amp;c.”</P>
<P>I was struck with this letter, such as
I cannot describe. The reproaches of my
own conscience were such as I cannot
express, for I was not blind to my
own crime: Yet, I never once reflected
that I was all this while a married wo∣man,
a wife to Mr. Smith the linnen-draper,
who though he had left me by
the necessity of his circumstances, had
no power to discharge me from the mar∣riage-contract
which was between us, or
to give the a legal liberty to marry
again; so that I had been no less than
an adultress all this while. I then re∣proached
myself with the liberties I had
taken, and how I had been a snare to
him, and that indeed, I was principal
in the crime: that now he was merci∣fully
snatched out of the gulph by a
convincing work upon his mind, but
<PB N="138" REF="146"/>
that I was left as if I was forsaken of
God's grace, and abandoned by Heaven
to a continuing in my wickedness.</P>
<P>Under these reflections I continued
very pensive for near a month, and did
not go down to the Bath, having no in∣clination
to be with the woman who I
was with before; and besides, I was
very loth she should know I was de∣serted.</P>
<P>And now I was greatly perplexed a∣bout
my little boy. It was death to me
to part with the child, and yet when
I considered the danger of being one
time or other left with him to keep with∣out
a maintenance to support him, I then
resolved to leave him where he was; but
then I concluded also to be near him
myself too, that I might have the satis∣faction
of seeing him, without the care
of providing for him.</P>
<P>I sent Mr. Bates a letter therefore,
that I had obeyed his orders in all things,
but that of going back to the Bath,
which I could not think of for many
reasons. That, however, parting from
him was a wound to me that I could ne∣ver
recover; yet I was fully satisfied his
<PB N="139" REF="147"/>
reflections were just, and would be very
far from desiring to obstruct his refor∣mation
or repentance.</P>
<P>Then I represented my own circum∣stances
to him in the most moving
terms. I told him that those unhappy
distresses which first moved him to a
generous and an honest friendship for
me, would, I hope, move him to a lit∣tle
concern for me now; though the
criminal part of our correspondence,
which I believed neither of us intended
to fall into at that time, was broken off;
that I desired to repent as sincerely as
he had done, but entreated him to put
me in some condition, that I might not
be exposed to temptations from the
frightful prospect of poverty and dis∣tress;
and if he had the least apprehen∣sions
of my being troublesome to him,
I begged he would put me in a condi∣tion
to go back to my mother in Virgi∣nia,
from whence he knew I came, and
that would put an end to all his fears on
that account. I concluded, that if he
would send me fifty pounds more to
facilitate my going away, I would pro∣mise
never to disturb him again; unless
<PB N="140" REF="148"/>
it was to hear of the well-doing of the
child, who, if I found my mother living,
and my circumstances able, I would
send for to come over to me, and take
him also effectually off of his hands.
Accordingly he was so genteel as to send
me the money; thus, though full sore
against my will, a final end was put to
this amour.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but reflect upon
the unhappy consequence of too great
freedoms between persons stated as we
were, upon the pretence of innocent in∣tentions,
and the love of friendship;
for the flesh has generally so great a
share in those friendships that it is great
odds but inclination prevails at last over
the most solemn resolutions, and that
vice breaks in at the breaches of decen∣cy,
which really innocent friendship
ought to preserve with the greatest strict∣ness:
but I leave the readers of these
things to their own just reflections,
which they will be more able to make
effectual, than I, who so soon forgot
myself.</P>
<P>I now had no help, no assistance, no
guide for my conduct. I knew what I
<PB N="141" REF="149"/>
aimed at, and what I wanted; but knew
not how to pursue the end by direct
means. I wanted to be placed in a set∣tled
state of living, and had I happened
to have met with a sober good husband,
I should have been as faithful a wife to
him as virtue itself could have formed.
If I have been otherwise, the vice came
in always at the door of necessity, not
at the door of inclination; and I under∣stood
too well, by the want of it, what
the value of a settled life was, to do
any thing to forfeit the felicity of it;
nay, I should have made the better wife
for all the difficulties I had passed thro',
nor did I in any of the times that I
had been a wife, give my husbands the
least uneasiness on account of my be∣haviour.</P>
<P>At length, a new scene opened. There
was in the house, where I lodged, a
North-country gentlewoman, and nothing
was more frequent in her discourse, than
her account of the cheapness of provi∣sions,
and the easy way of living in her
country; how plentiful every thing was,
and what good company they kept; 'till
<PB N="142" REF="150"/>
at last I told her she almost tempted me
to go and live in her country; for I
that was a widow, though I had suffi∣cient
to live on, yet had no way of en∣creasing
it, and that London was an ex∣pensive
and extravagant place.</P>
<P>I should here observe, that not only
she, but others, imagined I was a great
fortune, or at least, that I had three or
four thousand pounds, if not more, and
all in my own hands: this woman, I
say, was mighty free with me, when she
thought me inclined to go into her
country; she said, she had a sister lived
near Leverpoole, that her brother was a
considerable gentleman there, and had a
great estate also in Ireland; that she
would go down there in about two
months, and if I would give her my
company thither, I should be as wel∣come
as herself for a month, or more,
as I pleased, 'till I should see how I liked
the country; and if I thought fit to
live there, she would undertake they
would take care, though they did not
entertain lodgers themselves, they would
recommend me to some agreeable family
<PB N="143" REF="151"/>
where I should be placed to my con∣tent.</P>
<P>If this woman had known my real
circumstances, she would never have
laid so many snares, and taken so many
weary steps to catch a desolate creature
that was good for little when it was
caught: and indeed, I, whose case was
almost desperate, and thought I could
not be much worse, was not very anxious
about what might befall me, provided
they did me no personal injury; so I
suffered myself, though not without a
deal of invitation, and great professions
of sincere friendship and real kindness,
to be prevailed upon to go with her;
and accordingly I packed up my things,
and put myself in a readiness, though I
did not absolutely know whither I was
to go.</P>
<P>And now I found myself in great dis∣tress;
for I had not one friend in the
world with whom to trust that little I
had, or to direct me how to dispose of
it, and this perplexed me. I thought
of the Bank, but I had no friend to
commit the management of it to, and
to keep and carry about with me bank
<PB N="144" REF="152"/>
bills, I looked upon it as unsafe; that if
they were lost, my money was lost, and
then I was undone; and on the other
hand I might be robbed and perhaps
murdered in a strange place for them;
this perplexed me strangely, and what to
do I knew not.</P>
<P>It came in my thoughts one morn∣ing
that I would go to the Bank myself,
where I had often been to receive the in∣terest
of some bills I had, which had in∣terest
payable on them, and where I
had found the clerk to whom I applied
myself very honest, and particularly so
fair one time, that when I had miss-told
my money, and taken less than my due,
and was coming away, he set me to
rights and gave me the rest.</P>
<P>I went to him, and represented my
case, and asked, if he would trouble
himself to be my adviser, who was a
friendless widow, and knew not what to
do. He told me, if I desired his opi∣nion
of any thing within the reach of
his business, he would do his endeavour
that I should not be wronged; that he
would help me to a sober person, a man
of his acquaintance, who was a clerk in
<PB N="145" REF="153"/>
such business too, though not in their
house, whose judgment was good, and
whose honesty I might depend upon,
“for,” added he, “I will answer for
him, and for every step he takes.”</P>
<P>After some pause, I told him, I had
rather have depended upon himself, be∣cause
I had found him honest, but if
that could not be, I would take his re∣commendation
sooner than any one's else;
“I dare say, madam, that you will be as
well satissied with my friend as with me,
and he is thoroughly able to assist you,
which I am not;” he added, that his
friend should take nothing of me for
his advice or assistance; and this encou∣raged
me much.</P>
<P>He appointed the same evening for
me to meet him and his friend; and in∣deed
as soon as I saw him, and he began
to talk of the affair, I was fully satis∣fied
that I had a very honest man to deal
with: his countenance spoke it; and his
character, as I heard afterwards, was
every where so good, that I had no room
for any doubts upon me.</P>
<P>He told me I might lodge the money
in the bank as an account, and its being
<PB N="146" REF="154"/>
entered in the books would entitle me to
the money at any time: and if I was in
the North I might draw bills on the
cashire and receive it when I would;
but that then it would be esteemed as
running cash, and the bank would give
no interest for it; that I might buy
stock with it, and so it would lie in store
for me; but that then if I wanted to
dispose of it, I must come up to town
to transfer it, and even it would be with
some difficulty I should receive the half-yearly
dividend, unless I was here in
person, or had some friend I could trust
with having the stock in his name to
do it for me, and that would have the
same difficulty in it as before; and with
that he looked hard at me and smiled;
at last, says he, “Why do you not get
a steward, madam, that may take you
and your money together, and then you
will have the trouble taken off of your
hands?”</P>
<P>“Ay, sir, and the money too it may
be, for truly I find the hazard that way
is as much as it is the other way;” but
I remember, I said, secretly to myself,
“I wish you will ask me the question, I
<PB N="147" REF="155"/>
would consider very seriously on it be∣fore
I said no.”</P>
<P>He went on a good way with me, and
I thought once or twice he was in earn∣est,
but I found at last he had a wife;
but when he owned he had, he shook
his head, and said, with some concern,
that indeed, he had a wife, and no
wife. I began to think he had been in
the condition of my late lover. How∣ever,
we had not much more discourse
at that time, but he told me he was
in too much hurry of business then;
that if I would come to his house after
their business was over, he would con∣sider
what might be done for me. I
told him I would come, and desired to
know where he lived. He gave me a
direction in writing; and when he gave
it me, he said, “there it is, madam, if
you dare trust yourself with me,”</P>
<P>“Yes, sir, I believe I may venture
to trust you, for you have a wife you
say, and I don't want a husband; be∣sides,
I dare trust you with my money,
and if that were gone, I may trust my∣self
any where.”</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="156"/>
He said some things in jest that were
very handsome, and would have pleased
me very well if they had been in earn∣est;
but that passed over. I took the
directions, and appointed to attend him
at his house at seven a clock the same
evening.</P>
<P>When I came he made several propo∣sals
for my placing my money in the
Bank, in order to my having interest for
it; but still some difficulty or other
came in the way, which he objected as
not safe; and I found such a sincere
disinterested honesty in him, I began to
think, I had certainly found the honest
man I wanted, and that I could never
put myself into better hands; so I told
him, with a great deal of freedom, that
I had never met with man or woman
yet that I could trust, or in whom I
could think myself safe; but I saw he
was so disinterestedly concerned for my
welfare, that I said I would freely trust
him with the management of that little
I had, if he would accept to be steward
for a widow that could give him no
salary.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="157"/>
He smiled, and getting up, with great
respect, saluted me. He said he took it
very kindly I had so good an opinion of
him; that he would not deceive me,
and he would do any thing in his power
to serve me; but he could not by any
means accept of a trust that might
bring him to be suspected of self-in∣terest,
and if I should die he might have
disputes with my executors, which he
should be very loth to encumber himself
with.</P>
<P>I replied, if those were all his objec∣tions
I would soon remove them, and
convince him, there was not the least
room for any difficulty; for as for sus∣pecting
him, if ever I should do it,
now was the time, and not put the
trust into his hands; and whenever I did
suspect him he could but throw it up
then and refuse to go any farther. As to
executors, I assured him I had no heirs,
nor any relations in England, and I
would have neither heirs or executors
but himself, unless I should alter my
condition, and then his trust and trou∣ble
should cease together; but I told
him if I died as I was, it should be all
<PB N="150" REF="158"/>
his own, and he would deserve it by
being so faithful as I was satisfied he
would be.</P>
<P>He changed his countenance and ask'd
me, how I came to have so much good
will for him? and looking pleased, said,
he might lawfully wish he was a single
man for my sake. I smiled and told
him, that as he was not, my offer could
have no design upon him in it; and to
wish, as he did, was not to be allowed,
it was criminal to his wife.</P>
<P>He replied, I was wrong; for, “ma∣dam,
as I said before, I have a wife
and no wife.”</P>
<P>“I know nothing of your circum∣stances
that way, sir, but it cannot be
innocent to wish your wife dead.”</P>
<P>“I tell you,” says he again, “she is
a wife and no wife; you don't know
what I am, or what she is.”</P>
<P>“That's true, sir, I do not know
what you are; but I believe you to be
an honest man, and that's the cause of
my confidence in you.”</P>
<P>“Well, well,” says he, “and so I
am, I hope, but I am something else
<PB N="151" REF="159"/>
too, madam; for, to be plain with you,
she is no better than she should be.”</P>
<P>I waved the discourse, and began to
talk of my business; but I found he
could not have done with it, so I let
him alone, and he went on to tell me
his case, particularly, that having been
out of England some time before he
came to the post he was in, she had had
two children by an officer of the army;
that when he came to England, and
upon her submission, took her again,
yet she went away from him with a
linnen-draper's apprentice, robbed him
of what she could come at, and conti∣nued
to live from him still; “so that,
madam, she is lewd not by necessity,
but by inclination, and for the sake of
the vice.”</P>
<P>I told him, I pitied him, and wished
him well rid of her, and still would
have talked of my business; but it would
not do. At last he looks steadily at me,
“Look you, madam, you came to ask
advice of me; but I must turn the
tables, since you are so friendly, and I
must ask advice of you; tell me what
<PB N="152" REF="160"/>
can I do to do myself justice upon
her?”</P>
<P>“Alas, sir, 'tis a case too nice for me
to advise in, but it seems she has run
away from you, so you are rid of her;
what can you desire more? She may
indeed run you into debt, but the law
has furnished you with methods to pre∣vent
it.”</P>
<P>“No, no, that is not the case, it
is not that part that I speak of. I
would be rid of her so that I might mar∣ry
again.”</P>
<P>“Well, sir, then you must divorce
her.”</P>
<P>“That, madam, is very tedious and
expensive.”</P>
<P>“Why, sir, if you can get any wo∣man
you like to take your word, I sup∣pose
your wife would not dispute the li∣berty
with you that she takes herself.”</P>
<P>“Ay, but it would be hard to bring
an honest woman to do that; and for
the other sort, I have had enough of
her to meddle with any more.”</P>
<P>I replied, “Why you shut the door
against any honest woman accepting
you, for you condemn all that should
<PB N="153" REF="161"/>
venture upon you at once, and con∣clude,
that really a woman that takes
you now, cannot be honest.”</P>
<P>“I wish you would satisfy me that
an honest woman would take me, I
would venture it. Will you take me ma∣dam?”</P>
<P>“That is not a fair question, sir, af∣ter
what you have said; however, lest
you should think I wait only for a re∣cantation
of it, I shall answer you plain∣ly,
No; my business is of another kind,
and I did not expect you would have
turned my serious application into a
comic one.”</P>
<P>“Why, madam, my case is as serious
as your's can be, and I stand in as much
need of advice as you do; for I know
not what course to take, I protest to
you.”</P>
<P>“Why, sir, it is easy to give advice in
your case, much easier than it is in mine.”</P>
<P>“Speak then, madam, I beg of you,
for now you encourage me.”</P>
<P>“Why, sir, if your case is so plain
as you say it is, you may be legally di∣vorced,
and then you may find honest
women enough to ask the question;
<PB N="154" REF="162"/>
the sex is not so scarce that you can want
a wife.”</P>
<P>“Well then, I am in earnest, I will
take your advice; but shall I ask you one
question seriously.”</P>
<P>“Any question, sir, but that you did
before.”</P>
<P>“No, madam, that answer will not
do, for that is the question I shall ask.”</P>
<P>“You may ask what questions you
please, but you have my answer already;
besides, sir, can you think so ill of me,
as that I would give any answer to such
a question before-hand? Can any wo∣man
believe you in earnest, or think you
design any thing but to banter her?”</P>
<P>“I assure you, madam, I do not
banter you, I am in earnest, pray con∣sider
of it.”</P>
<P>“But, sir, I came to you about my
own business; I beg of you let me know,
what you will advise me to do?”</P>
<P>“I will be prepared, madam, against
you come again.”</P>
<P>“Nay, sir, you have forbid my com∣ing
any more.”</P>
<P>“Why so?” and he looked a little sur∣prized.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="163"/>
“Because, sir, you cannot expect I
should visit you on the account you talk
of.”</P>
<P>“Well, madam, you shall promise
me to come again, and I will not say
any more of it until it is done; but I
desire you will prepare to be better con∣ditioned,
for you shall be the woman;
why I owe it to your unlooked-for kind∣ness,
if it were to nothing else; but
I have other reasons too.”</P>
<P>I said very respectfully, it was
time enough to consider of these things
when he was in a condition to talk of
them; in the mean time, I told him, I
was going a great way from him, and
he would find objects enough to please
him better. We broke off here for the
present, and he made me promise him
to come egain the next day, for his reso∣lutions
upon my own business; which
after some pressing, I did.</P>
<P>We had now a second conference
upon the subject. He protested his af∣fection
to me, and indeed, I had no
room to doubt it; he declared that it
began the first moment I talked with
him. He then told me, how much the
<PB N="156" REF="164"/>
offer I had made of trusting him with
my effects, and leaving them to him,
had engaged him. He then said he had
a proposal to make, which I should pro∣mise
him I would not take ill, if I
should not grant it. I told him I hoped
he would make no dishonourable pro∣posal,
especially in his own house; and
that if it was such, I desired he would
not propose it, that I might not be
obliged to offer any resentment that
did not become the respect I professed,
and the trust I had placed in him in
coming to his house; and begged he
would give me leave to go: and I began
to put on my gloves, and prepare to be
gone.</P>
<P>Still he importuned me not to talk of
going: he assured me he had no disho∣nourable
thing in his thoughts about
me, and was very far from offering any
thing to me that was dishonourable; and
if I thought so, he would choose to say
no more of it.</P>
<P>I told him, I was ready to hear any
thing that he had to say, depending that
he would say nothing unworthy of him∣self,
or unfit for me to hear. Upon this,
<PB N="157" REF="165"/>
he told me his proposal was, that I
would marry him, though he had not
yet obtained the divorce from his wife;
and to satisfy me that he meant honour∣ably,
he would promise not to desire me
to live with him, or to bed with him,
until the divorce was obtained.</P>
<P>I declined the motion with some
warmth, and said, that such a pro∣posal
would be of no signification, but
to entangle us both in great difficulties;
for if he should not at last obtain the
divorce, we could not dissolve the mar∣riage,
neither could we proceed in it;
so that if he was disappointed, I left
him to consider what a condition we
should both be in.</P>
<P>In short, I carried on the argument
against this so far, that I convinced him, it
was not a proposal that had any meaning
in it. Then he went from it to another,
and that was, that I would sign a con∣tract
with him, conditioning to marry
him as soon as the divorce was ob∣tained,
and to be void if he could not
obtain it.</P>
<P>I told him that was more rational
than the other; but as this was the first
<PB N="158" REF="166"/>
time that ever I could imagine him weak
enough to be in earnest, I did not use
to say Yes at first asking; I would consi∣der
of it.</P>
<P>In a word I avoided a contract; and
told him I was going into the North,
that he should know where to write to
me in consequence of the business I
had intrusted him with; that I would
give him a sufficient pledge of my re∣spect
for him, for I would leave almost
all I had in the world in his hands; and
I would thus far give him my word,
that as soon as he had sued out a di∣vorce,
if he would send me an account
of it I would some up to London; that
then we would talk seriously of the mat∣ter:
and I took my leave of him.</P>
<P>In a few days after, I went with my
friend, as I called her, into Lancashire.
All the way she caressed me with the ut∣most
appearance of a sincere undissem∣bled
affection; her brother brought a
gentleman's coach to Warrington, to re∣ceive
us, and we were carried from
thence to Leverpoole with as much cere∣mony
as I could desire: we were also
entertained at a merchant's house in
<PB N="159" REF="167"/>
Leverpoole three or four days very hand∣somely.
Then she told me she would
carry me to an uncle's house of her's,
where we should be nobly entertained.
She did so: her uncle, as she called him,
sent a coach and four horses for us, and
we were carried near forty miles, I know
not whither.</P>
<P>We came, however, to a gentleman's
seat, where was a numerous family, a
large park, extraordinary company in∣deed,
and where she was c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled cousin.
I told her if she had resolved to bring
me into such company, she should have
let me have prepared myself, and have
surnished myself with cloaths. The la∣dies
took notice of that, and told me
very genteely, they did not value peo∣ple
in their country so much by their
cloaths, as they did in London; that
their cousin had fully informed them of
my quality, and that I did not want
cloaths to set me off; in short, they en∣tertained
me not like what I was, but
like what they thought I had been,
namely, a widow lady of a great for∣tune.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="168"/>
I stay'd here six weeks; and then my
conductor led me back to a country
village, about six miles from Lever∣poole,
where her brother, as she called
him, came to visit me in his own cha∣riot,
and the next morning he made love
to me.</P>
<P>However, in all appearance this bro∣ther
was a match worth my listening to,
and the least his estate was valued at,
was a thousand pounds a year; but the
sister said it was worth fifteen hundred
pounds a year, and lay most of it in lre∣land.</P>
<P>I that was a great fortune, or passed
for such, was above being asked how
much my estate was; and my false
friend, taking it upon a foolish hearsay,
had raised it from five hundred pounds
to five thousand, and by the time
she came into the country, she called
it fifteen thousand. The Irishman, her
brother, for such I understood him to
be, was stark mad at this bait. He had,
to give him his due, the appearance of
the fine gentleman: he was tall, well
shaped, and had an extraordinary ad∣dress;
talked as naturally of his park,
<PB N="161" REF="169"/>
his stables, horses, his game-keepers,
woods, and his tenants, as if he had
been in the mansion-house, and I had
seen them all about me.</P>
<P>He never so much as asked me about
my fortune, or estate; but assured me
that when he came to Dublin he would
jointure me in six hundred pounds a
year good land; and that he would en∣ter
into a deed of settlement here, for
the performance of it.</P>
<P>This was such language as I had not
been used to, and my female friend,
was for ever telling me how great her
brother lived. One time she would come
for my orders, how I would have my
coach painted, and how lined; and ano∣ther
time what cloaths I would chuse:
In short, my eyes were dazzled, I had
now lost my power of saying no, and
to cut the story short, I consented to be
married.</P>
<P>I cannot say, but I had some reflec∣tions
upon the dishonourable forsaking
my faithful citizen, who loved me sin∣cerely,
and who was endeavouring to
quit himself of a scandalous woman, by
whom he had been indeed barbarously
<PB N="162" REF="170"/>
used, and promised himself infinite hap∣piness
in his new choice; which choice
was now giving up herself to another in
a manner almost as scandalous as hers
could be.</P>
<P>But the glittering shew of a great
estate, represented every hour to my
imagination, hurried me away, and gave
me no time to think of London, or of
any thing there.</P>
<P>But the thing was done. I was now in
the arms of my new spouse, who ap∣peared
still the same as before, great
even to magnificence; and nothing less
than a thousand pound, a year could sup∣port
the equipage he appeared in.</P>
<P>After we had been married about a
month, he began to talk of my going
to West-Chester in order to embark for
Ireland. However, he did not hurry
me, for we staid near three weeks longer,
and then he sent to Chester for a coach
to meet us at the Black Rock, as they
call it, over against Leverpoole. Thi∣ther
we went in a fine pinnace, with six
oars, his servants, and horses, and bag∣gage
going in the ferry-boat. He made
his excuse to me, that he had no ac∣quaintance
<PB N="163" REF="171"/>
at Chester, but he would go
before and get some handsome apart∣ments
for me at a private house. I ask'd
him how long we should stay at Chester?
he said, not at all, any longer than one
night or two, but he would immediately
hire a coach to go to Holyhead. Then I
told him he should by no means give
himself the trouble to get private lodg∣ings
for one night or two, for that
Chester being a great place, I made no
doubt but there would be very good inns,
and accommodation enough; so we
lodged at an inn in the West Street, not
far from the cathedral.</P>
<P>Here he talking of my going to Ire∣land,
asked me, if I had any affairs
to settle at London before we went
off? I told him, not of any great con∣sequence,
but what might be done as
well by letter from Dublin. “Madam,”
says he, very respectfully, “I suppose the
greatest part of your estate, which my
sister tells me is most of it in money in
the bank of England, lies secure enough;
but in case it requires transferring, or any
way altering its property, it will be
<PB N="164" REF="172"/>
necessary to go up to London, and settle
those things before we go over.”</P>
<P>I looked strange at it, and told him,
I knew not what he meant; that I had
no effects in the bank of England that
I knew of; and I hoped he could not
say, that I had ever told him I had.
No, he said, I had not told him so, but
his sister had said the greatest part of
my estate lay there; “and I only men∣tioned
it my dear, that if there was any
occasion to settle it, or order any thing
about it, we might not be obliged to the
hazard and trouble of another voyage
back again,” for he added, that he did
not care to venture me too much upon
the sea.</P>
<P>I was surprised at this, and began to
consider seriously, what the meaning of
it must be; and it presently occurred to
me, that my friend, who called him
brother, had represented me in colours
which were not my due; and I thought,
since it was come to that pitch, that I
would know the bottom of it before I
went out of England, and before I
should put myself into I knew not whose
hands in a strange country.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="173"/>
Upon this I called his sister into my
chamber, and letting her know the dis∣course
her brother and I had heen upon
the evening before, I desired her to tell
me, what she had said to him, and upon
what footing it was that she had made
this marriage? She owned, that she had
informed him, that I was a great for∣tune;
and said, that she was told so at
London.</P>
<P>“Told so,” says I, warmly, “did I
ever tell you so?”</P>
<P>No, she said, it was true I did not
tell her so; but I had said several times,
that what I had was in my own disposal.</P>
<P>“I did so,” replied I very hastily,
“but I never told you, I had any thing
called a fortune; no, not that I had
one hundred pounds, or the value of an
hundred pounds in the world; and how
did it consist with my being a fortune,
that I should come here into the north
of England with you, only upon the ac∣count
of living cheap?”</P>
<P>At these words, which I spoke warm
and sighed, my husband, her brother as
she called him, came into the room; and
I desired him to come and sit down, for
<PB N="166" REF="174"/>
I had something of moment to say be∣fore
them both, which it was absolutely
necessary he should hear.</P>
<P>He looked a little disturbed at the
earnestness with which I seemed to speak
it, and came and sat down by me, hav∣ing
first shut the door; upon which I be∣gan,
for I was very much provoked, and
turning myself to him, “I am afraid,”
says I, “my dear,” for I spoke with kind∣ness
on his side, “that you have a very
great abuse put upon you, and an in∣jury
done you never to be repaired, in
your marrying me, which, however, as
I have had no hand in it, I desire I may
be fairly acquitted of it; and that the
blame may lie where it ought to lie, and
no where else, for I wash my hands of
every part of it.”</P>
<P>“What injury can be done me, my
dear,” says he, “in marrying you? I
hope it is to my honour and advantage
every way.”</P>
<P>“I will soon explain it to you,” says
I, “and I fear you will have no reason
to think yourself well used; but I will
convince you, my dear, that I have had
no hand it:” and there I stopped.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="175"/>
He looked now scared and wild, and
began, I believed, to suspect what fol∣lowed;
however, looking towards me,
saying only, “Go on,” he sat silent, as if
to hear what I had more to say.</P>
<P>“I asked you last night,” if ever I
made any boast to you of my estate in
the bank of England, or any where
else, and you owned I had not; and I
desire you will tell me here, before your
sister, if ever I gave you any reason to
think so, or that ever we had any dis∣course
about it: “and he owned again, I
had not;” but said, I had appeared as
a woman of fortune, and he depended
on it that I was so, and hoped he was not
deceived.</P>
<P>“I am not enquiring whether you
have been deceived or not;” I fear you
have, and I too; but I am clearing
myself from the unjust charge of
being concerned in deceiving you.
I have been now asking your sister
if ever I told her of any fortune or
estate I had, or gave her any particulars
of it; and she owns, I never did:
“And pray, madam” turning myself
to her, “be so just to be, before your
<PB N="168" REF="176"/>
brother, to charge me, if you can, if
ever I pretended to you that I had an
estate; and why, if I had, should I
come down into this country with you
on purpose to spare that little I had, and
live cheap?”</P>
<P>She could not deny one word, but
said she had been told in London that I
had a very great fortune, and that it lay
in the bank of England.</P>
<P>“And now, dear sir,” said I, turning
myself to him, “be so just as to tell me
who has abused both you and me so
much, as to make you believe I was a
fortune, and prompt you to court me to
this marriage?”</P>
<P>He could not speak a word, but
pointed to her; and after some pause,
flew into the most furious passion that
ever I saw a man in my life; cursing
her, and calling her all the names he
could think of; and that she had ruined
him, declaring, that she had told him I
had fifteen thousand pounds, and that
she was to have five hundred pounds of
him for procuring this match. He then
added, that she was none of his sister,
but had been his mistress for two years
<PB N="169" REF="177"/>
before, that she had had one hundred
pounds in part of this bargain, and
that he was utterly undone if things
were as I said; and in his raving, he
swore, he would let her heart's blood
out immediately, which frighted her and
me too; she cried, said she had been
told so in the house where I lodged;
but this aggravated him more than be∣fore
that she should put so far upon
him, and run things such a length upon
no other authority than hearsay; and
said very honestly, he was afraid we
were both undone; “for to be plain, my
dear, I have no estate, what little I had,
this devil has made me run out in wait∣ing
on you, and putting me into this
equipage.” She took the opportunity of
his talking with me, got out of the
room, and I never saw her more.</P>
<P>I was confounded now as much as he,
and knew not what to say: I thought
many ways that I had the worst of it,
but his saying, he was undone, and that he
had no estate neither, put me into a meer
distraction. “Why,” says I, “this has
been a juggle, for we are married here
upon a double fraud; you are undone by
<PB N="170" REF="178"/>
the disappointment, and I if had had a
a fortune I had been cheated too.”</P>
<P>“You would indeed have been cheated,
my dear,” says he, “but you would not
have been undone; for fifteen thousand
pounds would have maintained us both
very handsomely in this country; and I
assure you,” added he, “I had resolved to
have dedicated all of it to you, I would
not have wronged you of a shilling;” and
the rest I would have made up in my
affection, and tenderness of you as long
as I lived.</P>
<P>This was very honest, and I really
believed he spoke as he intended, and
he was a man that was as well qualified
to make me happy, as to his temper and
behaviour, as any man ever was; but
his having no estate, and being run into
debt on this ridiculous account in the
country, made all the prospect dismal
and dreadful, and I knew not what to
say, or what to think.</P>
<P>I told him it was very unhappy, that
so much love, and so much good-na∣ture,
as I discovered in him, should be
thus precipitated into misery; that I
<PB N="171" REF="179"/>
saw nothing before us but ruin: for as
to me, it was my unhappiness, that
what little I had was not able to relieve
us long, and with that I pulled out a
bank bill of thirty pounds and eleven
guineas, which I told him I had saved
out of my little income; and by the ac∣count
she had given me of the way
of living in that country, I expected
it would maintain me two or three
years; that if it was taken from me I
was left destitute, and he knew what the
condition of a woman among strangers
must be, if she had no money; how∣ever,
I told him if he would take it,
there it was.</P>
<P>He replied with great concern, and I
thought I saw tears stand in his eyes,
he would not touch it; that he abhorred
the thoughts of stripping me, and
making me miserable; that on the con∣trary,
he had fifty guineas left, which
was all he had in the world; and he
pulled them out and threw them on the
table, bidding me take them, though he
were to starve for the want of them.</P>
<P>I returned, with the same concern for
him, that I could not bear to hear him
<PB N="172" REF="180"/>
talk so; on the contrary, if he could
propose any probable method of living.
I would do any thing that became me on
my part, and that I would live as close
and as narrow as he could desire.</P>
<P>He begged of me to talk no more at
that rate, for it would make him dis∣tracted;
he said he was bred a gentle∣man,
though he was reduced to a low
fortune; and there was but one way
left which he could think of, and that
would not do, unless I could answer him
one question, which, however, he said,
he would not press me to. I told him I
would answer it honestly, whether it
would be to his satisfaction or not.</P>
<P>“Why then, my dear, tell me plain∣le,
will the little you have keep us toge∣ther
in any figure, or will it not?”</P>
<P>I told him I never willingly deceived
him, and I never would: I was very
sorry to say that the little I had would
not subsist us; that it was not sufficient
to subsist me alone in the South coun∣try;
and that this was the reason that
made me put myself into the hands of
that wretch she having assured me that
I might board very handsomely at a
<PB N="173" REF="181"/>
town, where I had not yet been, for
about eight pounds a year, and my
whole income not being above fifteen
pounds a year, I thought I might live
easy upon it, and wait for better things.</P>
<P>He shook his head and remained si∣lent,
and a very melancholy evening we
had. However, when we had almost
supped, he looked a little better and
more chearful, and called for a bottle
of wine; “Come, my dear, tho' the
case is bad it is to no purpose to be de∣jected:
be as easy as you can,” I will en∣deavour
to find out some way to live;
if you can but subsist yourself, I must
try the world again; a man ought to
think like a man: To be discouraged,
is to yield to the misfortune: with this
he filled a glass, and drank to me, hold∣ing
my hand, and pressing it hard in
his, and protesting afterward his main
concern was for me.</P>
<P>It was really a truly gallant spirit he
was of, and it was the more grievous to
me: 'Tis something of relief even to be
undone by a man of honour; but here
the greatest disappointment was on his
side, for he had really spent a great deal
<PB N="174" REF="182"/>
of money, deluded by this procuress.
The design of deluding a woman of for∣tune,
if I had been so, was base; the
putting the face of great things upon
poor circumstances was a fraud; but
the case a little differed too, and that in
his favour, for he was not a rake that
made a trade to delude women, and as
some have done get six or seven fortunes
after one another, and then rifle and
leave them; but he was really a gentle∣man,
unfortunate and low, but had
lived well; and though if I had had a
fortune I should have been enraged at
the slut for betraying me; yet, really
for the man, a fortune would not have
been ill bestowed on him, for he was a
lovely person, of generous principles,
good sense, and of abundance of good-humour.</P>
<P>We had a deal of conversation that
night, for we neither of us slept much;
he was as penitent, for having put those
cheats upon me as if it had been fe∣lony;
he offered me again every shilling
of the money he had about him, and
said, he would go into the army and seek
the world for more.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="183"/>
I asked him, how he could be so un∣kind
to propose to carry me into Ire∣land,
when he knew he could not
maintain me when he had got me there?</P>
<P>He took me in his arms, “My dear,
I do assure you, upon my honour, if
you will allow me the expression, I
never intended to go to Ireland, much
less to have carried you there; but
came hither to be concealed from those,
who had heard what I pretended to,
and, that nobody might ask me for
money before I was furnished to supply
them.”</P>
<P>I replied, “But where then, Mr. Car∣rol,
were we to have gone next?”</P>
<P>“Why, my dear, I will confess the
whole scheme as I had laid it. I pur∣posed
here to ask you something about
your estate, and when you had entered
into some account with me of the par∣ticular,
I would have made an excuse,
to have put off our voyage to Ireland
for some time, and to have gone first to∣wards
London. Then, my dear, I re∣solved
to have confessed all the circum∣stances
of my own affairs, and let you
<PB N="176" REF="184"/>
know I had indeed made use of these
artifices to obtain your consent to marry
me, but had now nothing to do but to
ask your pardon, and to tell you how
abundantly, I would endeavour to make
you forget what was past, by the felicity
of the days to come.”</P>
<P>“Indeed, Mr. Carrol, I find you
would soon have conquered me; and it
is my affliction, that I am not in a con∣dition
to let you see how easily I should
have been reconciled, and have passed
by all you have put upon me, in recom∣pence
of so much good-humour▪ but▪
my dear, what can we do now? We
are both undone, and what better are we
for our being reconciled, seeing we have
nothing to live on?”</P>
<P>He begged me at last to talk no
more of it, for he said, I should break
his heart; so we talked of other things
a little, until at last he took a hus∣band's
leave of me, and we both fell a
sleep.</P>
<P>In the morning on the table, I found
the following letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="177" REF="185"/>
<OPENER>“My dear,”</OPENER>
<P>“Having been drawn in, by an in∣famous
woman, to do an action con∣trary
to the general practice of my life,
highly to your prejudice, I implore
your forgiveness with the greatest since∣rity.
Conscious of my being unable to
support you, and grieved in knowing I
am the author of your ruin, I am de∣termined
never to trouble you more,
unless fortune should so favour me as to
bring you relief; then it shall be yours,
and all yours, wherever I may be so
happy as to find you. Until that blessed
time arrive, shall be the constant prayer
of your affectionate, though as present
unfortunate husband,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>JAMES CARROL.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Nothing that ever befel me, sunk
so deep into my heart as this; and what
added to it, upon searching in my pock∣et,
I there found he had put in ten
guineas, his gold watch, and two dia∣mond
rings.</P>
<P>I kept my seat for hours together,
until my maid interrupted me, by tel∣ling
<PB N="178" REF="186"/>
me my dinner was ready; then I
fell into a vehement fit of crying. Thus
I past the afternoon, until about seven
o'clock; when, to my unspeakable sur∣prise,
he came into my chamber.</P>
<P>He no sooner entered the room, but
he ran to me and took me in his
arms, holding me fast and almost stop∣ping
my breath with his kisses, but spoke
not a word. At length I began, “My
dear, how could you go and leave me?”
To which he gave no answer.</P>
<P>When our ecstasies were a little over,
he told me he went about fifteen miles,
but it was not in his power to go any
farther, without coming back to see me
again, and to take his leave of me, he
said, for ever.</P>
<P>Enfolding him close in my arms,
“You shall leave me no more,” said I;
“I will go over the world with you
rather.”</P>
<P>He replied, it was difficult for him
to leave me, but since it must be, he
hoped I would make it as easy to my∣self
as I could; but as for him, it would
be his destruction.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="187"/>
However, he considered he had left
me to travel to London alone, which
was too long a journey; and as he
might as well go that way, as any way
else, he resolved to see me safe thither,
or near it; and if he did go away
then without taking his leave, I should
not take it ill of him: and this he made
me promise.</P>
<P>He told me also he had dismissed his
servants, sold their horses, and sent the fel∣lows
away to seek their fortunes: “and,”
said he, “it cost me some tears by myself,
to think how much happier they were than
their master, for they could go to the
next gentleman's house to seek for a ser∣vice,
whereas I knew not whither to
go, or what to do.</P>
<P>I said, I was so compleatly misera∣ble
in his leaving me, that I could not
be worse; and in the mean time I agreed
that we would go together to London;
but could not be brought to consent he
should go away, and not take his leave
of me as he proposed. Then I pulled
out his watch, his rings, and his ten
guineas; but he would not take them,
<PB N="180" REF="188"/>
which made me suspect that he resolved
to go off upon the road, and leave me.</P>
<P>The truth is, the circumstances he
was in, the expressions of his letter, the
kind treatment I had from him in the
affair, with the concern he shewed for
me in it; his manner of parting with
that large share which he gave me of
his little stock left; all these had joined
to make such impressions on me, that
I really loved him tenderly, and could
not bear the thought of parting with
him.</P>
<P>Two days after this we quitted
Chester, I in the stage coach, and he on
horseback. He came with me as far as
Dunstable, about thirty-five miles from
London; then he told me fate and his
own misfortunes obliged him to leave
me, and I saw him preparing to go.</P>
<P>Being in the inn, I acquainted him I
had one favour to ask, which was, since
he could not go any farther, he would
give me leave to stay a week or two in
the town with him, that we might think
of something to prevent such a ruinous
thing to us both, as a final separation
would be: that I had something of mo∣ment
<PB N="181" REF="189"/>
to offer to him, which perhaps he
might find to our mutual advantage.</P>
<P>This was too reasonable to be denied:
so he called the landlady and told her,
his wife was taken so ill that she could
not go any farther, and asked if she
could get us a lodging for two or three
days, for the journey had been too
much for me? The landlady, who was
well-bred, and very obliging, came im∣mediately
to see me; told me, she had
two or three very good rooms in the
house, and if I saw them, she did not
doubt but I would like them, and I
should have one of her maids, to wait
on me. This was so kind, that I could
not but accept of it and thank her; so
we paid the stage-coachman, took out
our baggage and resolved to stay.</P>
<P>In the evening taking a walk into the
fields, I told him I would now acquaint
him with the proposal I had to make.
Accordingly I related to him how I had
lived in Virginia; that I had a mother,
I believed, was alive there still, though
my husband had been dead some years.</P>
<P>Then I entered into the manner of
peoples going over to tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e countries to
<PB N="182" REF="190"/>
settle; how they had a quantity of land
given them by the constitution of the
place; and if not, it might be pur∣chased
at so easy a rate that it was not
worth naming.</P>
<P>I then gave him a distinct account of
the nature of planting; how with carry∣ing
over two or three hundred pounds
value in English goods, a man of ap∣plication
would be certain to raise an
estate.</P>
<P>I let him into the nature of the pro∣duct
of the earth, how the ground was
prepared, and what the usual increase
of it was; and demonstrated in a few
years, with such a beginning, we should
be as certain of being rich, as we were
now certain of being poor.</P>
<P>He was surprised at my discourse; for
we made it the subject of our conversa∣tion
for near a week, in which time I
laid it down, that it was morally im∣possible,
but that we must thrive and do
well.</P>
<P>Then I told him what measures I
would take to raise a sum of three hun∣dred
pounds; and I argued how good a
method it would be to put an end to
<PB N="183" REF="191"/>
our misfortunes, and restore our cir∣cumstances,
to what we had both ex∣pected;
and I added, that after a few
years, if we lived, we might leave our
plantation in good hands, come over
again, receive the income of it, and
live here and enjoy it; and I gave him
examples of some that had done so, and
who now lived in very good circum∣stances
in London.</P>
<P>In short, I pressed him so, that he
almost agreed to it: but still something
or other broke it off again; until at
last he turned the tables, and began to
talk almost to the same purpose of Ire∣land.</P>
<P>He said, a man that could confine
himself to a country-life, and could
but find stock to enter upon any land,
could have a farm there for fifty pounds
a year, as good as were here let for
two hundred pounds; the produce was
such, and so rich the land, if much was
not laid up, we were sure to live hand∣somely
upon it: that he had laid a
scheme to leave me in London, and go
over and try; and if he found he could
<PB N="184" REF="192"/>
lay a foundation of living, he would
come over and fetch me, or, that if he
found nothing could be done in Ireland,
he would then come and join in my pro∣ject
for Virginia.</P>
<P>A month at Dunstable being expired▪
at last we parted, though with the ut∣most
reluctance on my side; and in∣deed,
he took his leave very unwilling∣ly
too, but necessity obliged him: why
he would not come to London, I un∣derstood
more fully afterwards.</P>
<P>I came to London the next day, and
took a lodging in St. John's Street,
Clerkenwell. Here, I had leisure to re∣flect
upon the last seven months ramble;
the pleasant hours I had with Mr.
Carrol, I looked back with infinite plea∣sure;
but that pleasure was very much
lessened, when I found, some time after,
that I was with child.</P>
<P>Before I became acquainted with Mr.
Carrol, I had taken care to preserve a cor∣respondence
with my friend at the bank, or
rather he took care to correspond with me,
for he wrote to me frequently. I also
wrote to him, and I left directions in
Lancashire, so that I had those letters,
<PB N="185" REF="193"/>
which he sent, conveyed to me, and
during my recess in Saint John's Street,
I received a very obliging letter from
him, that if I would come to town he
should shortly be ready to fulfil his en∣gagements;
assuring me his process for
a divorce from his wife went on with
success, though he met with some dif∣ficulties
in it that he did not expect.</P>
<P>I was not displeased that his process
was more tedious than he expected;
for though I was in no condition to
have him, being with child, yet I was
not willing to lose him, and resolved to
have him if he continued in the same
mind, as soon at I was up again; for I
saw apparently I should hear no more
from Mr. Carrol; and as he had all
along pressed me to marry, and had
assured me he would not ever offer to
claim me again, so I made no scruple to
resolve to do it if I could, if my city-friend
stood to his bargain; and I had
a great deal of reason to be assured that
he would stand to it, by the letters he
wrote.</P>
<P>As I had not the least suspicion of my
being with child, when I came to town,
<PB N="186" REF="194"/>
I passed for a widow; but now grow∣ing
big, my landlady where I lodged
perceived it, and began to take notice
of it, and as far as civility would al∣low,
intimated that I must think of re∣moving.
Upon this, I told her my case,
as it really was; and that my husband,
Mr. Carrol, was gone to Ireland, and
begged her advice and assistance in what
I should do.</P>
<P>My landlady was not so great a
stranger to such cases as mine, as I
thought at first she had been, and she
sent for a midwife. When she came,
my landlady said, “Mrs. Broadwell,
I believe this lady's trouble is of a
kind that is pretty much in your way,
and therefore, if you can do any thing
for her, pray do, for she is a very civil
lady,” and immediately she went out of
the room.</P>
<P>I really did not understand her: but
Mrs. Broadwell began very seriously to
explain what she meant. “Madam, you
seem not to understand what your land∣lady
means: She means that you are
under some circumstances that may
render your lying-in difficult, and that
<PB N="187" REF="195"/>
you are not willing to be exposed; I
need say no more. If you think fit to
commu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icate so much of your case, as
is necessary, I may be in a condition to
assist you, and to make you perfectly
easy.”</P>
<P>I was too sensible of the want I was
in of such a woman, not to accept her
offer. I told her my case was partly as
she guessed, and partly not; for I was
really married, and had a husband, tho'
he was in such circumstances, and so re∣mote
at that time, as that he could not
appear publickly.</P>
<P>She, with a deal of respect, told me,
that was none of her business; all the
ladies that came under her care were mar∣ried
women to her; every woman what
is with child has a father for it, and
whether that father was a husband or
not, was no business of her's; her busi∣ness
was to assist me in my present cir∣cumstances,
whether I had a husband or
no; “for, madam, to have a husband
that cannot appear, is to have no hus∣band
in the sense of the case, and there∣fore,
whether you are a wife or not is
all one to me.”</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="196"/>
I soon found, that whether I was a
wife or a mistress, I was to pass for a
mistress with her. I said, however, if I
must tell her my case, I must tell it her
as it was: So I related it, and con∣cluded
thus; “I trouble you with all
this, madam, not that it is much to the
purpose in your affair, but this is to the
purpose, namely, that I am not in any
pain about being seen, or being publick
or concealed, for it is perfectly indif∣ferent
to me; but my difficulty is, that
I have no acquaintance in this part of
London.”</P>
<P>“I understand you, madam; you
have no security to bring to prevent the
parish impertinences usual in such cases;
and perhaps, do not know very well
how to dispose of the child when it
comes.”</P>
<P>“The last, says I, is not so much my
concern as the first.”</P>
<P>“Well, madam, I live in Saint John's
Square, and though I do not enquire
after you, you may enquire after me,
for I have many ladies that come to
my house to lye-in. I have given secu∣rity
to the parish to secure them from
<PB N="189" REF="197"/>
any charge, from whatsoever shall come
into the world under my roof. I have
but one question to ask, madam, and if
that be answered, you shall be entirely
easy for all the rest.”</P>
<P>“Madam, I believe I understand
you. I thank God, though I want
frends in this part of the world, I do not
want money, so far as may be necessary,
though I do not abound in it.”</P>
<P>This I added, because I would not
make her expect great things.</P>
<P>“Well, madam, that is the thing in∣deed,
without which nothing can be
done in these cases; and yet, you shall
see I will not impose upon you, or offer
any thing that is unkind to you; and if
you desire it, you shall know every thing
beforehand, that you may suit yourself
to the occasion.</P>
<P>I told her, she seemed to be perfectly
sensible of my condition: that I had no∣thing
to ask of her but this, that as I had
told her that I had money sufficient, but
not a great quantity, she would order it
so, that I might be at as little super∣fluous
charge as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="198"/>
She replied, that she would bring in
an account of the expences of it in two
or three shapes, and like a bill of fare,
I should choose as I pleased; and I de∣sired
her to do so.</P>
<P>The next day she came, and the copy

<P><PB N="192" REF="200"/>
I looked upon all the three bills, and
smiled, and told her I did not see but
that she was very reasonable in her de∣mands,
all things considered, and that
I did not doubt but her accommodations
were good; and added, I was sorry to
tell her that I feared I must be her low∣est
rated customer, “and perhaps, ma∣dam,
you will make me the less welcome
upon that account.”</P>
<P>“No, not at all: but if you doubt
my care, I will allow any friend you have
to overlook, and see if you are well
waited on, or no.”</P>
<P>I smiled, and told her I would come
and be her customer; but I told her
also, that as I had two months to go, I
might perhaps be obliged to stay longer
with her than three months, and desired
to know if she would not be obliged to
remove me before it was proper.</P>
<P>“No, she said her house was large,
and besides, she never put any body to
remove, that had lain in, until they
were willing to go; and if she had more
ladies offered she could provide accom∣modation.”</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="201"/>
As soon as I could, I went with the
maid to see the house, and the apart∣ment
I was to have; every thing was so
handsome and so clean, I was wonder∣fully
pleased with what I had met with,
which, considering the melancholy cir∣cumstances
I was in, was far beyond
what I looked for.</P>
<P>To bring this part into as narrow a
compass as possible, I quitted my lodg∣ing
and went to my governess, for so
they called her in the house, and there I
was treated with so much courtesy, so
carefully looked to, and so handsomely
provided, that I was surprised at it, and
could not at first see what advantage my
governess made of it; but I found
afterwards that she professed to make no
profit of the lodgers diet, nor could
she get much by it, but her profit lay
in the other articles of her management,
and she made enough that way, for it
is scarce credible what practice she had,
yet all upon the private account, or, in
plain English, intriging.</P>
<P>While I was in her house, which was
near four months, she had above thirty
<PB N="194" REF="202"/>
unhappy young woman, who made a
good figure, brought to bed under her
care, who were chiefly girls in keep∣ing.</P>
<P>This was a testimony of the vice of
the age, and such a one, as bad as I had
been, it shocked me; I began to nau∣seate
the place, and above all, the
wicked practice; yet I must say that I
never saw, or do I believe there was to
be seen, the least indecency in the house
the whole time I was there.</P>
<P>Not a man was ever seen to come up
stairs, except to visit the lying-in ladies
within their month, nor then without
the old lady with them, who made it a
piece of the honour of her management,
that no man should touch a woman,
within the month; nor would she per∣mit
any man to lie in the house upon
any pretence whatever, though she was
sure it was with his own wife; and her
saying for it was, she cared not how
many children were born in her house,
but she would have none got there if she
could help it.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="203"/>
Before I was brought to bed, I re∣ceived
a letter from my trustee at the
Bank, full of kind obliging expressions,
earnestly pressing me to return to Lon∣don.
It was near a fortnight before
it came to me, because it had been first
sent into Lancashire, and then directed
to me at my lodging in Saint John
Street as I before had ordered. He con∣cluded
with telling me he had obtained
a decree against his wife, and that he
would be ready to make good his en∣gagement,
if I would accept of him;
adding a great many protestations of
kindness and affection.</P>
<P>I returned an answer, and dated it at
Leverpoole, but sent it by a messenger,
alledging that it came in cover to a
friend in town. I gave him joy of his
deliverance, but raised some scruples;
and told him, I supposed he would con∣sider
seriously before he resolved, the
consequence being too great for a man
of his judgment to venture rashly; so
concluded, wishing him well in what∣ever
he did resolve, without letting him
into any thing of my own mind, or
<PB N="196" REF="204"/>
giving any answer to his proposal of my
coming to London, but mentioned my
intention to return the latter end of the
year.</P>
<P>I was brought to bed about the mid∣dle
of May, of a fine boy; and in
about three weeks after I lay-in, I re∣ceived
another letter from him, with
the news that he had such an answer to
give to all my scruples about his marry∣ing
again, as I could not expect; for
his wife, who had been under some re∣morse
before for her usage of him, as
soon as she heard the account that he
had gained his point, had very unhap∣pily
destroyed herself.</P>
<P>He expressed himself very handsome∣ly
as to his being concerned at her dis∣aster,
and that he had only done him∣self
justice in a case in which he was no∣toriously
injured: However, he had no
view of any satisfaction left in this
world, but only in the hope that I
would come and relieve him by my
company. Then he pressed me, that I
would come to town and let him see me,
<PB N="197" REF="205"/>
when he would farther enter into dis∣course
about it.</P>
<P>I was surprised at the news, and be∣gan
seriously to reflect on my circum∣stances,
and the misfortune it was to
have a child; and what to do I knew
not. I appeared melancholy for several
days, and my governess questioned me
continually to know what troubled me.
I could not tell her I had an offer of
marriage, after I had so often told her I
had a husband. I owned I had some∣thing
which very much troubled me,
but said, “I could not reveal it.”</P>
<P>She still continued importuning me.
It was impossible, I told her, to discover
the secret. This, instead of being an
answer, encreased her importunities; she
urged her having been trusted with the
greatest secrets; that it was her business
to conceal every thing, and to discover
things of any nature would be her ruin;
she asked me if ever I had found her
tattling of other peoples affairs, and
how could I suspect her? and to unfold
myself to her, was telling it to no∣body;
<PB N="198" REF="206"/>
she was silent as death; it must
be a strange case indeed, that she could
not help me out of; but to conceal it,
was to deprive myself of all possible
help, or means of help, and to deprive
her of the opportunity of serving me.
In short, she had such a bewitching elo∣quence,
and so great a power of per∣suasion,
there was no concealing any
thing from her.</P>
<P>At length, I told her the history of
my Lancashire marriage, how both of
us had been disappointed, how we came
together, and how we parted. Here I
told her what a good offer I had; pro∣duced
her my friend's two last letters,
inviting me to come to London, and
shewed her with what affection and
earnestness they were written.</P>
<P>She fell a laughing, and told me the
other was no marriage, but a cheat on
both sides; and as we were parted by
mutual consent, the nature of the con∣tract
was destroyed, and the obligation
was mutually discharged. She had ar∣guments
for this at the tip of her
tongue; and in short, reasoned me out
<PB N="199" REF="207"/>
of my reason; not but that it was too
by the help of my own inclination.</P>
<P>Then came the great and main dif∣ficulty,
and that was the child. This
she told me must be removed, so as
it should never be possible for any one
to discover it. I knew there was no
marrying without entirely concealing
that I had had a child, for he would
soon discover by the age of it, that it
was born, nay, and gotten too, since my
acquaintance with him.</P>
<P>But it touched my heart to think of
parting with the child. I could not
think of it, without horror. I wish all
those women who consent to the dis∣posing
of their children out of the way,
as it is called for decency sake, would
consider that it is only a contrived me∣thod
for murther; that is to say, a kill∣ing
their children with safety.</P>
<P>It is manifest to all that understand
any thing of children, that we are born
helpless, and uncapable either to sup∣ply
our own wants, or so much as
make them known; and that without
help, we must perish; and this help re∣quires
not only an assisting hand, whe∣ther
<PB N="200" REF="208"/>
of the mother, or somebody else,
but there are two things necessary in that
assisting hand, that is, care and skill,
without both which, half the children
that are born would die. I question not,
but these are partly the reasons why
affection was placed by nature in the
hearts of mothers; or they would never
be able to give themselves up to the
care and waking pains needful to the
support of their children.</P>
<P>Since this care is needful to the life of
children, to neglect them is to murther
them; to give them up to be managed
by those people, who have none of that
needful affection placed by nature, is
to neglect them in the highest degree;
nay, in some it goes farther, and is a
neglect in order to their being lost; so
that it is even an intentional murther,
whether the child lives or dies.</P>
<P>All those things represented them∣selves
to my view, and that in the black∣est
and most frightful form; and as I
was very free with my governess, I re∣presented
to her the dark thoughts
which I had upon me about it, and
told her what distress I was in. She
<PB N="201" REF="209"/>
asked me if she had not been care∣ful,
and tender of me in my lying-in,
as if I had been her own child? “And
my dear, do you think there are not
women, who value themselves upon
their being as careful of children, as
their own mothers can be? Yes, yes,
fear it not; how were we nursed ourselves.
Are you sure you was nursed by your
own mother.”</P>
<P>She touched me to the quick, when
she asked me if I was sure that I was
nursed by my own mother. I trembled
at the very expression, and I looked at
her as if I had been frighted: but re∣flecting
that it could not be possible
for her to know any thing about me,
that disorder went off, and I began to
be easy.</P>
<P>At last, she said, “Come my dear,
I have found out a way how you shall
be certain that your child shall be used
well, and yet the people that take care
of it shall never know you, or who the
mother of the child is.”</P>
<P>“O madam, if you can do so, you
will engage me to you for ever.”</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="210"/>
“Well, are you willing to be at
some small expence, more than what
we usually give to the people we con∣tract
with?”</P>
<P>“Ay, madam, provided I may be
concealed.”</P>
<P>“As to that, you shall be secure;
for the nurse shall never so much as dare
to enquire about you, nay, you may
pass for an intimate acquaintance of the
mother, who does not chuse to appear,
by which means you may go and see it,
whenever you please, without any sus∣picion.”</P>
<P>“Why, do you think, that when I
come to see my child, I shall be able to
conceal my being the mother of it? do
you think that possible?”</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, if you discover
it, the nurse shall be forbid to ask any
questions about you, or to take any no∣tice.”</P>
<P>I was very well pleased with this, and the
next week the woman came from Hert∣ford
who was to take the child entirely
for ten pounds. She was a likely woman,
a cottager's wife, very clean and neat,
and I approved of her much. I pre∣tended,
<PB N="203" REF="211"/>
I was only an agent for the mo∣ther
of the babe, who did not chuse
to appear herself; but if she did her
duty by it, and the infant thrived, I
promised she should receive a guinea a
quarter, to defray her expences of bring∣ing
it to London, for me or any per∣son
I should appoint to see it; and with
a heavy heart, and many a tear, I let
her have my child, and away she went
with it.</P>
<P>From my behaviour, she certainly
knew I was the mother; but as my
care was over, which though it did not
satisfy my mind, yet was the most con∣venient
for me, as my affairs then stood,
of any that could be thought of at that
time, I was now determined to write to
my friend at the Bank; and the begin∣ing
of July I sent him a letter, that I
proposed to be in town some time in
August. He returned me an answer in
the most pleasing terms, and desired me
to let him have timely notice, and he
would come and meet me two days
journey. This puzzled me greatly:
once I was resolved to take the stage-coach
to West-Chester, on purpose only
<PB N="204" REF="212"/>
to have the satisfaction of coming back,
that he might see me really come in
the same coach; for I had a jealous
thought, lest he should think I was not
really in the country.</P>
<P>Having taken measures for my jour∣ney;
I took a place in the stage-coach,
not to its full extent, but to a place
called Stone in Cheshire, where I not
only had no manner of business, but
not so much as the least acquaintance
with any person in the town or near it.
But I knew that with money in my
pocket I should be at home any where;
so I lodged there two or three days,
until, watching my opportunity, I found
room in another coach, and took pas∣sage
back again for London, sending a
letter to him, that I should be on the
Monday evening following at the Crown
Inn at Stony-Stratford, where the coach∣man
told me he was to lodge. He also
acquainted me he had been hired to
carry some gentlemen and ladies to
West-Chester, who were going for Ire∣land,
was now returning, and did not
tie himself up to exact times or places
<PB N="205" REF="213"/>
as the stages do; however, the warn∣ing,
which I gave my friend, was so
short, he could not reach to Stony-Stratford
time enough to be with me
that night, but he met me at Brickill
the next morning, as we were just com∣ing
into the town.</P>
<P>I confess I was glad to see him, for
I thought myself disappointed over
night, as I had gone so far to contrive
my coming on purpose. He pleased me
doubly too by the figure he came in;
for he brought a very handsome coach
and four horses, with a servant to attend
him.</P>
<P>He took me out of the coach imme∣diately,
and putting into the same inn
he set up his own coach, and bespoke
a dinner. I asked him what he meant,
for I was for going on with the journey?
He said No; I had need of a little rest
upon the road, and that was a very
good house, though it was but a little
town; so we went no farther that night.
I did not press him much, for since he
had come so far to meet me, and put
himself to so much expence, it was
but reasonable I should oblige him.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="214"/>
After dinner we walked to see the
town, the church, and to view the fields,
and our landlord was our guide. I ob∣served
my friend enquired much about
the parson, which made me conclude,
he certainly would propose to be mar∣ried;
and though it was a sudden
thought, it followed, that in short, I
would not refuse him; for to be plain,
I was in no condition now to say No, I
had no reason now to run any more such
hazards.</P>
<P>While these thoughts were in agita∣tion,
I observed my landlord took him
aside and whispered to him, though not
very softly, for so much I over-heard,
“Sir, if you shall have occasion—”
the rest I could not hear.</P>
<P>I heard his answer, which was, “Very
well, I believe I shall.”</P>
<P>We were no sooner returned to the
inn, but he began with irresistable
words, since he had had the good for∣tune
to meet me, it would be hastening
his felicity if I would put an end to the
matter there. “What do you mean,”
says I, colouring a little; “what in an
inn! bless us, how can you talk so!”</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="215"/>
“O, very well,” says he, “I came a
purpose to talk so, and I will shew you
that I did.”</P>
<P>With that he pulls out a bundle of
papers.</P>
<P>“You fright me,” said I; “what are
all these?”</P>
<P>“Do not be frighted, my dear,” said
he, and kissed me; this was the first
time he had been so free to call me so.
Then he repeated it, “do not be fright∣ed,
you shall see:”</P>
<P>So he unrolls them, and takes out a
small shagreen case, and gives me a
very fine diamond ring. I made him a
curtsy, and accepted it. Then he takes
out another ring, “And this, is for
another occasion;” so he puts that in his
pocket.</P>
<P>“Well, but let me see it,” says I.</P>
<P>“Stay,” says he, “first look here.”
Then he took up a paper, and read it,
and behold! it was a licence for us to
be married.</P>
<P>“Why,” says I, “are you distracted?
you are fully satisfied that I would com∣ply,
and yield at first word, or resolve to
take no denial.”</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="216"/>
“The last, my dear, is certainly the
case.”</P>
<P>“But you may be mistaken,” said I.</P>
<P>“No, no,” says he, “how can you
think so? I must not be denied;” and
with that he fell to kissing me so vio∣lently,
I could not get rid of him.</P>
<P>There was a bed in the room, and
as we were walking, eager in discourse,
at last he takes me in his arms, and
threw me upon it; and holding me fast,
courted me to consent with such repeat∣ed
entreaties and arguments, protesting
his affection, and vowing he would not
let me go till I had promised him, that
at last I said, “Why, you resolve not to
be denied indeed, I think.”</P>
<P>“No, no, I won't be denied.”</P>
<P>“Well, well,” and giving him a
slight kiss, “then you shall not be de∣nied,
pray let me get up;” and he im∣mediately
left me.</P>
<P>He was impatient for my coming out
of my chamber; but finding me long,
he went down stairs, and, as I under∣stood
afterwards, talked with the land∣lord
about the parson. My landlord, an
<PB N="209" REF="217"/>
officious though a well-meaning fellow,
had sent away for the neighbouring
clergyman; and when my friend began
to speak of it, and talk of sending for
him, “Sir,” said he, “the clergyman is
in the house.”</P>
<P>When he came, he asked him if he
would venture to marry a couple of
strangers who were both willing? He
replied, the landlord had said some∣thing
to him of it; he hoped it was no
clandestine business; he seemed to be a
grave gentleman, and he supposed the
lady was not a girl, so that the consent
of friends should be wanted. “To put
you out of doubt, read this paper,” and
out he pulls the licence.</P>
<P>“I am satisfied, sir; where is the
lady.”</P>
<P>“You shall see her presently;” and he
came up and acquainted me with it.</P>
<P>I replied, “It is time enough in the
morning.”</P>
<P>“Why, my dear, he seemed to scru∣ple
whether it was not some young girl
stolen from her parents, and that made
him ask to see you.”</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="218"/>
“Well, well, sir, do as you please.”</P>
<P>So up he came, and a merry gentle∣man
he was. He had been told, we
were to have met last night at Stony-Stratford,
but that he could not reach so
far.</P>
<P>“Well, every ill turn has some good in
it; the disappointment, sir, was your's,
and the good turn is mine, for if you
had met at Stony Stratford I had not had
the honour to marry you.—Landlord
have you a common-prayer∣book?”</P>
<P>“Lord, sir, what do you mean?
what to marry in an inn, and at night
too!”</P>
<P>“Madam, if you will have it be in
the church you shall, but I assure you
your marriage will be as firm here; we
are not tied by the canons to marry no
where but in the church; and if you
will have it there, it will be as publick
as a country wake; and as for the time
of day it matters not; princes are mar∣ried
in their chambers, and at eight or
ten o'clock at night.”</P>
<P>I was a great while before I could be
persuaded, and pretended not to be wil∣ling
<PB N="211" REF="219"/>
to be married but in a church; but
at last I consented, and the landlord,
his wife, and daughter were called up:
My landlord was father and clerk, and
when the ceremony of marriage was
over, very merry we were; though I
confess the self-reproaches which I had
upon me before, lay close, and extorted
every now and then a deep sigh from
me, which my husband took notice
of, and endeavoured to encourage me,
thinking, that I had some little he∣sitations
at the step I had taken so
hastily.</P>
<P>The affair was managed so private,
that not a servant in the house knew of
it, for my landlady and her daughter
waited on me, and would not let any
of the maids come up stairs, except
while we were at supper. My land∣lady's
daughter I called my bridemaid,
and sending for a shop-keeper the next
day, I gave the young woman several
ribbons, and finding it was a lace-making
town, I gave her mother a piece of lace
for a cap.</P>
<P>One reason that my landlord was so
close was, he was unwilling the minister
<PB N="212" REF="220"/>
of the parish should hear of it; but for
all that somebody heard of it, so that
we had the bells set a ringing the next
morning early, and the musick, such as
the town would afford, under our win∣dow.
But the landlord brazened it out,
that we were married before we came
thither, only that being his former
guests, we would have our wedding∣supper
at his house. In short having
been disturbed by the bells in the morn∣ing,
we were so sleepy afterwards that
we lay in bed until almost twelve.</P>
<P>I begged my landlady, when I got
up, that we might not have any more
musick, nor ringing of bells; and she
managed it that we were very quiet.
But an unexpected circumstance inter∣rupted
all my mirth for some time. My
bed-chamber looked into the street▪
being alone, I had walked to the end
of the room, and it being a pleasant
warm day, I had opened the window,
and was standing at it for some air,
when I saw three gentlemen on horse∣back
go into an inn just opposite.</P>
<P>It is not to be conceived what a ter∣ror
I was in; for the second of the
<PB N="213" REF="221"/>
three, I knew to be Mr. Carrol my
Lancashire husband. I never was in
such a consternation in my life; I thought
I should have sunk into the ground,
my blood chilled in my veins, and I
trembled as if I had been in a cold fit
of an ague. There was no room to
question the truth of it: I knew his
cloaths, I knew his horse, and I knew
his face.</P>
<P>The first sensible reflection I made
was, that my new husband was not by
to see my disorder. The gentlemen had
not been long in the house but they
came to the window of their room. My
window at this time was shut: How∣ever,
I could not keep from looking
at them: there I saw him again, heard
him call to one of the servants of the
house, and received all the terrifying
confirmations of its being the same per∣son,
that were possible to be had.</P>
<P>My next concern was to know, if I
could, what was his business there; but
that was impossible. My imagination
had formed an idea, he had discovered
me, and was come to upbraid me with
ingratitude and breach of honour. At
<PB N="214" REF="222"/>
last, to my great satisfaction, I saw them
all three go out and travel on West∣ward;
had they gone towards London,
I should have been still in a fright, lest
I should meet him on the road, but
happily he went the contrary way.</P>
<P>We resolved to be going the next
morning; but about six o'clock in the
evening we were alarmed with a great
uproar in the street, and what should it
be but a hue and cry after three high∣waymen,
who had robbed two coaches
near Dunstable Hill, and notice had
been given, that they had been seen at
Brickill at such a house, meaning the
house where they had been.</P>
<P>The house was immediately beset and
searched, and the crowd having gather∣ed
about it, we had the news presently.
I was heartily concerned now another
way. I immediately acquainted my
landlord that I could answer those were
not the persons, for that I knew one of
them to be a very honest gentleman, and
of a good estate in Lancashire.</P>
<P>The constable was immediately in∣formed
of this, and came over to me
to be satisfied. I assured him, I saw the
<PB N="215" REF="223"/>
three gentlemen as I was at the win∣dow,
that I saw them afterwards at the
windows of the room they dined in;
and afterwards take horse, and could
assure him I knew one of them to be a
gentleman of a good estate, and an un∣doubted
character in Lancashire.</P>
<P>The assurance with which I delivered
this, gave the constable such satisfac∣tion,
that he immediately sounded a
retreat. What the truth of the matter
was I knew not, but certain it was that
the coaches were robbed at Dunstable
Hill; as to the three gentlemen, that
remains to be explained hereafter.</P>
<P>This alarm stopped us another day,
though my spouse was for travelling,
and told me, it was always safest after
a robbery, for the thieves were sure to
be gone when they had alarmed the
country: but I was afraid and uneasy;
and indeed principally, lest Mr. Carrol
should be upon the road, and should
chance to see me.</P>
<P>Bating this circumstance, I never
lived four pleasanter days together in
my life. I was a meer bride all this
while; and my new spouse strove to
<PB N="216" REF="224"/>
make me entirely easy in every thing,
and we came away the fifth day. My
landlord, because he saw me uneasy,
mounted himself, his son, and three
country fellows with fire-arms, and,
without telling us of it, followed the
coach, and would see us safe into Dun∣stable.</P>
<P>We got home to London that even∣ing,
and there I took possession of a
house well furnished, and a husband in
very good circumstances; so that I had
a prospect of a very happy life.</P>
<P>And, I lived with him in the ut∣most
tranquillity. He was a quiet sen∣sible
man, and in his business deligent
and just. As I abhorred the levity and
extravagance of my former life, I chose
now to live retired, frugal, and within
ourselves. I kept no company, made no
visits; minded my family, and obliged
my husband; and this kind of life be∣came
a pleasure to me.</P>
<P>We lived in an uninterrupted course
of ease and content for five years, when
a sudden blow, from an almost invisible
hand, blasted all my happiness, and
turned me out into the world in a con∣dition
<PB N="217" REF="225"/>
the reverse of all that had been
before it.</P>
<P>My husband having trusted one of
his fellow clerks with a sum of money,
too much for our fortunes to bear the
loss of, the clerk failed, and the loss
fell heavy on my husband; yet it was
not so great, but that if he had had
courage to have looked his misfortunes
in the face, his credit was so good,
that, as I told him, he would easily
recover it, for to sink under trouble is
to double the weight.</P>
<P>It was in vain to speak comfortly to
him: the wound had sunk too deep, it
was a stab that touched the vitals: he
grew melancholy and disconsolate, and
from thence lethargick, and died. I
had had two children by him, and I
was left in a dismal disconsolate state,
and in several things worse than ever:
First, I could have but little expec∣tation
of receiving the addresses of
another: that agreeable part had de∣clined
some time, and the ruins only ap∣peared
of what I had been; and that
which was worse than all, I was the most
dejected creature living. I that had en∣couraged
<PB N="218" REF="226"/>
my husband and endeavoured
to support his spirits under his trouble,
could not support my own; I wanted
that spirit, which I told him was so
necessary to him for bearing the bur∣then.</P>
<P>I lived two years in this dismal condi∣tion,
wasting that little I had, weeping
continually over my unhappy circumstan∣ces,
without the least hope or prospect
of help from God or man. And now I
had cried so long, and so often that
my tears were exhausted, and I began
to be melancholy, for I grew poor a∣pace;
I mean as to money, but as to
my cloaths, I made as good a figure in
person as ever.</P>
<P>For a little relief I left my house
and took lodgings, and as I was re∣ducing
my living I sold off most of my
houshold goods and plate, spending very
sparingly, and ekeing things out to the
utmost; but still when I looked before
me, my heart would sink at the inevita∣ble
approach of misery and want. O
let none read this without seriously re∣flecting
on the circumstances of a deso∣late
state: it will certainly make them
<PB N="219" REF="227"/>
think not of sparing what they have
only, but of looking up to Heaven for
support, and of the wise man's prayer:
“Lord! give me not poverty lest I
steal.”</P>
<P>In this distress of mind, walking by
Temple-Bar, I observed an office for
the hiring of servants, and went in. I
had no sooner entered the room, than
a gentleman of a grave deportment, ex∣treamly
neat in his dress, began a dis∣course
with me of the utility of the
place, imagining, by my appearance, I
was come in quest of a servant. I soon
undeceived him, by acquainting him
my case was the reverse, and added,
“though I had a small independence,
yet, if I could hear of a single gentle∣man,
advanced in years, who wanted a
housekeeper to manage his domestic af∣fairs,
I should have no objection to such
a confinement.”</P>
<P>Here the gentleman smiled, and said,
“Why advanced in years madam? You
are not old yourself;”</P>
<P>“It is for that reason, sir, I should
chuse he should be advanced in years,
<PB N="220" REF="228"/>
that neither he or myself should be cen∣sured.”</P>
<P>“Pardon me, madam, you never was
more out in your opinion; no age is
free from censure, especially with such
a companion, for upon my word you are
a very agreeable woman.”</P>
<P>“You flatter me, sir, though flattery
ought not to have the least effect upon
either of us, at our time of life, I
crave your pardon, sir, for this free∣dom,”
and was about to take my leave;
when he immediately replied, “What
are you thoughts of me madam? could
you confine yourself to such an old fel∣low
as I am?”</P>
<P>“Are you serious sir, and do you ex∣pect
as serious an answer, after what
you have said concerning censure.”</P>
<P>“Yes, upon the word of a man of
honour, I am: say what you please, I
promise it shall not offend me.”</P>
<P>“Why, then, sir, with the same sin∣cerity,
when hereafter you are acquainted
with my character, I promise to be faith∣ful
to your commands, as a housekeeper,
to the height of my abilities.”</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="229"/>
He then told me he came on pur∣pose
to provide himself, as I had offer∣ed;
that he was a batchelor, kept a
small house near Leicester Fields, with
only one maid-servant, and a man in
livery, and proposed taking me home
with him: which I objected to, and I
added, it would have a better appear∣ance
for me to follow him, that it
might be thought by his servants I had
heard of his wanting a house-keeper,
and that I came to enquire after the
place.</P>
<P>He approved of my caution, and bid
me follow him as soon as I pleased: but
before I left him, I acquainted him
with my name, and, also where I lived,
which was near Charing Cross; whe∣ther
he went to make an enquiry after
me, I could not be certain, but this I
am certain, I got to his house before
him; and while I was speaking to his
man, concerning his master, he came,
and pulling off his hat, asked me very
politely, who I would please to speak
with? and, desired me to walk in with
as great a seeming strangeness, as if he
had never seen me before.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="230"/>
This behaviour took off all suspi∣cion,
and, in the hearing of his servant,
I announced my errand, and in about a
quarter of an hour after, he ringing for
the maid; “Susan,” said he, “shew
Mrs. Bennet your house,” and attended
us himself with such pleasantry, and
good-humour, which I thought gave
me an earnest of my future happiness.</P>
<P>While we were above stairs, he said
before the maid, “When can you come
Mrs. Bennet?”</P>
<P>“As soon as you please, sir, after
Wednesday.”</P>
<P>“Well, then I shall expect you on
Thursday.” Presently afterwards we
came down, and I took my leave.</P>
<P>On the Thursday evening about eight
I went, and took possession as keeper of
the house, and though there were only
himself and me, he had ordered Susan to
provide a very genteel supper. Where I
found him in conversation extreamly
lively, agreeable, and polite in his man∣ners.</P>
<P>In a few days I was as free and easy,
as when I had been there a twelve-month,
for indeed he was of an en∣gaging
<PB N="223" REF="231"/>
temper, and, what made it more
so, he was pleased with my conduct.</P>
<P>His usual method was, after break∣fast,
to go to a coffee-house and read
the papers, and when the weather per∣mitted
to walk in the Park, until about
two, then came home to dine, and he
seldom went out afterwards.</P>
<P>He read much and was fond of
music: and one day, I not knowing he
was returned from his usual walk, he
heard both my voice and the harpsi∣chord;
upon his entrance into the room,
he exclaimed, “Bless me, Mrs Bennet,
I am quite enraptured; pray let me hear
you again.” When I had finished, he
took me from my seat with thanks, and
saluted me, which was the first kiss I
had ever received from him.</P>
<P>From this time, he frequently en∣treated
me to oblige him, as he called
it, and I was sure to meet with the same
reward, a salute; though at any other
time he took not the least freedom with
me.</P>
<P>This put me upon determining, the
first opportunity I had, that I would
play without his entreaty, which had
<PB N="224" REF="232"/>
its effect; for he added a pressure to
his salute, by drawing me to him, and
kissing me closely with warmth and
eagerness; at the same time making an
apology for the freedom he had taken.
Thus, from the small incident of a sa∣lute,
from one freedom to another, be∣fore
a month was expired, he came to
me one night, while I was asleep in my
bed; and to tell my fair reader a truth,
from the moment I received the first kiss,
I expected no less.</P>
<P>I mention this as a warning to all my
sex, who have the least regard for their
virtue, that whenever a master takes the
least liberty with a servant, which he
would willingly have her conceal, with∣out
great prudence and fortitude on her
side, that woman is sure to be ruined,
as I had, long before, most woefully
experienced.</P>
<P>At present, with me the case was
otherwise, it was what I secretly wished
for; though I gave him not the least
cause, from my behaviour, for him to
imagine I would submit to it; yet, I
who was acquainted with the frailty of
the other sex, as well as with the frailty of
<PB N="225" REF="233"/>
my own, knew from experience, when
he once deviated from the line of pru∣dence,
with me his servant, that his
folly would ripen, and that I should reap
the benefit of it, as, indeed, I did,
both to his satisfaction and my own.</P>
<P>He left me at day-break, for fear of
a discovery; and while I was preparing
the breakfast things, he came to me, in
the parlour, with his usual ease and free∣dom,
as if nothing had happened.</P>
<P>While we were at breakfast, I asked
him, smiling, “How he came to take
the freedom of coming to me as he
did?” and added, “I hoped it did not
proceed from any levity in my own beha∣viour.”</P>
<P>“Not in the least, my dear Mrs.
Bennet, I acquit you entirely; the design
was mine, and from the first hour you
consented to live with me, though I
never had resolution before sufficient to
put my design in practice; nor should I
have proceeded, as I have, so far I
will allow you to be an accessary, for
I should never have attempted it, if I
had not perceived, that by your tender∣ness,
<PB N="226" REF="234"/>
and engaging behaviour, I was not
disagreeable to you.</P>
<P>It cannot be supposed from what I
have said, throughout the whole of my
history, that I ever denied, or refused
to gratify him in any of his desires, in
a case wherein I found my interest so
highly connected; especially, when I
confess, I looked upon him in the light
of a husband.</P>
<P>Yet, as we were not children, pru∣dence
dictated to us, especially as to
himself, to be on our guard in our
amour, lest it should be visible to his
other servants; for by a detection, he
said, he should lose that character,
which he had so long preserved in∣violable;
and, he added, it would hurt
him more sensibly now in the opinion of
the world, than an affair of the like
kind, would have done in the height and
vigour of his youth.</P>
<P>Though his reasons were so just,
upon this topic, as, indeed, they were
upon every subject he discoursed upon,
yet, I could have been better pleased
if he had thought less of it; for
<PB N="227" REF="235"/>
though I enjoyed his company as usual,
yet, from the late freedom he had taken,
it was natural, and, indeed, it was what
I expected, to receive a more frequent
repetition of his folly than I experi∣enced.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding
what I have said, as
I was sensible he loved me, I could not
help but approving of his discretion;
for, he told me, as he had been ever
temperate, both with wine and women,
he was at this time, though sixty, hear∣ty
and hale, and, in my opinion, as
ever I knew a man of forty; as to my∣self,
though, I was forty-seven, it was
said, by those who knew me, I had as
much spirit and vivacity, and was as
elegant in figure, and flattered myself
as desirable, as I was when at the age of
thirty.</P>
<P>However, health, and inclination on
both sides, soon broke down the fences
which lay in his way; for, in so small
a family as his, where the parties have
already agreed, there are opportunities
sufficient to be found, in the twenty-four
hours, to satisfy their passions
<PB N="228" REF="236"/>
for love, as well as their passions for
hatred.</P>
<P>The kind and agreeable usage I re∣ceived
from this gentleman, can only be
found in a mind replete with benevo∣lence:
he studied to oblige me in all I
could desire, and we lived in the utmost
harmony, I loving, and being beloved,
without either Susan or William sus∣pecting
us; when, unluckily, the maid,
being disturbed one night by a noise of
fire, came running into my room to
acquaint me with it, when she unfortu∣nately
discovered us both together in bed.</P>
<P>This, as she afterwards said, employ∣ed▪
her thoughts in a different manner,
for she left the room in as great a
hurry, as when she came into it; which
gave my master an opportunity to leave
me also, who retired to his own apart∣ment:
as for the fire we heard no more
of it; but I being drest, and willing
to know what was became of Susan, I
went up to the room, there was she in
bed and William with her. I confess
I was pleased with this incident, and
while I was at breakfast with my master,
observing him to look very pensive,
<PB N="229" REF="237"/>
and thinking to relieve him, I related
the affair of William and Susan in the
garret.</P>
<P>After ruminating for some time, he
said, “They shall both go, for though
I have taken freedoms with you Mrs.
Bennet, yet, I will not countenance the
same in my servants, therefore they
shall go immediately; accordingly he
ordered me to send them up to him,
and without entering into any debate, he
paid them both their wages, and they
left the house within an hour.</P>
<P>After they were gone, I told him I
had had a little conversation with the
girl before she went. “Harkee Susan,”
says I, “It will be best for us both
to be silent; if you will not tattle about
my failings, with my master, I will
conceal yours, which you have had
with William.”</P>
<P>Susan replied, “I am obliged to you,
Madam; and now if you please, I will
relate this unfortunate affair. Curiosity,
Madam, that bane to our sex, prompt∣ed
me to be assured, for I had long
suspected it, of your having an intrigue
with my master; to accomplish this, I
<PB N="230" REF="238"/>
pretended I heard a cry of fire; I should
have observed, that before I came down to
you, I had made the same pretence to Wil∣liam;
he watching the opportunity of my
return, I no sooner got into my bed, but
he came there also, and he had not been
by me, I am sure, ten minutes, before
you made the fatal discovery.”</P>
<P>“Oh! Susan, Susan,” said I, “this
was not the first time you had been
together, from your own story I know it,
for, if it had, you would, upon your
finding him in your bed with you, have
made as real an outcry, in defence of
your virtue, as you before did a feign∣ed
one, on account of the fire. She
made not the least reply to this, but
went up to her master, where she was
discharged, as has before been related.</P>
<P>This part concerning ourselves, I
concealed from my master at present,
knowing it would affect him, for he
dreaded the censure of the world, and
could not bear the thought of being ex∣posed,
though in infirmities peculiar to
human nature.</P>
<P>Here I cannot help remarking how
we are apt to deceive ourselves: it never
<PB N="231" REF="239"/>
entered into our thoughts that Susan
suspected us, nay, we frequently flat∣tered
each other concerning our pru∣dence
in our amours; for we were not
like a boy and a girl, who are for
ever romping and toying together;
that was what deceived us; we did not
consider, there are other ways to cause
suspicion, than meerly the freedom of
kissing; the eye or the tongue at certain
periods, are as good interpreters, as
either the hand or the lips; this was
the case with us. Susan discovered his
fondness to behold me, she also disco∣vered
my desire to please, or my con∣cern
for his absence, and uncommmon
joy for his return, expressed, rather be∣coming
the fondness of an indulgent
wife, than could be expected from the
best of servants. These, as she after∣wards
told me, gave rise to that suspi∣cion,
as the reader has been so fully ac∣quainted
with.</P>
<P>But, to return: strange it is to tell,
he, who took every opportunity before,
when he had so many difficulties to sur∣mount,
now, by their absence, they
were removed, did not attempt to reap
<PB N="232" REF="240"/>
the advantage, and we lay in separate
beds, for several nights, as if we had
been the most virtuous male and fe∣male
breathing.</P>
<P>One morning, at breakfast, contrary
to my expectation, he, with great af∣fability,
enquired how I rested; with a
deal of good-nature, expatiated largely
on the amour of the girl, and said,
from what I had told him, he hoped
the affair would be buried in oblivion,
and taking me by the hand kissed me
with fervency.</P>
<P>We were near a fortnight without
either, man or maid, to supply their
places. I had a woman indeed to help
me in the day, but she left us in the
evening, so that we had the house to
ourselves until the morning; what use
we now made of it, is not materially ne∣cessary
for the reader to be acquainted
with.</P>
<P>Here I lived to the extent of my
wishes; but an unhappy accident hap∣pening,
as he rode out one morning for
an airing, his horse took fright, threw
him, and killed him upon the spot;
and his nephew, who was his heir at
<PB N="233" REF="241"/>
law, coming into possession, and, I
being looked upon as an incumbrance,
was accordingly discharged, and I re∣turned
to my former lodgings.</P>
<P>I had not been here long, the wea∣ther
being exceeding fine, I dressed my∣self
very genteely, with an intention to
dine with a lady of my acquaintance, a
linen draper's wife in Cornhill, whom I
had not seen for several years.</P>
<P>As I was going along Cheapside, I
was accosted by a gentleman, who, un∣der
a pretence of knowing me, asked
me where I was walking to; and, in
my way thither, I informed him. When
we came to the house, he civilly took
his leave; and I thought no more of
him.</P>
<P>In the evening after tea, as I was re∣turning
to my lodging, who should I
see but the very same gentleman; it
was very lucky, he said, to have the
pleasure of seeing me twice in one day,
and was exceeding pressing for me to
drink a glass of wine, which I refused;
at last, “Madam, will you please to ac∣cept
of a play?” I complying, he
handed me into a coach, and ordered
<PB N="234" REF="242"/>
the man to drive to Drury-Lane Play∣house,
where we sat in a front box;
between the acts, he prevailed upon me
to consent to sup with him, and, when
the play was over, to a tavern we went
where he treated me very genteely.</P>
<P>It now began to grow late, or rather
early, for it was one o'clock, and I
took notice of it, and told him, he must
excuse me, I could not stay any longer.
He was sensible it was late, he said, and
would see me home, which he accord∣ingly
did to my door, and I heard him
afterwards order the coachman to drive
him to Soho-Square.</P>
<P>When I got into my room, I rumi∣nated
what must be his thoughts con∣cerning
me, and, on the other hand,
he could not but wonder, at my thoughts
concerning himself; for though, in the
course of the evening, he frequently
saluted me, and was pleased to com∣pliment
me, as to my person; yet, as
it is the province of history to relate
facts, I do assure you, reader, to his
honour, however you may be disap∣pointed,
he never attempted to offer the
<PB N="235" REF="243"/>
least indecency, no more than if I had
been his own sister, or any other near
relation.</P>
<P>It may be wondered, from what I
have said, why we were together so
long; but that wonder will cease, when
I acquaint the reader, he was only de∣sirous
to hear my story, which I willing∣ly,
and readily, complied with; for
my trouble, as he was pleased to call it,
he made me a genteel present and at∣tended
me home, as I have related.</P>
<P>I profess I could not devise the mean∣ing
of his behaviour, though polite to
the highest degree; yet, as I had com∣plied
with his request, both in my
going to the play, and to the tavern to
supper, it was natural for him to expect
I would not refuse any liberties he
might offer; and to be candid with
you, I do acknowledge you have rea∣son
to think so; yet, as I have said,
these liberties he did not take.</P>
<P>My not seeing him for a week, I
concluded I should not see him again,
or, at least, as he knew where I lived,
he did not intend to come to my lodg∣ing;
but, in this I was also disappointed;
<PB N="236" REF="244"/>
for before a fortnight was expired he
came, and staid the evening with me.
Here I must be excused from relating
the particulars of this visit, and many
others which I afterwards received, in
all which he was ever very bountiful,
and a true friend he was, indeed, to me.</P>
<P>At the end of about seven months,
as I was walking alone one Sunday, in
Saint James's Park, to my surprise I
met Mr. Carrol my husband; who, by
his endearments, I perceived was as re∣joyed
to see me, as I was to see him; we
immediately left the Park, and retired to
my lodging.</P>
<P>Though I was rejoiced to find my
husband, I had a damp upon my spirits
concerning my generous friend, lest Mr.
Carrol should discover our intrigue,
which now I was determined to break
off; and what to do I knew not: in this
anxiety, I came to the resolution to re∣move,
under pretence the lodging was
not convenient for us both; to this my
husband complied with, and according∣ly
in a few days, we went away.</P>
<P>This I managed so secretly, that my
landlady knew not where we retired to;
<PB N="237" REF="245"/>
and though I never suspected her having
any suspicion of my criminalty with my
friend, yet as she knew I acknowledged
Mr. Carrol to be my husband, I na∣turally
expected she would acquaint the
gentleman, the next time he came, that
I had left her lodging, in the company
of my husband; which was contrary to
what I had related, for I passed with him
as a widow.</P>
<P>This, and the fear of my being dis∣covered,
either by him or my husband,
gave me great uneasiness; and as I knew
he, as usual, would call, therefore, in a
few days, I paid her a visit, when she
informed me he came on the Wednes∣day
evening, that she told him my hus∣band
was returned from Ireland, and had
taken me to some other lodging, but,
where, she could not inform him.</P>
<P>Though this account, which she gave
me, eased me of my fears, yet, as I
had received such noble and polite
usage from him, I was mortified to
think he must look upon me as a cheat,
in my pretending to be a widow, when
at the same time I was a wife; but, as I
never expected to see Mr. Carrol again,
<PB N="238" REF="246"/>
and as the reader is acquainted with the
death of my husband of the Bank, if
rightly considered, if he had known it,
I ought to pass for no other than a
widow; and, from that time to this, I
never saw him more.</P>
<P>My husband was exceeding kind, and
behaved with a deal of tenderness to∣wards
me, and pressed me to acquaint
him how I had subsisted in his absence.
Not chusing he should know of my late
amour, I pretended I had received a
legacy of one hundred pounds, by the
death of an aunt, of which, he might
see, I was then in mourning, though,
in truth, it was for the death of my
husband of the Bank. He seemed re∣joiced
at what I had told him, and made
no farther enquiry.</P>
<P>He then let me into his own affairs,
and said, “He had received a legacy
also, by the death of a very intimate ac∣quaintance;”
and indeed his appearance
was very genteel, with a bag-wig and
sword, with every thing suitable. Thus,
we lived with the greatest harmony, I
seldom being seen abroad, for reasons
well known to the reader, and he was as
<PB N="239" REF="247"/>
constant at home, for reasons best known
to himself.</P>
<P>I have observed Mr. Carrol appeared
very genteel, but how he maintained
me and himself, I was an entire stranger
to, nor did I enquire, though I must
confess the hue and cry after him at
Brickhill, as before mentioned, often
occurred to my mind, though I never
mentioned it to him; yet, I had a sus∣picion,
he took liberties on the road,
which if known, as I imagined, would
not have been to his credit; for he was
sometimes out early in a morning,
though at home the rest of the day,
however, as I said, this was only suspi∣cion;
but time gave it proof, for in
less than six months, I received the fol∣lowing
letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“My dear,</OPENER>
<P>Come to me immediately, and give
me that comfort, which only you can
bestow, from your affectionate hus∣band,</P>
<CLOSER><DATELINE>Newgate,
<DATE>March
15.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SIGNED>JAMES CARROL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<PB N="240" REF="248"/>
<P>I no sooner received this melancholy
epistle, than I hastened to his dismal
abode, where I found him fettered with
irons; and questioning him the reason of
his misfortues, he replied, “Do not be a∣alarmed
my love, I am only here upon a
suspicion of a robbery, said to be commit∣ted
yesterday morning upon Hounslow-Heath;
it seems as a lady was riding in
her chariot, a man on horseback, came
and demanded her money, watches and
rings; and took from her three guineas
and a silk purse; this man, they say,
was very like me, and mounted on a
horse very like mine, and before I got
to Smallbury Green, I was seized by
two or three men, carried before a ma∣gistrate
at Brentford, and he committed
me.”</P>
<P>“Oh! my dear, you have said
enough,” and I fell senseless on the
floor. When I recovered, I was desired
by the keeper of the mansion to de∣part,
and I came away in the utmost
horror of mind that can be conceived.</P>
<P>I saw him every day, and all the day;
and this being the long vacation, when
<PB N="241" REF="249"/>
the judges were on their circuits, I ob∣served
I was taken particular notice of by
several of the female prisoners, and I
wondered at the meaning of it. At
length my husband told me, I was
known in the place, and they said my
name was Mary Flanders, or, they ra∣ther
rudely, and vulgarly, called me
Moll Flanders.</P>
<P>I assured him, which was a truth,
that I never was within the place, be∣fore
I came to see him, to the best of
my knowledge; and therefore they must
be mistaken, in taking me for some other
person.</P>
<P>Bad as I had been, and whatever
they might know of me, I had never
been there as a felon, though my mo∣ther
had; therefore I concluded they
must be acquainted with some of my
intrigues. As to my taking upon me the
name of Flanders, it was, as I have
before said, to avoid a prosecution for
concealing my former husband's effects:
besides, the persons who pretended all
this, were entire strangers to me; there∣fore
I imagined they took me for some
<PB N="242" REF="250"/>
other woman, who might, like myself,
have assumed the name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon enquiry I found there had been a wo∣man in Newgate, who was extremely like me in her person; but she was not only well known to be a woman of the town, but she was as notori∣ously known to be a thief; and, for the latter, she was at this present time abroad under her sentence of transportation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>However, at length, the time for his
trial come on, and being arraigned, he
pleaded, not guilty; and neither the
lady or her servant being positive to
the identity of his person, also being
doubtful concerning her purse, with
other circumstances in his favour, he
was acquitted; but being detained upon
a second indictment, for taking a tor∣toiseshel
snuff-box, rimmed with gold,
from a silver-smith in the Strand, he
was found guilty to the value of thirty-nine
shillings, for which he received
sentence for transportation for seven
years.</P>
<P>The hearing this sentence pronounced,
gave me but little affliction; for as I
intended to be a sharer in his distress,
<PB N="243" REF="251"/>
I was resolved to accompany him; and
we soon learned it was very easy for him
to prevail upon the captain of the ship,
where there was money, to buy himself
off when he came to Virginia.</P>
<P>The reader may remember I had
formerly told him, when we were at
Dunstable, the advantages we might
reap by our going to Virginia, and that
I had a mother living there at that
time; but as it was several years since I
had heard from her, I imagined she must
now be dead; yet I hoped to partake
of part of her effects, as she said, when
I left her there, I might depend upon
her remembrance of me; and I told
him I had many views in going there,
as well upon my own account, as his;
for I could easily instruct him how to
manage himself, so as never to be a
servant, as he was not destitute of money,
which is a very necessary friend in such
a condition.</P>
<P>He smiled, and said, he did not tell
me he had money. I told him I hoped
he did not understand, that I should ex∣pect
any supply from him if he had:
though I had not a great deal, yet I did
<PB N="244" REF="252"/>
not want, and while I had any I would
rather add to him, than weaken him in
that article, seeing, whatever he had, I
knew, in his case, he would have occa∣sion
for it.</P>
<P>He expressed himself in a most tender
manner. He told me, what money he
had was not a great deal, that he would
never conceal any of it if I wanted it;
and he assured me he did not speak with
any such apprehensions; that he was
only intent upon what I had hinted to
him before he went: that here he
knew what to do with himself, but
there he should be the most helpless
wretch alive.</P>
<P>I told him he terrified himself with
that which had no terror in it: that as
he had money, he might not only avoid
the servitude, supposed to be the conse∣quence
of transportation, but begin the
world upon a new foundation; that he
could not but call to mind, it was what
I had recommended to him many years
before, and had proposed it for our
mutual subsistence, and restoring our
fortunes in the world; and I would tell
him now, that to convince him both
<PB N="245" REF="253"/>
of the certainty of it, and of my being
fully acquainted with the method, and
also fully satisfied in the probability of
success, that I would go with him freely,
and of my own choice, and perhaps
carry enough with me to satisfy him
that I did not offer it for want of being
able to live without assistance from him,
but that I thought his misfortunes had
been such, as were sufficient to recon∣cile
him to quitting this part of the
world, and living where no-body could
upbraid him with what was past; and
where he should look back on all his
disasters with infinite satisfaction, when
he should consider that his enemies
should entirely forget him, and that he
should live as a new man in a new
world, no-body having any thing to say
to him, or he to them.</P>
<P>I pressed this home to him with so
many arguments, and answered his ob∣jections
so effectually, that he embraced
me, and told me, I treated him with
such a sincerity and affection as over∣came
him; that he would take my ad∣vice,
and would strive to submit to his
fate, in hope of having the comfort of
<PB N="246" REF="254"/>
my assistance, of so faithful a coun∣sellor,
and such a companion in his
misery.</P>
<P>My husband took it kindly of me,
in my offer of attending him in his voy∣age
to Virginia; and I not only pro∣vided
materials proper to be used when
we came there, but I waited on the
captain of the ship who was to take
him, and with whom I agreed to go as
a passenger, letting him know I was
wife to Mr. James Carrol, one he was
appointed by the government to con∣vey
to Virginia, and begged him to fa∣vour
him as far as it was consistent with
his duty, for which I would pay him
any reasonable gratuity.</P>
<P>He very bluntly answered me, “Why,
look you madam, I have no power on
shore, but, when I have him on board,
I can do as I please, and no one can call
me to account.”</P>
<P>I replied, mildly, “Sir, I am not
disputing your power, I am soliciting
your clemency for an unfortunate gen∣tleman,
as I am sure you will think so
when you converse with him.”</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="255"/>
“As for matter of that, madam, I
and my father, have had pretty large
dealings with the unfortunate for these
fifty years past; but, as you was saying
he is a gentleman, you must apply to
those who have him now in their cus∣tody,
that he may be brought on board
privately, unknown to the others under
the same predicament, and when I have
him under my inspection, as I said be∣fore,
I can behave to him agreeable to
your inclinations.”</P>
<P>“I am highly obliged to you, sir,
for your advice, and, as you seem to
commiserate my case, you will add
greatly to the opinion I have already
entertained of your humanity towards
the distressed, if you will be pleased to
speak to those yourself, whom you have
advised me to apply to, for I would
not chuse that even the ship's crew,
should be acquainted with my husband's
disaster; and my further application is,
that he may be looked upon in the same
light as myself, as a passenger at large,
for which I promise to pay you thirty
guineas for our voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="256"/>
With his usual bluntness, he replied,
“Say no more, madam; it shall be
done.”</P>
<P>Accordingly I sent our utensils for
the cultivation of the land, also our
cloaths and other necessaries, which cost
us above one hundred and fifty pounds;
and when the time came for him to set
sail, the captain took my husband on
board with him, as if he had been his
intimate friend.</P>
<P>When we got to Gravesend, the cap∣tain
offered my husband a civility, which
he had no reason to expect; namely,
to let him go on shore, upon giving
his word that he would return on board
again.</P>
<P>Accordingly we both went on shore
with the captain, supped together in
Gravesend, and came back with him in
the morning: Here we bought ten do∣zen
of beer, wine and fowls, to accom∣modate
us in our passage.</P>
<P>We had a fair easterly wind sprung
up the third day after we came to the
Downs, and we sailed from thence the
tenth of April; nor did we touch any
more at any place, until being driven
<PB N="249" REF="257"/>
on the coast of Ireland by a very hard
gale of wind, the ship came to an an∣chor
in a little Bay, near the mouth of
a river which they said came down
from Limerick, and was the largest river
in Ireland.</P>
<P>Being detained by bad weather, the
captain took us on shore with him
again: He did it in kindness to my
husband, who bore the sea very ill,
and was very sick, especially when it
blew hard. Here we again bought store
of fresh provisions; when the weather
turning mild, and a fair wind, we set
sail again, and in two and forty days
came safe to the coast of Virginia.</P>
<P>When we drew near to the shore, I
addressed the captain in favour of my
husband, and begged he would be so
kind, as he was pleased to promise him
he would.</P>
<P>He replied, “Mrs. Carrol, you must
get somebody to come and buy your
husband as a servant, and who must an∣swer
for him to the governor of the
country if he is demanded. I returned
him thanks, and said I would leave it
<PB N="250" REF="258"/>
entirely to his management. Accordingly
he brought a planter to treat with him
for the purchase, and my husband was
sold to him in form, and went on shore
with him. After some time the planter
gave Mr. Carrol a certificate of his dis∣charge,
and an acknowledgement of his
having served him faithfully; and he
was free from him the next morning, to
go whither he would.</P>
<P>For this service the captain demanded
of him six thousand weight of tobacco,
which he said he was accountable for
to his freighter, and which he imme∣diately
bought for him, and I paid him
the thirty guineas besides, with which
he was abundantly satisfied.</P>
<P>It is immaterial to enter here into the
particulars of what part of the colony
of Virginia we settled in, for many rea∣sons:
it may suffice to mention, we
went into the great river of Potomack,
the ship being bound thither; and there
we intended to have settled, though
afterwards we altered our minds.</P>
<P>The first thing I did of moment,
after having got all our goods on shore,
<PB N="251" REF="259"/>
was to enquire after my mother and
brother, that fatal person who I mar∣ried,
as I have related at large. A little
enquiry furnished me with information,
that my mother, was dead; and that
my brother was alive, which I confess
I was sorry to hear; but which was
worse, he was removed from the planta∣tion
where he lived formerly, and where
I lived with him, and was with his son
in a plantation just by the place where
we landed, and were we had hired a
warehouse.</P>
<P>I was surprized at first: but as I ven∣tured
to satisfy myself that he could
not know me, I was not only easy, but
had a mind to see him, if it was possi∣ble,
without his seeing me. By inquiry,
I found out the plantation where he
lived, and with the assistance of a wo∣man,
who I got to help me, I came so
near that I saw the dwelling-house. I
asked the woman whose plantation that
was: she said, it belonged to one Mr.
Bennet; and looking out a little to our
right, there, says she, is the gentleman
that owns the plantation, and his father
with him.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="260"/>
“What are their christian names?”</P>
<P>“I know not what the old gentle∣man's
name is, but his son's name is,
Humphry, and I believe the father's is
so too.”</P>
<P>You may guess what a confused
mixture of joy and fright possest my
thoughts upon this occasion; for I im∣mediately
knew that this was my own
son, by that father she shewed me, who
was my own brother.</P>
<P>As they drew near to us, I said,
“Does he know you, Mrs. Owen?”</P>
<P>“Yes, if he hears me speak, he will
know me; but he can't see well enough
to know me or any-body else.”</P>
<P>This made me secure, and I let them
pass by me. It was a wretched thing
for a mother thus to see her own son, a
handsome young gentleman in affluent
circumstances, and durst not make her∣self
known to him. Let any mother,
who reads this, consider, and think
with what anguish of mind I restrain∣ed
myself; what yearnings of soul I
had in me to embrace him, and weep
over him: then sitting down on the
grass, I made as if I lay down to rest
<PB N="253" REF="261"/>
me, but turned from her and lying on my
face, wept, and kissed the ground that
he had set his foot on.</P>
<P>As I was going back again, a new
occasion of melancholy offered itself:
the woman began, as if she would tell
me a story to divert me. “There goes a
strange tale among the neighbours where
he formerly lived: The old gentleman
going to England, when he was a young
man, fell in love with a beautiful lady
there, and married her, and brought
her over hither to his mother, who was
then living. She lived here some years,
and had several children by him, of
which the young gentleman that was
with him now, was one; but after some
time, the old gentlewoman, his mother,
talking to her of something relating to
herself when she was in England, the
daughter-in-law began to be very un∣easy,
and in short, it appeared, that
she was her mother, and consequently,
that son was his wife's brother, which
she had had, by old Mr. Bennet, her
second husband: this struck the whole
family with horror, and put them into
such confusion, that the young lady
<PB N="254" REF="262"/>
would not live with him, and she, at
last, went away for England and has
never been heard of since:” she added,
she had left a sum of money, and had
tied her plantation for the payment of
it, to be made good to the daughter, if
ever she could be heard of, and that
the trust was left with this son, who
was the person that we saw with his
father.</P>
<P>This was news too good for me to
make light of, and filled my heart
with a thousand thoughts, what course
I should take: Here was a perplexity I
had not skill to manage myself; it lay
heavy upon my mind night and day,
so that Mr. Carrol perceived it, and
pressed me to tell him what it was trou∣bled
me. I told him I was troubled be∣cause
we must alter our scheme of set∣tling,
for that I found I should be
known, if I staid in that part of the
country, for that my mother being dead,
several of my relations were come into
that part where we then were, and that
I must either discover myself to them,
which in his present circumstances was
<PB N="255" REF="263"/>
not proper, or remove, and which to do
I knew not, and this it was that made
me so melancholly.</P>
<P>He joined with me, that it was by
no means proper to make myself known
to any-body in his circumstances; and,
therefore, he said, he would be willing
to remove to any other part of the
country, or even to any other country
if I thought fit. But now I had ano∣ther
difficulty: if I removed to any other
colony, I put myself out of the way of
making a search after those effects
which my mother had left. Again, I
could never think of breaking the secret
of my former marriage to Mr. Carrol;
it was not a story that would bear re∣lating,
nor could I tell what might be
the consequences of it. In this per∣plexity
I continued, and this made Mr.
Carrol uneasy; for he thought I was
not open with him, and he would often
say he wondered what he had done,
that I would not trust him with what∣ever
it was. The truth is, he ought to
have been trusted, for no man could de∣serve
better of a wife; but this was a
<PB N="256" REF="264"/>
thing I knew not how to open to him,
and yet having nobody to disclose it
to, the burthen was too heavy upon my
mind. A secret of moment should al∣ways
have a confident, a bosom-friend,
to whom we may communicate the joy
of it, or the grief of it, be it which it
will, or it will be a double weight upon
the spirits, and perhaps become even
insupportable in itself; and this I ap∣peal
to all human testimony for the
truth of.</P>
<P>And this is the cause why many times
men, as well as women, and men of
the greatest and best qualities other∣ways,
yet have found themselves weak
in this part, and have not been able to
bear the weight of a secret joy; but
have been obliged to disclose it, even
for the meer giving vent to themselves,
and to unbend the mind, opprest with
the loads and weights which attended
it; nor was this any token of folly, or
thoughtlessness, but a natural conse∣quence;
and such people, had they
struggled longer with the oppression,
might have told it in their sleep, and
disclosed the secret, let it have been of
<PB N="257" REF="265"/>
what nature soever, without regard to
the person to whom it might be ex∣posed.
This necessity of nature is a
thing which works sometimes with such
vehemence, in the minds of those who
are guilty of any atrocious villainy,
such as secret murder in particularly,
that they have been obliged to discover
it, though the consequence would ne∣cessarily
be their own destruction. Now,
though it may be true that the divine
justice ought to have all the glory of
all those discoveries and confessions, yet
it is as certain that providence, which
ordinarily works by the hands of na∣ture,
makes use here of the same na∣tural
causes to produce those extraordi∣nary
effects.</P>
<P>As the publishing this account of my
life, is for the sake of the just moral of
every part of it, and for instruction,
caution, warning and improvement, to
every reader, so this will not pass, I
hope, for an unnecessary digression con∣cerning
some, who have disclosed the
greatest secrets either of their own, or
other peoples affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="266"/>
Under the certain oppression of this
weight upon my mind, I laboured in the
case I have been naming; and the only
relief I found for it, was to let my
husband into so much of it, as I thought
would convince him of the necessity
there was for us to think of settling
in some other place, and the next con∣sideration
before us, was, which part
of the English settlements we should go
to.</P>
<P>With this resolution, I proposed to
him our going away from where we
were, and carrying our effects with us to
Carolina; and my husband readily a∣greed,
that it was not proper to stay,
since I had assured him I should be
known: and the rest I effectually con∣cealed.</P>
<P>But now I found a new difficulty:
The main affair grew heavy upon my
mind still, and I could not think of
going out of the country without mak∣ing
enquiry into what my mother had
done for me; nor could I bear the
thought of going away, and not make
myself known to my child, only I
would have had this done without Mr.
<PB N="259" REF="267"/>
Carrol having any knowledge of it, or
they any knowledge that I had a hus∣band.</P>
<P>I had innumerable ways in my
thoughts how this might be done: I
would gladly have sent my husband a∣way
to Carolina, with all our goods,
and have come after myself. But this
was impracticable, he would never stir
without me, being himself unacquainted
with the country, and with the methods
of settling there, or any where else.
Then I thought we would both go first
with part of our goods, and that when
we were settled I should come back to
Virginia, and fetch the remainder; but
even then I knew he would never part
with me, and be left there alone.</P>
<P>These were therefore difficulties un∣surmountable,
and such as I knew not
what to do in. I had such strong impres∣sions
on my mind about discovering
myself to Mr. Bennet, that I could not
withstand them; and the rather, be∣cause
if I did not do it, while he lived,
I might in vain endeavour to convince
my son afterwards that I was his mo∣ther,
and so might both lose the assist∣ance
<PB N="260" REF="268"/>
and comfort of the relation, and
the benefit of whatever it was my mo∣ther
had left me; and yet on the other
hand, I could never think it proper to
discover to either of them that I had
a husband with me; on which account
it was absolutely necessary to remove
from the place where I was, and come
again, as from another place, and in a∣nother
figure.</P>
<P>Upon those considerations, I went on
with telling my husband the absolute
necessity there was of our not settling
in Potomack river, at least that we
should be presently made publick there,
whereas, if he went to any other place,
we should come in with as much repu∣tation
as any family that came to
plant: That as it was always agreeable
to the inhabitants to have families come
among them, who brought substance,
either to purchase plantations, or begin
new ones; so we should be sure of a
kind reception, and without any possi∣bility
of a discovery.</P>
<P>I told him too, as I had several rela∣tions
in the place where we were, that
I durst not now let myself be known
<PB N="261" REF="269"/>
to them, because they would soon come
into a knowledge of him, which would
be to expose myself to the last degree;
so I had reason to believe that my mo∣ther
who died here had left me some∣thing,
and perhaps considerable, which
it might be well worth my while to en∣quire
after; but this could not be done
without exposing us publickly, unless
we went from hence; and then wherever
we settled, I might come as it were to
visit and to see my brother and nephew,
make myself known to them, claim and
enquire after what was my due, be re∣ceived
with respect, and at the same
time have justice done me with chear∣fulness;
whereas if I did it now, I
could expect nothing but with trouble,
such as exacting it by force, receiving
it with curses and reluctance, and with
all kinds of affronts, which he would
not perhaps bear to see; that in case of
being obliged to legal proofs of being
really her daughter, I might be at a loss,
be obliged to have recourse to England,
and it may be to fail at last, and so lose
it, whatever it might be. With these
arguments, and having thus acquainted
<PB N="262" REF="270"/>
my husband with the secret so far as
was needful to him, we resolved to go
and seek a settlement in some other colo∣ny,
and at first, Carolina was the place
we pitched upon.</P>
<P>In order to this, we made enquiry
for vessels going to Carolina, and in a
very little while got information, that
on the other side the Bay, in Maryland,
there was a ship which came from Ca∣rolina
loaden with rice, and was going
back again thither, and from thence to
Jamaica. On this news we hired a sloop
to take in our goods, and, taking a final
leave of Potomack river we went with
all our cargo over to Maryland.</P>
<P>This was a long, an unpleasant, and
a dangerous voyage, considerably worse
than our voyage from England; the
very thought of it now strikes me with
horror, even though the danger is past.</P>
<P>However, thanks be to God, we got
safe: and behold, when we came thither,
the ship bound to Carolina was loaded
and gone three days before. This was
a disappointment: but I, that was to be
discouraged with nothing, told my hus∣band
that since we could not get a pas∣sage
<PB N="263" REF="271"/>
to Carolina, and as the country we
were in was very fertile, we would, if
he liked it, settle here.</P>
<P>We immediately went on shore, but
found no conveniences; but were di∣rected
by an honest Quaker, who we
found there, to go to a place about
sixty miles east; where he said he lived,
and where we should be accommodated,
either to plant, or to wait for any other
place to plant in that might be more
convenient: and he invited us with so
much kindness, that we agreed to go,
and the Quaker himself went with us.</P>
<P>Here we bought us an English wo∣man-servant
just come on shore from a
ship of Leverpool, and a negro man∣servant;
both absolutely necessary for
all people who settle in that country.
This honest Quaker was very helpful to
us, and when we came to the place he
proposed, found us out a convenient
store-house for our goods, and lodging
for ourselves and servants; and, in
about two months, we took up a large
piece of land from the governor of that
country, in order to form our planta∣tion:
<PB N="264" REF="272"/>
so we laid the thoughts of going
to Carolina aside, having been well re∣ceived,
and accommodated with a con∣venient
lodging, until we could have
land enough cured, and timber and
materials provided for building us a
house, all which we managed by the
direction of the Quaker; so that in one
year we had near fifty acres of land
cleared, part of it enclosed, and some
of it planted with tobacco; besides, we
had garden-ground and corn sufficient
to supply us with roots, herbs and
bread.</P>
<P>And now I persuaded my husband to
let me go, and enquire after my friends.
He was the willinger to consent to it
now, because he had business upon his
hands sufficient to employ him, besides
his gun to divert him, and which he
greatly delighted in. Accordingly I
went to the plantation where my bro∣ther
lived, and was fully resolved to
tell him who I was; but not knowing
what temper I might find him in, or
how much out of temper, rather, I
might make him by such a rash visit, I
<PB N="265" REF="273"/>
wrote to him, to let him know that I
was come not to give him any trouble
about our former affair, which I hoped
was entirely forgot; but that I applied
to him as a sister to a brother, desiring
his assistance in the case of that provi∣sion,
which our mother, at her decease,
had left for my support, and which
I did not doubt but he would do me
justice.</P>
<P>I said some very tender things in the
letter about his son, which I told him
he knew to be my own child, so I
hoped he would allow me the most pas∣sionate
desire of once seeing my one
and only child, and of shewing some∣thing
of the infirmities of a mother in
preserving a violent affection for him,
who had never been able to retain any
thought of me one way or other.</P>
<P>I did imagine that when he received
my letter, he would give it to his son
to read; but it fell out better: for as
his sight was dim, he had allowed his
son to open all letters that came to his
hand for him, and he being from home,
my letter came directly to my son's
hand, and he opened and read it.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="274"/>
He called the messenger in, and asked
him where the person was who gave
him the letter. The messenger told him
the place; so he bid him stay, and or∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
a horse to be got ready, and two
servants to attend him, away he came to
me with the messenger. Let any one
judge the consternation I was in, when
my messenger told me the old gentle∣man
was not at home, but his son was
come along with him, and was coming
up to me. I was perfectly confounded,
for I knew not whether it was peace or
war: However, I had but a few mo∣ments
to reflect, for my son was at the
heels of the messenger, and asked the
fellow, which was the gentlewoman that
sent him. There she is, Sir: at which
he came directly up to me, kissed me,
took me in his arms and embraced me
with so much tenderness, that he could
not speak; but I could feel his breast
heave and throb like a child, that sobs,
and cannot cry it out.</P>
<P>I can neither express or describe the
joy that touched me, when I found,
that he came not as a stranger, but as
a son to a mother, and indeed as a son,
<PB N="267" REF="275"/>
who had never before known what a
mother of his own was: In short, we
cried over one another a considerable
while, when at last he broke out, “My
dear mother, are you still alive! I
never expected to have seen your face:”
as for me, I could say nothing for a
considerable time.</P>
<P>After we had both recovered our∣selves,
and were able to speak, he said,
“As to what I had written to his father,
he had not shewed my letter, or told
him any thing about it; that what his
grandmother left me, was in his own
hands, and he would do me justice to
my full satisfaction; as to his father,
he was old and infirm, both in body and
mind, that he was almost blind, and
capable of nothing; and he questioned
whether he would know how to act in
an affair of so nice a nature, and there∣fore
he had come, as well to satisfy
himself in seeing me, which he could
not restrain himself from, as also to put
it into my power to make a judgment,
after I had seen how things were, whe∣ther
I would discover myself to his fa∣ther,
or no.”</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="276"/>
This was so prudently and wisely
managed, that I found my son needed
no direction from me. I told him as he
knew better than I what his father's
condition was, I should readily join
with him in such measures as he would
direct.</P>
<P>My son then enquired where I lived.
I told him I was on the Maryland side
of the Bay, at the plantation of a par∣ticular
friend, who came from England
in the same ship with me; as for that
side of the Bay where he was; I had no
habitation. He said, I should go home
with him, and be with him, if I pleased,
as long as I lived: That as to his fa∣ther
he knew nobody, and would never
so much as guess at me. I considered
of that a little, and told him, though it
was really a concern to me to live at a
distance from his father; yet I could
not say it would be the most comforta∣ble
thing to me to live in the house
with him; and to have that unhappy
object always before me, which had
been such a blow to my peace before;
that though I should be glad to have
your company, my son, or to be as near
<PB N="269" REF="277"/>
you as possible while I staid, yet I could
not think of living in the house where
I should be always so under restraint,
for fear of betraying myself in my dis∣course,
nor should I be able to refrain
some expressions in my conversing with
you, as my son, that might discover the
whole affair, which would by no means
be convenient.</P>
<P>He acknowledged that I was right:
but then, dear mother, you shall be
as near me as you can; so he took
me with him on horseback to a planta∣tion
next to his own, and where I was
well entertained. Having first called me
his aunt, and telling me he would talk
of the business the next day, he left me,
and about two hours after, he sent me
a maid-servant, and a negro boy to wait
on me, and provisions ready dressed for
my supper. I began now secretly to
wish that I had not come with my hus∣band
from England. However, that
wish was not hearty neither, for I loved
Mr. Carrol entirely, as indeed I had
ever done from the beginning; and he
merited from me as much as it was pos∣sible
for a man to do.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="278"/>
The next morning he came again,
and after a little discourse, he took out
a dear-skin bag, and gave it me, with
fifty Spanish pistoles in it, and told me
that was to supply my expences from
England. Then he pulled out his
grandmother's will, and read it over,
where it appeared, she had left a small
plantation on York river, where my
mother lived, to me, with the stock of
servants and cattle upon it, and given it
in trust to this son of mine for my use,
whenever he should hear of my being
alive, and to my heirs, and in default of
heirs, to whomsoever I should, by will,
dispose of it; but gave the income of
it, until I should be heard of, or
found, to my said son; and if I should
not be living, then it was to him and
his heirs.</P>
<P>The plantation, he said, he did not
let, but managed it by a clerk, as he
did another that was his father's, that
lay by it, and went over himself three
or four times a year to look after it. I
asked him what the plantation might be
worth: he said, if I would let it, he
would give me sixty pounds a year for
<PB N="271" REF="279"/>
it; but if I would live on it, then it
would be worth much more, and he be∣lieved
would bring me in one hundred
and fifty pound a year; but seeing I
was likely either to settle on the other
side the Bay, or might perhaps have a
mind to go back to England again, if
I would let him be my steward he would
manage it for me, as he had done for
himself, and that he believed he should
be able to send me as much tobacco to
England from it, as would yield me
about one hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>This was strange news to me; and
really my heart began to look up more
seriously, than I think it ever did be∣fore,
and to look with great thankful∣ness
to the hand of providence, which
had done such wonders for me; and I
must again observe, that not on this
occasion only, but even on all other oc∣casions
of thankfulness, my past life
never looked so monstrous to me, and
I never so compleatly abhorred it, and
reproached myself with it, as when
I had a sense upon me of provi∣dence
doing good to me, while I had
<PB N="272" REF="280"/>
been making those vile returns on my
part.</P>
<P>But I leave my readers to improve
these thoughts, as no doubt they will
see cause, and I go on to the fact.
My son's tender carriage, and kind of∣fers
fetched tears from me, almost all
the while he talked; indeed I could
scarce discourse with him, but in the in∣tervals
of my passion. However, at
length I began, and expressing myself
with wonder at my being so happy to
have the trust of what I had left put
into the hands of my own child, I told
him that as to the inheritance of it, I
had no other child, and was now past
having any, if I should marry, and
therefore would desire him to get a
writing drawn, which I was ready to
execute, by which I would, after me,
give it wholly to him, and to his heirs;
and in the mean time, smiling, I asked
him, what made him continue a bat∣chelor
so long? His answer was kind
and ready, that Virginia did not yield
any great plenty of wives, and that
since I talked of going back to Eng∣land,
<PB N="273" REF="281"/>
I should send him a wife from
London.</P>
<P>This was the substance of our first
day's conversation, the pleasantest day
that ever past over my head, and gave
me the truest satisfaction. He came
every day after this, and spent great
part of his time with me, and carried
me about to several of his friends
houses, where I was entertained with
great respect; also I dined several times
at his own house, when he took care
always to have his father so out of
the way, that I never saw him, or he
me.</P>
<P>A few days after, he brought the
writings, and a lawyer; and I signed
them, and delivered them to him with
many kisses. The next day he brought
me an obligation under his hand and
seal, whereby he engaged himself to
manage the plantation for my account,
and to remit the produce to my order,
wherever I should be, and withal, to be
obliged himself to make up the pro∣duce
a hundred pounds a year to me.
When he had done so, he told me, I
had a right to the produce of the cur∣rent
<PB N="274" REF="282"/>
year; and he paid me an hundred
pounds in Spanish pieces of eight, and
desired me to give him a receipt in full
for that year, ending at Christmas fol∣lowing.</P>
<P>I stayed here above five weeks, and
indeed had much ado to get away then.
Nay, he would have come over the Bay
with me, but I would by no means al∣low
him to do it; however, he would
send me over in a sloop of his own,
which was built like a yacht, and served
him as well for pleasure as business.
This I accepted of; and after the ut∣most
expressions both of duty and af∣fection,
we parted, and in a few days I
arrived safe at home, to the joy and sa∣tisfaction
of Mr. Carrol, my husband.</P>
<P>We went on with our plantation, and
managed it with great success; for hav∣ing
a flourishing stock to begin with,
and this being now encreased, we in∣larged
our number of servants, built us
a very good house, and cured every year
a great deal of land.</P>
<P>In a word, we were now in ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
considerable circumstances, and every
year encreasing; for our plantation grew

upon our hands insensibly, that the pro∣duce
was, at least, three hundred pounds
sterling a year; I mean worth so much
in England.</P>
<P>After I had been a year at home
again, I went over the Bay to see my son,
and to receive another year's income of
my plantation; and I was surprised to
hear, from my son, that his father was
dead, and had not been buried above a
fortnight. This, I confess, was not
disagreeable news, because now I could
appear, as I was, in a married condi∣tion;
so I told my son before I came
from him, that I believed I should mar∣ry
a gentleman who had a plantation
near mine. My son, the same dutiful
obliging creature as ever, treated me
now at his own house, paid me my hun∣dred
pounds, and sent me home again
loaded with presents.</P>
<P>Some time after this, I acquainted my
son I was married, and invited him o∣ver
to see us; and my husband wrote a
very obliging letter to him also, inviting
him to come; and he came accordingly
some months after.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="284"/>
It must be observed, that when Mr.
Bennet was dead, I gave Mr. Carrol an
account of that affair, and of this ne∣phew,
as I had called him, being
my own son, by that mistaken unhappy
match: He was perfectly easy, and told
me he should have been so if he had
been still alive; for, said he, it was
no fault of your's, nor of his; it was a
mistake impossible to be prevented. He
only reproached him with desiring me to
conceal it, and to live with him as a
wife, after he knew that I was his sister;
that, he said, was a vile part. Thus all
these difficulties were made easy, and we
lived together with the greatest kindness
and comfort imaginable.</P>
<P>My husband, after living here above
eight years, having acquired a hand∣some
fortune, had an opportunity of
disposing of the plantation to an advan∣tage;
and he being desirous of seeing
once more his native country, he sold
the estate, and having accumulated the
sum of ten thousand pounds, we took
shipping at Saint James-Town, and after
a pleasant voyage we safely arrived at
<PB N="277" REF="285"/>
Kingsale in Ireland, and went from thence
to the city of Gallway, the place of my
husband's birth.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Carrol purchased a free∣hold
estate of four hundred pounds per
annum, and we lived happily together
for two years, after we came to Gallway,
when it pleased the irreversible decree
of the Almighty to take my husband
to himself, and I became a widow again.
Being now in the decline of life, I se∣riously
reflect on my past follies, and
hope by a true repentance I shall obtain
favour with my incensed God, who hath
permitted me to run through a long
series of vice, which have brought me
to a due sense of my manifold omissions
in the duties of religion, which, until
lately, I have utterly neglected. Thus
I pass my days in resignation to the
will and pleasure of my heavenly father,
and finding nature daily to decay, and
believing I am not long for this world,
do make this my last will and testament
in the form and manner following.</P>
<P>I Laetitia Atkins, otherwise widow of
the late James Carrol, of the city of
<PB N="278" REF="286"/>
Gallway, in the county of Gallway,
being in perfect memory, through the
mercy of God, do make this my last
will and testament, in manner follow∣ing;
that is to say, I give to my de∣ceased
husband's brother, Charles Car∣rol,
all my real estate, lying about
Athlone, in the counties of Roscom∣mon
and Westmeath, and to his heirs
and assigns for ever.</P>
<P>Item, I give to Henry Kelly, my
gardener, the sum of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Item, I give John Ryan, my foot∣man,
the sum of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Item, I give to Jane Burke, my cham∣bermaid,
the sum of forty pounds.</P>
<P>Item, I give to Catherine O'Neal, my
Cook-maid, the sum of thirty pounds.</P>
<P>Item, I give to Dorothy Macna∣mara,
my house-maid, the sum of twen∣ty
pounds.</P>
<P>To my deceased husband's brother,
William Carrol, I give all the rest of
my goods and Chattles, and personal
estate whatsoever; but out of the same
to be decently interred, and all my fu∣neral
<PB N="279" REF="287"/>
charges to be paid, by the said
William Carrol.</P>
<P>Lastly, I make and constitute my
aforesaid brother-in-law, Charles Car∣rol,
executor of this my last will and
testiment, written with my own hand
this thirtieth day of March, in the year
of our Lord, one thousand seven hun∣dred
and twenty-two.</P>

this pious disposition for her latter end
she continued until the tenth day of De∣cember
