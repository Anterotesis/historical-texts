<P>THE Substance of the following Dissertation was
delivered by the Author in the Course of his
Lectures on Rhetorick and Belles-Lettres, in the Univer∣sity
of Edinburgh. At the Desire of several of his
Hearers, he has enlarged, and given it to the Publick, in
its present Form.</P>
<P>In this Dissertation, it is proposed, to make some Ob∣servations
on the ancient Poetry of Nations, particularly
the Runic and the Celtic; to point out those Characters of
Antiquity, which the Works of Ossian bear; to give an
Idea of the Spirit and Strain of his Poetry; and after ap∣plying
the Rules of Criticism to Fingal, as an Epic
Poem, to examine the Merit of Ossian's Compositions in
general, with Regard to Description, Imagery, and
Sentiment.</P>

<HEAD>A
CRITICAL DISSERTATION
ON THE
POEMS OF OSSIAN,
THE
SON OF FINGAL.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the monuments remaining of the ancient state of
nations, few are more valuable than their poems or songs.
History, when it treats of remote and dark ages, is seldom
very instructive. The beginnings of society, in every country, are
involved in fabulous confusion; and though they were not, they
would furnish few events worth recording. But, in every period of
society, human manners are a curious spectacle; and the most natural
pictures of ancient manners are exhibited in the ancient poems of
nations. These present to us, what is much more valuable than the
history of such transactions as a rude age can afford, The history of
human imagination and passion. They make us acquainted with
the notions and feelings of our fellow-creatures in the most artless
ages; discovering what objects they admired, and what pleasures
they pursued, before those refinements of society had taken place,
which enlarge indeed, and diversify the transactions, but disguise
the manners of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="4"/>
Besides this merit, which ancient poems have with philosophical
observers of human nature, they have another with persons of taste.
They promise some of the highest beauties of poetical writing. Ir∣regular
and unpolished we may expect the productions of unculti∣vated
ages to be; but abounding, at the same time, with that en∣thusiasm,
that vehemence and fire, which are the soul of poetry.
For many circumstances of those times which we call barbarous, are
favourable to the poetical spirit. That state, in which human nature
shoots wild and free, though unfit for other improvements, certainly
encourages the high exertions of fancy and passion.</P>
<P>In the infancy of societies, men live scattered and dispersed, in the
midst of solitary rural scenes, where the beauties of nature are their
chief entertainment. They meet with many objects, to them new
and strange; their wonder and surprize are frequently excited; and
by the sudden changes of fortune occurring in their unsettled state
of life, their passions are raised to the utmost. Their passions have
nothing to restrain them: their imagination has nothing to check it.
They display themselves to one another without disguise; and con∣verse
and act in the uncovered simplicity of nature. As their feelings
are strong, so their language, of itself, assumes a poetical turn.
Prone to exaggerate, they describe every thing in the strongest co∣lours;
which of course renders their speech picturesque and figura∣tive.
Figurative language owes its rise chiefly to two causes; to the
want of proper names for objects, and to the influence of imagina∣tion
and passion over the form of expression. Both these causes con∣curr
in the infancy of society. Figures are commonly considered as
artificial modes of speech, devised by orators and poets, after the
world had advanced to a refined state. The contrary of this is the
truth. Men never have used so many figures of style, as in those
rude ages, when, besides the power of a warm imagination to sug∣gest
lively images, the want of proper and precise terms for the ideas
they would express, obliged them to have recourse to circumlocu∣tion,
metaphor, comparison, and all those substituted forms of ex∣pression,
which give a poetical air to language. An American
chief, at this day, harangues at the head of his tribe, in a more
bold metaphorical style, than a modern European would adventure
to use in an Epic poem.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
In the progress of society, the genius and manners of men un∣dergo
a change more favourable to accuracy than to sprightliness and
sublimity. As the world advances, the understanding gains ground
upon the imagination; the understanding is more exercised; the
imagination, less. Fewer objects occur that are new or surprizing.
Men apply themselves to trace the causes of things; they correct
and refine one another; they subdue or disguise their passions; they
form their exterior manners upon one uniform standard of politeness
and civility. Human nature is pruned according to method and
rule. Language advances from sterility to copiousness, and at the
same time, from fervour and enthusiasm, to correctness and preci∣sion.
Style becomes more chaste; but less animated. The progress
of the world in this respect resembles the progress of age in man.
The powers of imagination are most vigorous and predominant in
youth; those of the understanding ripen more slowly, and often at∣tain
not their maturity, till the imagination begin to flag. Hence,
poetry, which is the child of imagination, is frequently most glow∣ing
and animated in the first ages of society. As the ideas of our
youth are remembered with a peculiar pleasure on account of their
liveliness and vivacity; so the most ancient poems have often proved
the greatest favourites of nations.</P>
<P>Poetry has been said to be more ancient than prose: and how∣ever
paradoxical such an assertion may seem, yet, in a qualified
sense, it is true. Men certainly never conversed with one another
in regular numbers; but even their ordinary language would in
ancient times, for the reasons before assigned, approach to a poeti∣cal
style; and the first compositions transmitted to posterity, beyond
doubt, were, in a literal sense, poems; that is, compositions in
which imagination had the chief hand, formed into some kind
of numbers, and pronounced with a musical modulation or tone.
Musick or song has been found coaeval with society among the
most barbarous nations. The only subjects which could prompt
men, in their first rude state, to utter their thoughts in composi∣tions
of any length, were such as naturally assumed the tone of
poetry; praises of their gods, or of their ancestors; commemora∣tions
of their own warlike exploits; or lamentations over their mis∣fortunes.
And before writing was invented, no other compositions,
except songs or poems, could take such hold of the imagination and
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
memory, as to be preserved by oral tradition, and handed down
from one race to another.</P>
<P>Hence we may expect to find poems among the antiquities of all
nations. It is probable too, that an extensive search would discover
a certain degree of resemblance among all the most ancient poetical
productions, from whatever country they have proceeded. In a
similar state of manners, similar objects and passions operating upon
the imaginations of men, will stamp their productions with the
same general character. Some diversity will, no doubt, be occa∣sioned
by climate and genius. But mankind never bear such re∣sembling
features, as they do in the beginnings of society. Its
subsequent revolutions give rise to the principal distinctions among
nations; and divert, into channels widely separated, that current of
human genius and manners, which descends originally from one
spring. What we have been long accustomed to call the oriental
vein of poetry, because some of the earliest poetical productions
have come to us from the East, is probably no more oriental than
occidental; it is characteristical of an age rather than a country; and
belongs, in some measure, to all nations at a certain period. Of
this the works of Ossian seem to furnish a remarkable proof.</P>
<P>Our present subject leads us to investigate the ancient poetical
remains, not so much of the east, or of the Greeks and Romans,
as of the northern nations; in order to discover whether the Gothic
poetry has any resemblance to the Celtic or Galic, which we are
about to consider. Though the Goths, under which name we
usually comprehend all the Scandinavian tribes, were a people alto∣gether
fierce and martial, and noted, to a proverb, for their igno∣rance
of the liberal arts, yet they too, from the earliest times, had
their poets and their songs. Their poets were distinguished by the
title of <HI>Scalders,</HI> and their songs were termed <HI>Vyses.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Olaus Wormius, in the appendix to his Treatise de Literatura Runica, has given a particular account of the Gothic poetry, commonly called, Runic, from <HI>Runes,</HI> which signifies the Gothic letters. He informs us that there were no sewer than 136 different heads of measure or verse used in their <HI>Vyses;</HI> and though we are accustomed to call rhyme a Gothic invention, he says expresly, that among all these measures, rhyme, or correspon∣dence of final syllables, was never em∣ployed. He analyses the structure of one of these kinds of verse, that in which the poem of Lodbrog, afterwards quoted, is written; which exhibits a very singular species of harmony, if it can be allowed that name, depending neither upon rhyme nor upon metrical feet, or quantity of syllables, but chiefly upon the number of the syllables, and the disposition of the let∣ters▪ In every stanza was an equal number of lines: in every line six syll∣bles. In each distich▪ it was requisite that three words should begin with the same letter; two of the corresponding words placed in the first line of the dis∣tich, the third, in the second line. In each line were also required two syllables, but never the final ones, formed either of the same consonants, or same vowels. As an example of this measure, Olaus gives us these two Latin lines, constructed exactly according to the above rules of Runic verse;
<Q><L>Christus caput nostrum</L>
<L>Coronet te bonis.</L></Q>
The initial letters of Christus, Caput and Coronet, make the three correspond∣ing letters of the distich. In the first line, the first syllables of Christus and of nostrum; in the second line, the <HI>on</HI> in coronet and in bonis make the requisite correspondence of syllables. Frequent in∣versions and transpositions were permitted in this poetry; which would naturally follow from such laborious attention to the collocation of words.</P>
<P>The curious on this subject may con∣sult likewise Dr. Hicks's Thesaurus Lin∣guarum Septentrionalium; particularly the 23d chapter of his Grammatica Anglo Saxonica &amp; Maeso Gothica; where they will find a full account of the struc∣ture of the Anglo-Saxon verse, which nearly resembled the Gothic. They will find also some specimens both of Gothic and Saxon poetry. An extract, which Dr. Hicks has given from the work of one of the Danish Scalders, entitled, Hervarer Saga, containing an evocation from the dead, may be found in the 6th volume of Mis∣cellany Poems, published by Mr. Dry∣den.</P></NOTE> Saxo Gram∣maticus,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
a Danish Historian of considerable note, who flourished in
the thirteenth century, informs us that very many of these songs,
containing the ancient traditionary stories of the country, were found
engraven upon rocks in the old Runic character; several of which
he has translated into Latin, and inserted into his History. But his
versions are plainly so paraphrastical, and forced into such an imita∣tion
of the style and the measures of the Roman poets, that one
can form no judgment from them of the native spirit of the ori∣ginal.
A more curious monument of the true Gothic poetry is
preserved by Olaus Wormius in his book de Literatura Runica. It
is an Epicedium, or funeral song, composed by Regner Lodbrog;
and translated by Olaus, word for word, from the original. This
Lodbrog was a king of Denmark, who lived in the eighth century,
famous for his wars and victories; and at the same time an emi∣nent
<HI>Scalder</HI> or poet. It was his misfortune to fall at last into the
hands of one of his enemies, by whom he was thrown into prison,
and condemned to be destroyed by serpents. In this situation he
solaced himself with rehearsing all the exploits of his life. The
poem is divided into twenty-nine stanzas, of ten lines each; and
every stanza begins with these words, Pugnavimus Ensibus, We
have fought with our swords. Olaus's version is in many places so
obscure as to be hardly intelligible. I have subjoined the whole be∣low,
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
exactly as he has published it; and shall translate as much as
may give the English reader an idea of the spirit and strain of this
kind of poetry.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LG N="1">

<P>“We have fought with our swords.—I was young, when, to∣wards
the east, in the bay of Oreon, we made torrents of blood
flow, to gorge the ravenous beast of prey, and the yellow-footed
bird. There resounded the hard steel upon the lofty hel∣mets
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
of men. The whole ocean was one wound. The crow
waded in the blood of the slain. When we had numbered
twenty years, we lifted our spears on high, and every where
spread our renown. Eight barons we overcame in the east, be∣fore
the port of Diminum; and plentifully we feasted the eagle
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
in that slaughter. The warm stream of wounds ran into the
ocean. The army fell before us. When we steered our ships
into the mouth of the Vistula, we sent the Helsingians to the
Hall of Odin. Then did the sword bite. The waters were all
one wound. The earth was dyed red with the warm stream.
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
The sword rung upon the coats of mail, and clove the bucklers
in twain. None fled on that day, till among his ships Heraudus
fell. Than him no braver baron cleaves the sea with ships; a
chearful heart did he ever bring to the combat. Then the host
threw away their shields, when the uplifted spear flew at the
breasts of heroes. The sword bit the Scarfian rocks; bloody
was the shield in battle, until Rafno the king was slain. From
the heads of warriors the warm sweat streamed down their ar∣mour.
The crows around the Indirian islands had an ample
prey. It were difficult to single out one among so many deaths.
At the rising of the sun I beheld the spears piercing the bodies of
foes, and the bows throwing forth their steel-pointed arrows.
Loud roared the swords in the plains of Lano.—The virgin long
bewailed the slaughter of that morning.”—In this strain the poet
continues to describe several other military exploits. The images
are not much varied; the noise of arms, the streaming of blood, and
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
the feasting the birds of prey, often recurring. He mentions the death
of two of his sons in battle; and the lamentation he describes as made
for one of them is very singular. A Grecian or Roman poet would
have introduced the virgins or nymphs of the wood, bewailing the un∣timely
fall of a young hero. But, says our Gothic poet, “when
Rogvaldus was slain, for him mourned all the hawks of heaven,”
as lamenting a benefactor who had so liberally supplied them with
prey; “for boldly,” as he adds, “in the strife of swords, did the
breaker of helmets throw the spear of blood.”</P>
<P>The poem concludes with sentiments of the highest bravery and
contempt of death. “What is more certain to the brave man than
death, though amidst the storm of swords, he stand always ready
to oppose it? He only regrets this life who hath never known
distress. The timorous man allures the devouring eagle to the
field of battle. The coward, wherever he comes, is useless to him∣self.
This I esteem honourable, that the youth should advance to
the combat fairly matched one against another; nor man retreat
from man. Long was this the warrior's highest glory. He who
aspires to the love of virgins, ought always to be foremost in the roar
of arms. It appears to me of truth, that we are led by the Fates.
Seldom can any overcome the appointment of destiny. Little did
I foresee that Ella<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the name of his enemy who had condemned him to death.</NOTE> was to have my life in his hands, in that day
when fainting I concealed my blood, and pushed forth my ships into
the waves; after we had spread a repast for the beasts of prey
throughout the Scottish bays. But this makes me always rejoice
that in the halls of our father Balder [or Odin] I know there are
seats prepared, where, in a short time, we shall be drinking ale
out of the hollow skulls of our enemies. In the house of the
mighty Odin, no brave man laments death. I come not with the
voice of despair to Odin's hall. How eagerly would all the sons
of Aslauga now rush to war, did they know the distress of their
father, whom a multitude of venomous serpents tear! I have given
to my children a mother who hath filled their hearts with valour.
I am fast approaching to my end. A cruel death awaits me from
the viper's bite. A snake dwells in the midst of my heart. I
hope that the sword of some of my sons shall yet be stained with
the blood of Ella. The valiant youths will wax red with anger,
and will not sit in peace. Fifty and one times have I reared the
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
standard in battle. In my youth I learned to dye the sword in
blood: my hope was then, that no king among men would be
more renowned than me. The goddesses of death will now
soon call me; I must not mourn my death. Now I end my
song. The goddesses invite me away; they whom Odin has sent
to me from his hall. I will sit upon a lofty seat, and drink ale
joyfully with the goddesses of death. The hours of my life are
run out. I will smile when I die.”</P>
<P>This is such poetry as we might expect from a barbarous nation.
It breathes a most ferocious spirit. It is wild, harsh and irregular;
but at the same time animated and strong; the style, in the original,
full of inversions, and, as we learn from some of Olaus's notes,
highly metaphorical and figured.</P>
<P>But when we open the works of Ossian, a very different scene
presents itself. There we find the fire and the enthusiasm of the
most early times, combined with an amazing degree of regularity
and art. We find tenderness, and even delicacy of sentiment, greatly
predominant over fierceness and barbarity. Our hearts are melted
with the softest feelings, and at the same time elevated with the
highest ideas of magnanimity, generosity, and true heroism. When
we turn from the poetry of Lodbrog to that of Ossian, it is like
passing from a savage desart, into a fertile and cultivated country.
How is this to be accounted for? Or by what means to be recon∣ciled
with the remote antiquity attributed to these poems? This is a
curious point; and requires to be illustrated.</P>
<P>That the ancient Scots were of Celtic original, is past all doubt.
Their conformity with the Celtic nations in language, manners and
religion, proves it to a full demonstration. The Celtae, a great
and mighty people, altogether distinct from the Goths and Teu∣tones,
once extended their dominion over all the west of Europe;
but seem to have had their most full and compleat establishment in
Gaul. Wherever the Celtae or Gauls are mentioned by ancient wri∣ters,
we seldom fail to hear of their Druids and their Bards; the in∣stitution
of which two orders, was the capital distinction of their man∣ners
and policy. The Druids were their philosophers and priests;
the Bards, their poets and recorders of heroic actions: And both
these orders of men, seem to have subsisted among them, as chief
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
members of the state, from time immemorial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Strabo. lib. 4.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Diodor. Sicul. l. 5.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Posidonius ap. Athenaeum, l. 6.</P></NOTE>. We must not
therefore imagine the Celtae to have been altogether a gross and rude
nation. They possessed from very remote ages a formed system of
discipline and manners, which appears to have had a deep and last∣ing
influence. Ammianus Marcellinus gives them this express testi∣mony,
that there flourished among them the study of the most laud∣able
arts; introduced by the Bards, whose office it was to sing in
heroic verse, the gallant actions of illustrious men; and by the
Druids, who lived together in colleges or societies, after the Pythago∣rean
manner, and philosophizing upon the highest subjects, asserted
the immortality of the human soul<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Per haec loca (speaking of Gaul) hominibus paulatim excultis, <HI>viguere stu∣dia laudabilium doctrinarum;</HI> inchoata per Bardos &amp; Euhages &amp; Druidas. Et Bardi quidem fortia virorum illustrium facta heroicis composita versibus cum dul∣cibus lyrae modulis cantitarunt. Euhages vero scrutantes seriem &amp; sublimia naturae pandere conabantur. Inter hos, Druidae ingeniis celsiores, ut auctoritas Pythagorae decrevit, sodalitiis adstricti consortiis, quaes∣tionibus altarum occultarumque rerum erecti sunt; &amp; despectantes humana pro∣nuntiarunt animas immortales. Amm. Marcellinus, l. 15. cap. 9.</NOTE>. Though Julius Caesar in his
account of Gaul, does not expresly mention the Bards, yet it is plain
that under the title of Druids, he comprehends that whole college
or order; of which the Bards, who, it is probable, were the dis∣ciples
of the Druids, undoubtedly made a part. It deserves remark,
that according to his account, the Druidical institution first took rise
in Britain, and passed from thence into Gaul; so that they who as∣pired
to be thorough masters of that learning were wont to resort to
Britain. He adds too, that such as were to be initiated among the
Druids, were obliged to commit to their memory a great number of
verses, insomuch that some employed twenty years in this course of
education; and that they did not think it lawful to record these
poems in writing, but sacredly handed them down by tradition from
race to race<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vid. Caesar de bello Gall. lib. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So strong was the attachment of the Celtic nations to their poetry
and their Bards, that amidst all the changes of their government and
manners, even long after the order of the Druids was extinct,
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
and the national religion altered, the Bards continued to flourish;
not as a set of strolling songsters, like the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Rhapso∣dists,
in Homer's time, but as an order of men highly respected in
the state, and supported by a publick establishment. We find
them, according to the testimonies of Strabo and Diodorus, before
the age of Augustus Caesar; and we find them remaining under the
same name, and exercising the same functions as of old, in Ireland,
and in the north of Scotland, almost down to our own times. It is
well known that in both these countries, every <HI>Regulus</HI> or chief had
his own Bard, who was considered as an officer of rank in his court;
and had lands assigned him, which descended to his family. Of the
honour in which the Bards were held, many instances occur in
Ossian's poems. On all important occasions, they were the ambassa∣dors
between contending chiefs; and their persons were held sacred.
“Cairbar feared to stretch his sword to the bards, though his soul
was dark.—Loose the bards, said his brother Cathmor, they are
the sons of other times. Their voice shall be heard in other ages,
when the kings of Temora have failed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 188.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>From all this, the Celtic tribes clearly appear to have been ad∣dicted
in so high a degree to poetry, and to have made it so much
their study from the earliest times, as may remove our wonder at
meeting with a vein of higher poetical refinement among them, than
was at first sight to have been expected among nations, whom we
are accustomed to call barbarous. Barbarity, I must observe, is a
very equivocal term; it admits of many different forms and degrees;
and though, in all of them, it exclude polished manners, it is, how∣ever,
not inconsistent with generous sentiments and tender affec∣tions<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Surely among the wild Laplanders, if any where, barbarity is in its most per∣fect state. Yet their love songs which Scheffer has given us in his Lapponia, are a proof that natural tenderness of sentiment may be found in a country, into which the least glimmering of science has never pe∣netrated. To most English readers these songs are well known by the clegant translations of them in the Spectator, No. 366 and 406. I shall subjoin Scheffer's Latin version of one of them, which has the appearance of being strictly literal.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
be found to prevail in a rude state of society, no one can say.
Astonishing instances of them we know, from history, have some∣times
appeared: and a few characters distinguished by those high
qualities, might lay a foundation for a set of manners being intro∣duced
into the songs of the Bards, more refined, it is probable, and
exalted, according to the usual poetical licence, than the real manners
of the country. In particular, with respect to heroism; the great
employment of the Celtic bards, was to delineate the characters,
and sing the praises of heroes. So Lucan;
<Q><L>Vos quoque qui fortes animos, belloque peremptos,</L>
<L>Laudibus in longum vates diffunditis aevum</L>
<L>Plurima securi fudistis carmina Bardi.</L>
<BIBL>Phars. <HI>l.</HI> 1.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Now when we consider a college or order of men, who, cultivating
poetry throughout a long series of ages, had their imaginations con∣tinually
employed on the ideas of heroism; who had all the poems
and panegyricks, which were composed by their predecessors, handed
down to them with care; who rivalled and endeavoured to outstrip
those who had gone before them, each in the celebration of his
particular hero; is it not natural to think, that at length the cha∣racter
of a hero would appear in their songs with the highest lustre,
and be adorned with qualities truly noble? Some of the qualities
indeed which distinguish a Fingal, moderation, humanity, and cle∣mency,
would not probably be the first ideas of heroism occurring
to a barbarous people: But no sooner had such ideas begun to dawn
on the minds of poets, than, as the human mind easily opens to the
native representations of human perfection, they would be seized and
embraced; they would enter into their panegyricks; they would af∣ford
materials for succeeding bards to work upon, and improve;
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
they would contribute not a little to exalt the publick manners.
For such songs as these, familiar to the Celtic warriors from their
childhood, and throughout their whole life, both in war and in
peace, their principal entertainment, must have had a very consi∣derable
influence in propagating among them real manners nearly
approaching to the poetical; and in forming even such a hero as
Fingal. Especially when we consider that among their limited
objects of ambition, among the few advantages which in a savage
state, man could obtain over man, the chief was Fame, and that Im∣mortality
which they expected to receive from their virtues and ex∣ploits,
in the songs of bards<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When Edward l. conquered Wales, he put to death all the Welch bards. This cruel policy plainly shews, how great an influence he imagined the songs of these bards to have over the minds of the people; and of what nature he judged that influence to be. The Welch bards were of the same Celtic race with the Scottish and Irish.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having made these remarks on the Celtic poetry and Bards in ge∣neral,
I shall next consider the particular advantages which Ossian
possessed. He appears clearly to have lived in a period which en∣joyed
all the benefit I just now mentioned of traditionary poetry.
The exploits of Trathal, Trenmor, and the other ancestors of Fin∣gal,
are spoken of as familiarly known. Ancient bards are frequently
alluded to. In one remarkable passage, Ossian describes himself as
living in a sort of classical age, enlightened by the memorials of for∣mer
times, conveyed in the songs of bards; and points at a period
of darkness and ignorance which lay beyond the reach of tradition.
“His words,” says he, “came only by halves to our ears; they
were dark as the tales of other times, before the light of the song
arose<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE>.” Ossian, himself, appears to have been endowed by na∣ture
with an exquisite sensibility of heart; prone to that tender me∣lancholy
which is so often an attendant on great genius; and sus∣ceptible
equally of strong and of soft emotions. He was not only a
professed bard, educated with care, as we may easily believe, to all
the poetical art then known, and connected, as he shews us himself,
in intimate friendship with the other contemporary bards, but a war∣rior
also; and the son of the most renowned hero and prince of his
age. This formed a conjunction of circumstances, uncommonly fa∣vourable
towards exalting the imagination of a poet. He relates ex∣peditions
in which he had been engaged; he sings of battles in
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
which he had fought and overcome; he had beheld the most illus∣trious
scenes which that age could exhibit, both of heroism in war,
and magnificence in peace. For however rude the magnificence
of those times may seem to us, we must remember that all ideas of
magnificence are comparative; and that the age of Fingal was an
aera of distinguished splendor in that part of the world. Fingal
reigned over a considerable territory; he was enriched with the
spoils of the Roman province; he was ennobled by his victories and
great actions; and was in all respects a personage of much higher
dignity than any of the chieftains, or heads of Clans, who lived in the
same country, after a more extensive monarchy was established.</P>
<P>The manners of Ossian's age, so far as we can gather them from
his writings, were abundantly favourable to a poetical genius. The
two dispiriting vices, to which Longinus imputes the decline of
poetry, covetousness and effeminacy, were as yet unknown. The
cares of men were few. They lived a roving indolent life; hunting
and war their principal employments; and their chief amusements,
the musick of bards and “the feast of shells.” The great object pur∣sued
by heroic spirits, was “to receive their fame,” that is, to become
worthy of being celebrated in the songs of bards; and “to have
their name on the four gray stones.” To die, unlamented by a
bard, was deemed so great a misfortune, as even to disturb their
ghosts in another state. After death, they expected to follow em∣ployments
of the same nature with those which had amused them on
earth; to fly with their friends on clouds, to pursue airy deer, and
to listen to their praise in the mouths of bards. In such times as
these, in a country where poetry had been so long cultivated, and so
highly honoured, is it any wonder that among the race and succession
of bards, one Homer should arise; a man who, endowed with a na∣tural
happy genius, favoured by peculiar advantages of birth and
condition, and meeting in the course of his life, with a variety of
incidents proper to fire his imagination, and to touch his heart,
should attain a degree of eminence in poetry, worthy to draw the
admiration of more refined ages?</P>
<P>The compositions of Ossian are so strongly marked with charac∣ters
of antiquity, that although there were no external proof to sup∣port
that antiquity, hardly any reader of judgment and taste, could
hesitate in referring them to a very remote aera. There are four
great stages through which men successively pass in the progress of
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
society. The first and earliest is the life of hunters; pasturage suc∣ceeds
to this, as the ideas of property begin to take root; next, agri∣culture;
and lastly, commerce. Throughout Ossian's poems, we
plainly find ourselves in the first of these periods of society; during
which, hunting was the chief employment of men, and the principal
method of their procuring subsistence. Pasturage was not indeed
wholly unknown; for we hear of dividing the herd in the case of a
divorce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 31.</NOTE>; but the allusions to herds and to cattle are not many; and
of agriculture, we find no traces. No cities appear to have been built
in the territories of Fingal. No art is mentioned except that of work∣ing
in iron. Every thing presents to us the most simple and un∣improved
manners. At their feasts, the heroes prepared their own
repast; they sat round the light of the burning oak; the wind lifted
their locks, and whistled through their open halls. Whatever was
beyond the necessaries of life was known to them only as the spoil of
the Roman province; “the gold of the stranger; the lights of the
stranger; the steeds of the stranger, the children of the rein<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The chariot of Cuchullin has been thought by some to be represented as more magnificent than is consistent with the po∣verty of that age; in Book I. of Fingal. But this chariot is plainly only a horse∣litter; and the gems mentioned in the de∣scription, are no other than the shining stones or pebbles, known to be frequently found along the western coast of Scotland.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>This representation of Ossian's times, must strike us the more, as
genuine and authentick, when it is compared with a poem of later
date, which Mr. Macpherson has preserved in one of his notes. It
is that wherein five bards are represented as passing the evening in the
house of a chief, and each of them separately giving his description
of the night<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 253.</NOTE>. The night scenery is beautiful; and the author has
plainly imitated the style and manner of Ossian: But he has allowed
some images to appear which betray a later period of society. For
we meet with windows clapping, the herds of goats and cows seek∣ing
shelter, the shepherd wandering, corn on the plain, and the
wakeful hind rebuilding the shocks of corn which had been over∣turned
by the tempest. Whereas in Ossian's works, from beginning
to end, all is consistent; no modern allusion drops from him; but
every where, the same face of rude nature appears; a country
wholly uncultivated, thinly inhabited, and recently peopled. The
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
grass of the rock, the flower of the health, the thistle with its
beard, are the chief ornaments of his landscapes. “The desart,”
says Fingal, “is enough to me, with all its woods and deer.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 78.</NOTE></P>
<P>The circle of ideas and transactions, is no wider than suits such
an age: Nor any greater diversity introduced into characters, than
the events of that period would naturally display. Valour and bo∣dily
strength are the admired qualities. Contentions arise, as is
usual among savage nations, from the slightest causes. To be af∣fronted
at a tournament, or to be omitted in the invitation to a
feast, kindles a war. Women are often carried away by force;
and the whole tribe, as in the Homeric times, rise to avenge the
wrong. The heroes show refinement of sentiment indeed on seve∣ral
occasions, but none of manners. They speak of their past ac∣tions
with freedom, boast of their exploits, and sing their own
praise. In their battles, it is evident that drums, trumpets or bag-pipes,
were not known or used. They had no expedient for giving
the military alarms but striking a shield, or raising a loud cry: And
hence the loud and terrible voice of Fingal is often mentioned, as a
necessary qualification of a great general; like the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
of Homer. Of military discipline or skill, they appear to have been
entirely destitute. Their armies seem not to have been numerous;
their battles were disorderly; and terminated, for the most part, by a
personal combat, or wrestling of the two chiefs; after which, “the
bard sung the song of peace, and the battle ceased along the
field<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 140.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The manner of composition bears all the marks of the greatest
antiquity. No artful transitions; nor full and extended connection
of parts; such as we find among the poets of later times, when or∣der
and regularity of composition were more studied and known;
but a style always rapid and vehement; in narration concise, even
to abruptness, and leaving several circumstances to be supplied by
the reader's imagination. The language has all that figurative cast,
which, as I before shewed, partly a glowing and undisciplined ima∣gination,
partly the sterility of language, and the want of proper
terms, have always introduced into the early speech of nations; and
in several respects, it carries a remarkable resemblance to the style
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
of the Old Testament. It deserves particular notice, as one of the
most genuine and decisive characters of antiquity, that very few ge∣neral
terms or abstract ideas, are to be met with in the whole col∣lection
of Ossian's works. The ideas of men at first, were all par∣ticular.
They had not words to express general conceptions.
These were the consequence of more profound reflection, and lon∣ger
acquaintance with the arts of thought and of speech. Ossian,
accordingly, almost never expresses himself in the abstract. His
ideas extended little farther than to the objects he saw around him.
A publick, a community, the universe, were conceptions beyond
his sphere. Even a mountain, a sea, or a lake, which he has oc∣casion
to mention, though only in a simile, are for the most part
particularized; it is the hill of Cromla, the storm of the sea of Mal∣mor,
or the reeds of the lake of Lego. A modo of expression,
which whilst it is characteristical of antient ages, is at the same time
highly favourable to descriptive poetry. For the same reasons, per∣sonification
is a poetical figure not very common with Ossian. In∣animate
objects, such as winds, trees, flowers, he sometimes per∣sonifies
with great beauty. But the personifications which are so
familiar to later poets of Fame, Time, Terror, Virtue, and the rest of
that class, were unknown to our Celtic bard. These were modes of
conception too abstract for his age.</P>
<P>All these are marks so undoubted, and some of them too, so nice
and delicate, of the most early times, as put the high antiquity of
these poems out of question. Especially when we consider, that if
there had been any imposture in this case, it must have been con∣trived
and executed in the Highlands of Scotland, two or three cen∣turies
ago; as up to this period, both by manuscripts, and by the
testimony of a multitude of living witnesses, concerning the uncon∣trovertible
tradition of these poems, they can clearly be traced.
Now this is a period when that country enjoyed no advantages for a
composition of this kind, which it may not be supposed to have en∣joyed
in as great, if not in a greater degree, a thousand years before.
To suppose that two or three hundred years ago, when we well
know the Highlands to have been in a state of gross ignorance and
barbarity, there should have arisen in that country a poet, of such
exquisite genius, and of such deep knowledge of mankind, and of
history, as to divest himself of the ideas and manners of his own
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
age, and to give us a just and natural picture of a state of society
ancienter by a thousand years; one who could support this counter∣feited
antiquity through such a large collection of poems, without
the least inconsistency; and who possessed of all this genius and art,
had at the same time the self-denial of concealing himself, and of
ascribing his own works to an antiquated bard, without the impos∣ture
being detected; is a supposition that transcends all bounds of
credibility.</P>
<P>There are, besides, two other circumstances to be attended to,
still of greater weight, if possible, against this hypothesis. One is,
the total absence of religious ideas from this work; for which the
translator has, in his preface, given a very probable account, on the
footing of its being the work of Ossian. The Druidical supersti∣tion
was, in the days of Ossian, on the point of its final extinction;
and for particular reasons, odious to the family of Fingal; whilst
the Christian faith was not yet established. But had it been the
work of one, to whom the ideas of christianity were familiar from
his infancy; and who had superadded to them also the bigotted su∣perstition
of a dark age and country; it is impossible but in some pas∣sage
or other, the traces of them would have appeared. The other
circumstance is, the entire silence which reigns with respect to all the
great clans or families, which are now established in the Highlands.
The origin of these several clans is known to be very ancient: And
it is as well known, that there is no passion by which a native High∣lander
is more distinguished, than by attachment to his clan, and jea∣lousy
for its honour. That a Highland bard, in forging a work re∣lating
to the antiquities of his country, should have inserted no cir∣cumstance
which pointed out the rise of his own clan, which ascer∣tained
its antiquity, or increased its glory, is of all suppositions that
can be formed, the most improbable; and the silence on this head,
amounts to a demonstration that the author lived before any of the
present great clans were formed or known.</P>
<P>Assuming it then, as well may, for certain, that the poems
now under consideration, are genuine venerable monuments of very
remote antiquity; I proceed to make some remarks upon their ge∣neral
spirit and strain. The two great characteristics of Ossian's
poetry are, tenderness and sublimity. It breathes nothing of the
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
gay and chearful kind; an air of solemnity and seriousness is diffused
over the whole. Ossian is perhaps the only poet who never re∣laxes,
or lets himself down into the light and amusing strain; which
I readily admit to be no small disadvantage to him, with the bulk of
readers. He moves perpetually in the high region of the grand and
the pathetick. One key note is struck at the beginning, and sup∣ported
to the end; nor is any ornament introduced, but what is per∣fectly
concordant with the general tone or melody. The events re∣corded,
are all serious and grave; the scenery throughout, wild and
romantic. The extended heath by the sea shore; the mountain
shaded with mist; the torrent rushing through a solitary valley; the
scattered oaks, and the tombs of warriors overgrown with moss; all
produce a solemn attention in the mind, and prepare it for great
and extraordinary events. We find not in Ossian, an imagination
that sports itself, and dresses out gay trifles to please the fancy.
His poetry, more perhaps than that of any other writer, deserves to
be stiled, <HI>The Poetry of the Heart.</HI> It is a heart penetrated with
noble sentiments, and with sublime and tender passions; a heart that
glows, and kindles the fancy; a heart that is full, and pours itself
forth. Ossian did not write, like modern poets, to please readers
and critics. He sung from the love of poetry and song. His de∣light
was to think of the heroes among whom he had flourished;
to recall the affecting incidents of his life; to dwell upon his past
wars and loves and friendships; till, as he expresses it himself, “the
light of his soul arose; the days of other years rose before him;”
and under this true poetic inspiration, giving vent to his genius, no
wonder we should so often hear, and acknowledge in his strains, the
powerful and ever-pleasing voice of nature.</P>
<Q><L>—Arte, natura potentior omni.—</L>
<L>Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo.</L></Q>
<P>It is necessary here to observe, that the beauties of Ossian's writings
cannot be felt by those who have given them only a single or a
hasty perusal. His manner is so different from that of the poets,
to whom we are most accustomed; his style is so concise, and so
much crowded with imagery; the mind is kept at such a stretch in
accompanying the author; that an ordinary reader is at first apt to
be dazzled and fatigued, rather than pleased. His poems require to
be taken up at intervals, and to be frequently reviewed; and then it
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
is impossible but his beauties must open to every reader who is capa∣ble
of sensibility. Those who have the highest degree of it, will re∣lish
them the most.</P>
<P>As Homer is of all the great poets, the one whose manner, and
whose times come the nearest to Ossian's, we are naturally led to run
a parallel in some instances between the Greek and the Celtic bard.
For though Homer lived more than a thousand years before Ossian,
it is not from the age of the world, but from the state of society, that
we are to judge of resembling times. The Greek has in several
points, a manifest superiority. He introduces a greater variety of in∣cidents;
he possesses a larger compass of ideas; has more diversity
in his characters; and a much deeper knowledge of human nature.
It was not to be expected, that in any of these particulars, Ossian
could equal Homer. For Homer lived in a country where society
was much farther advanced; he had beheld many more objects;
cities built and flourishing; laws instituted; order, discipline, and
arts begun. His field of observation was much larger and more
splendid; his knowledge, of course, more extensive; his mind
also, it shall be granted, more penetrating. But if Ossian's ideas
and objects be less diversified than those of Homer, they are all,
however, of the kind fittest for poetry: The bravery and generosity
of heroes, the tenderness of lovers, the attachments of friends, pa∣rents,
and children. In a rude age and country, though the events
that happen be few, the undissipated mind broods over them more;
they strike the imagination, and fire the passions in a higher degree;
and of consequence become happier materials to a poetical genius,
than the same events when scattered through the wide circle of more
varied action, and cultivated life.</P>
<P>Homer is a more chearful and sprightly poet than Ossian. You
discern in him all the Greek vivacity; whereas Ossian uniformly
maintains the gravity and solemnity of a Celtic hero. This too is in
a great measure to be accounted for from the different situations in
which they lived, partly personal, and partly national. Ossian had
survived all his friends, and was disposed to melancholy by the inci∣dents
of his life. But besides this, chearfulness is one of the many
blessings which we owe to formed society. The solitary wild state
is always a serious one. Bating the sudden and violent bursts of
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
mirth, which sometimes break forth at their dances and feasts; the
savage American tribes, have been noted by all travellers for their
gravity and taciturnity. Somewhat of this taciturnity may be also
remarked in Ossian. On all occasions he is frugal of his words;
and never gives you more of an image or a description, than is just
sufficient to place it before you in one clear point of view. It is a
blaze of lightning, which flashes and vanishes. Homer is more ex∣tended
in his descriptions; and fills them up with a greater variety
of circumstances. Both the poets are dramatick; that is, they in∣troduce
their personages frequently speaking before us. But Ossian
is concise and rapid in his speeches, as he is in every other thing.
Homer, with the Greek vivacity, had also some portion of the
Greek loquacity. His speeches indeed are highly characteristical;
and to them we are much indebted for that admirable display he has
given of human nature. Yet if he be tedious any where, it is in
these; some of them trifling; and some of them plainly unseason∣able.
Both poets are eminently sublime; but a difference may be
remarked in the species of their sublimity. Homer's sublimity is
accompanied with more impetuosity and fire; Ossian's with more of
a solemn and awful grandeur. Homer hurries you along; Ossian
elevates, and fixes you in astonishment. Homer is most sublime in
actions and battles; Ossian, in description and sentiment. In the
pathetick, Homer, when he chuses to exert it, has gret power;
but Ossian exerts that power much oftener, and has the character
of tenderness far more deeply imprinted on his works. No poet
knew better how to seize and melt the heart. With regard to dig∣nity
of sentiment, the pre-eminence must clearly be given to Ossian.
This is indeed a surprising circumstance, that in point of humanity,
magnanimity, virtuous feelings of every kind, our rude Celtic bard
should be distinguished to such a degree, that not only the heroes of
Homer, but even those of the polite and refined Virgil, are left far
behind by those of Ossian.</P>
<P>After these general observations on the genius and spirit of our au∣thor,
I now proceed to a nearer view, and more accurate examina∣tion
of his works: And as Fingal is the most considerable poem in
this collection, it is proper to begin with it. To refuse the title of
an epic poem to Fingal, because it is not in every little particular,
exactly conformable to the practice of Homer and Virgil, were the
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
mere squeamishness and pedantry of criticism. Examined even ac∣cording
to Aristotle's rules, it will be found to have all the essential
requisites of a true and regular epic; and to have several of them in
so high a degree, as at first view to raise our astonishment on finding
Ossian's composition so agreeable to rules of which he was entirely
ignorant. But our astonishment will cease, when we consider from
what source Aristotle drew those rules. Homer knew no more of
the laws of criticism than Ossian. But guided by nature, he com∣posed
in verse a regular story, founded on heroic actions, which all
posterity admired. Aristotle, with great sagacity and penetration,
traced the causes of this general admiration. He observed what it
was in Homer's composition, and in the conduct of his story, which
gave it such power to please; from this observation he deduced the
rules which poets ought to follow, who would write and please like
Homer; and to a composition formed according to such rules, he
gave the name of an epic poem. Hence his whole system arose.
Aristotle studied nature in Homer. Homer and Ossian both wrote
from nature. No wonder that among all the three, there should be
such agreement and conformity.</P>
<P>The fundamental rules delivered by Aristotle concerning an epic
poem, are these: That the action which is the ground work of the
poem, should be one, compleat, and great; that it should be
feigned, not merely historical; that it should be enlivened with
characters and manners; and heightened by the marvellous.</P>
<P>But before entering on any of these, it may perhaps be asked,
what is the moral of Fingal? For, according to M. Bossu, an epic
poem is no other than an allegory contrived to illustrate some moral
truth. The poet, says this critic, must begin with fixing on some
maxim, or instruction, which he intends to inculcate on mankind.
He next forms a fable, like one of Aesop's, wholly with a view to
the moral; and having thus settled and arranged his plan, he then
looks into traditionary history for names and incidents, to give his
fable some air of probability. Never did a more frigid, pedantic no∣tion,
enter into the mind of a critic. We may safely pronounce,
that he who should compose an epic poem after this manner, who
should first lay down a moral and contrive a plan, before he had
thought of his personages and actors, might deliver indeed very
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
sound instruction, but would find few readers. There cannot be
the least doubt that the first object which strikes an epic poet, which
fires his genius, and gives him any idea of his work, is the action or
subject he is to celebrate. Hardly is there any tale, any subject a
poet can chuse for such a work, but will afford some general moral
instruction. An epic poem is by its nature one of the most moral of
all poetical compositions: But its moral tendecy is by no means to
be limited to some common-place maxim, which may be gathered
from the story. It arises from the admiration of heroic actions,
which such a composition is peculiarly calculated to produce; from
the virtuous emotions which the characters and incidents raise,
whilst we read it; from the happy impression which all the parts
separately, as well as the whole taken together, leave upon the mind.
However, if a general moral be still insisted on, Fingal obviously
furnishes one, not inferior to that of any other Poet, viz. That
Wisdom and Bravery always triumph over brutal force; or another
nobler still; That the most compleat victory over an enemy is ob∣tained
by that moderation and generosity which convert him into
a friend.</P>
<P>The unity of the Epic action, which, of all Aristotle's rules,
is the chief and most material, is so strictly preserved in Fingal,
that it must be perceived by every reader. It is a more compleat
unity than what arises from relating the actions of one man, which
the Greek critic justly censures as imperfect; it is the unity of one
enterprise, the deliverance of Ireland from the invasion of Swa∣ran:
An enterprise, which has surely the full Heroic dignity. All
the incidents recorded bear a constant reference to one end; no
double plot is carried on; but the parts unite into a regular
whole: And as the action is one and great, so it is an entire or compleat
action. For we find, as the Critic farther requires, a beginning, a
middle, and an end; a Nodus, or intrigue in the Poem; Difficulties
occurring through Cuchullin's rashness and bad success; those dif∣ficulties
gradually surmounted; and at last the work conducted to
that happy conclusion which is held essential to Epic Poetry.
Unity is indeed observed with greater exactness in Fingal, than
in almost any other Epic composition. For not only is unity of
subject maintained, but that of time and place also. The Autumn
is clearly pointed out as the season of the action; and from begin∣ning
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
to end the scene is never shifted from the heath of Lena,
along the sea-shore. The duration of the action in Fingal, is much
shorter than in the Iliad or Aeneid. But sure, there may be
shorter as well as longer Heroic Poems; and if the authority of
Aristotle be also required for this, he says expresly that the Epic
composition is indefinite as to the time of its duration. Accordingly
the Action of the Iliad lasts only forty-seven days, whilst that of
the Aeneid is continued for more than a year.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole of Fingal, there reigns that grandeur of
sentiment, style and imagery, which ought ever to distinguish this
high species of poetry. The story is conducted with no small art.
The Poet goes not back to a tedious recital of the beginning of the
war with Swaran; but hastening to the main action, he falls in ex∣actly,
by a most happy coincidence of thought, with the rule of
Horace.</P>
<Q><L>Semper ad eventum festinat, &amp; in medias res,</L>
<L>Non secus as notas, auditorem rapit—</L>
<L>Nec gemino bellum Trojanum orditur ab ovo.</L>
<BIBL>De Arte Poet.</BIBL></Q>
<P>He invokes no muse, for he acknowledged none; but his occa∣sional
addresses to Malvina, have a finer effect than the invocation of
any muse. He sets out with no formal proposition of his subject;
but the subject naturally and easily unfolds its self; the poem
opening in an animated manner, with the situation of Cuchullin,
and the arrival of a scout who informs him of Swaran's landing.
Mention is presently made of Fingal, and of the expected assistance
from the ships of the lonely isle, in order to give further light to
the subject. For the poet often shows his address in gradually pre∣paring
us for the events he is to introduce; and in particular the pre∣paration
for the appearance of Fingal, the previous expectations that
are raised, and the extreme magnificence fully answering these ex∣pectations,
with which the hero is at length presented to us, are all
worked up with such skillful conduct as would do honour to any
poet of the most refined times. Homer's art in magnifying the
character of Achilles has been universally admired. Ossian cer∣tainly
shows no less art in aggrandizing Fingal. Nothing could be
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
more happily imagined for this purpose than the whole management
of the last battle, wherein Gaul the son of Morni, had besought
Fingal to retire, and to leave to him and his other chiefs the honour
of the day. The generosity of the King in agreeing to this propo∣sal;
the majesty with which he retreats to the hill, from whence
he was to behold the engagement, attended by his Bards, and
waving the lightning of his sword; his perceiving the chiefs over∣powered
by numbers, but loth to deprive them of the glory of
victory by coming in person to their assistance; his sending Ullin,
the Bard, to animate their courage; and at last, when the dan∣ger
becomes more pressing, his rising in his might, and interposing,
like a divinity, to decide the doubtful fate of the day; are all cir∣cumstances
contrived with so much art as plainly discover the Cel∣tic
Bards to have been not unpractised in Heroic poetry.</P>
<P>The story which is the foundation of the Iliad is in itself as simple
as that of Fingal. A quarrel arises between Achilles and Agamem∣non
concerning a female slave; on which, Achilles, apprehending
himself to be injured, withdraws his assistance from the rest of the
Greeks. The Greeks fall into great distress, and beseech him to be
reconciled to them. He refuses to fight for them in person, but
sends his friend Patroclus; and upon his being slain, goes forth to
revenge his death, and kills Hector. The subject of Fingal is this:
Swaran comes to invade Ireland: Cuchullin, the guardian of the
young King, had applied for assistance to Fingal, who reigned in the
opposite coast of Scotland. But before Fingal's arrival, he is hurried
by rash counsel to encounter Swaran. He is defeated; he retreats;
and desponds. Fingal arrives in this conjuncture. The battle is
for some time dubious; but in the end he conquers Swaran; and the
remembrance of Swaran's being the brother of Agandecca, who had
once saved his life, makes him dismiss him honourably. Homer it is
true has filled up his story with a much greater variety of particulars
than Ossian; and in this has shown a compass of invention superior
to that of the other poet. But it must not be forgotten, that though
Homer be more circumstantial, his incidents however are less di∣versified
in kind than those of Ossian. War and bloodshed reign
throughout the Iliad; and notwithstanding all the fertility of Ho∣mer's
invention, there is so much uniformity in his subjects, that
there are few readers, who, before the close, are not tired of perpetual
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
fighting. Whereas in Ossian, the mind is relieved by a more agree∣able
diversity. There is a finer mixture of war and heroism, with
love and friendship, of martial, with tender scenes, than is to be
met with, perhaps, in any other poet. The Episodes too, have
great propriety; as natural, and proper to that age and country:
consisting of the songs of Bards, which are known to have been the
great entertainment of the Celtic heroes in war, as well as in peace.
These songs are not introduced at random; if you except the Epi∣sode
of Duchommar and Morna, in the first book, which, though
beautiful, is more unartful, than any of the rest, they have always
some particular relation to the actor who is interested, or to the
events which are going on; and, whilst they vary the scene, they
preserve a sufficient connection with the main subject, by the fitness
and propriety of their introduction.</P>
<P>As Fingal's love to Agandecca, influences some circumstances of
the Poem, particularly the honourable dismission of Swaran at the
end; it was necessary that we should be let into this part of the
hero's story. But as it lay without the compass of the present ac∣tion,
it could be regularly introduced no where, except in an Epi∣sode.
Accordingly the poet, with as much propriety, as if Aristotle
himself had directed the plan, has contrived an Episode for this pur∣pose
in the song of Carril, at the beginning of the third book.</P>
<P>The conclusion of the poem is strictly according to rule; and is
every way noble and pleasing. The reconciliation of the contending
heroes, the consolation of Cuchullin, and the general felicity that
crowns the action, sooth the mind in a very agreeable manner, and
form that passage from agitation and trouble, to perfect quiet and
repose, which critics require as the proper termination of the Epic
work. “Thus they passed the night in song, and brought back
the morning with joy. Fingal arose on the heath; and shook
his glittering spear in his hand. He moved first towards the
plains of Lena; and we followed like a ridge of fire. Spread
the sail, said the King of Morven, and catch the winds that
pour from Lena.—We rose on the wave with songs; and rushed
with joy through the foam of the ocean.”—So much for the
unity and general conduct of the Epic action in Fingal.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
With regard to that property of the subject which Aristotle re∣quires
that it should be feigned not historical, he must not be un∣derstood
so strictly, as if he meant to exclude all subjects which have
any foundation in truth. For such exclusion would both be unrea∣sonable
in itself; and what is more, would be contrary to the prac∣tice
of Homer, who is known to have founded his Iliad on historical
facts concerning the war of Troy, which was famous throughout
all Greece. Aristotle means no more than that it is the business of
a poet not to be a mere annalist of Facts, but to embellish truth
with beautiful, probable, and useful fictions; to copy nature, as
he himself explains it, like painters, who preserve a likeness, but
exhibit their objects more grand and beautiful than they are in reality.
That Ossian has followed this course, and building upon true history,
has sufficiently adorned it with poetical fiction for aggrandizing his
characters and facts, will not, I believe, be questioned by most
readers. At the same time, the foundation which those facts and
characters had in truth, and the share which the poet himself had
in the transactions which he records, must be considered as no
small advantage to his work. For truth makes an impression on the
mind far beyond any fiction; and no man, let his imagination be
ever so strong, relates any events so feelingly as those in which he has
been interested; paints any scene so naturally as one which he has
seen; or draws any characters in such strong colours as those which
he has personally known. It is considered as an advantage of the
Epic subject to be taken from a period so distant, as by being in∣volved
in the darkness of tradition, may give licence to fable.
Though Ossian's subject may at first view appear unfavourable in
this respect, as being taken from his own times, yet when we reflect
that he lived to an extreme old age; that he relates what had been
transacted in another country, at the distance of many years, and
after all that race of men who had been the actors were gone off the
stage; we shall find the objection in a great measure obviated. In
so rude an age, when no written records were known, when tra∣dition
was loose, and accuracy of any kind little attended to, what
was great and heroic in one generation, easily ripened into the mar∣vellous
in the next.</P>
<P>The natural representation of human characters in an Epic Poem
is highly essential to its merit: And in respect to this there can be
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
no doubt of Homer's excelling all the heroic poets who have ever
wrote. But though Ossian be much inferior to Homer in this ar∣ticle,
he will be found to be equal at least, if not superior, to Virgil;
and has indeed given all the display of human nature which the
simple occurrences of his times could be expected to furnish. No
dead uniformity of character prevails in Fingal; but on the contrary
the principal characters are not only clearly distinguished, but some∣times
artfully contrasted so as to illustrate each other. Ossian's he∣roes
are like Homer's, all brave; but their bravery, like those of
Homer's too, is of different kinds. For instance; the prudent,
the sedate, the modest and circumspect Connal, is finely opposed to
the presumptuous, rash, overbearing, but gallant and generous Cal∣mar.
Calmar hurries Cuchullin into action by his temerity; and
when he sees the bad effect of his counsels, he will not survive the
disgrace. Connal, like another Ulysses, attends Cuchullin to his
retreat, counsels, and comforts him under his misfortune. The
fierce, the proud, and high spirited Swaran is admirably contrasted
with the calm, the moderate, and generous Fingal. The character
of Oscar is a favourite one throughout the whole Poems. The
amiable warmth of the young warrior; his eager impetuosity in the
day of action; his passion for fame; his submission to his father;
his tenderness for Malvina; are the strokes of a masterly pencil;
the strokes are few; but it is the hand of nature, and attracts the
heart. Ossian's own character, the old man, the hero, and the
bard, all in one, presents to us through the whole work a most
respectable and venerable figure, which we always contemplate with
pleasure. Cuchullin is a hero of the highest class; daring, mag∣nanimous,
and exquisitely sensible to honour. We become attached
to his interest, and are deeply touched with his distress; and after
the admiration raised for him in the first part of the Poem, it is a
strong proof of Ossian's masterly genius that he durst adventure to
produce to us another hero, compared with whom, even the great
Cuchullin, should be only an inferior personage; and who should
rise as far above him, as Cuchullin rises above the rest.</P>
<P>Here indeed, in the character and description of Fingal, Ossian
triumphs almost unrivalled: For we may boldly defy all antiquity to
shew us any hero equal to Fingal. Homer's Hector possesses seve∣ral
great and amiable qualities; but Hector is a secondary personage
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
in the Iliad, not the hero of the work. We see him only occa∣sionally;
we know much less of him than we do of Fingal; who
not only in the Epic Poem, but throughout the rest of Ossian's
works, is presented in all that variety of lights, which give the full
display of a character. And though Hector faithfully discharges his
duty to his country, his friends, and his family, he is tincutured,
however, with a degree of the same savage ferocity, which prevails
among all the Homeric heroes. For we find him insulting over the
fallen Patroclus, with the most cruel taunts, and telling him, when
he lies in the agony of death, that Achilles cannot help him now;
and that in a short time his body, stripped naked, and deprived of
funeral honours, shall be devoured by the Vulturs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iliad 16. 830. Il. 17. 127.</NOTE>. Whereas in
the character of Fingal, concur almost all the qualities that can en∣noble
human nature; that can either make us admire the hero, or
love the man. He is not only unconquerable in war, but he makes
his people happy by his wisdom in the days of peace<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 62.</NOTE>. He is
truly the father of his people. He is known by the epithet of
“Fingal of the mildest look;” and distinguished on every occasion,
by humanity and generosity. He is merciful to his foes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">When he commands his sons, after Swaran is taken prisoner, to “pursue the rest of Lochlin, over the heath of Lena; that no vessel may hereafter bound on the dark-rolling waves of Inistore;” he means not assuredly, as some have misrepresented him, to order a general slaughter of the foes, and to pre∣vent their saving themselves by flight; but, like a wise general, he commands his chiefs to render the victory compleat, by a total rout of the enemy; that they might adventure no more for the future, to fit out any fleet against him or his al∣lies.</NOTE>; full of
affection to his children; full of concern about his friends; and
never mentions Agandecca, his first love, without the utmost ten∣derness.
He is the universal protector of the distressed; “None
ever went sad from Fingal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 74.</NOTE>.”—“O Oscar! bend the strong
in arms; but spare the feeble hand. Be thou a stream of many
tides against the foes of thy people; but like the gale that moves
the grass, to those who ask thine aid. So Trenmor lived; such
Trathal was; and such has Fingal been. My arm was the sup∣port
of the injured; the weak rested behind the lightning of my
steel<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 44.</NOTE>.”—These were the maxims of true heroism, to which he
formed his grandson. His fame is represented as every where
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
spread; the greatest heroes acknowledge his superiority; his ene∣mies
tremble at his name; and the highest encomium that can be
bestowed on one whom the poet would most exalt, is to say, that his
soul was like the soul of Fingal.</P>
<P>To do justice to the poet's merit, in supporting such a character
as this, I must observe, what is not commonly attended to, that
there is no part of poetical execution more difficult, than to draw a per∣fect
character in such a manner, as to render it distinct and affecting
to the mind. Some strokes of human imperfection and frailty, are
what usually give us the most clear view, and the most sensible
impression of a character; because they present to us a man, such
as we have seen; they recall known features of human nature.
When poets attempt to go beyond this range, and describe a fault∣less
hero, they, for the most part, set before us, a sort of vague un∣distinguishable
character, such as the imagination cannot lay hold of,
or realize to itself, as the object of affection. We know how
much Virgil has failed in this particular. His perfect hero, Aeneas,
is an unanimated, insipid personage, whom we may pretend to
admire, but whom no one can heartily love. But what Virgil has failed
in, Ossian, to our astonishment, has successfully executed. His
Fingal, though exhibited without any of the common human failings,
is nevertheless a real man; a character which touches and interests
every reader. To this it has much contributed, that the poet has
represented him as an old man; and by this has gained the advan∣tage
of throwing around him a great many circumstances, peculiar
to that age, which paint him to the fancy in a more distinct light.
He is surrounded with his family; he instructs his children in the
principles of virtue; he is narrative of his past exploits; he is vene∣rable
with the grey locks of age; he is frequently disposed to mo∣ralize,
like an old man, on human vanity and the prospect of
death. There is more art, at least more felicity, in this, than may
at first be imagined. For youth and old age, are the two states of
human life, capable of being placed in the most picturesque lights.
Middle age is more general and vague; and has fewer circumstances
peculiar to the idea of it. And when any object is in a situation,
that admits it to be rendered particular, and to be cloathed with a
variety of circumstances, it always stands out more clear and full in
poetical description.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
Besides human personages, divine or supernatural agents are
often introduced into epic poetry; forming what is called the ma∣chinery
of it; which most critics hold to be an essential part. The
marvellous, it must be admitted, has always a great charm for the
bulk of readers. It gratifies the imagination, and affords room for
striking and sublime description. No wonder therefore, that all
poets should have a strong propensity towards it. But I must ob∣serve,
that nothing is more difficult, than to adjust properly the
marvellous with the probable. If a poet sacrifice probability, and
fill his work, as Tasso has done, with extravagant supernatural
scenes, he spreads over it an appearance of romance and childish
fiction; he transports his readers from this world, into a phantas∣tick,
visionary region; and loses that weight and dignity which
should reign in epic poetry. No work, from which probability is
altogether banished, can make a lasting or deep impression. Hu∣man
actions and manners, are always the most interesting objects
which can be presented to a human mind. All machinery, there∣fore,
is faulty which withdraws these too much from view; or ob∣scures
them under a cloud of incredible fictions. Besides being
temperately employed machinery ought always to have some foun∣dation
in popular belief. A poet is by no means at liberty to in∣vent
what system of the marvellous he pleases: He must avail him∣self
either of the religious faith, or the superstitious credulity of the
country wherein he lives; so as to give an air of probability to
events which are most contrary to the common course of nature.</P>
<P>In these respects, Ossian appears to me to have been remark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly
happy. He has indeed followed the same course with H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer.
For it is perfectly absurd to imagine, as some critics have done,
that Homer's mythology was invented by him, in consequence of
profound reflections on the benefit it would yield to poetry. Homer
was no such refining genius. He found the traditionary stories on
which he built his Iliad, mingled with popular legends, concern∣ing
the intervention of the gods; and he adopted these, because they
amused the fancy. Ossian, in like manner, found the tales of his
country full of ghosts and spirits: It is likely he believed them him∣self;
and he introduced them, because they gave his poems that
solemn and marvellous cast, which suited his genius. This was
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
the only machinery he could employ with propriety; because it was
the only intervention of supernatural beings, which agreed with the
common belief of the country. It was happy; because it did not
interfere in the least, with the proper display of human characters
and actions; because it had less of the incredible, than most other
kinds of poetical machinery; and because it served to diversify the
scene, and to heighten the subject by an awful grandeur, which is
the great design of machinery.</P>
<P>As Ossian's mythology is peculiar to himself, and makes a con∣siderable
figure in his other poems, as well as in Fingal, it may be
proper to make some observations on it, independent of its subser∣viency
to epic composition. It turns for the most part on the ap∣pearances
of departed spirits. These, consonantly to the notions of
every rude age, are represented not as purely immaterial, but as
thin airy forms, which can be visible or invisible at pleasure; their
voice is feeble; their arm is weak; but they are endowed with
knowledge more than human. In a separate state, they retain the
same dispostions which animated them in this life. They ride on
the wind; they bend their airy bows; and pursue deer formed of
clouds. The ghosts of departed bards continue to sing. The
ghosts of departed heroes frequent the fields of their former fame.
“They rest together in their caves, and talk of mortal men.
Their songs are of other worlds. They come sometimes to the
ear of rest, and raise their feeble voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P. 24, 27, 103, 107, 218, 254.</NOTE>.” All this presents to us
much the same set of ideas, concerning spirits, as we find in the ele∣venth
book of the Odyssey, where Ulysses visits the regions of the
dead: And in the twenty-third book of the Iliad, the ghost of
Patroclus, after appearing to Achilles, vanishes precisely like one
of Ossian's emitting a shrill, feeble cry, and melting away like
smoke.</P>
<P>But though Homer's and Ossian's ideas concerning ghosts were
of the same nature, we cannot but observe, that Ossian's ghosts are
drawn with much stronger and livelier colours than those of Homer.
Ossian describes ghosts with all the particularity of one who had
seen and conversed with them, and whose imagination was full of
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
the impression they had left upon it. He calls up those awful and
tremendous ideas which the
<Q>—Simulacra modis pallentia miris,</Q>
are fitted to raise in the human mind; and which, in Shakespear's
style, “harrow up the soul.” Crugal's ghost, in particular, in the
beginning of the second book of Fingal, may vie with any ap∣pearance
of this kind, described by any epic or tragic poet whatever.
Most poets would have contented themselves with telling us, that he
resembled, in every particular, the living Crugal; that his form and
dress were the same, only his face more pale and sad; and that he
bore the mark of the wound by which he fell. But Ossian sets be∣fore
our eyes a spirit from the invisible world; distinguished by all
those features, which a strong astonished imagination would give
to a ghost. “A dark-red stream of fire comes down from the hill.
Crugal sat upon the beam; he that lately fell by the hand of
Swaran, striving in the battle of heroes. His face is like the
beam of the setting moon. His robes are of the clouds of the
hill. His eyes are like two decaying flames. Dark is the wound
of his breast.—The stars dim-twinkled through his form;
and his voice was like the sound of a distant stream.” The cir∣cumstance
of the stars being beheld, “dim-twinkling through his
form,” is wonderfully picturesque; and conveys the most lively
impression of his thin and shadowy substance. The attitude in
which he is afterwards placed, and the speech put into his mouth,
are full of that solemn and awful sublimity, which suits the subject.
“Dim, and in tears, he stood and stretched his pale hand over
the hero. Faintly he raised his feeble voice, like the gale of the
reedy Lego.—My ghost, O Connal! is on my native hills; but
my corse is on the sands of Ullin. Thou shalt never talk with
Crugal, or find his lone steps in the heath. I am light as the
blast of Cromla; and I move like the shadow of mist. Connal,
son of Colgar! I see the dark cloud of death. It hovers over the
plains of Lena. The sons of green Erin shall fall. Remove
from the field of ghosts.—Like the darkened moon he retired, in
the midst of the whistling blast.”</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38"/>
Several other appearances of spirits might be pointed out, as
among the most sublime passages of Ossian's poetry. The circum∣stances
of them are considerably diversified; and the scenery always
suited to the occasion. “Oscar slowly ascends the hill. The me∣teors
of night set on the heath before him. A distant torrent
faintly roars. Unfrequent blasts rush through aged oaks. The
half-enlightened moon sinks dim and red behind her hill. Fee∣ble
voices are heard on the heath. Oscar drew his sword.”—Nothing
can prepare the fancy more happily for the awful scene that
is to follow. “Trenmor came from his hill, at the voice of his
mighty son. A cloud, like the steed of the stranger, supported
his airy limbs. His robe is of the mist of Lano, that brings
death to the people. His sword is a green meteor, half-extin∣guished.
His face is without form, and dark. He sighed thrice
over the hero: And thrice, the winds of the night roared
around. Many were his words to Oscar—He slowly va∣nished,
like a mist that melts on the sunny hill<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 100, 101.</NOTE>.” To ap∣pearances
of this kind, we can find no parallel among the Greek
or Roman poets. They bring to mind that noble description in the
book of Job: “In thoughts from the visions of the night, when
deep sleep falleth on men, fear came upon me, and trembling,
which made all my bones to shake. Then a spirit passed before
my face. The hair of my flesh stood up. It stood still; but I
could not discern the form thereof. An image was before mine
eyes. There was silence; and I heard a voice—Shall mortal
man be more just than God?”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job iv. 13—17.</NOTE></P>
<P>As Ossian's supernatural beings are described with a surprizing
force of imagination, so they are introduced with propriety. We
have only three ghosts in Fingal: That of Crugal, which comes to
warn the host of impending destruction, and to advise them to save
themselves by retreat; that of Evirallin, the spouse of Ossian, which
calls him to rise and rescue their son from danger; and that of
Agandecca, which, just before the last engagement with Swaran,
moves Fingal to pity, by mourning for the approaching destruction
of her kinsmen and people. In the other poems, ghosts sometimes
appear when invoked to foretell futurity; frequently, according to
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
the notions of these times, they come as fore-runners of misfortune
or death, to those whom they visit; sometimes they inform their
friends at a distance, of their own death; and sometimes they are
introduced to heighten the scenery on some great and solemn occa∣sion.
“A hundred oaks burn to the wind; and faint light gleams
over the heath. The ghosts of Ardven pass through the beam;
and shew their dim and distant forms. Comala is half-unseen on
her meteor; and Hidallan is sullen and dim<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 97.</NOTE>.”—“The awful
faces of other times, looked from the clouds of Crona.”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 88.</NOTE>—“Fercuth!
I saw the ghost of night. Silent he stood on that
bank; his robe of mist flew on the wind. I could behold his
tears. An aged man he seemed, and full of thought<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 123.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The ghosts of strangers mingle not with those of the natives.
“She is seen; but not like the daughters of the hill. Her robes
are from the strangers land; and she is still alone<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 140.</NOTE>.” When
the ghost of one whom we had formerly known is introduced, the
propriety of the living character is still preserved. This is remark∣able
in the appearance of Calmar's ghost, in the poem entitled
The Death of Cuchullin. He seems to forebode Cuchullin's
death, and to beckon him to his cave. Cuchullin reproaches him
for supposing that he could be intimidated by such prognostics.
“Why dost thou bend thy dark eyes on me, ghost of the car∣borne
Calmar! Would'st thou frighten me, O Matha's son!
from the battles of Cormac? Thy hand was not feeble in war;
neither was thy voice for peace. How art thou changed, chief
of Lara! if now thou dost advise to fly!—Retire thou to thy
cave: Thou art not Calmar's ghost: He delighted in battle; and
his arm was like the thunder of heaven.” Calmar makes no
return to this seeming reproach: But, “He retired in his blast
with joy; for he had heard the voice of his praise<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 150.</NOTE>.” This is
precisely the ghost of Achilles in Homer; who, notwithstanding
all the dissatisfaction he expresses with his state in the region of the
dead, as soon as he had heard his son Neoptolemus praised for
his gallant behaviour, strode away with silent joy to rejoin the rest
of the shades.<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Odyss. Lib. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="40"/>
It is a great advantage of Ossian's mythology, that it is not local
and temporary, like that of most other ancient poets; which of
course is apt to seem ridiculous, after the superstitions have passed
away on which it was founded. Ossian's mythology is, to speak
so, the mythology of human nature; for it is founded on what
has been the popular belief, in all ages and countries, and under all
forms of religion, concerning the appearances of departed spirits.
Homer's machinery is always lively and amusing; but far from be∣ing
always supported with proper dignity. The indecent squabbles
among his gods, surely do no honour to epic poetry. Whereas
Ossian's machinery has dignity upon all occasions. It is indeed a
dignity of the dark and awful kind; but this is proper; because co∣incident
with the strain and spirit of the poetry. A light and gay
mythology, like Homer's, would have been perfectly unsuitable
to the subjects on which Ossian's genius was employed. But though
his machinery be always solemn, it is not, however, always dreary
or dismal; it is enlivened, as much as the subject would permit, by
those pleasant and beautiful appearances, which he sometimes in∣troduces,
of the spirits of the hill. These are gentle spirits; de∣scending
on sun-beams; fair-moving on the plain; their forms
white and bright; their voices sweet; and their visits to men pro∣pitious.
The greatest praise that can be given, to the beauty of a
living woman, is to say, “She is fair as the ghost of the hill; when
it moves in a sun-beam at noon, over the silence of Morven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>.”
—“The hunter shall hear my voice from his booth. He shall
fear, but love my voice. For sweet shall my voice be for my
friends; for pleasant were they to me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 212.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Besides ghosts, or the spirits of departed men, we find in Ossian
some instances of other kinds of machinery. Spirits of a superior
nature to ghosts, seem to be sometimes alluded to, which have
power to embroil the deep; to call forth winds and storms, and
pour them on the land of the stranger; to overturn forests, and to
send death among the people<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vid. P. 39, 114, 13, 102, 180.</NOTE>. We have prodigies too; a shower
of blood; and when some disaster is befalling at a distance, the
sound of death heard on the strings of Ossian's harp<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 133, 168.</NOTE>: all per∣fectly
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
consonant, not only to the peculiar ideas of northern nations,
but to the general current of a superstitious imagination in all coun∣tries.
The description of Fingal's airy hall, in the poem called
Berrathon, and the ascent of Malvina into it, deserves particular no∣tice,
as remarkably noble and magnificent. But above all, the en∣gagement
of Fingal with the spirit of Loda, in Carric-thura, can∣not
be mentioned without admiration. I forbear transcribing the
passage, as it must have drawn the attention of every one who has
read the works of Ossian. The undaunted courage of Fingal, op∣posed
to all the terrors of the Scandinavian god; the appearance and
the speech of that awful spirit; the wound which he receives, and
the shriek which he sends forth, “as rolled into himself, he rose
upon the wind;” are full of the most amazing and terrible ma∣jesty.
I know no passage more sublime in the writings of any un∣inspired
author. The fiction is calculated to aggrandize the hero;
which it does to a high degree; nor is it so unnatural or wild a fic∣tion,
as might at first be thought. According to the notions of
those times, supernatural beings were material, and consequently,
vulnerable. The spirit of Loda was not acknowledged as a deity
by Fingal; he did not worship at the stone of his power; he
plainly considered him as the God of his enemies only; as a local
Deity, whose dominion extended no farther than to the regions
where he was worshiped; who had, therefore, no title to threaten
him, and no claim to his submission. We know there are poetical pre∣cedents
of great authority, for fictions fully as extravagant; and if
Homer be forgiven for making Diomed attack and wound in battle,
the gods whom that chief himself worshiped, Ossian surely is par∣donable
for making his hero superior to the god of a foreign terri∣tory<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The scene of this encounter of Fingal with the spirit of Loda is laid in Inistore, or the islands of Orkney; and in the descrip∣tion of Fingal's landing there, it is said, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>98. “A rock bends along the coast with all its echoing wood. On the top is the circle of Loda, with the mossy stone of power.” In confirmation of Ossian's topography, it is proper to ac∣quaint the reader that in these islands, as I have been well informed, there are many pillars, and circles of stones, still remaining, known by the name of the stones and circles of Loda, or Loden; to which some degree of superstitious regard is annexed to this day. These islands, until the year 1468, made a part of the Danish dominions. Their ancient lan∣guage, of which there are yet some remains among the natives, is called the Norse; and is a dialect, not of the Celtic, but of the Scandinavian tongue. The manners and the superstitions of the inhabitants, are quite distinct from those of the Highlands and western isles of Scotland. Their an∣cient songs too, are of a different strain and character, turning upon magical incan∣tations and evocations from the dead, which were the favourite subjects of the old Runic poetry. They have many tra∣ditions among them of wars in former times with the inhabitants of the western Islands.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="42"/>
Notwithstanding the poetical advantages which I have ascribed
to Ossian's machinery, I acknowledge it would have been much
more beautiful and perfect, had the author discovered some know∣ledge
of a supream Being. Although his silence on this head has
been accounted for by the learned and ingenious translator in a very
probable manner, yet still it must be held a considerable disadvan∣tage
to the poetry. For the most august and lofty ideas that can
embellish poetry are derived from the belief of a divine administration
of the universe: And hence the invocation of a supream Being, or
at least of some superior powers who are conceived as presiding over
human affairs, the solemnities of religious worship, prayers pre∣ferred,
and assistance implored on critical occasions, appear with
great dignity in the works of almost all poets as chief ornaments of
their compositions. The absence of all such religious ideas from
Ossian's poetry, is a sensible blank in it; the more to be regretted,
as we can easily imagine what an illustrious figure they would have
made under the management of such a genius as his; and how
finely they would have been adapted to many situations which
occur in his works.</P>
<P>The high merit of Fingal, as an Epic Poem, required a particular
discussion. But though the art shown in conducting a work of
such length distinguishes it above the other poems in this collection,
these, however, contain particular beauties equal, perhaps superior,
to any in Fingal. They are historical poems, generally of the ele∣giac
kind; and plainly discover themselves to be the work of the
same author. One consistent face of manners is every where pre∣sented
to us; one spirit of poetry reigns; the masterly hand of
Ossian appears throughout; the same rapid and animated style;
the same strong colouring of imagination, and the same glowing
sensibility of heart. Besides the unity which belongs to the compo∣sitions
of one man, there is moreover a certain unity of subject which
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
very happily connects all these poems. They form the poetical history
of the age of Fingal. The same race of heroes whom we had met
with in the Epic poem, Cuchullin, Oscar, Connal and Gaul return
again upon the stage; and Fingal himself is always the principal
figure, presented on every occasion, with equal magnificence, nay
rising upon us to the last. The circumstances of Ossian's old age
and blindness, his surviving all his friends, and his relating their
great exploits to Malvina, the spouse or mistress of his beloved son
Oscar, furnish the finest poetical situations that fancy could devise
for that tender pathetic which reigns in Ossian's poetry.</P>
<P>As each of these poems have their particular merit, there might
be room for examining them separately, and for showing, in many
instances, what art there is in the conduct and disposition of the
incidents, as well as what beauty in the descriptions and sentiments.
Carthon is a regular and highly finished piece. The main story is
very properly introduced by Clessammor's relation of the adventure
of his youth; and this introduction is finely heightened by Fingal's
song of mourning over Moina; in which Ossian, ever fond of
doing honour to his father, has contrived to distinguish him, for
being an eminent poet, as well as warrior. Fingal's song upon this
occasion, when “his thousand Bards leaned forwards from their
seats, to hear the voice of the King,” is inferior to no passage
in the whole book; and with great judgment put in his mouth,
as the seriousness, no less than the sublimity of the strain, is peculiarly
suited to the Hero's character. Temora is the opening of an Epic
Poem, which appears to be equal in every respect to Fingal. The
contrast between the characters of Cathmar and Cairbar, the death
of Oscar, and the assassination of the young prince Cormac, are such
interesting scenes, as give the greatest reason to wish the recovery
of the sequel. In Darthula are assembled almost all the tender
images that can touch the heart of man: Friendship, love, the
affections of parents, sons, and brothers, the distress of
the aged, and the unavailing bravery of the young. The beautiful
address to the moon, with which the poem opens, and the transi∣tion
from thence to the subject, most happily prepare the mind for
that train of affecting events that is to follow. The story is regular,
dramatic, interesting to the last. He who can read it without emo∣tion
may congratulate himself, if he pleases, upon being completely
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
armed against sympathetic sorrow. As Fingal had no occasion of
appearing in the action of this poem, Ossian makes a very artful
transition from his narration, to what was passing in the halls of
Selma. The sound heard there on the strings of his harp, the con∣cern
which Fingal shows on hearing it, and the invocation of the
ghosts of their fathers, to receive the Heroes falling in a distant land,
are introduced with great beauty of imagination to increase the so∣lemnity,
and to diversify the scenery of the poem.</P>
<P>Carric-thura is full of the most sublime dignity; and has this ad∣vantage
of being more chearful in the subject, and more happy in
the catastrophe than most of the other poems: Though tempered
at the same time with episodes in that strain of tender melancholy,
which seems to have been the great delight of Ossian and the Bards of
his age. Lathmon is peculiarly distinguished, by high generosity of
sentiment. This is carried so far, particularly in the refusal of
Gaul, on one side, to take the advantage of a sleeping foe; and of
Lathmon, on the other, to overpower by numbers the two young
warriors, as to recall into one's mind the manners of Chivalry;
some resemblance to which may perhaps be suggested by other
incidents in this collection of Poems. Chivalry, however,
took rise in an age and country too remote from those of
Ossian to admit the suspicion that the one could have borrowed
any thing from the other. So far as Chivalry had any real
existence, the same military enthusiasm, which gave birth to
it in the feudal times, might, in the days of Ossian, that is, in the
infancy of a rising state, through the operation of the same cause,
very naturally produce effects of the same kind on the minds and
manners of men. So far as Chivalry was an ideal system existing
only in romance, it will not be thought surprising, when we reflect
on the account before given of the Celtic Bards, that this ima∣ginary
refinement of heroic manners should be found among them,
as much, at least, as among the <HI>Trobadores,</HI> or strolling Provençal
Bards, in the 10th or 11th century; whose songs, it is said, first
gave rise to those romantic ideas of heroism, which for so long a
time enchanted Europe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Huetius de origine fabularum Romanensium.</NOTE>. Ossian's heroes have all the gallantry
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
and generosity of those fabulous knights, without their extravagance;
and his love scenes have native tenderness, without any mixture of
those forced and unnatural conceits which abound in the old roman∣ces.
The adventures related by our poet which resemble the most
those of romance, concern women who follow their lovers to
war disguised in the armour of men; and these are so managed as to
produce, in the discovery, several of the most interesting situations;
one beautiful instance of which may be seen in Carric-thura, and
another in Calthon and Colmal.</P>
<P>Oithona presents a situation of a different nature. In the absence
of her lover Gaul, she had been carried off and ravished by Dun∣rommath.
Gaul discovers the place where she is concealed, and
comes to revenge her. The meeting of the two lovers, the sentiments
and the behaviour of Oithona on that occasion, are described with
such tender and exquisite propriety, as does the greatest honour
both to the art and to the delicacy of our author; and would have
been admired in any poet of the most refined age. The conduct of
Croma must strike every reader as remarkably judicious and beau∣tiful.
We are to be prepared for the death of Malvina, which is
related in the succeeding Poem. She is therefore introduced in
person; “she has heard a voice in a dream; she feels the flut∣tering
of her soul;” and in a most moving lamentation addressed
to her beloved Oscar, she sings her own Death Song. Nothing
could be calculated with more art to sooth and comfort her, than
the story which Ossian relates. In the young and brave Fovar∣gormo,
another Oscar is introduced; his praises are sung; and
the happiness is set before her of those who die in their youth,
“when their renown is around them; before the feeble behold
them in the hall, and smile at their trembling hands.”</P>
<P>But no where does Ossian's genius appear to greater advantage,
than in the concluding poem of the whole collection, “The last
sound of the Voice of Cona.”</P>
<Q><L>Qualis olor noto positurus littore vitam,</L>
<L>Ingemit, et maestis mulcens concentibus auras</L>
<L>Praesago queritur venientia funera cantu.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="44" REF="46"/>
The whole train of ideas is admirably suited to the subject. Every
thing is full of that invisible world, into which the aged Bard be∣lieves
himself now ready to enter. The airy hall of Fingal presents
itself to his view; “he sees the cloud that shall receive his ghost;
he beholds the mist that shall form his robe when he appears on
his hill;” and all the natural objects around him seem to carry
the presages of death. “The thistle shakes its beard to the wind.
“The flower hangs its heavy head—it seems to say, I am covered
with the drops of heaven; the time of my departure is near,
and the blast that shall scatter my leaves.” Malvina's death is
hinted to him in the most delicate manner by the son of Alpin.
His lamentation over her, her apotheosis, or ascent to the habitation
of heroes, and the introduction to the story which follows from the
mention which Ossian supposes the father of Malvina to make of
him in the hall of Fingal, are all in the highest spirit of Poetry.
“And dost thou remember Ossian, O Toscar son of Comloch?
The battles of our youth were many; our swords went together
to the field.”—Nothing could be more proper than to end his
songs with recording an exploit of the father of that Malvina, of
whom his heart was now so full; and who, from first to last, had
been such a favourite object throughout all his poems.</P>
<P>But as a separate discussion of the merit of each of the poems in
this collection would lead us too far, I shall content myself with
making some observations on the chief beauties of our author under
the general heads of Description, Imagery, and Sentiment.</P>
<P>A poet of original genius is always distinguished by his talent
for description<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the rules of poetical description excellently illustrated by lord Kaims, in his Elements of Critici<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, vol. iii. chap. 21. Of narration and description.</NOTE>. A second rate writer discerns nothing new or pe∣culiar
in the object he means to describe. His conceptions of it are
vague and loose; his expressions feeble; and of course the object is
presented to us indistinctly and as through a cloud. But a true
Poet makes us imagine that we see it before our eyes: he catches
the distinguishing features; he gives it the colours of life and reality;
he places it in such a light that a painter could copy after him.
This happy talent is chiefly owing to a lively imagination, which

first receives a strong impression of the object; and then, by a pro∣per
selection of capital picturesque circumstances employed in de∣scribing
it, transmits that impression in its full force to the imagi∣nations
of others. That Ossian possesses this descriptive power in
a high degree, we have a clear proof from the effect which his
descriptions produce upon the imaginations of those who read him
with any degree of attention and taste. Few poets are more inte∣resting.
We contract an intimate acquaintance with his principal
heroes. The characters, the manners, the face of the country be∣come
familiar; we even think we could draw the figure of his
ghosts: In a word, whilst reading him, we are transported as into
a new region, and dwell among his objects as if they were all real.</P>
<P>It were easy to point out several instances of exquisite painting in
the works of our author. Such, for instance as the scenery with
which Temora opens, and the attitude in which Caribar is there
presented to us<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 172, 173.</NOTE>; the description of the young prince Cormac, in
the same book<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 185.</NOTE>; and the ruins of Balclutha in Carthon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 132.</NOTE>. “I
have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they were desolate. The
fire had resounded in the halls; and the voice of the people is
heard no more. The stream of Clutha was removed from its
place by the fall of the walls. The thistle shook there its lonely
head: The moss whistled to the wind. The fox looked out
from the windows; the rank grass of the wall waved round
his head. Desolate is the dwelling of Moina; silence is in
the house of her fathers.” Nothing also can be more natural
and lively than the manner in which Carthon afterwards de∣scribes
how the conflagration of his city affected him when a
child: “Have I not seen the fallen Balclutha? And shall I feast
with Comhal's son? Comhal! who threw his fire in the
midst of my father's hall! I was young and knew not the cause
why the virgins wept. The columns of smoke pleased mine
eye, when they rose above my walls: I often looked back
with gladness, when my friends fled above the hill. But when
the years of my youth came on, I beheld the moss of my fallen
walls. My sigh arose with the morning; and my tears descended
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
with night. Shall I not fight, I said to my soul, against the
children of my foes? And I will fight, O Bard! I feel the
strength of my soul<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 135.</NOTE>.” In the same poem, the assembling of
the chiefs round Fingal, who had been warned of some impending
danger by the appearance of a prodigy, is described with so many
picturesque circumstances, that one imagines himself present in the
assembly. “The king alone beheld the terrible sight, and he
foresaw the death of his people. He came in silence to his hall,
and took his father's spear; the mail rattled on his breast. The
heroes rose around. They looked in silence on each other,
marking the eyes of Fingal. They saw the battle in his face.—A
thousand shields are placed at once on their arms; and
they drew a thousand swords. The hall of Selma brightened
around. The clang of arms ascends. The grey dogs howl in
their place. No word is among the mighty chiefs. Each
marked the eyes of the King; and half assumed his spear<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 133.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>It has been objected to Ossian, that his descriptions of military
actions are imperfect, and much less diversified by circumstances
than those of Homer. This is in some measure true. The amazing
fertility of Homer's invention is no where so much displayed as in
the incidents of his battles, and in the little history pieces he gives
of the persons slain. Nor indeed, with regard to the talent of de∣scription,
can too much be said in praise of Homer. Every thing is
alive in his writings. The colours with which he paints are those
of nature. But Ossian's genius was of a different kind from Homer's.
It led him to hurry towards grand objects rather than to amuse him∣self
with particulars of less importance. He could dwell on the
death of a favorite hero; but that of a private man seldom stopped
his rapid course. Homer's genius was more comprehensive than
Ossian's. It included a wider circle of objects; and could work up
any incident into description. Ossian's was more limited; but
the region within which it chiefly exerted itself was the highest
of all, the region of the pathetic and sublime.</P>
<P>We must not imagine, however, that Ossian's battles consist
only of general indistinct description. Such beautiful incidents are
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
sometimes introduced, and the circumstances of the persons slain
so much diversified, as show that he could have embellished his
military scenes with an abundant variety of particulars, if his genius
had led him to dwell upon them. One man “is stretched in the
dust of his native land; he fell, where often he had spread the
feast, and often raised the voice of the harp<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 28.</NOTE>.” The maid of
Inistore is introduced, in a moving apostrophe, as weeping for
another<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P 14.</NOTE>; and a third, “as rolled in the dust he lifted his
faint eyes to the king,” is remembered and mourned by Fingal
as the friend of Agandecca<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 59.</NOTE>. The blood pouring from the wound
of one who is slain by night, is heard “hissing on the half extinguished
oak,” which had been kindled for giving light: Another, climbing
a tree to escape from his foe, is pierced by his spear from behind;
“shrieking, panting he fell; whilst moss and withered branches
pursue his fall, and strew the blue arms of Gaul<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 236.</NOTE>.” Never
was a finer picture drawn of the ardour of two youthful warriors
than the following: “I saw Gaul in his armour, and my soul
was mixed with his: For the fire of the battle was in his eyes;
he looked to the foe with joy. We spoke the words of friend∣ship
in secret; and the lightening of our swords poured together.
We drew them behind the wood, and tried the strength of our
arms on the empty air<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 232.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Ossian is always concise in his descriptions, which adds much
to their beauty and force. For it is a great mistake to imagine, that
a crowd of particulars, or a very full and extended style, is of advan∣tage
of description. On the contrary, such a diffuse manner for the
most part weakens it. Any one redundant circumstance is a nui∣sance.
It encumbers and loads the fancy, and renders the main
image indistinct. “Obstat,” as Quintilian says with regard to
style, “quicquid non adjuvat.” To be concise in description, is
one thing; and to be general, is another. No description that rests
in generals can possibly be good; it can convey no lively idea; for
it is of particulars only that we have a distinct conception. But
at the same time, no strong imagination dwells long upon any one
particular; or heaps together a mass of trivial ones. By the happy
choice of some one, or of a few that are the most striking, it pre∣sents
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
the image more compleat, shows us more at one glance, than
a feeble imagination is able to do, by turning its object round and
round into a variety of lights. Tacitus is of all prose writers the
most concise. He has even a degree of abruptness resembling our
author: Yet no writer is more eminent for lively description.
When Fingal, after having conquered the haughty Swaran, proposes
to dismiss him with honour: “Raise to-morrow thy white sails to
the wind, thou brother of Agandecca!”<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 77.</NOTE> he conveys, by thus
addressing his enemy, a stronger impression of the emotions then
passing within his mind, than if whole paragraphs had been spent
in describing the conflict between resentment against Swaran and
the tender remembrance of his ancient love. No amplification is
needed to give us the most full idea of a hardy veteran, after the
few following words: “His shield is marked with the strokes of
battle; his red eye despises danger<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 174.</NOTE>.” When Oscar, left alone,
was surrounded by foes, “he stood,” it is said, “growing in his
place, like the flood of the narrow vale<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 102.</NOTE>;” a happy representa∣tion
of one, who, by daring intrepidity in the midst of danger, seems
to increase in his appearance, and becomes more formidable every
moment, like the sudden rising of the torrent hemmed in by the
valley. And a whole crowd of ideas, concerning the circumstances
of domestic sorrow occasioned by a young warrior's first going forth
to battle, is poured upon the mind by these words; “Calmar
leaned on his father's spear; that spear which he brought from
Lara's hall, when the soul of his mother was sad<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 40.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The conciseness of Ossian's descriptions is the more proper on
account of his subjects. Descriptions of gay and smiling scenes
may, without any disadvantage, be amplified and prolonged. Force is
not the predominant quality expected in these. The description
may be weakened by being diffuse, yet notwithstanding, may be
beautiful still. Whereas, with respect to grand, solemn and pa∣thetic
subjects, which are Ossian's chief field, the case is very dif∣ferent.
In these, energy is above all things required. The ima∣gination
must be seized at once, or not at all; and is far more
deeply impressed by one strong and ardent image, than by the an∣xious
minuteness of laboured illustration.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="51"/>
But Ossian's genius, though chiefly turned towards the sublime
and pathetic, was not confined to it: In subjects also of grace and
delicacy, he discovers the hand of a master. Take for an example
the following elegant description of Agandecca, wherein the ten∣derness
of Tibullus seems united with the majesty of Virgil.
“The daughter of the snow overheard, and left the hall of her
secret sigh. She came in all her beauty; like the moon from
the cloud of the East. Loveliness was around her as light. Her
steps were like the music of songs. She saw the youth and loved
him. He was the stolen sigh of her soul. Her blue eyes rolled
on him in secret: And she blest the chief of Morven<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE>.” Se∣veral
other instances might be produced of the feelings of love
and friendship painted by our author with a most natural and
happy delicacy.</P>
<P>The simplicity of Ossian's manner adds great beauty to his de∣scriptions,
and indeed to his whole Poetry. We meet with no af∣fected
ornaments; no forced refinement; no marks either in style
or thought of a studied endeavour to shine and sparkle. Ossian
appears every where to be prompted by his feelings; and to speak
from the abundance of his heart. I remember no more than one
instance of what can be called quaint thought in this whole col∣lection
of his works. It is in the first book of Fingal, where from
the tombs of two lovers two lonely yews are mentioned to have
sprung, “whose branches wished to meet on high<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE>.” This sym∣pathy
of the trees with the lovers, may be reckoned to border on
an Italian conceit; and it is somewhat curious to find this single
instance of that sort of wit in our Celtic poetry.</P>
<P>The “joy of grief,” is one of Ossian's peculiar expressions, se∣veral
times repeated. If any one shall think that it needs to be
justified by a precedent, he may find it twice used by Homer; in
the Iliad, when Achilles is visited by the ghost of Patroclus; and in
the Odyssey, when Ulysses meets his mother in the shades. On
both these occasions, the heroes, melted with tenderness, lament
their not having it in their power to throw their arms round the
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
ghost, “that we might,” say they, “in a mutual embrace, enjoy
the delight of grief.”</P>
<Q>—<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Odyss. 11. 211. Iliad 23. 98.</NOTE>.</Q>
<P>But in truth the expression stands in need of no defence from
authority; for it is a natural and just expression; and conveys a
clear idea of that gratification, which a virtuous heart often
feels in the indulgence of a tender melancholy. Ossian makes a
very proper distinction between this gratification, and the destructive
effect of overpowering grief. “There is a joy in grief, when peace
dwells in the breasts of the sad. But sorrow wastes the mournful,
O daughter of Toscar, and their days are few<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 250.</NOTE>.” To “give
the joy of grief,” generally signifies to raise the strain of soft and
grave musick; and finely characterises the taste of Ossian's age and
country. In those days, when the songs of bards were the great de∣light
of heroes, the tragic muse was held in chief honour; gallant
actions, and virtuous sufferings, were the chosen theme; preferably
to that light and trifling strain of poetry and musick, which pro∣motes
light and trifling manners, and serves to emasculate the mind.
“Strike the harp in my hall,” said the great Fingal, in the midst of
youth and victory. “Strike the harp in my hall, and let Fingal
hear the song. Pleasant is the joy of grief! It is like the shower
of spring, when it softens the branch of the oak; and the young
leaf lifts its green head. Sing on, O bards! To-morrow we lift
the sail<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Carric-thura, p. 193.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Personal epithets have been much used by all the poets of the most
ancient ages; and when well chosen, not general and unmeaning,
they contribute not a little to render the style descriptive and ani∣mated.
Besides epithets founded on bodily distinctions, akin to
many of Homer's, we find in Ossian several which are remarkably
beautiful and poetical. Such as, Oscar of the future fights, Fingal
of the mildest look, Carril of other times, the mildly blushing Evi∣rallin;
Bragela, the lonely sun-beam of Dunscaich; a Culdee, the
son of the secret cell.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53"/>
But of all the ornaments employed in descriptive poetry, compa∣risons
or similes are the most splendid. These chiefly form what is
called the imagery of a poem: And as they abound so much in the
works of Ossian, and are commonly among the favourite passages
of all poets, it may be expected that I should be somewhat particu∣lar
in my remarks upon them.</P>
<P>A poetical simile always supposes two objects brought together,
between which there is some near relation or connection in the
fancy. What that relation ought to be, cannot be precisely defined.
For various, almost numberless, are the analogies formed among ob∣jects,
by a sprightly imagination. The relation of actual similitude,
or likeness of appearance, is far from being the only foundation of
poetical comparison. Sometimes a resemblance in the effect pro∣duced
by two objects, is made the connecting principle: Sometimes
a resemblance in one distinguishing property or circumstance. Very
often two objects are brought together in a simile, though they re∣semble
one another, strictly speaking, in nothing, only because they
raise in the mind a train of similar, and what may be called, con∣cordant
ideas; so that the remembrance of the one, when recalled,
serves to quicken and heighten the impression made by the other.
Thus, to give an instance from our poet, the pleasure with which
an old man looks back on the exploits of his youth, has certainly no
direct resemblance to the beauty of a fine evening; farther than that
both agree in producing a certain calm, placid joy. Yet Ossian has
founded upon this, one of the most beautiful comparisons that is to
be met with in any poet. “Wilt thou not listen, son of the rock,
to the song of Ossian? My soul is full of other times; the joy of
my youth returns. Thus, the sun appears in the west, after the
steps of his brightness have moved behind a storm. The green
hills lift their dewy heads. The blue streams rejoice in the vale.
The aged hero comes forth on his staff; and his grey hair glitters
in the beam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 220.</NOTE>.” Never was there a finer group of objects. It
raises a strong conception of the old man's joy and elation of heart,
by displaying a scene, which produces in every spectator, a corres∣ponding
train of pleasing emotions; the declining sun looking forth
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
in his brightness after a storm; the chearful face of all nature; and
the still life finely animated by the circumstance of the aged hero,
with his staff and his grey locks; a circumstance both extremely pic∣turesque
in itself, and peculiarly suited to the main object of the
comparison. Such analogies and associations of ideas as these, are
highly pleasing to the fancy. They give opportunity for introdu∣cing
many a fine poetical picture. They diversify the scene; they
aggrandize the subject; they keep the imagination awake and
sprightly. For as the judgment is principally exercised in distin∣guishing
objects, and remarking the differences among those which
seem like; so the highest amusement of the imagination is to trace
likenesses and agreements among those which seem different.</P>
<P>The principal rules which respect poetical comparisons are, that
they be introduced on proper occasions, when the mind is disposed
to relish them; and not in the midst of some severe and agitating
passion, which cannot admit this play of fancy; that they be
founded on a resemblance neither too near and obvious, so as to give
little amusement to the imagination in tracing it, nor too faint and
remote, so as to be apprehended with difficulty; that they serve ei∣ther
to illustrate the principal object, and to render the conception
of it, more clear and distinct; or at least, to heighten and embellish
it, by a suitable association of images<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Elements of Criticism, ch. 19: vol. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Every country has a scenery peculiar to itself; and the imagery
of a good poet will exhibit it. For as he copies after nature, his
allusions will of course be taken from those objects which he sees
around him, and which have oftenest struck his fancy. For this
reason, in order to judge of the propriety of poetical imagery, we
ought to be, in some measure, acquainted with the natural history of
the country where the scene of the poem is laid. The introduction
of foreign images betrays a poet, copying not from nature, but from
other writers. Hence so many Lions, and Tygers, and Eagles and
Serpents, which we meet with in the similes of modern poets; as if
these animals had acquired some right to a place in poetical compa∣risons
for ever, because employed by ancient authors. They
employed them with propriety, as objects generally known in their
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
country; but they are absurdly used for illustration by us, who know
them only at second hand, or by description. To most readers of
modern poetry, it were more to the purpose to describe Lions or
Tygers by similes taken from men, than to compare men to Lions.
Ossian is very correct in this particular. His imagery is, without
exception, copied from that face of nature, which he saw before his
eyes; and by consequence may be expected to be lively. We meet
with no Grecian or Italian scenery; but with the mists, and clouds,
and storms of a northern mountainous region.</P>
<P>No poet abounds more in similes than Ossian. There are in this
collection as many, at least, as in the whole Iliad of Homer,
though that be a longer work. I am indeed inclined to think, that
the works of both poets are too much crowded with them. Similes
are sparkling ornaments; and like all things that sparkle, are apt to
dazzle and tire us by their lustre. But if Ossian's similes be too
frequent, they have this advantage of being commonly shorter than
Homer's; they interrupt his narration less; he just glances aside to
some resembling object, and instantly returns to his former track.
Homer's similes include a wider range of objects. But in return,
Ossian's are, without exception, taken from objects of dignity,
which cannot be said for all those which Homer employs. The
Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, Clouds and Meteors, Lightning and
Thunder, Seas and Whales, Rivers, Torrents, Winds, Rain, Snow,
Dews, Mist, Fire and Smoke, Trees and Torrents, Heath and Grass
and Flowers, Rocks and Mountains, Musick and Songs, Light and
Darkness, Spirits and Ghosts; these form the circle, within which
Ossian's comparisons generally run. Some, not many, are taken
from Birds and Beasts; as Eagles, Sea Fowl, the Horse, the Deer,
and the Mountain Bee; and a very few from such operations of art
as were then known. Homer has diversified his imagery by many
more allusions to the animal world; to Lions, Bulls, Goats,
Herds of Cattle, Serpents, Insects; and to the various occupations
of rural and pastoral life. Ossian's defect in this article, is plainly
owing to the desert, uncultivated state of his country, which sug∣gested
to him few images beyond natural inanimate objects, in their
rudest form. The birds and animals of the country were probably
not numerous; and his acquaintance with them was slender, as they
were little subjected to the uses of man.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56"/>
The great objection made to Ossian's imagery, is its uniformity,
and the too frequent repetition of the same comparisons. In a work
so thick sown with similes, one could not but expect to find images
of the same kind sometimes suggested to the poet by resembling ob∣jects;
especially to a poet like Ossian, who wrote from the imme∣diate
impulse of poetical enthusiasm, and without much preparation
of study or labour. Fertile as Homer's imagination is acknowledged
to be, who does not know how often his Lions and Bulls and
Flocks of Sheep, recur with little or no variation; nay, sometimes
in the very same words? The objection made to Ossian is, however,
founded, in a great measure, upon a mistake. It has been supposed
by inattentive readers, that wherever the Moon, the Cloud, or the
Thunder, returns in a simile, it is the same simile, and the same
Moon, or Cloud, or Thunder, which they had met with a few
pages before. Whereas very often the similes are widely different.
The object, whence they are taken, is indeed in substance the
same; but the image is new; for the appearance of the object is
changed; it is presented to the fancy in another attitude; and
cloathed with new circumstances, to make it suit the different illus∣tration
for which it is employed. In this, lies Ossian's great art; in so
happily varying the form of the few natural appearances with which
he was acquainted, as to make them correspond to a great many dif∣ferent
objects.</P>
<P>Let us take for one instance the Moon, which is very frequently
introduced into his comparisons; as in northern climates, where the
nights are long, the Moon is a greater object of attention, than in the
climate of Homer; and let us view how much our poet has diversi∣fied
its appearance. The shield of a warrior is like “the darkened
moon when it moves a dun circle through the heavens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 29.</NOTE>.” The
face of a ghost, wan and pale, is like “the beam of the setting
moon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 22.</NOTE>.” And a different appearance of a ghost, thin and in∣distinct,
is like “the new moon seen through the gathered mist,
when the sky pours down its flaky snow, and the world is silent
and dark<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 131.</NOTE>;” or in a different form still, it is like the watry beam
of the moon, when it rushes from between two clouds, and the
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
“midnight shower is on the field<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 119.</NOTE>.” A very opposite use is made
of the moon in the description of Agandecca: “She came in all her
beauty, like the moon from the cloud of the East<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 37.</NOTE>.” Hope,
succeeded by disappointment, is “joy rising on her face, and sorrow
returning again, like a thin cloud on the moon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 119.</NOTE>.” But when
Swaran, after his defeat, is cheared by Fingal's generosity, “His face
brightened like the full moon of heaven, when the clouds vanish
away, and leave her calm and broad in the midst of the sky<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 79.</NOTE>.”
Venvela is “bright as the moon when it trembles o'er the western
wave<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 195.</NOTE>;” but the soul of the guilty Uthal is “dark as the trou∣bled
face of the moon, when it foretels the storm<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 264.</NOTE>.” And by a
very fanciful and uncommon allusion, it is said of Cormac, who
was to die in his early years, “Nor long shalt thou lift the spear,
mildly shining beam of youth! Death stands dim behind thee,
like the darkened half of the moon behind its growing light<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P. 146.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Another instance of the same nature may be taken from mist,
which, as being a very familiar appearance in the country of Ossian,
he applies to a variety of purposes, and pursues through a great
many forms. Sometimes, which one would hardly expect, he em∣ploys
it to heighten the appearance of a beautiful object. The hair
of Morna is “like the mist of Cromla, when it curls on the rock,
and shines to the beam of the west<NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">P. 8.</NOTE>.”—“The song comes with its
musick to melt and please the ear. It is like soft mist, that rising
from a lake, pours on the silent vale. The green flowers are
filled with dew. The sun returns in its strength, and the mist is
gone<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">P. 215. There is a remarkable propriety in this comparison. It is in∣tended to explain the effect of soft and mournful musick. Armin appears dis∣turbed at a performance of this kind. Carmor says to him, “Why bursts the sigh of Armin? Is there a cause to mourn? The song comes with its musick to melt and please the ear. It is like soft mist, &amp;c.” that is, such mournful songs have a happy effect to soften the heart, and to improve it by tender emotions, as the moisture of the mist refreshes and nourishes the flowers; whilst the sadness they occasion is only transient, and soon dispelled by the suc∣ceeding occupations and amusements of life: “The sun returns in its strength, and the mist is gone.”</NOTE>—But, for the most part, mist is employed as a simili∣tude
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
of some disagreeable or terrible object. “The soul of Nathos
was sad, like the sun in the day of mist, when his face is watery
and dim<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 159.</NOTE>.” “The darkness of old age comes like the mist of
the desert<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 162.</NOTE>.” The face of a ghost is “pale as the mist of
Cromla<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 52.</NOTE>.” “The gloom of battle is rolled along as mist that
is poured on the valley, when storms invade the silent sun-shine
of heaven<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 27.</NOTE>.” Fame, suddenly departing, is likened to “mist
that flies away before the rustling wind of the vale<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 79.</NOTE>.” A ghost,
slowly vanishing, to “mist that melts by degrees on the sunny
hill<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 101.</NOTE>.” But of all the similes founded on mist, the most highly
finished, is that wherein Cairbar, after his treacherous assassination of
Oscar, is compared to a pestilential fog. “I love a foe like Cath∣mor,”
says Fingal, “his soul is great; his arm is strong; his
battles are full of fame. But the little soul is like a vapour that
hovers round the marshy lake. It never rises on the green hill,
lest the winds meet it there. Its dwelling is in the cave; and it
sends forth the dart of death<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">P. 189.</NOTE>.” These instances may sufficiently
shew with what richness of imagination Ossian's comparisons abound,
and at the same time, with what propriety of judgment they are
employed. If his field was narrow, it must be admitted to have
been as well cultivated as its extent would allow.</P>
<P>As it is usual to judge of poets from a comparison of their similes
more than of other passages, it will perhaps be agreeable to the
reader, to see how Homer and Ossian have conducted some images
of the same kind. This might be shewn in many instances. For
as the great objects of nature are common to the poets of all nations,
and make the general store-house of all imagery, the ground-work
of their comparisons must of course be frequently the same. I shall
select only a few of the most considerable from both poets. Mr.
Pope's translation of Homer can be of no use to us here. The pa∣rallel
is altogether unfair between prose, and the imposing harmony
of flowing numbers. It is only by viewing Homer in the simplicity
of a prose translation, that we can form any comparison between the
two bards.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
The shock of two encountering armies, the noise and the tumult
of battle, afford one of the most grand and awful subjects of de∣scription;
on which all Epic poets have exerted their strength. Let
us first hear Homer. The following description is a favourite one,
for we find it twice repeated in the same words<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iliad iv. 446. and Il. viii. 60.</NOTE>. “When now
the conflicting hosts joined in the field of battle, then were mu∣tually
opposed shields, and swords, and the strength of armed
men. The bossy bucklers were dashed against each other. The
universal tumult rose. There were mingled the triumphant shouts
and the dying groans of the victors and the vanquished. The
earth streamed with blood. As when winter torrents, rushing
from the mountains, pour into a narrow valley, their violent wa∣ters.
They issue from a thousand springs, and mix in the
hollowed channel. The distant shepherd hears on the mountain,
their roar from afar. Such was the terror and the shout of the
engaging armies.” In another passage, the poet, much in the
manner of Ossian, heaps simile on simile, to express the vastness of
the idea, with which his imagination seems to labour. “With a
mighty shout the hosts engage. Not so loud roars the wave of
ocean, when driven against the shore by the whole force of the
boisterous north; not so loud in the woods of the mountain, the
noise of the flame, when rising in its fury to consume the forest;
not so loud the wind among the lofty oaks, when the wrath of
the storm rages; as was the clamour of the Greeks and Tro∣jans,
when, roaring terrible, they rushed against each other<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Iliad xiv. 393.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>To these descriptions and similes, we may oppose the following
from Ossian, and leave the reader to judge between them. He will
find images of the same kind employed; commonly less extended;
but thrown forth with a glowing rapidity which characterises our
poet. “As autumn's dark storms pour from two echoing hills,
towards each other, approached the heroes. As two dark
streams from high rocks meet, and mix, and roar on the plain;
loud, rough, and dark in battle, meet Lochlin and Inisfail.
Chief mixed his strokes with chief, and man with man. Steel
clanging, sounded on steel. Helmets are cleft on high; blood
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
bursts and smoaks around.—As the troubled noise of the ocean,
when roll the waves on high; as the last peal of the thunder of
heaven, such is the noise of battle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 12.</NOTE>.—As roll a thousand waves
to the rock, so Swaran's host came on; as meets a rock a thou∣sand
waves, so Inisfail met Swaran. Death raises all his voices
around, and mixes with the sound of shields.—The field echoes
from wing to wing, as a hundred hammers that rise by turns on
the red son of the furnace<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 14.</NOTE>.—As a hundred winds on Mor∣ven;
as the streams of a hundred hills; as clouds fly successive
over heaven; or as the dark ocean assaults the shore of the de∣sart;
so roaring, so vast, so terrible, the armies mixed on Lena's
echoing heath<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 43</NOTE>.” In several of these images, there is a remark∣able
similarity to Homer's; but what follows is superior to any
comparison that Homer uses on this subject. “The groan of the
people spread over the hills; it was like the thunder of night,
when the cloud bursts on Cona; and a thousand ghosts shriek at
once on the hollow wind<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” Never was an image of more aw∣ful
sublimity employed to heighten the terror of battle.</P>
<P>Both poets compare the appearance of an army approaching, to
the gathering of dark clouds. “As when a shepherd,” says Ho∣mer,
“beholds from the rock, a cloud borne along the sea by the
western wind; black as pitch it appears from afar, sailing over
the ocean, and carrying the dreadful storm. He shrinks at the
sight, and drives his flock into the cave: Such, under the Ajaces,
moved on, the dark, the thickened phalanx to the war<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Iliad iv. 275.</NOTE>.”
—“They came,” says Ossian, “over the desert like stormy
clouds, when the winds roll them over the heath; their edges
are tinged with lightening; and the echoing groves foresee the
storm<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 109.</NOTE>.” The edges of the cloud tinged with lightning, is a
sublime idea; but the shepherd and his flock, render Homer's simile
more picturesque. This is frequently the difference between the
two poets. Ossian gives no more than the main image, strong and
full. Homer adds circumstances and appendages, which amuse the
fancy by enlivening the scenery.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61"/>
Homer compares the regular appearance of an army, to “clouds
that are settled on the mountain top, in the day of calmness,
when the strength of the north wind sleeps<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Iliad, v. 522.</NOTE>.” Ossian, with full
as much propriety, compares the appearance of a disordered army,
to “the mountain cloud, when the blast hath entered its womb;
and scatters the curling gloom on every side<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 224.</NOTE>. Ossian's clouds
assume a great many forms; and, as we might expect from his cli∣mate,
are a fertile source of imagery to him. “The warriors fol∣lowed
their chiefs, like the gathering of the rainy clouds, behind
the red meteors of heaven<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 4.</NOTE>.” An army retreating without
coming to action, is likened to “clouds, that having long
threatened rain, retire slowly behind the hills<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 166.</NOTE>.” The picture
of Oithona, after she had determined to die, is lively and delicate.
“Her soul was resolved, and the tear was dried from her wildly-looking
eye. A troubled joy rose on her mind, like the red path
of the lightning on a stormy cloud<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 246.</NOTE>.” The image also of the
gloomy Cairbar, meditating, in silence, the assassination of Oscar,
until the moment came when his designs were ripe for execution, is
extremely noble, and complete in all its parts. “Cairbar heard
their words in silence, like the cloud of a shower; it stands dark
on Cromla, till the lightning bursts its side. The valley gleams
with red light; the spirits of the storm rejoice. So stood the
silent king of Temora; at length his words are heard<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 176.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Homer's comparison of Achilles to the Dog-Star, is very sublime.
“Priam beheld him rushing along the plain, shining in his armour,
like the star of autumn; bright are its beams, distinguished
amidst the multitude of stars in the dark hour of night. It rises
in its splendor; but its splendor is fatal; betokening to miserable
men, the destroying heat<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Iliad, xxii. 26.</NOTE>.” The first appearance of Fingal,
is, in like manner, compared by Ossian, to a star or meteor.
“Fingal, tall in his ship, stretched his bright lance before him.
Terrible was the gleam of his steel; it was like the green meteor
of death, setting in the health of Malmor, when the traveller is alone,
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
and the broad moon is darkened in heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 41.</NOTE>.” The hero's ap∣pearance
in Homer, is more magnificent; in Ossian, more terrible.</P>
<P>A tree cut down, or overthrown by a storm, is a similitude fre∣quent
among poets for describing the fall of a warrior in battle.
Homer employs it often. But the most beautiful, by far, of his
comparisons, founded on this object, indeed one of the most beau∣tiful
in the whole Iliad, is that on the death of Euphorbus. “As
the young and verdant olive, which a man hath reared with care
in a lonely field, where the springs of water bubble around it; it
is fair and flourishing; it is fanned by the breath of all the
winds, and loaded with white blossoms; when the sudden blast
of a whirlwind descending, roots it out from its bed, and stretches
it on the dust<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Iliad xvii. 53.</NOTE>.” To this, elegant as it is, we may oppose the
following simile of Ossian's, relating to the death of the three sons
of Usnoth. “They fell, like three young oaks which stood alone
on the hill. The traveller saw the lovely trees, and wondered
how they grew so lonely. The blast of the desert came by night,
and laid their green heads low. Next day he returned; but they
were withered, and the heath was bare<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 170.</NOTE>.” Malvina's allusion to
the same object, in her lamentation over Oscar, is so exquisitely
tender, that I cannot forbear giving it a place also. “I was a
lovely tree in thy presence, Oscar! with all my branches round
me. But thy death came, like a blast from the desert, and laid
my green head low. The spring returned with its showers; but
no leaf of mine arose<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 250.</NOTE>.” Several of Ossian's similes taken from
trees, are remarkably beautiful, and diversified with well chosen
circumstances; such as that upon the death of Ryno and Orla:
“They have fallen like the oak of the desert; when it lies across a
stream, and withers in the wind of the mountains<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 70.</NOTE>:” Or that which
Ossian applies to himself; “I, like an ancient oak in Morven, moul∣der
alone in my place; the blast hath lopped my branches away;
and I tremble at the wings of the north<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 191.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>As Homer exalts his heroes by comparing them to gods, Ossian
makes the same use of comparisons taken from spirits and ghosts.
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
Swaran “roared in battle, like the shrill spirit of a storm that sits
dim on the clouds of Gormal, and enjoys the death of the ma∣riner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 13.</NOTE>.”
His people gathered around Erragon, “like storms
around the ghost of night, when he calls them from the top of
Morven, and prepares to pour them on the land of the stran∣ger
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 114.</NOTE>.”—“They fell before my son, like groves in the desert,
when an angry ghost rushes through night, and takes their green
heads in his hand<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 180.</NOTE>.” In such images, Ossian appears in his
strength; for very seldom have supernatural beings been painted
with so much sublimity, and such force of imagination, as by this
poet. Even Homer, great as he is, must yield to him in similes
formed upon these. Take, for instance, the following, which is
the most remarkable of this kind in the Iliad. “Meriones followed
Idomeneus to battle, like Mars the destroyer of men, when he
rushes to war. Terror, his beloved son, strong and fierce, at∣tends
him; who fills with dismay, the most valiant hero. They
come from Thrace, armed against the Ephyrians and Phlegyans;
nor do they regard the prayers of either; but dispose of success at
their will<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Iliad xiii. 298.</NOTE>.” The idea here, is undoubtedly noble: But observe
what a figure Ossian sets before the astonished imagination, and with
what sublimely terrible circumstances he has heightened it. “He
rushed in the sound of his arms, like the dreadful spirit of Loda,
when he comes in the roar of a thousand storms, and scatters
battles from his eyes. He sits on a cloud over Lochlin's seas.
His mighty hand is on his sword. The winds lift his flaming
locks. So terrible was Cuchullin in the day of his fame<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 151.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Homer's comparisons relate chiefly to martial subjects, to the ap∣pearances
and motions of armies, the engagement and death of he∣roes,
and the various incidents of war. In Ossian, we find a greater
variety of other subjects illustrated by similes; particularly, the
songs of bards, the beauty of women, the differnt circumstances
of old age, sorrow, and private distress; which give occasion
to much beautiful imagery. What, for instance, can be more
delicate and moving, than the following simile of Oithona's,
in her lamentation over the dishonour she had suffered? “Chief of
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
Strumon, replied the sighing maid, why didst thou come over
the dark blue wave to Nuath's mournful daughter? Why did not
I pass away in secret, like the flower of the rock, that lifts its
fair head unseen, and strews its withered leaves on the blast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 244.</NOTE>?”
The musick of bards, a favourite object with Ossian, is illustrated
by a variety of the most beautiful appearances that are to be found in
nature. It is compared to the calm shower of spring; to the dews
of the morning on the hill of roes; to the face of the blue and still
lake<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. p. 215, 18, 35, 194.</NOTE>. Two similes on this subject, I shall quote, because they
would do honour to any of the most celebrated classics. The one
is; “Sit thou on the heath, O bard! and let us hear thy voice;
it is pleasant as the gale of the spring that sighs on the hunter's
ear, when he wakens from dreams of joy, and has heard the
music of the spirits of the hill<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 72.</NOTE>.” The other contains a short,
but exquisitely tender image, accompanied with the finest poetical
painting. “The music of Carryl was like the memory of joys
that are past, pleasant and mournful to the soul. The ghosts of
departed bards heard it from Slimora's side. Soft sounds spread
along the wood; and the silent valleys of night rejoice<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 147.</NOTE>.” What
a figure would such imagery and such scenery have made, had they
been presented to us, adorned with the sweetness and harmony of
the Virgilian numbers!</P>
<P>I have chosen all along to compare Ossian with Homer, rather
than Virgil, for an obvious reason. There is a much nearer corres∣pondence
between the times and manners of the two former poets.
Both wrote in an early period of society; both are originals; both
are distinguished by simplicity, sublimity, and fire. The correct
elegance of Virgil, his artful imitation of Homer, the Roman state∣liness
which he every where maintains, admit no parallel with the
abrupt boldness, and enthusiastick warmth of the Celtic bard. In
one article, indeed, there is a resemblance. Virgil is more tender
than Homer; and thereby agrees more with Ossian; with this dif∣ference,
that the feelings of the one are more gentle and polished,
those of the other, more strong; the tenderness of Virgil softens,
that of Ossian dissolves and overcomes the heart.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="65"/>
A resemblance may be sometimes observed between Ossian's com∣parisons,
and those employed by the sacred writers. They abound
much in this figure, and they use it with the utmost propriety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Lowth de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum.</NOTE>.
The imagery of Scripture exhibits a soil and climate altogether dif∣ferent
from those of Ossian; a warmer country, a more smiling
face of nature, the arts of agriculture and of rural life much farther
advanced. The wine press, and the threshing floor, are often pre∣sented
to us, the Cedar and the Palm-tree, the fragrance of per∣fumes,
the voice of the Turtle, and the beds of Lillies. The
similes are, like Ossian's, generally short, touching on one point of
resemblance, rather than spread out into little episodes. In the fol∣lowing
example, may be perceived what inexpressible grandeur
poetry receives from the intervention of the Deity. “The nations
shall rush like the rushings of many waters; but God shall re∣buke
them, and they shall fly far off, and shall be chased as
the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like the down of
the thistle before the whirlwind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xvii. 13.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Besides formal comparisons, the poetry of Ossian is embellished
with many beautiful metaphors: Such as that remarkably fine one
applied to Deugala; “She was covered with the light of beauty;
but her heart was the house of pride<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 31.</NOTE>.” This mode of expres∣sion,
which suppresses the mark of comparison, and substitutes a
figured description in room of the object described, is a great en∣livener
of style. It denotes that glow and rapidity of fancy, which
without pausing to form a regular simile, paints the object at one
stroke. “Thou art to me the beam of the east, rising in a land
unknown<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 244.</NOTE>.”—“In peace, thou art the gale of spring; in war,
the mountain storm<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">P. 78.</NOTE>.”—“Pleasant be thy rest, O lovely beam,
soon hast thou set on our hills! The steps of thy departure were
stately, like the moon on the blue trembling wave. But thou
hast left us in darkness, first of the maids of Lutha!—Soon hast
thou set Malvina! but thou risest, like the beam of the east,
among the spirits of thy friends, where they sit in their stormy
halls, the chambers of the thunder<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">P. 259.</NOTE>.” This is correct and
finely supported. But in the following instance, the metaphor,
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
though very beautiful at the beginning, becomes imperfect before it
closes, by being improperly mixed with the literal sense. “Trothal
went forth with the stream of his people; but they met a rock;
Fingal stood unmoved; broken they rolled back from his side.
Nor did they roll in safety; the spear of the king pursued their
flight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 202.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The hyperbole is a figure which we might expect to find often
employed by Ossian; as the undisciplined imagination of early ages
generally prompts exaggeration, and carries its objects to excess;
whereas longer experience, and farther progress in the arts of life,
chasten mens ideas and expressions. Yet Ossian's hyperboles appear
not to me, either so frequent or so harsh as might at first have been
looked for; an advantage owing no doubt to the more cultivated state,
in which, as was before shewn, poetry subsisted among the ancient
Celtae, than among most other barbarous nations. One of the most
exaggerated descriptions in the whole work, is what meets us at the
beginning of Fingal, where the scout makes his report to Cuchullin
of the landing of the foe. But this is so far from deserving censure,
that it merits praise, as being, on that occasion, natural and proper.
The scout arrives, trembling and full of fears; and it is well known,
that no passion disposes men to hyperbolize more than terror. It
both annihilates themselves in their own apprehension, and mag∣nifies
every object which they view through the medium of a
troubled imagination. Hence all those indistinct images of formidable
greatness, the natural marks of a disturbed and confused mind,
which occur in Moran's description of Swaran's appearance, and in
his relation of the conference which they held together; not unlike
the report, which the affrighted Jewish spies made to their leader of
the land of Canaan. “The land through which we have gone to
search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and
all the people that we saw in it, are men of a great stature: and
there saw we giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the giants;
and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so were we
in their sight<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Numbers xiii. 32, 33.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="67"/>
With regard to personifications, I formerly observed that Ossian
was sparing, and I accounted for his being so. Allegorica per∣sonages
he has none; and their absence is not to be regretted. For
the intermixture of those shadowy Beings, which have not the sup∣port
even of mythological or legendary belief, with human actors,
seldom produces a good effect. The fiction becomes too visible and
phantastick; and overthrows that impression of reality, which the
probable recital of human actions is calculated to make upon the
mind. In the serious and pathetick scenes of Ossian especially, allego∣rical
characters would have been as much out of place, as in Tra∣gedy;
serving only unseasonably to amuse the fancy, whilst they
stopped the current, and weakened the force of passion.</P>
<P>With apostrophes, or addresses to persons absent or dead, which
have been, in all ages, the language of passion, our poet abounds;
and they are among his highest beauties. Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness the apostrophe,
in the first book of Fingal, to the maid of Inistore, whose lover had
fallen in battle; and that inimitably fine one of Cuchullin to Bra∣gela
at the conclusion of the same book. He commands the harp
to be struck in her praise; and the mention of Bragela's name, im∣mediately
suggesting to him a crowd of tender ideas; “Dost thou
raise thy fair face from the rocks,” he exclaims, “to find the
sails of Cuchullin? The sea is rolling far distant, and its white
foam shall deceive thee for my sails.” And now his imagination
being wrought up to conceive her as, at that moment, really in this
situation, he becomes afraid of the harm she may receive from the
inclemency of the night; and with an enthusiasm, happy and af∣fecting,
though beyond the cautious strain of modern poetry, “Re∣tire,”
he proceeds, “retire, for it is night, my love, and the
dark winds sigh in thy hair. Retire to the hall of my feasts, and
think of the times that are past; for I will not return till the storm
of war has ceased. O Connal, speak of wars and arms, and send
her from my mind; for lovely with her raven hair is the white-bosomed
daughter of Sorglan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 18.</NOTE>.” This breathes all the native
spirit of passion and tenderness.</P>
<P>The addresses to the sun<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 141.</NOTE>, to the moon<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 155.</NOTE>, and to the evening
star<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 209.</NOTE>, must draw the attention of every reader of taste, as among
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
the most splendid ornaments of this collection. The beauties of
each are too great, and too obvious to need any particular comment.
In one passage only of the address to the moon, there appears some
obscurity. “Whither dost thou retire from thy course, when the
darkness of thy countenance grows? Hast thou thy hall like
Ossian? Dwellest thou in the shadow of grief? Have thy sisters
fallen from heaven? Are they who rejoiced with thee at night,
no more? Yes, they have fallen, fair light! and thou dost often
retire to mourn.” We may be at a loss to comprehend, at first
view, the ground of these speculations of Ossian, concerning the
moon; but when all the circumstances are attended to, they will
appear to flow naturally from the present situation of his mind. A
mind under the dominion of any strong passion, tinctures with its
own disposition, every object which it beholds. The old bard, with
his heart bleeding for the loss of all his friends, is meditating on the
different phases of the moon. Her waning and darkness, presents
to his melancholy imagination, the image of sorrow; and presently
the idea arises, and is indulged, that, like himself, she retires to
mourn over the loss of other moons, or of stars, whom he calls her
sisters, and fancies to have once rejoiced with her at night, now
fallen from heaven. Darkness suggested the idea of mourning; and
mourning suggested nothing so naturally to Ossian, as the death of
beloved friends. An instance precisely similar of this influence of
passion, may be seen in a passage which has always been admired
of Shakespear's King Lear. The old man on the point of distraction,
through the inhumanity of his daughters, sees Edgar appear dis∣guised
like a beggar and a madman.</P>

The apostrophe to the winds, in the opening of Darthula, is in
the highest spirit of poetry. “But the winds deceive thee, O
Darthula! and deny the woody Etha to thy sails. These are
not thy mountains, Nathos, nor is that the roar of thy climbing
waves. The halls of Cairbar are near, and the towers of the
foe lift their head.—Where have ye been, ye southern winds;
when the sons of my love were deceived? But ye have been
sporting on plains, and pursuing the thistle's beard. O that ye
had been rustling in the sails of Nathos, till the hills of Etha
rose! till they rose in their clouds, and saw their coming
chief<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 157.</NOTE>!” This passage is remarkable for the resemblance it
bears to an expostulation with the wood nymphs, on their absence at
a critical time; which, as a favourite poetical idea, Virgil has co∣pied
from Theocritus, and Milton has very happily imitated from
both.</P>

<P>Having now treated fully of Ossian's talents, with respect to de∣scription
and imagery, it only remains to make some observations on
his sentiments. No sentiments can be beautiful without being pro∣per;
that is, suited to the character and situation of those who utter
them. In this respect, Ossian is as correct as most writers. His
characters, as above observed, are in general well supported; which
could not have been the case, had the sentiments been unnatural
or out of place. A variety of personages of different ages, sexes, and
conditions, are introduced into his poems; and they speak and act
with a propriety of sentiment and behaviour, which it is surprising
to find in so rude an age. Let the poem of Darthula, throughout,
be taken as an example.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70"/>
But it is not enough that sentiments be natural and proper. In
order to acquire any high degree of poetical merit, they must also be
sublime and pathetick.</P>
<P>The sublime is not confined to sentiment alone. It belongs to de∣scription
also; and whether in description or in sentiment, imports
such ideas presented to the mind, as raise it to an uncommon degree
of elevation, and fill it with admiration and astonishment. This is
the highest effect either of eloquence or poetry: And to produce
this effect, requires a genius glowing with the strongest and warmest
conception of some object awful, great or magnificent. That this
character of genius belongs to Ossian, may, I think, sufficiently ap∣pear
from many of the passages I have already had occasion to quote.
To produce more instances, were superfluous. If the engagement
of Fingal with the spirit of Loda, in Carric-thura; if the encoun∣ters
of the armies, in Fingal; if the address to the sun, in Carthon;
if the similes founded upon ghosts and spirits of the night, all for∣merly
mentioned, be not admitted as examples, and illustrious ones
too, of the true poetical sublime, I confess myself entirely ignorant
of this quality in writing.</P>
<P>All the circumstances, indeed, of Ossian's composition, are fa∣vourable
to the sublime, more perhaps than to any other species of
beauty. Accuracy and correctness; artfully connected narration;
exact method and proportion of parts, we may look for in polished
times. The gay and the beautiful, will appear to more advantage
in the midst of smiling scenery and pleasurable themes. But amidst
the rude scenes of nature, amidst rocks and torrents and whirlwinds
and battles, dwells the sublime. It is the thunder and the lightning
of genius. It is the offspring of nature, not of art. It is negligent
of all the lesser graces, and perfectly consistent with a certain noble
disorder. It associates naturally with that grave and solemn spirit,
which distinguishes our author. For the sublime, is an awful and
serious emotion; and is heightened by all the images of Trouble,
and Terror, and Darkness.</P>

<P>Simplicity and conciseness, are never-failing characteristics of the
stile of a sublime writer. He rests on the majesty of his sentiments,
not on the pomp of his expressions. The main secret of being
sublime, is to say great things in few, and in plain words: For
every superfluous decoration degrades a sublime idea. The mind
rises and swells, when a lofty description or sentiment is presented to
it, in its native form. But no sooner does the poet attempt to spread
out this sentiment or description, and to deck it round and round
with glittering ornaments, than the mind begins to fall from its
high elevation; the transport is over; the beautiful may remain,
but the sublime is gone. Hence the concise and simple style of
Ossian, gives great advantage to his sublime conceptions; and assists
them in seizing the imagination with full power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The noted saying of Julius Caesar, to the pilot in a storm; “Quid times? Caesarem vehis;” is magnanimous and sublime. Lucan, not satisfied with this simple conciseness, resolved to amplify and improve the thought. Observe, how every time he twists it round, it departs farther from the sublime, till at last, it end in tumid declamation.

<P>Sublimity as belonging to sentiment, coincides in a great measure
with magnanimity, heroism, and generosity of sentiment. What∣ever
discovers human nature in its greatest elevation; whatever be∣speaks
a high effort of soul; or shews a mind superior to pleasures,
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
to dangers, and to death, forms what may be called the moral or
sentimental sublime. For this, Ossian is eminently distinguished.
No poet maintains a higher tone of virtuous and noble senti∣ment,
throughout all his works. Particularly in all the sen∣timents
of Fingal, there is a grandeur and loftiness proper to swell
the mind with the highest ideas of human perfection. Wherever
he appears, we behold the hero. The objects which he pursues,
are always truly great; to bend the proud; to protect the injured;
to defend his friends; to overcome his enemies by generosity more
than by force. A portion of the same spirit actuates all the other
heroes. Valour reigns; but it is a generous valour, void of cruelty,
animated by honour, not by hatred. We behold no debasing pas∣sions
among Fingal's warriors; no spirit of avarice or of insult;
but a perpetual contention for fame; a desire of being distinguished
and remembered for gallant actions; a love of justice; and a zea∣lous
attachment to their friends and their country. Such is the
strain of sentiment in the works of Ossian.</P>
<P>But the sublimity of moral sentiments, if they wanted the soften∣ing
of the tender, would be an hazard of giving a hard and stiff
air to poetry. It is not enough to admire. Admiration is a cold
feeling, in comparison of that deep interest, which the heart takes
in tender and pathetick scenes; where, by a mysterious attachment
to the objects of compassion, we are pleased and delighted, even
whilst we mourn. With scenes of this kind, Ossian abounds; and
his high merit in these, is incontestable. He may be blamed for
drawing tears too often from our eyes; but that he has the power
of commanding them, I believe no man, who has the least sensibi∣lity,
will question. The general character of his poetry, is the he∣roic
mixed with the elegiac strain; admiration tempered with
pity. Ever fond of giving, as he expresses it, “the joy of grief,”
it is visible, that on all moving subjects, he delights to exert his ge∣nius;
and accordingly, never were there finer pathetick situations,
than what his works present. His great art in managing them, lies
in giving vent to the simple and natural emotions of the heart. We
meet with no exaggerated declamation; no subtile refinements on
sorrow; no substitution of description in place of passion. Ossian
felt strongly himself; and the heart when uttering its native lan∣guage
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
never fails, by powerful sympathy, to affect the heart. A
great variety of examples might be produced. We need only open
the book to find them every where. What, for instance, can be
more moving, than the lamentations of Oithona, after her misfor∣tune?
Gaul, the son of Morni, her lover, ignorant of what she had
suffered, comes to her rescue. Their meeting is tender in the
highest degree. He proposes to engage her foe, in single combat,
and gives her in charge what she is to do, if he himself shall fall.
“And shall the daughter of Nuäth live, she replied with a bursting
sigh? Shall I live in Tromathon, and the son of Morni low?
My heart is not of that rock; nor my soul careless as that sea,
which lifts its blue waves to every wind, and rolls beneath the
storm. The blast, which shall lay thee low, shall spread the
branches of Oithona on earth. We shall wither together, son of
car-borne Morni! The narrow house is pleasant to me; and the
grey stone of the dead; for never more will I leave thy rocks, sea-surrounded
Tromathon!—Chief of Strumon, why camest thou
over the waves to Nuäth's mournful daughter? Why did not I
pass away in secret, like the flower of the rock, that lifts its fair
head unseen, and strews its withered leaves on the blast? Why
didst thou come, O Gaul! to hear my departing sigh?—O had
I dwelt at Duvranna, in the bright beams of my fame! Then
had my years come on with joy; and the virgins would bless my
steps. But I fall in youth, son of Morni, and my father shall
blush in his hall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 244, 245, 248.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Oithona mourns like a woman; in Cuchullin's expressions of
grief after his defeat, we behold the sentiments of a hero, generous
but desponding. The situation is remarkably fine. Cuchullin,
rouzed from his cave, by the noise of battle, sees Fingal victorious
in the field. He is described as kindling at the sight. “His hand
is on the sword of his fathers; his red-rolling eyes on the foe.
He thrice attempted to rush to battle; and thrice did Connal stop
him;” suggesting, that Fingal was routing the foe; and that he
ought not by the show of superfluous aid, to deprive the king of any
part of the honour of a victory, which was owing to him alone.
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Cuchullin yields to this generous sentiment; but we see it stinging
him to the heart with the sense of his own disgrace. “Then,
Carril, go, replied the chief, and greet the king of Morven.
When Lochlin falls away like a stream after rain, and the noise
of the battle is over. Then be thy voice sweet in his ear, to
praise the king of swords. Give him the sword of Caithbat; for
Cuchullin is worthy no more to lift the arms of his fathers. But,
O ye ghosts of the lonely Cromla! Ye souls of chiefs that are no
more! Be ye the companions of Cuchullin, and talk to him in
the cave of his sorrow. For never more shall I be renowned
among the mighty in the land. I am like a beam that has shone:
Like a mist that has fled away; when the blast of the morning
came, and brightened the shaggy side of the hill. Connal! Talk
of arms no more: Departed is my fame. My sighs shall be on
Cromla's wind; till my footsteps cease to be seen. And thou,
white-bosomed Bragela! mourn over the fall of my fame; for
vanquished, I will never return to thee, thou sun-beam of Dun∣scaich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 60.</NOTE>!</P>
<Q><L>—Aestuat Ingens</L>
<L>Uno in corde pudor, luctusque, &amp; conscia virtus.</L></Q>
<P>Besides such extended pathetick scenes, Ossian frequently pierces
the heart by a single unexpected stroke. When Oscar fell in battle,
“No father mourned his son slain in youth; no brother, his bro∣ther
of love; they fell without tears, for the chief of the people
was low<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 182.</NOTE>.” In the admirable interview of Hector with An∣dromache,
in the sixth Iliad, the circumstance of the child in his
nurse's arms, has often been remarked, as adding much to the ten∣derness
of the scene. In the following passage relating to the death
of Cuchullin, we find a circumstance that must strike the imagina∣tion
with still greater force. “And is the son of Semo fallen?
said Carril with a sigh. Mournful are Tura's walls, and sorrow
dwells at Dunscaich. Thy spouse is left alone in her youth; the
son of thy love is alone. He shall come to Bragela, and ask her
why she weeps. He shall lift his eyes to the wall, and see his
father's sword. Whose sword is that? he will say; and the
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
soul of his mother is sad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 152. the voice of Cona.</NOTE>.” Soon after Fingal had shewn all the
grief of a father's heart for Ryno, one of his sons, fallen in battle,
he is calling, after his accustomed manner, his sons to the chace.
“Call,” says he, “Fillan and Ryno—But he is not here—My
son rests on the bed of death<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. 81.</NOTE>.”—This unexpected start of an∣guish,
is worthy of the highest tragic poet,
<Q><L>If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife—</L>
<L>My wife! my wife—What wife?—I have no wife—</L>
<L>Oh insupportable! Oh heavy hour!</L>
<BIBL>Othello, Act. 5. Scene 7.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>The contrivance of the incident in both poets is similar; but the
circumstances are varied with judgment. Othello dwells upon the
name of wife, when it had fallen from him, with the confusion
and horror of one tortured with guilt. Fingal, with the dignity of
a hero, corrects himself, and suppresses his rising grief.</P>
<P>The contrast which Ossian frequently makes between his present
and his former state, diffuses over his whole poetry, a solemn pathe∣tick
air, which cannot fail to make impression on every heart. The
conclusion of the songs of Selma, is particularly calculated for this
purpose. Nothing can be more poetical and tender, or can leave
upon the mind, a stronger, and more affecting idea of the venerable
aged bard. “Such were the words of the bards in the days of the
song; when the king heard the music of harps, and the tales of
other times. The chiefs gathered from all their hills, and heard
the lovely sound. They praised the voice of Cona<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ossian himself is poetically called</NOTE>; the first
among a thousand bards. But age is now on my tongue, and my
soul has failed. I hear, sometimes, the ghosts of bards, and learn
their pleasant song. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the
call of years. They say, as they pass along; why does Ossian
sing? Soon shall he lie in the narrow house, and no bard shall
raise his fame. Roll on, ye dark-brown years! for ye bring no
joy in your course. Let the tomb open to Ossian, for his strength
has failed. The sons of the song are gone to rest. My voice re∣mains,
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
like a blast, that roars lonely on a sea-surrounded rock, af∣ter
the winds are laid. The dark moss whistles there, and the
distant mariner sees the waving trees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 217.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Upon the whole; if to feel strongly, and to describe naturally,
be the two chief ingredients in poetical genius, Ossian must, after
fair examination, be held to possess that genius in a high degree.
The question is not, whether a few improprieties may be
pointed out in his works; whether this, or that passage, might
not have been worked up with more art and skill, by some
writer of happier times? A thousand such cold and frivolous
criticisms, are altogether indecisive as to his genuine merit.
But, has he the spirit, the fire, the inspiration of a poet? Does he
utter the voice of nature? Does he elevate by his sentiments? Does
he interest by his descriptions? Does he paint to the heart as well as
to the fancy? Does he make his readers glow, and tremble, and
weep? These are the great charasteristicks of true poetry. Where
these are found, he must be a minute critic indeed, who can dwell
upon slight defects. A few beauties of this high kind, transcend
whole volumes of faultless mediocrity. Uncouth and abrupt,
Ossian may sometimes appear by reason of his conciseness. But he is
sublime, he is pathetick, in an eminent degree. If he has not the
extensive knowledge, the regular dignity of narration, the fulness
and accuracy of description, which we find in Homer and Virgil,
yet in strength of imagination, in grandeur of sentiment, in native
majesty of passion, he is fully their equal. If he flows not always
like a clear stream, yet he breaks forth often like a torrent of fire. Of
art too, he is far from being destitute; and his imagination is re∣markable
for delicacy as well as strength. Seldom or never is he ei∣ther
trifling or tedious; and if he be thought too melancholy, yet he
is always moral. Though his merit were in other respects much less
than it is, this alone ought to entitle him to high regard, that his
writings are remarkably favourable to virtue. They awake the ten∣derest
sympathies, and inspire the most generous emotions. No
reader can rise from him, without being warmed with the senti∣ments
of humanity, virtue and honour.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
Though unacquainted with the original language, there is no one
but must judge the translation to deserve the highest praise, on ac∣count
of its beauty and elegance. Of its faithfulness and accuracy,
I have been assured by persons skilled in the Galic tongue, who
from their youth, were acquainted with many of these poems of
Ossian. To transfuse such spirited and fervid ideas from one lan∣guage
into another; to translate literally, and yet with such a glow
of poetry; to keep alive so much passion, and support so much
dignity throughout, is one of the most difficult works of genius,
and proves the translator to have been animated with no small por∣tion
of Ossian's spirit.</P>
<P>The measured prose which he has employed, possesses consider∣able
advantages above any sort of versification he could have chosen.
Whilst it pleases and fills the ear with a variety of harmonious ca∣dences,
being, at the same time, freer from constraint in the choice
and arrangement of words, it allows the spirit of the original to be
exhibited with more justness, force, and simplicity. Elegant how∣ever,
and masterly as Mr. Macpherson's translation is, we must
never forget, whilst we read it, that we are putting the merit of
the original to a severe test. For, we are examining a poet,
stripped of his native dress; divested of the harmony of his own
numbers. We know how much grace and energy the works of the
Greek and Latin poets receive from the charm of versification in
their original languages. If then, destitute of this advantage, ex∣hibited
in a literal version, Ossian still has power to please as a poet;
and not to please only, but often to command, to transport, to melt
the heart; we may very safely infer, that his productions are the
offspring of true and uncommon genius; and we may boldly
assign him a place among those, whose works are to last for ages.</P>
