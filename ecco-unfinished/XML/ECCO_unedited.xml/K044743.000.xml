<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXXII. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>They shall prosper that love Thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Psalm was composed by holy <HI>David,</HI> for the Use of the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> when they went up to <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> to worship at the appointed Solem∣nities: And the Design of it was to inspire them with a Regard and Love for their Coun∣try. His principal Care therefore was to consider what Means would be most effectual to this Purpose; and his Wisdom and Experi∣ence soon led him to observe, that nothing was so likely to raise this public Spirit, as a Pro∣mise of Prosperity; a Motive which would have great Influence on the human Mind, and, more particularly, among a People who were intently fixed on the Enjoyment of temporal Happiness.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<P>The Love which a Man bears to the Coun∣try wherein he was born is an universal Prin∣ciple, which was, no Doubt, implanted in the human Breast, by the all-wise Creator, as an Incentive to great and good Actions; and in∣deed the Effects of it have been such as a Principle less extensive could never have pro∣duced.</P>
<P>History will furnish us with numberless Ex∣amples of this Truth, but happy is it for us that we need not look farther than our own Age and Nation.</P>
<P>All Men are born with this exalted Prin∣ciple; it is stamp'd upon every Heart: But to be in a Situation that may make it of great and signal Service is the Lot only of a Few: The common People feel it very strongly; but cannot, as Individuals, make it of any material Advantage. In Persons of Rank, and with Abilities equal to their Rank, it may have its utmost Scope; nor can they, at any Time, forget the Duty which it pre∣scribes,
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>without making themselves the Objects of perpetual Disgrace.</P>
<P>This perhaps may be more clearly under∣stood, by pointing out an Instance or two, in which this great Principle, THE LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY, may be exerted.</P>
<P>He, who is bless'd with superior Talents, and in a proper Situation to exert them, will give the furest Proof of his Patriotism, by the Re∣verence which he pays to the Religion of his Country; and this not only by assenting in ge∣neral to the Doctrines of it, but by a strict Observance of the Duties which it prescribes. Piety gives the best Lustre to Greatness. It ennobles the Faculties of the Mind, and sancti∣fies their Use, making them, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ele∣gantly speaks, <HI>like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</HI> The Man who is of this happy Dis∣position has an infinite Advantage over those whose irreligious Sentiments, and depraved Morals, exactly, but fatally correspond: For they can never obtain the Confidence of the
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>Publick, because, having no Principle, they will of course disregard every Obligation: Whereas a religious Man meets with, and de∣serves the implicit Trust that is reposed in him; a Trust which he can never abuse who considers himself as accountable to God for all his Actions.</P>
<P>Again; He who loves his Country, will conscientiously observe the Laws which it has established. In every well regulated State equal Regard is paid to the Power of the Go∣vernor, and to the Liberties of those who are governed. It is extremely difficult to avoid particular Attachments. Men incline to a Side or Party, as Interest, or Education, or Humour happens to direct; but the true Pa∣triot forms his Judgment and determines his Actions by the golden Mean: He faithfully renders all due Respect and Service to the Ma∣jesty of Princes, but without sacrificing the Liberty of the Subject, and zealously exerts every Ability, lest Power should grow into
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>Tyranny, or Liberty degenerate into Licenti∣ousness.</P>
<P>Farther; Every one of great Abilities, who is employed in the Service of his Country will endeavour to cherish in his Mind all those Virtues which his Station is capable of exer∣cising. He who holds the Reins of Govern∣ment, a Task so arduous that few have even a Conception of it, may be cautious; but he must be void of Fear. The conscious Inte∣grity of his Heart will supply him with Steadi∣ness and Courage; and though the Weight of Power may sometimes oppress, yet will the Uprightness of his Intentions inspire him with a Resolution superior to every Difficulty. He acts with uncommon Vigor in detecting, by Vigilance, the false Friends; and opposing, by Intrepidity, the avowed Enemies of his Country. He calls forth every Virtue for the Service of his royal Master, and, what is inseparably connected with it, the general Welfare of the State. Generosity, Honour, and a Regard for the public Good are con∣spicuous
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>in him; without which the most distinguished Abilities are, to all virtuous and honourable Purposes, utterly ineffectual: And these great and necessary Virtues will be so constantly guarded and defended by him, that no bold presumptuous Vice, or little Meanness, will be able to mix with them, and by that Means, either fully or debase their Excellence. For can the Ava∣ritious, the Profligate, or the Ambitious, whose sole Aim, is to devour, to corrupt, and to enslave, be called LOVERS OF THEIR COUNTRY?</P>
<P>But we shall be fully instructed in this great and amiable Character, by summing up every Circumstance belonging to it, in the concise and expressive Terms of one who derived his Knowledge from the Fountain of Truth — LOVE THE BROTHERHOOD — FEAR GOD — HONOUR THE KING.</P>
<P>Having thus pointed out some particular In∣stances, in which that great Principle, THE LOVE
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>OF OUR COUNTRY, may be properly exerted, it will be of Use to examine into the Reasons on which the Assertion in the Text may be founded, <HI>They shall prosper that love Thee.</HI></P>
<P>The true Lover of his Country has Reason to hope for Prosperity, from the Means which he makes use of to attain Success. A good Inten∣tion, however laudable, will not be sufficient of itself to make any Design prosperous; but if the Plan be well laid, and the constituent Parts are firm and well connected, and if these Essentials are founded on the best Inten∣tion, namely, the true Interest of a Nation, we shall not only be ready to approve of, but even to answer for the Success of any Enter∣prize concerted with so much Wisdom. We of this happy Kingdom are able to produce astonishing Proofs of the great Consequence of proper Means, wisely and uprightly employed. We have seen Designs that have had for their Foundation, the Honour and Dignity of the Crown, and the Rights and Advan∣tages of the People, that have been plan∣ned
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>by the greatest Abilities, and executed with equal Talents, succeed beyond the most sanguine Expectations. But I would not pre∣sume too much on these fortunate Events, the final Issue of which it is not in the Power of human Sagacity to foresee. All that can be pronounced with Certainty is, that where Wisdom, Integrity, and Resolution are united, they are the most likely Means, as far as human Power extends, to obtain Success.</P>
<P>It is wonderful to think what a Man of this great Character can do. — He fills every Breast with his own Spirit — Men are eager to imitate his Virtues — They are ashamed not to do their Duty — They catch the noble Flame — They carry it into distant Regions — The persuasive, the animating Example excites them to sacrifice their Ease, their For∣tunes, their Health, their Lives, in Support of so wise, so just, so virtuous an Administration.</P>
<P>I can fairly appeal, not only to every Mem∣ber of this great and honourable City, which
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>is closely connected with this renowned Mori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and happy in the Connection, but to every Man, — to every disinterested Man, in the Nation, if his Heart does not glow with a Love and Admiration of these illustrious Virtues.</P>
<P>But all human Power is Weakness, all Man's Wisdom Foolishness, without the Aid and Guidance of the great Lord of the Universe: All Knowledge and Experience, all Strength and Courage, every Quality, and every Abi∣lity, is weak and vain, unless He is pleased to send his Blessing upon them.</P>
<P>It is not the Sword or the Spear, or the Mul∣titude of an Host, that can bring Success, unless <HI>the King of Kings, and Governor of all Things, whose Power no Creature is able to resist,</HI> shall save and deliver his Servants from the Hands of their Enemies. Yet must it be an unspeakable Joy, to every great and good Man, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> failing Support in the Duties of his Station, to think that God hath promised, in his holy Word, in the Book of eternal Life, to protect
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>and assist those who put their Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Con∣fidence in him, <HI>who call upon him out of a pure Heart</HI> — The <HI>Lord upholdeth the Righteous,— He shall give his Angels Charge over thee — The Salvation of the Righteous cometh of the Lord, who is also their Strength in the Day of Trouble. — Great Prosperity giveth he to his King, to his Anointed, and to his Seed for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then confirm these divine Truths; let us proclaim the great Mercy and Goodness of God, in vouchsafing such fignal Successes to his Majesty's Arms; and sending his Blessing on those Endeavours which have been used for the Chastisement of a faithless and insolent Enemy. Let us in the deepest Sense of our own Unworthiness, in a profound Veneration of God's infinite Power, and in the Voice of Praise and Thanksgiving, say, with the hea∣venly Host; <HI>Salvation, and Honour, and Power, and Glory, be unto him that sitteth on the Throne. — Great and marvellous are thy Works, O Lord God Almighty! Just and true are thy Ways, O King of Saints!"</HI></P>
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<P>It would be unnecessary to repeat all the Instances of Success with which the divine Providence hath blessed the Arms and Councels of our most gracious Sovereign: But some striking Particulars must not be omitted, tho' it is difficult to say where we shall begin to speak of the Blessings of Heaven to these King∣doms, or open the Scene of his Majesty's Glory and Happiness.</P>
<P>Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Enemies, for a while victorious; threatned utter Destruction to his Dominions, and presumptuously flattered themselves with the Certainty of Success; the God of Heaven interposed, gave a wonderful Presence of Mind to the Princely Commander, Firmness and In∣trepidity to the Soldiers, and, by a total Defeat of the Enemy, turned the King's Mourning into Victory: A Victory which will be remembered to the Honour of the <HI>British</HI> Infantry, as long as the Sun endureth; and which, considered in all its Circumstances, plainly discovered the Hand of Heaven, and proved that <HI>the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel.</HI></P>
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
<P>But the Assistance of Heaven on our Side hath not been confined to one Part of the Globe; His Majesty's Arms, under the divine Direction, have been victorious in every Quar∣ter of the World; the Triumphs on the <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Continent, obtained under the Disad∣vantages of Climate, Situation and dispropor∣tionate Numbers, are great and astonishing. Every Man beholds those Wonders with Rap∣ture and Amazement; though his Joy must feel a Check, at the Loss of that gallant Com∣mander who fell in compleating the wonderful Victory.</P>
<P>God hath been pleased also, particularly to bless his Majesty in the Friendship of his great and Royal Ally, who by his extraordinary Wisdom, Valour and Experience, by every great, and every amiable Quality, hath pur∣chased to himself a Name surpassing all the Names of Antiquity.</P>
<P>And yet our Happiness doth not even end here. We triumph on the other Element, and
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>the Seas <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear the Ensigns of our Glory. And surely it is a Circumstance never to be forgot∣ten, that the Number of the Slain in Battle, on our Part, is small and inconsiderable, when compared to the great Variety and Importance of our Conquests.</P>
<P>Let then the sacred Truth burst from our Lips, in the religious Sentiment of the royal Psalmist, <HI>The Lord of Hosts is with us; The God of Jacob is our Refuge.</HI></P>
<P>The Bounties of Heaven are unlimited — We have another Blessing which calls aloud for Acknowledgment and Gratitude.</P>
<P>We are assembled to return our unfeign∣ed Thanks to God, for most seasonably granting us at this Time, an uncommonly plentiful Harvest. <HI>The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. He turneth the Floods into a Wilderness, and drieth up the Water Springs. A fruitful Land maketh he barren, for the Wickedness of them that dwell therein. Again he maketh the Wilderness a standing Water, and
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>Water Springs of a dry Ground.</HI> — While other Nations have suffered by Scarcity, while their Land has been drenched with Blood, and their Fields have languished and mourned; God <HI>hath crowned our Year with Goodness; our Folds have been full of Sheep; our Vallies have stood so thick with Corn, that they have laughed and sung.</HI></P>
<P>This is an Aera in the Annals of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which Posterity will remember with Admiration and Reverence. They will think us an happy Generation; Surely then we ought to think ourselves so. We ought to make such a religious and moral Use of the marvellous Things which God hath done for us, as may best express our Gratitude to him, and secure his future Favour: And, in the Height of our Joy and Thanksgiving, to con∣sider that he, who hath given us such Cause to rejoice, expects that we should not suffer <HI>our Prosperity to destroy us,</HI> by being led to think <HI>our Hill so strong that it cannot be removed.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
<P>With our sincere and hearty Thanks for these wonderful and manifold Blessings, let us add our unfeigned Prayers to the Throne of Grace, and beseech Almighty God to defend and protect these Kingdoms in their Religion, Liberties, and Commerce, and to give us, in his good Time, a secure, lasting, and honourable Peace; that he would be pleased, as the most happy Means to so glorious an End, to guard and prolong the Life of our most gracious Sovereign, and to bless and preserve the Royal Family; that when the greatest and best of Kings, full of Days and Honour, shall change his temporal for an eternal Crown, We may never want a Prince, of his Illustrious House, blessed with all the Virtues of his An∣cestors, to reign over these Kingdoms, in great Dignity and Prosperity, and to govern a free, dutiful, and united People, in Righteousness, Justice and Mercy. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
