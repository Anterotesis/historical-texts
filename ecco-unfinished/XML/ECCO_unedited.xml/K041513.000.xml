Sing thou of Liberty the Works and Worth!</L>
<L>A Theme, not foreign to a Prince's Birth.</L>
<L>Then view, great Sir! (to count what Muse can cease?)</L>
<L>The Works of Freedom, Industry, and Peace!<MILESTONE N="10"/></L>
<L>To count, what Time so just! What more serene,</L>
<L>Or strong to glance 'em, than the Sylvan Scene?</L>
<L>These, when O Muse, you see, or hope to see,</L>
<L>Praise where they <HI>are,</HI> and point where they <HI>will</HI> be.</L>
<L>Unlike, where Tyranny the Rod maintains<MILESTONE N="15"/></L>
<L>O'er Turfless, Leafless, and Uncultur'd Plains;</L>
<L>Here Gardens call up Woods, and healthful Roots,</L>
<L>And, in due Season, give nectareous Fruits.</L>
<L>Along the Furrows yellow plenty shines;</L>
<L>On verdant Lawns, the Steed, or Ox, reclines;<MILESTONE N="20"/></L>
<L>Wild frisk the Flocks; which Fate has pleas'd to doom</L>
<L>Our Feast of Health, and Profits of the Loom.</L>
<L>Who digs the Mine, or Quarry, digs with Glee;</L>
<L>No Slave!—His Option, and his Gain are free.</L>
<L>Him the same Laws, the same Protection yield,<MILESTONE N="25"/></L>
<L>Who ploughs the Furrow, as who owns the Field.</L>
<L>Rough, honest, Industry, and smiling Peace,</L>
<L>Thus plant, thus build, and give the Land Encrease.</L>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<L>From peasant Hands, Imperial Works arise;</L>
<L>And <HI>British</HI> hence with <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur vies.<MILESTONE N="30"/></L>
<L>Roads, yet unknown, thro' Rocks, shall winding tend,</L>
<L>And the safe Causeway, o'er the Clays, ascend.</L>
<L>From Reservoirs, the nether Pipe here owns</L>
<L>New, ductile Streams, to visit distant Towns.</L>
<L>There vanish Fens; whence Vapours rise no more;<MILESTONE N="35"/></L>
<L>Whose aguish Influence tainted Heav'n before.</L>
<L>Where Waters deep'ning glide, and wide extend,</L>
<L>From Road to Road, the Bridge her Arch shall bend.</L>
<L>Where Ports were choak'd; where Mounds, in vain, arose;</L>
<L>There Harbours open, and there Breaches close.<MILESTONE N="40"/></L>
<L>Rivers are taught a new, commercive Flow;</L>
<L>And young Plantations, future Navies, grow:</L>
<L>(Navies, which to invasive Foes explain,</L>
<L>Heav'n throws not round us Rocks and Seas in vain.)</L>
<L>The Sail of Commerce, in each Sky, aspires;<MILESTONE N="45"/></L>
<L>And Property assures what Foil acquires.</L>
<L>See worthy Crafts, which low-born Life, divide,</L>
<L>Give Towns their Opulence, and Courts their Pride!</L>
<L>See Structures, rising from the healthy Soil,</L>
<L>For Sickness, Want, and Age, worn out with Toil!</L>

Stupendous Piles (which useful Pomp compleats)</L>
<L>Here shine Religion's, and there Learning's Seats;</L>
<L>Where moral Truth, and mystic Science, spring;</L>
<L>The Sage to tutor, and the Bard to sing;</L>
<L>Where some draw Health from Herbs, and min'ral Veins;</L>
<L>And some form Systems from etherial Plains:</L>
<L>Where some from Hist'ry, call past Times to View;</L>
<L>And others trace old Laws, and sketch out new.<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>Hence saving Rights, by Legislators plann'd;</L>
<L>And Guardian Patriots hence inspire the Land;</L>
<L>These praise the Hour when your great Sire was bor</L>
<L>And these inflame to hail your natal Morn.</L>
<L>When in familiar Scenes, you pleas'd appear,<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>The Modest and the Candid gain your Ear.</L>
<L>These, Sir, salute you from Life's middle State;</L>
<L>Rich without Gold, and without Titles great.</L>
<L>Knowledge of Books and Men exalts their Thought;</L>
<L>In Wit accomplish'd, tho' in Wiles untaught;<MILESTONE N="70"/></L>
<L>Careless of Whispers, meant to wound their Name;</L>
<L>Nor sneer'd, nor brib'd, from Virtue into Shame.</L>
<L>In Letters elegant, in Honour bright;</L>
<L>They come, they catch, and they reflect Delight.</L>

Mixing with these, a <HI>Few</HI> of <HI>Rank</HI> are found;<MILESTONE N="75"/></L>
<L>For Councils, Embassies, and Camps, renown'd.</L>
<L>Vers'd in gay Life, in honest Maxims read;</L>
<L>And ever warm of Heart; yet cool of Head.</L>
<L><HI>One,</HI> various Gallantry of Courts, relates;</L>
<L>And <HI>One</HI> the various Interests of States.<MILESTONE N="80"/></L>
<L><HI>These</HI> tell of Characters grotesque and new;</L>
<L>And <HI>Those</HI> call <HI>public spirit</HI> full in View.</L>
<L>From intermingling Veins of Humour bright,</L>
<L>Flows Knowledge, soft'ning into Ease polite.</L>
<L>Happy the Men; who such a Prince can please!<MILESTONE N="85"/></L>
<L>Happy the Prince, rever'd by Men, like these!</L>
<L>His Condescensions Dignity display;</L>
<L>Grave with the Wise, and with the Witty gay.</L>
<L>From these, the circling Glass gives Wit to shine;</L>
<L>The Bright grow brighter, and e'vn Courts refine.<MILESTONE N="90"/></L>
<L>In Scenes like these, shone the first GEORGE confest:</L>
<L>His smiling Grandeur, social Grace, express'd.</L>
<L>Look'd He on Foes? there loyal Love wou'd spring;</L>
<L>And still, when least assum'd, shone most the KING.</L>
<L>Candour is your's, and your's transparent Truth:<MILESTONE N="95"/></L>
<L>Beauty will next attract accomplish'd Youth.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
Oh!—Mark the White, Propitious Hour on Wing;</L>
<L>Which gives the Muse prophetick Strains to sing.</L>
<L>Blooming, she sees the <HI>Fair</HI> from <HI>Princes</HI> sprung;</L>
<L>Friends to <HI>pure Faith,</HI> when <HI>Faith reform'd</HI> was young!<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>
<L>A semblant <HI>Progeny,</HI> she next descries!</L>
<L>In them new Lights; to us new Joys arise:</L>
<L>But abler Bards, whom Zeal, like mine, shall fire.</L>
<L>Sublime shall sing, what humbler I admire.<MILESTONE N="104"/></L>
