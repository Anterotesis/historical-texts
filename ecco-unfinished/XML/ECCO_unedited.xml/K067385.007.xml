<P>THE King had hitherto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LVII.</NOTE> during the course of
the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1644.</NOTE> obtained many advantages over the
parliament, and had raised himself from that
low condition, into which he had at first fallen, to be
nearly upon an equal footing with his adversaries. York∣shire,
and all the northern 'counties, were subjected by
the Marquess of Newcastle; and, excepting Hull, the
parliament was master of no garrison in these quarters.
In the west, Plymouth alone, having been in vain be∣sieged
by Prince Maurice, resisted the King's authority:
And had it not been for the disappointment in the enter∣prize
of Glocester, the royal garrisons had reached,
without interruption, from one end of the kingdom to
the other; and had occupied a greater extent of ground,

<PB N="2" REF="12"/>
than those of the parliament. Many of the royalists
flattered themselves, that the same vigorous spirit, which
had elevated them to the present height of power, would
still favour their progress, and obtain them a final vic∣tory
over their antagonists: But those who judged more
soundly, observed, that, besides the accession of the
whole Scots nation to the side of the parliament; the
very principle, on which the royal successes had been
founded, was every day acquired, more and more, by
the opposite party. The King's troops, full of gentry
and nobility, had exerted a valour superior to their ene∣mies,
and had hitherto been successful in almost every
rencounter: But in proportion as the whole nation be∣came
warlike, by the continuance of civil discords, this
advantage was more equally shared, and superior num∣bers,
it was expected, must at last obtain the victory.
The King's troops also, ill paid, and destitute of every
necessary, could not possibly be retained in equal discipline
with the parliamentary forces, to whom all supplies were
furnished from unexhausted stores and treasures<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 560.</NOTE>. The
severity of manners, so much affected by these zealous
religionists, assisted their military institutions; and the
rigid inflexibility of character, by which the austere re∣formers
of church and state were distinguished, enabled
the parliamentary chiefs to restrain their soldiers within
stricter rules and more exact order. And while the
King's officers indulged themselves even in greater li∣cences,
than those to which, during times of peace, they
had been accustomed, they were apt, both to neglect
their military duty, and to set a pernicious example of
disorder, to the soldiers under their command.</P>
<P>AT the commencement of the civil wars, all English∣men,
who served abroad, were invited over, and treated
with extraordinary respect: And most of them, being
descended of good families, and by reason of their ab∣sence,
<PB N="3" REF="13"/>
unacquainted with the new principles, which de∣pressed
the dignity of the crown, had inlisted under the
royal standard. But it is observable, that though the
military profession requires great genius, and, long ex∣perience,
in the principal commanders, all its subordi∣nate
duties may be discharged by very ordinary talents,
and from superficial practice. Citizens and country-gentlemen
soon became excellent officers; and the ge∣nerals
of greatest fame and capacity happened, all of
them, to spring up on the side of the parliament. The
courtiers and great nobility in the other party, checked
the growth of any extraordinary genius among the sub∣ordinate
officers; and every man there, as in a regular
established government, was confined to the station, in
which his birth had placed him.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might make preparations, during
the winter, for the ensuing campaign, summoned to
Oxford all the members of either house, who adhered to
his interests; and endeavoured to avail himself of the name
of parliament, so passionately cherished by the English
nation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p, 559.</NOTE>. The house of peers was pretty full; and be∣sides
the nobility, employed in different parts of the
kingdom, it contained twice as many members as voted
at Westminster. The house of commons consisted of
about 140; which amounted not to above half of the
other house of commons<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 566, 574, 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO extremely light had government hitherto lain upon
the people, that the very name of <HI>excise</HI> was unknown
to them; and among the other evils arising from these
domestic wars, was the introduction of that impost into
England. The parliament at Westminster having voted
an excise on beer, wine, and other commodities; those
at Oxford imitated the example, and coferred that re∣venue
on the King. And in order to enable him the
better to recruit his army, they granted him the sum of
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
100,000 pounds, to be levied by way of loan upon the
subject. The King circulated privy seals, countersigned
by the speakers of both houses, requiring the loan of par∣ticular
sums, from such persons as lived within his quar∣ters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 590.</NOTE>.
Neither party had as yet got above the pedantry
of reproaching their antagonists with these illegal mea∣sures.</P>
<P>THE Westminster parliament passed a whimsical or∣dinance,
commanding all the inhabitants of London and
the neighbourhood, to retrench a meal a week, and to
pay the value of it for the support of the public cause<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Dugdale p. 119. Rush. vol. vi. p. 748.</NOTE>.
'Tis easily imagined, that, provided the money was paid,
they troubled themselves very little about the execution
of their ordinance.</P>
<P>SUCH was the King's situation, that, in order to re∣store
peace to the nation, he had no occasion to demand
any other terms, than to restore the laws and constitu∣tion,
to replace him in the same rights which had ever
been enjoyed by his predecessors, and to re-establish,
on its antient basis, the whole frame of government,
civil as well as ecclesiastical. And that he might facili∣tate
an end, seemingly so desirable, he offered to employ
means equally popular, an universal act or oblivion, and
a toleration or indulgence to tender consciences. No∣thing
therefore could contribute more to his interest,
than every discourse of peace, and every discussion of the
Conditions, upon which that blessing could be obtained.
And for this reason, he sollicited a treaty, on all occa∣sions,
and desired a conference and mutual examination
of pretensions, even when he entertained no hopes, that
any conclusion could possibly result from it.</P>
<P>FOR like reasons, the parliament wisely avoided, as
much as they could, all advances towards negotiation,
and were cautious not to expose too easily to censure
<PB N="5" REF="17"/>
those high terms, which their apprehensions or their am∣bition
made them previously demand of the King. Tho'
their partizans were blinded with the thickest veil of re∣ligious
prejudices, they dreaded to bring their pretensions
to the test, or lay them open before the whole nation.
In opposition to the sacred authority of the laws, to the
venerable precedents of many ages, they were ashamed
to plead nothing but fears and jealousies, which were not
avowed by the constitution, and to which, neither the
personal character of Charles, so full of virtue, nor his
condition, so deprived of all independent authority,
seemed to afford any reasonable foundation. Grievances
which had been fully redressed; powers, either legal or
illegal, which had been entirely abandoned; it seemed
unpopular, and invidious, and ungrateful, any farther
to insist on.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might abate the universal vene∣ration,
paid to the name of parliament, had issued a de∣claration,
in which he set forth all the tumults, by
which himself and his partizans in both houses, had
been driven from London; and he thence inferred, that
the assembly at Westminster was no longer a free parlia∣ment,
and, till its liberty was restored, was intitled to no
authority. As this declaration was an obstacle to all
treaty, some contrivance seemed requisite, in order to
elude it.</P>
<P>A letter was wrote to the Earl of Essex, and sub∣scribed
by the Prince, the Duke of York, and forty-three
noblemen<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 442. Rush. vol. vi. p. 566. Whitlocke, p. 77.</NOTE>. They there exhort him to be an
instrument for restoring peace, and to promote that hap∣py
end with those, by whom he was employed. Essex,
though much disgusted with the parliament, though ap∣prehensive
of the extremities to which they were driving,
though desirous of any reasonable peace; yet was still
<PB N="6" REF="18"/>
more resolute to preserve an honourable fidelity to the
trust reposed in him. He replied, that as the paper sent
him neither contained any address to the two houses of
parliament, nor any acknowledgment of their authority,
he could not communiate it to them. Like proposals
were reiterated by the King, during the ensuing campaign,
and met still with a like answer from Essex<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 444. Rush. vol. vi. p. 569, 570. Whit∣locke, p. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to make another trial for a treaty, the King,
this spring, sent another letter directed to the lords and
commons of parliament assembled at Westminster: But
as he also mentioned, in the letter, the lords and com∣mons
of parliament assembled at Oxford, and declared
that his scope and intention was to make provision that
all the members of both houses might securely meet in a
full and free convention; the parliament, clearly per∣ceiving
the conclusion which was implied, refused all
treaty upon such terms<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 449. Whitlocke, p. 79.</NOTE>. And the King, who knew
what small hopes there were of accommodation, would
not abandon the pretensions, which he had assumed, nor
acknowledge the two houses, more openly, for a free
parliament.</P>
<P>THIS winter the famous Pym died; a man as much
hated by the one party, as respected by the other. At
London, he was considered as the victim to national li∣berty,
who had abridged his life by incessant labours for
the interest of his country<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 66.</NOTE>: At Oxford, he was believed
to have been struck with an uncommon disease, and to
have been consumed with vermine; as a mark of divine
vengeance, for his multiplied crimes and treasons. He
had been so little studious of improving his private fortune
in those civil wars, of which he had been one principal
author, that the parliament thought themselves obliged,
out of gratitude, to pay the debts which he had contract∣ed<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 13th of February 1643.</NOTE>.
<PB N="7" REF="19"/>
We now return to the military operations, which,
during the winter, were carried on with vigor in several
places, notwithstanding the severity of the season.</P>
<P>THE forces, brought from Ireland, were landed at
Mostyne in North-Wales; and being put under the com∣mand
of Lord Biron, they took the castles of Hawarden,
Beeston, Action, and Deddington-house<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 299.</NOTE>. No place in Cheshire, or the neighbourhood, now adhered to the par∣liament,
except Nantwich: And to this town Biron laid
siege during the depth of winter. Sir Thomas Fairfax,
alarmed at so considerable a progress, assembled an army
of 4000 men in Yorkshire, and having joined Sir Wil∣liam
Brereton, was approaching to the camp of the
royalists. Biron and his soldiers, elated with successes
obtained in Ireland, had entertained the most profound
contempt for the parliamentary forces; a disposition,
which, if confined to the army, may be regarded as a
good presage of victory; but if it extend to the general,
is the most probable forerunner of a defeat. Fairfax sud∣denly
attacked the camp of the royalists.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of Jan.</NOTE> The swelling
of the river by a thaw divided one part of the army from
the other. That part exposed to Fairfax, being beat
from their post, retired into the church of Acton, and
were all taken prisoners: The other retreated with pre∣cipitation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 301.</NOTE>. And thus was dissipated or rendered useless
that body of forces, which had been drawn from Ireland;
and the parliamentary party revived in those north-west
counties of England.</P>
<P>THE invasion from Scotland was attended with con∣sequences
of much greater importance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion from Scot∣land.</NOTE> The Scots,
having summoned in vain the town of Newcastle, which
was fortified by the vigilance of Sir Thomas Glenham,
passed the Tyne; and faced the Marquess of Newcastle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Feb.</NOTE>
who lay at Durham with an army of 14000 men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 615.</NOTE>. Af∣ter
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
some military operations, in which that general re∣duced
the enemy to difficulties for forage and prvosions,
he received intelligence of a great disaster, which had
befallen his forces in Yorkshire. Colonel Bellasis, whom
he had left with a considerable body of troops, was to∣tally
routed at Selby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th April.</NOTE> by Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had
returned from Cheshire, with his victorious forces<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 618.</NOTE>.
Afraid of being inclosed between two armies, Newcastle
retreated; and Leven having joined Lord Fairfax, they
sat down before York, in which the army of the royalists
had shut themselves up. But as the Scots and parlia∣mentary
forces were not numerous enough to invest so
large a town, divided by a river, they contented them∣selves
to incommode it by a loose blockade; and affairs
remained, for some time, in suspense between these op∣posite
armies<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 620.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this winter and spring, other parts of the
kingdom had also been harrassed with war. Hopton,
having assembled an army of 14000 men, endeavoured
to break into Sussex, Kent, and the southern association,
which seemed well disposed to receive him. Waller fell
upon him at Cherington, and gave him a defeat<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">29th of March.</NOTE> of con∣siderable
importance. In another quarter, siege being
laid to Newark by the parliamentary forces, Prince Ru∣pert
prepared himself for relieving a town of such conse∣quence,
which alone preserved the communication open
between the King's southern and northern quarters<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 306.</NOTE>.
With a small force, but that animated by his active cou∣rage,
he broke thro' the enemy, relieved the town, and
totally dissipated that army of the parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">21st of March.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' fortune seemed to have divided her favours
between the parties, the King found himself, in the
main, a considerable loser by this winter-campaign; and
he prognosticated a still worse event from the ensuing
<PB N="9" REF="21"/>
summer. The preparations of the parliament were great,
and much exceeded the slender resources, of which he
was possessed. In the eastern association, they levied
14000 men, under the Earl of Manchester, seconded by
Cromwel<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 621.</NOTE>. An army of ten thousand men under Essex;
another of nearly the same force under Waller, were
assembled in the neighbourhood of London. The for∣mer
was destined to oppose the King: The latter was
appointed to march into the west, where Prince Maurice,
with a small army which went continually to decay, was
spending his time in vain before Lyme, an inconsiderable
town upon the sea-coast. The utmost efforts of the
King could not raise above ten thousand men at Oxford;
and on their sword chiefly, during the campaign, were
these to depend for subsistance.</P>
<P>THE Queen, terrified with the dangers, which every
way environed her, and afraid of being enclosed in Ox∣ford,
in the middle of the kingdom, fled to Exeter,
where she hoped to be delivered unmolested of the child,
of which she was now pregnant, and from whence she
had the means of an easy escape into France, if pressed by
the forces of the enemy. She knew the implacable ha∣tred,
which the parliament, on account of her religion
and her credit with the King, had all along borne her.
Last summer, the commons had sent up to the peers an
impeachment of high treason against her; because, in
his utmost distresses, she had assisted her husband with
arms and ammunition, which she had bought in Hol∣land<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 321.</NOTE>.
And had she fallen into their hands, neither her
sex, she knew, nor high station, could protect her against
insults at least, if not danger, from those haughty re∣publicans,
who so little affected to conduct themselves by
the maxims of gallantry and politeness.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning of these dissensions, the parlia∣ment,
'tis remarkable, had, in all things assumed an ex∣treme
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>
ascendant over their sovereign, and had displayed a
violence and arrogated an authority, which, on his side,
could not have been compatible, either with his temper or
his situation. While he spoke, perpetually of pardoning
all <HI>Rebels;</HI> they talked of nothing but the punihment of
<HI>Delinquents</HI> and <HI>Malignants:</HI> While he offered a tolera∣tion
and an indulgence to tender consciences; they
threatened the utter extirpation of prelacy: To his pro∣fessions
of lenity, they opposed declarations of rigor:
And the more the antient tenour of the laws inculcated
a respectful subordination to the crown, the more careful
were they, by their lofty pretensions, to cover that defect,
under which they laboured.</P>
<P>THEIR great advantages in the north seemed to second
their ambition, and finally to promise them success in
their unwarrantable enterprizes. Manchester, having
taken Lincoln, had united his army to those of Leven
and Fairfax; and York was now closely besieged by their
combined forces. That town, though vigorously de∣fended
by Newcastle, was reduced to extremity; and the
parliamentary generals, after enduring great losses and
fatigue, flattered themselves that all their labours would
at laft be crowned by that important conquest. On a
sudden, they were alarmed with the approach of Rupert.
That gallant Prince, having vigorously exerted himself
in Lancashire and Cheshire, had collected a considerable
army; and joining Sir Charles Lucas, who commanded
Newcastle's horse, hastened to the relief of York with
an army of 20,000 men. The Scots and parliamentary
generals raised the siege, and drawing up on Marston-moor,
proposed to give battle to the royalists. Prince
Rupert approached the town by another quarter, and in∣terposing
the river Ouse between him and the enemy,
safely joined his forces to those of Newcastle. The
Marquess endeavoured to persuade him, that, having so
succesfully effected his purpose, he ought to be con∣tented
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>
with the present advantage, and leave the enemy,
now much diminished by their losses, and discouraged by
their ill success, to dissolve by those mutual dissensions,
which had taken place among them<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Life of the D. of Newcastle, p. 40.</NOTE>. The Prince,
whose martial disposition was not sufficiently tempered
with prudence, nor softened by complaisance, pretend∣ing
a positive order from the King, without deigning to
consult with Newcastle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of July.</NOTE> whose great merit and services
deserved better treatment, immediately gave orders for
battle, and drew out the whole army to Marston-moor<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 506.</NOTE>.
This action was obstinately disputed between the most
numerous armies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Marston-Moor.</NOTE>
which were engaged during the whole
course of these wars; nor were the forces on each side
much different in their number. Fifty thousand British
troops were led to mutual slaughter; and the victory
seemed long undecided between them. Rupert, who
commanded the right wing of the royalists, was opposed
to Cromwel<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rush. part 3. vol. ii. p. 633.</NOTE>, who conducted the choice troops of the
parliament, enured to danger under that determined
leader, animated by zeal, and confirmed by the most ri∣gid
discipline. After a sharp combat, the cavalry of the
royalists gave way; and the infantry, who stood next
them, were likewise borne down, and put to flight.
Newcastle's regiment alone, resolute to conquer or to
perish, obstinately kept their ground, and maintained, by
their dead bodies, the same order, in which they had at
first been ranged. In the other wing Sir Thomas Fair∣fax
and Colonel Lambert, with some troops, broke thro'
the royalists; and, transported by the fury of pursuit,
soon reached their victorious friends, engaged also in
pursuit of the enemy. But after that tempest was past,

pushed them upon their own infantry, and put that whole
wing to rout. When ready to seize on their carriages
and baggage, he perceived Cromwel, who was now re∣turned
from pursuit of the other wing. Both sides were
not a little surprised to find that they must again renew
the combat for that victory, which each of them thought
they had already obtained. The front of the battle was
now exactly counterchanged, and each army occupied
the ground, which had been possessed by the enemy at
the beginning of the day. This second battle was equally
furious and desperate at the first: But after the utmost
efforts of courage by both parties, victory wholly inclined
to the side of the parliament. The Prince's train of ar∣tillery
was taken; and his whole army pushed off the
field of battle<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 632. Whitlocke, p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS event was in itself, a mighty blow to the King;
but proved much more fatal in its consequences. The
Marquess of Newcastle was intirely lost to the royal
cause. That Nobleman, the ornament of the court and
of his order, had been engaged, contrary to the natural
bent of his disposition, into these military operations,
merely by a high sense of honour and a personal regard
to his master. The dangers of war were disregarded by
his valour; but its fatigues were oppressive to his natural
indolence. Munificent and generous in his expence;
polite and elegant in his taste; courteous and humane in
his behaviour; he brought a great accession of friends
and of credit to the party, which he embraced. But
amidst all the hurry of action, his inclinations were se∣cretly
drawn to the soft arts of peace, in which he took
delight; and the charms of poetry, music, and conver∣sation
stole him often from his rougher occupations. He
chose Sir William Davenant, an ingenious poet, his
lieutenant-general: The other persons, in whom he
placed confidence, were more the instruments of his re∣fined
<PB N="13" REF="27"/>
pleasures, than qualified for the business which
they undertook: And the severity and application, re∣quisite
to the support of discipline, were qualities in which
he was entirely wanting.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 507, 508. see Warwick.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN Prince Rupert, contrary to his advice, resolved
on this battle, and issued all orders without communi∣cating
his intentions to him; he took the field, but, he
said, intirely as a volunteer; and, except by his personal
courage, which shone out with lustre, he had no share
in the action. Enraged to find, that all his successful
labours were rendered abortive by one act of fatal teme∣rity,
terrified with the prospect of renewing all his pains
and fatigue, he resolved no longer to maintain the few
resources which remained to a desperate cause, and
thought, that the same regard to honour, which had at
first called him to arms, now required him to abandon a
party, where he met with such unworthy treatment.
Next morning early, he sent word to the Prince, that
he was instantly to leave the kingdom; and without de∣lay,
he went to Scarborough, where he found a vessel,
which carried him beyond sea. During the ensuing
years, till the restoration, he lived abroad in great neces∣sity,
and saw with indifference his opulent fortune se∣questered
by those who assmed the government of Eng∣land.
He disdained, by submission or composition, to
show obeisance to their usurped authority; and the least
favourable censors of his merit allowed, that the fidelity
and services of a whole life, had sufficiently atoned for
one rash action, into which his passion had betrayed
him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 511.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE Rupert with equal precipitation drew off the
remains of his army, and retired into Lancashire. Glen∣ham,
in a few days, was obliged to surrender york;<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of July.</NOTE>
and he marched out his garrison with all the honours of

war<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 638.</NOTE>. Lord Fairfax remaining in the town, established
his government in that whole county, and sent a thou∣sand
horse into Lancashire, to join with the parliamentary
forces in that quarter, and attend the motions of Prince
Rupert: The Scots army marched northwards, in order
to join the Earl of Calender, who was advancing with
ten thousand additional forces<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 88.</NOTE>; and to reduce the town
of Newcastle, which they took by storm: The Earl of
Manchester, with Cromwel, to whom the fame of this
great victory was chiefly ascribed, and who was wounded
in the action, return'd to the eastern association, in order
to recruit his army<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 641.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE these events passed in the north, the King's
affairs in the south were conducted with more success and
more ability. Ruthven, a Scotsman, who had been
created Earl of Brentford, acted, under the King, as ge∣neral.</P>
<P>THE parliament soon compleated their two armies
commanded by Essex and Waller. The great zeal of
the city facilitated this undertaking. Many speeches
were made to the citizens, by the parliamentary leaders,
in order to excite their ardour. Hollis, in particular,
exhorted them not to spare, on this important occasion,
either their purses, their persons, or their prayers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 662.</NOTE>; and
they were sufficiently liberal, it must be confessed, in all
these contributions. The two generals had orders to
march with their combined armies towards Oxford; and,
if the King shut himself up in that city, to lay siege to
it, and by one enterprize to put a period to the war.
The King, leaving a numerous garrison in Oxford,
passed with dexterity between the two armies, which had
taken Abingdon and had enclosed him on both sides<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">3d of June.</NOTE>.
He marched towards Worcester; and Waller received
orders from Essex to follow him and watch his motions;
<PB N="15" REF="31"/>
while he himself marched into the west, in quest of Prince
Maurice. Waller had approached within two miles of
the royal camp, and was only separated from it by the
Severn, when he received intelligence, that the King
was advanced to Beudly, and directed his course towards
Shrewsbury. In order to prevent him, Waller pre∣sently dislodged, and hastened by quick marches to that
city: When the King, suddenly returning upon his own
foot-steps, reached Oxford; and having reinforced his
army from that garrison, now in his turn marched out
in quest of Waller. The two armies faced each other
at Cropredy-bridge near.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Cropredy-bridge.</NOTE> Banbury; but the Charwell
ran betwixt them. Next day, the King dislodged and
marched towards Daventry. Waller ordered a consider∣able
detachment to pass the bridge, with an intention of
falling on the rear of the royalists. He wad repulsed,
routed, and pursued with considerable loss<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 676. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 497. Sir Edward Walker, p. 31.</NOTE>. Stunned
and disheartened with this blow, his army decayed and
melted away by desertion; and the King thought he
might safely leave it, and march westward against
Essex. That general, having obliged Prince Maurice
to raise the siege of Lyme, having taken Weymouth and
Taunton, advanced still in his conquests, and met with
no equal opposition. The King followed him, and hav∣ing
re-inforced his army from all quarters, appeared in
the field with an army superior to the enemy. Essex,
retreating into Cornwall, informed the parliament of his
danger, and desired them to send an army, which might
fall on the King's rear. General Middleton received a
commission to execute that service; but came too late.
Essex's army, cooped up in a narrow corner at Lestithiel,
deprived of all forage and provisions, and seeing no pros∣pect
of succour, was reduced to the last extremity. The
King pressed them on one side; Prince Maurice on an∣other;

boat to Plymouth: Balfour with his horse passed the

of his own party.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Sept.</NOTE> The foot under Skippon were

quarters, were dismissed. By this advantage, which was
much boasted of, the King, besides the honour of the
enterprize, obtained what he stood extremely in need
of: The parliament, having preserved the men, lost
what they could easily repair<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 699, &amp;c. Whitlocke, p. 98. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 524, 524. Sir Edward Walker, p. 69, 70, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO sooner did this news reach London, than the com∣mittee
of the two kingdoms voted thanks to Essex for
his fidelity, courage, and conduct; and this method of
proceeding, no less politic than magnanimous, the par∣liament
preserved through the whole course of the war.
Equally indulgent to their friends and rigorous to their
enemies, they employed, with success, these two power∣ful
engines of reward and punishment, in confirmation
of their authority.</P>
<P>THAT the King might have less reason to exult in
the advantages, which he had obtained in the west, the
parliament opposed to him very numerous forces. Hav∣ing
armed anew Essex's subdued, but not disheartned
troops, they ordered Manchester and Cromwel to march
with their recruited forces from the eastern association;
and joining their armies to those of Waller and Middle∣ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second bat∣tle of New∣bury.</NOTE> as well as of Essex, offer battle to the King. At
Newbury, where Charles chose his post, they attacked
him with great vigour; and that town was a second
time the scene of the bloody animosities of the English.
Essex's soldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of Oct.</NOTE> exhorting one another to repair their
broken honour, and revenge the disgrace of Lestithiel,
<PB N="17" REF="35"/>
made an impetuous assault on the royalists; and having
recovered some of their cannon, lost in Cornwall, could
not forbear embracing them with tears of joy. Though
the King's troops defended themselves with great valour,
they were overpower'd by numbers; and the night came
very seasonably to their relief, and prevented a total
overthrow. Charles leaving his baggage and cannon in
Dennington-castle, near Newbury, forthwith retreated
to Wallingford, and from thence to Oxford. There
Prince Rupert and the Earl of Northampton joined him,
with considerable bodies of cavalry. Strengthened by
this re-inforcement, he ventured to advance towards the
enemy, now employed before Dennington-castle<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 721, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Essex,
detained by sickness, had not joined the army,
since his misfortune in Cornwall. Manchester who
commanded, though his forces were much superior to
those of the King, declined an engagement, and reject∣ed
Cromwel's advice, who earnestly pressed him not to
neglect so favourable an opportunity of finishing the
war. The King's army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Nov.</NOTE> by bringing off their cannon
from Dennington-castle, in the face of the enemy,
seemed sufficiently to have repaired the honour, which
they had lost at Newbury; and Charles having the satis∣faction
to excite, between Manchester and Cromwel,
equal animosities with those which formerly took place
between Essex and Waller<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. 7. p. 1.</NOTE>, distributed his army into
winter-quarters.</P>
<P>THOSE contests among the parliamentary generals,
which had disturbed their military operations, were re∣newed
in London during the winter; and each being
supported by his own faction, their mutual reproaches
and accusations agitated the whole city and parliament.
There had long prevailed, in that party, a secret distinc∣tion,
which, though the dread of the King's power had
hitherto suppressed it, yet, in proportion as the hopes of
<PB N="18" REF="36"/>
success became nearer and more immediate, began to dis∣cover
itself, with high contest and animosity. The IN∣DEPENDENTS,
who had, at first, taken shelter and con∣cealed
themselves under the wings of the PRESBYTE∣RIANS,
now evidently appeared a distinct party, and be∣trayed
very different views and pretensions. We must
here endeavour to explain the genius of this party, and
of its leaders, who henceforth occupy the scene of ac∣tion.</P>
<P>DURING those times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rise and character of the indepen∣dents.</NOTE> when the enthusiastic spirit met
with such honour and encouragement, and was the im∣mediate
means of distinction and preferment; it was im∣possible
to set bounds to these holy fervors, or confine
within any natural limits, what was directed towards an
infinite and a supernatural object. Every man, as prompt∣ed
by the warmth of his temper, excited by emulation,
or supported by his habits of hypocrisy, endeavoured to
distinguish himself beyond his fellows, and to arrive at a
higher pitch of saintship and perfection. In proportion
to its degrees of fanaticism, each sect became dangerous
and destructive, and as the independents went a note
higher than the presbyterians, they could less be re∣strained
within any bounds of temper and moderation.
From this distinction, as from a first principle, were de∣rived,
by a necessary consequence, all the other differ∣ences
of these two sects.</P>
<P>THE independents rejected all ecclesiastical establish∣ments,
and would admit of no church courts, no go∣vernment
among pastors, no interposition of the magi∣strate
in spiritual concerns, no fixed encouragement an∣nexed
to any system of doctrines or opinions. Accord∣ing
to their principles, each congregation, united volun∣tarily
and by spiritual ties, composed, within itself, a se∣parate
church, and exercised a jurisdiction, but one de∣void
of temporal sanctions, over its own pastor and its
<PB N="19" REF="37"/>
own members. The election alone of the congregation
was sufficient to bestow the sacerdotal character; and as
all essential distinction was denied between the laity and
the clergy, no ceremony, no institution, no vocation,
no imposition of hands, was supposed, as in all other
churches, to be requisite to convey a right to the holy
order. The enthusiasm of the presbyterians led them to
shake off the authority of prelates, to reject the restraint
of liturgies, to retrench ceremonies, to limit the riches
and authority of the priestly office: The fanaticism of
the independents, exalted to a higher pitch, abolished
all ecclesiastical government, disdained all creeds and
systems, rejected every ceremony, and confounded each
rank and order. The soldier, the merchant, the me∣chanic,
indulging the fervors of zeal, and guided by the
illapses of the spirit, gave himself up to an inward and
superior direction, and was consecrated, in a manner, by an
immediate intercourse and communication with Heaven.</P>
<P>THE catholics, pretending to an infallible guide, had
justified, upon that principle, their doctrine and practice
of persecution: The presbyterians, imagining that such
clear and certain tenets, as they themselves adopted,
could be rejected only from a criminal and pertinacious
obstinacy, had hitherto gratified, to the full, their bi∣gotted
zeal in a like doctrine and practice: The inde∣pendents,
from the extremity of the same zeal, were led
into the milder principles of toleration. Their mind,
set afloat in the wide sea of inspiration, could confine it∣self
within no certain limits; and the same variations,
in which an enthusiast indulged himself, he was apt, by
a natural train of thinking, to permit in others. Of all
christian sects, this was the first, which, during its pros∣perity,
as well as its adversity, always adopted the prin∣ciple
of toleration; and, 'tis remarkable, that so reason∣able
a doctrine owed its origin, not to reasoning, but to
the height of extravagance and fanaticism.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="38"/>
POPERY and prelacy alone, whose genius, they
thought, tended towards superstition, the independents
were inclined to treat with rigour. The doctrines too
of fate or destiny, they were apt to deem essential to all
religion. In these rigid opinions, the whole sectaries,
amidst all their other differences, unanimously concur∣red.</P>
<P>THE political system of the independents kept pace
with their religious. Not contented with confining, to
very narrow limits, the power of their sovereign, and
reducing the king to the rank of first magistrate; which
was the project of the presbyterians; this sect, more a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dent
in the pursuit of liberty, aspired to a total abolition
of the monarchy, and even of the aristocracy; and pro∣jected
an intire equality of rank and order, in a re∣public,
quite free and independent. In consequence of
this scheme, they were declared enemies to all proposals
for peace, except on such terms as, they knew, it was
impossible to obtain; and they adhered to that maxim,
which is, in the main, prudent and political, that who∣ever
draws the sword against his sovereign, should throw
away the scabbard. By terrifying others with the fear
of vengeance from the injured prince, they had engaged
greater numbers into the opposition against peace, and
had adopted their other principles with regard to govern∣ment
and religion. And the great success, which had
already attended the arms of the parliament, and the
greater, which was soon expected, confirmed them still
further in this obstinacy.</P>
<P>SIR Harry Vane, Oliver Cromwel, Nathaniel Fien∣nes,
and Oliver St. John, the sollicitor-general, were
regarded as the leaders of the independents. The Earl
of Essex, disgusted with a war, of which he began to
foresee the pernicious consequences, adhered to the pres∣byterians,
and promoted every reasonable plan of ac∣commodation.
<PB N="21" REF="39"/>
The Earl of Northumberland, fond of
his rank and dignity, regarded with horror a scheme,
which, if it took place, would confound himself and his
family with the lowest in the kingdom. The Earls of
Warwic, and Denbigh, Sir Philip Stapleton, Sir Wil∣liam
Waller, Hollis, Massey, Whitelocke, Mainard,
Glyn, had embraced the same sentiments. In the par∣liament,
a considerable majority, and a much greater in
the nation, were attached to the presbyterian party; and
it was only by cunning and deceit at first, and after∣wards
by violence, that the independents could entertain
any hopes of success.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Manchester, provoked at the violent
impeachment, which the King had lodged against him,
had long forwarded the war with great alacrity; but,
being a man of humanity and good principles, the view
of public calamities, and the prospect of a total subver∣sion
of government, began to moderate his ardor, and
inclined him to promote peace on any safe or honour∣able
terms. He was even suspected, in the field, not
to have pushed to the utmost against the King the ad∣vantages,
obtained by the arms of the parliament; and
Cromwel, in the public debates, revived the accusation,
that he had wilfully neglected at Dennington-castle a
favourable opportunity of finishing the war by a total
defeat of the royalists. “I showed him evidently,”
said Cromwel, “how this success might be obtained;
and only desired leave, with my own brigade of horse,
to charge the King's army in their retreat; leaving
it in the Earl's choice, if he thought proper, to re∣main
neuter with the rest of his forces: But, not∣withstanding
all my importunity, he positively and
obstinately refused his consent; and gave no other
reason but that, if we met with a defeat, there was
an end of our pretensions: We should all be rebels
<PB N="22" REF="40"/>
and traitors, and be executed and forfeited by the
law<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 561.</NOTE>?”</P>
<P>MANCHESTER, by way of recrimination, informed
the parliament, that at another time, Cromwel having
proposed some scheme, which it seemed improbable the
parliament would agree to, he insisted and said, <HI>My
Lord, if you will stick firm to honest men, you shall find
yourself at the head of an army, which will give law both to
king and parliament.</HI> “This discourse,” continued Man∣chester,
“made the greater impression on me, because
I knew the lieutenant-general to be a man of very
deep designs; and he has even ventured to tell me,
that it never would be well with England till I was
Mr. Montague, and there was ne'er a lord or peer in
the kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. v. p. 562.</NOTE>.” So full was Cromwel of these re∣publican projects, that notwithstanding his habits of
profound hypocrisy, he could not so carefully guard his
expressions, but that sometimes his favourite notions
would escape him.</P>
<P>THESE violent dissentions brought matters to extre∣mity,
and pushed the independents to the execution of
their designs. The present generals, they thought,
were more desirous of protracting than finishing the war;
and having entertained a scheme for preserving still some
ballance in the constitution, they were afraid of intirely
subduing the King, and reducing him to a condition,
where he should be intitled to ask no concessions. A
new model alone of the army would bring compleat vic∣tory
to the parliament, and free the nation from those
calamities, under which it laboured. But how to effect
this project was the difficulty. The authority, as well
as merits of Essex, was very great with the parliament.
Not only he had served them all along with the most
exact and scrupulous honour: It was, in some measure,
to be ascribed to his popularity, that they had ever been
<PB N="23" REF="41"/>
enabled to levy an army or make head against the royal
cause. Manchester, Warwic, and the other commanders
had likewise great credit with the public; nor were there
any hopes of prevailing over them, but by laying the
plan of an oblique and artificial attack, which would
conceal the real purpose of their antagonists. The Scots
and Scots commissioners, jealous of the progress of the
independents, were a new obstacle; which, without the
utmost art and subtlety, it would be difficult to sur∣mount<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 562.</NOTE>.
The methods by which this intrigue was con∣ducted,
are so singular, and mark so well the genius of
the age, that we shall give a detail of them, as they are
delivered by Lord Clarendon<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol, v. p. 565.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FAST, on the last Wednesday of every month, had
been ordered by the parliament at the beginning of these
commotions; and their preachers, on that day, kept
alive, by their vehement declamations, the popular pre∣judices
entertained against the King, against prelacy, and
against popery. The King, that he might combat the
parliament with their own weapons, appointed likewise
a monthly fast, where the people should be instructed in
the duties of loyalty and of submission to the higher
powers; and he chose the second Friday of every
month for the devotion of the royalists<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Rush. vol. vi. p. 364.</NOTE>. It was now
proposed and carried in parliament, by the independents,
that a new and more solemn fast should be voted; when
they should implore the divine assistance for extricating
them from those perplexities, in which they were at pre∣sent
involved. On that day, the preachers, after many
political prayers, took care to treat of the reigning divisions
in the parliament, and ascribed them entirely to the selfish
ends, pursued by the members. In the hands of those
members, they said, are lodged all the considerable com∣mands
of the army, all the profitable offices in the civil
<PB N="24" REF="42"/>
administration: And while the nation is falling every
day into poverty, and groans under an insupportable
load of taxes; these men multiply possessions on posses∣sions,
and will, in a little time, be masters of all the
riches in the kingdom. That such persons, who fatten
in the calamities of their country, will ever embrace any
effectual measure for bringing them to a period, or en∣suring
a final success to the war, cannot reasonably be
expected. Lingering expedients alone will be pursued:
And operations in the field concurring, in the same per∣nicious
end, with deliberations of the cabinet; civil
commotions will, for ever, be perpetuated in the nation.
After exaggerating these disorders, the ministers fell
again to their prayers; and besought the Lord that he
would take his own work into his own hand; and if the
instruments, whom he had hitherto employed, were not
worthy to bring to a conclusion so glorious a design, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would inspire others more fit, who might perfect what
was begun, and by establishing true religion, put a
speedy period to the public miseries.</P>
<P>ON the day subsequent to these devout animadversions,
when the parliament met, a new spirit appeared in the
looks of many. Sir Henry Vane told the commons,
That, if ever God appeared to them, it was in the
holy ordinances of yesterday: That, as he was credibly
informed by many, who had been auditors in different
congregations, the same lamentations and discourses,
which the godly preachers had made before them, had
been heard in other churches: That so remarkable a
concurrence could proceed only from the immediate ope∣ration
of the Holy Spirit: That he therefore besought
them, in vindication of their own honour, in confidera∣tion
of their duty to God and their country, to lay aside
all private ends, and renounce every office, attended
with profit or advantage: That the absence of so many
members, occupied in different employments, had ren∣dered
<PB N="25" REF="43"/>
the house extremely thin, and diminished the au∣thority
of their determination: And that he could not
forbear, for his own part, the accusing himself as one
who enjoyed a gainful office, that of treasurer of the
navy; and though he was possessed of it before the civil
commotions, and owed it not to the favour of the par∣liament,
yet was he ready to resign it, and to sacrifice,
to the welfare of his country, every consideration of pri∣vate
interest and advantage.</P>
<P>CROMWEL acted next his part, and commended the
preachers for having dealt with them plainly and impar∣tially,
and told them of their errors, of which they were
so unwilling to be instructed. Though they dwelt on
many things, he said, on which he had never before re∣flected;
yet, upon revolving them, he could not but
confess, that, till there was a perfect reformation in
these particulars, nothing which they undertook could
possibly prosper. The parliament, no doubt, continued
he, had done wisely in the commencement of the war,
to engage several of their members in the most dange∣gerous
parts of it; and thereby to satisfy the nation,
that they intended to share all hazards with the meanest
of the people. But affairs are now changed. During
the progress of military operations, there have arisen, in
the parliamentary armies, many excellent officers, who
are qualified for higher commands than they are now
possessed of. And though it becomes not men, engaged
in such a cause, <HI>to put trust in the arm of flesh,</HI> yet he
could assure them, that their troops contained generals,
fit to command in any enterprize in Christendom. The
army indeed, he was sorry to say, did not correspond,
by its discipline, to the merit of the officers; nor
were there any hopes, till the present vices and disor∣ders,
which prevail among the soldiers, were repressed
by a new model, that their forces would ever be at∣tended
with signal success in any undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="44"/>
IN opposition to this reasoning of the independents,
many of the presbyterians showed the inconvenience and
dangers of the projected alteration. Whitelocke, in
particular, a man of honour, who loved his country,
though, in every change of government, he always ad∣hered
to the ruling power, said, That, besides the in∣gratitude
of discarding, and that by fraud and subtilty,
so many noble persons, to whom the parliament had hi∣therto
owed its chief support; they would find it ex∣tremely
difficult to supply the place of men, now formed
by experience to command and authority: That the
rank alone, possessed by such as were members of either
house, prevented envy, retained the army in obedience,
and gave weight to military orders: That greater confi∣dence
might safely be reposed in men of family and for∣tune,
than in mere adventurers, who would be apt to
entertain separate views from those embraced by the per∣sons,
who employed them: That no maxim of policy
was more undisputed, than the necessity of preserving an
inseparable connexion between the civil and military
powers, and of retaining the latter in strict subordination
to the former: That the Greeks and Romans, the wisest
and most passionate lovers of liberty, had ever entrusted
to their senators the command of armies, and had main∣tained
an unconquerable jealousy of all mercenary forces:
And that those alone whose interest was involved in that
of the public, and who possessed a vote in the civil deli∣berations,
would sufficiently respect the authority of par∣liament,
and never could be tempted to turn the sword
against those, by whom it was committed to them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Whitlocke, p. 114, 115.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these reasonings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Self-denying ordinance.</NOTE> a committee
was chosen to frame what they called the <HI>self-denying
ordinance,</HI> by which the members of both houses were
excluded from all civil and military employments, ex∣cept
<PB N="27" REF="45"/>
a few offices which were specified. This ordinance
was the subject of great debate, and, for a long time,
rent the whole parliament and city into factions. But,
at last, by the prevalence of envy with some; with
others, of false modesty; with a great many, of the re∣publican
and independent views; it passed the house of
commons, and was sent to the upper house. The peers,
though the scheme was, in part, levelled against their
order; though all of them were, at bottom, extremely
averse to it; possessed so little authority, that they durst
not oppose the resolution of the commons; and they
thought it better policy, by an unlimited compliance, to
ward off that ruin, which they saw approaching<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Rush. vol. vii, p. 8, 15.</NOTE>. The
ordinance, therefore, having passed both houses, Essex,
Warwic, Manchester, Denbigh, Waller, Brereton, and
many others, resigned their commands, and received the
thanks of parliament for their good services. A pension
of ten thousand pounds a year was settled on Essex.</P>
<P>It was agreed to recruit the army to 22,000 men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1645.</NOTE> and
Sir Thomas Fairfax was appointed general<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Whitlocke, p. 118. Rush. vol. vii. p. 7.</NOTE>. 'Tis re∣markable,
that his commission did not run, like that of
Essex, in the name of the king and parliament, but in
that of the parliament alone: And the article of the safe∣ty
of the king's person was omitted. So much had the
animosities increased between the parties<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Whitlocke, p. 133.</NOTE>. Cromwel,
being a member of the lower house, should have been
discarded with the others; but this impartiality would
have disappointed all the views of those, who had intro∣duced
the self-denying ordinance. He was saved by a
subtilty, and by that political craft, in which he was so
eminent. At the time, when the other officers resigned
their commissions, care was taken, that he should be sent
with a body of horse, in order to relieve Taunton, be∣sieged

by the royalists. His absence being remarked, or∣ders
were dispatched for his immediate attendance in par∣liament;
and the new general was directed to employ
some other officer in that service. A ready compliance
was feigned; and the very day was named, on which, it
was averred, he would take his place in the house. But
Fairfax having appointed a rendezvous of the army,
wrote to the parliament, and desired leave to retain, for
some days, Lieutenant-general Cromwel, whose advice
he said, would be useful, in supplying the place of those
officers, who had resigned. Shortly after, he begged,
with much earnestness, that they would allow Cromwel
to serve that campaign<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 629, 630. Whitlocke, p. 141.</NOTE>. And thus the independents,
tho' the minority, prevailed by art and cunning over the
presbyterians, and bestowed the who lemilitary authority,
in appearance, upon Fairfax; in reality, upon Cromwel.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX was a person equally eminent for courage
and for humanity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax.</NOTE> and tho' strongly infected with the
prejudices or principles, derived from religious and party-zeal,
he seems never, in the course of his public con∣duct,
to have been seduced, by private interest or ambi∣tion,
from adhering strictly to these principles. Sincere
in his professions; disinterested in his views; open in his
conduct; he had formed one of the most shining cha∣racters
of that age; had not the extreme narrowness of
his genius, in every thing but in war, and his embarrassed
and confused elocution, on every occasion but when he
gave orders, diminished the lustre of his merit, and ren∣dered
the part, which he acted, even when invested with
the supreme command, but secondary and subordinate.</P>
<P>CROMWEL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel.</NOTE> by whose sagacity and insinuation Fairfax
was entirely governed, is one of the most eminent and
most singular personages, which occurs in history: The
strokes of his character are as open and strongly marked,
<PB N="29" REF="49"/>
as the schemes of his conduct were, during the time, dark
and impenetrable. His extensive capacity enabled him
to form the most enlarged projects: His enterprizing ge∣nius
was not dismayed with the boldest and most danger∣ous.
Carried, by his natural temper, to magnanimity,
to grandeur, and to an imperious and domineering poli∣cy;
he yet knew, when necessary, to employ the most
profound dissimulation, the most oblique and refined ar∣tifice,
the semblance of the greatest moderation and sim∣plicity.
A friend to justice, tho' his public conduct was
one continued violation of it; devoted to religion, tho'
he perpetually employed it as the instrument of his am∣bition;
he was engaged in crimes from the prospect of
sovereign power, a temptation which is, in general, irre∣ssitible
to human nature. And by using well that au∣thority,
which he attained by fraud and violence, he has
lessened, if not overpowered, our detestation of his enor∣mities,
by our admiration of his success and of his ge∣nius.</P>
<P>DURING this important transaction of the self-deny∣ing
ordinance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of Uxbridge.</NOTE> the negotiations for peace were likewise
carried on, tho' with small hopes of success. The King
having sent two messages, one from Evesham<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">4th of July, 1644.</NOTE>, another
from Tavistocke<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">8th of Sept. 1644.</NOTE>, desiring a treaty, the parliament dis∣patched
commissioners to Oxford, with proposals, as high
as if they had obtained a compleat victory<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 737. Rush. vol. vi. p. 850.</NOTE>. The ad∣vantages
gained during the campaign, and the great
distresses of the royalists, had much elevated their hopes;
and they were resolved to repose no trust in men, en∣flamed
with the highest animosity against them, and who,
were they possessed of power, were fully authorized by
law to punish all their opponents as rebels and as
traitors.</P>

THE King, when he considered the proposals and the
disposition of the parliament, could not expect any ac∣commodation,
and had no prospect but of war, or of
total submission and subjection: Yet, in order to satisfy
his own party, who were extremely impatient for peace,
he agreed to send the Duke of Richmond and Earl of
Southampton, with an answer to the parliament's propo∣sals,
and at the same time to desire a treaty upon their
mutual demands and pretensions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 110.</NOTE>. It now became ne∣cessary
for him to retract his former declaration, that the
two houses at Westminster were not a free parliament;
and accordingly, he was induced, though with great re∣luctance,
to give them, in his answer, the appellation of
the parliament of England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 111. Dugdale, p. 748.</NOTE>. But it appeared after∣wards,
by a letter, which he wrote to the Queen, and
of which a copy was taken at the battle of Naseby, that
he secretly entered an explanatory protestation in his
council-book; and he pretended, tho' he had <HI>called</HI> them
the parliament, that he had not thereby <HI>acknowledged</HI>
them for such<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">His words are, “As for my calling those at London a parliament, I
shall refer thee to Digby for particular satisfaction; this in general: If there
had been but two besides myself, of my opinion, I had not done it; and
the argument, that prevailed with me was, that the calling did no ways
acknowledge them to be a parliament; upon which condition and con∣struction
I did it, and no otherwise; art accordingly it is register'd in the
council books, with the council's unanimous approbation.” <HI>The King's
Cabinet opened. Rush.</HI> vol. vi. p. 943.</NOTE>. This subtlety, which has been fre∣quently
objected to Charles, is the most noted of those
very few instances, from which the enemies of this Prince
have endeavoured to load him with the imputation of in∣sincerity;
and have inferred that the parliament could
repose no confidence in his professions and declarations,
not even in his laws and statutes. There is, however,
it must be confessed, a difference universally avowed be∣tween
simply giving to men the appellation, which they
<PB N="31" REF="53"/>
assume, and the solemn acknowledgment of their title to
it; tho' it had perhaps been better, had the King, in
such delicate transactions between him and his people,
kept at the widest distance from such suspicious dis∣tinctions.</P>
<P>THE time and place of treaty were agreed on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of Jan.</NOTE> and
accordingly sixteen commissioners from the King met at
Uxbridge with twelve authorized by the parliament, at∣tended
with the Scots commissioners. It was agreed that
the Scots and parliamentary commissioners should give in
their demands with regard to three important articles,
<HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Militia,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that these should
be successively examined and discussed in conferences with
the King's commissioners<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 121. Dugdale, p. 758.</NOTE>. It was soon found totally
impracticable to come to any agreement with regard to
any of these articles.</P>
<P>IN the summer 1643, while the negotiations were car∣ried
on with Scotland, the parliament had summoned an
assembly at Westminster, composed of 121 divines and
30 laymen, celebrated in their party for piety and learn∣ing.
By their advice, alterations were made in the
thirty-nine articles, or in the metaphysical doctrines of
the church; and, what was of greater importance, the
liturgy was entirely abolished, and, in its place, a new
directory for worship was established; by which, suitable
to the spirit of the puritans, the utmost liberty, both in
praying and preaching, was indulged to the public
teachers. By the solemn league and covenant, episco∣pacy
was abjured, as destructive of all true piety; and
a national engagement, attended with every circumstance,
which could render a promis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sacred and obligatory, was
entered into with the Scots, never to suffer its re-admis∣sion.
All these measures showed little spirit of accom∣modation in the parliament; and the King's commis∣sioners
were not surprized to find the establishment of
<PB N="32" REF="54"/>
presbytery and the directory positively demanded, toge∣ther
with the subscription to the covenant, both by the
King and kingdom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Such love of contradiction prevailed in the parliament, that they had con∣verted Christmas, which, with the churchmen, was a great festival, into a solemn fast and humiliation; “In order,” as they said, “that it might call to remembrance our sins and the sins of our forefathers, who, pretending to celebrate the memory of Christ, have turned this feast into an extreme forgetfulness of him, by giving liberty to carnal and sensual delights.” <HI>Rush.</HI> vol. vi. p. 817. 'Tis remarkable, that, as the parliament abolished all holy days, and severely prohibited all amusement on the Sabbath; and even burned, by the hands of the hangman, the King's book of sports; the na∣tion found, that there was no time left for relaxation or diversion. Upon ap∣plication, therefore, of the servants and apprentices, the parliament appointed the second Tuesday of every month for play and recreation. <HI>Rush.</HI> vol. vii. p. 460. <HI>Whitelocke,</HI> p. 247. But these institutions, they found great difficulty to execute; and the people were resolved to be merry when they pleased, not when the parliament should prescribe to them. The keeping of Christmas holy-days was long a great mark of malignancy, and very severely censured by the commons. <HI>Whitelocke,</HI> p. 286. Even minced pyes, which custom had made a Christmas dish among the churchmen, was regarded, during that season as a profane and superstitious viand by the sectaries; tho' at other times it agreed very well with their stomachs. In the parliamentary ordi∣nance too, for the observance of the Sabbath, they inserted a clause for the taking down of May-poles, which they called a heathenish vanity. Since we are upon this subject, it may not be amiss to mention, that, beside setting apart Sunday for the ordinances, as they called them, the godly had regular meetings on the Thursdays for resolving cases of conscience, and conferring about their progress in grace. What they were chiefly anxious about, was the fixing the precise moment of their conversion or new birth; and whoever could not ascertain so difficult a point of calculation, could not pretend any title to saintship. The profane scholars at Oxford, after the parliament be∣came masters of that town, gave to the house, in which the zealots assembled the denomination of <HI>Scruple-Shop:</HI> The zealots, in their turn, insulted the scholars and professors; and, intruding into the place of lectures, declaime<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against human learning, and challenged the most knowing of them to prov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that their calling was from Christ. See Wood's Fasti Oxoniensis, p. 740.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD Charles been of a disposition to neglect all theo∣logical
controversy; he yet had been obliged, in good
policy, to adhere to episcopal jurisdiction, not only be∣cause
it was favourable to monarchy, but because all his
<PB N="33" REF="55"/>
adherents were passionately devoted to it; and to abandon
them, in what they regarded as so important an article,
was for ever to relinquish their friendship and assistance.
But Charles had never attained such enlarged principles.
He esteemed bishops essential to the very being of a
christian church; and he thought himself bound, by
more sacred ties, than those of policy, or even of ho∣nour,
to the support of that order. His concessions
therefore, on this head, he judged suffcient, when he
agreed, that an indulgence should be given to tender
consciences with regard to ceremonies; that the bishops
should exercise no act of jurisdiction or ordination, with∣out
the consent and council of such presbyters as should
be chosen by the clergy of each diocese; that they should
reside constantly in their diocese, and be bound to preach
every Sunday; that pluralities be abolished; that abuses
in ecclesiastical courts be redressed; and that a hundred
thousand pounds be levied from the bishop's estates and
the chapter lands, for payment of debts contracted by the
parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 779, 780.</NOTE>. These concessions, tho' considerable, gave
no satisfaction to the parliamentary commissioners; and,
without abating any thing of their rigor on this head,
they proceeded to their demands with regard to the mi∣litia.</P>
<P>THE king's partizans had all along maintained, that
the fears and jealousies of the parliament, after the secu∣rities
so early and easily given to public liberty, were
either feigned or groundless; and that no human institu∣tion
could be better poized and adjusted, than was now
the government of England. By the abolition of the
star-chamber and court of high commission, the prero∣gative,
they said, has lost all that coercive power, by
which it had formerly suppressed or endangered liberty:
By the establishment of triennial parliaments, it can have
<PB N="34" REF="56"/>
no leisure to acquire new powers, or guard itself, during
any time, from the inspection of that vigilant assembly:
By the slender revenue of the crown, no king can ever
attain such influence as to procure a repeal of these salu∣tary
statutes: and while the prince commands no mer∣cenary
forces, he will in vain, by violence, attempt an
infringement of laws, so clearly defined by means of
late disputes, and so passionately cherished by all his sub∣jects.
In this situation surely, the nation, governed by
so virtuous a monarch, may, for the present, remain in
tranquility, and try, whether it be not possible, by peace∣ful
arts, to elude that danger, with which, it is pretend∣ed,
its liberties are still threatened.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the royalists insisted on these plausible topics,
before the commencement of the war, they were obliged
to own, that the progress of civil commotions had some∣what
abated the force and evidence of this reasoning.
If the power of the militia, said the opposite party, be
entrusted to the King, it were not now difficult for him to
abuse that authority. By the rage of intestine discord, his
partizans are enflamed into an extreme hatred against
their antagonists; and have contracted, no doubt, some
prejudices against popular privileges, which, in their ap∣prehension,
have been the source of so much mischief.
Were the arms of the state, therefore, put entirely into
such hands; what public security, it may be demanded,
can be given to liberty, or what private security to those,
who, in opposition to the letter of the law, have so ge∣nerously
ventured their lives in its defence? In compli∣ance
with this apprehension, Charles offered, that the
arms of the state should be entrusted, during three years,
to twenty commissioners, who should be named, either
by common agreement between him and the parliament,
or the one half by him, the other by the parliament.
And, after the expiration of that term, he insisted, that
<PB N="35" REF="57"/>
his constitutional authority over the militia should again
return to him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 798.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE parliamentary commissioners at first demanded,
that the power of the sword should for ever be entrusted
to such persons, as the parliament alone should ap∣point<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 791.</NOTE>:
But afterwards, they relaxed so far, as to re∣quire
that authority only for seven years; after which,
it was not to return to the king, but to be settled by
bill, or by common agreement between him and his par∣liament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 820</NOTE>.
The King's commissioners asked, Whether
jealousies and fears were all on one side, and whether the
prince, from such violent attempts and pretensions as he
had experienced, had not, at least, equal reason to ap∣prehend
for his authority, as they for their liberty?
Whether there was any equity, in securing only one
party, and leaving the other, during the course of seven
years, entirely at the mercy of their enemies? Whether,
if unlimited power was entrusted to the parliament during
so long a period, it would not be easy for them to frame
the subsequent bill in the manner most agreeable to them∣selves,
and keep for ever possession of the sword, as well
as of every article of civil power and jurisdiction<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 877.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>THE truth is, after the commencement of the war, it
was very difficult, if not impossible, to find security for
both parties, especially for that of the parliament. Amidst
such violent animosities, power alone could ensure safe∣ty;
and the power of one side was necessarily attended
with the danger of the other. Few or no instances occur
in history of an equal, peaceful, and durable accommo∣dation,
that has been concluded between two factions,
which have been inflamed into civil war.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Ireland, there were no greater hopes
of agreement between the parties. The Parliament de∣manded,
<PB N="36" REF="58"/>
That the cessation with the rebels should be
declared null; that the management of the war should
be given over entirely to the parliament; and that after
the conquest of Ireland, the nomination of the Lord
lieutenant and of the judges, or in other words, the so∣vereignty
of that kingdom, should likewise remain in
their hands<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 826, 827.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered a peaceful accommodation still more
desperate: The demands on these three heads, however
exorbitant, were acknowledged, by the parliamentary
commissioners, to be nothing but preliminaries. Were
all these granted, they still reserved the power of reviving
those other demands, still more exorbitant, which, a
little before, had been transmitted to the King at Ox∣ford.
Such ignominious terms were there insisted on,
as worse could scarcely be demanded, were Charles to∣tally
vanquished, a prisoner, and in chains. The King
was required to attaint and exempt from a general par∣don,
forty of the most considerable of his English sub∣jects,
and nineteen of his Scots, together with all popish
recusants in both kingdoms, who had borne arms for
him. It was insisted, that forty-eight more, with all
members who had sat in either house at Oxford, all
lawyers and divines who had embraced the King's party,
should be rendered incapable of any office, be forbid
the exercise of their profession, be prohibited from
coming within the verge of the court, and forfeit the
third of their estates to the parliament. It was re∣quired,
that whoever had borne arms for the King, should
forfeit the tenth part of their estates, or if that did not
suffice, the sixth, for the payment of public debts. As
if the royal authority were not sufficiently annihilated by
such terms, it was demanded, that the court of wards
should be abolised; that all the considerable officers of
the crown, and all the judges, should be appointed by
<PB N="37" REF="59"/>
parliament; and that the right of peace and war should
not be exercised without the consent of that assembly<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 850. Dugdale, p. 737.</NOTE>.
The presbyterians, it must be confessed, after insisting
on such conditions, differed only in words, from the in∣dependents,
who required the establishment of a pure re∣public.
When the debates had been carried on to no
purpose, during twenty days, among the commissioners,
they separated, and returned; those of the King, to
Oxford, those of the parliament, to London.</P>
<P>A little before the commencement of this fruitless
treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Laud.</NOTE> a deed was executed by the parliament, which
proved their determined resolution to yield nothing, but
to proceed in the same violent and imperious manner,
with which they had, at first, entered on these danger∣ous
enterprizes. Archbishop Laud, the most favoured
minister of the king, was brought to the scaffold; and
in this instance, the public might see, that popular as∣semblies,
as, by their very number, they are, in a great
measure, exempt from the restraint of shame, so, when
they also overleap the bounds of law, naturally break
out into acts of the greatest tyranny and injustice.</P>
<P>FROM the time, that Laud had been committed, the
house of commons, engaged in enterprizes of greater
moment, had found no leisure to finish his impeach∣ment;
and he had patiently endured so long an imprison∣ment
without being brought to any trial. After the
union with Scotland, the bigotted prejudices of that na∣tion
revived the like spirit in England; and the sectaries
resolved to gratify their vengeance in the punishment of
this prelate, who had so long, by his authority, and by
the execution of penal laws, kept their zealous spirit
under confinement. He was accused of high treason, in
endeavouring to subvert the fundamental laws, and of
other high crimes and misdemeanors. The same illega∣lity
of an accumulative crime and a constructive evi∣dence,
<PB N="38" REF="60"/>
which appeared in the case of Strafford; the
same violence and iniquity in conducting the trial, are
conspicuous through the whole course of this prosecu∣tion.
The groundless charge of popery, which was be∣lied
by his whole life and conduct, was continually urged
against the prisoner; and every error rendered unpardon∣able
by this imputation, which was supposed to imply
the height of all enormities. “This man, my lords,”
said serjeant Wilde, concluding his long speech against
him, “is like Naaman the Syrian; a great man, but a
leper<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rush vol. vi. p. 830.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WE shall not enter into a detail of this matter, which,
at present, seems to admit of so little controversy. It
suffices to say, that after a long trial, and the examina∣tion
of above a hundred and fifty witnesses, the commons
found so little likelihood of obtaining a judicial sentence
against Laud, that they were obliged to have recourse to
their legislative authority, and to pass an ordinance for
taking away the life of this aged prelate. Notwithstand∣ing
the low condition, into which the house of peers
were fallen, there appeared some intention of rejecting
this ordinance; and the popular leaders were again ob∣liged
to apply to the multitude, and to extinguish, by
threats of new tumults, the small remains of liberty,
possessed by the upper house. Seven peers alone voted
in this important question. The rest, either from shame
or fear, took care to absent themselves<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAUD, who had behaved during his trial with great
spirit and vigor of genius, sunk not under the horrors of
his execution; but tho' he usually professed himself ap∣prehensive
of a violent death, he found all his fears to dis∣sipate
before that superior courage, by which he was
animated. “No one,” said he, “can be more willing
to send me out of life, than I am desirous to go.”
<PB N="39" REF="61"/>
Even upon the scaffold, and during the intervals of his
prayers, he was harrassed and molested by Sir John Clot∣worthy,
a zealot of the reigning sect, and a great leader
in the lower house: This was the time he chose for ex∣amining
the principles of the dying primate, and tra∣paning
him into a confession, that he trusted, for his sal∣vation,
to the merits of good works, not to the death
of the Redeemer<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 838, 839.</NOTE>. Having extricated himself from
these theological toils, the Archbishop laid his head on
the block; and it was severed from the body by one
blow<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">12th of July.</NOTE>. Those theological opinions, for which he suf∣fered,
contributed, no doubt, to the courage and con∣stancy
of his end. Sincere, he undoubtedly was, and,
however misguided, actuated by religious motives in all
his pursuits; and it is to be regretted that a man of such
spirit, who conducted his enterprizes with so much
warmth and industry, had not entertained more enlarged
views, and embraced principles more favourable to the
general happiness of society.</P>
<P>THE great and important advantage, which the party
gained by Strafford's death, may in some degree, pal∣liate
the iniquity of the sentence pronounced against
him: But the execution of this old infirm prelate, who
had so long remained an inoffensive prisoner, can be as∣cribed
to nothing but vengeance and bigotry in those se∣vere
religionists, by whom the parliament was intirely go∣verned.
That he deserved a better fate was not ques∣tioned
by any reasonable man: The degree of his merit
was, in other respects, much disputed. Some accused
him of recommending slavish doctrines, of promoting
persecution, and of encouraging superstition; while
others thought, that his conduct, in these three particu∣lars, would admit of apology and extenuation.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>letter</HI> of the law, as much as the most
flaming court-sermon, inculcates passive obedience, is
<PB N="40" REF="62"/>
very apparent: And tho' the <HI>spirit</HI> of a limited govern∣ment
seems to require, in extraordinary cases, some mi∣tigation
of so rigorous a doctrine; it must be confessed,
that the preceding genius of the English constitution
had rendered a mistake in this particular very natural and

from the exact line of truth in these nice questions;
so far from being favourable to national liberty; savours
strongly of the spirit of tyranny and proscription.</P>
<P>TOLERATION had hitherto been so little the principle
of any christian sect, that even the catholics, the rem∣nant
of the religion professed by their ancestors, could
not obtain from the English the least indulgence. This
very house of commons, in their famous remonstrance,
took care to justify themselves, as from the highest im∣putation,
of any intention to relax the golden reins of
discipline, as they called them, or grant any toleration<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 705.</NOTE>,
And the enemies of the church were so fair from the
beginning, as not to lay claim to liberty of conscience,
which they called a toleration for soul murder. They
openly challenged the superiority, and even menaced the
established church with that persecution, which they af∣terwards
exercised against it with such severity. And if
the question be considered in the view of policy; tho' a
sect, already formed and advanced, may, with good rea∣son,
demand a toleration; what title had the puritans to
this indulgence, who were just on the point of separa∣tion
from the church, and whom, it might be hoped,
some wholsome and legal severities would still retain in
their obedience to it<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">That Laud's severity was not extreme, appears from this fact, that he caused the acts or records of the high commission-court to be searched, and found that there had been fewer suspensions, deprivations, and other punish∣ments, by three, during the seven years of his time, than in any seven years of his predecessor Abbot; who was notwithstanding in great esteem with the house of commons. <HI>Troubles and trials of Laud,</HI> p. 164. But Abbot was little attached to the court, and was also a puritan in doctrine, and bore a mortal hatred to the papists. Not to mention, that the mutinous spirit was rising higher in the time of Laud, and would less bear controul. The maxims, however, of his administration were the same which had ever prevailed in England, and which had place in every other European nation, except Hol∣land, which studied chiefly the interests of commerce, and France, which was fetter'd by edicts and treaties. To have changed them for the modern maxims of toleration, however reasonable, would have been deemed a very bold and dangerous enterprize. It is a principle, advanced by president Mon∣tesquieu, that, where the magistrate is satisfy'd with the establish'd Religion, he ought to repress the first attempts towards innovation, and only grant a toleration to sects that are diffus'd and establish'd. See l'Esprit des Loix, Liv. 25. chap. 10. According to this principle, Laud's indulgence to the Ca∣tholics, and severity to the puritans, would admit of apology. I own, how∣ever, that it is very questionable, whether persecution can in any case be justify'd.</NOTE>?</P>

WHATEVER ridicule, to a philosophical mind, may
be thrown on pious ceremonies, it must be confess'd,
that, during a very religious age, no institution can be
more advantageous to the rude multitude, and tend more
to mollify that fierce and gloomy spirit of devotion, to
which they are subject. Even the English church, tho'
it had retained a share of popish ceremonies, may justly
be thought too naked and unadorned, and still to approach
too near the abstract and spiritual religion of the puritans.
Laud and his associates, by reviving a few primitive in∣stitutions
of this nature, corrected the error of the first
reformers, and presented, to the affrightened and astonish∣ed
mind, some sensible, exterior observances, which
might occupy it during its religious exercises, and abate
the violence of its disappointed efforts. The thought,
no longer bent on that divine and mysterious Essence, so
superior to the narrow capacities of mankind, was able,
by means of the new model of devotion, to relax itself in
the contemplation of pictures, postures, vestments, build∣ings;
and all the fine arts, which ministred to religion,
thereby received additional encouragement. The primate,
<PB N="42" REF="64"/>
'tis true, conducted this scheme, not with the enlarged
sentiments and cool disposition of a legislator, but with
the intemperate zeal of a sectary; and by over-looking
the circumstances of the times, served rather to inflame
that religious fury, which he meant to repress. But this
blemish is more to be regarded as a general imputation
on the whole age, than any particular failing of Laud;
and 'tis sufficient for his vindication to observe, that his
errors were the most excusable of all those which pre∣vailed
during that zealous period.</P>

<P>WHILE the King's affairs declined in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LVIII.</NOTE>
some events happened in Scotland, which seem∣ed
to promise him a more prosperous issue of the quarrel.</P>
<P>BEFORE the commencement of these civil disorders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montrose's victories.</NOTE>
the Earl of Montrose, a young nobleman of a distin∣guished
family, returning from his travels, had been in∣troduced
to the King, and had made an offer of his ser∣vices;
but by the insinuations of the Marquess, after∣wards
Duke of Hamilton, who possessed much of
Charles's confidence, he had not been received with that
distinction, to which he thought himself justly intitled<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Nalson, Intr. p. 63.</NOTE>.
Disgusted with this treatment, he had forwarded all
the violence of the covenanters; and agreeable to the
natural ardour of his genius, he had employed himself,
during the first insurrection, with great zeal as well as
success, in levying and conducting their armies. Being
commissioned by the <HI>Tables</HI> to wait upon the King, while
the royal army lay at Berwic, he was so won upon by
the civilities and caresses of that monarch, that he thence∣forth
devoted himself intirely, though secretly, to his
service, and entred into a close correspondence with him.
In the second Scottish insurrection, a great military
command was entrusted to him by the covenanters; and
he was the first who passed the Tweed, at the head of

their troops, in the invasion of England. He found
means, however, soon after to convey a letter to the
King: And by the infidelity of some about that Prince;
Hamilton, as was by some suspected; a copy of this let∣ter
was sent to Leven the Scots general. Being ac∣cused
of treachery, and a correspondence with the ene∣my,
Montrose openly avowed the letter; and asked the
generals, if they dared to call their sovereign an enemy:
And by this bold and magnanimous behaviour, he
escaped the danger of an immediate prosecution. As he
was now fully known to be of the royal party, he no
longer concealed his principles; and he endeavoured to
draw those, who had entertained like sentiments, into a
bond of association for his master's service. Though
thrown into prison for this enterprize<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">It is not improper to take notice of a mistake committed by Clarendon, much to the disadvantage of this gallant Nobleman; that he offered the King, when his Majesty was in Scotland, to assassinate Argyle. All the time the King was in Scotland, Montrose was confined to prison. Rush. vol. vi. p. 980.</NOTE>, and detained
some time, he was not discouraged; but still continued, by his countenance and protection, to infuse spirit into
the distressed royalists. Among other persons of distinc∣tion,
who united themselves to him, was the Lord Na∣pier
of Merchiston, son to the famous inventor of the
logarithms, the person to whom the title of a GREAT
MAN is more justly due, than to any other, whom his
country ever produced.</P>
<P>THERE was in Scotland another party, who, profes∣sing
equal attachment to the King's service, pretended
only to differ with Montrose about the means of attain∣ing
the same end; and of this party, Duke Hamilton
was the leader. That Nobleman had cause to be ex∣tremely
devoted to the King, not only by reason of the
connexion of blood, which united him to the royal fa∣mily;
but on account of the great confidence and fa∣vour
with which he had ever been honoured by his
master. Being accused by Lord Rae, not without some
<PB N="45" REF="69"/>
appearance or probability, of a conspiracy against the
King; Charles was so far from harbouring suspicion
against him, that, the very first time Hamilton came to
court, he received him into his bed-chamber, and passed
alone the night with him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 683.</NOTE>. But such was the Duke's
unhappy fate or conduct, that he escaped not the impu∣tation
of treachery to his friend and sovereign; and
though he at last sacrificed his life in the King's service,
his integrity and sincerity have not been thought by his∣torians
intirely free from blemish. Perhaps, (and this
is the most probable opinion) the subtilties and refine∣ments
of his conduct and his temporizing maxims, tho'
accompanied with good intentions, have been the chief
cause of a suspicion, which has never yet been either
fully proved or refuted. As much as the bold and vivid
spirit of Montrose prompted him to enterprizing mea∣sures,
as much was the cautious temper of Hamilton in∣clined
to such as were moderate and dilatory. While
the former foretold, that the Scots covenanters were se∣cretly
forming an union with the English parliament,
and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some
vigorous undertaking; the latter still insisted, that every
such attempt would precipitate them into measures, to
which, otherwise, they were not, perhaps, inclined.
After the Scots parliament was summoned without the
King's authority, the former exclaimed, that their in∣tentions
were now visible, and that if some unexpected
blow was not struck, to dissipate them, they would arm
the whole nation against the King; the latter maintained
the possibility of outvoting the disaffected party, and se∣curing,
by peaceful means, the allegiance of the Scots
nation<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 380, 381. Rush. vol. vi. p. 980. Wishart, cap. 2.</NOTE>. Unhappily for the royal cause, Hamilton's
representations met with more credit from the King and
Queen, than those of Montrose; and the covenanters
<PB N="46" REF="70"/>
were allowed, without interruption, to proceed in all
their hostile measures. Montrose then hastened to Ox∣ford;
where his invectives against Hamilton's treachery,
concurring with the general prepossession, and supported
by the unfortunate event of his councils, were entertain∣ed
with universal approbation. Influenced by the clam∣our
of his party, more than his own suspicions, Charles,
so soon as Hamilton appeared, sent him prisoner to Pen∣dennis
castle in Cornwall. His brother, Laneric, who
was also put under confinement, found means to make
his escape, and fly into Scotland.</P>
<P>THE King's ears were now open to Montrose's coun∣cils,
who proposed none but the boldest and most daring,
agreeable to the desperate state of the royal cause in
Scotland. Though the whole nation was occupied by
the covenanters, though great armies were kept on foot
by them, and every place guarded by a vigilant admini∣stration;
he undertook, by his own credit, and that of
the few friends, who remained to the King, to raise such
commotions, as would soon oblige the male-contents to
recal those forces, which had so sensibly thrown the ba∣lance
in favour of the parliament<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wishart, cap. 3.</NOTE>. Not discouraged
with the defeat at Marston moor, which rendered it im∣possible
for him to draw any succour from England; he
was contented to stipulate with the Earl of Antrim, a
Nobleman of Ireland, for some supply of men from that
country. And he himself, changing his disguises and
passing through many dangers, arrived in Scotland;
where he lay concealed in the borders of the Highlands,
and secretly prepared the minds of his partizans for the
attempting some great enterprize<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 618. Rush. vol. vi. p. 982. Wishart, cap. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO sooner were the Irish landed, though not exceed∣ing
eleven hundred foot, very ill armed, than Montrose
declared himself, and entered upon that scene of action,
<PB N="47" REF="71"/>
which has rendered his name so celebrated. About eight
hundred of the men of Athole flocked to his standard.
Five hundred men more, who had been levied by the
covenanters, were persuaded to embrace the royal cause:
And with this combined force, he hastened to attack
Lord Elcho, who lay at Perth with an army of 6000
men, assembled upon the first news of the Irish invasion.
Montrose, inferior in number, totally unprovided of
horse, ill supplied with arms and ammunition, had no∣thing
to depend on, but the courage, which he himself,
by his own example, and the rapidity of his enterprizes,
should inspire into his raw soldiers. Having received the
fire of the enemy, which was answered chiefly with a
volley of stones, he rushed amidst them with his sword
drawn, threw them into confusion, pushed his advantage,
and obtained a complete victory, with the slaughter of
two thousand of the covenanters<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1st of September 1644. Rush. vol. vi. p. 983. Wishart, cap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS victory, though it augmented the renown of
Montrose, increased not his power nor numbers. The
far greater part of the kingdom were extremely attached
to the covenant; and such as bore an affection to the
royal cause, were terrified by the established authority of
the opposite party. Dreading the superior power of
Argyle, who, having joined his vassals to a force levied
by the public, was approaching with a considerable
army; Montrose hastened northwards, in order to rouze
again the Marquess of Huntley and the Gordons, who,
having before hastily taken arms, had been instantly sup∣pressed
by the covenanters. He was joined on his march
by the Earl of Airly, with his two younger sons, Sir
Thomas and Sir David Ogilvy: The eldest was, at that
time, a prisoner with the enemy. He attacked at Aber∣deen
the Lord Burley, who commanded a force of 2500
men. After a sharp combat, by his undaunted courage,
<PB N="48" REF="72"/>
which, his situation, was true policy, and was also
not unaccompanied with military skill, he put the ene∣my
to flight, and in the pursuit did great execution upon
them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">11th of September 1644. Rush. vol. vi. p. 983. Wishart, cap. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT by this second advantage, he obtained not the
end, which he proposed. The envious nature of Hunt∣ly,
jealous of Montrose's glory, rendered him averse to
join an army, where he himself must be so much eclipsed
by the superior merit of the general. Argyle, re-inforced
by the Earl of Lothian, was behind him with a great
army: The militia of the northern counties, Murray,
Ross, Caithness, to the number of 5000, opposed him
in front, and guarded the banks of the Spey, a deep and
rapid river. In order to elude these numerous armies,
he turned aside into the hills, and saved his weak, but
active troops, in Badenoch. After some marches and
counter-marches, Argyle came up with him at Faivy-castle.
This Nobleman's character, though celebrated
for political courage and conduct, was very low for mi∣litary
prowess; and after some skirmishes, in which he
was worsted, he here allowed Montrose to escape him.
By quick marches, through these inaccessible mountains,
that general freed himself from the superior forces of the
covenanters.</P>
<P>SUCH was the situation of Montrose, that very good
or very ill fortune was equally destructive to him, and
diminished his army. After every victory, his soldiers,
greedy of spoil, but deeming the smallest acquisition to
be unexhausted riches, deserted in great numbers, and
went home to secure the treasures, which they had ac∣quired.
Tired too, and spent with hasty and long
marches, in the depth of winter, through snowy moun∣tains,
unprovided of every necessary, they fell off, and
left their general almost alone with the Irish who, hav∣ing
<PB N="49" REF="73"/>
no place to which they could retire, still adhered to
him in every fortune.</P>
<P>WITH these, and some reinforcement of the Athole∣men,
and Macdonalds whom he had recalled, Montrose
fell suddenly upon Argyle's country, and let loose upon
it the whole rage of war; carrying off the cattle, burn∣ing
the houses, and putting the inhabitants to the sword.
This severity, by which Montrose sullied his victories,
was the result of private animosity against the chieftain,
as much as of zeal for the public cause. Argyle, col∣lecting
three thousand men, marched in quest of the ene∣my,
who had retired with their plunder; and he lay at
Innerlochy, supposing himself still at a considerable dis∣tance
from them. The Earl of Seaforth, at the head
of the garrison of Inverness, who were veteran soldiers,
joined to 5000 new levied troops of the northern coun∣ties,
pressed the royalists on the other side, and threaten∣ed
them with inevitable destruction. By a quick and
unexpected march, Montrose hastened to Innerlochy,
and presented himself in order of battle, before the sur∣prised,
but not affrighted, covenanters. Argyle alone,
seized with a panic, deserted his army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Feb.</NOTE> who still main∣tained
their ground, and gave battle to the royalists.
After a vigorous resistance, they were defeated, and pur∣sued
with great slaughter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 985. Wishart, cap. 8.</NOTE>. And the power of the
Campbels (that is Argyle's name) being thus broke;
the highlanders, who were in general well-affected to
the royal cause, began to join Montrose's camp, in great
numbers. Seaforth's army dispersed of itself, at the very
terror of his name. And the Lord Gordon, eldest son
to Huntley, having escaped from his uncle Argyle, who
had hitherto detained him, now joined Montrose, with
no contemptible number of his followers, attended by
his brother the Earl of Aboine.</P>

THE council at Edinburgh, alarmed at Montrose's
progress, began to think of a more regular plan of de∣fence,
against an enemy, whose repeated victories had
rendered him extremely formidable. They sent for
Baillie, an officer of reputation from England; and join∣ing
him in command with Urrey, who had again inlisted
himself among the King's enemies, they sent them to the
field, with a considerable army, against the royalists.
Montrose, with a detachment of 800 men, had attacked
Dundee, a town extremely zealous for the covenant:
And having carried it by assault, had delivered it up to
be plundered by his soldiers; when Baillie and Urrey,
with their whole force, were unexpectedly upon him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 228. Wishart, cap. 9.</NOTE>.
His conduct and presence of mind, in this emergence,
appeared conspicuous. Instantly he called off his sol∣diers
from plunder, put them in order, secured his re∣treat
by the most skilful measures; and having marched
sixty miles in the face of an enemy much superior, with∣out
stopping, or allowing his soldiers the least sleep or
refreshment, he at last secured himself in the moun∣tains.</P>
<P>BAILLIE and Urrey now divided their troops, in order
the better to conduct the war against an enemy, who
surprised them, as much by the rapidity of his marches,
as by the boldness of his enterprizes. Urrey, at the
head of 4000 men, met him at Alderne, near Inverness;
and, encouraged by the superiority of number (for the
covenanters were double the royalists,) attacked him in
the post which he had chosen. Montrose, having placed
his right wing in very strong ground, drew the best of
his forces to the other, and left no main body between
them; a defect which he artfully concealed, by showing
a few men thro' the trees and bushes, with which that
ground was covered. That Urrey might have no leisure
to perceive the stratagem, he instantly led his left wing
<PB N="51" REF="77"/>
to the attack; and, making a furious impression upon
the covenanters, drove them off the field, and obtained
a compleat victory<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 229. Wishart, cap. 10.</NOTE>. In this battle, the valour of young
Napier, son to the lord of that name, shone out with
signal lustre.</P>
<P>BAILLIE now advanced, in order to revenge Urrey's
discomfiture; but, at Alford, he met himself with a like
fate<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2d of July.</NOTE>. Montrose, weak in cavalry, lined his troops of
horse with infantry; and after putting the enemies horse
to rout, fell with united force upon their infantry, which
were entirely cut in pieces, though with the loss of the
gallant Lord Gordon on the part of the royalists<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 229. Wishart, cap. 11.</NOTE>. And
having thus prevailed in so many battles, which his vig∣our
ever rendered as decisive as they were successful; he
summoned together all his friends and confederates, and
prepared himself for marching into the southern pro∣vinces,
in order to put a total period to the power of the
covenanters, and dissipate the parliament, which, with
great pomp and solemnity, they had assembled at St.
Johnston's.</P>
<P>WHILE the fire was thus kindled in the north of the
island, it blazed out with no less fury in the south; and
the parliamentary and royal armies, as soon as the season
would permit, prepared to take the field, in hopes of
bringing their important quarrel to a quick decision.
The passing the self-denying ordinance had been pro∣tracted
by so many debates and intrigues, that the spring
was far advanced before it received the sanction of both
houses; and it was thought dangerous by many to
introduce, so near the time of action, such great innova∣tions
into the army. Had not the punctilious principles
of Essex engaged him, amidst all the disgusts which he
received, to pay implicit obedience to the parliament;
this alteration had not been effected without some fatal

accident: Since notwithstanding the prompt resignation
of his command, a mutiny was generally apprehended<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 126, 127.</NOTE>.
Fairfax, or more properly speaking, Cromwel under his
name, introduced, at last, the <HI>new model</HI> into the army,
and threw the whole troops into a different shape. From
the same men, new regiments and new companies were
formed, different officers appointed, and the whole mi∣litary
force put into such hands, as the independents
could rely on. Besides members of parliament who were
excluded, many officers unwilling to serve under the
new generals, threw up their commissions; and unwa∣rily
facilitated the project of putting the army entirely
into the hands of that saction.</P>
<P>THOUGH the discipline of the former parliamentary
army was not contemptible, a more exact plan was in∣troduced,
and rigorously executed, by these new com∣manders.
Valour indeed was very generally diffused
over the one party as well as the other, during this pe∣riod:
Discipline also was attained by the forces of the
parliament: But the perfection of the military art, in
concerting the general plans of action, and the opera∣tions
of the field, seems still, on both sides, to have
been, in a great measure, wanting. Historians at least,
perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience,
have not remarked any thing but a headlong impetuous
conduct; each party hurrying to a battle, where valour
and fortune chiefly determined the success. The great
ornament of history, during these reigns, are the civil,
not the military transactions.</P>
<P>NEVER surely was a more singular army assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New model of the army.</NOTE>
than that which was now set on foot by the parliament▪
To the greatest number of the regiments, chaplain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

duty, and united it with their military functions. Dur∣ing
<PB N="53" REF="81"/>
all the intervals of action, they occupied themselves
in sermons, prayers, exhortations; and the same emu∣lation,
there, attended them, which, in the field, is so
necessary to support the honour of that profession. Rap∣turous
ecstasies supplied the place of study and reflection;
and while the zealous devotees poured out their thoughts
in unpremeditated harangues, they mistook that elo∣quence,
which, to their own surprize, as well as that
of others, flowed in upon them, for divine illuminations,
and for illapses of the Holy Spirit. Wherever they were
quartered, they excluded the minister from his pulpit;
and, mounting that tribunal, conveyed their sentiments
to the audience, with all the authority, which followed
their power, their valour, their military exploits, united
to their appearing zeal and fervor. The private soldiers,
seized with the same spirit, employed their vacant hours
in prayer, in perusing the Holy Scriptures, in ghostly
conferences; where they compared the progress of their
souls in grace, and mutually stimulated each other to
farther advances in the great work of their salvation.
When marching to battle, the whole field resounded, as
well with psalms and spiritual songs adapted to the occa∣sion,
as with the instruments of military music<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 7. Rush. vol. vi. p. 281.</NOTE>; and
each man endeavoured to drown the sense of present dan∣ger,
in the prospect of that crown of glory which was set
before him. In so holy a cause, wounds were esteemed
meritorious; death, martyrdom; and the hurry and
dangers of action, instead of banishing their pious visions,
served rather to impress their minds more strongly with
them.</P>
<P>THE royalists endeavoured to throw a ridicule on this
fanaticism of the parliamentary armies, without being
sensible how much reason they had to apprehend its dan∣gerous
consequences. The forces, assembled by the King
at Oxford, in the west, and in other places, were equal,
<PB N="54" REF="82"/>
if not superior, in number, to their adversaries; but ac∣tuated
by a very different spirit. That licence, which
had been introduced by the want of pay, had risen to a
prodigious height among them, and rendered them more
formidable to their friends than to their enemies. Prince
Rupert, negligent of the people, fond of the soldiery,
had indulged the troops in very unwarrantable liberties:
Wilmot, a man of profligate manners, had promoted the
same spirit of disorder: And the licentious Goring, Ger∣rard,
Sir Richard Granville, now carried it to the great∣est
pitch of enormity. In the west especially, where
Goring commanded, universal spoil and havoc were com∣mitted;
and the whole country was laid waste by the
unbounded rapine of the army. All distinction of par∣ties
being in a manner dropped; the most devoted friends
of the church and monarchy wished there for such suc∣cess
to the parliamentary forces, as might put an end to
these oppressions. The country people, despoiled of
their substance, flocked together in several places armed
with clubs and staves; and though they professed an en∣mity
to the soldiers of both parties, their hatred was in
most places levelled chiefly against the royalists, from
whom they had met with the worst treatment. Many
thousands of these tumultuous peasants were assembled in
different parts of England; who destroyed all such
straggling soldiers as they met with, and much infested
the armies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. vii. p. 52, 61. 61. Whitlocke, p. 130, 131, 133, 135. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 665.</NOTE>.</P>

to great difficulties. The King, being joined by
the Princes, Rupert and Maurice, lay at Oxford, with
a considerable army, about 15000 men. Fairfax and
Cromwel were posted at Windsor, with the new model∣led
army, about 22,000 men. Taunton, in the county
of Somerset, defended by Blake, suffered a long siege
from Sir Richard Granville, who commanded an army
of about 8000 men; and though the defence had been
very obstinate, the garrison was now reduced to the last
extremity. Goring commanded, in the west, an army
of nearly the same number<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 18, 19, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON opening the campaign, the King formed the pro∣ject
of relieving Chester; Fairfax, that of relieving
Taunton. The King was first in motion. When he
advanced to Draiton in Shropshire, Biron met him,
and brought intelligence, that his approach had raised
the siege, and that the parliamentary army was drawn
off. Fairfax, having reached Salisbury in his road west∣ward,
received orders from the committee of both king∣doms
appointed for the management of the war, to re∣turn
and lay siege to Oxford, now exposed by the King's
absence. He obeyed, after sending Colonel Weldon to
the west, with a detachment of 4000 men. On Wel∣don's
approach, Granville, who imagined that Fairfax
with his whole army was upon him, raised the siege,
and allowed this pertinacious town, now half taken and
half burned, to receive relief: But the royalists, being
reinforced with 3000 horse under Goring, again advan∣ced
to Taunton, and shut up Weldon, with his small
army, in that ruinous place<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King having affected his purpose with regard to
Chester, returned southwards; and, in his way, sat
down before Leicester, a garrison of the parliament.
Having made a breach in the wall, he stormed the town
<PB N="56" REF="84"/>
on all sides; and, after a furious assault, the soldiers
entered sword in hand, committed all those disor∣ders,
to which their natural violence, especially when
enflamed by resistance, is so much addicted<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 652.</NOTE>. A great
booty was taken and distributed among them: Fifteen
hundred prisoners fell into the King's hands. This suc∣cess,
which struck a great terror into the parliamentary
party, determined Fairfax to leave Oxford, which he
was beginning to approach; and marched towards the
King, with an intention of offering him battle. The
King was advancing towards Oxford, in order to raise
the siege, which he apprehended was now begun; and
both armies, ere they were aware, had advanced within
six miles of each other. A council of war was called by
the King, in order to deliberate concerning the measures
which he should now pursue. On the one hand, it
seemed more prudent to delay the combat; because Ge∣rard,
who lay in Wales with 3000 men, might be en∣abled,
in a little time, to join the army; and Goring,
it was hoped, would soon be master of Taunton, and
having put the west in full security, would then unite
his forces to those of the King, and give him an incon∣testable
superiority over the enemy. On the other hand,
Prince Rupert, whose boiling ardour still pushed him on
to battle, excited the impatient humour of the nobility
and gentry, of which the army was full; and urged the
many difficulties under which the royalists laboured, and
from which nothing but a victory could relieve them:
The resolution was taken of giving battle to Fairfax;
and the royal army immediately advanced upon him.</P>
<P>AT Naseby was fought, with forces nearly equal, this
decisive and well-disputed field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Neseby.</NOTE> between the King and
parliament. The main body of the royalists was com∣manded
by the King: The right wing, by Prince Ru∣pert;
<PB N="57" REF="85"/>
The left, by Sir Marmaduke Langdale. Fairfax,
seconded by Skippon, placed himself in the main body
of the opposite army: Cromwel, in the right wing:
Ireton, Cromwel's son-in-law, in left. The charge
was begun, with his usual celerity and usual success, by
Prince Rupert. Tho' Ireton made ftout resistance, and
even after he was run through the thigh with a pike,
still maintained the combat, till he was taken prisoner;
yet was that whole wing broke, and pursued with pre∣cipitate
fury by Rupert: He was even so inconsiderate as
to lose time in summoning and attacking the artillery of
the parliament, which had been lest with a good guard
of infantry. The King led on his main body, and dis∣played,
in this action, all the conduct of a pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent ge∣neral,
and all the valour of a stout soldier<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 146.</NOTE>. Fairfax
and Skippon encountered him, and well supported that
reputation, which they had acquired. Skippon, being
dangerously wounded, was desired by Fairfax to leave
the field; but declared that he would remain there as
long as one man maintained his ground<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 43. Whitlocke, p. 145.</NOTE>. The infantry
of the parliament was broke, and pressed upon by the
King; tll Fairfax, with great presence of mind, brought
up the reserve and renewed the combat. Mean while,
Cromwel, having led on his troops to the attack of Lang∣dale,
overbore the force of the royalists, and by his pru∣dence
improved that advantage, which he had gained by
his valour. Having pursued the enemy about a quarter
of a mile, and detached some troops to prevent their ral∣lying;
he turned back upon the King's infantry, and
threw them into the utmost confusion. One regiment
alone preserved its order unbroken, tho' twice desperate∣ly
assailed by Fairfax: And that general, excited by so
steddy a resistance, ordered Doyley, the captain of his
life-guard, to give them a third charge in front, while
he himself attacked them in rear. The regiment was
<PB N="58" REF="86"/>
broke. Fairfax, with his own hands, killed an ensign,
and, having seized the colours, gave them to a soldier
to keep for him. The soldier afterwards boasting that
he had won this spoil, was reproved by Doyley, who had
seen the action; <HI>Let him retain that honour,</HI> said Fairfax,
<HI>I have to-day acquired enough beside</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE RUPERT, sensible too late of his error, left
the fruitless attack on the enemy's artillery, and joined
the King, whose infantry was now totally discomfited.
Charles exhorted this body of cavalry not to despair,
and cried aloud to them, <HI>One charge more, and we re∣cover
the day</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 44.</NOTE>. But the disadvantages, under which they
laboured, were too evident; and they could by no means
be induced to renew the combat. Charles was obliged
to quit the field, and leave the victory to the enemy<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon▪ vol. iv. p. 656, 657. Walker, p. 130, 131.</NOTE>.
The slain, on the side of the parliament, exceeded those
on the side of the King: They lost a thousand men;
he not above eight hundred. But Fairfax made 500 of∣ficers
prisoners and 4000 private men: Took all the
King's artillery and ammunition, and totally dissipated
his infantry: So that scarce any victory could be more
compleat, than that which he obtained.</P>
<P>AMONG the other spoils, was seized the King's cabi∣net,
with the copies of his letters to the Queen, which
the parliament afterwards ordered to be published<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iv p. 658.</NOTE>.
They chose, no doubt, such of them as they thought
would reflect most dishonour upon him: Yet upon the
whole, the letters are wrote with delicacy and tender∣ness,
and give an advantageous idea both of the King's
genius and morals. A mighty fondness, 'tis true, and
attachment, he expresses to his consort, and often pro∣fesses
that he never would embrace measures, disagree∣able
to her: But such declarations of civility and confi∣dence
<PB N="59" REF="87"/>
are not always to be taken in a literal sense. And
so legitimate an affection, avowed by the laws of God
and man, may, perhaps, be excusable towards a woman
of beauty and spirit, even tho' she was a papist<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Hearne has publish'd the following extract from a manuscript work of Six Simon D'Ewes, who was no mean man in the parliament party, “On Thursday the 30th and last day of this instant June 1625, I went to Whitehall, purposely to see the Queen, which I did fully all the time she sat at dinner. I perceiv'd had to be a most absolute delicate lady, after I had exactly survey'd all the features of her face, much enliven'd by her radiant and sparkling black eyes. Besides, her deportment among her wo∣men was so sweet and humble, and her speech and looks to her other ser∣vants so mild and gracious, as I could not abstain from divers deep fetched sighs, to consider, that she wanted the knowledge of the true religion.” See Preface to the Chronicle of Dunstable, p. 64.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Athenians, having intercepted a letter wrote by
their enemy, Philip of Macedon, to his wife Olympia;
so far from being moved by a curiosity of prying into
the secrets of that relation, immediately sent the letter
to the Queen unopened. Philip was not their sovereign;
nor were they enflamed with that violent animosity against
him, which attends all civil commotion.</P>
<P>AFTER the battle, the King retreated with that body
of horse, which remained intire, first to Hereford, then
to Abergavenny; and remained some time in Wales,
from the vain hope of raising a body of infantry in those
harrassed and exhausted quarters.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of June.</NOTE> Fairfax, having first
retaken Leicester, which was surrendered upon articles,
began to deliberate concerning his future enterprizes.
A letter was brought him, wrote by Goring to the King,
and unfortunately entrusted to a spy of Fairfax. Goring
informed the King, that, in three weeks time, he hoped
to be master of Taunton; after which he would join his
Majesty with all the forces of the west; and entreated
him, in the mean while, to avoid coming to any action
with the enemy. This letter, which, had it been safely
delivered, had probably prevented the battle of Naseby,

served now to direct the councils of Fairfax<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 49.</NOTE>. After
leaving a body of 3000 men to Pointz and Rossiter,
with orders to attend the King's motions, he marched
immediately to the west, with a view of saving Taun∣ton,
and suppressing the only considerable force which
now remained to the royalists.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the campaign, Charles, appre∣hensive
of the event, had sent the Prince of Wales, now
fifteen years of age, to the west, with the title of gene∣ral,
and had given orders, if he was pressed by the ene∣my,
that he should make his escape into a foreign coun∣try,
and save one part of the royal family from the vio∣lence
of the parliament. Prince Rupert had thrown
himself into Bristol, with an intention of defending that
important city. Goring commanded the army before
Taunton.</P>
<P>ON Fairfax's approach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of July.</NOTE> the siege of Taunton was
raised; and the royalists retired to Lamport, an open
town in the county of Somerset. Fairfax attacked them
in that post, beat them from it, killed about 300 men,
and took 1400 prisoners<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 55.</NOTE>. After this advantage, he sat
down before Bridgewater, a town esteemed strong, and
of great consequence in that country. When he had
entered the outer town by storm, Windham the go∣vernor,
who had retired into the inner, immediately ca∣pitulated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of July.</NOTE>
and delivered the place to Fairfax. The gar∣rison,
to the number of 2600 men, were made prisoners
of war.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX having next taken Bath and Sherborne, re∣solved
to sit down before Bristol; and made great prepa∣rations
for an enterprize, which, from the strength of
the garrison, and the reputation of Prince Rupert, the
governor, was deemed of the last importance. But, so
precarious in most men is this quality of military cou∣rage!
<PB N="61" REF="93"/>
a poorer defence was not made by any town,
during the whole war: And the general expectations
were here extremely disappointed. No sooner had the
parliamentary forces entered the lines by storm, than the
Prince capitulated, and delivered up the city to Fairfax<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 83.</NOTE>.
A few days before, he had wrote a letter to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Sept.</NOTE>
in which he undertook to defend the place for four
months, if no mutiny obliged him to surrender it. Charles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Surrender of Bristol.</NOTE>
who was forming schemes, and collecting forces, for
the relief of Bristol, was astonished at so unexpected an
event, which was little less fatal to his party than the
defeat at Naseby<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 690. Walker, p. 137.</NOTE>. Full of indignation, he instantly
recalled all Prince Rupert's commissions, and sent him a
pass to go beyond sea<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 695.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King's affairs now went fast to ruin in all quar∣ters.
The Scots, having made themselves masters of
Carlisle<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">28th of June.</NOTE>, after an obstinate siege, marched southwards,
and laid siege to Hereford; but were obliged to naise it
on the King's approach: And this was the last glimpse of
success, which attended his arms. Having marched to
the relief of Chester, which was a-new besieged by the
parliamentary forces under Colonel Jones; Pointz at∣tacked
his rear, and forced him to give battle. While
the fight was continued with great obstinacy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of Sept.</NOTE> and victory
seemed to incline to the royalists; Jones fell upon them
from the other side, and put them to rout, with the loss
of 600 slain and 1000 prisoners<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 117.</NOTE>. The King, with the
remains of his broken army, fled to Newark, and from
thence escaped to Oxford, where he shut himself up
during the winter season.</P>
<P>THE news, which he received from all sides, were no
less fatal than those events, which passed, where he him∣self
was present. Fairfax and Cromwel, after the sur∣render
<PB N="62" REF="94"/>
of Bristol, having divided their forces, the former
marched westwards, in order to compleat the conquest
of Devonshire and Cornwal; the latter attacked the
King's garrisons which lay to the east of Bristol. The
Devizes was surrendered to Cromwel; Berkeley castle
was taken by storm; Winchester capitulated; Basing-house
was entered sword in hand: And all these middle
counties of England were, in a little time, reduced to
obedience under the parliament.</P>
<P>The same rapid and uninterrupted success attended
Fairfax.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1646.</NOTE> The parliamentary forces, elevated by past
victories,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The west conquered by Fairfax.</NOTE> governed by the most rigid discipline, met with
no equal opposition from troops, dismayed by repeated
defeats, and corrupted by licentious manners. After
beating up the quarters of the royalists at Bovey-Tracy,
Fairfax sat down before Dartmouth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Jan.</NOTE> and in a few days
entered it by storm. Poudram castle being taken by him,
and Exeter blockaded on all sides; Hopton, a man of
merit, who now commanded the royalists, having ad∣vanced
to the relief of that town with an army of 8000
men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Feb.</NOTE> met with the parliamentary army at Torrington;
where he was defeated, all his foot dispersed, and he
himself with his horse obliged to retire into Cornwall▪
Fairfax followed him, and vigorously pursued the victo∣ry.
Having inclosed the royalists at Truro, he forced
the whole army, consisting of 5000 men, chiefly ca∣valry,
to surrender upon terms. The soldiers delivering
up their horses and arms, were allowed to disband, and
received twenty shillings a-piece, to carry them to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<PB N="63" REF="95"/>
after taking Exeter, which compleated the con∣quest
of the west, marched, with his victorious army,
to the centre of the kingdom, and fixed his camp at
Newbury. The Prince of Wales, in pursuance of the
King's orders, retired to Scilly, then to Jersey; from
whence he went to Paris; where he joined the Queen,
who had fled thither from Exeter, at the time the Earl
of Essex conducted the parliamentary army to the west.</P>
<P>IN the other parts of England, Hereford was taken
by surprize: Chester surrendered: Lord Digby, who
had attempted, with 1200 horse, to break into Scotland
and join Montrose, was defeated at Sherburn, in York∣shire,
by Colonel Copley; his whole force dispersed;
and he himself obliged to fly, first to the isle of Man,
and thence into Ireland. News too arrived that Mon∣trose
himself after some more successes, was at last rout∣ed;
and this only remaining hope of the royal party
finally extinguished.</P>
<P>WHEN Montrose descended into the southern counties,
the covenanters, assembling their whole force, met him
with a numerous army, and gave him battle, but with∣out
success, at Kilsyth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">15th of August 1645.</NOTE>. This was the most compleat
victory which Montrose ever obtained. The royalists
put to sword six thousand of their enemies, and left the
covenanters no remains of any army in Scotland. The
whole kingdom was shook with these repeated successes;
and many noblemen, who secretly favour'd the royal
cause, now declared openly for it, when they saw a force
able to support them. The Marquess of Douglass, the
Earls of Annandale and Hartfield, the Lords Fleming,
Seton, Maderty, Carnegy, with many others, flocked
to the royal standard. Edinburgh opened its gates, and
gave liberty to all the prisoners, which were there de∣tained
by the covenanters. Among the rest, was the

<P>DAVID LESLEY was detached from the army in Eng∣land,
and marched to the relief of his distressed party in
Scotland. Montrose advanced still farther to the south,
allured by vain hopes, both of rouzing to arms the Earls
of Hume, Traquaire, and Roxborough, who had pro∣mised
to join him; and of obtaining from England some
supply of cavalry, of which he stood in great need. By
the negligence of his scouts, Lesly, at Philip-haugh in
the Forrest, surprized his army, much diminished in
numbers, from the desertion of the Highlanders, who
had retired to the hills, according to custom, in order to
secure their plunder. After a sharp conflict, where
Montrose exerted the most heroic valour, his forces were
routed by Lesly's cavalry<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">13th of Sept. 1645.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defeat of Montrose.</NOTE> And he himself was obliged
to fly with his broken forces into the mountains; where
he again prepared himself for new battles and new enter∣prizes<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 231.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE covenanters used the victory with great rigout.
Their prisoners, Sir Robert Spotiswood, secretary of
state, and son to the late primate, Sir Pharlip Nisbet, Sir
William Rollo, Colonel Nathaniel Gordon, Andrew
Guthry, son to the bishop of Murray, William Murray,
son to the Earl of Tullibardine, were condemned and
executed. The sole crime, imputed to the secretary,
was the delivering to Montrose the King's commission to
be captain-general of Scotland. Lord Ogilvy, who was
again taken prisoner, would have undergone the same
fate, had not his sister found means to procure his escape,
by changing cloaths with him. For this instance of
courage and dexterity, she met with very harsh usage.
The clergy sollicited the parliament that more royalists
<PB N="65" REF="99"/>
might be executed; but could not obtain their re∣quest<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Guthry's Memoirs. Rush. vol. vii. p. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER all these repeated disasters, which every where,
be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el the royal party, there remained only one body of
troops, on which fortune could exercise her rigour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d March.</NOTE> Lord
Astley with a small army of 3000 men, chiefly cavalry,
marching to Oxford, in order to join the King, was
met at Stowe by Colonel Morgan, and utterly defeated;
himself being taken prisoner. “You have done your
work,” “said Astley to the parliamentary officers;
and may now go to play, unless you choose to fall out
among yourselves<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 141. It was the same Astley, who, before he charg'd at the Battle of Edgehill, made this short prayer, <HI>O Lord! thou knowest how busy I must be this day.

There were certainly much longer prayers said in the parliamentary army; but I doubt, if there was so good a one.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE condition of the King, during this whole win∣ter,
was, to the last degree, disastrous and melancholy.
As the dread of ills is commonly more oppressive than
their real presence, perhaps in no period of his life was
he more justly the object of compassion. His vigor of
mind, which, tho' it sometimes failed him in acting,
never deserted him in his sufferings, was what alone sup∣ported
him; and he was determined, as he wrote to
Lord Digby, if he could not live as a king to die like
a gentleman; nor should any of his friends, he said,
ever have reason to blush for the prince, whom they had
so unfortunately served<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Carte's Ormond, vol. iii. No. 433.</NOTE>. The murmurs of discontented
officers, on the one hand, harrassed their unhappy sove∣reign;
while they over-rated those services and suffer∣ings which, they now saw, must, for ever, be unre∣warded<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 147.</NOTE>. The affectionate duty, on the other hand, of
<PB N="66" REF="100"/>
his more generous friends, who respected his misfortunes
and his virtues, as much as his dignity, must have wrung
his heart with new sorrow; when he reflected, that such
disinterested attachment would so soon be exposed to the
rigour of his implacable enemies. Repeated attempts,
which he made for a peaceful and equitable accom∣modation
with the parliament, served to no purpose, but
to convince them that the victory was intirely in their
hands. They deigned not to make the least reply to se∣veral
of his messages, in which he desired a passport for
commissioners<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 215, &amp;c.</NOTE>. At last, after reproaching him with the
blood spilt during the war, they told him, that they were
preparing bills for him, and his passing them would be
the best pledge of his inclination towards peace: In
other words, he must yield at discretion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 217, 219. Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 744.</NOTE>. He desired a
personal treaty, and offered to come to London, upon
receiving a safe conduct for himself and his attendants:
They absolutely refused him access, and issued orders
for the guarding, that is, seizing his person, in case he
should attempt to visit them<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 249. Claren∣don, vol. iv. p. 741.</NOTE>. A new accident, which
happened in Ireland, served to inflame the minds of men,
and to increase those calumnies, with which his enemies
had so much loaded him, and which he ever regarded as
the most grievous part of his misfortunes.</P>
<P>AFTER the cessation with the Irish rebels, the King
was desirous of concluding a final peace with them, and
obtaining their assistance in England: And he gave au∣thority
to Ormond, Lord lieutenant, to promise them
an abrogation of all the penal laws, enacted against ca∣tholics;
together with the suspension of Poining's sta∣tute,
with regard to some particular bills, which should
be agred on. Lord Herbert, created Earl of Glamorgan,
(tho' his patent had not yet passed the seals) having occa∣sion,
<PB N="67" REF="101"/>
for his private affairs to go to Ireland, the King
considered that this Nobleman, being a catholic and
allied to the best Irish families, might be of service: He
also foresaw, that farther concessions with regard to reli∣gion
might probably be demanded by the bigoted Irish;
and that as these concessions, however necessary, would
give great scandal to the protestant zealots in his three
kingdoms, it would be requisite both to conceal them
during some time, and to preserve Ormond's character
by giving privately authority to Glamorgan to conclude
and sign these articles. But as he had a better opinion
of Glamorgan's zeal and affection for his service, than of
his capacity, he injoined him to communicate all his
measures to Ormond; and tho' the final conclusion of
the treaty must be performed only in Glamorgan's own
name, he was required to be directed, in the steps to∣wards
it, by the opinion of the Lord lieutenant. Gla∣morgan,
bigoted to his religion, and passionate for the
King's service, but guided in these pursuits by no manner
of judgment or discretion, secretly, of himself, without
any communication with Ormond, concluded a peace with
the council of Kilkenny, and agreed in the King's name,
that the Irish should enjoy all the churches, which they
had ever been in possession of, since the commencement
of their insurrection; on condition that they should as∣sist
the King in England with a body of ten thousand
men. This transaction was discovered by accident. The
titular archbishop of Tuam being killed by a sally of the
garrison of Sligo, the articles of the treaty were found
among his baggage, and were immediately published
every where, and copies of them sent over to the Eng∣lish
parliament<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 239.</NOTE>. The Lord lieutenant and Lord Digby,
foreseeing the clamour which would be raised against the
King, committed Glamorgan to prison, charged him with
high treason for his temerity, and maintained that he
<PB N="68" REF="102"/>
had acted altogether without any authority from his Ma∣jesty.
The English parliament likewise neglected not so
favourable an opportunity of reviving the old clamour
with regard to the King's favour of popery, and accused
him of delivering over, in a manner, the whole kingdom
of Ireland to that hated sect. The King told them,
“That the Earl of Glamorgan having made an offer
unto him to raise forces in the kingdom of Ireland,
and to conduct them into England for his Majesty's
service, had a commission to that purpose, and to that
purpose only, and that he had no commission at all to
treat of any thing else, without the privity and di∣rection
of the Lord lieutenant, much less to capitu∣late
any thing concerning religion, or any property
belonging either to church or laity.”<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch, p. 119.</NOTE> Tho' this de∣claration
seems to be agreeable to truth, it gave no sa∣tisfaction
to the parliament; and some historians, even at
present, when the antient bigotry is universally abated,
are desirous of representing this very innocent tran∣faction,
in which the King was engaged by the most vio∣lent
necessity, as a stain on the memory of that unfor∣tunate
prince<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Birch has wrote a treatise on this subject, with all that care and ac∣curacy, by which he has been enabled to throw light on many passages of the English history. It is not my business to oppose any facts contained in that gentleman's performance. I shall only produce arguments, which prove that Glamorgan, when he received his private commission, had injunctions from the King to act altogether in concert with Ormond. 1. It seems to be imply'd in the very words of the Commission. Glamorgan is empowered and authorised to treat and conclude with the confederate Roman catholics in Ireland. “If upon necessity any (<HI>articles</HI>) be condescende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto, wherein the King's lieutenant cannot so well be seen in, as not fit for us at present publickly to own.” Here no articles are mentioned, which are not fit to be communicated to Ormond, but only not fit for him and the King publickly to be seen in, and to ayow. 2. The King's protestation to Ormond, ought, both on account of that prince's character, and the reasons he assigns, to have the greatest weight. The words are these, “Ormond, I cannot but add to my long letter, that, upon the word of a christian, I never intend∣ed Glamorgan should treat any thing without your approbation, much less without your knowledge. For besides the injury to you, I was always dif∣fident of his judgment (though I could not think him so extremely weak as now to my cost I have found;) which you may easily perceive in a post∣script of a letter of mine to you.” Carte, vol. ii. App. xxiii. It is im∣possible, that any man of honour, however he might dissemble with his ene∣mies, would assert a falsehood in so solemn a manner to his best friend; especially where that person must have had opportunities of knowing the truth. The letter, whose postscript is mentioned by the King, is to be found in Carte, vol. ii. App. xiii. 3. Mr. Carte has published a whole series of the King's correspondence with Ormond, from the time that Glamorgan came into Ire∣land; and it is evident that Charles all along considers the lord lieutenantas the only person who was conducting the negotiations with the Irish. The 31st of July 1645, after the battle of Naseby, being reduced to great straits, he writes earnestly to Ormond to conclude a peace upon certain conditions mentioned, much inferior to those granted by Glamorgan; and to come over himself with all the Irish he could engage in his service. Carte, vol. iii. No. 400. This would have been a great absurdity, if he had already fixed a different canal, by which, on very different conditions, he proposed to establish a peace. On the 22d of October, as his distresses multiply, he somewhat enlarges the con∣ditions, though they still fall short of Glamorgan's: A new absurdity! See Carte, vol. iii. p. 411. 4. But what is equivalent to a demonstration, that Glamorgan was conscious that he had no powers to conclude a treaty on these terms, or without consulting the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord lieutenant, and did not even expect, that the King would ratify the articles, is the defeazance, which he gave to the Irish council at the time of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igning the treaty. “The Earl of Glamor∣gan does no way intend hereby to oblige his Majesty other than he himself shall please, after he has received these 10,000 men, as a pledge and testi∣mony of the said Roman catholics' loyalty and fidelity to his Majesty; yet he promises faithfully, upon his word and honour, not to acquaint his Ma∣jesty with this defeazance, till he had endeavoured, as far as in him lay, to induce his Majesty to the granting of the particulars in the said articles: But that done, the said commissioners discharge the said Earl of Glamorgan, both in honour and conscience, of any farther engagement to them there∣in; though his Majesty should not be pleased to grant the said particulars in the articles mentioned; the said Earl having given them assurance, upon his word, honour, and voluntary oath, that he would never, to any person whatsoever, discover this defeazance in the interim without their consents.” Dr. Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, p. 96. All Glamorgan's view was to get troops for the King's service, without hurting his own honour or his master's. The wonder only is, why the Irish accepted a treaty, which bound no body, and which the very person, who concludes it, seems to confess he does not expect to be ra∣tified. They probably hoped, that the King would from their services, be more easily induced to ratify a treaty which was concluded, than to consent to its conclusion.</P>
<P>This note is somewhat different from that published in the first edition. On a review, I do not find that the King ever positively affirmed that Glamor∣gan's powers were forgeries. He says not so in his declaration to the parlia∣ment above-cited. In his letter to Ormond and the Irish council, he seems even to acknowledge their reality; at least says that he might possibly have given him some powers to treat; though he always enjoined him to act in subordination to the lord lieutenant. Carte, vol. iii. p. 425.</P>
<P>Dr. Birch, in page 360, has published a letter of the King's to Glamorgan, where he says, “Howbeit I know you cannot be but confident of my mak¦ing good all instructions and promises to you and the nuncio.” But it is to be remarked, that this letter is dated in April 5, 1646; after there had been a new negotiation entered into between Glamorgan and the Irish, and after a provisional treaty had even been concluded between them. See Dr. Birch, p. 179. The King's assurances, therefore, can plainly relate only to this recent transaction. The old treaty had long been disa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owed by the King and supposed by all parties to be annulled.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="103"/>
HAVING lost all hope of prevailing over the rigour of
the parliament, either by arms or by treaty, the only re∣source,
<PB N="70" REF="104"/>
which remained to the King, consisted in the
intestine dissentions, which ran very high among the
parties. Presbyterians and independents, even before
their victory was fully compleated, fell into high con∣tests
about the division of the spoil, and their religious
as well as civil disputes agitated the whole nation.</P>
<P>THE parliament, though they had very early abolished
episcopal authority, had not, during so long a time,
substituted any other in its place; and their committees
of religion had hitherto assumed the whole ecclesiastical
jurisdiction: But they now established, by an ordinance,
the presbyterian government in all its forms of <HI>congrega∣tional,
classical, provincial,</HI> and <HI>national</HI> assemblies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiastical affairs.</NOTE> All
the inhabitants of each parish were ordered to meet and
chuse elders, on whom, together with the minister, was
bestowed the intire direction of all spiritual concerns
within the congregation. A number of neighbouring
<PB N="71" REF="105"/>
parishes, commonly between twelve and twenty, formed
a classis; and the court, which governed this division,
was composed of all the ministers, together with two,
three, or four elders chosen from each parish. The pro∣vincial
assembly retained an inspection over several neigh∣bouring
classes, and was composed intirely of clergy∣men:
The national assembly was constituted in the
same manner; and its authority extended over the whole
kingdom. 'Tis probable, that the tyranny exercised by
the Scots clergy, had given warning not to allow lay∣men
a place in the provincial or national assemblies; lest
the nobility and more considerable gentry, solliciting a
seat in these great ecclesiastical courts, should bestow a
consideration upon them, and render them, in the eyes
of the multitude, a rival to the parliament. In the in∣ferior
courts, the mixture of the laity might serve rather
to temper the zeal of the clergy<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 224.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though the presbyterians, by the establishment
of parity among the ecclesiastics, were so far gratified,
they were denied satisfaction in several other points, on
which they were extremely intent. The assembly of
divines had voted presbytery to be of divine right: The
parliament refused their assent to that decision<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 106. Rush. vol. vii. p. 260, 261.</NOTE>. Selden,
Whitelock, and other political reasoners, assisted by the
independents, had prevailed in this important delibera∣tion.
They thought, that had the bigoted religonists
been able to get their heavenly charter recognized, the
presbyters would soon become more dangerous to the
magistrate than had ever been the prelatical clergy.
These latter, while they claimed to themselves a divine
right, admitted of a like origin to civil authority: The
former, challenging to their own order a celestial pedigree,
derived the legislative power from no more dignified a
source than the voluntary association of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="106"/>
UNDER colour of keeping the sacraments from profana∣tion,
the clergy of all christian sects had assumed, what
they call the power of the keys, or the right of fulmi∣nating
excommunication. The example of Scotland
was a sufficient lesson for the parliament to make
provision against so severe a tyranny. They determined,
by an ordinance, all the cases in which excommunica∣tion
could be used. They allowed of appeals to the par∣liament
from all ecclesiastical courts. And they appoint∣ed
commissioners in each province to judge of such cases
as fell not within their ordinance<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 210.</NOTE>. So much civil au∣thority,
intermixed with the ecclesiastical, gave disgust
to all the zealots.</P>
<P>BUT nothing was attended with more universal scan∣dal
than the propensity of many in the parliament to∣wards
a toleration of the protestant sectaries. The pres∣byterians
exclaimed, that this indulgence made the
church of Christ resemble Noah's ark, and rendered it a
receptacle for all unclean beasts. They insisted, that
the least of Christ's truths was superior to all political
considerations<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 308.</NOTE>. They maintained the eternal obligation
of their covenant to extirpate heresy and schism. And
they menaced all their opponents with the same rigid
persecution, of which they had, themselves, so loudly
complained, when held in subjection by the hierarchy.</P>
<P>So great prudence and reserve, in such material points,
does great honour to the parliament; and proves, that
notwithstanding the prevalence of bigotry and fanati∣cism,
there were many members, who had more enlarg∣ed
views, and paid regard to the civil interests of society.
These men, uniting themselves to the enthusiasts, whose
genius, is naturally averse to clerical usurpations, exer∣cised
so jealous an authority over the assembly of divines,
that they allowed them nothing but the liberty of ten∣dering
<PB N="73" REF="107"/>
advice, and would not entrust them even with
the power of electing their own chairman or his substi∣tute,
or of supplying the vacancies of their own mem∣bers.</P>
<P>WHILE the disputes were canvassed by theologians,
who engaged in their spiritual contests every order of
the state; the King, though he entertained hopes of
reaping advantage from these divisions, was much at a
loss what side it would be most for his interest to comply
with. The presbyterians were, by their principles, the
least averse to regal authority; but were rigidly bent on
the extirpation of prelacy: The independents were reso∣lute
to lay the foundations of a republican government;
but as they pretended not to erect themselves into a na∣tional
church, it might be hoped, that, if gratified with
a toleration, they would admit the re-establishment of
the hierarchy. So great attachment had the King to
episcopal jurisdiction, that he was ever inclined to put it
in ballance even with his own power and kingly office.</P>
<P>BUT whatever advantage he might propose to reap
from the divisions of the parliamentary party, he was
apprehensive, that it would come too late, to save him
from that destruction with which he was instantly
threatened. Fairfax was approaching with a powerful
and victorious army, and was taking the proper mea∣sures
for laying siege to Oxford, which must infallibly
fall into his hands. To be taken captive, and led in
triumph by his insolent enemies, was what Charles justly
abhorred; and every insult, if not violence, was to be
dreaded, from that enthusiastic soldiery, who hated his
person, and despised his dignity. In this desperate ex∣tremity,
he embraced a measure, which, in any other
situation, might justly lie under the imputation of im∣prudence
and indiscretion.</P>

MONTREVILLE, the French minister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1649.</NOTE> interested for
the King more by the natural sentiments of humanity,
than any instructions from his court, which seemed ra∣ther
to favour the parliament, had sollicited the Scots ge∣nerals
and commissioners, to give protection to their dis∣tressed
sovereign; and having received many general pro∣fessions
and promises, he had always transmitted these,
perhaps with some exaggeration, to the King. From
his suggestions, Charles began to entertain thoughts of
leaving Oxford, and flying to the Scots army, which at
that time lay before Newark<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 750. vol. v. p. 16.</NOTE>. He considered that the
Scots nation had been fully gratified in all their de∣mands;
and having already, in their own country, an∣nihilated
both episcopacy and regal authority, had no
farther concessions to exact of him. In all disputes,
which had passed about settling the terms of peace, the
Scots, he heard, had still adhered to the milder side, and
had endeavoured to soften the rigour of the English par∣liament.
Great disgusts also, on other accounts, had
taken place between the nations; and the Scots found,
that, in proportion as their assistance became less neces∣sary,
less value was put upon them. The progress of
the independents gave them great alarm; and they were
scandalized to hear their beloved covenant spoken of
every day, with less regard and reverence. The refusal
of a divine right to presbytery, and the infringing eccle∣siastical
discipline from political considerations, were, to
them, the subject of much offence; and the King hoped,
that, in their present disposition, the sight of their na∣tive
prince, flying to them in this extremity of distress,
would rouze every spark of generosity in their bosom,
and procure him their favour and protection.</P>
<P>THAT he might the better conceal his intention, orders
were given at every gate in Oxford, for allowing three per∣sons
to pass; and in the night, the King, accompanied
<PB N="75" REF="111"/>
only with Dr. Hudson and Mr. Ashburnham, went out at
that gate, which leads to London. He rode before a
portmanteau, and called himself Ashburnham's servant.
He passed through St. Albans, Henley, and came so near
London as Harrow on the Hill. He once entertained
some thoughts of entering into this city, and of throw∣ing
himself on the mercy of the parliament. But at last,
after passing through many cross roads, he arrived at the
Scots camp before Newark<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 267.</NOTE>. The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th of May.</NOTE> hearing
of his escape from Oxford, issued rigorous orders, and
threatened with instant death, whoever should harbour
or conceal him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 209.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Scots generals and commissioners affected great<NOTE PLACE="marg">King goes to the Scots camp at Newark.</NOTE>
surprize at the appearance of the King: And though
they payed him all the exterior respect due to his dig∣nity,
they instantly put a guard upon him, under colour
of protection; and made him in reality a prisoner.
They informed the English parliament of this unexpect∣ed
incident, and assured them, that they had entered in∣to
no private treaty with the King. They applied to
him for orders to Bellasis, governor of Newark, to sur∣render
that town, now reduced to extremity; and the
orders were instantly obeyed. And hearing that the par∣liament
laid claim to the entire disposal of the King's
person, and that the English army were making some
motions towards them; they thought proper to retire
northwards, and fixed their camp at Newcastle<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 271. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS measure was very agreeable to the King; and he be∣gan
to entertain hopes of protection from the Scots. He was
particularly attentive to the behaviour of their preachers,
on whom all depended. It was the mode of that age
to make the pulpit the scene of news; and on every
great event, the whole Scripture was ransacked by the
clergy, for passages applicable to the present occasion.

The first minister who preached before the King, chose
these words for his text. “And behold all the men of Israel
came to the king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1656.</NOTE> and said unto him, Why have our
brethren the men of Judah, stolen thee away, and
have brought the king and his houshold, and all Da∣vid's
men with him, over Jordan? And all the men
of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the
king is near of kin to us; wherefore then be ye angry
for this matter? Have we eaten at all of the King's
cost? or hath he given us any gift? And the men of
Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, we have
ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
David than ye: Why then did ye despise us, that our
advice should not be first had in bringing back our
king? And the words of the men of Judah were
fiercer than the words of the men of Israel<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. chap. xix. 41, 42, and 43 verses. See Clarendon, vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p. 23, 24.</NOTE>.” But
the King soon found, that the happiness of the allusion
chiefly had tempted the preacher to employ this text,
and that the covenanting zealots were no wise pacified
towards him. Another preacher, after reproaching him
to his face, with his misgovernment, ordered this psalm
to be sung;
<Q><L>Why dost thou, tyrant, boast thyself</L>
<L>Thy wicked deeds to praise:</L></Q>
The King stood up, and called for that psalm which be∣gins
with these words,
<Q><L>Have mercy, Lord, on me, I pray;</L>
<L>For men would me devour:</L></Q>
The good-natured audience, in pity to fallen majesty
showed, for once, greater deference to the King than t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="77" REF="115"/>
the minister, and sung the psalm which the former had
called for<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 234.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES had very little reason to be pleased with his
situation. Not only he found himself a prisoner, very
narrowly guarded: All his friends were kept at a dis∣tance;
and no intercourse, either by letters or conver∣sation,
was allowed him with any one, on whom he
could depend, or who was suspected of any attachment
to him. The Scots generals would enter into no confi∣dence
with him; and still treated him with distant cere∣mony
and feigned respect. And every proposal, which
they made him, tended farther to his abasement and his
ruin<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY required him to issue orders to Oxford, and all
his other garrisons, commanding their surrender to the
parliament: And the King, sensible that their resistance
was to very little purpose, willingly complied. The
terms which were given to most of them, were honour∣able;
and Fairfax, as far as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay in his power, was very
exact in observing them. Far from allowing violence;
he would not even permit insults or triumph over the un∣fortunate
royalists; and by his generous humanity, so
cruel a civil war ended, in appearance, very calmly, be∣tween
the parties.</P>
<P>ORMOND having received like orders, delivered Dub∣lin,
and other forts, into the hands of the parliamentary
officers. Montrose also, after having experienced still
more variety of good and bad fortune, threw down his
arms, and retired out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Marquess of Worcester, a man past eighty-four,
was the last in England who submitted to the authority
of the parliament. He defended Raglan castle to extre∣mity;
and opened not its gates till the middle of August.
Four years, a few days excepted, were now elapsed, since
<PB N="78" REF="116"/>
the King, first erected his standard at Nottingham<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 293.</NOTE>. So
long had the British nations, by civil and religious quar∣rels,
been occupied in shedding their own blood, and
laying waste their mother-country.</P>
<P>THE parliament and the Scots laid their proposals be∣fore
the King. They were such as a captive, entirely
at mercy, could expect from the most inexorable victor:
Yet were they little worse than what were insisted on
before the battle of Naseby. The power of the sword,
instead of ten, which the King now offered, was de∣manded
for twenty years, together with a right to levy
whatever money the parliament should think proper for
the support of their armies. The other conditions were,
in the main, the same with those which were formerly
offered to the King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 309.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES said, that proposals, which introduced such
important innovations in the constitution, demanded
time for deliberation: The commissioners replied, that
he must give his answer in ten days<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol vii. p. 319.</NOTE>. He desired to
reason about the meaning and import of the terms:
They informed him, that they had no power of debate;
and required peremptorily his consent or refusal. He re∣quested
a personal treaty with the parliament: They
threatened, that, if he delayed compliance, the parlia∣ment
would, by their own authority, settle the nation.</P>
<P>WHAT the parliament was most intent upon, was not
the treaty with the King, to whom they paid little re∣gard;
but that with the Scots nation. Two important
points remained to be settled with them; their delivery
of the King, and the estimation of their arrears.</P>
<P>THE Scots pretended, that, as Charles was King of
Scotland as well as of England, they were intitled to an
equal vote in the disposal of his person: And that, in
such a case, where the titles are equal, and the subject
<PB N="79" REF="117"/>
indivisible, the preference was due to the present posses∣sor.
The English maintained, that, the King, being
in England, was comprehended within the jurisdiction
of that kingdom, and could not be disposed of by any
foreign nation. A delicate question this, and what surely
could not be decided by precedent; since such a situa∣tion
is not, any where, to be found in history<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the Scots concurred with the English, in imposing
such rigorous conditions on the King, that, notwith∣standing
his unfortunate situation, he still refused to ac∣cept
of them; it is certain, that they did not desire his
freedom: nor could they ever intend to join lenity and
tyranny together, in so inconsistent a manner. Before
the settlement of terms, the administration must be pos∣sessed
intirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms; and
how incompatible that scheme with the liberty of the
King, is easily imagined. To carry him a prisoner into
Scotland, where few forces could be supported in order
to guard him, was a measure so full of inconvenience
and danger, that, even if the English had consented to
it, it must have appeared to the Scots nation altogether
ineligible: And how could such a plan be supported in
opposition to England, possessed of such numerous, and
victorious armies, which were, at that time, or at least,
seemed to be, in intire union with the parliament? The
only expedient, it is obvious, which the Scots could
embrace, if they scrupled intirely to abandon the King,
was immediately to return, fully and cordially, to their
allegiance; and, uniting themselves with the royalists
of both kingdoms, endeavour, by force of arms, to re∣duce
the English parliament to more moderate condi∣tions:
But besides that this measure was full of extreme
hazard; what was it but instantly to combine with
their old enemies against their old friends, and in a fit of
romantic generosity, overturn what, with so much ex∣pence
<PB N="80" REF="118"/>
of blood and treasure, they had, during the course
of so many years, been so carefully erecting?</P>
<P>BUT, though all these reflections occurred to the Scots
commissioners, they resolved to prolong the dispute, and
to keep the King as a pledge for those arrears, which
they claimed from England, and which they were not
likely, in the present disposition of that nation, to ob∣tain
by any other expedient. The sum, by their ac∣count,
amounted to two millions: For they had receiv∣ed
very little regular pay, since they had entered Eng∣land.
And though the contributions which they had
levied, as well as the price of their living on free quar∣ters,
must be deducted; yet still the sum, which they
insisted on, was very considerable. After many discus∣sions,
it was, at last, agreed, that, in lieu of all de∣mands,
they should accept of 400,000 pounds, one half
to be paid instantly, another within a twelve-month<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 326.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREAT pains were taken by the Scots (and the Eng∣lish
complied with their pretended delicacy) to make this
estimation and payment of arrears appear a quite diffe∣rent
transaction from that for the delivery of the King's
person: But common sense requires, that they should
be regarded as one and the same. The English, it is
evident, had they not been previously assured of receiv∣ing
the King, would never have parted with so consi∣derable
a sum, and, while they weakened themselves, by
the same measure have strengthened a people, with
whom they should afterwards have so material an interest
to discuss.</P>
<P>THUS the Scots nation underwent, and still undergo
(for such grievous stains are not easily wiped off) the re∣proach
of selling their King, and bargaining their prince
for money. In vain, did they maintain, That this
money was, on account of former services, un∣doubtedly
<PB N="81" REF="119"/>
their due; that in their present situation, no
other measure, without the utmost indiscretion, or even
their apparent ruin, could be embraced; that though
they delivered their King into the hands of his open
enemies, they were themselves as much his open ene∣mies
as those to whom they surrendered him, and their
common hatred against him had long united the two par∣ties
in strict alliance with each other. They were still
answered, that they made use of this scandalous expe∣dient
to obtain their wages; and that, after taking
arms, without any provocation, against their sovereign,
who had ever loved and cherished them, they had de∣servedly
fallen into a situation, from which they could
not extricate themselves, without either infamy or im∣prudence.</P>
<P>THE infamy of this bargain had such influence on the
Scots parliament, that they once voted, that the King
should be protected and his liberty insisted on. But the
general assembly interposed, and pronounced, that, as
he had refused to take the covenant, which was pressed
on him, it became not the godly to concern themselves
about his fortunes. After this declaration, it behoved
the parliament to retract their vote.</P>
<P>INTELLIGENCE of the final resolution of the Scots
nation to deliver him up, was brought to the King;
and he happened, at that very time, to be playing at

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1647.</NOTE> THE King, being delivered over by the Scots to the
English commissioners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King deliver∣ed up by the Scots.</NOTE> was conducted, under a guard,
to Holmby, in the county of Northampton. On his
journey, the whole country flocked to behold him,
moved partly by curiosity, partly by compassion and af∣fection.
If any still retained rancour against him, in his
present condition, they passed in silence; while his well-wishers,
more generous than prudent, accompanied his
march with tears, with acclamations, and with prayers
for his safety<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ludlow, Herbert.</NOTE>. That ancient superstition likewise, of
desiring the King's touch in scrophulous distempers,
seemed to acquire fresh credit among the people, from
the general tenderness, which began to prevail for this
virtuous and unhappy monarch.</P>
<P>THE commissioners rendered his confinement at
Holmby very rigorous; dismissing all his antient ser∣vants,
debarring him from all visits, and cutting off all
communication with his friends or family. The parlia∣ment,
though earnestly applied to by the King, refused
to allow his chaplains to attend him; because they had
not taken the covenant. The King refused to assist at
the service, exercised according to the Directory; be∣cause
he had not, as yet, given his consent to that mode
of worship<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 39. Warwick, p. 298</NOTE>. Such religious zeal prevailed on both

misfortune. Fully sensible of the mischievous extremi∣ties,
to which affairs had been carried, and of the worse
consequences, which were still to be apprehended; he
had resolved to conciliate a peace, and to remedy, as far
as possible, all those ills, to which, from mistake, ra∣ther
than any bad intentions, he had himself so much
contributed. The presbyterian, or the moderate party
among the commons, found themselves considerably
weakened by his death: And the small remains of
authority, which still adhered to the house of peers,
were, in a manner, wholly extinguished<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 43.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE dominion of the parliament was of very
short duration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LIX.</NOTE> No sooner had they subdued
their sovereign, than their own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> up against

nothing remained to confine the wild projects of zeal and
ambition. And every successive revolution became a
precedent for that which followed it.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the terror of the King's power dimi∣nished,
the divisions between independent and presbyte∣rian
became every day more apparent; and the neuters
found it, at last, requisite to seek shelter in one or the
other faction. Many new writs were issued for elections,
in room of members, who had died, or were disqualified
for adhering to the King; yet still the presbyterians re∣tained
the superiority among the commons: And all the
peers, except Lord Say, were esteemed of that party.
The independents, to whom all the inferior sectaries ad∣hered,
predominated in the army: And the troops of
the new model were universally affected with that en∣thusiastic
spirit. To their assistance did the independent
party, among the commons, chiefly trust, in their pro∣jects
for acquiring the ascendant over their antagonists.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="125"/>
SOON after the retreat of the Scots, the presbyterians,
seeing every thing reduced to obedience, began to talk of
dismissing a considerable part of the army: And, on pre∣tence
of easing the public burthens, they levelled a
deadly blow at the opposite faction. They proposed to
embark a strong detachment, under Skippon and Massey,
for the service of Ireland: They openly declared their
intention of making a great reduction of the remainder<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fourteen thousand men were only proposed to be kept up; 6000 horse, 6000 foot, and 2000 dragoons. Bates.</NOTE>.
It was even imagined, that another new model of the
army was projected, in order to regain to the presbyte∣rians,
that superiority, which they had so imprudently
lost by the former<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 564.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE army had small inclination to the service of Ire∣land;
a country barbarous, uncultivated, and laid waste
by massacres, and civil commotions: They had less in∣clination
to disband, and to renounce that pay, which,
having earned it through fatigues and dangers, they now
proposed to enjoy in ease and tranquillity. And most
of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> raised from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>egs of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
had no other prospect, if deprived of their commission,
than that of returning to languish in their native pover∣ty
and obscurity.</P>
<P>THESE motives of interest acquired additional in∣fluence,
and became more dangerous to the parlia∣ment,
from the religious spirit, by which the army was
universally animated. Among the generality of men,
educated in regular, civilized societies, the sentiments of
shame, duty, honour, have considerable authority, and
serve to counterballance and direct the motives, derived
from private advantage: But, by the predominancy of
enthusiasm among the parliamentary forces, all these sa∣lutary
principles lost their credit, and were regarded as
<PB N="86" REF="126"/>
mere human inventions, yea moral institutions, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itter
for heathens than for christians<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 134.</NOTE>. The saint, resigned
over to superior guidance, was at full liberty to gratify
all his appetites, disguised under the appearance of pious
zeal. And, besides the strange corruptions engendered
by this spirit, it eluded and loosened all the ties of mo∣rality,
and gave intire scope, and even sanction to the
selfishness and ambition, which naturally adhere to the
human mind.</P>
<P>THE military confessors were farther encouraged in
disobedience to superiors, by that spiritual pride, to which
a mistaken piety is so subject. They were not, they
said, mere janizaries; mercenary troops inlisted for hire,
and to be disposed of at the will of their paymasters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 565.</NOTE>.
Religion and liberty were the motives, which had excit∣ed
them to arms; and they had a superior right to see
those blessings, which they had purchased with their
blood, ensured to future generations. By the same title,
that the presbyterians, in contradistinction to the roy∣alists,
had appropriated to themselves the epithet of the
<HI>godly,</HI> or the <HI>well-affected</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 474.</NOTE>; the independents did now,
in contradistinction to the presbyterians, assume this
magnificent appellation, and arrogate all the ascendant,
which naturally belongs to it.</P>
<P>HEARING of parties in the house of commons, and
being informed, that the minority were friends to the
army, the majority enemies; the troops naturally inte∣rested
themselves in that dangerous distinction, and were
eager to give the superiority to their partizans. What∣ever
hardships they underwent, though perhaps derived
from inevitable necessity, were ascribed to a settled de∣sign
of oppressing them, and resented as an effect of the
animosity and malice of their antagonists.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="127"/>
NOTWITHSTANDING the great revenue, which ac∣crued
from taxes, assessments, sequestrations, and com∣positions,
considerable arrears were due to the army;
and many of the private men, as well as officers, had
near a twelvemonth's pay still owing them. The army
suspected, that this deficiency was purposely contrived,
in order to oblige them to live on free quarter; and, by
rendering them odious to the country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve as a pre∣tence
for disbanding them. When they saw such mem∣bers,
as were employed in committees and civil offices,
accumulate great fortunes, they accused them of rapine
and public plunder. And, as no plan was pointed out
by the commons for the payment of arrears, the soldiers
dreaded, that, after they should be disbanded or em∣barked
for Ireland, their enemies, who predominated in
the two houses, would intirely defraud them of their
right, and oppress them with impunity.</P>
<P>ON this ground or pretence did the first commotions
begin in the army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny of the army.</NOTE> A petition, addressed to Fairfax the
general, was handed about; desiring an indemnity, and
that ratified by the King, for any illegal actions, of
which, during the course of the war, the soldiers might
have been guilty; together with satisfaction in arrears,
freedom from pressing, relief of widows and maimed sol∣diers,
and pay till disbanded. The commons, aware of
what combustible materials the army was composed,
were alarmed at this intelligence. Such a combination,
they knew, if not checked in its first appearance, must
be attended with the most dangerous consequences, and
must soon exalt the military above the civil authority.
Besides summoning some officers to answer for this at∣tempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30.</NOTE>
they immediately voted, that the petition tended
to introduce mutiny, to put conditions upon the parlia∣ment,
and to obstruct the relief of Ireland; and they
threatened to proceed against the promoters of it, as ene∣mies
to the state, and disturbers of public peace. This

<PB N="87" REF="129"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="88" REF="130"/>
declaration, which may be esteemed violent, especially
as the army had some ground for complaint, produced
very fatal effects. The soldiers lamented, That they
were deprived of the privileges of Englishmen; that they
were not allowed so much as to represent their grievan∣ces;
that, while petitions from Essex and other places
were openly encouraged against the army, their mouths
were stopped; and that they, who were the authors of
liberty to the nation, were reduced, by a faction in par∣liament,
to the most grievous servitude.</P>
<P>IN this disposition was the army found by Warwic,
Dacres, Massey, and other commissioners; who were
sent to make them proposals for entering into the service
of Ireland<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 457.</NOTE>. Instead of inlisting, the generality ob∣jected
to the terms; demanded an indemnity; were cla∣morous
for their arrears: And, though they expressed
no dissatisfaction against Skippon, who was appointed
commander, they discovered much stronger inclination
to serve under Fairfax and Cromwel<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 458.</NOTE>. Some officers,
who were of the presbyterian party, having entered into
engagements for this service, could prevail on very few
of the soldiers to inlist under them. And, as they all
lay under the grievous reproach of deserting the army,
and betraying the interests of their companions; the rest
were farther confirmed in that confederacy, which they
had formed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 461. 556.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To petition and remonstrate being the most cautious
way of conducting a confederacy, an application to par∣liament
was signed by near 200 officers; in which they
made their apology with a very imperious air, asserted
their right of petitioning, and complained of that impu∣tation
thrown upon them by the former declaration of
the lower house<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 468.</NOTE>. The private men likewise of some
regiments sent a letter to Skippon; in which, together
<PB N="89" REF="131"/>
with insisting on the same topics, they lament, that designs
were formed against them and many of the godly party
in the kingdom; and declare, that they could not en∣gage
for Ireland, till they were satisfied in their expecta∣tions,
and had their just desires granted<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 474.</NOTE>. The army,
in a word, felt their power, and resolved to be masters.</P>
<P>THE parliament too resolved, if possible, to preserve
their dominion; but, being destitute of power, and not
retaining much authority, it was not easy for them to
employ any expedient, which could contribute to their
purpose. The expedient, which they now made use of,
was the worst imaginable. They sent Skippon, Crom∣wel,
Ireton, and Fleetwood, to the head-quarters at
Saffron-Weldon in Essex; and empowered them to make
offers to the army, and inquire into the cause of its
<HI>distempers.</HI> These very generals, at least the three last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of May.</NOTE>
were secretly the authors of all the discontents; and fail∣ed
not to foment those disorders, which they pretended to
appease. By their suggestion, a measure was embraced,
which, at once, brought matters to extremity, and ren∣dered
the mutiny incurable.</P>
<P>IN opposition to the parliament at Westminster, a mili∣tary
parliament was formed. Together with a council
of the principal officers, which was appointed after the
model of the house of peers; a more free representative
of the army was composed, by the election of two pri∣vate
men or inferior officers, under the title of agitators,
from each troop or company<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 485. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 43.</NOTE>. By this means, both
the general humour of that time was gratified, intent on
plans of imaginary republics; and an easy method con∣trived
for conducting underhand, and propagating the
sedition of the army.</P>
<P>THIS terrible court, when assembled; having first de∣clared,
<PB N="90" REF="132"/>
that they found no <HI>distempers</HI> in the army, but
many <HI>grievances,</HI> under which it laboured; immediately
voted the offers of the parliament unsatisfactory. Eight
weeks pay alone, they said, was promised; a small por∣tion
of fifty-six weeks, which they pretended to be their
due: No visible security was given for the remainder▪
And having been declared public enemies by the com∣mons,
they might hereafter be prosecuted as such, un∣less
the declaration was recalled<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 497, 505. Whitlocke, p. 250.</NOTE>. Before matters came
to this height, Cromwel had posted up to London, on
pretence of laying before the parliament the rising dis∣contents
of the army.</P>
<P>THE parliament made one vigorous effort more, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
try the force of their authority: They voted, that all
the troops, which did not engage for Ireland, should in∣stantly
be disbanded in their quarters<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vol. vii. p. 487.</NOTE>. At the same
time, the council of the army ordered a general rendez∣vous
of all the regiments, in order to provide for their
common interests. And while they thus prepared them∣selves
for opposition to the parliament, they struck <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
blow, which at once decided the victory in their fa∣vour.</P>
<P>A party of five hundred horse appeared at Holmby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of June. The King seized by Joyce.</NOTE>
conducted by one Joyce, who had once been a taylor
by profession; but was now advanced to the rank of cor∣net,
and was an active agitator in the army. Without
being opposed by the guard, whose affections were all
on the same side; Joyce came into the King's presence
armed with pistols, and told him, that he must imme∣diately
go along with him. <HI>Whither?</HI> said the King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>To the army;</HI> replied Joyce. <HI>By what warrant?</HI> asked th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
King. Joyce pointed to the soldiers, whom he brough<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
along; tall, handsome, and well accountered. <HI>Your war∣rant,</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="133"/>
said Charles smiling, <HI>is wrote in fair characters, le∣gible
without spelling</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 254. Warwick, p. 299.</NOTE>. The parliamentary commissioners
came into the room: They asked Joyce, whether he
had any orders from the parliament? He said, <HI>No:</HI> From
the general? <HI>No:</HI> By what authority he came? He
made the same reply as to the King: <HI>They would write,</HI>
they said, <HI>to the parliament to know their pleasure. You may
do so,</HI> replied Joyce; <HI>but in the mean time the King must
immediately go with me.</HI> Resistance was vain. The King,
after protracting the time as long as he could, went into
his coach; and was safely conducted to the army, who
were hastening to their rendezvous at Triplo-Heath near
Cambridge. The parliament, informed of this event by
their commissioners, were thrown into the utmost con∣sternation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 514, 515. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX himself was no less surprized at the King's
arrival. That bold measure, executed by Joyce, had
never been communicated to the general. The orders
were intirely verbal; and no body avowed them. And,
while every one affected astonishment at the enterprize,
Cromwel, by whose council it had been directed, ar∣rived
from London, and put an end to their delibera∣tions.</P>
<P>THIS artful and audacious conspirator had conducted
himself in the parliament with such profound dissimu∣lation,
with such refined hypocrisy, that he had long de∣ceived
those, who, being themselves very dextrous prac∣titioners
in the same arts, naturally entertained the more
suspicion against others. At every intelligence of dis∣orders
in the army, he was moved to the highest pitch of
grief and of anger. He wept bitterly: He lamented the
misfortunes of his country: He advised every violent
measure for suppressing the mutiny; and by these preci∣pitant
<PB N="92" REF="134"/>
councils, at once seemed to evince his own since∣rity,
and inflamed those discontents, of which he in∣tended
to make advantage. He obtested heaven and
earth, that his devoted attachment to the parliament had
rendered him so odious in the army, that his life, while
among them, was in the utmost danger; and he had
very narrowly escaped a conspiracy, formed to assassinate
him. But information being brought, that the most
active officers and agitators were intirely his creatures,
the parliamentary leaders secretly resolved, that, next
day, when he came to the house, an accusation should
be entered against him, and he should be sent to the
Tower<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 46.</NOTE>. Cromwel, who, in the conduct of his de∣sperate
enterprizes, frequently approached to the very
brink of destruction, knew how to make the requisite
turn with proper dexterity and boldness. Being informed
of this design, he hastened to the camp; where he was
received with acclamations of joy, and was instantly in∣vested
with the supreme command both of general and
army.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX, having neither talents himself for cabals,
nor penetration to discover the cabals of others, had
given his confidence intirely to Cromwel; who, by the
best coloured pretences, and by the appearance of an
open sincerity and a scrupulous conscience, imposed on
the easy nature of this brave and virtuous man. The
council of officers and the agitators were moved altoge∣ther
by Cromwel's direction, and conveyed his will to
the whole army. By his profound and artful conduct,
he had now attained a situation, where he could cover
his enterprizes from public view; and seeming either to
obey the commands of his superior officer, or yield to
the movements of the soldiers, could secretly pave the
way for his future greatness. While the disorders of the
army were yet in the infancy, he kept at a distance;
<PB N="93" REF="135"/>
lest his counterfeit aversion might throw a damp upon
them, or his secret encouragement beget suspicion in the
parliament. As soon as they came to maturity, he openly
joined the army; and in the critical moment, struck that
important blow of seizing the King's person, and de∣priving
the parliament of any resource by an accommo∣dation
with him. Tho' one vizor fell off, another still
remained, to cover his natural countenance. Where
delay was requisite, he could employ the most indefa∣tigable
patience: Where celerity was necessary, he flew
to a decision. And by thus uniting in his person the
the most opposite talents, he was enabled to combine the
most contrary interests in a subserviency to his secret
purposes.</P>
<P>THE parliament, tho' at present defenceless, were pos∣sessed
of many resources;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The army march against the parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and time might easily enable
them to resist that violence, with which they were threaten∣ed.
Without farther deliberation, therefore, Cromwel
advanced the army upon them, and arrived in a few days
at St. Albans.</P>
<P>NOTHING could be more popular, than this hostility,
which the army commenced against the parliament. As
much as that assembly was once the idol of the nation,
as much was it now become the object of general hatred
and aversion.</P>
<P>THE self-denying ordinance had no longer been put
in execution, than till Essex, Manchester, Waller, and
the other officers of that party, had resigned their com∣mission:
Immediately after, it was laid aside by tacit
consent; and the members, sharing all offices of power
and profit among them, proceeded with impunity in ex∣ercising
acts of oppression on the helpless nation. Tho'
the necessity of their situation might serve as an apology
for many of their measures, the people, not accustomed
to such a species of government, were not disposed to
make the requisite allowances.</P>

could be obtained only by paying large compositions
and subscribing the covenant; which they abhorred.
Besides the ruin and desolation of so many antient and
honourable families; indifferent spectators could not
but blame the hardship of punishing with such severity,
actions, which the law, in its usual and most undisputed
interpretation, strictly required of every subject.</P>
<P>THE severities too, exercised against the episcopal
clergy, naturally affected the royalists, and even all men
of candor, in a sensible manner. By the most mode∣rate
computation<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">See John Walker's attempt towards recovering an account of the num∣bers and sufferings of the clergy.

the established clergy had been turned out to beggary
and want, for no other crime than their adherence to the
civil and religious principles, in which they were edu∣cated;
and for their attachment to those laws, under
whose countenance they had at first embraced that pro∣fession.

to subscribe the covenant, were the only terms, which

called their oppressions the spoiling the Egyptians, and
their rigid severity the dominion of the Elect, interlard∣ed
all their iniquities with long and fervent prayers,
saved themselves from blushing by their pious grimaces,
and exercised, in the name of the Lord, all their cruelty
on men. An undisguised violence could be forgiven:
But such a mockery of the understanding, such an abuse
of religion, were, with men of penetration, objects of
peculiar resentment.</P>
<P>THE parliament, conscious of their decay in popula∣rity,
seeing a formidable armed force advance upon
them, were reduced to despair, and found all their re∣sources
much inferior to the present necessity. London
still retained a strong attachment to presbyterianism;
and its militia, which was numerous, and had acquired
reputation in the wars, had, by a late ordinance, been
put into hands, in whom the parliament could intirely
confide. This militia were now called out, and ordered
to guard the line, which had been drawn about the city,
in order to secure it against the King. A body of horse
was ordered to be instantly levied. Many officers, who
had been cashiered by the new model of the army, offered
their service to the parliament. An army of 5000 men
lay in the north under the command of General Pointz,
who was of the presbyterian faction; but these were too
distant to be employed in so urgent a necessity. The
forces, destined for Ireland, were quartered in the west;
and, though deemed faithful to the parliament, they al∣so
lay at a distance. Many inland garrisons were com∣manded
by officers of the same party; but their troops,
being so much dispersed, could, at present, be of no
manner of service. The Scots were faithful friends and
zealous for presbytery and the covenant: but a very
long time was required, ere they could collect their
forces, and march to the assistance of the parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="142"/>
IN this situation it was thought more prudent to sub∣mit,
and by compliance to stop the fury of the enraged
army. The declaration, by which the military peti∣tioners<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of June.</NOTE>
had been voted public enemies, was recalled,
and erazed from the journal-book<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 503. 547. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 45.</NOTE>. This was the first
symptom which the parliament gave of submission; and
the army, hoping, by terror alone, to effect all their
purposes, stopped at St. Albans, and entered into nego∣tiation
with their masters.</P>
<P>HERE commenced the encroachments of the military
upon the civil authority. The army, in their usurpa∣tions
on the parliament, copied exactly the model, which
the parliament had set them, in their recent usurpations
on the crown.</P>
<P>EVERY day, they rose in their demands. If one
claim was granted, they had another ready, still more
enormous and exorbitant; and were determined never to
be satisfied. At first, they pretended only to petition
for what concerned themselves as soldiers: Next, they
must have a vindication of their character: Then, it
was necessary, that their enemies be punished<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 509.</NOTE>: At last,
they claimed a right of modelling the whole govern∣ment,
and settling the nation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 567. 633. Ibid. vol. viii. p. 731.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY preserved, in words, all deference and respect
to the parliament; but in reality, insulted them and
tyrannized over them. That assembly they pretended
not to accuse: It was only evil counsellors, who seduced
and betrayed it.</P>
<P>THEY proceeded so far as to name eleven members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of June.</NOTE>
whom, in general terms, they charged with high trea∣son,
as enemies to the army and evil counsellors to the
parliament. Their names were Hollis, Sir Philip Sta∣pleton,
Sir William Lewis, Sir John Clotworthy, Sir
<PB N="99" REF="143"/>
William Waller, Sir John Maynard, Massey, Glyn,
Long, Harley, and Nichols<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 570.</NOTE>. These were the very
leaders of the presbyterian party.</P>
<P>THEY insisted, that these members should immediately
be sequestred from parliament, and be thrown into pri∣son<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 572.</NOTE>.
The commons replied, that they could not, up∣on
a general charge, proceed so far<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 592.</NOTE>. The army ob∣served
to them, that the cases of Strafford and Laud
were direct precedents for that purpose<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 594. Whitlocke, p. 259.</NOTE>. At last, the
eleven members themselves, not to give occasion to dis∣cord,
begged leave to retire from the house: and the
army, for the present, seemed satisfied with this proof of
submission<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 593, 594.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRETENDING, that the parliament designed to levy
war upon them, and to involve the nation again in blood
and confusion, they required, that all new levies should
be stopped. The parliament complied with this de∣mand<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 572. 574.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE being no signs of resistance, the army, in order
to save appearances, removed, at the desire of the par∣liament,
to a greater distance from London, and fixed
their head quarters at Reading. They carried the
King along with them in all their removes.</P>
<P>THAT Prince now found himself in a better situation
than at Holmby, and had attained some greater degree
of freedom, as well as of consideration with both par∣ties.</P>
<P>ALL his friends had access to him: His correspond∣ence
with the queen was not interrupted: His chaplains
were restored, and he was allowed the use of the liturgy:
His children were once allowed to visit him, and passed
a few days at Caversham, where he then resided<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 51, 52. 57.</NOTE>. He

had not seen the Duke of Glocester, his youngest son,
and the Princess Elizabeth, since he left London, at
the commencement of the civil disorders; nor the Duke
of York, since he went to the Scots army before New∣ark.
No private man, unacquainted with the pleasures
of a court, and the tumult of a camp, more passionately
loved his family▪ than did this good Prince; and such
an instance of indulgence in the army was extremely
grateful to him. Cromwel, who was witness to the
meeting of the royal family, confessed, that he never
had been present at so tender a scene; and he extremely
applauded the benignity, which displayed itself in the
whole disposition and behaviour of Charles.</P>
<P>THAT artful politician, as well as the leaders of all
parties, payed court to the King; and fortune, not∣withstanding
all his calamities, seemed again to smile
upon him. The parliament, afraid of his forming some
accommodation with the army, spoke to him in a more
respectful style than formerly; and invited him to reside
at Richmond, and contribute his assistance to the settle∣ment
of the nation. All the chief officers treated him
with great regard, and talked every where of restoring
him to his just powers and prerogatives. In the public de∣clarations
of the army, the settlement of his revenue and
authority was insisted on<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 590.</NOTE>. The royalists, every where,
entertained hopes of the restoration of monarchy; and
the favour, which they universally bore the army, con∣tributed
very much to discourage the parliament, and to
forward their submission.</P>
<P>THE King began to feel of what consequence he was.
The more the national confusions increased, the more
was he confident, that all parties would, at last, have
recourse to his lawful authority, as the only remedy for
the public disorders. <HI>You cannot be without me,</HI> said he,
on several occasions: <HI>You cannot compose the nation but by
<PB N="101" REF="147"/>
my assistance.</HI> A people without government and without
liberty, a parliament without authority, an army with∣out
a legal master: Distractions every where, terrors,
oppressions, convulsions: From this scene of confusion,
which could not long continue, all men, he hoped,
would be brought to reflect on that antient government,
under which they and their ancestors had so long en∣joyed
happiness and tranquillity.</P>
<P>THOUGH Charles kept his ears open to all proposals,
and expected to hold the ballance between the opposite
parties, he entertained more hopes of accommodation
with the army. He had experienced the extreme rigour
of the parliament. They pretended totally to annihilate
his authority: They had confined his person. In both
these particulars, the army showed more indulgence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 303.</NOTE>.
None of his friends were debarred his presence. And in
the proposals, which the council of officers sent for the
settlement of the nation, they insisted neither on the
abolition of episcopacy, nor on the punishment of the
royalists; the two points to which the King had the
most extreme reluctance: And they demanded that a
period should be put to the present parliament, the event
for which he most ardently longed.</P>
<P>HIS conjunction too seemed more natural with the
generals, than with that usurping assembly, who had so
long assumed the entire authority of the state, and who
had declared their resolution still to continue masters.
By gratifying a few persons with titles and preferments,
he might draw over, he hoped, the whole military
power, and, in an instant, reinstate himself in his civil
authority. To Ireton he offered the lieutenancy of Ire∣land:
To Cromwel, the garter, the title of Earl of
Essex, and the command of the army. Negotiations to
this purpose were secretly conducted. Cromwel pre∣tended
to hearken to them; and was pleased to keep the
<PB N="102" REF="148"/>
door open for an accommodation, if the course of events
should, at any time, render it necessary. And the
King, who had no suspicion, that one, born a private
gentleman, could entertain the daring ambition of seiz∣ing
a sceptre, transmitted through a long line of mon∣archs;
indulged hopes, that he would, at last, embrace
a measure, which, by all the motives of duty, interest,
and safety, seemed to be recommended to him.</P>
<P>WHILE Cromwel allured the King by these expecta∣tions,
he still continued his scheme of reducing the par∣liament
to subjection, and depriving them of all means
of resistance. To gratify the army, the parliament in∣vested
Fairfax with the title of general in chief of all the
forces in England and Ireland; and entrusted the
whole military authority to a person, who, though well
inclined to their service, was no longer at his own dis∣posal.</P>
<P>THEY voted, that the troops, which, in obedience
to them, had inlisted for Ireland, and deserted the re∣bellious
army, should be disbanded, or, in other words,
be punished for their fidelity. The forces in the north,
under Pointz, had already mutined against their gene∣ral,
and had entered into an association with that body
of the army, which was so successfully employed in ex∣alting
the military above the civil authority<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 620.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT no resource might remain to the parliament,
it was demanded, that the militia of London should be
changed, the presbyterian commissioners displaced, and
the command restored to those, who, during the course
of the war, had constantly exercised it. The parliament
even complied with so violent a demand, and passed a
vote in obedience to the army<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 629. 632.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this unlimited patience, they proposed to tempo∣rize
under their present difficulties, and they hoped to
<PB N="103" REF="149"/>
find a more favourable opportunity for recovering their
authority and influence: But the impatience of the city
lost them all the advantage of their cautious measures.
A petition against the alteration of the militia was car∣ried<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of July.</NOTE>
to Westminster, attended by the apprentices and se∣ditious
multitude, who besieged the door of the com∣mons;
and by their clamour, noise, and violence,
obliged them to reverse that vote, which they had passed
so lately. When gratified in this pretension, they im∣mediately
dispersed, and left the parliament at liberty<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 641, 643. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 61. Whitlocke, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 269. Cl. Walker, p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO sooner was intelligence of this tumult conveyed
to Reading, than the army were put in motion. The
two houses being under restraint, they were resolved,
they said, to vindicate, against the seditious citizens,
the invaded privileges of parliament, and restore that as∣sembly
to its just freedom of debate and council. In
their way to London, they were drawn up on Houn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low-Heath;
a formidable army, twenty thousand
strong, and determined, without regard to laws or li∣berty,
to pursue whatever measures their generals should
dictate to them. Here the most favourable event hap∣pened,
to quicken and encourage their advance. The
speakers of the two houses, Manchester and Lenthal,
attended with eight peers, and about sixty commoners,
having secretly retired from the city, presented themselves
with their maces, and all the ensigns of their dignity;
and complaining of the violence put upon them, applied
to the army for defence and protection. They were re∣ceived
with shouts and acclamations: Respect was paid
them as to the parliament of England: And the army
being provided of so plausible a pretence, which, in all
public transactions, is of great consequence, advanced
to chastise the rebellious city, and to re-instate the vio∣lated
parliament<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 750. Claren∣don, vol. v. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="150"/>
NEITHER Lenthal nor Manchester were esteemed in∣dependents;
and such a step in them was intirely unex∣pecked.
But they probably foresaw, that the army must,
in the end, prevail, and they were willing to pay court
in time to that authority, which began to predominate in
the nation.</P>
<P>THE parliament, forced from their temporizing mea∣sures,
and obliged to resign, at once, or combat for their
liberty and power, prepared themselves with vigour for
defence, and determined to resist the violence of the ar∣my.
The two houses immediately chose new speakers,
Lord Hunsdon, and Henry Pelham: They renewed their
former orders for inlisting troops: They appointed Mas∣sey
to be commander: They ordered the trained bands
to mann the lines: And the whole city was in a ferment,
and resounded with military preparations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vii. p. 646.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN any intelligence arrived, that the army stopped
or retreated, the shout of <HI>One and all,</HI> ran with alacrity,
from street to street, among the citizens: When news
came of their advancing, the cry of <HI>Treat and capitulate</HI>
was no less loud and vehement<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 265.</NOTE>. The terror of an uni∣versal
pillage, and even massacre, had seized the timid
inhabitants.</P>
<P>AS the army approached, Rainsborow, being sent by
the general over the river, presented himself before South-wark,
and was gladly received by some soldiers, who were
quartered there for its defence, and who were resolved
not to separate their interests from those of the army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Aug.</NOTE>
It behoved then the parliament to submit. The army
marched in triumph through the city; but preserved the
greatest order, decency, and appearance of humility.
They conducted to Westminster the two speakers, who
took their seats as if nothing had happened. The eleven
impeached members, being accused as causes of the tu∣mult,
were expelled; and most of them retired beyond
<PB N="105" REF="151"/>
sea: Seven peers were impeached: The mayor, one she∣riff,
and three aldermen, sent to the Tower: Several ci∣tizens
and officers of the militia, committed to prison:
Every deed of the parliament annulled, from the day of
the tumult till the return of the speakers: The lines
about the city levelled: The militia restored to the in∣dependents:
Regiments quartered in Whitehall and the
Meuse: And the parliament being reduced to a regular
formed servitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The army subdue the parliament.</NOTE> a day was appointed of solemn thanks∣giving
to God for the restoration of its liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 797, 798, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE independent party exulted in their victory. The
whole authority of the nation, they imagined, was lodged
in their hands; and they had a near prospect of mould∣ing
the government into that imaginary republic, which
had long been the object of their wishes. They had se∣cretly
concurred in all encroachments of the military
power; and they expected, by the terror of the sword,
to impose a more perfect system of liberty on the reluctant
nation. All parties, the king, the church, the parlia∣ment,
the presbyterians, had been guilty of errors, since
the commencement of these disorders: But it must be
confessed, that this delusion of the independents and re∣publicans
was, of all others, the most contrary to com∣mon
sense and the established maxims of policy. Yet
were the leaders of that party, Vane, Fiennes, St. John,
Martin, the men in England the most celebrated for pro∣found
thought and deep contrivance; and by their well-coloured
pretences and professions, they had over-reached
the whole nation. To deceive such men would argue a
superlative capacity in Cromwel; were it not, that, be∣sides
the great difference there is between dark, crooked
councils and true wisdom, an exorbitant passion for rule
and authority will make the most prudent overlook the
dangerous consequences of such measures as seem to tend,
in any degree, to their own advancement.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="152"/>
THE leaders of the army, having established their do∣minion
over the parliament and city, ventured to bring
the King to Hampton-Court; and he lived, for some
time, in that palace, with an appearance of dignity and
freedom. Such admirable equability of temper did he
possess, that, during all the variety of fortune, which he
underwent, no difference was perceived in his counte∣nance
or behaviour; and tho' a prisoner, in the hands of
his most inveterate enemies, he supported, towards all
who approached him, the majesty of a monarch; and
that, neither with less nor greater state, than what he
had been accustomed to maintain. His manner, which
was not in itself popular nor gracious, now appeared
amiable, from its great meekness and equality.</P>
<P>THE parliament renewed their applications to him,
and presented him with the same conditions, which they
had offered at Newcastle. The king declined accepting
them, and desired the parliament to take the proposals of
the army into consideration, and make them the founda∣tion
of the public settlement<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 810.</NOTE>. He still entertained
hopes, that his negotiations with the generals would be
crowned with success; tho' every thing, in that parti∣cular,
bore daily a worse aspect. Most historians have
thought, that Cromwel never was sincere in his profes∣sions;
and that, having, by force, rendered himself
master of the King's person, and, by fair pretences, ac∣quired
the countenance of the royalists, he had employed
these advantages to the enslaving the parliament: And
afterwards thought of nothing but the establishment of
his own unlimited authority, with which he esteemed
the restoration, and even life of the King, altogether in∣compatible.
This opinion, so much warranted by the
exorbitant ambition and profound dissimulation of his
character, meets with ready belief; tho' 'tis more agree∣able
to the narrowness of human views, and the darkness
<PB N="107" REF="153"/>
of futurity, to suppose, that this daring usurper was
guided by events, and did not, as yet, foresee, with any
assurance, that unparalleled greatness, which he after∣wards
attained. Many writers of that age have asserted<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Salmonet, Ludlow, Hollis, &amp;c. all these, especially the last, being the declared inveterate enemies of Cromwel, are the more to be credited, when they advance any fact, which may serve to apologize for his violent and cri∣minal conduct. There prevails a story, that Cromwel intercepted a letter, wrote to the Queen, where the King said, that he would first raise and then destroy Cromwel. But, besides that this conduct seems to contradict the character of the King, it is, on other accounts, totally unworthy of credit. It is first told by Roger Coke, a very passionate and foolish historian, who wrote too so late as the revolution, and who mentions it only as a rumour. In the Memoirs of Lord Broghill, we meet with another story of an intercepted letter, which deserves some more attention, and agrees very well with the nar∣ration here given. It is thus related by Mr. Maurice, chaplain to Roger, Earl of Orrery. “Lord Orrery, in the time of his greatness with Cromwel, just after he had so seasonably relieved him in his great distress at Clonmell, riding out of Youghall one day with him and Ireton, they fell into discourse about the King's death. Cromwel thereupon said more than once, that if the King had followed his own judgment, and had been attended by none but trusty servants, he had fooled them all; and that once they had a mind to have closed with him, but, upon something that happened, fell off from that design. Orrery finding them in good humour, and be∣ing alone with them, asked, if he might presume to desire to know, why they would once have closed with his Majesty, and why they did not. Cromwel very freely told him, he would satisfy him in both his queries. The reason (says he) why we would have closed with the King was this: We found that the Scotch and presbyterians began to be more powerful than we, and were likely to agree with him, and leave us in the lurch. For this reason we thought it best to prevent them, by offering first to come in upon reasonable conditions: But whilst our thoughts were taken up with this subject, there came a letter to us from one of our spies, who was of the King's bed-chamber, acquainting us, that our final doom was decreed that very day; that he could not possibly learn what it was, but we might discover it, if we could but intercept a letter sent from the King to the Queen, wherein he informed her of his resolution; that this letter was sowen up in the skirt of a saddle, and the bearer of it would come with the saddle upon his head, about ten of the clock that night, to the Blue Boar in Holbourn, where he was to take horse for Dover. The messenger knew nothing of the letter in the saddle, tho' some in Dover did. We were at Windsor (said Cromwel) when we received this letter, and imme∣diately upon the receipt of it, Ireton and I resolved to take one trusty fellow with us, and to go in troopers habits to that inn. We did so; and leav∣ing our man at the gate of the inn, (which had a wicket only open to let persons in and out) to watch and give us notice when any man came in with a saddle, we went into a drinking-stall. We there continued, drinking cans of beer, till about ten of the clock, when our centinel at the gate gave us notice, that the man with the saddle was come. We rose up presently, and just as the man was leading out his horse saddled, we came up to him with drawn swords, and told him, we were to search all that went in and out there; but as he looked like an honest man, we would only search his saddle, and so dismiss him. The saddle was ungirt; we carried it into the stall, where we had been drinking, and ripping open one of the skirts, we there found the letter we wanted. Having thus got it into our hands, we delivered the man (whom we had left with our centinel) his saddle, told him he was an honest fellow, and bid him go about his business; which he did, pursuing his journey without more ado, and ignorant of the harm he had suffered. We found in the letter, that his Majesty acquainted the Queen, that he was courted by both factions, the Scots presbyterians and the army; and that those which bade the fairest for him should have him: but yet he thought he should close with the Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch sooner than with the other. Upon this we returned to Windsor; and finding we were not like to have good terms from the King, we from that time vowed his destruc∣tion.” “This relation suiting well enough with other passages and circum∣stances at this time, I have inserted to gratify the reader's curiosity.” Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 12.</NOTE>,
<PB N="108" REF="154"/>
that he really intended to make a private bargain with
the King; a measure, which carried the most plausible
appearance both for his safety and advancement: But
that he found insuperable difficulties in reconciling to it
the wild humours of the army. The horror and antipa∣thy
of these fanatics had, for many years, been artfully
fomented against Charles; and tho' their principles were,
on all occasions, easily warped and eluded by private in∣terest,
yet was some colouring requisite, and a flat con∣tradiction
to all former professions and tenets could not
safely be proposed to them. 'Tis certain, at least, that
Cromwel made use of this reason, why he admitted rarely
of visits from the King's friends, and showed less favour
than formerly to the royal cause. The agitators, he said,
had rendered him odious to the army, and had repre∣sented
him as a traitor, who, for the sake of private in∣terest,
<PB N="109" REF="155"/>
was ready to betray the cause of God to the great
enemy of piety and religion. Desperate projects too, he
asserted to be secretly formed, for the murder of the
King; and he pretended much to dread lest all his autho∣rity,
and that of the commanding officers, would not be able
to restrain these enthusists from their bloody purposes<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v p. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INTELLIGENCE being daily brought to the King of
menaces thrown out by the agitators; he began to think
of retiring from Hampton-Court, and of putting him∣self
in some place of safety. The guards were doubled
upon him: The promiscuous concourse of people re∣strained:
A more jealous care exerted in attending his
person: All, under colour of protecting him from dan∣ger;
but really with a view of making him uneasy in
his present situation. These artifices soon operated the
intended effect. Charles, who was naturally apt to be
swayed by council, and who had not then access to
any good council, took suddenly a resolution of with∣drawing
himself, tho' without any concerted, at least,
any rational scheme, for the future disposal of his per∣son.
Attended only by Sir John Berkeley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Nov.</NOTE> Ashburn∣ham,
and Leg, he privately left Hampton-Court; and
his escape was not discovered, till near an hour after;
when those who entered his chamber, found on the table
some letters directed to the parliament, to the general, and
to the officer, who had attended him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 871.</NOTE>. All night, he tra∣velled
thro' the forest, and arrived next day at Tichfield, a
seat of the Earl of Southampton, where the Countess dow∣ager
resided, a woman of great honour, to whom, the King
knew, he might safely entrust his person. Before he ar∣rived
at this place, he had gone to the sea-coast; and
expressed great anxiety, that a ship, which he seemed to
look for, had not arrived; and from thence, Berkeley
and Leg, who were not in the secret, conjectured, that
his intention was to transport himself beyond sea.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="156"/>
THE King could not hope to remain long concealed
at Tichfield: What measure should be next embraced,
was the question. In the neighbourhood lay the isle of
Wight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King flies to the isle of Wight.</NOTE> of which Hammond was governor. This man
was entirely dependent on Cromwel. At his recom∣mendation
he had married a daughter of the famous
Hambden, who, during his life-time, had b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en an inti∣mate
friend of Cromwel, and whose memory was ever
religiously respected by him. These circumstances were
very unfavourable: Yet, because the governor was ne∣phew
to Dr. Hammond, the King's favourite chaplain,
and had acquired a good character in the army, it was
thought proper to have recourse to him, in the present
exigence, when no other rational expedient could be
thought of. Ashburnham and Berkeley were dispatched
to the island. They had orders not to inform Hammond
of the place, where the King lay concealed, till they
had first obtained a promise of him not to deliver up his
Majesty, tho' the parliament and army should require
him; but to restore him to his liberty, if he could not
defend him. This promise, it is evident, would have
been a very slender security: Yet even without exacting
it, Ashburnham, imprudently, if not treacherously,
brought Hammond to Tichfield; and the King was ob∣liged
to put himself into his hands, and to attend him to
Carisbroke-castle in the isle of Wight, where, tho'
received with great demonstrations of respect and duty,
he was in reality a prisoner.</P>
<P>LORD CLARENDON<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 79, 80, &amp;c.</NOTE> is positive, that the King, when
he fled from Hampton-Court, had no intention of going
to this island: and indeed, all the circumstances of that
historian's narrative, which we have here followed,
strongly favour this opinion. But there remains a letter
of Charles to the Earl of Leneric, secretary of Scotland;
in which he plainly intimates, that that measure was
<PB N="111" REF="157"/>
voluntarily embraced, and even insinuates, that, if he
had thought proper, he might have been in Jersey or any
other place of safety<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">These are the words: “Laneric; I wonder to hear (if that be true) that some of my friends say, that my going to Jersey would much more have furthered my personal treaty, than my coming hither, for which, as I see no colour of reason, so I had not been here, if I had thought that fancy true, or had not been secured of a personal treaty; of which I nei∣ther do, nor I hope will repent: For I am daily more and more satisfied with the governor, and find these islanders very good, peaceable, and quiet people. This encouragement I have thought not unfit for you to receive, hoping at least it may do good upon others, tho' needless to you.” Bur∣net's Memoirs of Hamilton, p. 326. See also Rushworth, part 4. vol. ii. p. 941. All the writers of that age, except Clarendon, represent the King's going to the isle of Wight as voluntary and intended. Perhaps the King thought it little for his credit, to be trepanned into this measure, and was more willing to take it on himself as intirely voluntary. Perhaps, he thought it would encourage his friends, if they thought him in a situation, which was not disagreeable to him.</NOTE>. Perhaps, he still confided in the
promises of the generals; and flattered himself, that, if
he were removed from the fury of the agitators, by which
his life was immediately threatened, they would execute
what they had so often promised in his favour.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the truth in this matter; for it
is impossible fully to ascertain the truth; Charles was
never guilty of a weaker step, nor one more agreeable
to Cromwel and all his enemies. He was now lodged
in a place, removed from his partizans, at the disposal
of the army, whence it would be very difficult to deliver
him, either by force or artifice. And tho' it was always
in the power of Cromwel, whenever he pleased, to have
sent him thither; yet such a measure would have been
very invidious, if not accompanied with some danger.
That the King should voluntarily throw himself into the
snare, and at once forfeit his own reputation of pru∣dence,
and gratify his implacable persecutors, was
to them an incident peculiarly fortunate, and proved in
the issue very fatal to him.</P>

CROMWEL, being now entirely master of the parlia∣ment,
and free from all anxiety, with regard to the
King's person, applied himself seriously to quell those
disorders in the army which he himself had so artfully
raised, and so successfully employed, against both King
and parliament. In order to engage the troops into a re∣bellion
against their masters, he had encouraged a very
arrogant spirit among the inferior officers and private
men; and the camp, in many respects, carried more the
appearance of civil liberty than of military obedience.
The troops themselves were formed into a kind of re∣public;
and the plans of imaginary republics for the
settlement of the state, were, every day, the topics of
conversation among these armed legislators. Royalty it
was agreed to abolish: Nobility must be set aside: Even
all ranks of men be levelled; and an universal equality
of property, as well as power, be introduced among the
citizens. The saints, they said, were the salt of the
earth: An entire parity had place among the elect: And,
by the same rule, that the apostles were exalted from the
most ignoble professions, the meanest centinel, if en∣lightened
by the spirit, was entitled to equal regard with
the greatest commander. In order to wean the soldiers
from these licentious maxims, Cromwel had issued or∣ders
for discontinuing the meetings of the agitators; and
he pretended to pay intire obedience to the parliament▪
whom, being now reduced fully to subjection, he pro∣posed
to make, for the future, the instruments of his au<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thority.
But the <HI>Levellers,</HI> for so that party in the arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was called, having experienced the sweets of dominion
would not so easily be deprived of it. They secret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
continued their meetings: They asserted, that their of

<PB N="113" REF="161"/>
were concerted: And every thing tended to total
anarchy and confusion. But this distemper was soon
cured by the rough, but dexterous hand of Cromwel.
He chose the occasion of a review, that he might display
the greater boldness, and spread the terror the wider. He
seized the ringleaders before their companions: Held in
the field a council of war: Shot one mutineer instantly;
and struck such dread into the rest, that they presently
threw down the symbols of sedition, which they had
displayed, and thenceforth returned to their wonted dis∣cipline
and obedience<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 875. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CROMWEL had great deserence for the council of Ire∣ton;
a man, who, having grafted the soldier on the
lawyer, the statesman on the saint, had adopted such
principles as were fitted to introduce the severest tyranny,
while they seemed to encourage the most unbounded li∣cence
in human society. Fierce in his nature, tho' pro∣bably
sincere in his intentions; he proposed by arbitrary
power to establish liberty, and, in prosecution of his
imagined religious purposes, he thought himself dispensed
from all the ordinary rules of morality, by which inferior
mortals must allow themselves to be governed. From
his suggestion, Cromwel secretly called at Windsor a
council of the chief officers, in order to deliberate con∣cerning
the settlement of the nation, and the future dis∣posal
of the King's person<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 92.</NOTE>. In this conference, which
commenced with devout prayers, poured forth by Crom∣wel
himself and other inspired persons (for the officers
of this army received inspiration with their commission),
was first opened the daring and unheard of council, of
bringing the King to justice, and of punishing, by a ju∣dicial
sentence, their sovereign for his pretended tyranny
and mal-administration. While Charles lived, even tho'
restrained to the closest prison, conspiracies, they knew,
<PB N="114" REF="162"/>
and insurrections would never be wanting, in favour of
a prince, who was so extremely revered and beloved by
his own party, and whom the nation in general began
to regard with great affection and compassion. To
murder him privately was exposed to the imputation of
injustice and cruelty, aggravated by the baseness of such
a crime; and every odious epithet of <HI>Traitor</HI> and <HI>Assassin</HI>
would, by the general voice of mankind, be undisput∣ably
ascribed to the actors of such a villany. Some un∣expected
procedure must be attempted, which would
astonish the world by its novelty, would bear the sem∣blance
of justice, and would cover its barbarity by the
audaciousness of the enterprize. Striking in with the
fanatical notions of the intire equality of mankind, it
would ensure the devoted obedience of the army, and
serve as a general engagement against the royal family,
whom, by their open and united deed, they would so
heinously affront and injure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The following was a very favourite text among the enthusiasts of that age. “Let the high praises of God be in the mouths of his saints, and a twofold sword in their hands, to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishment upon the people; to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgments written: This honour have all his saints.” Psalm cxlix. ver. 6, 7, 8, 9. Hugh Pe∣ters, the mad chaplain of Cromwel, preached frequently upon this text.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS measure, therefore, being secretly resolved on, it was
requisite, by degrees, to make the parliament adopt it, and to
conduct them from violence to violence; till this last act of
atrocious iniquity should seem, in a manner, wholly inevit∣able.
The King, in order to remove those fears and jea∣lousies,
which were perpetually pleaded as reasons for every
invasion of the constitution, had offered, by a message,
sent from Carisbroke-castle, to resign, during his own
life, the power of the militia and the nomination to all
the great offices; provided, that, after his death, these
prerogatives should again revert to the crown<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 880.</NOTE>: But the
<PB N="115" REF="163"/>
parliament acted intirely as victors and enemies; and, in
all their transactions with him, payed no longer any re∣gard
to equity or reason. At the instigation of the in∣dependents
and army, they neglected this offer, and
framed four propositions, which they sent him as preli∣minaries;
and, before they would deign to treat, they
demanded his positive assent to all of them. By one, he
was required to invest the parliament with the military
power for twenty years, together with an authority to
levy whatever money should be necessary for exercising
it: And even after the twenty years should be elapsed,
they reserved a right of reassuming the same authority,
whenever they should declare the safety of the kingdom
to require it. By the second, he must recall all his pro∣clamations
and declarations against the parliament, and
acknowlege that assembly to have taken arms for their
just and necessary defence. By the third, he was to an∣null
all the acts, and void all the patents of peerage,
which had passed the great seal, since it had been carried
from London by Lord-Keeper Littleton. By the fourth,
he gave the two houses power to adjourn as they thought
fit: A demand seemingly of no great consequence; but
contrived by the independents, that they might be able
to remove the parliament to places, where it should re∣main
in perpetual subjection to the army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 88.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King regarded the pretension as most unusual<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648.</NOTE>
and exorbitant, that he should make such concessions,
while insecure of any settlement; and should blindly
trust his enemies for the conditions, which they were
afterwards to grant him. He required, therefore, a per∣sonal
treaty with the parliament, and desired that all the
terms, on both sides, should be adjusted, before any
concessions, on either side, should be insisted on. The
republican party in the house pretended to take fire at
<PB N="116" REF="164"/>
this answer; and openly inveighed, in the most virulent
terms, against the person and government of the King;
whose name, hitherto, had commonly, in all debates,
been mentioned with some degree of reverence. Ireton,
seeming to speak the sense of the army, under the appel∣lation
of many thousand godly men, who had ventured
their lives in defence of the parliament, said, That the
King, by denying the four bills, had refused safety and
protection to his people; that their obedience to him
was but a reciprocal duty for his protection of them;
and that, as he had failed on his part, they were freed
from all obligations to allegiance, and must settle the
nation, without consulting any longer so misguided a
prince<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cl. Walker, p. 70.</NOTE>. Cromwel, after giving an ample character of
the valour, good affections, and godliness of the army,
subjoined, That it was expected the parliament should
govern and defend the kingdom by their own power and
resolutions, and not accustom the people any longer to
expect safety and government from an obstinate man,
whose heart God had hardened; that those, who, at the
expence of their blood, had hitherto defended the par∣liament
from so many dangers, would still continue,
with fidelity and courage to protect them against all op∣position,
in this vigorous measure. “Teach them not,”
added he, “by your neglecting your own safety and
that of the kingdom (in which theirs too is involved)
to imagine themselves betrayed, and their interest
abandoned to the rage and malice of an irreconcilable
enemy, whom, for your sake, they have dared to
provoke. Beware, (<HI>and at these words he laid his hand
on his sword</HI>) beware, lest de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pair cause them to seek
safety by some other means, than by adhering to you▪
who know not how to consult your own safety<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 70.</NOTE>.”
Such arguments prevailed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of Jan.</NOTE> though ninety-one members
had still the courage to oppose. It was voted, that no more
<PB N="117" REF="165"/>
addresses be made to the King, nor any letters or mes∣sages
be received from him; and that it be treason for
any one, without leave of the two houses, to have any
intercourse with him. The Lords concurred in the
same ordinance<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 965. 967.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this vote of non-addresses, for so it was called, the
King was, in reality, dethroned, and the whole consti∣tution
formally overthrown. So violent a measure was
supported by a declaration no less violent. The blackest
calumnies were there thrown upon the King; such as,
even in their famous remonstrance, the commons thought
proper to omit, as incredible and extravagant: The
poisoning his father, the betraying Rochelle, the con∣triving
the Irish massacre<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 998. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 93.</NOTE>. By blasting his same, had
that injury been in their power, they formed a very pro∣per
prelude to the murthering of his person.</P>
<P>NO sooner had the King refused his assent to the four
bills, than Hammond, by orders from the army, remov∣ed
all his servants, cut off all his correspondence with
his friends, and shut him up in close confinement. The
King afterwards showed to Sir Philip Warwick, a decre∣pid
old man, who, he said, was employed to kindle his
fire, and was the best company he enjoyed, during seve∣ral
months that this rigorous confinement lasted<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Warwick, 329.</NOTE>. No
amusement was allowed him, or society, which might
relieve his anxious thoughts: To be speedily poisoned
or assassinated was the only prospect, which he had, every
moment, before his eyes: For he entertained no appre∣hension
of a judicial sentence and execution, an event,
of which no history hitherto furnished an example.
Meanwhile the parliament were very industrious in pub∣lishing,
from time to time, the intelligence, which they
received from Hammond; how chearful the King was,
how pleased with every one who approached him, how

satisfied in his present condition<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 989.</NOTE>. As if the view of
such benignity and constancy had not been more proper
to inflame, than allay, the general compassion of the
people. The great source, whence the King derived
consolation amidst all his calamities, was undoubtedly
religion; a principle, which, in him, seems to have
contained nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierce nor gloomy, nothing which en∣raged
him against his adversaries, or terrified him with
the dismal prospect of futurity. While every thing
around him bore a hostile aspect; while friends, family,
relations, whom he passionately loved, were placed at a
distance, and unable to serve him; he reposed himself
with confidence in the arms of that Being, who pene∣trates
and sustains all nature, and whose severities, if re∣ceived
with piety and resignation, he regarded as the
surest pledge of unexhausted favour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second civil war.</NOTE> THE parliament and army, meanwhile, enjoyed not,
in tranquillity, that power, which they had obtained
with so much violence and injustice. Combinations and
conspiracies, they were sensible, were every where form∣ing
around them; and Scotland, whence the King's
cause had received the first fatal blow, seemed now to
promise it support and assistance.</P>
<P>BEFORE the delivery of the King's person at New-castle,
and much more, since that event, the subjects of
discontent had been daily multiplying between the two
kingdoms. The independents, who began to prevail,
took all occasions of mortifying the Scots, whom the
presbyterians looked on with the greatest affection and
veneration. When the Scots commissioners, who, join∣ed
to a committee of English lords and commons, had
managed the war, were ready to depart, it was proposed
in parliament to give them thanks for their civilities and
good offices. The independents prevailed, that the
words, <HI>Good offices,</HI> should be struck out; and thus the
<PB N="119" REF="169"/>
whole brotherly friendship and intimate alliance with
the Scots, resolved itself into an acknowlegement of
their being well-bred gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE advance of the army to London, the subjection
of the parliament, the seizing of the King at Holmby,
his confinement in Carisbroke castle, were so many
blows, sensibly felt by that nation; as threatening the
final overthrow of presbytery, to which they were so
passionately devoted. The covenant was profanely call∣ed,
in the house of commons, an almanack out of
date<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cl. Walker, p. 80.</NOTE>; and that impiety, though complained of, had
passed uncensured. Instead of being able to determine
and establish orthodoxy by the sword and by penal sta∣tutes,
they saw the sectarian army, who were absolute
masters, claim an unbounded liberty of conscience,
which the presbyterians regarded with the utmost hor∣ror.
All the violences, put on the King, they loudly
blamed, as repugnant to the covenant, by which they
stood engaged to defend his royal person. And those
very actions, of which they themselves had been guilty,
they denominated treason and rebellion, when executed
by an opposite party.</P>
<P>THE Earls of Loudon, Lauderdale, and Laneric, who
were sent to London, protested against the four proposi∣tions;
as containing too great a diminution of the
King's civil power, and providing no security for reli∣gion.
They complained, that, notwithstanding this
protestation, the propositions were still insisted on; con∣trary
to the solemn league, and to the treaty between
the two nations. And when they accompanied the Eng∣lish
commissioners to the isle of Wight, they secretly
formed a treaty with the King, for arming Scotland in
his favour<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vol. v. p. 101.</NOTE>.</P>

THREE parties, at that time, prevailed in Scotland.
The <HI>Royalists,</HI> who insisted upon the restoration of the
King's authority, without any regard to religious sects
or tenets. Of these Montrose, though absent, was re∣garded
as the head.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion from Scot∣land.</NOTE> The <HI>Rigid presbyterians,</HI> who hated
the King, even more than they abhorred toleration;
and who determined to give him no assistance, till he
should sign the covenant: These were governed by
Argyle. The <HI>Moderate presbyterians,</HI> who endeavoured
to reconcile the interests of religion and of the crown,
and hoped, by supporting the presbyterian party in Eng∣land,
to suppress the sectarian army, and to re-instate
the parliament, as well as King, in their just freedom
and authority: The two brothers, Hamilton and Lane∣ric,
were leaders of this party.</P>
<P>WHEN Pendennis castle was surrendered to the parlia∣mentary
army, Hamilton, who then obtained his liberty,
returned into Scotland; and being generously determined
to remember antient favours, more than recent injuries,
he immediately embraced, with zeal and success, the
protection of the royal cause. He obtained a vote
from the parliament to arm 40,000 men in support of
the King's authority, and to call over a considerable
body under Monro, who commanded the Scots forces in
Ulster. And though he openly protested, that the co∣venant
was the foundation of all his measures, he secret∣ly
formed an alliance with the English royalists, Sir
Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip Musgrave, who
surprized Berwic and Carlis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c, and levied considerable
forces in the north of England.</P>
<P>THE general assembly, who sat at the same time, and
were guided by Argyle, dreaded the consequence of
these measures, and foresaw, that the opposite party, if
successful, would effect the restoration of monarchy,
without the establishment of presbytery in England. To
join the King before he had subscribed the covenant,
<PB N="121" REF="173"/>
was, in their eyes, to restore him to his honour before
Christ was restored to his<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 305.</NOTE>; and they thundered out
anathemas against every one, who payed obedience to
the parliament. Two supreme independent judicatories
were erected in the kingdom; one threatening the people
with damnation and eternal torments, the other with
imprisonment, banishment, and military execution. The
people were distracted in their choice; and the arma∣ment
of Hamilton's party, though seconded by all the
civil power, went on but slowly. The royalists he
would not, as yet, allow to join him, lest he might
give offence to the ecclesiastical party; though he se∣cretly
promised them trust and preferment, so soon as
his army should advance into England.</P>
<P>WHILE the Scots were making preparations for the
invasion of England, every part of that kingdom was
agitated with tumults, insurrections, conspiracies, dis∣contents.
'Tis seldom, that the people gain any thing
by revolutions in government; because the new settle∣ment,
jealous and insecure, must commonly be support∣ed
with more expence and severity than the old: But
on no occasion was the truth of this maxim more sensibly
felt, than in the present situation of England. Com∣plaints
against the oppression of ship-money, against the
tyranny of the star-chamber, had rouzed the people to
arms: And having gained a compleat victory over the
crown, they found themselves loaded with a multiplicity
of taxes, formerly unknown; and scarce an appearance
of law and liberty remained in the administration. The
presbyterians, who had chiefly supported the war, were
enraged to find the prize, just when it seemed within
their reach, snatched by violence from them. The roy∣alists,
disappointed in their expectations, by the cruel
treatment which the King received from the army, were
strongly animated to restore him to liberty, and to recover
<PB N="122" REF="174"/>
the advantages which they had unfortunately lost. All
orders of men were inflamed with indignation at seeing
the military prevail over the civil power, and King and
parliament at once reduced to subjection by a mercenary
army. Many persons of family and distinction, from
the beginning of the war, had adhered to the parliament:
But all those were, by the new party, deprived of au∣thority;
and every office was entrusted to the most ig∣noble
part of the nation. A base populace exalted above
their superiors: Hypocrites exercising iniquity under the
vizor of religion: These two circumstances promised not
much liberty or lenity to the people; and these were
now found united, in the same usurped and illegal admi∣nistration.</P>
<P>THOUGH the whole nation seemed to combine in their
hatred of military tyranny, the ends, which the several
parties proposed, were so different, that little concert
was observed in their insurrections. Langhorne, Poyer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Powel, presbyterian officers, who commanded bo∣dies
of troops in Wales, were the first who declared
themselves, and drew together a considerable army in
those parts, which were extremely devoted to the royal
cause. An insurrection was raised in Kent by young
Hales and the Earl of Norwich. Lord Capel, Sir
Charles Lucas, Sir George Lisle, excited commotions
in Essex. The Earl of Holland, who had several times
changed party, since the commencement of the civil
wars, endeavoured to assemble forces in Surrey. Pom∣fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
castle in Yorkshire was surprized by Morrice. Lang∣dale
and Musgrave were in arms, and masters of Berw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and Carlisle in the north.</P>
<P>WHAT seemed the most dangerous circumstance, the
general spirit of discontent had seized the fleet. Seven∣teen
ships, lying in the mouth of the river, declared for
the King; and putting Rainsborow, their admiral,
<PB N="123" REF="175"/>
ashore, sailed over to Holland, where the Prince of
Wales took the command of them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English royalists exclaimed loudly against Ha∣milton's
delays, which they attributed to a refined po∣licy
in the Scots; as if their intentions were, that all
the King's party should first be suppressed, and the vic∣tory
remain intire to the presbyterians. Hamilton, with
better reason, complained of the precipitate humour of
the English royalists, who, by their ill-timed insurrec∣tions,
forced him to march his army, before his levies
were compleated, or his preparations in any forwardness.</P>
<P>NO commotions, beyond a tumult of the apprentices,
which was soon suppressed, were raised in London: The
terror of the army kept the citizens in subjection. The
parliament was so over-awed, that they declared the Scots
to be enemies, and all who joined them, traitors.
Ninety members, however, of the lower house had the
courage to dissent from this vote.</P>
<P>CROMWEL and the military council prepared them∣selves
with vigour and conduct for defence. The esta∣blishment
of the army was, at this time, 26,000 men;
but by inlisting supernumeraries; the regiments were
greatly augmented, and commonly consisted of more
than double their stated complement<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 284.</NOTE>. Colonel Horton
first attacked the revolted troops in Wales, and gave
them a considerable defeat. The remnants of the van∣quished
threw themselves into Pembroke, and were there
closely besieged, and soon after taken, by Cromwel.
Lambert was opposed to Langdale and Musgrave in the
north, and gained advantages over them. Sir Michael
Livesey defeated the Earl of Holland at Kingston, and
pursuing his victory, took him prisoner at St. Neots.
Fairfax, having routed the Kentish royalists at Maid∣stone,
followed the broken army: And when they join∣ed
<PB N="124" REF="176"/>
the Essex insurgents, and threw themselves into Col¦chester;
he laid siege to that place, which defended it∣self
to the last extremity. A new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet was manned,
and sent out under the command of Warwic, to oppose
the revolted ships, of which the Prince had taken the
command.</P>
<P>WHILE the forces were employed in all quarters, the
parliament regained its liberty, and began to act with its
wonted courage and spirit. The members, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
withdrawn from the terror of the army, returned; and
in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>using boldness into their companions, restored to the
presbyterian party the ascendant, which it had formerly
lost. The eleven impeached members were recalled<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and the vote, by which they were expelled, was reversed.
The vote too of non-addresses was replealed; and com∣missioners,
five peers and ten commoners, were sent to
Newport in the isle of Wight, in order to treat with
the King<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 180. Sir Edward Walker's perfect Copies, p. 6.</NOTE>. He was allowed to summon several of his
friends, and old counsellors, that he might have their ad∣vice
in this important transaction<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. P. 8.</NOTE>. The theologians on
both sides, armed with their syllogisms and citations, at∣tended
as auxiliaries<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 8. 38.</NOTE>. By them, the flame had first
been raised; and their appearance was but a bad prog∣nostic
of its extinction. Any other instruments seemed
better adapted for a treaty of pacification.</P>
<P>WHEN the King presented himself to this company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Sept. Treaty of Newport.</NOTE>
a great and sensible alteration was remarked in his aspect
from what it appeared the year before, when he resided
at Hampton Court: The moment his servants had been
removed, he had laid aside all care of his person, and
had allowed his beard and hair to grow, and to hang
dishevelled and neglected. His hair was become almost
intirely gray; either from the decline of years, or from
that load of sorrows, under which he laboured, and
<PB N="125" REF="177"/>
which, though borne with constancy, preyed inwardly
on his sensible and tender mind. His friends beheld with
compassion, and perhaps even his enemies, that <HI>Grey
and discrowned head;</HI> as he himself terms it, in a copy of
verses, which the truth of the sentiment, rather than
any elegance of expression, renders very pathetic<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs of Hamilton.</NOTE>.
Having in vain endeavoured by courage to defend his
throne from his armed adversaries, it now behoved him,
by reason and persuasion, to save some fragments of it
from these peaceful, and no less implacable negotiators.</P>
<P>THE vigour of the King's mind, notwithstanding the
seeming decline of his body, here appeared unbroken
and undecayed. The parliamentary commissioners would
allow none of his council to be present, and refused to
enter into reasoning with any but himself. He alone,
during the transactions of two months, was obliged to
sustain the argument against fifteen men of the greatest
parts and capacity in both houses; and no advantage was
ever obtained over him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Memoirs, p. 72.</NOTE>. This was the scene, above
all others, in which he was qualified to excel. A quick
conception, a cultivated understanding, a chaste elocu∣tion,
a dignified manner; by these accomplishments he
triumphed in all discussions of cool and temperate rea∣soning.
<HI>The King is much changed,</HI> said the Earl of Salisbury
to Sir Philip Warwick: <HI>He is extremely improved of late.
No,</HI> replied Sir Philip; <HI>he was always so: But you are
now at last sensible of it</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 324.</NOTE>. Sir Henry Vane, discoursing
with his fellow-commissioners, drew an argument from
the King's uncommon abilities, why the terms of pa∣cification
must be rendered more strict and rigid<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Clarendon. Sir Edward Walker, p. 319.</NOTE>. But
Charles's capacity shone not equally in action as in rea∣soning.</P>
<P>THE first point insisted on by the parliamentary
commissioners, was the King's recalling all his procla∣mations
<PB N="126" REF="178"/>
and declarations against the parliament, and the
acknowledging, that they had taken arms in their own
defence. He frankly offered the former concession; but
long scrupled the latter. The falshood, as well as in∣dignity
of that acknowledgment, begot in his breast an
extreme reluctance against it. The King had, no
doubt, in some particulars of moment, invaded, from<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seeming necessity, the privileges of his people: But hav∣ing
renounced all claim to these usurped powers, having
confessed his errors, and having repaired every breach in
the constitution, and even erected new ramparts, in or∣der
to secure it; he could no longer, at the commence∣ment
of the war, be represented as the aggressor. How∣ever
it might be pretended, that the former display of his
arbitrary inclinations, or rather his monarchical prin∣ciples,
rendered an offensive or preventive war in the
parliament prudent and reasonable; it could never, in
any propriety of speech, make it be denominated a de∣fensive
one. But the parliament, sensible, that the let∣ter
of the law condemned them as rebels and traitors;
deemed this point absolutely necessary for their future
security: And the King, finding, that peace could be
obtained on no other terms, at last yielded to it. He
only entered a protest, which was admitted; that no
concession, made by him, should be valid, unless the
whole treaty of pacification was concluded<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 11, 12. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE agreed, that the parliament should retain, during
the term of twenty years, the power of the militia and
army, and of levying what money they pleased for their
support. He even yielded to them the right of resum∣ing,
at any time afterwards, this authority, whenever
they should declare such a resumption requisite for pub∣lic
safety. In effect, the important power of the sword
was for ever ravished from him and his successors<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="179"/>
HE agreed, that all the great offices, during twenty
years, should be filled by both houses of parliament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 78.</NOTE>.
He relinquished to them the entire government of Ire∣land,
and the conduct of the war there<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 45.</NOTE>. He renoun∣ced
the power of the wards, and accepted of 100,000
pounds a year in lieu of it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 69. 77.</NOTE>. He acknowledged the va∣lidity
of their great seal, and gave up his own<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 56. 68.</NOTE>. He
abandoned the power of creating peers without consent
of parliament. And he agreed, that all the debts, con∣tracted
in order to support the war against him, should
be paid by the people.</P>
<P>SO great were the alterations, made on the English
constitution by this treaty, that the King said, not with∣out
reason, that he had been more an enemy to his peo∣ple
by these concessions, could he have prevented them,
than by any other action of his life.</P>
<P>OF all the demands of the parliament, Charles re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us∣ed
only two. Though he relinquished almost every
power of the crown, he would neither give up his friends
to punishment, nor desert what he esteemed his religi∣ous
duty. The severe repentance, which he had under∣gone,
for abandoning Strafford, had, no doubt, con∣firmed
him in the resolution never again to be guilty of
a like error. His long solitude and severe afflictions had
contributed extremely to rivet him the more in those re∣ligious
principles, which had ever a considerable influ∣ence
over him. His desire, however, of finishing an
accommodation induced him to go as far in both these
particulars, as he thought any way consistent with his
duty.</P>
<P>THE estates of the royalists being, at that time, al∣most
intirely under sequestration, Charles, who could
give them no protection, consented, that they should
<PB N="128" REF="180"/>
pay such compositions, as they and the parliament could
agree on; and only begged, that they might be made
as moderate as possible. He had not the disposal of of∣fices;
and it seemed but a small sacrifice to consent,
that a certain number of his friends should be rendered
incapable of public employments<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 61.</NOTE>. But when the par∣liament
demanded a bill of attainder and banishment
against seven persons, the Marquess of Newcastle, Lord
Digby, Lord Biron, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, Sir Ri∣chard
Granville, Sir Francis Doddington, and judge
Jenkins, the King utterly refused compliance: Their
banishment for a limited time he was willing to agree
to<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 91. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RELIGION was the fatal point about which the diffe∣rences
had first arisen; and of all others, was the least
susceptible of composition or moderation between the
contending parties. The parliament insisted on the esta∣blishment
of presbytery, the sale of the chapter lands,
the abolition of all forms of prayer, and strict laws
against the catholics. The King offered to retrench
every thing, which he did not esteem of apostolical in∣stitution:
He was willing to abolish archbishops, deans,
prebends, canons: He offered, that the chapter lands
should be let at low leases during ninety-nine years;
He consented, that the present church government should
continue during three years<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. 35. 49.</NOTE>: After that time, he re∣quired
not, that any thing should be restored to bishops
but the power of ordination, and even that power to be
exercised by advice of the presbyters<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 65.</NOTE>. If the parlia∣ment,
upon the expiration of that period, was not
willing, all other branches of episcopal jurisdiction were
abolished, and a new form of church government must,
by common consent, be established. The book of com∣mon
<PB N="129" REF="181"/>
prayer he was willing to renounce, but required
the liberty of using some other liturgy in his own cha∣pel<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 75, 82. Rush. vol. viii. p. 1323.</NOTE>. A demand, which, though seemingly very rea∣sonable,
was positively refused by the parliament.</P>
<P>IN the dispute on these articles, one is not surprised,
that two of the parliamentary theologians should tell the
King, <HI>That if he did not consent to the utter abolition of epis∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pacy, he would be damned.</HI> But it is not without some
indignation, that we read the following vote of the
lords and commons. “The houses, out of their detes∣tation
to that abominable idolatry used in the mass, do
declare, that they cannot admit of, or consent unto any
such indulgence in any law, as is desired by his Ma∣jesty
for exempting the Queen and her family from
the penalties to be enacted against the exercise of the
mass<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 71.</NOTE>.” The treaty of marriage, the regard to the
Queen's sex and high station, even common humanity;
all considerations were undervalued, in comparison of
their bigotted prejudices<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The King composed a letter to the Prince, in which he related the whole course of this transaction, and accompanied his narrative with several wise, as well as pathetical reflections and advices. The words with which he con∣cluded the letter, are remarkable. “By what hath been said, you see how long I have laboured in the search of peace: Do not yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be disheartened to tread in the same steps. Use all worthy means to restore yourself to your rights, but prefer the way of peace: Show the greatness of your mind, rather to conquer your enemies by pardoning, than by punishing. If you saw how unmanly and unchristian the implacable disposition is in our ill∣wishers, you would avoid that spirit. Censure me not for having parted with so much of our right: The price was great; but the commodity was, security to us, peace to my people. And I am confident, that an∣other parliament would remember, how useful a king's power is to a peo∣ple's liberty; of how much power I divested myself, that I and they might meet once again in a parliamentary way, in order to agree the bounds of prince and people. Give belief to my experience, never to af∣fect more greatness or prerogative, than what is really and intrinsically for the good of the subjects, not the satisfaction of favourites. If you thus use it, you will never want means to be a father to all, and a bountiful prince to any, whom you incline to be extraordinarily gracious to. You may per∣ceive, that all men entrust their treasure, where it returns them interest; and if a prince, like the sea, receive and repay all the fresh streams, which the rivers entrust with him, they will not grudge, but pride themselves, to make him up an ocean. These considerations, may make you as great a prince as your father is a low one; and your state may be so much the more established, as mine hath been shaken. For our subjects have learned, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dare say, that victories over their princes, are but triumphs over themselves, and so, will more unwillingly hearken to changes hereafter. The English nation are a sober people, however, at present, infatuated. I know not but this may be the last time, I may speak to you or the world publickly. I am sensible into what hands I am fallen; and yet, I bless God, I have those inward refreshments, which the malice of my enemies cannot perturb. I have learned to busy myself, by retiring into myself; and therefore can the better digest whatever befals me; not doubting, but God's providence will restrain our enemies power, and turn their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierceness into his praise. To conclude, if God give you success, use it humbly, and be ever far from re∣venge. If he restore you to your right on hard conditions, whatever you promise, keep. These men, who have violated laws, which they were bound to preserve, will find their triumphs full of trouble. But do not you think any thing in the world worth attaining, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul and unjust means.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="182"/>
IT was evidently the interest, both of King and par∣liament,
to finish their treaty with all expedition; and
endeavour, by their combined forces, to resist, if pos∣sible,
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surping fury of the army. It seemed even
the interest of the parliament, to leave, in the king's
hand, a considerable share of authority, by which he
might be enabled to protect them and himself, from so
dangerous an enemy. But the terms, on which they in∣sisted,
were so rigorous, that the King, fearing no worse
from the most implacable enemies, was in no haste to come
to a conclusion. And so great was the bigotry on both
sides, that they were willing to sacrifice the greatest civil
interests, rather than relinquish the most minute of their
theological contentions. From these causes, assisted by
the artifice of the independents, the treaty was spun out
to such a length, that the invasions and insurrections
<PB N="131" REF="183"/>
were every where subdued; and the army had leisure to
execute their violent and sanguinary projects.</P>
<P>HAMILTON, having entered England with a numer∣ous
tho' undisciplined army, durst not unite his forces<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil war an invasion re∣pressed.</NOTE>
with those of Langdale; because the English royalists
had refused to take the covenant; and the Scots presby∣terians,
tho' engaged for the King, refused to join them
on any other terms. The two armies marched together,
tho' at some distance; nor could even the approach of
the parliamentary army under Cromwel, oblige the co∣venanters
to consult their own safety, by a close union
with the royalists. When principles are so absurd and
so destructive of human society, it may safely be affirm∣ed,
that, the more sincere and the more disinterested
they are, they only become the more ridiculous and
odious.</P>
<P>CROMWEL feared not to oppose 8000 men, to the
numerous armies of 20,000, commanded by Hamilton
and Langdale. He attacked the latter by surprize, near
Preston in Lancashire<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">17th of August.</NOTE>; and, tho' the royalists made a
stout resistance, yet, not being succoured in time by their
confederates, they were almost entirely cut in pieces.
Hamilton was next attacked, put to rout, and pur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued
to Utoxeter, where he surrendered himself prisoner.
Cromwel followed his advantage; and marching into
Scotland with a considerable body, joined Argyle, who
was also in arms; and having suppressed Laneric, Monro,
and other moderate presbyterians, he placed the power
entirely in the hands of the violent party. The eccle∣siastical
authority, exalted above the civil, exercised
the severest vengeance on all those who had any share in
Hamilton's engagement; nor could any of that party re∣cover
trust, or even live in safety, but by doing solemn
and public penance for taking arms, by authority of par∣liament,
in defence of their lawful sovereign.</P>

THE chancellor, Loudon, who had, at first, counte∣nanced
Hamilton's enterprize, being terrified with the
menaces of the clergy, had, sometime before, gone over
to the other party; and he now, openly in the church,
tho' invested with the highest civil character in the king∣dom,
did penance for his obedience to the parliament,
which he termed a carnal self-seeking. He accompanied
his penance with so many tears, and such pathetical ad∣dressess
to the people for their prayers, in this his utter∣most
sorrow and distress, that an universal weeping and
lamentation took place among the deluded audience<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 360.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE loan of great sums of money, often to the ruin
of families, was exacted of all such as lay under any
suspicion of favouring the King's party, tho' their con∣duct
had been ever so inoffensive. This was a device,
fallen upon by the ruling party, in order, as they said,
to reach <HI>Heart-Malignant</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Guthrey.</NOTE>. Never in this Island, was
known a more severe and arbitrary government, than was
generally exercised, by the patrons of liberty in both
kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE siege of Colchester terminated in a manner no
less unfortunate than Hamilton's engagement, for the
royal cause. After suffering the utmost extremity of fa∣mine,
after feeding on the vilest aliments; the garrison
desired, at last, to capitulate. Fairfax required them to
surrender at mercy; and he gave such an explanation of
these terms, as to reserve to himself power, if he pleased,
to put them all instantly to the sword. The officers en∣deavoured,
tho' in vain, to persuade the soldiers, by
making a furious assault, to break thro', or at least, to
sell their lives as dear as possible. They were obliged<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of August.</NOTE>
to accept of the conditions offered; and Fairfax, insti∣gated
by Ireton, to whom Cromwel, in his absence,
had consigned over the government of the passive general,
seized Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, and re∣solved
<PB N="133" REF="187"/>
to make them instant sacrifices to military justice.
This unusual piece of severity was loudly exclaimed
against by all the prisoners. Lord Capel, fearless of
danger, reproached Ireton with it; and challenged him,
as they were all engaged in the same honourable cause,
to exercise the same impartial vengeance on all of them.
Lucas was first shot, and he gave, himself, orders to
fire, with the same alacrity, as if he had commanded a
platoon of his own soldiers. Lisle instantly ran and kissed
the dead body, and then chearfully presented himself to
a like fate. Thinking that the soldiers, destined for
his execution, stood at too great a distance, he called to
them to come nearer: One of them replied, <HI>I'll war∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt
you, Sir, we'll hit you:</HI> He answered smiling, <HI>Friends,
I have been nearer you when you have missed me.</HI> Thus pe∣rished
this generous spirit, not less beloved for his mo∣desty
and humanity, than esteemed for his courage and
military conduct.</P>
<P>SOON after, a gentleman, appearing in the King's pre∣sence,
clothed in mourning for Sir Charles Lucas; that
humane Prince, suddenly recollecting the hard fate of his
friends, paid them a tribute, which none of his own un∣paralleled
misfortunes ever extorted from him: He dis∣solved
into a flood of tears<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY these multiplied successes of the army, they had
subdued all their enemies; and none remained but the
helpless King and parliament, to oppose their violent
measures. From Cromwel's suggestion, a remonstrance
was drawn by the general council of officers, and sent
to the parliament. They there complain of the treaty
with the King; demand his punishment for the blood
spilt during the war; require a dissolution of the present
parliament, and a more equal representative for the fu∣ture;
and assert, that, tho' servants, they are intitled to
<PB N="134" REF="188"/>
represent these important points to their masters, who
are themselves no better than servants and trustees of the
people. At the same time, they advance with the army
to Windsor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King seized again by the army.</NOTE> and send Colonel Eure to seize the King's
person at Newport, and convey him to Hurst castle in
the neighbourhood, where he was reduced to very strict
confinement.</P>
<P>THIS measure being foreseen some time before, the
King was exhorted to make his escape, which was con∣ceived
to be very easy: But having given his word to
the parliament not to attempt the recovery of his liberty
during the treaty, and three weeks afterwards; he would
not, by any persuasion, be induced to hazard the re∣proach
of violating his promise. In vain was it urged,
that a promise, given to the parliament, could no longer
be binding; since they could no longer afford him pro∣tection
from violence, threatened him by other persons,
to whom he was bound by no tye or engagement. The
King would indulge no refinements of casuistry, how∣ever
plausible, in such delicate subjects; and was re∣solved,
that whatever depredations fortune should com∣mit
upon him, she never should bereave him of his ho∣nour<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Col. Cooke's Memoirs, p. 174. Rush. vol. viii. p. 1347.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE parliament lost not courage, notwithstanding the
danger, with which they were so nearly menaced. Tho'
without any plan for resisting military usurpations, they
generously resolved to withstand them to the utmost; and
rather to bring on a violent and visible subversion of go∣vernment,
than lend their authority to those illegal and
sanguinary measures, which were projected. They set
aside the remonstrance of the army, without deigning to
answer it; they voted the seizing the King's person, to
be without their consent, and sent a message to the ge∣neral,
to know by what authority that enterprize had
<PB N="135" REF="189"/>
been executed; and they issued orders, that the army
should advance no nearer London.</P>
<P>HOLLIS, the present leader of the presbyterians, was
a man of the most unconquerable intrepidity; and many
others of that party seconded his magnanimous spirit. It
was proposed by them, that the generals and principal of∣ficers,
should, for their disobedience and usurpations, be
proclaimed traitors by the parliament.</P>
<P>BUT the parliament were dealing with men, who
would not be frightened by words, nor retarded by any
scrupulous delicacy. The generals, under the name of
Fairfax, (for he still allowed them to employ his name)
marched the army to London, and placing guards in
Whitehall, the Meuse, St. James's, Durham-house, Co∣vent-garden,
and Palace-yard, surrounded the parlia∣ment
with their hostile armaments.</P>
<P>THE parliament, destitute of all hopes of prevailing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December 6. The house purged.</NOTE>
retained, however, courage to resist. They attempted,
in the face of the army, to close their treaty with the
King; and, tho' they had formerly voted his concessions
with regard to the church and delinquents to be unsatis∣factory,
they now took into consideration the final resolu∣tion
with regard to the whole. After a violent debate of
three days, it was carried, by a majority of 129 against
83, in the house of commons, that the King's conces∣sions
were a foundation for the houses to proceed upon in
the settlement of the kingdom.</P>
<P>NEXT day, when the commons were to meet, Colo∣nel
Pride, formerly a drayman, had blockaded the house,
at the head of two regiments; and, directed by the Lord
Grey of Groby, he seized in the passage, forty-one
members of the presbyterian party, and sent them to a
low room, which passed by the denomination of <HI>Hell;</HI>
whence they were afterwards carried to several inns.
Above 160 members more were excluded; and none
were allowed to enter but the most furious and most de∣termined
<PB N="134" REF="190"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="135" REF="191"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="136" REF="192"/>
of the independents; and these exceeded not
the number of fifty or sixty. This atrocious invasion of
the parliament, commonly passed under the name of <HI>Co∣lonel
Pride's purge;</HI> so much disposed were the nation to
make merry with the dethroning of those members, who
had violently arrogated the whole authority of govern∣ment,
and deprived the King of his legal prerogatives.</P>
<P>THE subsequent acts of the parliament, if this dimi∣nutive
assembly deserves that honourable name, retain
not the least appearance of law, equity, or freedom.
They instantly reversed the former vote, and declared
the King's concessions unsatisfactory. They determined,
that no members, absent at this last vote, should be re∣ceived,
till they subscribed it, as agreeable to their judg∣ment.
They renewed their former vote of non-addresses.
And they committed to prison, Sir William Waller,
Sir John Clotworthy, the generals, Massey, Brown, and
Copley, and other leaders of the presbyterians. These
men, by their credit and authority, which was then very
high, had, at the commencement of the war, supported
the parliament; and thereby prepared the way for the
greatness of the present leaders, who, at that time, were
of very small account in the nation.</P>
<P>THE secluded members having published a paper, con∣taining
a narrative of the violence, which had been ex∣ercised
upon them, and a protestation, that all acts were
void, which, from that time, had been transacted in
the house of commons; the remaining members encoun∣tered
it with a declaration, in which they pronounced it
false, scandalous, seditious, and tending to the destruc∣tion
of the visible and fundamental government of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>THESE sudden and violent revolutions held the whole
nation in terror and astonishment. Every man dreaded
to be trampled under foot, in the contention between
those mighty powers, which disputed for the sovereignty
<PB N="137" REF="193"/>
of the state. Many began to withdraw their effects be∣yond
sea: Foreigners scrupled to give any credit to a
people, so torn by domestic factions, and oppressed by
military usurpation: Even the internal commerce of the
kingdom began to stagnate: And in order to remedy
these growing evils, the generals, in the army's name,
published a declaration, in which they expressed their re∣solution
of supporting law and justice<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. viii. p. 1364.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE more to quiet the minds of men, the council of
officers took into consideration, a scheme called <HI>The
agreement of the people;</HI> being the plan of a republic, to
be substituted in the place of that government which
they had so violently pulled in pieces. Many parts of
this scheme, for correcting the inequalities of the repre∣sentative,
are very plausible; had the nation been will∣ing
to receive it, or had the army intended to impose it.
Other parts are too perfect for human nature, and sa∣vour
strongly of that fanatical spirit so prevalent through∣out
the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE height of all iniquity and fanatical extravagance
yet remained; the public trial and execution of their so∣vereign.
To this period was every measure precipitated
by the zealous independents. The parliamentary leaders
of that party had intended, that the army should, them∣selves,
execute that daring enterprize; and they deemed
so irregular and lawless a deed, best fitted to such irre∣gular
and lawless instruments<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke.</NOTE>. But the generals were
too wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to load themselves singly with the infamy,
which, they knew, must attend an action, so shocking
to the general sentiments of mankind. The parliament,
they were resolved, should share with them the reproach
of a measure, which was thought requisite for the ad∣vancement
of their common ends of safety and ambi∣tion.
In the house of commons, therefore, a committee
<PB N="138" REF="194"/>
was appointed to bring in a charge against the King.
On their report a vote passed, declaring it treason in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
king, to levy war against his parliament, and appointing
a HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE to try his Majesty for this
new invented treason. This vote was sent up to the
house of peers.</P>
<P>THE house of peers, during the civil wars, had, all
along, been of small account; but it had lately, since
the King's fall, become totally contemptible; and very
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew members would submit to the mortification of at∣tending
it. It happened, that day, to be fuller than
usual, and they were assembled to the number of six∣teen.
Without one dissenting voice, and almost without
deliberation, they instantly rejected the vote of the lower
house, and adjourned themselves for ten days; hoping,
that this delay would be able to retard the furious career
of the commons.</P>
<P>THE commons were not to be stopped by so small an
obstacle. Having first established a principle, which is
noble in itself, and seems specious, but is belied by all
history and experience, <HI>That the people are the origin of all
just power;</HI> they likewise declared, that the commons of
England, assembled in parliament, being chosen by the
people, and representing them, have the supreme autho∣rity
of the nation, and that whatever is enacted and de∣clared
law by the commons, hath the force of law, with∣out
the consent of king or house of peers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">January 4.</NOTE> The ordi∣nance
for the trial of Charles Stuart, king of England,
so they called him, was again read and unanimously as∣sented
to.</P>
<P>IN proportion to the enormity of the violences and
usurpations, were augmented the pretences of sanctity,
among those regicides. “Should any one have volun∣tarily
proposed,” said Cromwel in the house, “to
<PB N="139" REF="195"/>
bring the King to punishment, I should have regarded
him as the greatest traytor; but, since providence
and necessity have cast us upon it, I will pray to God
for a blessing on your councils; tho' I am not pre∣pared
to give you any advice on this important occa∣sion.
Even I myself,” subjoined he, “when I was
lately offering up petitions for his Majesty's restora∣tion,
felt my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
and considered this supernatural movement as the an∣swer,
which Heaven, having rejected the King, had
sent to my supplications”.</P>
<P>A woman of Hertfordshire, illuminated by prophetical
visions, desired admittance into the council of war, and
communicated to them a revelation, which assured them,
that their measures were consecrated from above, and ra∣tified
by a heavenly sanction. This intelligence gave
them great comfort, and much confirmed them in their
present resolutions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 360.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COLONEL Harrison, the son of a butcher, and the most
furious enthusiast of the army, was sent with a strong
party to conduct the King to London. At Windsor,
Hamilton, who was there detained a prisoner, was ad∣mitted
into the King's presence; and falling on his
knees, passionately exclaimed, <HI>My dear master! I have
indeed been so to you,</HI> replied Charles, embracing him.
No farther intercourse was allowed between them. The
King was instantly hurried away. Hamilton long fol∣lowed
him with his eyes, all suffused in tears, and prog∣nosticated,
that, in this short salutation, he had given
the last adieu to his sovereign and his friend.</P>
<P>CHARLES himself was assured, that the period of his
life was now approaching; but notwithstanding all the
preparations, which were making, and the intelligence,
which he received, he could not, even yet, believe, that
<PB N="138" REF="196"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="139" REF="197"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="140" REF="198"/>
his enemies really meant to conclude their violences by
a public trial and execution. A private assassination he
every moment looked for; and tho' Harrison assured
him, that his apprehensions were intirely groundless, it
was by that catastrophe, so frequent with dethroned
princes, that he expected to terminate his life. In ap∣pearance,
as well as reality, the King was now de∣throned.
All the exterior symbols of sovereignty were
withdrawn, and his attendants had orders to serve him
without ceremony. At first, he was shocked with in∣stances
of rudeness and familiarity, to which he had been
so little accustomed. <HI>Nothing so contemptible as a despised
prince!</HI> was the reflection, which they suggested to him.
But he soon reconciled his mind to this, as he had done
to his other calamities.</P>
<P>ALL the circumstances of the trial were now adjusted;
and the high court of justice fully constituted. It con∣sisted
of 133 persons, as named by the commons; but
there never met above 70: So difficult was it found, not∣withstanding
the blindness of prejudice, and the allurements
of interest, to engage men of any name or character in
that criminal measure. Cromwel, Ireton, Harrison, and
the chief officers of the army, most of them of very
mean birth, were members, together with some of the
lower house and some citizens of London. The twelve
judges were at first appointed in the number: But as
they had affirmed, that it was contrary to all the ideas of
English law to try the King for treason, by whose au∣thority
all accusations for treason must necessarily be con∣ducted;
their names, as well as those of some peers,
were afterwards struck out. Bradshaw, a lawyer, was
chosen president. Coke was appointed sollicitor for the
people of England. Dorislaus, Steele, and Aske, were
named assistants. The court sat in Westminster-hall.</P>
<P>IT is observable, that, in calling over the court, when
the crier pronounced the name of Fairfax, which had
<PB N="141" REF="199"/>
been inserted in the number, a voice came from one of
the spectators, and cried, <HI>He has more wit than to be here.</HI>
When the charge was read against the King, <HI>In the name
of the people of England;</HI> the same voice exclaimed, <HI>Not a
tenth part of them.</HI> Axtel the officer, who guarded the
court, giving orders to fire into the box, whence these
insolent speeches came; it was discovered, that Lady
Fairfax was there, and that it was she who had had the
courage to utter them. She was a person of very noble
extraction, the daughter of Horace Lord Vere of Til∣bury;
but being seduced by the violence of the times,
she had long seconded her husband's zeal against the royal
cause, and was now, as well as he, struck with abhor∣rence
at the fatal and unexpected consequence of all his
boasted victories.</P>
<P>THE pomp, the dignity, the ceremony of this tran∣saction<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's trial.</NOTE>
corresponded to the greatest conception, that is
suggested in the annals of human kind; the delegates of
a great people sitting in judgment upon their supreme
magistrate and trying him for his misgovernment and
breach of trust. The sollicitor, in name of the com∣mons,
represented, that Charles Stuart, being admitted
king of England, and <HI>entrusted</HI> with a limited power;
yet nevertheless, out of a wicked design to erect an un∣limited
and tyrannical government, had traiterously and
maliciously levied war against the present parliament, and
the people, whom they represented, and was therefore
impeached as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and a public
and implacable enemy to the commonwealth. After the
charge was finished, the president directed his discourse
to the King, and told him, that the court expected his
answer.</P>
<P>THE King, tho' long detained a prisoner, and now
produced as a criminal, sustained, by his magnanimous
courage, the majesty of a monarch. With great tem∣per
<PB N="142" REF="200"/>
and dignity, he declined the authority of the court,
and refused to submit himself to their jurisdiction. He
represented, That, having been engaged in treaty with
his two houses of parliament, and having finished almost
every article, he had expected to be brought to his ca∣pital
in another manner, and ere this time, to have been
restored to his power, dignity, revenue, as well as to
his personal liberty: That he could not now perceive
any appearance of the upper house, so essential a mem∣ber
of the constitution; and had learned, that even the
commons, whose authority was pretended, were subdued
by lawless force, and were bereaved of their liberty:
That he himself was their NATIVE HEREDITARY KING;
nor was the whole authority of the state, tho' free and
united, intitled to try him, who derived his dignity from
the Supreme Majesty of Heaven: That, admitting those
extravagant principles, which levelled all orders of men,
the court could plead no power, delegated by the people;
unless the consent of every individual, down to the
meanest and most ignorant peasant, had been previously
asked and obtained: That he acknowledged, without
scruple, that he had a <HI>trust,</HI> committed to him, and
one most sacred and inviolable; he was entrusted with
the liberties of his people, and would not now betray
them, by recognizing a power, founded on the most atro∣cious
violence and usurpation: That having taken arms,
and frequently exposed his life, in defence of public li∣berty,
of the constitution, of the fundamental laws of
the kingdom, he was willing, in this last and most so∣lemn
scene, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal with his blood those precious rights,
for which, tho' in vain, he had so long contended: That
those, who arrogated a title to sit as his judges, were
born his subjects, and born subjects to those laws,
which determined, <HI>That the king can do no wrong:</HI> That
he was not reduced to the necessity of sheltering himself
under that general maxim, which guards every English
<PB N="143" REF="201"/>
monarch, even the least deserving; but was able, by the
most satisfactory reasons, to justify those measures, in
which he had been engaged: That, to the whole world,
and even to them, his pretended judges, he was desirous,
if called upon in another manner, to prove the integrity
of his conduct, and assert the justice of those defensive
arms, to which, unwillingly and unfortunately, he had
had recourse: But that, in order to preserve an uniformity
of conduct, he muft, at present, forego the apology of
his innocence; le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, by ratifying an authority, no better
founded than that of robbers and pyrates, he be justly
branded as the betrayer, instead of being applauded as
the martyr, of the constitution.</P>
<P>THE president, in order to support the majesty of the
people, and maintain the superiority of his court above
the prisoner, still inculcated, That he must not decline
the authority of his judges; that they over-ruled his ob∣jections;
that they were delegated by the people, the
only source of every lawful power; and that kings
themselves acted but in trust from that community, which
had invested this high court of justice with its jurisdiction.
Even according to those principles, which, in his present
situation, he was perhaps obliged to adopt, his behaviour,
in general, will appear not a little harsh and barbarous;
but when we consider him as a subject, and one too of
no high character, addressing himself to his unfortunate
sovereign, his style will be esteemed, to the last degree,
audacious and insolent.</P>
<P>THREE times was Charles produced before the court,
and as often declined their jurisdiction. On the fourth,
the judges having examined some witnesses, by whom it
was proved, that the King had appeared in arms against
the forces commissioned by the parliament, they pro∣nounced
sentence against him. He seemed very anxious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of Jan.</NOTE>
at this time, to be admitted to a conference with the two
<PB N="144" REF="202"/>
houses; and it was supposed, that he intended to resign
the crown to his son: But the court refused compliance,
and considered that request as nothing but a delay of
justice.</P>
<P>IT is confessed, that the King's behaviour, during
this last period of his life, does great honour to his me∣mory;
and that, in all appearances before his judges, he
never forgot his part, either as a prince or as a man. Firm
and intrepid, he maintained, in each reply, the utmost
perspecuity and justness both of thought and expression:
Mild and equable, he rose into no passion at that un∣usual
authority, which was assumed over him. His soul,
without effort or affectation, seemed only to remain in
the situation samiliar to it, and to look down with con∣tempt
on all the efforts of human malice and iniquity.
The soldiers, instigated by their superiors, were brought,
tho' with difficulty, to cry aloud for justice: <HI>Poor souls!</HI>
said the King to one of his attendants; <HI>for a little money
they would do as much against their commanders</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. viii. p, 1425.</NOTE>. Some of
them were permitted to go the utmost length of brutal in∣solence,
and to spit in his face, as he was conveyed along
the passage to the court. To excite a sentiment of piety,
was the only effect which this inhuman insult was able
to operate upon him.</P>
<P>THE people, tho' under the rod of lawless, unlimited
power, could not forbear, with the most ardent prayers,
to pour forth their wishes for his preservation; and, in
his present distress, they avowed <HI>him,</HI> by their generous
tears, for their monarch, whom, in their misguided fury,
they had before so violently rejected. The King was
softened at this moving scene, and expressed his gratitude
for their dutiful affection. One soldier too, seized by
contagious sympathy, demanded from heaven a blessing
on oppressed and fallen majesty: His officer, over-hear∣ing
<PB N="145" REF="203"/>
his prayer, beat him to the ground in the King's pre∣sence.
<HI>The punishment, methinks, exceeds the offence:</HI> This
was the reflection, which Charles formed on that occa∣sion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS soon as the intention of trying the King was known
in foreign nations, so enormous an action was exclaimed
against by the general voice of reason and humanity;
and all men, under whatever form of government they
were born, rejected this example, as the utmost effort of
undisguised usurpation, and the most heinous insult on
law and justice. The French ambassador, by orders from
his court, interposed on the King's behalf: The Dutch
employed their good offices: The Scots exclaimed and
protested against this violence: The Queen, the Prince,
wrote pathetic letters to the parliament. All sollicita∣tions
were found fruitless with men whose resolutions
were fixed and irrevocable.</P>
<P>FOUR of Charles's friends, persons of the greatest vir∣tue
and dignity, Richmond, Hertford, Southampton,
Lindesey, applied to the commons. They represented,
That they were the King's counsellors, and had con∣curred,
by their advice, with all those measure; which
were now imputed as crimes to their royal master: That,
in the eye of the law, and according to the dictates of
common reason, they alone were guilty, and were alone
exposed to censure for every blameable action of the
prince: And that they now presented themselves, in or∣der
to save, by their own punishment, that precious life,
which it became the commons themselves, and every
subject, with the utmost hazard, to protect and defend<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Perinchef, p. 85. Lloyde, p. 319.</NOTE>.
Such a generous effort contributed to their honour; but
operated nothing towards the King's safety.</P>
<P>THE people remained in that silence and astonish∣ment,
which all great passions, when they have not an
<PB N="146" REF="204"/>
opportunity of exerting themselves, naturally produce in
the human mind. The soldiers, being incessantly plied
with prayers, sermons, and exhortations, were wrought
up to a degree of fury, and imagined, that, in the acts
of the most extreme disloyalty towards their prince, con∣sisted
their highest merit in the eyes of Heaven<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet's History of his own Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THREE days were allowed the King between his sen∣tence
and his execution. This interval he passed with
great tranquillity chiefly in reading and devotion. All
his family, that remained in England, were allowed ac∣cess
to him. It consisted only of the Princess Elizabeth
and the Duke of Glocester; for the Duke of York
had made his escape. Glocester was little more than
an infant: The Princess, notwithstanding her tender
years, shewed a very advanced judgment; and the cala∣mities
of her family had made a deep impression upon
her. After many pious consolations and advices, the
King gave her in charge to tell the Queen, That, during
the whole course of his life, he had never once, even in
thought, failed in his fidelity towards her; and that his
conjugal tenderness and his life should have an equal
duration.</P>
<P>TO the young Duke too, he could not forbear giving
some advice, in order to season his mind with early prin∣ciples
of loyalty and obedience towards his brother, who
was so soon to be his sovereign. Holding him on his
knee, he said, “Now they will cut off thy father's
head.” At these words, the child looked very sted∣fastly
upon him. “Mark! child, what I say: They
will cut off my head! and perhaps make thee a king:
But mark what I say: Thou must not be a king, as long
as thy brothers, Charles and James, are alive. They
will cut off thy brother's heads, when they can catch
them! And thy head too they will cut off at last!
<PB N="147" REF="205"/>
And therefore I charge thee do not be made a king
by them!” The Duke, sighing, replied, “I will
be torn in pieces first!” So determined an answer,
from one of such tender years, filled the King's eyes
with tears of joy and admiration.</P>
<P>EVERY night, during this interval, the King slept
sound as usual; tho' the noise of workmen, employed
in framing the scaffold, and other preparations for his exe∣cution,
continually resounded in his ears<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clement Walker's history of independency.</NOTE>. The morn∣ing
of the fatal day, he rose early; and calling Herbert,
one of his attendants, he bade him employ more than
usual care in dressing him, and preparing him for so
great and joyful a solemnity. Bishop Juxon, a man en∣dowed
with the same mild and steddy virtues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of Jan.</NOTE> by which
the King himself was so much distinguished, assisted
him in his devotions, and paid the last melancholy duties
to his friend and sovereign.</P>
<P>THE street before Whitehall was the place destined
for the execution: For it was intended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Execu∣tion.</NOTE> by choosing that
very place, in sight of his own palace, to display more
evidently the triumph of popular justice over royal ma∣jesty.
When the King came upon the scaffold, he
found it so surrounded with soldiers, that he could not
expect to be heard by any of the people: He addressed,
therefore, his discourse to the few persons who were
about him; particularly Colonel Tomlinson, to whose
care he had lately been committed, and upon whom, as
upon many others, his amiable deportment had operated
an intire conversion. He justified his own innocence in
the late fatal wars, and observed, that he had not taken
arms, till after the parliament had inlisted forces; nor
had he any other object in his warlike operations, than
to preserve that authority intire, which his ancestors had
transmitted to him. He threw not, however, the blame
<PB N="148" REF="206"/>
upon the parliament; but was more inclined to think
that ill instruments had interposed, and excited in them
fears and jealousies with regard to his intentions. Tho'
innocent towards his people, he acknowledged the equity
of his execution in the eyes of his Maker; and ob∣served,
that an unjust sentence which he had suffered to
take effect, was now punished by an unjust sentence
upon himself. He forgave all his enemies, even the chief
instruments of his death; but exhorted them and the
whole nation to return to the way of peace, by paying
obedience to their lawful sovereign, his son and succes∣sor.
When he was preparing himself for the block, Bi∣shop
Juxon called to him: “There is, Sir, but one
stage more, which, tho' turbulent and troublesome, is
yet a very short one. Consider, it will soon carry you
a great way; it will carry you from earth to heaven;
and there you shall find, to your great joy, the prize,
to which you hasten, a crown of glory.” I go,” re∣plied
the King, “from a corruptible to an incorruptible
crown; where no disturbance can have place.” At
one blow was his head severed from his body. A man
in a vizor performed the office of executioner: Another,
in a like disguise, held up, to the spectators, the head,
streaming with blood, and cried aloud, <HI>This is the head of
a traitor!</HI></P>
<P>IT is impossible to describe the grief, indignation, and
astonishment, which took place, not only among the
spectators, who were overwhelmed with a flood of sor∣row,
but throughout the whole nation, so soon as the
report of this fatal execution was conveyed to them.
Never monarch, in the full triumph of success and victo∣ry,
was more dear to his people than his misfortunes and
magnanimity, his patience and piety, had rendered this
unhappy Prince. In proportion to their former delusions,
which had animated them against him, was the violence
<PB N="149" REF="207"/>
of their return to duty and affection; while each re∣proached
himself, either with active disloyalty towards
him, or with too indolent defence of his oppressed cause.
On weaker minds, the effects of these complicated pas∣sions
were prodigious. Women are said to have cast
forth the untimely fruit of their womb: Others fell into
convulsions, or sunk into such a melancholy as attended
them to their grave: Nay some, unmindful of them∣selves,
as tho' they could not, or would not survive their
beloved prince, it is reported, suddenly fell down dead.
The very pulpits were bedewed with unsuborned tears;
those pulpits, which had formerly thundered out the most
violent imprecations and anathemas against him. And
all men united in their detestation of those hypocritical
parricides, who, by sanctified pretences, had so long dis∣guised
their treasons, and in this last act of iniquity,
had thrown an indelible stain upon the nation.</P>
<P>A fresh instance of hypocrisy was displayed the very
day of the King's death. The generous Fairfax, not
contended with being absent from the trial, had used
all the interest, which he yet retained, to prevent the
execution of the fatal sentence; and had even employed
persuasion with his own regiment, tho' none else should
follow him, to rescue the King from his disloyal mur∣derers.
Cromwel and Ireton, informed of this inten∣tion,
endeavoured to convince him, that the Lord had
rejected the King; and they exhorted him to seek by
prayer some direction from Heaven on this important oc∣casion:
But they concealed from him, that they had al∣ready
signed the warrant for the execution. Harrison
was the person appointed to join in prayer with the un∣wary
general. By agreement, he prolonged his doleful
cant, till intelligence arrived, that the fatal blow was
struck. He then rose from his knees, and insisted with
Fairfax, that this event was a miraculous and providen∣tial

answer, whch Heaven had sent to their devout sup∣plications<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 135.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT being remarked, that the King, the moment be∣fore
he stretched out his neck to the executioner, had
said to Juxon, with a very earnest accent, the single
word, REMEMBER; great mysteries were supposed to be
concealed under that expression, and the generals vehe∣mently
insisted with the prelate, that he should inform
them of the King's meaning. Juxon told them, that the
King, having frequently charged him to inculcate on his
son the forgiveness of his murderers, had taken this op∣portunity,
in the last moment of his life, when his com∣mands,
he supposed, would be regarded as sacred and in∣violable,
to re-iterate that desire: and that his mild spi∣rit
thus terminated its present course, by an act of bene∣volence
towards his greatest enemies.</P>
<P>THE character of this Prince, as that of most men,
if not of all men, was mixed; but his virtues predomi∣nated
extremely above his vices, or, more properly speak∣ing,
his imperfections: For scarce any of his faults rose
to that pitch as to merit the appellation of vices. To
consider him in the most favourable light, it may be af∣firmed,
that his dignity was exempted from pride, his
humanity from weakness, his bravery from rashness, his
temperance from austerity, his frugality from avarice:
All these virtues, in him, maintained their proper bounds,
and merited unreserved praise. To speak the most harshly
of him, we may affirm, that many of his good qualities
were attended with some latent frailty, which, tho'
seemingly inconsiderable, was able, when seconded by
the extreme malevolence of his fortune, to disappoint
them of all their influence: His beneficent disposition
was clouded by a manner not very gracious; his virtue
was tinctured with superstition; his good sense was dis∣figured
<PB N="151" REF="211"/>
by a deference to persons of a capacity much in∣ferior
to his own; and his moderate temper exempted
him not from hasty and precipitant resolutions. He de∣serves
the epithet of a good, rather than of a great man;
and was more fitted to rule in a regular established go∣vernment,
than either to give way to the encroachments
of a popular assembly, or finally to subdue their preten∣sions.
He wanted suppleness and dexterity sufficient for
the first measure: He was not endowed with the vigour
requisite for the second. Had he been born an absolute
prince, his humanity and good sense had rendered his
reign happy and his memory precious: Had the limita∣tions
on prerogative been, in his time, quite fixed and
certain, his integrity had made him regard, as sacred,
the boundaries of the constitution. Unhappily, his fate
threw him into a period, when the precedents of many
former reigns savoured strongly of arbitrary power, and
the genius of the people ran violently towards liberty.
And if his political prudence was not sufficient to ex∣tricate
him from so perilous a situation, he may be ex∣cused;
since, even after the event, when it is commonly
easy to correct all errors, one is at a loss to determine
what conduct, in his circumstances, could have main∣tained
the authority of the crown, and preserved the
peace of the nation. Exposed, without revenue, with∣out
arms, to the assault of furious, implacable and bi∣gotted
factions, it was never permitted him, but with
the most fatal consequences, to commit the smallest mis∣take;
a condition too rigorous to be imposed on the
greatest human capacity.</P>
<P>SOME historians have rashly questioned the good faith
of this Prince: But, for this reproach, the most malig∣nant
scrutiny of his conduct, which, in every circum∣stance,
is now thoroughly known, affords not any rea∣sonable
foundation. On the contrary, if we consider
the extreme difficulties, to which he was so frequently

<PB N="152" REF="214"/>
reduced, and compare the sincerity of his professions and
declarations; we shall avow, that probity and ho∣nour
ought justly to be numbered among his most shining
qualities. In every treaty, those concessions, which, he
thought, in conscience, he could not maintain, he never
could, by any motive or persuasion, be induced to make.
And though some violations of the petition of right may
be imputed to him; these are more to be ascribed to the
necessity of his situation, and to the lofty ideas of royal
prerogative, which he had imbibed, than to any failure
in the integrity of his principles<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The imputation of infincerity on Charles I. like many party-clamours, is very difficult to be removed; tho' it may not here be improper to say some∣what with regard to it. I shall first remark, that this imputation seems to be of a later growth than his own age; and that even his enemies, though they loaded him with many calumnies, did not insist on this accusation. Lud∣low, I think, is almost the only Parliamentarian, who imputes that vice to him; and how passionate a writer he is, must be obvious to every one. Nei∣ther Clarendon nor any other of the royalists ever justify him from insincerity; as not supposing that he had ever been accused of it. In the second place, his deportment and character in common life was free from that vice: He was reserved, distant, stately; cold in his address, plain in his discourse, inflexi∣ble in his principles; wide of the caressing, insinuating manners of his son; or the professing, talkative humour of his father. The imputation of insin∣cerity must be grounded on some of his public actions, which we are there∣fore in the third place to examine. The following are the only instances, which I find cited to confirm that accusation. (1.) His vouching Bucking∣ham's narrative of the transactions in Spain. But it is evident that Charles himself was deceived: why otherwise did he quarrel with Spain? The fol∣lowing is a passage of a letter from lord Kensington, ambassador in France, to the duke of Buckingham, Cabbala, p. 318. “But his highness (the Prince) had observed as great a weakness and folly as that, in that after they (the Spaniards) had used him so ill, they would suffer him to depart, which was one of the first speeches he uttered after he came into the ship: But did he say so? said the Queen (of France.) Yes, madam, I will as∣sure you, quoth I, from the witness of mine own ears. She smiled and replied, Indeed I heard he was used ill. So he was, answered I, but not in his entertainment; for that was as splendid as that country could af∣ford it; but in their frivolous delays, and in the unreasonable conditions which they propounded and pressed, upon the advantage they had of his princely person.” (2.) Bishop Burnet, in his History of the House of Hamilton, p. 154. has preserved a letter of the King's to the Scots bishops, in which he desires them not to be present at the parliament, where they would be forced to ratify the abolition of their own order: “For,” adds the King, “we do hereby assure you, that it shall be still one of our chiesest stu∣dies how to rectify and establish the government of that church aright, and to repair your losses, which we desired you to be most confident of.” And in another place, “You may rest secure, that though perhaps we may give way for the present to that which will be prejudicial both to the church and our own government; yet we shall not leave thinking in time how to remedy both.” But does the King say, that he will arbitrarily revoke his concessions? Does not candor require us rather to suppose, that he hoped his authority would so far recover as to enable him to obtain the national consent to re-establish episcopacy, which he believed so material a part of religion as well as of government? It is not easy indeed to think how he could expect to effectuate this purpose in any other way than his father had taken, that is, by consent of parliament. (3.) There is a passage in lord Clarendon, where it is said, that the King assented the more easily to the bill, which excluded the bishops from the House of Peers; because he thought, that that law, being enacted by force, could not be valid. But the King certainly reasoned right in that conclusion. Three fourths of the House of Peers were at that time banished by the violence of the populace: Twelve bishops were unjustly thrown into the Tower by the Commons: Great numbers of the Commons themselves were kept away by fear or violence: The King himself was forced to leave London. If all this be not force, there is no such thing. But this scruple of the King's affects only the bishops' bill, and that against pressing. The other constitutional laws had passed without the least appearance of vio∣lence, as did indeed all the bills passed during the first year, except Strafford's attainder, which could not be recalled. The parliament, therefore, even if they had known the King's sentiments in this particular, could have no just foundation of jealousy. (4.) The King's letter intercepted at Naseby, has been the source of much clamour. We have spoke of it already, chap. lviii. Perhaps, it had been better had the King avoided that refinement; yet no∣thing is more usual in all public transactions. After the death of Charles II. of Spain, King William's ambassadors gave the duke of Anjou the title of King of Spain: Yet at that very time King William was secretly forming alliances to de∣throne him: And soon after he refused him that title, and insisted (as he had rea∣son) that he had not acknowledged his right. Yet King William justly passes for a very sincere Prince; and this transaction is not regarded as any objection to his character. In all the negotiations at the peace of Ryswic, the French am∣bassadors always addressed King William as King of England; yet it was made an express article of the treaty, that the French King should acknow∣lege him as such. Such a palpable difference is there between giving a title to a Prince, and positively recognizing his right to it. I may add, that Charles when he inserted his protestation in the council-books before his council, surely thought he had reason to justify his counduct. There were too many men of honour in that company to avow a palpable cheat: To which we may subjoin, that, if men were as much disposed to judge of this Prince's actions with candor as severity, this precaution of entering a protest in his council-books might rather pass for a proof of scrupulous honour; left he should afterwards be reproached with breach of his word, when he should think proper again to declare the assembly at Westminster no parliament. (5.) The denying his commission to Glamorgan is another instance which has been cited. This matter has been already treated chap. lviii. That transaction was entirely innocent. Even if the King had given a commission to Glamorgan to con∣clude that treaty, and had ratified it, will any reasonable man, in our age, think it strange, that, in order to save his own life, his crown, his family, his friends, and his party, he should make a treaty with papifts, and grant them very large concessions for their religion. (6.) There is another of the King's intercepted letters to the Queen commonly mentioned; where, it is pretended, he talked of raising and then destroying Cromwel: But that story stands on no manner of foundation, as we have observed in chap. lix. In a word, the par∣liament, after the commencement of their violences, and still more, after be∣ginning the civil war, had reason for their scruples and jealousies, founded on the very nature of their situation, and on the general propensity of the hu∣man mind; not on any fault of the King's character; who was candid, sin∣cere, upright; as much almost as any man, whom we meet with in history.</NOTE>▪</P>

THIS Prince was of a comely presence; of a sweet,
but melancholy. aspect. His face was regular, handsome,
<PB N="154" REF="216"/>
and well complexioned; his body strong, healthy, and
justly proportioned; and being of a middle stature, he
was capable of enduring the greatest fatigues. He ex∣celled
in horsemanship and other exercises; and he pos∣sessed
all the exterior, as well as many of the essential
qualities, which form an accomplished prince.</P>
<P>THE tragical death of Charles begot a question, whe∣ther
the people, in any case, were intitled to judge and to
punish their sovereign; and most men, regarding chiefly
the atrocious usurpation of the pretended judges, and the
merit of the virtuous prince who suffered, were inclined
strongly to condemn the republican principles, as highly
seditious and extravagant: But there still were a few,
<PB N="155" REF="217"/>
who, abstracting from the particular circumstances of
this case, were able to consider the question in general,
and were inclined to moderate, not contradict, the pre∣vailing
sentiment. Such might have been their reason∣ing.
If ever, on any occasion, it were laudable to con∣ceal
truth from the populace; it must be confessed, that
the doctrine of resistance affords such an example; and
that all speculative reasoners ought to observe, with re∣gard
to this principle, the same cautious silence, which
the laws, in every species of government, have ever pre∣scribed
to themselves. Government is instituted, in or∣der
to restrain the fury and injustice of the people; and
being always founded on opinion, not on force, it is
dangerous to weaken, by these speculations, the reve∣rence,
which the multitude owe to authority, and to
instruct them beforehand, that the case can ever happen,
when they may be freed from their duty of allegiance.
Or should it be found impossible to restrain the licence
of human disquisitions, it must be acknowleged, that
the doctrine of obedience ought alone to be <HI>inculcated,</HI>
and that the exceptions, which are very rare, ought
seldom or never to be mentioned in popular reasonings
and discourses. Nor is there any danger, that mankind,
by this prudent reserve, should universally degenerate in∣to
a state of abject servitude. When the exception re∣ally
occurs, even though it be not previously expected
and descanted on, it must, from its very nature, be so
obvious and undisputed, as to remove all doubt, and
overpower the restraint, however great, imposed by
teaching the general doctrine of obedience. But between
resisting a prince and dethroning him, there is a very
wide interval; and the abuses of power, which can war∣rant
the latter violence, are much greater and more enor∣mous,
than those which will justify the former. History,
however, supplies us with examples even of this kind;
and the reality of the supposition, though, for the fu∣ture,
<PB N="156" REF="218"/>
it ought ever to be little looked for, must, by all
candid inquirers, be acknowledged in the past. But be∣tween
dethroning a prince and punishing him, there is
another very wide interval; and it were not strange, if
even men of the most enlarged thought should question,
whether human nature could ever, in any monarch,
reach that height of depravity, as to warrant, in revolt∣ed
subjects, this last act of extraordinary jurisdiction:
That illusion, if it be an illusion, which teaches us to
pay a sacred regard to the persons of princes, is so salu∣tary,
that to dissipate it by the formal trial and punish∣ment
of a sovereign, will have more pernicious effects
upon the people, than the example of justice can be
supposed to have a beneficial influence upon princes, by
checking their career of tyranny. 'Tis dangerous also,
by these examples, to reduce princes to despair, or
bring matters to such extremities against persons endow∣ed
with great power, as to leave them no resource, but
in the most violent and most sanguinary councils. This
general position being established, it must, however, be
observed, that no reader, almost of any party or prin∣ciple,
was ever shocked, when he read, in antient his∣tory,
that the Roman senate voted Nero, their absolute
sovereign, to be a public enemy, and, even without
trial, condemned him to the severest and most ignomini∣ous
punishment; such a punishment, as the meanest
Roman citizen was, by the laws, exempted from. The
crimes of that bloody tyrant are so enormous, that they
break through all rules; and extort a confession, that
such a dethroned prince is no longer superior to his peo∣ple,
and can no longer plead, in his own defence, laws,
which were established for conducting the ordinary
course of administration. But when we pass from the
case of Nero to that of Charles, the great disproportion,
or rather total contrariety of characters, immediately
strikes us; and we stand astonished, that, among a ci∣vilized
<PB N="157" REF="219"/>
people, so much virtue could ever meet with so fa∣tal
a catastrophe. History, the great mistress of wisdom,
furnishes examples of all kinds; and every prudential,
as well as moral precept, may be authorized by those
events, which her enlarged mirror is able to present to
us. From the memorable revolutions, which passed in
England during this period, we may naturally deduce
the same useful lesson, which Charles himself, in his
latter years, inferred; that it is very dangerous for
princes to assume more authority, than the laws have
allowed them. But, it must be confessed, that these
events furnish us with another instruction, no less natu∣ral,
and no less useful, concerning the madness of the
people, the furies of fanaticism, and the danger of mer∣cenary armies.</P>
<P>IN order to close this part of British history,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Feb.</NOTE> it is also
necessary to relate the dissolution of the monarchy in
England: That event soon followed upon the death of
the monarch. When the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on the day, ap∣pointed
in their adjournment, they entered upon busi∣ness,
and sent down some votes to the commons, of
which the latter deigned not to take the least notice. In
a few days, the lower house passed a vote, that they
should make no more addresses to the house of peers, nor
receive any more from them; and that that house was
useless and dangerous, and was therefore to be abolish∣ed.
A like vote passed with regard to the monarchy;
and 'tis remarkable, that Martin, a zealous republican,
in the debate on this question, confessed, that, if they
desired a king, the last was as proper as any gentleman
in England<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Walker's history of independency, part 2.</NOTE>. The commons formed a new great seal,
on which that assembly was represented with this le∣gend,
ON THE FIRST YEAR OF FREEDOM, BY GOD's
BLESSING, RESTORED, 1648. The forms of all pub∣lic
business were changed, from the king's name, to that

declared high treason to proclaim, or any otherwise ac∣knowledge

Cromwel, sent beyond sea.</P>

<P>DUKE HAMILTON was tried by a new high court of
justice, as Earl of Cambridge in England; and con∣demned
for high treason. This sentence, which was
certainly very hard, but which ought to save his me∣mory
from all imputations of treachery to his master,
was executed on a scaffold, erected before Westminster-hall.
Lord Capel underwent the same fate▪ Both these
noblemen had escaped from prison, but were afterwards
discovered and taken. To all the sollicitations of their
friends for pardon, the generals and parliamentary leaders
still replied, that it was certainly the intention of Pro∣vidence
they should suffer; since it had permitted them
to fall into their enemies hands, after they had once re∣covered
their liberty.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Holland lost his life by a like sentence.
Though of a polite and courtly behaviour, he died la∣mented
by no party. His ingratitude to the King, and
his frequent changing sides, were regarded as great stains
on his memory. The Earl of Norwich and Sir John
Owen, being condemned by the same court, were par∣doned
by the commons.</P>

<P>IT may be expected that we should here make mention
of the <HI>Icon Basiliké,</HI> a work published in the King's name
a few days after his execution. It seems almost impos∣sible,
in the controverted parts of history, to say any
thing which will satisfy the zealots of both parties: But
with regard to the genuineness of that production, it is
not easy for an historian to six any opinion, which will
be intirely to his own satisfaction. The proofs brought
to evince that this work is or is not the King's, are so
convincing, that, if an impartial reader peruses any one side
apart<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See on the one hand, Toland's Amyntor, and on the other, Wagstasse's Vindication of the royal martyr, 3d edition, with Young's addition. We may remark, that Lord Clarendon's total silence with regard to this subject, in so full a history, composed in vindication of the King's measures and cha∣racter, forms a strong presumption on Toland's side, and a presumption of which that author was ignorant; the works of the noble historian not being then published. Bishop Burnet's testimony too must be allowed of weight against the <HI>Icon.</HI></NOTE>, he will thing it impossible, that arguments could
be produced, sufficient to counter-ballance so strong an
evidence: And when he compares both sides, he will be
<PB N="160" REF="222"/>
some time at a loss to fix any determination. Should an
absolute suspence of judgment be found difficult or dis∣agreeable
in so interesting a question, I must confess,
that I much incline to give the preference to the argu∣ments
of the royalists. The testimonies, which prove
that performance to be the King's, are more numerous,
certain, and direct, than those on the other side. This
is the case, even if we consider the external evidence:
But when we weigh the internal, derived from the style
and composition, there is no manner of comparison.
These meditations resemble in elegance, purity, neat∣ness,
and simplicity, the genius of those performances,
which we know with certainty to have flowed from the
royal pen: But are so unlike the bombast, perplexed,
rhetorical, and corrupt style of Dr. Gauden, to whom
they are ascribed, that no human testimony seems suffi∣cient
to convince us, that he was the author. Yet all
the evidences, which would rob the King of that hon∣our,
tend to prove, that Dr. Gauden had the merit of
writing so fine a performance, and the infamy of im∣posing
it on the world for the King's.</P>
<P>IT is not easy to conceive the general compassion ex∣cited
towards the King, by the publishing, at so critical
a juncture, a work so full of piety, meekness, and hu∣manity.
Many have not scrupled to ascribe to that
book the subsequent restoration of the royal family.
Milton compares its effects to those which were wrought
on the tumultuous Romans by Anthony's reading to
them the will of Caesar. The <HI>Icon</HI> passed through fifty
editions in a twelvemonth; and independent of the
great interest taken in it by the nation, as the supposed
production of their murdered sovereign, it must be ac∣knowleged
the best prose composition, which, at the
time of its publication, was to be found in the English
language.</P>

<P>THE confusion which overspread England after the
murder of Charles the First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LX.</NOTE> proceeded as well
from the spirit of refinement and innovation, which
agitated the ruling party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eng∣</NOTE> as from the dissolution of all
that authority, both civil and ecclesiastical, by which
the nation had ever been accustomed to be governed.
Every man had framed the model of a republic; and,
however new it was, or fantastical, he was eager of re∣commending
it to his fellow citizens, or even of im∣posing
it by force upon them. Every man had adjusted
a system of religion, which, being derived from no tradi∣tional
authority, was peculiar to himself; and being
founded on supposed inspiration, not on any principles
of human reasoning, had no means, besides cant and
low rhetoric, by which it could recommend itself to
others. The Levellers insisted on an equal distribution
of property and power, and disclaimed all dependance
and subordination. The Millenarians or Fifth-Monar∣chy-men
required, that government itself should be
abolished, and all human powers be laid in the dust, in
order to pave the way for the dominion of Christ, whose
<PB N="162" REF="224"/>
second coming on earth they suddenly expected. The
Antinomians even insisted, that the obligations of mo∣rality
and natural law were suspended, and that the elect,
guided by an internal principle, more perfect and divine,
were superior to the <HI>beggarly elements</HI> of justice and humanity.
A considerable party declaimed against tythes and a hireling
priesthood, and were resolved that the magistrate should
not support by power or revenue any ecclesiastical esta∣blishment.
Another party inveighed against the law
and its professors; and on pretence of rendering more
simple the distribution of justice, were desirous of abo∣lishing
the whole system of English jurisprudence, which
seemed interwoven with monarchical government. Even
those among the republicans, who adopted not such ex∣travagancies,
were so intoxicated with their faintly cha∣racter,
that they supposed themselves possessed of peculiar
privileges; and all professions, oaths, laws, and engage∣ments
had, in a great measure, lost their influence over
them. The bands of society were every where loosened;
and the irregular passions of men were encouraged by
speculative principles, still more unsocial and irregular.</P>
<P>THE Royalists, consisting of the nobles and more con∣siderable
gentry, being degraded from their authority
and plundered of their property, were inflamed with the
highest resentment and indignation against those ignoble
adversaries, who had reduced them to subjection. The
presbyterians, whose credit had first supported the arms
of the parliament, were enraged to find, that, by the
treachery or superior cunning of their, associates, the
fruits of all their successful labours were ravished from
them. The former party, from inclination and prin∣ciple,
zealously attached themselves to the son of their
unfortunate Monarch, whose memory they respected,
and whose tragical death they deplored. The latter cast
their eye towards the same object; but they had still
many prejudices to overcome, many fears and jealousies
<PB N="163" REF="225"/>
to be allayed, ere they could cordially entertain thoughts
of restoring that family, whom they had so grievously
offended, and whose principles they regarded with such
violent abhorrence.</P>
<P>THE only solid support of the republican independent
faction, which, tho' it formed so small a part of the na∣tion,
had violently usurped the government of the whole,
was a numerous army of about fifty thousand men. But
this army, formidable from its discipline and courage,
as well as its numbers, was actuated by a spirit, that
rendered it extremely dangerous to the assembly, which
had assumed the command over it. Accustomed to in∣dulge
every chimera in politics, every frenzy in religion,
the soldiers knew little of the subordination of citizens,
and had only learned, from apparent necessity, some
maxims of military obedience. And while they still
maintained, that all those enormous violations of law
and equity, of which they had been guilty, were justi∣fied
by the success, with which providence had blessed
them; they were ready to break out into any new disor∣der,
wherever they had the prospect of a like sanction
and authority.</P>
<P>WHAT alone gave some poize and stability to all these
unsettled humours, was the great influence, both civil
and military, acquired by Oliver Cromwel. This man,
suited to the age in which he lived, and to that alone,
was equally qualified to gain the affection and confidence
of men, by what was mean, vulgar, and ridiculous in
his character; as to command their obedience by what
was great, daring, and enterprizing. Familiar even to
buffoonery with the meanest centinel, he never lost his
authority: Transported to a degree of madness with re∣ligious
extasies, he never forgot the political purposes,
to which they might serve. Hating monarchy, while a
subject; despising liberty, while a citizen; tho' he re∣tained
<PB N="164" REF="226"/>
for a time all orders of men under a seeming obe∣dience
to the parliament; he was secretly paving the
way, by artifice and courage, to his own unlimited au∣thority.</P>
<P>THE parliament, for so we must henceforth call a
small and inconsiderable part of the house of commons,
having murdered their Sovereign with so many appear∣ing
circumstances of solemnity and justice, and so much
real violence and even fury, began to assume more the
air of a civil, legal power, and to enlarge a little the
narrow bottom, upon which they stood. A few of the
excluded and absent members, such as were liable to
least exception, were admitted; but on condition, that
they should sign an approbation of whatever had been
done in their absence with regard to the King's trial:
And some of them were willing to acquire a share of
power on such terms: The greatest part disdained to
lend their authority to such apparent usurpations. They
issued some writs for new elections, in places where they
hoped to have interest enough to bring in their own
friends and dependants. They named a council of state
to the number of thirty eight, to whom all addresses
were made, who gave orders to all generals and admi∣rals,
who executed the laws, and who digested all bu∣siness
before it was introduced into parliament<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Their names were, the Earls of Denbigh, Mulgrave, Pembroke, Salisbu∣ry, Lords Grey, Fairfax, Lord Grey of Groby, Lord Lisle, Rolles, St. John, Wilde, Bradshaw, Cromwel, Skippon, Pickering, Massam, Haselrig, Har∣rington, Vane jun, Danvers, Armine, Mildmay, Constable, Pennington, Wilson, Whitlocke, Martin, Ludlow, Stapleton, Hevingham, Wallop, Hutchinson, Bond, Popham, Valentine, Walton, Scot, Purefoy, Jones.</NOTE>. They
pretended to employ themselves entirely in adjusting the
laws, forms, and methods of a new representative; and
so soon as they should have settled the nation, they pro∣fessed
their intention of restoring the power to the peo∣ple,
<PB N="165" REF="227"/>
from whom, they acknowledged, they had entirely
derived it.</P>
<P>THE Commonwealth found every thing in England
composed into a seeming tranquillity by the terror of
their arms. Foreign powers, occupied in wars among
themselves, had no leizure nor inclination to interpose
in the domestic dissensions of this island. The young
king, poor and neglected, living sometimes in Holland,
sometimes in France, sometimes in Jersey, comforted
himself, amidst his present distresses, with the hopes of
better fortune. The situation alone of Scotland and
Ireland gave any immediate inquietude to the new Re∣public.</P>
<P>AFTER the successive defeats of Montrose and Hamil∣ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Scotland.</NOTE>
and the ruin of their parties, the whole authority
in Scotland fell into the hands of Argyle and the rigid
churchmen, that party which was most averse to the in∣terests
of the royal family. Their enmity, however,
against the independents, who had prevented the long
wished for settlement of presbyterian discipline in Eng∣land,
carried them to embrace opposite maxims in their po∣litical
conduct. Tho' invited by the English parliament
to model their government into a republican form, they
resolved still to adhere to monarchy, which had ever pre∣vailed
in their country, and which, by the express terms
of their Covenant, they were obliged to defend. They
considered besides, that as the property of the kingdom
lay chiefly in the hands of great families, it would be
difficult to establish a Commonwealth, or without some
chief magistrate, invested with royal authority, to pre∣serve
peace or justice in the community. The execution
therefore, of the king, against which they had always
protested, having occasioned a vacancy of the
throne, they immediately proclaimed his son and succes∣sor,
Charles the second; but upon condition “of his
<PB N="166" REF="228"/>
good behaviour and strict observance of the Covenant,
and his entertaining no other persons about him but
such as were godly men and faithful to that obliga∣tion.”
These unusual clauses, inserted in the very
first acknowledgement of their Prince, sufficiently shewed
their intention of limiting extremely his authority. And
the English Commonwealth, having no pretence to in∣terpose
in the affairs of that kingdom, allowed the Scots,
for the present, to take their own measures in settling
their government.</P>
<P>THE dominion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Ireland.</NOTE> which England claimed over Ireland,
demanded more immediately their efforts for subouing
that country. In order to convey a just notion of Irish
affairs, it will be necessary to look backwards some years,
and to relate briefly those transactions, which had past
during the memorable revolutions in England. When
the late King agreed to that cessation of arms with the
Popish rebels<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1643.</NOTE>, which was become so requisite, as well
for the security of the Irish Protestants as for promoting
his interests in England, the Parliament, in order to
blacken his conduct, reproached him with favoring that
odious rebellion, and exclaimed loudly against the terms
of the cessation. They even went so far as to declare
it entirely null and invalid, because finished without
their consent.; and to this declaration the Scots in Ulster,
and the Earl of Inchiquin, a nobleman of great autho∣rity
in Munster, professed to adhere. By their means,
the war was still kept alive; but as the dangerous dis∣tractions
in England hindered the parliament from send∣ing
any considerable assistance to their allies in Ireland,
Inchiquin entered into an accommodation with Ormond,
whom the King had created Lord-Lieutenant of that
kingdom. This latter nobleman, being a native of Ire∣land,
and a person endowed with great prudence and
virtue, formed a scheme for composing the disorders of
<PB N="167" REF="229"/>
his country, and for engaging the rebel Irish to support
the cause of his royal master. There were many cir∣cumstances
which strongly invited the Irish to embrace
the King's party. The maxims of that Prince had al∣ways
led him to give a reasonable indulgence to the ca∣tholics
throughout all his dominions; and one principal
ground of that enmity, which the puritans professed
against him, was this tacit toleration. The parliament,
even when unprovoked, had ever menaced the papists with
the most rigid restraint, if not a total extirpation; and
immediately after the commencement of the Irish rebel∣lion,
they put to sale all the estates of the rebels, and had
engaged the public faith for transferring them to the ad∣venturers,
who had already advanced money upon that
security. The success, therefore, which the arms of
the parliament met with at Naseby, struck a just terror
into the Irish; and engaged the council of Kilkenny,
composed of deputies from all the catholic counties and
cities, to conclude a peace with the Marquess of Or∣mond<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1646.</NOTE>.
They professed to return to their duty and al∣legiance,
engaged to furnish ten thousand men for the
support of the King's authority in England, and were
contented with stipulating, in return, indemnity for
their rebellion and toleration of their religion.</P>
<P>ORMOND not doubting but a peace, so advantageous
and even necessary to the Irish, would be strictly ob∣served,
advanced with a small body of troops to Kil∣kenny,
in order to concert measures for common de∣fence
with his new allies. The pope had sent over to
Ireland a nuncio, Rinuccini, an Italian; and this man,
whose commission empowered him to direct the spiritual
concerns of the Irish, was emboldened, by their igno∣rance
and bigotry, to assume the chief authority in the
civil government. Foreseeing that a general submission
<PB N="168" REF="230"/>
to the Lord-Lieutenant would put an end to his own in∣fluence,
he conspired with Owen Oneal, who com∣manded
the native Irish in Ulster, and who bore a great
jealousy to Preston, the general chiefly trusted by the
council of Kilkenny. By concert, these two malcon∣tents
secretly drew forces together, and were ready to
fall on Ormond, who remained in security, trusting to
the pacification so lately concluded with the rebels. He
received intelligence of their treachery, made his retreat
with great celerity and conduct, and sheltered his small
army in Dublin and the other fortified towns, which
still remained in the hands of the Protestants.</P>
<P>THE nuncio, full of arrogance, levity, and ambition,
was not contented with this violation of treaty. He
summoned an assembly of the clergy at Waterford, and
engaged them to declare against that pacification, which
the civil council had concluded with their lawful sove∣reign.
He even thundered out a sentence of excommu∣nication
against all those who should adhere to a peace,
so prejudicial, as he pretended, to the catholic religion;
and the deluded Irish, terrified with his spiritual menaces,
ranged themselves every where on his side, and sub∣mitted
to his authority. Without scruple, he carried on
war against the Lord Lieutenant, and threatened with a
siege the protestant garrisons, which were, all of them,
very ill provided for defence.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the unfortunate King was necessitated
to take shelter in the Scots army; and being there re∣duced
to close confinement, and secluded from all com∣merce
with his friends, despaired, that his authority, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
even his liberty, would ever be restored to him. He
sent orders to Ormond, if he could not defend himself
rather to submit to the English than the Irish rebels▪
and accordingly the Lord Lieutenant, being reduced to
the last extremity, delivered up Dublin, Tredah, Dun∣dalk,
<PB N="169" REF="231"/>
and other garrisons to colonel Michael Jones, who
took possession of them in the name of the English par∣liament.
Ormond himself went over to England, was
admitted to the King's presence, received a grateful ac∣knowlegement
for his past services, and during some
time lived in tranquillity near London. But being ba∣nished,
with the other royalists, to a distance from that
city, and seeing every event turn out unfortunately for
his royal master, and threaten him with a catastrophe
still more direful, he thought proper to retire into France,
where he joined the Queen and the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>IN Ireland, during these transactions, the authority of
the nuncio prevailed without control among all the ca∣tholics;
and that prelate, by his indiscretion and inso∣lence,
soon made them repent of the power, with which
they had entrusted him. Prudent men likewise were sen∣sible
of the total destruction, which was hanging over
the nation from the English parliament, and saw no re∣source
nor safety but in giving support to the declining
authority of the King. The Earl of Clanricarde, a
nobleman of very antient family, a person too of merit,
who had ever preserved his loyalty, was sensible of the
ruin which threatened his countrymen, and was resolved,
if possible, to prevent it. He secretly formed a combi∣nation
among the catholics; he entered into a corre∣spondence
with Inchiquin, who preserved great autho∣rity
over the protestants in Munster; he attacked the
nuncio, whom he chaced out of the island; and he sent
to Paris a deputation, inviting the Lord Lieutenant to
return and take possession of his government.</P>
<P>ORMOND on his arrival in Ireland found the king∣dom
divided into many factions, among whom either
open war or secret enmity prevailed. The authority of
the English parliament was established in Dublin, and
the other towns, which he himself had delivered into
<PB N="170" REF="232"/>
their hands. Oneale maintained his credit in Ulster;
and having entered into a secret correspondence with the
parliamentary generals, was more intent on schemes for
his own personal safety than anxious for the preservation
of his country or religion. The other Irish, divided be∣tween
their clergy, who were averse to Ormond, and
their nobility, who were attached to him, were very un∣certain
in their motions and feeble in their measures.
The Scots in the north, enraged, as well as their other
countrymen, against the usurpations of the sectarian
army, pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essed their adherence to the King; but were
still hindered by many prejudices from entering into a
cordial union with his Lieutenant. All these distracted
councils and contrary humors checked the progress of
Ormond, and enabled the parliamentary forces in Ireland
to maintain their ground against him. The English
army, while employed in subduing the revolted royalists,
in reducing the parliament to subjection, in the trial,
condemnation, and execution of their sovereign, totally
neglected the supply of Ireland, and allowed Jones and
the forces in Dublin to remain in the utmost weakness
and necessity. But the Lord Lieutenant, having at last,
with much difficulty, assembled an army of 16000 men,
advanced upon the English garrisons. Dundalk, where
Monk commanded, was delivered up by the garrison,
who mutinied against their governor. Tredah, Neury,
and other forts were taken. Dublin was threatened with
a siege; and the affairs of the Lord Lieutenant appeared
in so prosperous a condition, that the young King enter∣tained
thoughts of coming in person into Ireland.</P>
<P>WHEN the English commonwealth was brought to
some tolerable appearance of settlement, men began to
cast their eyes towards the neighbouring island. During
the contest of the two parties, the government of Ire∣land
had remained a great object of intrigue; and the
presbyterians endeavoured to obtain the lieutenancy for
<PB N="171" REF="233"/>
Waller, the independents for Lambert. After the exe∣cution
of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th March.</NOTE> Cromwel himself began to aspire
to a command, where so much glory, he saw, might be
won, and so much authority acquired. In his absence,
he took care to have his name proposed to the council of
state; and both friends and enemies concurred imme∣diately
to vote him into that important office: The for∣mer
suspected, that the matter had not been proposed
merely by chance, without his own concurrence; the
latter desired to remove him to a distance, and hoped,
during his absence, to gain the ascendant over Fairfax,
whom he had so long blinded by his hypocritical pro∣fessions.
Cromwel himself, when informed of his elec∣tion,
feigned surprize, and pretended at first to hesitate
with regard to the acceptance of the command. And
Lambert, either deceived by his dissimulation, or, in his
turn, feigning to be deceived, still continued, notwith∣standing
this disappointment, his friendship and con∣nexions
with Cromwel.</P>
<P>THE new Lieutenant immediately applied himself with
his wonted vigilance to make preparations for his expe∣dition.
Many disorders in England it behoved him pre∣viously
to compose. All places were full of danger and
inquietude. Tho' men, astonished with the successes of
the army, remained in seeming tranquillity, symptoms
of the highest discontent every where appeared. The
English, long accustomed to a mild government, and
unacquainted with dissimulation, could not conform their
speech and countenance to the present necessity, or pre∣tend
attachment to a form of government, which they
generally regarded with such violent abhorrence. It was
requisite to change the magistracy of London, and to de∣grade,
as well as punish, the mayor and some of the al∣dermen,
before the proclamation for the abolition of
Monarchy could be published in the city. An engage∣ment
being framed to support the Commonwealth with∣out
<PB N="172" REF="234"/>
King or House of Peers, the army were with some
difficulty brought to subscribe it, but tho' it was imposed
upon the rest of the nation under severe penalties, no
less than the putting all refusers out of the protection of
law; such obstinate reluctance was observed in the peo∣ple,
that even the imperious parliament were obliged to
desist from it. The spirit of fanaticism, by which that
assembly had at first been strongly supported, was now
turned, in a great measure, against them. The pulpits,
being chiefly filled with presbyterians, or disguised roya∣lists,
and having been long the scence of news and poli∣tics,
could by no penalties be restrained from declara∣tions,
unfavourable to the established government. Num∣berless
were the extravagances, which broke out among
the people. Everard, a disbanded soldier, having preached
that the time was now come when the community of
goods would be renewed among christians, led out his
followers to take possession of the land; and being car∣ried
before the general, he refused to salute him; be∣cause
he was but his fellow creature<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke.</NOTE>. What seemed
more dangerous: The army itself was infected with like
humors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The following instance of extravagance is given by Walker, in his History of Independency, part II. p. 152. About this time, there came six soldiers into the parish church of Walton upon Thames, near twilight; Mr. Faucet, the preacher there, not having till then ended his sermon. One of the sol∣diers had a lanthorn in his hand, and a candle burning in it, and in the other hand four candles not lighted. He desired the parishioners to stay awhile, saying he had a message from God unto them, and thereupon offered to go into the pulpit. But the people refusing to give him leave so to do, or to stay in the church, he went into the church-yard, and there told them, that he had a vision wherein he had received a command from God, to deliver his will unto them, which he was to deliver, and they to receive upon pain of damna∣tion; consisting of five lights. (1) “That the sabbath was abolished as un necessary, Jewish, and merely ceremonial. And here (quoth he) I shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put out the first light, but the wind is so high I cannot kindle it. (2) That tythes are abolishd as Jewish and ceremonial, a great burthen to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> “saints of God, and a discouragement of industry and tillage. And here I should put out my second light, &amp;c. (3.) That ministers are abolished as Antichristian, and of no longer use now Christ himself descends into the hearts of his saints, and his spirit enlighteneth them with revelations and inspirations. And here I should put out my third light, &amp;c. (4.) Ma∣gistrates are abolished as useless now that Christ himself is in purity amongst us, and hath erected the kingdom of the saints upon earth. Besides they are tyrants, and oppressors of the liberty of the saints, and tye them to laws and ordinances, mere human inventions: And here I should put out my fourth light, &amp;c. (5.) Then putting his hand into his pocket, and pulling out a little bible, he shewed it open to the people, saying, Here is a book you have in great veneration, consrsting of two parts, the old and new Testament: I must tell you it is abolished; it containeth beggarly rudi∣ments, milk for babes: But now Christ is in glory amongst us, and im∣parts a farther measure of his spirit to his saints than this can afford. I am commanded to burn it before your face. Then putting out the candle he said; and here my fifth light is extingurshed.” It became a pretty common doctrine at that time, that it was unworthy of a christian man to pay rent to his fellow creatures; and landlords were obliged to use all the penalties of law against their tenants, whose conscience was scrupulous.</NOTE>. Tho' the levellers had for a time been sup∣pressed
<PB N="173" REF="235"/>
by the audacious spirit of Cromwel, they still
continued to propagate their doctrines among the private
men and inferior officers, who pretended a right to be
consulted, as before, in the administration of the Com∣monwealth.
They now practised against their officers
the same lesson, which they had been taught against the
parliament. They framed a remonstrance, and sent five
agitators to present it to the general and council of war;
These were cashiered with ignominy by sentence of a
court martial. One Lockier, having carried his sedition
farther, was sentenced to death; but this punishment
was so far from quelling the mutinous spirit, that above
a thousand of his companions showed their adherence to
him, by attending his funeral, and wearing in their hats
black and sea-green ribbons by way of favours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levellers suppressed.</NOTE> About
four thousand assembled at Burford under the command
of Thomson, a man formerly condemned for sedition by
a court-martial, but pardoned by the general.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> Colonel
Reynolds, and afterwards Fairfax and Cromwel, fell
<PB N="174" REF="236"/>
upon them while unprepared for defence, and seduced
by the appearance of a treaty. Four hundred were
taken prisoners: Some of them capitally punished: The
rest pardoned: And this tumultuous spirit, tho' it still
lurked in the army, and broke out from time to time,
seemed for the present to be suppressed.</P>
<P>PETITIONS framed in the same spirit of opposition
were presented to the parliament by lieutenant-colonel
Liburn, the person who, for dispersing seditious pamph∣lets,
had formerly been treated with such severity by the
Star Chamber. His liberty was at this time as ill re∣lished
by the parliament, and he was thrown into prison,
as a promoter of sedition and disorder in the Common-wealth.
The women applied by petition for his release;
but were now desired to mind their houshold affairs, and
leave the government of the state to the men. From
all quarters, the parliament were harrassed with petitions
of a very free nature, which strongly spoke the sense of
the nation, and proved how ardently all men longed for
the resoration of their laws and liberties. Even in a
feast, which the city gave to the parliament and council
of state, it was esteemed a requisite precaution, if we
may credit Walker and Dugdale, to swear all the cooks,
that they would serve nothing but wholesome food to
them.</P>
<P>THE parliament judged it necessary to enlarge the
laws of high-treason beyond those narrow bounds, within
which they had been confined during the monarchy.
They even comprehended verbal offences, nay inten∣tions,
tho' they had never appeared in any overt-act
against the state. To affirm the present government to
be an usurpation, to assert that the parliament or council
of state were tyrannical or illegal, to endeavour the sub∣verting
their authority or stirring up sedition against
them; these offences were declared to be high-treason.
<PB N="175" REF="237"/>
The power of imprisonment, of which the petition of
right had bereaved the King, it was now found requisite
to restore to the council of state; and all the jails of
England were filled with men whom the jealousies and
fears of the ruling party had represented as dangerous<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">History of Independency, part II.</NOTE>.
The taxes continued by the new government, and which,
being unusual, were esteemed heavy, encreased the ge∣neral
ill will under which it labored. Besides the customs
and excise, ninety thousand pounds a month were levied
on land for the subsistence of the army. The sequestra∣tions
and compositions of the royalists, the sale of the
crown lands, and of the dean and chapter lands, tho'
they yielded immense sums, were not sufficient to sup∣ply
the vast expences, and, as was suspected, the great
depredations, of the parliament and of their creatures.</P>
<P>AMIDST all these difficulties and disturbances, the
fteddy mind of Cromwel, without confusion or embarrass∣ment,
still pursued its purpofe. While he was collect∣ing
an army of twelve thousand men in the west of Eng∣land,
he sent to Ireland under Reynolds and Venables, a
reinforcement of four thousand horse and foot, in order
to strengthen Jones, and enable him to defend himself
against the Marquess of Ormond, who lay at Finglass
and began to threaten Dublin. Inchiquin, with a sepa∣rate
body, having taken Tredah and Dundalk, gave a
defeat to Offarrell who served under Oneal, and to
young Coot who commanded some parliamentary forces
After he had joined his troops to the main army, with
whom, for some time, he remair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed united, Ormond
passed the river Liffy, and took post at Rathmines two
miles from Dublin, with a view of commencing the siege
of that city. In order to cut off all farther supply from
Jones, he had begun the reparation of an old fort, which
lay at the gates of Dublin; and being exhausted with
continual fatigue for some days, he had retired to rest,
<PB N="176" REF="238"/>
after leaving orders to keep his forces under arms. He
was suddenly awaked with the noise of firing; and start∣ing
from his bed, saw every thing already in tumult and
confusion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of August.</NOTE> Jones, an excellent officer, formerly a law∣yer,
had sallied out with the reinforcement newly ar∣rived;
and attacking the party employed in repairing the
fort, he totally routed them, pursued the advantage, and
fell in with the army, which had neglected Ormond's
orders. These he soon threw into disorder; put them
to flight, in spite of all the efforts of the Lord-Lieute∣nant;
chaced them off the field; seized all their tents,
baggage, ammunition; and returned victorious to Dublin,
after killing three thousand men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Dub∣lin raised.</NOTE> and taking above two
thousand prisoners.</P>
<P>THIS loss, which threw some blemish on the military
character of Ormond, was irreparable to the royal cause.
That numerous army, which, with so much pains and
difficulty, the Lord-Lieutenant had been collecting for
more than a year, was dispersed in a moment. Crom∣wel
soon after arrived in Dublin, where he was welcomed
with mighty shouts and rejoicings. He hastened imme∣diately
to Tredah. That town was well fortified; and
Ormond had thrown into it a good garrison of three
thousand men, under Sir Arthur Aston, an officer of re∣putation.
He expected that Tredah, lying in the neigh∣bourhood
of Dublin, would first be attempted by Crom∣wel,
and he was willing to employ the enemy some time
in that siege, while he himself should repair his broken
forces. But Cromwel knew the importance of dispath.
Having made a breach, he ordered a general assault.
Tho' twice repulsed with great loss,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September. Tredah stormed.</NOTE> he renewed the at∣tack,
and himself, along with Ireton, led on his men.
All opposition was overborne by the furious valour of the
troops. The town was taken sword in hand; and orders
being issued to give no quarter, a cruel slaughter was
made of the garrison. Even a few, who were saved by
<PB N="177" REF="239"/>
the soldiers, satiated with blood, were next day miserably
butchered by orders from the general. One person
alone of the whole garrison escaped to be a messenger of
this universal havock and destruction.</P>
<P>CROMWEL pretended by this severe execution to reta∣liate
the cruelty of the Irish massacre: But he well
knew, that almost the whole garrison was English; and
his justice was only a barbarous policy, in order to ter∣rify
all other garrisons from resistance. His policy, how∣ever,
had the desired effect. Having led the army with∣out
delay to Wexford, he began to batter the town.
The garrison after a slight defence offered to capitulate;
but before they obtained a cessation, they imprudently
neglected their guards; and the English army rushed in
upon them. The same severity was exercised as at
Tredah.</P>
<P>EVERY town, before which Cromwel presented him∣self,
now opened its gates without resistance. Ross,
tho' strongly garrisoned, was surrendered by Lord Taffe.
Having taken Estionage; Cromwel<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> threw a bridge over
the Barrow, and made himself master of Passage and
Carric. Owen Oneale submitted at discretion, and
soon afterwards died. The English had no difficulties
to encounter but what arose from fatigue and the ad∣vanced
season. Fluxes and contagious distempers crept
in among the soldiers, who perished in great numbers.
Jones himself, the brave governor of Dublin, died at
Wexford. And Cromwel had so far advanced with his
decayed army, that he began to find it difficult, either
to subsist in the enemies country, or retreat to his own
garrisons. But while he was in these straits, Corke,
Kinsale, and all the English garrisons in Munster de∣serted
to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> and opening their gates resolved to share
the fortunes of their victorious countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="240"/>
THIS desertion of the English put an end entirely to<NOTE PLACE="marg">1650.</NOTE>
Ormond's authority, which was already much diminished
by the misfortunes at Dublin, Tredah and Wexford.
The Irish, actuated by national and religious prejudices,
could no longer be kept in obedience by a protestant
governor, who was so unsuccessful in all his enterprizes.
The clergy renewed their excommunications against him
and his adherents, and added the terrors of superstition
to those arising from a victorious enemy. Cromwel
having received a reinforcement from England, again
took the field early in the spring. After a siege, he made himself master of Kilkenny, the only place where he
met with any vigorous resistance. The whole frame of
the Irish union being in a manner dissolved, Ormond,
soon after, left the island, and delegated his authority
to Clanricarde, who found affairs so desperate as to ad∣mit
of no remedy. The Irish were glad to embrace ba∣nishment
as a refuge. Above 40,000 men passed into
foreign service; and Cromwel, well-pleased to free the
island from enemies, who never could be cordially re∣conciled
to the English, gave them full liberty and lei∣sure
for their embarkation.</P>
<P>WHILE Cromwel proceeded with such uninterrupted
success in Ireland, which in the space of nine months
he had almost entirely subdued, fortune was preparing
for him a new scene of victory and triumph in Scotland.
Charles was at the Hague, when Sir Joseph Douglas
brought him intelligence, that he was proclaimed King
by the Scots parliment. At the same time, Douglas
informed him of the hard conditions annexed to the pro∣clamation,
and damped extremely that joy, which might
arise from his being recognized sovereign in one of his
kingdoms. Charles too confidered, that those who pre∣tended
to acknowlege his title, were at that very time
in actual rebellion against his family, and would be sure
<PB N="179" REF="241"/>
to intrust very little authority into his hands, and scarcely
would afford him personal liberty and security. As the
prospect of affairs in Ireland was at that time very pro∣mising,
he intended rather to try his fortune in that
kingdom, from which he expected more dutiful submis∣sion
and obedience.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE he found it expedient to depart from
Holland. The people in the United Provinces were
much attached to his interests. Besides his connexion
with the family of Orange, which was extremely be∣loved
by the populace, all men regarded with compas∣sion
his helpless condition, and expressed the greatest ab∣horrence
against the murder of his father; a deed, to
which nothing they thought, but the rage of fanaticism
and faction could have impelled the parliament. But
tho' the public in general bore a great favour to the
King, the States were uneasy at his presence. They
dreaded the parliament, so formidable by their power,
and so prosperous in all their enterprizes. They ap∣prehended
the most precipitant resolutions from men
of such violent and haughty dispostions. And after the
murder of Dorislaus, they found it still more necessary
to satisfy the English Commonwealth, by removing the
King at a distance from them.</P>
<P>DORISLAUS, tho' a native of Holland, had lived long
in England; and being employed as assistant to the
high court of justice, which condemned the King, he
had risen to great credit and favour with the ruling party.
They sent him envoy into Holland; but no sooner had
he arrived at the Hague, than he was set upon by some
royalists, chiefly retainers to Montrose. They rushed
into the room, where he was sitting with some compa∣ny;
dragg'd him from the table; put him to death as
the first victim to their murder'd sovereign; very leisurely
and peaceably separated themselves; and tho' orders
were istued by the magistrates to arrest them, these were
<PB N="180" REF="242"/>
executed with such slowness and reluctance, that the
criminals had, all of them, the opportunity to make
their escape.</P>
<P>CHARLES, having pass'd some time at Paris, where no
assistance was given him, and even few civilities were
paid him, made his retreat into Jersey, where his autho∣rity
was still acknowleged. Winram, laird of Liberton,
came to him as deputy from the committee of estates in
Scotland, and informed him of the conditions, to which
he must necessarily submit before he could be admitted
to the exercise of his authority. Conditions more se∣vere,
were never imposed by subjects upon their sove∣reign;
but as the affairs of Ireland began extremely to
decline, and the King found it no longer safe to ven∣ture
himself in that island, he gave a civil answer to
Winram, and desired commissioners to meet him at
Breda, in order to enter into a treaty with regard to
these conditions.</P>
<P>THE earls of Cassilis and Lothian, the lord Burley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covenanters.</NOTE>
the laird of Liberton and other commissioners arrived at
Breda; but without any power of treating: The King
must submit without reserve to the terms imposed upon
him. The terms were, That he should issue a procla∣mation,
banishing from court all excommunicated per∣sons,
that is, all those, who either under Hamilton or
Montrose, had ventured their lives for his family; that
no English subject, who had served against the par∣liament,
should be allowed to approach him; that
he should bind himself by his royal promise to take
the covenant; that he should ratify all acts of par∣liament,
by which presbyterian government, the di∣rectory
of worship, confession of faith and catechism
were enjoined; and that in civil affairs he should
govern himself entirely according to the direction of
parliament, and in ecclesiastical according to that of
the assembly. These proposals, the commissioners, after
<PB N="181" REF="243"/>
passing some time in sermons and prayers, in order to
express the more determined resolution, very solemnly
delivered to the King.</P>
<P>THE King's friends were extremely divided with re∣gard
to the part, which he should act in this critical
conjuncture. Most of his English counsellors dissuaded
him from accepting conditions, so disadvantageous and
dishonourable. They said, that the men, who now go∣verned
Scotland, were the most furious and bigotted of
that party, which, notwithstanding his gentle govern∣ment,
had first excited a rebellion against the late King;
after the most unlimited concessions, had renewed their
rebellion, and stopt the progress of his victories in Eng∣land;
and after he had entrusted his person with them in
his uttermost distress, had basely sold him, together with
their own honour, to his barbarous enemies: That they
had as yet shown no marks of repentance, and even in
the terms, which they now proposed, displayed the same
antimonarchical principles, and the same jealousy of
their Sovereign, by which they had ever been actuated:
That nothing could be more dishonourable, than that
the King, in his first enterprize, should sacrifice, merely
for the empty name of royalty, those principles, for
which his father had died a martyr, and in which he
himself had been strictly educated: That by this hypo∣crisy
he might lose the royalists, who alone were sin∣cerely
attached to him; but never would gain the presby∣terians,
who were averse to his family and his cause,
and would ascribe his compliance merely to policy and
necessity: That the Scots had refused to give him any
assurances of their intending to restore him to the throne
of England; and could they even be engaged to make
such an attempt, it had sufficiently appeared, by the
event of Hamilton's engagement, how unequal their
force was to so great an enterprize: That on the first
<PB N="180" REF="244"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="181" REF="245"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="182" REF="246"/>
check, which they should receive, Argyle and his par∣tizans
would lay hold of the quickest expedient for re∣conciling
themselves to the English parliament, and
would betray the King, as they had done his father, into
the hands of his enemies: And that, however desperate
the royal cause, it must still be regarded as highly im∣prudent
in the King to make a sacrifice of his honour;
where the sole purchase was to endanger his life or li∣berty.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Laneric, now Duke of Hamilton, the
Earl of Lauderdale, and others of that party, who had
been banished their country for the late engagement,
were then with the King; and being desirous of return∣ing
home in his retinue, they joined the opinion of the
young Duke of Buckingham, and very earnestly pressed
him to accept the conditions required of him. It was
urged, that nothing would more gratify the King's ene∣mies
than to see him fall into the snare laid for him, and
by so scrupulous a nicety leave the possession of his do∣minions
to those who desired but a pretence for exclud∣ing
him: That Argyle, not daring so far to oppose the
bent of the nation as to throw off all allegiance to his
sovereign, had embraced this expedient, by which he
hoped to make Charles dethrone himself, and refuse a
kingdom, which was offered him: That it was not to
be doubted but the same national spirit, assisted by Ha∣milton
and his party, would still rise higher in favour of
their Prince after he had intrusted himself to their fide∣lity,
and would much abate the rigor of the conditios,
now imposed upon him: That whatever might be the
present intentions of the ruling party, they must un∣avoidably
be engaged in a war with England, and must
accept the assistance of the King's friends of all parties,
in order to support themselves against a power, so much
superior: That however a steddy, uniform conduct
might have been suitable to the advanced age, and strict
<PB N="183" REF="247"/>
engagements of the late King, no one would throw any
blame on a young Prince for complying with conditions,
which necessity had extorted from him: That even the
rigour of those principles, professed by his father, tho'
with some it had exalted his character, had been ex∣tremely
prejudicial to his interest; nor could any thing
be more serviceable to the royal cause than to give all
parties room to hope for more equal and more indulgent
maxims of government: And that where affairs were
reduced to so desperate a situation, dangers ought little
to be regarded; and the King's honour lay rather in
showing some early symptoms of courage and activity,
than in choosing strictly a Party among theological con∣troversies,
with which, it might be supposed, he was,
as yet, very little acquainted.</P>
<P>THESE arguments, seconded by the advice of the
Queen and of the Prince of Orange, the King's brother
in law, who both of them esteemed it ridiculous to re∣fuse
a kingdom, merely from regard to episcopacy, had
great influence on Charles. But what chiefly determined
him to comply was the account brought him of the fate
of Montrose, who, with all the circumstances of rage
and contumely, had been put to death by his zealous
countrymen. Though in this instance the King saw
more evidently the furious spirit, by which the Scots
were actuated, he had now no farther resource, and was
obliged to grant whatever was demanded of him.</P>
<P>MONTROSE, having laid down his arms at the com∣mand
of the late King, had retired into France, and,
contrary to his natural disposition, lived for some time
inactive at Paris. He there became acquainted with the
famous Cardinal de Retz; and that penetrating judge
celebrates him in his memoirs as one of those heroes, of
whom there are no longer any remains in the world, and
who are only to be met with in Plutarch. Desirous of
improving his martial genius, he took a journey to Ger∣many,
<PB N="184" REF="248"/>
was caressed by the Emperor, received the rank
of Mareschal, and proposed to levy a regiment for the
Imperial service. While employed for that purpose in
the Low Countries, he heard of the tragical death of
the King; and at the same time received from his
young master a renewal of his commission of Captain
General in Scotland<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Clarendon.</NOTE>. His ardent and daring spirit
needed but this authority to put him in action. He ga∣thered
followers in Holland and the north of Germany,
whom his great reputation allured to him. The King
of Denmark and Duke of Holstein sent him some small
supplies of money: The Queen of Sweden furnished
him with arms: The Prince of Orange with ships:
And Montrose, hastening his enterprize, lest the King's
agreement with the Scots should make him revoke his
commission, set out for the Orkneys with about 500
men, most of them Germans. These were all the pre∣parations,
which he could make against a kingdom,
settled in domestic peace, supported by a disciplined
army, fully apprized of his enterprize, and prepared
against him. Some of his retainers having told him of a
prophesy, that <HI>to him and him alone it was reserved to re∣store
the King's authority in all his dominions;</HI> he lent a
willing ear to suggestions, which, however ill grounded
or improbable, were so conformable to his own magna∣nimous
disposition.</P>
<P>HE armed several of the inhabitants of the Orkneys,
though an unwarlike people, and carried them over with
him to Caithness; hoping, that the general affection to
the King's service, and the fame of his former exploits,
would make the Highlanders flock to his standard. But
all men were now harrassed and fatigued with wars and
disorders: Many of those, who formerly adhered to him,
had been severely punished by the covenanters: And no
prospect of success was entertained in opposition to so
<PB N="185" REF="249"/>
great a force as was drawn together against him. But
however weak Montrose's army, the memory of past
events struck a great terror into the committee of estates.
They immediately ordered Lesley and Holborne to march
against him with an army of 4000 men. Strahan was
sent before with a body of cavalry to check his progress.
He fell unexpectedly on Montrose, who had no horse to
bring him intelligence. The royalists were put to
flight; all of them either killed or taken prisoners; and
Montrose himself, having put on the disguise of a pea∣sant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montrose taken pri∣soner.</NOTE>
was perfidiously delivered into the hands of his
enemies, by a friend, to whom he had entrusted his
person.</P>
<P>ALL the insolence, which success can produce in un∣generous
minds, was exercised by the covenanters against
Montrose, whom they so much hated and so much
dreaded. Theological antipathy farther encreased their
indignities towards a person whom they regarded as exe∣crable
on account of the excommunication, which had
been pronounced against him. Lesley led him about for
several days in the same low habit, under which he had
disguised himself. The vulgar, wherever he passed, were
instigated to reproach and vilify him. When he came
to Edinburgh, every circumstance of elaborate rage and
insult was put in practice by order of the parliament.
At the eastern gate of the city, he was met by the ma∣gistrates,
and put into a new cart, purposely made with
a high chair or bench, where he was placed, that the
people might have a full view of him. He was bound
with a cord, drawn over his breast and shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, and
fastened through holes made in the cart. When in this
posture, the hangman took off the hat of the noble pri∣soner,
and rode himself before the cart in his livery, and
with his bonnet on; the other officers, who were taken
prisoners with the Marquess, walking two and two be∣fore
them.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="250"/>
THE populace, more generous and humane, when
they saw so mighty a change of fortune in this great
man, so lately their dread and terror, into whose hands
the magistrates, a few years before, had delivered on
their knees the keys of the city, were struck with com∣passion,
and viewed him with silent tears and admira∣tion.
The preachers, next Sunday, exclaimed against
these movements of rebel nature, as they expressed it:
and reproached the people with their profane tenderness
towards this capital enemy of all piety and religion.</P>
<P>WHEN he was carried before the parliament, which
was then fitting, Loudon, the chancellor, in a violent
declamation, reproached him with the breach of the na∣tional
covenant, which he had subscribed; his rebellion
against God, the King, and the kingdom; and the
many horrible murders, treasons, and impieties, for
which he was now to be brought to condign punish∣ment.
Montrose in his answer maintained the same
superiority above his enemies, to which, by his fame
and great actions, as well as by the conscience of a good
cause, he was justly entitled. He told the parliament,
that since the King, as he was informed, had so far
avowed their authority as to enter into treaty with them,
he now appeared uncovered before their tribunal; a re∣spect,
which, while they stood in open defiance to their
sovereign, they would in vain have required of him.
That he acknowledged with infinite shame and remorse
the errors of his early conduct, when their plausible pre∣tences
had seduced him to tread with them the paths of
rebellion, and bear arms against his prince and country.
That his following services, he hoped, had sufficiently
testified his repentance, and his death would now atone
for that guilt, the only one with which he could justly
reproach himself. That in all his warlike enterprizes
he was warranted by that commission, which he had re∣ceived
<PB N="187" REF="251"/>
from his and their master, against whose lawful
authority they had erected their standard. That to ven∣ture
his life for his sovereign was the least part of his
merit: He had even thrown down his arms in obedience
to the sacred commands of the King; and had resigned
to them the victory, which, in defiance of all their ef∣forts,
he was still enabled to dispute with them. That
no blood had ever been shed by him but in the field of
battle; and many persons were now in his eye, many
now dared to pronounce sentence of death upon him,
whose life, forfeited by the laws of war, he had formerly
saved from the fury of the soldiers. That he was sorry
to find no better testimony of their return to allegiance
than the murder of so faithful a subject, in whose death
the King's commission must be at once so highly in∣jured
and affronted. That as to himself they had in
vain endeavoured to vilify and degrade him by all their
studied indignities: The justice of his cause, he knew,
would enoble any fortune; nor had he other affliction
than to see the authority of his Prince, with which he
was invested, treated with so much ignominy. And
that he now joyfully followed, by a like unjust sentence,
his late sovereign; and should be happy, if, in his fu∣ture
destiny, he could follow him to the same blissful
mansions, where his piety and humane virtues had al∣ready,
without doubt, secured him an eternal recom∣pence.</P>
<P>MONTROSE'S sentence was next pronounced against
him, “That he, James Graham” (for this was the
only name they vouchsafed to give him) “should next
day be carried to Edinburgh cross, and there be
hanged on a gibbet, thirty foot high, for the space of
three hours: Then be taken down, his head be cut
off upon a scaffold, and affixed to the prison: His
legs and arms be stuck up on the four chief towns of
the kingdom: His body be buried in the place appro∣priated

<PB N="188" REF="254"/>
for common malefactors; except the church,
upon his repentance, should take off his excommuni∣cation.”</P>
<P>THE clergy, hoping, that the terrors of immediate
death had now given them an advantage over their ene∣my,
flocked about him, and insulted over his fallen for∣tunes.
They pronounced his damnation, and assured
him, that the judgment, which he was so soon to suf∣fer,
would prove but an easy prologue to that which he
must undergo hereafter. They next offered to pray with
him: But he was too well acquainted with those forms
of imprecation, which they called prayers. “Lord,
vouchsafe yet to touch the obdurate heart of this
proud incorrigible sinner; this wicked, perjured,
traiterous, and profane person, who refuses to hearken
to the voice of thy church.” Such were the petitions
which he expected they would, according to custom, of∣fer
up for him. He told them, that they were a miserable
deluded and deluding people; and would shortly bring
their country under the most insupportable servitude, to
which any nation had ever been reduced. “For my
part,” added he, “I am much prouder to have my
head affixed to the place, where it is sentenced to stand,
than to have my picture hang in the King's bed∣chamber.
So far from being sorry, that my legs and
arms are to be sent to four cities of the kingdom; I
wish I had limbs enough to be dispersed into all the
cities of Christendom, there to remain as testimonies
in favour of the cause, for which I suffer.” This
sentiment, that very evening, while in prison, he threw
into verse. The poem remains; a signal monument of
his heroic spirit, and no despicable proof of his poetical
genius.</P>
<P>NOW was led forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of May.</NOTE> amidst the insults of his enemies
and the tears of the people, the man of the most illustri∣ous
birth and greatest renown of the nation, to suffer,
<PB N="189" REF="255"/>
for his adherence to the laws of his country, and the
rights of his sovereign, the ignominious death destined
to the meanest malefactor. Every attempt, which the
insolence of the governing party had made to subdue his
gallant spirit, had hitherto proved fruitless: They made
yet one effort more, in this last and melancholy scene,
when all enmity, arising from motives merely human,
is commonly softened and disarmed. The executioner
brought that book, which had been published in elegant
Latin of his truly heroic actions, and tied it by a cord
about his neck. Montrose smiled at this new instance
of their malice. He thanked them, however, for their
officious zeal; and said, that he bore this testimony of
his bravery and loyalty with more pride than he had ever
worne the garter. Having asked, whether they had any
more indignities to put upon him, and renewing some
devout ejaculations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> he patiently endured the last act of
the executioner.</P>
<P>THUS perished, in the thirty-eighth year of his age,
the gallant marquess of Montrose; the man whose mili∣tary
genius, both by valour and conduct, had shone
forth beyond any, which, during these civil disorders,
had appeared in the three kingdoms. The finer arts too,
in his youth, he had successfully cultivated; and whatever
was sublime, elegant, or noble touched his great soul.
Nor was he insensible to the pleasures either of society
or of love. Something, however, of the <HI>vast and unbound∣ed</HI>
characterized all his actions and deportment; and it
was merely by an heroic effort of duty, that he brought
his mind, impatient of superiority, and even of equa∣lity,
to pay such unlimited submission to the will of his
sovereign.</P>
<P>THE vengeance of the covenanters was not satisfied
with Montrose's execution. Urrey, whose inconstancy
now led him to take part with the King, suffered about
<PB N="190" REF="256"/>
the same time: Spotiswood of Daersie, a youth of eigh∣teen,
Sir Francis Hay of Dalgetie, and Colonel Sib∣bald,
all of them men of birth and character, under∣went
a like fate. These were taken prisoners with
Montrose. The Marquess of Huntley, about a year
before, had also fallen a victim to the severity of the co∣venanters.</P>
<P>THE past scene displays in a full light the barbarity
of this theological faction: The sequel will sufficiently
discover their absurdities. The corruptions of the best
things produce the worst; and no wonder that the abus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
of religion should of all others be the most odious and
ridiculous. In order to convey a just notion of the ge∣nius
of the age, we are obliged sometimes in our narra∣tion
to make use of the same cant and expression, which
was then so prevalent.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of June.</NOTE> in consequence of his agreemeent with
the Scots commissioners, set sail for Scotland; and be∣ing
escorted by seven Dutch ships of war, who were
sent to guard the herring fishery, he arrived in the firth
of Cromarty. Before he was permitted to land, he was
required to sign the covenant; and many sermons and
lectures were made him, exhorting him to persevere in
that holy confederacy<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's Historical Discourses, p. 159.</NOTE>. Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covenanteers</NOTE> Lauderdale, Dum∣fermling,
and other noblemen of that faction whom
they called Engagers, were immediately separated
from him, and obliged to retire to their houses, where
they lived in a private manner, without trust or autho∣rity.
None of his English friends, who had served his
father, were allowed to remain in the kingdom. The
King himself found, that he was considered as a mere
pageant of state, and that the few remains of royalty,
which he possessed, served only to draw on him the
greater indignities. One of the quarters of Montrose,
his faithful servant, who had borne his commission, he
<PB N="191" REF="257"/>
found hanging at Aberdeen.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's Historical Discourses, p. 160.</NOTE> The general assembly,
and afterwards the committee of estates and the army,
who were entirely governed by the assembly, set forth a
public declaration, in which they protested, “that they
did not espouse any malignant quarrel or party, but
fought merely on their former grounds or principles;
that they disclaimed all the sins and guilt of the
King, and of his house; nor would they own him or
his interest, otherwise than with a subordination to
God, and so far as he owned and prosecuted the cause
of God, and acknowleged the sins of his house, and
of his former ways<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166, 167.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE King, lying entirely at mercy, and having no
assurance of liberty or life, farther than was agreeable to
the fancy of these austere zealots, was constrained to
embrace a measure, which nothing but the necessity of
his affairs, and his great youth and inexperince could
excuse. He issued a declaration, such as they required
of him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 170.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of Au∣gust.</NOTE> He there gave thanks for the merciful dispen∣sations
of providence, by which he was recovered out
of the snare of evil councils, had attained a full persua∣sion
of the righteousness of the covenant, and was in∣duced
to cast himself and his interest wholly upon God.
He desired to be deeply humbled and afflicted in spirit,
because of his father's following evil council, opposing
the covenant and the work of reformation, and shedding
the blood of God's people through all his dominions.
He lamented the idolatry of his mother and the tolera∣tion
of it in his father's house; a matter of great of∣fence,
he said, to all the protestant churches, and a
great provocation to him who is a jealous God, visiting
the sins of the father upon the children. He professed,
that he would have no enemies but the enemies of the
<PB N="192" REF="258"/>
covenant; and that he detested all popery, superstition,
prelacy, heresy, schism, and profaneness; and was re∣solved
not to tolerate, much less to countenance
any of them in any of his dominions. He declared,
that he would never love nor favour any who have
so little conscience as to follow his interests, in
preference to the gospel and the kingdom of Jesus
Christ. And he expressed his hope, that whatever ill
success his former guilt might have drawn upon his
cause, yet now, having obtained mercy to be on God's
side, and to acknowlege his own cause subordinate to
that of God, the divine providence would crown his
arms with victory.</P>
<P>STILL the covenanters and the clergy were diffident
of the King's sincerity. The facility, which he disco∣vered
in yielding to whatever was required of him, made
them suspect that he regarded all his concessions merely
as ridiculous farces, to which he must of necessity sub∣mit.
They had another trial prepared for him. In∣stead
of the solemnity of his coronation, which was de∣layed,
they were resolved, that he should pass through
a public humiliation, and do penance before the whole
people. They sent him twelve articles of repentance,
which he was to acknowlege; and the King had agreed,
that he would submit to this indignity. The various
transgressions of his father and grandfather, together
with the idolatry of his mother, are again enumerated
and aggravated in these articles; and farther declarations
were insisted on, that he sought the restitution of his
rights, for the sole advancement of religion, and in subor∣dination
to the kingdom of Christ<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's Historical Discourses, p. 178.</NOTE>. In short, having ex∣alted
the altar above the throne, and brought royalty under
their feet, the clergy were resolved to trample on it and
vilify it, by every instance of contumely, which their
<PB N="193" REF="259"/>
present influence enabled them to impose upon their un∣happy
prince.</P>
<P>CHARLES in the mean time found his authority en∣tirely
annihilated, as well as his character degraded. He
was consulted in no public measure. He was not called
to assist at any councils. His choice was sufficient to
discredit any pretender to office or advancement. All
efforts, which he made to unite the opposite parties, en∣creased
the suspicion, which the covenanters had enter∣tained
of him, as if he was not entirely their own. Ar∣gyle,
who by subtilties and compliances, partly led and
partly was governed by this wild faction, still turned a
deaf ear to all advances, which the King made to enter
into confidence with him. <HI>Malignants</HI> and <HI>Engagers</HI> con∣tinued
to be the objects of general hatred and persecu∣tion;
and whoever was disagreeable to the clergy failed
not to have one of these epithets affixed to him. The fa∣naticism,
which prevailed, being so full of sour and
angry principles, and so overcharged with various anti∣pathies,
had acquired a new object of abhorrence:
These were the <HI>Sorcerers.</HI> So prevalent was the opinion
of witchcraft, that great numbers, accused of that
crime, were burnt by sentence of the magistrates thro'
all parts of Scotland. In a village near Berwic, which
contained only fourteen houses, fourteen persons were
punished by fire<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>locke, p. 434. 408.</NOTE>; and it became a science every where
much studied and cultivated, to distinguish a true witch
by proper trials and symptoms<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 396. 418.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE advance of the English army under Cromwel
was not able to appease or soften the animosities among
the Scots parties. The clergy were still resolute to ex∣clude
all but their most zealous adherents. So soon as
the English parliament found that the treaty between
the King and the Scots would probably terminate in an
<PB N="194" REF="260"/>
accommodation, they made preparations for a war,
which, they saw, would, in the end, prove inevitable.
Cromwel having now broke the force and courage of the
Irish, was sent for; and he left the command of Ireland
to Ireton, who governed that kingdom in the character
of deputy, and with great vigilance and industry perse∣vered
in the work of subduing and expelling the na∣tives.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that Fairfax, who still retained the
name of General, would continue to act against Scot∣land,
and appear at the head of the armies; a station for
which he was well qualified, and where alone he made
any figure. But Fairfax, though he had allowed the
army to make use of his name in murdering their sove∣reign,
and offering violence to the parliament, had enter∣tained
unsurmountable scruples against invading the Scots,
whom he considered as zealous presbyterians, and u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted
to England by the sacred bands of the coven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. He
was farther disgusted at the extremities into which he
had already been hurried; and was confirmed in his re∣solution
by the exhortations of his wife, who had great
influence over him, and was herself much governed by
the presbyterian clergy. A committee of parliament
was sent to reason with him; and Cromwel was one of
the number. In vain did they urge, that the Scots had
first broke the covenant by their invasion of England
under Duke Hamilton; and that they would surely re∣new
their hostile attempts, if not prevented by the vi∣gorous
measures of the Commonwealth. Cromwel,
who knew the rigid inflexibility of Fairfax, in every
thing, which he regarded as matter of principle, ven∣tured
to solicit him with the utmost earnestness; and he
went so far as to shed tears of grief and vexation on this
occasion. No one could suspect any ambition in the
man, who laboured so zealously to retain his general in
that high office, which, he knew, he himself was alone
<PB N="195" REF="261"/>
entitled to fill. The same warmth of temper, which
made Cromwel a most frantic enthusiast, rendered him
the most dangerous of hypocrites; and it was to this
turn of mind, as much as to his courage and capacity,
that he owed all his wonderful successes. By the con∣tagious
ferment of his zeal, he engaged every one to co∣operate
with him in his measures; and entering easily
and affectionately into every part, which he was disposed
to act, he was enabled, even after multiplied deceits, to
cover, under a tempest of passion, all his crooked
schemes and profound artifices.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX having resigned his commission, it was be∣stowed
on Cromwel, who was declared captain-general
of all the forces in England. This command, in a
Commonwealth, which stood entirely by arms, was of
the utmost importance; and was the chief step, which
this ambitious politician had yet made towards sovereign
power. He immediately marched his forces, and entered
Scotland with an army of 16,000 men.</P>
<P>THE command of the Scots army was given to Lesley,
a good officer, who formed a very proper plan for de∣fence.
He entrenched himself in a fortified camp be∣tween
Edinburgh and Leith, and took care to remove
from the counties of Merse and the Lothians every thing
which could serve to support the English army. Crom∣wel
advanced to the Scots camp, and endeavoured, by
every expedient, to bring Lesley to a battle: The pru∣dent
Scotsman knew, that, tho' superior in numbers, his
army was much inferior in discipline and experience to
the English; and he kept himself carefully within his
entrenchments. By skirmishes and small rencounters he
tried to confirm the spirits of his soldiers; and he was
successful in these enterprizes. His army encreased daily
both in numbers and courage. The King came to the
camp; and having exerted himself in an action, gained
extremely on the affections of the soldiery, who were
<PB N="196" REF="262"/>
more desirous of serving under a young prince of spirit
and vivacity than under a committee of talking gown∣men.
The clergy were alarmed. They ordered the
King immediately to leave the camp. They also purged
it carefully of about 4000 <HI>Malignants</HI> and <HI>Engagers,</HI> whose
zeal had led them to attend the King, and who were the
soldiers of chief credit and experience in the nation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sir Ed. Walker, p. 165.</NOTE>.
They then concluded, that they had an army composed
entirely of saints, and could not be beaten. They mur∣mured
extremely, not only against their prudent general,
but also against the Lord, on account of his delays in
giving them deliverance<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d. p. 168</NOTE>; and they plainly told him,
that, if he would not save them from the English secta∣ries,
he should no longer be their God<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke p. 449.</NOTE>. An advant∣age
having offered itself on a Sunday, they hindred the
general from making use of it, lest he should involve the
nation in the guilt of sabbath-breaking.</P>
<P>CROMWEL found himself in a very bad situation. He
had no provisions but what he received by sea. He had
not had the precaution to bring these in sufficient quan∣tities;
and his army was reduced to difficulties. He re∣tired
to Dunbar. Lesley followed him and encamped on
the heights of Lammermure, which overlook that town.
There lay many difficult passes between Dunbar and
Berwic, and of these Lesley had taken possession. The
English general was brought to extremity. He had even
entertained a resolution of sending by sea all his foot and
artillery to England, and of breaking thro', at all ha∣zards,
with his cavalry. The madness of the Scots ec∣clesiastics
saved him from this loss and dishonour.</P>
<P>NIGHT and day the ministers had been wrestling with
the Lord in prayer, as they termed it; and they fancied,
that they had at last obtained the victory. Revelations,
they said, were made them, that the sectarian and here∣tical
<PB N="197" REF="263"/>
army, together with Agag, meaning Cromwel, was
delivered into their hands. Upon the faith of these vi∣sions,
they forced their general, in spite of all his re∣monstrances,
to descend into the plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Dunbar.</NOTE> with a view of
attacking the English in their retreat. Cromwel, look∣ing
thro' a perspective glass, saw the Scots camp in mo∣tion;
and foretold, without the help of revelations, that
the Lord had delivered his enemies into <HI>his</HI> hands. He
gave orders immediately for an attack.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> In this battle it
was easily observed, that nothing, in militar actions,
can supply the place of discipline and experience; and
that, in the presence of real danger, where men are not
accustomed to it, the fumes of enthusiasm presently dis∣sipate,
and lose their influence. The Scots, tho' doub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
in number to the English, were soon put to flight, and
pursued with great slaughter. The chief, if not only
resistance was made by one regiment of Highlanders,
that part of the army which was the least infected with
enthusiasm. No victory could be more compleat than this
obtained by Cromwel. About 3000 men were slain
and 9000 taken prisoners. Cromwel pursued his ad∣vantage,
and took possession of Edinburgh and Leith.
The remnants of the Scots army fled to Sterling. The
approach of the winter season, and an ague, which seized
Cromwel, kept him from pushing the victory any far∣ther.</P>
<P>THE clergy made great lamentations, and told the
Lord, that it was little to them to sacrifice their lives
and estates, but to him it was a great loss to suffer his
elect and chosen to be destroyed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker.</NOTE>. They published a
declaration, containing the cause of their late misfor∣tunes.
These visitations they afcribed to the manifold
provocations of the King's house, of which, they feared,
he had not yet thoroughly repented; the secret intru∣sion
<PB N="198" REF="264"/>
of malignants into the King's family and even into
the camp; the leaving of a most malignant and pro∣fane
guard of horse, who, being sent for to be purged,
came two days before the defeat, and were allowed to
fight in the army; the owning of the King's quarrel by
many without subordination to religion and liberty; and
the carnal self-seeking of some, together with the neglect
of family prayers in others.</P>
<P>CROMWEL having been so successful in the war of the
sword, took up the pen against the Scots ecclesiastics.
He wrote them some polemical letters, in which he main∣tained
the chief points of the independent theology. He
took care likewise to retort on them their favorite argu∣ment
of providence, and asked them whether the Lord had
not declared against them. But the ministers thought,
that the same events, which to their enemies were judge∣ments,
to them were but trials; and they replied, that
the Lord had only hid his face, for a time, from Jacob.
But Cromwel insisted, that the appeal had been made
to God in the most express and solemn manner, and
that in the fields of Dunbar an irrevocable decision had
been awarded in savour of the English army<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">This is the best of Cromwel's wretched compositions that remain, and we shall here extract a passage out of it. “You say you have not so learned Christ as to hang the equity of your cause upon events. We could wish that blindness had not been upon your eyes to all those marvellous dispen∣sations, which God hath wrought lately in England. But did not you so∣lemnly appeal and pray? Did not we do so too? And ought not we and you to think, with fear and trembling, of the hand of the great God, in this mighty and strange appearance of his, but can slightly call it an event? Were not both your and our expectations renewed from time to time, while we waited on God, to see which way he would manifest himself upon our appeals? And shall we, after all these our prayers, fastings, tears, expecta∣tions and solemn appeals, call these mere events? The Lord pity you. Surely we fear, because it has been a merciful and a gracious deliverance to us. I beseech you in the bowels of Christ, search after the mind of the Lord in it towards you, and we shall help you by our prayers that you may find it. For yet, if we know our heart at all, our bowels do in Christ yearn after the godly in Scotland.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="265"/>
THE defeat of the Scots was regarded by the King
as a very fortunate event.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1651.</NOTE> The armies, which fought
on both sides, were almost equally his enemies; and the
vanquished were now obliged to give him some more
authority, and apply to him for support. The parlia∣ment
was summoned to meet at St. Johnstone. Hamil∣ton,
Lauderdale, and all the Engagers were admitted into
court and camp, on condition of doing public pennance,
and expressing repentance for their late transgressions.
Some Malignants also crept in under various pretences.
The intended humiliation or pennance of the King was
changed into the ceremony of his coronation, which
was performed at Scone with great pomp and solemnity.
But amidst all this appearance of respect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ist of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> Charles re∣mained
in the hands of the most rigid Covenanters:
and tho' treated with civility and courtesy by Argyle,
a man of parts and address, he was little better than a
prisoner, and was still exposed to all the rudeness and
pedantry of the ecclesiastics.</P>
<P>THIS young prince was in a situation, which very ill
suited his temper and disposition. All those good qua∣lities
which he possessed, his affability, his wit, his
gaiety, his gentlemanly, disengaged behavior, were here
so many vices; and his love of ease, liberty, and plea∣sure
was regarded as the highest enormity. Tho' art∣ful
in the practice of courtly dissimulation, the sancti∣fied
style was utterly unknown to him; and he never
could mould his deportment into that starched grimace,
which the covenanters required as the infallible mark of
conversion. The duke of Buckingham was the only
English courtier allowed to attend him; and by his in∣genious
talent of ridicule, he had rendered himself ex∣tremely
<PB N="200" REF="266"/>
agreeable to his master. While so many ob∣jects
of derision surrounded them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1651.</NOTE> it was difficult to be
altogether insensible to the temptation, and wholly to
suppress the laugh. Obliged to attend from morning to
night at prayers and sermons, they betrayed evident symp∣toms
of weariness or contempt. The clergy never
could esteem the King sufficiently regenerated: And by
continued exhortations, remonstrances, and reprimands,
they still endeavoured to bring him to a juster sense of
his spiritual duty.</P>
<P>THE King's passion for the fair could not altogether
be restrained. He had once been observed using some
familiarities with a young woman; and a committee of
ministers was appointed to reprove him for a behaviour
so unbecoming a covenanted monarch. The spokesman
of the committee, one Douglass, began with a severe
aspect, informed the King that great scandal had been
given to the godly, enlarged on the heinous nature of
sin, and concluded with exhorting his Majesty, when∣ever
he was disposed to amuse himself, to be more care∣ful,
for the future, in shutting his windows. This
delicacy, so unusual to the place and to the character of
the man, was remarked by the King; and he never for∣got
the obligation.</P>
<P>THE King, shocked with all the indignities, and per∣haps,
still more tired with all the formalities, to which
he was obliged to submit, made an attempt to regain his
liberty. General Middleton, at the head of some roya∣lists,
being proscribed by the Covenanters, kept in the
mountains, expecting some opportunity of serving his
master. The King resolved to join this body. He se∣cretly
made his escape from Argyle, and fled towards
the Highlands. Colonel Montgomery, with a troop of
horse, was sent in pursuit of him. He overtook the
King, and persuaded him to return. The royalists be∣ing
<PB N="201" REF="267"/>
too weak to support him, Charles was the more ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly
induced to comply. This incident procured him after∣wards
better treatment and more authority; the cove∣nanters
being afraid of driving him by their rigours, to
some desperate resolution. Argyle renewed his courtship
to the King, and the King, with equal diffimulation,
pretended to repose great confidence in Argyle. He even
went so far as to drop hints of his intention to marry that
nobleman's daughter: But he had to do with a man too
wise to be seduced by such gross artifices.</P>
<P>SO soon as the season would permit, the Scots army
was assembled under Hamilton and Lesley; and the King
was allowed to join the camp. The forces of the western
counties, notwithstanding the imminent danger, which
threatened their country, were resolved not to unite their
cause with that of an army, which admitted any engagers
or malignants among them; and they kept in a body
apart under Ker. They called themselves the <HI>Protesters;</HI>
and their frantic clergy declaimed equally against the
King and Cromwel. The other party were denominated
<HI>Resolutioners;</HI> and these distinctions continued long after
to divide and agitate the kingdom.</P>
<P>CHARLES encamped at the Torwood; and his gene∣rals
resolved to conduct themselves by the same cautious
maxims, which, so long as they were embraced, had
been successful during the former campaign. The town
of Stirling lay at his back, and the whole north supplied
him with provisions. Strong entrenchments defended
his front; and it was in vain that Cromwel made every
attempt to bring him to an engagement. After losing
much time, the English general sent Lambert over the
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth into Fife, with an intention of cutting off the pro∣visions
of the Scots army. Lambert fell upon Holborne
and Brown, who commanded a party of the Scots, and
put them to rout with great slaughter. Cromwel also
<PB N="202" REF="268"/>
passed over with his whole army, and lying at the back
of the King, made it impossible for him to keep his post
any longer.</P>
<P>CHARLES, reduced to despair, embraced a resolution
worthy a young prince contending for empire. Having
the way open to England, he resolved immediately to
march into that country, where he expected, that all
his friends, and all those discontented with the present
government would flock to his standard. He persuaded
the generals to enter into the same views; and with one
consent the army, to the number of 14,000 men, rose
from their camp, and advanced by great journies towards
the south.</P>
<P>CROMWEL was surprized at the movements of the
Scots army. Wholly intent on offending his enemy, he
had exposed his friends to the most imminent danger,
and saw the King with a large army marching into Eng∣land,
where his presence, from the general hatred, which
prevailed against the parliament, was capable of operat∣ing
some great revolution. But if this conduct was an
oversight in Cromwel, he quickly repaired it by his vigi∣lance
and activity. He dispatched letters to the parlia∣ment,
exhorting them not to be terrified at the approach
of the Scots: He sent orders every where for assembling
forces to oppose the King: He ordered Lambert with a
body of cavalry to hang upon the rear of the royal
army, and infest their march: And he himself, leaving
Monk with 7000 men to compleat the reduction of
Scotland, followed the King with all the expedition pos∣sible.</P>
<P>CHARLES found himself disappointed in his expecta∣tions
of encreasing his army. The Scots, terrified at
the prospect of so hazardous an enterprize, fell off in
great numbers. The English presbyterians, having no
warning given them of the King's approach, were not
<PB N="203" REF="269"/>
prepared to join him. To the royalists, this measure
was equally unexpected; and they were farther de∣terred
from joining the Scots army by the orders which
the committee of ministers had issued, not to admit any,
even in this desperate extremity, who would not sub∣scribe
the covenant. The earl of Derby, leaving the
isle of Man, where he had hitherto maintained his inde∣pendance
on the parliament, was employed in levying
forces in Cheshire and Lancashire; but was soon sup∣pressed
by a party of the parliamentary army. And the
King, when he arrived at Worcester, found, that his
forces, extremely harrassed by a hasty and fatiguing
march, were not more numerous, than when he rose
from his camp in the Torwood.</P>
<P>SUCH is the influence of established government, that
the Commonwealth, tho' founded in usurpation the most
unjust and unpopular, had authority sufficient to raise
every where the militia of the counties; and these, united
with the regular forces, bent all their efforts against the
King. With an army of above 40,000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> Cromwel
fell upon Worcester; and attacking it on all sides, and
meeting with little resistance except from Duke Hamilton
and general Middleton, broke in upon the disordered
royalists. The streets of the city were strowed with
the dead. Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Worcester.</NOTE> a nobleman of great bravery and
honour, was mortally wounded; Massey wounded and
taken prisoner; the King himself, having given many
proofs of personal valour, was obliged to fly. The whole
Scots army were either killed or taken prisoners. The
country people, inflamed with national antipathy, inhu∣manly
put to death the few who escaped from the field of
battle.</P>
<P>THE King left Worcester at six o'clock in the after∣noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's escape.</NOTE>
and without halting, travelled about twenty-six
miles, in company with fifty or sixty of his friends. To
provide for his security, he thought it best to separate
<PB N="202" REF="270"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="203" REF="271"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="204" REF="272"/>
himself from his companions; and he left them without
communicating his intentions to any of them. By the
earl of Derby's directions, he went to Boscobel, a lone
house in the borders of Staffordshire, inhabited by one
Penderell, a farmer. To this man Charles entrusted
himself. The man had dignity of sentiments much
above his condition; and tho' death was denounced
against all who concealed the King, and a great reward
promised to any one who should betray him, he pro∣fessed
and maintained unshaken fidelity. He took the
assistance of his four brothers, equally honourable with
himself; and having cloathed the King in a garb like
their own, they led him into the neighbouring wood, put
a bill into his hand, and pretended to employ themselves
in cutting faggots. Some nights he lay upon straw in
the house, and fed upon such homely fare as it afforded.
For a better concealment, he mounted upon an oak,
where he sheltered himself among the leaves and branches
for twenty-four hours. He saw several soldiers pass by.
All of them were intent in search of the King; and many
expressed in his hearing their earnest wishes of seizing
him. This tree was afterwards denominated the <HI>Royal
Oak;</HI> and for many years was regarded by the whole
neighbourhood with great veneration.</P>
<P>CHARLES was in the middle of the kingdom, and
could neither stay in his retreat, nor stir a step from it,
without the most imminent danger. Fears, hopes, and
party-zeal interested multitudes to discover him; and
even the smallest indiscretion of his friends might prove
fatal. Having joined lord Wilmot, who was skulking
in the neighborhood, they agreed to put themselves into
the hands of colonel Lane, a zealous royalist, who
lived at Bentley, not many miles distant. The King's
feet were so hurt by walking about in heavy boots or
countrymen's shoes which did not fit him, that he was
obliged to mount on horseback; and he travelled in this
<PB N="205" REF="273"/>
situation to Bentley, attended by the five Penderells,
who had been so faithful to him. Lane formed a scheme
for his journey to Bristol, where, it was hoped, he would
find a ship, in which he might transport himself. He
had a near kinswoman, Mrs. Norton, who lived within
three miles of that city, and was with child, very near
the time of her delivery. He obtained a pass (for dur∣ing
those times of confusion this precaution was requi∣site)
for his sister Jane Lane and a servant, to travel to∣wards
Bristol, under pretence of visiting and attending
her relation. The King rode before the lady, and per∣sonated
the servant: Wilmot, carrying a hawk on his
hand, passed for a stranger, who had accidentally joined
them.</P>
<P>WHEN they arrived at Norton's, Mrs. Lane pretended,
that she had brought along as her servant, a poor lad, a
neighbouring farmer's son, who was ill of an ague; and
she begged a private room for him, where he might be
quiet. Tho' Charles kept himself retired in this cham∣ber,
the butler, one Pope, soon knew him; and throw∣ing
himself on his knees, prayed for his Majesty's life
and preservation. The King was alarmed, but made
the butler promise that he would keep the secret from
every mortal, even from his master; and he was faithful
to his engagement.</P>
<P>NO ship, it was found, would, for a month, set sail
from Bristol, either for France or Spain; and the King
was obliged to go elsewhere for a passage. He entrusted
himself to colonel Windham of Dorsetshire, an affec∣tionate
partizan of the royal family. The natural effect
of the long civil wars and of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious rage, to which
all men were wrought up in their different factions, was,
that every one's inclinations and affections were tho∣roughly
known, and even the courage and fidelity of most
men, by the variety of incidents, had been put to trial.
<PB N="206" REF="274"/>
The royalists too had, many of them, been obliged to
contrive concealments in their houses for themselves,
their friends, or most valuable effects; and the arts of
eluding the enemy had been often practised. All these
circumstances proved favourable to the King in the pre∣sent
exigency. As he passed often thro' the hands of
catholics, the <HI>Priest's hole,</HI> as they called it, the place,
where they were obliged to conceal their persecuted
priests, was sometimes employed for sheltering their dis∣tressed
Sovereign.</P>
<P>WINDHAM, before he received the King, asked leave
to entrust the important secret to his mother, his wife,
and four servants, on whose fidelity he could entirely de∣pend.
Of all these persons, no one proved wanting
either in honour or discretion. The venerable old ma∣tron,
on the reception of her royal guest, expressed the
utmost joy, that, having lost, without regret, three sons
and one grand-child in defence of his father, she was
now reserved, in her declining years, to be instrumental
in the preservation of himself. Windham told the King,
that Sir Thomas, his father, in the year 1636, a few
days before his death, called to him his five sons. “My
children,” said he, “we have hitherto seen serene
and quiet times under our three last sovereigns: But
I must now warn you to prepare for clouds and
storms. Factions arise on every side and threaten the
tranquillity of your native country. But whatever
happen, do you faithfully honour and obey your Prince,
and adhere to the Crown. I charge you never to for∣sake
the Crown, tho' it should hang upon a bush.”
“These last words,” added Windham, “made such
impressions on all our breasts, that the many af∣flictions
of these sad times could never efface their in∣delible
characters.” From innumerable instances it
appears how deep rooted in the minds of the English
gentry of that age was the principle of loyalty to their
<PB N="207" REF="275"/>
Sovereign; that noble and generous principle, inferior
only in excellence to the more enlarged and more in∣lightened
affection towards a legal constitution. But
during those times of military usurpation, these passions
were the same.</P>
<P>THE King continued nineteen days in Windham's
house; and all his friends in Britain and in every part
of Europe, remained in the most anxious suspence with
regard to his fortune: No one could conjecture whether
he was dead or alive; and the report of his death, being
generally believed, happily relaxed the vigilant search of
his enemies. Trials were made to procure a vessel for
his escape; but he still met with disappointments.
Having left Windham's house, he was obliged again to
return to it. He passed thro' many other adventures;
assumed different disguises; in every step was exposed to
imminent perils; and received daily proofs of uncor∣rupted
fidelity and attachment. The sagacity of a smith,
who remarked, that his horse's shoes had been made in
the north, not in the west, as he pretended, once de∣tected
him; and he narrowly escaped. At Shoreham in
Sussex a vessel was at last found, in which he embarked.
He had been known to so many, that, if he had not set
sail in that critical moment, it had been impossible for
him to escape. After one and forty days concealment,

<P>THE battle of Worcester afforded Cromwel what he
called his <HI>crowning mercy.</HI> So elated was he, that he in∣tended
to have knighted in the field two of his generals,
Lambert and Fleetwood; but was disswaded by his
friends from exerting this act of regal authority. His
power and ambition were too great to brook subjection
<PB N="208" REF="276"/>
to the empty name of a republic, which stood chiefly by
his influence and was supported by his victories. How
early he entertained thoughts of taking into his hand the
reins of government is uncertain. We are only assured,
that he now discovered to his intimate friends these
aspiring views; and even expressed a desire of assuming
the rank of King, which he had contributed, with such
seeming zeal, to abolish<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 523.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE little popularity and credit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣monwealth.</NOTE> acquired by the re∣publicans,
farther stimulated the ambition of this enter∣prizing
politician. These men had not that large
thought, nor those comprehensive views, which might
qualify them for acting the part of legislators: Selfish
aims and bigotry chiefly engrossed their attention. They
carried their rigid austerity so far as to enact laws, de∣claring
fornication, after the first act, to be felony, with∣out
benefit of clergy<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Scobel, p. 121.</NOTE>. They made small progress in
that important work, which they professed to have so
much at heart, the settling a new model of representa∣tion,
and fixing a plan of government. The nation be∣gan
to apprehend, that they intended to establish them∣selves
as a perpetual legislature, and to confine the whole
power to 60 or 70 persons, who called themselves the
parliament of the Commonwealth of England. And
while they pretended to bestow new liberties upon the
nation, they found themselves obliged to infringe even
the most valuable of those, which, thro' time immemo∣rial,
had been transmitted from their ancestors. Not
daring to entrust the trials of treason to juries, who, be∣ing
chosen indifferently from among the people, would
have been little favourable to the Commonwealth, and
would have formed their verdict upon the antient laws,
they eluded that noble institution, by which the govern∣ment
of this island has ever been so much distinguished.
<PB N="209" REF="277"/>
They had seen evidently in the trial of Lilburn what
they could expect from juries. This man, the most
turbulent, but the most upright and courageous of hu∣mankind,
was tried for a transgression of the new sta∣tute
of treasons: But tho' he was plainly guilty, he was
acquitted, to the infinite joy of the people. Westmin∣ster-hall,
nay the whole city, rang with shouts and ac∣clamations.
Never did any established power receive so
strong a declaration of its usurpation and invalidity;
and from no other institution, besides the admirable one
of juries, could be expected this magnanimous effort.</P>
<P>THAT they might not for the future be exposed to
affronts, which so much lessened their authority, the
parliament erected a high court of justice, who were to
receive indictments from the council of state. This
court was composed entirely of men, devoted to the
ruling party, without name or character, determin∣ed
to sacrifice every thing to their own safety or ambi∣tion.
Colonel Eusebius Andrews, and colonel Walter
Slingsby were tried by this court for conspiracies, and
condemned to death. They were royalists, and refused
to plead before so illegal a jurisdiction. Love, Gib∣bons,
and other presbyterians, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>having entered into a
plot against the republic, were also tried and executed.
The Earl of Derby, Sir Timothy Fetherstone, Bemboe,
being taken prisoners after the battle of Worcester, were
put to death by sentence of a court martial: A method
of proceeding declared unlawful by that very petition of
right, for which a former parliament had so strenuously
contended, and which, after great efforts, they had ex∣torted
from the King.</P>
<P>EXCEPTING their principles of toleration, the maxims,
by which the republicans regulated ecclesiastical affairs,
no more prognosticated any durable settlement, than
those by which they conducted their civil concerns. The
presbyterian model of congregations, classes, and as∣semblies

<PB N="209" REF="279"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="210" REF="280"/>
was not allowed to be finished: It seemed even
the intention of many leaders in the parliament to admit
of no established church, and to leave every one, with∣out
any guidance of the magistrate, to embrace what∣ever
sect and to support whatever clergy were most
agreeable to him. It was not perceived, that by this
policy the enthusiastic spirit must of necessity, from a
concurrence of the emulation and interested views of the
ecclesiastics, be raised to such a height as to elude all the
tyes of civil and moral duty.</P>
<P>THE parliament went so far as to make some ap∣proaches,
in one province, to their independant model.
Almost all the clergy of Wales being ejected as malig∣nants,
itinerant preachers with a small salary were set∣tled,
not above four or five in each county; and these,
being furnished with horses at the public charge, hur∣ried
from place to place, and carried, as they expressed
themselves, the glad tidings of the gospel<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Walker's attempt, p. 147, &amp; seq.</NOTE>. They were
all of them men of the lowest birth and education, who
had deserted mechanical trades, in order to follow this
new profession: And in this particular, as well as in
their wandering life, they pretended to be more truly
apostolical.</P>
<P>THE republicans, both by the turn of their disposition,
and by the nature of the instruments, which they em∣ployed,
were better qualified for acts of force and vi∣gour
than for the slow and deliberate work of legislation.
Notwithstanding the late wars and bloodshed and the
present factions, the power of England had never, in
any period, been so formidable to the neighbouring
kingdoms as at this time it appeared in the hands of the
Commonwealth. A numerous army served equally to
retain every one, in implicit subjection to established au∣thority,
and to strike a terror into foreign nations. The
<PB N="211" REF="281"/>
power of peace and war was lodged in the same hands
with that of imposing taxes; and no difference of views,
among the several members of the legislature, could any
longer be apprehended. The present impositions, tho'
much superior to what had ever formerly been expe∣rienced,
were in reality very moderate, and what a na∣tion,
so opulent, could easily bear. The military ge∣nius
of the people, by the civil contests, had been
rouzed from its former lethargy; and excellent officers
were formed in every branch of service. The confu∣sion,
into which all things had been thrown, had given
opportunity to men of low stations to break thro' their
obscurity, and to raise themselves by their courage to
commands, which they were well qualified to exercise,
but to which their birth could never have entitled them.
And while so great power was lodged in such active
hands, no wonder the republic was successful in all its
enterprizes.</P>
<P>BLAKE, a man of heroic courage and a generous dis∣position,
the same person who had defended Lyme and
Taunton with such unshaken obstinacy against the King,
was made an admiral; and tho' he had hitherto been ac∣customed
only to land service, into which too he had
not entered till past fifty years of age, he soon raised
the naval glory of the nation to a higher pitch than it
had ever attained in any former period. A fleet was
committed to him, and he received orders to pursue
Prince Rupert, to whom the King had given the com∣mand
of that squadron, which had deserted to him.
Rupert took shelter in Kinsale; and escaping thence,
fled towards the coast of Portugal. Blake pursued, and
chaced him into the Tagus, where he intended to at∣tack
that Prince. But the King of Portugal, moved by
the favour, which, throughout all Europe, attended the
royal cause, refused Blake admittance, and aided Prince
Rupert in making his escape. To be revenged of this
<PB N="212" REF="282"/>
partiality, the English admiral made prize of twenty
Portuguese ships richly laden, and threatened still far∣ther
vengeance. The King of Portugal, dreading so
dangerous a foe to his new acquired dominion, and
sensible of the unequal contest, in which he was en∣gaged,
made all possible submissions to the haughty re∣public,
and was at last admitted to negotiate the renewal
of his alliance with England. Prince Rupert, having
lost a great part of his squadron on the coast of Spain,
made sail towards the West-Indies. His brother, Prince
Maurice, was there ship-wrecked in a hurricane. Every
where, this squadron subsisted by privateering, some∣times
on English, sometimes on Spanish vessels. And
Rupert at last returned to France, where he disposed of
the remnants of his fleet, together with all his prizes.</P>
<P>ALL the settlements in America, except New Eng∣land,
which had been planted entirely by the puritans,
adhered to the royal party, even after the settlement of
the republic; and Sir George Ayscue was sent with a
squadron to reduce them to obedience. Bermudas, An∣tigua,
Virginia were soon subdued. Barbadoes, com∣manded
by Lord Willoughby of Parham, made some
resistance; but was at last obliged to submit.</P>
<P>WITH equal ease were Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly, and
the Isle of Man brought under subjection to the repub∣lic;
and the sea, which had been much infested by pri∣vateers
from these islands, was rendered entirely safe to
the English commerce. The Countess of Derby de∣fended
the Isle of Man; and with great reluctance yielded
to the necessity of surrendering to the enemy. This
lady, a daughter of the illustrious house of Trimo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uUille
in France, had, during the civil wars, displayed a manly
courage by her obstinate defence of Latham-House against
the parliamentary forces; and she retained the glory of be∣ing
the last person in the three kingdoms and in all their
<PB N="213" REF="283"/>
dependant dominions, who submitted to the victorious
Commonwealth<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">When the Earl of Derby was alive, he had been summoned by Ireton to surrender the Isle of Man; and he return'd this spirited and memorable an∣swer. “I receiv'd your letter with indignation, and with scorn return you this answer; that I cannot but wonder whence you should gather any hopes, that I should prove like you, treacherous to my sovereign; since you cannot be ignorant of my former actings in his late Majesty's service, from which principles of loyalty I am no whit departed. I scorn your proffers; I disdain your favour; I abhor your treason; and am so far from delivering up this island to your advantage, that I shall keep it to the ut∣most of my power to your destruction. Take this for your final answer, and forbear any farther sollicitations: for if you trouble me with any more messages of this nature, I will burn the paper and hang up the bearer. This is the immutable resolution, and shall be the undoubted practice of him, who accounts it his chiesest glory to be his Majesty's most loyal and obedient subject,”</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IRELAND and Scotland were now entirely subjected
and reduced to tranquillity. Ireton, the new deputy of
Ireland, commanding a numerous army of 30,000 men
prosecuted the work of subduing the revolted Irish;
and he defeated them in many rencounters, which,
tho' in themselves of no great moment, proved fatal to
their declining cause. He punished without mercy all
the prisoners who had any hand in the massacres. Sir
Phelim Oneale, among the rest, was, some time after∣wards,
brought to the gibbet, and suffered an ignomi∣nious
death, which he had so well merited by his inhu∣man
cruelties. Limeric, a confiderable town, still re∣mained
in the hands of the Irish; and Ireton, after a vi∣gorous
siege, made himself master of it. He was here
infected with the plague, and shortly after died; a very
memorable personage, much celebrated for his vigilance,
industry, capacity, even for the strict execution of justice
in that unlimited command, which he possessed in Ire∣land.
He was observed to be inflexible in all his pur∣poses;
and it was believed by many, that he was ani∣mated

<PB N="214" REF="286"/>
with a sincere and passionate love for liberty, and
never could have been induced, by any motive, to sub∣mit
to the smallest appearance of regal government.
Cromwel appeared to be much affected by his death;
and the Republicans, who reposed great confidence in
him, were inconsoleable. To show their regard for his
merit and services, they bestowed an estate of two thou∣sand
pounds a year on his family, and honoured him
with a magnificent funeral at the public charge. Tho'
the established government was but the mere shadow of
a Commonwealth, yet was it beginning by proper arts
to encourage that public spirit, which no other species
of civil polity is ever able fully to inspire.</P>
<P>THE command of the army in Ireland devolved on
lieutenant-general Ludlow. The civil government of
the island was entrusted to commissioners. Ludlow con∣tinued
to push the advantages against the Irish, and
every where obtained an easy victory. That unhappy
people, disgusted with the King on account of those
violent declarations against them and their religion,
which had been extorted by the Scots, applied to the
King of Spain, to the Duke of Lorraine; and found
assistance no where. Clanricarde, unable to resist the
prevailing power, made submissions to the parliament,
and retired into England, where he soon after died. He
was a steady catholic; but a man much respected by all
parties.</P>
<P>THE successes, which attended Monk in Scotland,
were no less decisive. That able general laid siege to
Stirling castle; and though it was well provided for de∣fence,
it was soon surrendered to him. He there be∣came
master of all the records of the kingdom; and he
sent them to England. The Earl of Leven, the Earl
of Crawford, Lord Ogilvy, and other noblemen, hav∣ing
met near Perth, in order to concert means for rais∣ing
a new army, were suddenly set upon by Colonel
<PB N="215" REF="287"/>
Alured, and most of them taken prisoners. Sir Philip
Musgrave, with some Scots, being engaged at Dumfries
in a like enterprize, met with the same fate. Dundee
was a town well fortified, supplied with a good garrison
under Lumisden, and full of all the rich furniture, the
plate and money of the kingdom, which had been sent
thither as to a place of safety. Monk appeared before
it; and having made a breach, gave a general assault.
He carried the town; and following the example and
instructions of Cromwel, put the whole inhabitants to
the sword, in order to strike a general terror into the
kingdom. Warned by this example, Aberdeen, St. An∣drews,
Inverness, and other towns and forts, of their
own accord, yielded to the enemy. Argyle made his
submissions to the English Commonwealth; and except∣ing
a few royalists, who remained some time in the
mountains, under the Earl of Glencairn, Lord Balcar∣ras,
and General Middleton, that kingdom, which had
hitherto, through all ages, by means of its situation, po∣verty,
and valour, maintained its independance, was re∣duced
to a total subjection.</P>
<P>THE English parliament sent Sir Harry Vane, St.
John, and other commissioners to settle Scotland. These
men, who possessed little of the real spirit of liberty,
knew how to maintain all the appearances of it; and
they required the voluntary consent of all the counties
and towns of this conquered kingdom, before they would
unite them into the same Commonwealth with England.
The clergy protested; because, they said, this incorpo∣ration
would draw along with it a subordination of the
church to the state in the things of Christ<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 496.</NOTE>. English
judges, joined to some Scots, were appointed to deter∣mine
all causes; justice was strictly executed; order and
peace maintained; and the Scots being freed from the
tyranny of the ecclesiastics, were not much dissatisfied
<PB N="216" REF="288"/>
with the present government<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It had been an usual policy of the presbyterian ecclesiastics to settle a chaplain in the great families, who acted as a spy upon his master, and gave them intelligence of the most private transactions and discourses of the family. A signal instance of priestly tyranny, and the subjection of the nobility! They even obliged the servants to give intelligence against their masters. Whitlocke, p. 502. The same author, p. 512. tells the following story. The synod meeting at Perth, and citing the ministers and people, who had expressed a dislike of <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir beavenly government,</HI> the men being out of the way, their wives resolved to answer for them. And on the day of appearance, 120 wo∣men with good clubs in their hands came and besieged the church, where the reverend ministers fat. They sent one of their number to treat with the fe∣males, and he threatening excommunication, they basted him for his labour, kept him prisoner, and sent a party of 60, who routed the rest of the clergy, bruised their bodies sorely, took all their baggage and 12 horses. One of the ministers, after a mile's-running, taking all creatures for his foes, meeting with a soldier fell on his knees, who knowing nothing of the matter asked the blackcoat what he meant. The female eonquerors, having laid hold on the synod clerk, beat him till he forswore his office. Thirteen ministers rallied about four miles from the place, and voted that this village should never morê have a synod in it, but be accursed; and that though in the years 1638 and 39, the godly women were cried up for stoning the bishops, yet now the whole sex should be esteemed wicked.</NOTE>. The prudent conduct
of Monk, a man who possessed a good capacity for the
arts both of peace and war, served much to reconcile the
minds of men, and to allay their prejudices.</P>
<P>By the total reduction and pacification of the British.
dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch war.</NOTE> the parliament had leisure to look abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1652.</NOTE>
and to exert their vigour in foreign enterprizes. The
Dutch were the first who felt the weight of their arms.</P>
<P>DURING the life of Frederic Hnery, Prince of Orange,
the states had maintained an exact neutrality in the civil
wars of England, and had never interposed, except by
their good offices, between the contending parties. When
William, who had married an English princess, suc∣ceeded
to his father's commands and authority, the
States, both before and after the execution of the late
King, were accused of taking steps more favourable to
<PB N="217" REF="289"/>
the royal cause, and of betraying a great prejudice against
the cause of the parliament. It was long before the en∣voy
of the English Commonwealth could obtain an au∣dience
of the States General. The murderers of Do∣rislaus
were not pursued with such vigour as the parlia∣ment
expected. And much regard had been payed the
King, and many good offices performed to him, both
by the public, and by men of all ranks, in the United
Provinces.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of William, Prince of Orange<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In October 17, 1650.</NOTE>,
which was attended with the depression of his party and
the triumph of the Republicans, the parliament thought,
that the time was now come of cementing a closer con∣federacy
with the United Provinces. St. John, Lord
Chief Justice, who was sent over to the Hague, had
entertained the idea of forming a kind of coalition be∣tween
the two Republics, which would have rendered
their interests totally inseparable; but fearing that so
extraordinary a project would not be relished, he con∣tented
himself with dropping some hints of it, and openly
went no farther than to propose a strict defensive al∣liance
between England and the States, such as has now,
for near seventy years, taken place between these
friendly powers<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>82.</NOTE>. But the States, who were unwilling
to form a nearer confederacy with a government,
whose measures were so obnoxious, and whose situation
seemed so precarious, offered only to renew the former
alliances with England. And the haughty St. John, dis∣gusted
with this refusal, as well as incensed at many af∣fronts,
which had been offered him with impunity, by
the retainers of the Palatine and Orange families, and
indeed by the populace in general, returned into Eng∣land,
and endeavoured to excite a quarrel between the
two republics.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="290"/>
THE movements of great states are often directed by
as slender springs as those of individuals. Though war
with so considerable a naval power as the Dutch, who
were in peace with all their other neighbours, might seem
dangerous to the yet unsettled Commonwealth, there
were several motives, which at this time induced the
English parliament to embrace hostile measures. Many
of the members thought, that a foreign war would serve
as a pretence for continuing the same parliament, and de∣laying
the new model of a representative, with which the
nation had so long been flattered. Others hoped, that the
war would furnish a reason for maintaining, some time
longer, that numerous mercenary army, which was so
much complained of<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">We are told in the life of Sir Harry Vane, that that famous Republican opposed the Dutch war, and that it was the military gentlemen chiefly who supported that measure.</NOTE>. On the other hand, some, who
dreaded the encreasing power of Cromwel, expected,
that the great expence of naval armaments would prove
a motive for diminishing the military establishment. To
divert the attention of the public from domestic quarrels
towards foreign transactions, seemed in the present dis∣position
of men's minds to be good policy. The supe∣rior
power of the English Commonwealth, together
with the advantages of situation, promised it success;
and the parliamentary leaders hoped to gain many rich
prizes from the Dutch, to distress and sink their flourish∣ing
commerce, and by victories to throw a lustre on
their establishment, which was so new and unpopular.
All these views, enforced by the violent spirit of St.
John, who had a great influence over Cromwel, deter∣mined
the parliament to change the proposed alliance
into a furious war against the United Provinces.</P>
<P>TO cover these hostile intentions, the parliament,
under pretence of providing for the interests of com∣merce,
embraced such measures as, they knew, would
<PB N="219" REF="291"/>
give disgust to the States. They framed the famous act
of navigation; which prohibited all nations to import
into England in their bottoms any commodity, which
was not the growth and manufacture of their own coun∣try.
By this law, though the terms, in which it was
conceived, were general, the Dutch were principally
hurt; because their country produces few commodities,
and they subsist chiefly by being the general carriers and
factors of the world. Letters of reprizal were granted
to several merchants, who complained of injuries, which,
as they pretended, they had received from the States;
and above eighty Dutch ships fell into their hands, and
were made prize of. The cruelties practised on the
English at Amboyna, which were certainly enormous,
but which seemed to be buried in oblivion by a thirty
years silence, were again made the grounds of com∣plaint.
And the allowing the murderers of Dorislaus to
escape, and the conniving at the insults to which St.
John had been exposed, were represented as symptoms
of an unfriendly, if not a hostile, disposition in the
States.</P>
<P>THE States, alarmed at all these steps, sent over or∣ders
to their ambassadors to endeavour the renewal of
the treaty of alliance, which had been broke off by the
abrupt departure of St. John. Not to be unprepared,
they equipped a fleet of a hundred and fifty fail, and
took care, by their ministers at London, to inform the
council of state of that armament. This intelligence,
instead of striking terror into the English republic, was
considered as a menace, and farther confirmed the par∣liament
in their hostile resolutions. The minds of men,
in both states, were every day more and more irritated
against each other; and it was not long before these
malignant humours broke forth into action.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="292"/>
TROMP, an admiral of great renown, received from
the States the command of a fleet of forty-two sail, in
order to protect the Dutch navigation against the priva∣teers
of the English. He was forced by stress of wea∣ther,
as he alledged, to take shelter in the road of
Dover, where he met with Blake, who commanded an
English fleet much inferior in number. Who was the
aggressor in the action, which ensued between these two
admirals, both of them men of such prompt and fiery
dispositions, it is not easy to determine; since each of
them sent to his own state a relation totally opposite in
all its circumstances to that of the other, and yet sup∣ported
by the testimony of every captain in his fleet.
Blake pretended, that, having given a signal to the
Dutch admiral to strike, Tromp, instead of complying,
fired a broad-side at him. Tromp asserted, that he was
preparing to strike, and that the English admiral, never∣theless,
began hostilities. It is certain, that the admi∣ralty
of Holland, who are distinct from the council of
state, had given Tromp no orders to strike, but had lest
him to his own discretion with regard to that vain, but
much contested ceremonial. They seemed willing to
introduce the claim of an equality with the new Com∣monwealth,
and to interpret the former respect, which
they had ever payed the English flag, as a deference due
only to the Monarchy. This circumstance forms a
strong presumption against the narrative of the Dutch
admiral. The whole Orange party, it must be remark∣ed,
to which Tromp was suspected to adhere, were de∣firous
of a war with England.</P>
<P>BLAKE, though his squadron consisted only of fifteen
vessels, re-inforced, after the battle began, by eight un∣der
captain Bourne, maintained the fight with great
bravery for five hours, and sunk one ship of the enemy,
and took another. Night parted the combatants, and
the Dutch fleet retired towards the coast of Holland.
<PB N="221" REF="293"/>
The populace of London were enraged, and would have
insulted the Dutch ambassadors, who lived at Chelsea,
had not the council of state sent guards to protect
them.</P>
<P>WHEN the States heard of this action, of which the
fatal consequences were easily foreseen, they were in the
utmost consternation. They immediately dispatched Paw,
pensionary of Holland, as their ambassador extraordinary
to London, and ordered him to lay before the parliament
the narrative which Tromp had sent of the late rencoun∣ter.
They entreated them, by all the bands of their
common religion, and common liberties, not to preci∣pitate
themselves into hostile measures, but to appoint
commissioners, who should examine every circumstance
of the action, and clear up the truth, which lay in ob∣scurity.
And they pretended, that they had given no
orders to their admiral to offer any violence to the Eng∣lish,
but would severely punish him, if they found upon
enquiry, that he had been guilty of an action, which
they so much disapproved. The imperious parliament
would hearken to none of these reasons or remonstrances.
Elated with the numerous successes, which they had ob∣tained
over their domestic enemies, they thought, that
every thing must yiel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to their fortunate arms; and they
gladly seized the opportunity, which they sought, of
making war upon the States. They demanded, that,
without any farther delay or enquiry, reparation should
be made for all the damages, which the English had sus∣tained.
And when this demand was not complied
with, they dispatched orders for commencing war against
the United Provinces.</P>
<P>BLAKE sailed northwards with a numerous fleet, and
fell upon the herring bushes, which were escorted by
twelve men of war. All these he either took or dis∣persed.
Tromp followed him with a fleet of above a hun∣dred
sail. When these two admirals were within sight
<PB N="222" REF="294"/>
of each other, and preparing for battle, a furious storm
attacked them. Blake took shelter in the English har∣bours.
The Dutch fleet was dispersed and received
great damage.</P>
<P>SIR GEORGE AYSCUE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of Au∣gust.</NOTE> though he commanded only
forty ships according to the English accounts, engaged
near Plymouth the famous de Ruiter, who had under him
fifty ships of war, with thirty merchant-men. The
Dutch ships were indeed of inferior force to the Eng∣lish.
De Ruiter, the only admiral in Europe, who has
attained a renown equal to that of the greatest general,
defended himself so well, that Ayscue gained no advan∣tage
over him. Night parted them in the greatest heat
of the action. De Ruiter next day sailed off with his

that they were not able to pursue.</P>
<P>NEAR the coast of Kent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> Blake, seconded by Bourne
and Pen, met the Dutch fleet; nearly equal in number,
commanded by de Witte and de Ruiter. A battle was
fought much to the disadvantage of the Dutch. Their
rear-admiral was boarded and taken. Two other vessels
were sunk, and one blown up. The Dutch fleet next
day made sail towards Holland.</P>
<P>THE English were not so successful in the Mediterra∣nean.

his victory with the loss of his life.</P>
<P>SEA-FIGHTS are seldom so decisive as to disable the<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of No∣vember.</NOTE>
vanquished from making head in a little time against the
victors. Tromp, seconded by de Ruiter, met near the
Goodwins, with Blake, whose fleet was inferior to the
Dutch, but who was resolved not to decline the com∣bat.
A furious battle commenced, where the admirals
on both sides, as well as the inferior officers and sea∣men,
exerted extraordinary bravery. In this action,
<PB N="223" REF="295"/>
the Dutch had the advantage. Blake himself was
wounded. The Garland and Bonaventure were taken.
Two ships were burned, and one sunk; and night came
very opportunely to save the English fleet. After this
victory, Tromp in a bravado fixed a broom to his main∣mast;
as if he were resolved to sweep the sea entirely of
all English vessels.</P>
<P>GREAT preparations were made in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> in order
to wipe off this disgrace. A gallant fleet of eighty sail
was fitted out. Blake commanded, and Dean under
him, together with Monk, who had been sent for from
Scotland. When the English lay off Portland, they
descried near break of day the Dutch fleet of seventy-six<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE>
vessels, sailing up the channel, along with a convoy of
300 merchant-men, who had received orders to wait at
the isle of Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eA, till the fleet should arrive to escorte
them. Tromp and de Ruiter commanded the Dutch.
This battle was the most furious which had yet been
fought, between these warlike and rival nations. Three
days was the battle continued with the utmost rage and
obstinacy: and Blake, who was victor, gained not more
honour than Tromp, who was vanquished. The Dutch
admiral made a skilful retreat, and saved all the mer∣chant
ships, except thirty. He lost however eleven
ships of war, had 2000 men slain, and near 1500 taken
prisoners. The English, though many of their ships
were extremely shattered, had but one sunk. Their slain
were not much inferior in number to those of the ene∣my.</P>
<P>ALL these successes of the English were chiefly owing
to the superior size of their vessels; an advantage which
all the skill and bravery of the Dutch admirals could not
compensate By means of ship-money, an imposition,
which had been so much complained of, and in some re∣spects
with reason, the late King had put the navy into

a situation, which it had never attain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in any former
reign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> and he ventured to build ships of a size, which
was then unusual. But the misfortunes, which the Dutch
met with in battle, were small in comparison of those,
which their trade sustained from the English. Their
whole commerce by the Channel was cut off: Even that
to the Baltic was much infested by the English priva∣teers.
Their fisheries were totally suspended. A great
number of their ships, above 1600, had fallen into the
enemies hands. And all this distress they suffered, not
for any national interest or necessity; but from vain
points of honour and personal resentments, of which it
was difficult to give a satisfactory account to the public.
They resolved therefore to gratify the pride of the par∣liament,
and to make some advances towards a peace.
Their reception, however, was not favourable; and it
was not without pleasure, that they learned the dissolu∣tion
of that haughty assembly by the violence of Crom∣wel;
an event from which they expected a more prospe∣rous
turn to their affairs.</P>
<P>THE zealous republicans in the parliament had not
been the chief or first promoters of the war; but when
it was once entered upon, they endeavoured to draw
from it every possible advantage. On all occasions, they
set up the fleet in opposition to the army, and celebrated
the glory and successes of their naval armaments. They
insisted on the intolerable expence to which the nation
was subjected, and urged the necessity of diminishing it
by a reduction of their land forces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissolution of the par∣liament.</NOTE> They had ordered
some regiments to serve on board the fleet in the quality
of marines: And Cromwel, by the whole train of their
proceedings, evidently saw, that they had entertained a
jealousy of his power and ambition, and were resolved
to bring him to a subordination under their authority.
Without scruple or delay he resolved to prevent them.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="299"/>
ON such firm foundations was built the credit of this
extraordinary man, that, though a great master of
fraud and dissimulation, he judged it superfluous to em∣ploy
any disguise in conducting that bold enterprize.
He summoned a general council of officers; and imme∣diately
found, that they were disposed to receive what∣ever
impressions he was pleased to give them. Most of
them were his creatures, had owed their advancement to
his favour, and relied entirely upon him for their fu∣ture
preferment. The breach being already made be∣tween
the military and civil powers, when the late King
was seized at Holmby; the general officers regarded the
parliament as at once their creature and their rival; and
thought that they themselves were entitled to share among
them those offices and riches, of which its members had
so long kept possession. Harrison, Rich, Overton, and
a few others, who retained some principle, were guided
by notions so extravagant, that they were easily deluded
into measures the most violent and most criminal. And
the whole army had already been guilty of such illegal
and atrocious actions, that they could entertain no far∣ther
scruples with regard to any enterprize, which might
serve their selfish or fanatical purposes.</P>
<P>IN the council of officers it was presently voted to
frame a remonstrance to the parliament. After com∣plaining
of the arrears, which were due to the army,
they there desired the parliament to remember how many
years they had sat, and what professions they had for∣merly
made of their intentions to new model the repre∣sentative,
and establish successive parliaments, who might
bear that burthen of national affairs, from which they
themselves would gladly, after so much danger and fa∣tigue,
be at last relieved. They confessed, that the par∣liament
had atchieved great enterprizes, and had sur∣mounted
mighty difficulties; yet was it an injury, they
said, to the rest of the nation to be excluded from bear∣ing
<PB N="226" REF="300"/>
any part in the service of their country. It was now
full time for them to give place to others; and they
therefore desired them, after settling a council, who
might execute the laws during the interval, to summon
a new parliament, and establish that free and equal go∣vernment,
which they had so long promised to the
people.</P>
<P>THE parliament took this remonstrance in very ill
part, and made a sharp reply to the council of officers.
The officers insisted on their advice; and by mutual al∣tercation
and opposition, the breach became still wider
between the army and the Commonwealth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of April.</NOTE> Cromwel,
finding matters ripe for his purpose, called a council of
officers, in order to come to a determination with regard
to the public settlement. As he had here many friends,
so had he also some opponents. Harrison having assured
the council, that the General sought only to pave the way
for the government of Jesus and his saints, Major Streater
briskly replied, that Jesus ought then to come quickly:
For if he delayed it till after Christmas, he would come
too late; he would find his place occupied While the
officers were in debate, Colonel Ingoldsby informs
Cromwel, that the parliament were sitting, and had
come to a resolution not to dissolve themselves, but to
fill up the house by new elections; and were at that
very time engaged in deliberations with regard to this
expedient. Cromwel in a ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e immediately hastens to
the house, and carries a body of 300 soldiers along with
him. Some of them he placed at the door, some in the
lobby, some on the stairs. He first addressed himself to
his friend St. John, and told him, that he had come
with a purpose of doing what grieved him to the very
soul, and what he had earnestly with tears prayed th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lord not to impose upon him: But there was a neces∣sity,
in order to the glory of God and good of the na∣tion.
He sat down for some time, and heard the de∣bat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
<PB N="227" REF="301"/>
He beckoned Harrison, and told him, that he
now judged the parliament ripe for a dissolution, “Sir,”
said Harrison, “the work is very great and dangerous:
I desire you seriously to consider, before you engage in
it.” “You say well,” replied the General; and thereupon
sat still about a quarter of an hour. When the question
was ready to be put, he said again to Harrison, “This
is the time: I must do it.” And suddenly starting
up, he loaded the parliament with the vilest reproaches,
for their tyranny, ambition oppression, and robbery of
the public. Then stamping with his foot, which was
the signal for the soldiers to enter, “For shame,” said
he to the parliament, “get you gone: Give place to
honester men; to those who will more faithfully dis∣charge
their trust. You are no longer a parliament:
I tell you, you are no longer a parliament. The
Lord has done with you: He has chosen other in∣struments
for carrying on his work.” Sir Harry
Vane exclaiming against this procedure, he cried with a
loud voice, “O! Sir Harry Vane, Sir Harry Vane!
The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!” Tak∣ing
hold of Martin by the cloke, “Thou art a
whore master,” said he. To another, “Thou art
an adulterer. To a third, Thou art a drunkard
and a glutton:” “And thou an extortioner,” to a
fourth. He commanded a soldier to seize the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce.
“What shall we do with this bauble? Here take it
away. It is you,” said he, addressing himself to the
house, “that have forced me upon this. I have sought
the Lord, night and day, that he would rather slay
me than put me upon this work.” Having com∣manded
the soldiers to clear the hall, he himself went
out the last, and ordering the doors to be locked, de∣parted
to his lodgings in Whitehall.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="302"/>
IN this furious manner, which so well denotes his ge∣nuine
character, did Cromwel, without the least oppo∣sition,
or even murmur, annihilate that famous assem∣bly,
which had filled all Europe with the renown of its
actions, and with astonishment at its crimes, and whose
commencement was not more ardently desired by the
people than was its final dissolution. All parties now
reaped successively the dismal pleasure of seeing the in∣juries,
which they had suffered, revenged on their ene∣mies;
and that too by the same arts, which had been
practised against them. The King had stretched his
prerogative beyond its just bounds; and aided by the
church, had well nigh put an end to all the liberties and
privileges of the nation. The presbyterians checked
the progress of the court and clergy, and excited, by
cant and hypocrisy, the populace first to tumults, then
to war, against the King, the peers, and all the roya∣lists.
No sooner had they reached the pinnacle of gran∣deur,
than the independants, under the appearance of
still greater sanctity, instigated the army against them,
and reduced them to subjection. The independants,
amidst their empty dreams of liberty, or rather of do∣minion,
were oppressed by the rebellion of their own
servants, and found themselves at once exposed to the
insults of power and hatred of the people. By recent,
as well as all antient example, it was become evident,
that illegal violence, with whatever pretences it may be
covered, and whatever object it may pursue, must in∣evitably
end at last in the arbitrary and despotic govern∣ment
of a single person.</P>

<P>OLIVER CROMWEL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXI.</NOTE> in whose hands the dis∣solution
of the parliament had left the whole power,
civil and military, of three kingdoms, was born at
Huntingdon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel's birth and pri∣vate life.</NOTE> the last year of the former century, of a
very good family; tho' he himself, being the son of a
second brother, inherited but a small estate from his fa∣ther.
In the course of his education he had been sent
to the university; but his genius was found little fitted
for the calm and elegant occupations of learning; and
he made small proficiency in his studies. He even threw
himself into a very dissolute and disorderly course of life;
and he consumed, in gaming, drinking, debauchery,
and country riots, the more early years of his youth,
and dissipated part of his patrimony. All of a sudden,
the spirit of reformation seized him; he married, af∣fected
a grave and composed behaviour, entered into all
the zeal and rigour of the puritanical party, and offered
to restore to every one whatever sums he had formerly
gained by gaming. The same vehemence of temper,
which had transported him into the extremes of pleasure,
now distinguished his religious habits. His house was
<PB N="230" REF="304"/>
the resort of all the zéalous clergy of the party; and his
hospitality, as well as his liberalities to the silenced and
deprived ministers, proved as chargeable as his former
debaucheries. Tho' he had acquired a tolerable fortune
by a maternal uncle, he found his affairs so injured by his
expences, that he was obliged to take a farm at St. Ives,
and apply himself, for some years, to agriculture as a pro∣fession.
But this expedient served rather to involve him in
farther debts and difficulties. The long prayers which he
said to his family in the morning, and again in the afternoon,
consumed his own time and that of his ploughmen; and
he reserved no leisure for the care of his temporal affairs,
His active mind, superior to the low occupations, to
which he was condemned, preyed upon itself; and he
indulged his imagination in visions, illuminations, revela∣tions;
the great nourishment of that hypocondriacal
temper, to which he was ever subject. Urged by his
wants and his devotions, he had formed a party with
Hambden, his near kinsman, who was pressed only by
the latter motive, to transport himself into New England,
now become the retreat of the more zealous among the
puritanical party; and it was an order of council, which
obliged them to disembark and remain in England. The
Earl of Bedford, who possessed a large estate in the Fen
Country, near the isle of Ely, having undertaken to
drain these moraffes, was obliged to apply to the King;
and by the powers of the prerogative, he got commis∣sioners
appointed, who conducted that work, and divided
the new acquired land among the several proprietors.
He met with opposition from many, among whom
Cromwel distinguished himself; and this was the first
public opportunity, which he had met met with, of dis∣covering
the factious zeal and obstinacy of his character.</P>
<P>FROM accident and intrigue he was chosen by the
town of Cambridge member of the long parliament.
His domestic affairs were then in great disorder; and he
<PB N="231" REF="305"/>
seemed not to possess any talents, which could qualify
him to rise in that public sphere, into which he was now
at last entered. His person was ungraceful, his dress
slovenly, his voice untuneable, his elocution homely,
tedious, obscure, and embarrassed. The fervor of his
spirit frequently prompted him to rise in the house; but
he was not heard with attention: His name, for above
two years, is not to be found oftener than twice in any
committee; and those committees, into which he was
admitted, were chosen for affairs, which would more in∣terest
the zealots than the men of business. In compa∣rison
of the eloquent speakers and fine gentlemen of the
house, he was entirely overlooked; and his friend Hamb∣den
alone was acquainted with the depth of his genius,
and foretold, that if a civil war should ensue, he would
soon rise to eminence and distinction.</P>
<P>CROMWEL himself seems to have been conscious
where his strength lay; and partly from that motive,
partly from the uncontroleable fury of his zeal, he al∣ways
joined that party, which pushed every thing to ex∣tremity
against the King. He was very active for the
famous remonstrance, which was the signal for all the
ensuing commotions; and when, after a long debate, it
was carried by a small majority, he told Lord Falkland,
that, if the question had been lost, he was resolved next
day to have converted into ready money the remains of
his fortune, and immediately to have left the kingdom.
Nor was this resolution, he said, peculiar to himself:
Many others of his party he knew to be equally deter∣mined.</P>
<P>HE was no less than forty-three years of age, when he
first embraced the military profession; and by force of
genius, without any master, he soon became an excel∣lent
officer; tho' perhaps he never reached the fame of
a consummate commander. He raised a troop of horse,
<PB N="232" REF="306"/>
fixed his quarters in Cambridge, exerted great severity
towards that university, which zealously adhered to the
royal party; and showed himself a man who would go
all lengths in favour of that cause, which he had
espoused. He would not allow his soldiers to perplex
their heads with those subtilties of fighting by the King's
authority against his person, and of obeying his Majesty's
orders signified by both houses of parliament: He plainly
told them, that, if he met the King in battle, he would
fire a pistol in his face as readily as against any other
man. His troop of horse he soon augmented to a regi∣ment,
and he first instituted that discipline and inspired
that spirit, which rendered the parliamentary armies in
the end victorious. “Your troops,” said he to Hamb∣den,
according to his own account<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Conference held at Whitehall.</NOTE>, “are most of
them old decayed serving men and tapsters, and such
kind of fellows; the King's forces are composed of
gentlemen's younger sons and persons of good quality.
And do you think, that the mean spirits of such base
and low fellows as ours will ever be able to encounter
gentlemen, that have honour and courage and reso∣lution
in them? You must get men of spirit; and
take it not ill that I say, of a spirit, that is likely to
go as far as gentlemen will go, or else I am sure
you will still be beaten, as you have hitherto been, in
every rencounter.” He did as he proposed. He in∣listed
freeholders and farmers sons. He carefully invited
into his regiment all the zealous fanatics throughout
England. When collected in a body, their enthusiastic
spirit still rose to a higher pitch. Their colonel, from
his own natural character, as much as from policy, was
sufficiently inclined to encrease the flame. He preached,
he prayed, he fought, he punished, he rewarded. The
wild enthusiasm, together with valour and discipline,
still propagated itself; and all men cast their eyes on so
<PB N="233" REF="307"/>
pious and so successful a leader. From low commands,
he rose with great rapidity to be really the first, tho' in
appearance only the second, in the army. By fraud
and violence, he soon rendered himself the first in the
state. In proportion to the increase of his authority,
his talents seemed always to expand themselves; and
he displayed every day new abilities, which had lain dor∣mant
till the very emergence, by which they were called
forth into action. All Europe stood astonished to see a
nation, so turbulent and unruly, who, for some en∣croachments
on their privileges, had dethroned and mur∣dered
an excellent Prince, descended from a long line of
monarchs, now at last subdued and reduced to slavery by
one, who, a few years before, was no better than a pri∣vate
gentleman, whose name was not known in the na∣tion,
and who was very little regarded even in that low
sphere, to which he had always been confined.</P>
<P>THE indignation, entertained by the people, against
an authority, founded on such manifest usurpation, was
not so violent as might naturally be expected. Con∣gratulatory
addresses, the first of the kind, were made
to Cromwel by the fleet, the army, even many of the
chief corporations and counties of England; but espe∣cially
by the several congregations of pretended saints,
dispersed throughout the kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Milton's State papers.</NOTE>. The royalists,
tho' they could not love the man, who had embrued his
hands in the blood of their sovereign, expected more le∣nity
from him, than from the jealous and imperious re∣publicans,
who had hitherto governed. The presbyte∣rians
were pleased to see those men, by whom they had
been outwitted and expelled, now in the end expelled
and outwitted by their own servant; and they applauded
him, for this last act of violence upon the parliament.
These two parties composed the bulk of the nation, and
kept the people in some tolerable temper. All men,
<PB N="234" REF="308"/>
likewise, harrassed with wars and factions, were glad to
see any prospect of justice and settlement. And they
deemed it less ignominious to submit to a person of such
admirable talents and capacity than to a few ignoble en∣thusiastic
hypocrites, who, under the name of a republic,
had reduced them to a cruel subjection.</P>
<P>THE republicans being dethroned by Cromwel, were
the party whose resentment he had the greatest reason to
apprehend. That party, besides the independants, con∣tained
two sets of men, who are seemingly of the most
opposite principles, but who were then united by a simi∣litude
of genius and of character. The first and most
numerous were the millenarians, or fifth monarchy men,
who insisted, that, dominion being founded in grace, all
distinction of magistracy must be abolished, except what
arose from piety and holiness; who expected suddenly
the second coming of Christ upon earth; and who pre∣tended,
that the saints in the mean while, that is, them∣selves,
were alone entitled to govern. The second were
the deists, who had no other object than political liber∣ty,
who denied entirely the truth of revelation, and in∣sinuated,
that all the various sects, so heated against each
other were alike founded in folly and in error. Men
of such daring geniuses were not contented with the
established forms of civil government; but challenged a
degree of freedom beyond what they expected ever to
enjoy under any monarchy. Martin, Challoner, Har∣rington,
Sidney, Wildman, Nevil, were esteemed the
heads of this small division.</P>
<P>THE deists were perfectly hated by Cromwel, because
he had no hold of enthusiasm by which he could govern∣or
over-reach them; he therefore treated them with
great rigor and disdain, and usually denominated then
the <HI>heathens.</HI> As the millenarians had a great intere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in the army, it was much more important for him t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="235" REF="309"/>
gain their confidence; and their size of understanding
afforded him great facility in deceiving them. Of late
years, it had been so usual a topic of conversation to
discourse of parliaments and councils and senates, and
the soldiers themselves had been so much accustomed to
enter into that spirit, that Cromwel thought it requisite
to establish something which might bear the face of a
commonwealth. He supposed, that God, in his provi∣dence,
had thrown the whole right as well as power of
government into his hands; and without any more ce∣remony,
by the advice of his council of officers, he sent
summons to a hundred and twenty-eight persons of dif∣ferent
towns and counties of England, to five of Scot∣land,
to six of Ireland. He pretended, by his sole act
and deed, to devolve upon these persons the whole au∣thority
of the state.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barebone's Parliament.</NOTE> This legislative power they were
to exercise during fifteen months; and they were after∣wards
to choose the same number of persons, who might
succeed them in that high and important office.</P>
<P>THERE were great numbers at that time, always dis∣posed
to adhere to the power, which was uppermost,
and to support the established government. This maxim
is not peculiar to the people of that age; but what may
be esteemed peculiar to them, is, that there prevailed an
hypocritical phrase for expressing so prudential a conduct:
It was called a waiting upon providence. When pro∣vidence,
therefore, was so kind as to bestow on these
persons, now assembled together, the supreme authority,
they must have been very ungrateful, if, in their turn,
they had been wanting in complaisance towards it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of July.</NOTE> They
immediately voted themselves a parliament; and having
their own consent, as well as that of Oliver Cromwel,
for their legislative authority, they now proceeded very
gravely to the exercise of it.</P>
<P>IN this notable assembly were some persons of the rank
of gentlemen; but the far greatest part were low me∣chanics;
<PB N="236" REF="310"/>
fifth monarchy men, anabaptists, antinomians,
independants; the very dregs of the fanatics. They
began with seeking God by prayer: This office was
performed by eight or ten <HI>gifted</HI> men of the as∣sembly;
and with so much success, that, according to
the confession of all, they had never before, in any of
their devout exercises, enjoyed so much of the holy
spirit as was then communicated to them. Their hearts
were, no doubt, dilated when they considered the high
dignity, to which they supposed themselves exalted.
They had been told by Cromwel in his first discourse,
that he never looked to see such a day, when Christ
should be so owned<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">These are his expressions. “Indeed, I have but one word more to say to you, tho' in that perhaps I shall show my weakness: It is by way of encouragement to you in this work; give me leave to begin thus: I con∣fess I never looked to have seen such a day as this, it may be nor you nei∣ther, when Jesus Christ should be so owned as he is at this day and in this work. Jesus Christ is owned this day by your call, and you own him by your willingness to appear for him, and you manifest this (as far as poor creatures can do) to be a day of the power of Christ. I know you well remember that scripture, <HI>he makes his people willing in the day of his power.</HI> God manifests it to be the day of the power of Christ, having thro' so much blood and so much tryal as has been upon this nation, he makes this one of the greatest mercies, next to his own son, to have his people called to the supreme authority. God hath owned his son, and hath owned you, and hath made you to own him. I confess, I never looked to have seen such a day: I did not.” I suppose at this passage he cried: For he was very much given to weeping, and could at any time shed abundance of tears. The rest of the speech may be seen among Milton's State papers, page 106. It is very curious, and full of the same obscurity, confusion, embarrassment and absurdity, which appear in almost all Oliver's productions.</NOTE>. They thought it therefore their
duty to proceed to a thorough reformation, and to pave
the way for the reign of the Redeemer, and for that
great work, which, it was expected, the Lord was to
bring forth among them. All fanatics, being conse∣crated
by their own fond imaginations, naturally bear an
antipathy to the clergy, who claim a peculiar sanctity,
derived merely from their office and priestly character.
This parliament took into consideration the abolition of
<PB N="237" REF="311"/>
the clerical function, as favouring of popery; and the
taking away tythes, which they called a relict of Ju∣daism.
Learning also and the universities they deemed
heathenish and unnecessary: The common law they de∣nominated
a badge of the conquest and of Norman sla∣very;

of their profession. Some steps were even taken to∣wards
an abolition of the chancery<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 543, 548.</NOTE>, the highest court
of judicature in the kingdom; and the Mosaical law

<P>OF all the extraordinary schemes, adopted by these
legislators, they had not leisure to finish any, except
that which established the legal solemnization of mar∣riage
by the civil magistrate alone, without the interpo∣sition
of the clergy. They found themselves exposed to
the derision of the public. Among the fanatics of the
house, there was a very active member, much noted for
long prayers, sermons, and harangues. He was a lea∣ther-seller
in London: His name <HI>Praise-god Barebone.</HI>
This ridiculous name, which seems to have been chosen
by some poet or allegorist to suit so ridiculous a person∣age,
struck the fancy of the people; and they com∣monly

THE Dutch ambassadors endeavoured to enter into
negotiation with this parliament; but tho' protestants
and even presbyterians, they met with a very bad recep∣tion
from those who pretended to a sanctity so much su∣perior.
The Hollanders were regarded as worldly minded
men, intent only on commerce and industry; whom it
was fitting the saints should first eradicate, ere they un∣dertook
that great work, to which they believed them∣selves
destined by providence, of subduing Antichrist,
the man of sin, and extending to the uttermost bounds
of the earth the kingdom of the Redeemer<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. I. p. 273, 591. Also Stubbe, p. 91, 92.</NOTE>. The am∣bassadors,
finding themselves proscribed, not as enemies
of England, but of Christ, remained in astonishment,
and knew not which was most to be admired, the im∣placable
spirit or egregious folly of these pretended
saints.</P>
<P>CROMWEL began to be ashamed of his legislature.
If he ever had any other design in summoning so pre∣posterous
an assembly beyond amusing the populace and
the army; he had intended to alarm the clergy and
lawyers; and he had so far succeeded as to make them
desire any other government, which might secure their
professions, now brought in danger by these desperate fa∣natics.
Cromwel himself was dissatisfied, that the par∣liament,
tho' they had received all their authority from
him, began to pretend power from the Lord<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. I. p. 393.</NOTE>, and to
<PB N="239" REF="313"/>
insist already on their divine commission. He had
carefully summoned in his writs several persons entirely
devoted to him. By concert, these met early; and it
was mentioned by some among them, that the sitting of
this parliament any longer would be of no service to
the nation. They hastened, therefore, to Cromwel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of De∣cember.</NOTE>
along with Rouse, their speaker; and by a formal deed
or assignment, resigned back into his hands that supreme
authority, which they had so lately received from him.
General Harrison and about twenty more remained in
the house; and that they might prevent the reign of the
saints from coming to an untimely end, they placed one
Moyer in the chair, and began to draw up protests.
They were soon interrupted by Colonel White, with a
party of soldiers. He asked them what they did there.
“We are seeking the Lord,” said they. “Then you
may go elsewhere,” replied he: For to my certain
“knowledge, he has not been here these several
years.”</P>
<P>THE military being now in appearance, as well as in
reality, the sole power which prevailed in the nation,
Cromwel thought fit to indulge a new fancy: For he
seems not to have had any concerted plan in all these
alterations. Lambert, his creature, who, under the
appearance of obsequiousness to him, indulged a most
unbounded ambition, proposed in a council of officers
to adopt another scheme of government, and to temper
the liberty of a Commonwealth by the authority of a
single person, who should be known by the appellation
of Protector. Without delay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel made Pro∣tector.</NOTE> he prepared what was
called the Instrument of Government, containing the
plan of this new legislature; and as it was supposed to
be agreeable to the general, it was immediately voted
by the council of officers. Cromwel was declared Pro∣tector;
and with great solemnity installed in that high
office.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="314"/>
SO little were these men endowed with the spirit of
legislation, that they confessed, or rather boasted, that
they had employed only four days in drawing this in∣strument,
by which the whole government of the three
kingdoms was pretended to be regulated and adjusted
for all succeeding generations. There appears no diffi∣culty
in believing them; when it is considered how
crude and undigested a system of civil polity they en∣deavoured
to establish. The chief articles of the in∣strument
are these: A council was appointed, which
was not to exceed twenty-one, nor be less than thirteen
persons. These were to enjoy their office during life or
good behaviour; and in case of a vacancy, the remain∣ing
members named three, of whom the Protector chose
one. The Protector was appointed the supreme magis∣trate
of the Commonwealth: In his name was all jus∣tice
administered; from him were all magistracy and all
honours derived; he had the power of pardoning all
crimes, excepting murder and treason; to him the be∣nefit
of all forfeitures devolved. The right of peace,
war, and alliance, rested in him; but in these particu∣lars
he was to act entirely by the advice and with the
consent of his council. The power of the sword was
vested in the Protector, jointly with the parliament,
while it was sitting, or with the council of state in the
intervals. He was obliged to summon a parliament
every three years, and allow them to sit five months,
without adjournment, prorogation, or dissolution. The
bills, which they enacted, were to be presented to the
Protector for his consent; but if within twenty days it
was not obtained, they were to pass into laws by the
authority alone of the parliament. A standing army for
Britain and Ireland was established, of 20,000 foot and
10,000 horse; and funds were assigned for their sup∣port.
These were not to be diminished without con∣sent
of the Protector; and in this article alone he as∣sumed
<PB N="241" REF="315"/>
a negative. During the intervals of parliament,
the Protector and council had the power of enacting
laws, which were valid till the first meeting of parlia∣ment.
The chancellor, treasurer, admiral, chief go∣vernors
of Ireland and Scotland, and the chief justices
of both the benches must be chosen with the approba∣tion
of parliament; and in the intervals, with the ap∣probation
of the council, to be afterwards ratified by
parliament. The Protector enjoyed his office during
life; and on his death, the place was immediately to be
supplied by the council. This was the instrument of
government enacted by the council of officers, and so∣lemnly
sworn to by Oliver Cromwel. The council of
state named by the Instrument were fifteen; men en∣tirely
devoted to the Protector, and not likely, by rea∣son
of the opposition among themselves in party and
principles, ever to combine against him.</P>
<P>CROMWEL said, that he accepted the dignity of Pro∣tector,
merely that he might exert the duty of a con∣stable;
and preserve peace in the nation. Affairs indeed
were brought to that pass, by the furious animosities of
the several factions, that the extensive authority and
even arbitrary power of some first magistrate was become
a necessary evil, in order to keep the people from relap∣sing
into blood and confusion. The independants were
too small a party ever to establish a popular government,
or entrust the nation, where they had so little interest,
with the free choice of its own representatives. The
presbyterians had adopted the violent maxims of perse∣cution;
incompatible at all times with the peace of so∣ciety,
much more with the wild zeal of those numerous
sects, which prevailed among the people. The royalists
were so much enraged by the injuries, which they had
suffered, that the other prevailing parties would never
submit to them, who, they knew, were enabled merely
by the execution of the antient laws, to take such se∣vere

revenge upon them. Had Cromwel been guilty of
no crime but this temporary usurpation, the plea of ne∣cessity
and public good, which he alleged, might be al∣lowed,
in every view, a very reasonable excuse for his
conduct.</P>
<P>DURING the variety of ridiculous and distracted scenes,
which the civil government presented in England, the
military force was exerted with the utmost vigor, con∣duct,
and unanimity; and never did the kingdom appear
more formidable to all foreign nations. The English
fleet, consisting of a hundred sail, and commanded by
Monk and Dean, and under them by Pen and Lau∣son,
met, near the coast of Flanders, with the Dutch
fleet, equally numerous, and commanded by Tromp.
The two republics were not inflamed by any national
antipathy, and their interests very little interfered: Yet
few battles have been fought with more fierce and ob∣stinate
courage than were those many naval combats,
which occurred during this short, but violent war. The
desire of remaining sole lords of the ocean animated
these states to an honourable emulation against each
other. After a battle of two days, in the first of which
Dean was killed, the Dutch, inferior in the size of their
ships, were obliged, with great loss, to retire into their
harbours. Blake, towards the end of the fight, joined
his countrymen with 18 sail. The English fleet lay off
the coast of Holland, and totally interrupted the com∣merce
of that republic.</P>
<P>THE ambassadors, whom the Dutch had sent into
England, gave them hopes of peace. But as they could
obtain no cessation of hostilities, the states, unwilling to
suffer any longer the loss and disgrace of being blockaded
by their enemy, made the utmost efforts to recover their
injured honour. Never on any occasion did the power
and vigor of that state appear in a more conspicuous
<PB N="243" REF="319"/>
light. In a few weeks, they had repaired and manned
their fleet; and they equipped some ships of a larger size,
than any which they had hitherto sent to sea. Tromp
issued out, determined again to fight the victors, and to
die rather than to yield the contest. He met with the
enemy, commanded by Monk; and both sides imme∣diately
rushed into the combat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of July.</NOTE> Tromp, gallantly ani∣mating
his men, with his sword drawn, was shot thro'
the heart with a musquet ball. This event alone de∣cided
the battle in favour of the English. Tho' near
thirty ships of the Dutch were sunk and taken, they little
regarded this loss compared with that of their brave ad∣miral.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the negotiations of peace were conti∣nually
advancing. The states, overwhelmed with the
expences of the war, terrified by their losses, and mor∣tified
by their defeats, were infinitely desirous of an ac∣commodation
with an enemy whom they found, by ex∣perience,
to be too powerful for them. The King
having shown a desire to serve on board their fleet; tho'
they expressed their sense of the honour intended them,
they declined an offer, which might enflame the quarrel
with the English Commonwealth. The great obstacle
to the peace was found not to be any animosity in the
English; but on the contrary a desire too earnest of
union and confederacy. Cromwel had revived the chi∣merical
scheme of a coalition with the United Provinces;
a total conjunction of government, privileges, interests,
and councils. This project appeared so wild to the
States General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1654.</NOTE> that they wondered any man of sense
could ever entertain it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE> and they refused to enter into
conferences with regard to a proposal, which could serve
only to delay any practicable scheme of accommodation.
The peace was at last signed by Cromwel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Holland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> now invested
with the dignity of Protector; and it proves sufficiently,
that the war had been very impolitic, since after the
<PB N="244" REF="320"/>
most signal victories, no terms more advantageous could
be obtained. A defensive league was made between the
two republics. They agreed, each of them, to banish
the enemies of the other; those concerned in the mas∣sacre
of Amboyna were to be punished, if any remained
alive; the honour of the flag was yielded to the Eng∣lish;
eighty-five thousand pounds were stipulated to be
payed by the Dutch East India company for losses, which
the English company had sustained; and the island of
Polarone in the East Indies was promised to be yielded
to the latter.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, jealous of the connexions between the
royal family and that of Orange, insisted on a separate
article; that neither the young Prince nor any of his fa∣mily
should ever be invested with the dignity of Stad∣holder.
The province of Holland, strongly prejudiced
against that office, which they esteemed dangerous to li∣berty,
secretly ratified this article. The Protector,
knowing that the other provinces would never be in∣duced
to make such a concession, was satisfied with
that security.</P>
<P>THE Dutch war, being successful, and the peace
reasonable, brought credit to Cromwel's administration.
An act of justice, which he exercised at home, gave
likewise satisfaction to the people; tho' the regularity of
it may perhaps appear somewhat doubtful. Don Pan∣taleon
Sa, brother to the Portuguese ambassador, and
joined with him in the same commission<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. II. p. 429.</NOTE>, fancying
himself insulted in London, came into the Exchange,
armed and attended with several servants. By mistake,
he fell upon a gentleman, whom he took for the person
that had given him the offence, and having butchered
him with many wounds, he and all his accomplices
took shelter in the house of the Portuguese ambassador,
<PB N="245" REF="321"/>
who had connived at this base enterprize<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 616.</NOTE>. The po∣pulace
surrounded the house, and threatened to set it
on fire. Cromwel sent a guard, who seized all the cri∣minals.
They were brought to trial: And notwith∣standing
the opposition of the ambassador, who pleaded
the privileges of his office, Don Pantaleon was execut∣ed
on Tower-hill. The laws of nations were here
plainly violated: But the crime committed by the Por∣tuguese
gentleman was to the last degree atrocious;
and the vigorous chastisement of it, suiting so well the
undaunted character of Cromwel, was universally ap∣proved
at home and admired among foreign nations.
The situation of Portugal obliged that court to acquiesce;
and the ambassador soon after signed with the Protector
a treaty of peace and alliance, which was very advanta∣geous
to the English commerce.</P>
<P>ANOTHER act of severity, but necessary in his situa∣tion,
was, at the very same time, exercised by the Pro∣tector,
in the capital punishment of Gerard and Vowel,
two royalists, who were accused of conspiring against
his life. He had erected a high court of justice for their
trial; an infringement of the antient laws, which at
this time was become familiar, but one to which no
custom or precedent could reconcile the nation. Juries
were found altogether unmanageable. The restless Lil∣burn,
for new offences, had been brought to a new
trial; and had been acquitted with new triumph and
exultation. If no other method of conviction had been
devised during this illegal and unpopular government,
all its enemies were assured of entire impunity.</P>
<P>THE Protector had occasion to observe the prejudices
entertained against his government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep∣tember. A new par∣liament.</NOTE> by the disposition of
the parliament, which he summoned on the third of
September, that day of the year, on which he gained
his two great victories of Dunbar and Worcester, and
<PB N="246" REF="322"/>
which he always regarded as fortunate for him. It must
be confessed, that, if we are left to gather Cromwel's
intentions from his instrument of government, it is such
a motley piece, that we cannot easily conjecture, whe∣ther
he seriously meant to establish a tyranny or a repub∣lic.
On one hand, a first magistrate, in so exten∣sive
a government, seemed requisite both for the dignity
and tranquillity of the state; and the authority, which
he assumed as protector, was, in some respects, inferior
to the prerogatives, which the laws entrusted and still
entrust to the King. On the other hand, the legislative
power, which he reserved to himself and council, toge∣ther
with so great an army, independant of the parlia∣ment,
were bad prognostics of his intention to submit to
a civil and legal constitution. But if this was not his
intention, the method, in which he distributed and con∣ducted
the elections, being so favourable to liberty, form
an inconsistency which is not easily accounted for. He
deprived of their right of election all the small burroughs,
places much exposed to influence and corruption. Of
400 members, which represented England, 270 were
chosen by the counties. The rest were elected by Lon∣don,
and the more considerable corporations. The
lower populace too, so easily guided or deceived, were
excluded from the elections: An estate of 200 pounds
value was requisite to entitle any one to a vote. The
elections of this parliament were conducted with perfect
freedom; and, excepting that such of the royalists as had
borne arms against the parliament and all their sons
were excluded, a more fair representation of the people
could not be desired nor expected. Thirty members
were returned from Scotland; as many from Ireland.</P>
<P>THE Protector seems to have been disappointed, when
he found, that all these precautions, which were pro∣bably
nothing but covers to his ambition, had not pro∣cured
him the confidence of the public. Though Crom∣wel's
<PB N="247" REF="323"/>
administration was less odious to every party than
that of any other party, yet was it entirely acceptable to
none of them. The royalists had been instructed by
the King to remain quiet, and to cover themselves un∣der
the appearance of republicans; and they found in
this latter faction such inveterate hatred against the Pro∣tector,
that they could not wish for more zealous adver∣saries
to his authority. It was maintained by them, that
the pretence of liberty and popular election was but a
new artifice of this grand deceiver, in order to lay asleep
the deluded nation, and give himself leisure to rivet their
chains more securely upon them: That in the instru∣ment
of government he openly declared his intention of
still retaining the same mercenary army, by whose assist∣ance
he had subdued the antient, established govern∣ment,
and who would with less scruple obey him, in
overturning, whenever he should please to order them,
that new system, which he himself had been pleased to
model: That being sensible of the danger and uncer∣tainty
of all military government, he endeavoured to in∣termix
some appearance, and but an appearance, of ci∣vil
administration, and to ballance the army by a seem∣ing
consent of the people: That the absurd trial, which
he had made of a parliament, elected by himself, ap∣pointed
perpetually to elect their successors, plainly
proved, that he aimed at nothing but temporary expe∣dients,
was totally averse to a free republican govern∣ment,
and possessed not that mature and deliberate re∣flection,
which could qualify him to act the part of a
legislator: That his imperious character, which had be∣trayed
itself in so many incidents, would never seriously
submit to legal limitations; nor would the very image
of popular government be longer upheld than while it
was conformable to his arbitrary will and pleasure: And
that the best policy was to oblige him to take off the
mask at once; and either submit entirely to that parlia∣ment
<PB N="246" REF="324"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="247" REF="325"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="248" REF="326"/>
which he had summoned, or by totally rejecting
its authority, leave himself no resource but his seditious
and enthusiastic army.</P>
<P>IN prosecution of these views, the parliament, hav∣ing
heard the Protector's speech three hours long<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 588.</NOTE>, and
having chosen Lenthal for their speaker, immediately
entered into a discussion of the pretended instrument of
government, and of that authority, which Cromwel,
under the title of Protector, had assumed over the nation.
The greatest liberty was used in arraigning this new
dignity; and even the personal character and conduct of
Cromwel escaped not altogether without censure. The
utmost, which could be obtained by the officers and by
the court party, for so they were called, was to pro∣tract
the debate by arguments and long speeches, and
prevent the decision of a question, which, they were
sensible, would be carried against them by a great majo∣rity.
The Protector, surprised and enraged at this re∣fractory
spirit in the parliament, which however he
had so much reason to expect, sent for them to the
Painted Chamber, and with an air of great authority in∣veighed
against their conduct. He told them, that no∣thing
could be more absurd than for them to dispute his
title; since the same instrument of government, which
made them a parliament, had invested him with the
Protectorship; that some points in the new constitution
were supposed to be fundamentals, and were not, on
any pretence, to be altered or disputed; that among
these were the government of the nation by one person
and a parliament, their joint authority over the army
and militia, the succession of new parliaments, and li∣berty
of conscience; and that, with regard to these par∣ticulars,
there was reserved to him a negative voice, to
which, in the other circumstances of government, he
confessed himself no wise intitled.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="327"/>
THE Protector now found himself necessitated to ex∣act
a security, which, had he foreseen the spirit of the
house, he would with much better grace have required
at their first meeting<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 620.</NOTE>. He obliged the members to
sign a recognition of his authority, and an engagement
not to propose or consent to any alteration of the go∣vernment,
as it was settled in one single person and a
parliament; and he placed guards at the door of the
house, who allowed none but subscribers to enter. Most
of the members, after some hesitation, submitted to this
condition; but retained the same refractory spirit, which
they had discovered in their first debates. The instru∣ment
of government was taken in pieces, and examined,
one article after another, with the most scrupulous ac∣curacy:
Very free topics were advanced with the gene∣ral
approbation of the house: And during the whole
course of their transactions, they neither sent up one
law to the Protector, nor took any notice of him. Be∣ing
informed, that conspiracies were entered into be∣tween
the members and some malecontent officers of the
army; he hastened to a dissolution of so dangerous an
assembly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1655.</NOTE> By the instrument of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> to which
he had sworn, no parliament could be dissolved, till it
had sate five months; but Cromwel pretended, that a
month contained only twenty-eight days, according to
the method of computation practised in paying the fleet
and army. The full time, therefore, according to this
reckoning, being elapsed; the parliament was ordered
to attend the Protector, where he made them a tedious,
confused, angry harangue, and dismissed them. Were
we to judge of Cromwel's capacity by this, and indeed
by all his other compositions, we should be apt to en∣tertain
no very favourable idea of it. But in the great
variety of human geniuses, there are some, which, tho'
they see their object clearly and distinctly in general;

yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXI.</NOTE> when they come to unfold its parts by discourse or
writing, lose that luminous conception, which they had
before attained. All accounts agree in ascribing to
Cromwel a tiresome, dark, unintelligible elocution,
even when he had no intention to disguise his mean∣ing:
Yet no man's actions were ever, in such a variety
of difficult incidents, more decisive and judicious.</P>
<P>THE electing a discontented parliament is a sure
proof of a discontented nation: The angry and abrupt
dissolution of that parliament is sure always to encrease
the general discontent. The members of this assembly,
returning to their counties, propagated that spirit of
mutiny, which they had exerted in the house. Sir
Harry Vane, and the old republicans, who maintained
the indissoluble authority of the long parliament, en∣couraged
the murmurs against the present usurpation;
though they acted so cautiously as to give the Protector
no handle against them. Wildman and some others of
that party carried still farther their conspiracies against
the Protector's authority. The royalists, observing this
general ill will towards the establishment, could no
longer be retained in subjection; but fancied, that every
one, who was dissatisfied like them, had also embraced
the same views and inclinations. They did not consider,
that all the old parliamentary party, though many of
them were displeased with Cromwel, who had dispossessed
them of their power, were still more apprehensive of any
success to the royal cause; whence, besides a certain
prospect of the same inconvenience, they had so much
reason to dread the severest vengeance for their past
transgressions.</P>
<P>IN concert with the King a conspiracy was entered
into by the royalists throughout England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection of the roya∣lists.</NOTE> and a day of
general rising appointed. Information of this design
was conveyed to Cromwel. The Protector's administra∣tion
was extremely vigilant. Thurloe, his secretary, had
<PB N="251" REF="331"/>
spies every where. Manning, who had access to the
King's family, kept a regular correspondence with him.
And it was not difficult to obtain intelligence of a con∣federacy,
so generally diffused among a party, who va∣lued
themselves more on zeal and courage, than on se∣crecy
and sobriety. Many of the royalists were thrown
into prison. Others, on the approach of the day, were
terrified with the danger of the undertaking, and re∣mained
at home. In one place alone the conspiracy
broke out into action.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of March.</NOTE> Penruddoc, Groves, Jones, and
other gentlemen of the west, entered Salisbury with
about 200 horse; at the very time when the sheriff and
judges were holding the assizes. These they made pri∣soners;
and they proclaimed the King. Contrary to
their expectations, they received no accession of force;
so prevalent was the terror of the established govern∣ment.
Having in vain wandered about for some time,
they were totally discouraged; and one troop of horse
was able at last to suppress them. The leaders of the
conspiracy, being taken prisoners, were capitally punish∣ed.
The rest were sold for slaves, and transported to
Barbadoes.</P>
<P>THE easy subduing this insurrection, which, by the
boldness of the undertaking, struck at first an infinite
terror into the nation, was a singular felicity to the Pro∣tector,
who could not, without danger, have brought
together any considerable body of his mutinous army,
in order to suppress it. The very insurrection itself he
regarded as a fortunate event; since it proved the reality
of those conspiracies, which his enemies, on every oc∣casion,
represented as mere fictions, invented to colour
his jealous severities. He resolved to keep no longer any
terms with the royalists, who, though they were not
perhaps the most implacable of his enemies, were those
whom he could oppress under the most plausible pre∣tences,
and who met with least countenance and pro∣tection
<PB N="252" REF="332"/>
from his adherents. He issued an edict with the
consent of his council, for exacting the tenth penny from
that whole party; in order, as he pretended, to make
them pay the expences, to which their mutinous dispo∣sition
continually exposed the public. Without regard
to compositions, articles of capitulation, or acts of in∣demnity,
all the royalists, however harrassed with former
expences and oppressions, were obliged anew to re∣deem
themselves by great sums of money; and many of
them were reduced by these multiplied disasters to ex∣treme
poverty. Whoever was known to be disaffected,
or even lay under any suspicion, though no guilt could
be proved against him, was exposed to this exaction.</P>
<P>IN order to raise an imposition, so oppressive and ini∣quitous,
the Protector instituted ten<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 88. Most historians say, that the major-generals were eleven: Dugdale and Bates fourteen.</NOTE> major-generals;
and divided the whole kingdom of England into so
many military jurisdictions. These men, assisted by
commissioners, had power to subject whom they pleased
to decimation, to levy all the taxes imposed by the Pro∣tector
and his council, and to imprison any person who
should be exposed to their jealousy or suspicion; nor
was there any appeal from them but to the Protector
himself and his council. Under colour of these powers,
which were sufficiently exorbitant, the major-generals
exercised an authority still more arbitrary, and acted as
if absolute masters of the property and person of every
subject. All reasonable men now concluded, that the
very masque of liberty was thrown aside, and that the
nation was for ever subjected to military and despotic
government, exercised not in the legal manner of Euro∣pean
nations, but according to the maxims of eastern
tyranny. Not only the supreme magistrate owed his
authority to illegal force and usurpation: He had
parcelled out the people into so many subdivisions of
<PB N="253" REF="333"/>
slavery, and had delegated to his inferior ministers the
same unlimited authority, which he himself had so vio∣lently
assumed.</P>
<P>A GOVERNMENT, totally military and despotic, is
sure, after some time, to fall into impotence and lan∣guor:
But when it immediately succeeds a legal consti∣tution,
it may, at first, to foreign nations appear very vi∣gorous
and active, and exert with more unanimity that
power, spirit, and riches, which had been acquired un∣der
a better form of government. It seems now proper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu∣rope.</NOTE>
after so long an interval, to llok abroad to the general
state of Europe, and to consider the measures, which
England, at this time, embraced in its negotiations with
the neighbouring princes. The moderate temper and un∣warlike
genius of the two last princes, the extreme dif∣ficulties
under which they laboured at home, and the
great security which they enjoyed from foreign enemies,
had rendered them very negligent of the transactions of
the continent; and England, during their reigns, had
been in a manner overlooked in the general system of
Europe. The bold and restless genius of the Protector
led him to extend his alliances and enterprizes to every
corner of Christendom; and partly from the ascendant of
his magnanimous spirit, partly from the situation of fo∣reign
kingdoms, the weight of England, even under its
most legal and bravest princes, was never more sensibly
felt than during this unjust and violent usurpation.</P>
<P>A WAR of thirty years, the most signal and most de∣structive
which had appeared in modern annals, was at
last finished in Germany<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">In 1648.</NOTE>; and by the treaty of West∣phalia,
were composed those fatal quarrels, which had
been excited by the Palatine's precipitant acceptance of
the crown of Bohemia. The young Palatine was re∣stored
to a part of his dignities and of his dominions:
<PB N="254" REF="334"/>
The rights, privileges, and authority of the several mem∣bers
of the Germanic body were fixed and ascertained:
Sovereign princes and free states were in some degree re∣duced
to obedience under laws: And by the valour of
the heroic Gustavus, the enterprizes of the active Riche∣lieu,
the intrigues of the artful Mazarine, was in part
effected, after an infinite expence of blood and trea∣sure,
what had been expected and demanded from the
feeble efforts of the pacific James, seconded by the scanty
supplies of his jealous parliaments.</P>
<P>SWEDEN, which had acquired by conquest very large
dominions in the north of Germany, was engaged in
enterprizes, which promised her, from her success and
valour, still more extensive acquisitions on the side both
of Poland and of Denmark. Charles the tenth, who
had mounted the throne of that kingdom after the vo∣luntary
resignation of Christina, being stimulated by
the same of the great Gustavus as well as by his own
martial disposition, carried his conquering arms to the
south of the Baltic, and gained the celebrated victory of
Warsaw, which had been obstinately contested during
the space of three days. The Protector, at the time
his alliance was courted by every power in Europe,
anxiously courted the alliance of Sweden; and he was
fond of forming a confederacy with a protestant power
of such renown, even tho' it threatened the whole north
with conquest and subjection.</P>
<P>THE transactions of the parliament and Protector with
France had been various and complicated. The emis∣saries
of Richelieu had furnished fuel to the flame of re∣bellion,
when it first broke out in Scotland; but after
the conflagration had diffused itself, the French court,
observing the materials to be of themselves sufficiently
combustible, found it unnecessary any longer to animate
the British malecontents to an opposition of their So∣vereign.
<PB N="255" REF="335"/>
On the contrary, they offered their mediation
for composing these intestine disorders; and their am∣bassadors,
from decency, pretended to act in concert
with the court of England, and to receive directions
from a prince, with whom their master was connected
by so near an affinity. Meanwhile, Richelieu died, and
soon after him, the French King, Louis the thirteenth;
leaving his son an infant four years old, and his widow,
Anne of Austria, regent of the kingdom. Cardinal Ma∣zarine
succeeded Richelieu in the ministry; and the same
general plan of administration, tho' by men of such op∣posite
characters, was still continued in the French
councils. The establishment of royal authority, the re∣duction
of the Austrian family, were pursued with ardor
and success; and every year brought an accession of force
and grandeur to the French monarchy. Not only
battles were gained, towns and fortresses taken; the ge∣nius
too of the nation seemed gradually to improve,
and to compose itself to the spirit of dutiful obedience
and of steddy enterprize. A Condé, a Turenne were
formed; and the troops animated by their valour, and
guided by their discipline, acquired every day a greater
ascendant over the Spaniards. All of a sudden, from
some intrigues of the court, and some discontents in the
courts of judicature, intestine commotions were excited,
and every thing relapsed into confusion. But these re∣bellions
of the French, neither ennobled by the spirit of
liberty, nor disgraced by the fanatical extravagancies,
which distinguished the British civil wars, were con∣ducted
with little bloodshed, and made but small im∣pression
on the minds of the people. Tho' seconded by
the force of Spain, and conducted by the heroic Condé,
the malecontents, in a little time, were either expelled
or subdued; and the French monarchy, having lost a
few of its conquests, returned again, with fresh vigor,
to the acquisition of new dominion.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="336"/>
THE Queen of England and her son, Charles, during
these commotions, passed most of their time at Paris;
and notwithstanding their near connexion of blood, re∣ceived
but few civilities, and still less support, from the
French court. Had the Queen regent been ever so much
inclined to assist the English Prince; the disorders of her
own affairs, for a long time, would have rendered such
intentions absolutely impracticable. The banished Queen
had a moderate pension assigned her; but it was so ill
payed, and her credit ran so low, that, one morning,
when the Cardinal de Retz waited on her, she informed
him, that her daughter, the Princess Henrietta, was ob∣liged
to lie abed, for want of a fire to warm her. To
such a condition was reduced, in the midst of Paris, a
Queen of England, and daughter of Henry the fourth of
France!</P>
<P>THE English Parliament, however, having assumed
the sovereignty of the state, resented the countenance,
cold as it was, which the French court gave to the un∣fortunate
Monarch. On pretence of injuries, of which
the English merchants complained, they issued letters of
reprisal upon the French; and Blake went so far as to
attack and seize a whole squadron of ships, which were
carrying supplies to Dunkirk, then closely besieged by
the Spaniards. That town, disappointed of these sup∣plies,
fell into the enemies hands. The court of France
soon found it requisite to change their measures. They
treated Charles with such affected indifference, that he
thought it more decent to withdraw, and to save him∣self
the shame of being desired to leave the kingdom.
He went first to Spaw, thence he retired to Cologne;
where he lived two years, on a small pension, about
6000 pounds a year, payed him by the French Mo∣narch,
and on some contributions sent him by his friends
in England. In the management of his family, he dis∣covered
a disposition to order and oeconomy; and his
<PB N="257" REF="337"/>
temper, cheerful, careless, and sociable, was more than
a sufficient compensation for that empire, of which his
enemies had bereaved him. Sir Edward Hyde, created
Lord-chancellor, and the Marquess of Ormond, were
his chief friends and confidents.</P>
<P>IF the French ministry had thought it prudent to bend
under the English parliament, they deemed it still more
necessary to pay deference to the Protector, when he
assumed the reins of government. Cardinal Mazarine,
by whom all the French councils were directed, was
artful and vigilant, supple and patient, false and in∣triguing;
desirous rather to prevail by dexterity than
violence, and placing his honour more in the final suc∣cess
of his measures than in the splendor and magnani∣mity
of the means which he employed. Cromwel, by
his imperious character, rather than by the advantage of
his situation, acquired an ascendant over this man; and
each proposal made by the Protector, however unreason∣able
in itself and urged with whatever insolence, met
with a ready compliance from the politic and timid car∣dinal.
Boardeaux was sent over to England as minis∣ter;
and every circumstance of respect was payed to the
daring usurper, who had embrued his hands in the blood
of his sovereign, a Prince so nearly related to the crown
of France. With indefatigable patience did Bourdeaux
conduct this negotiation, which Cromwel seemed en∣tirely
to neglect; and tho' privateers with English com∣missions,
committed daily ravages on the French com∣merce,
Mazarine was contented, in hopes of a fortu∣nate
issue, still to submit to these indignities<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. iii. p. 103, 619, 653.

royal family, and reduced to greater distress than

<PB N="258" REF="340"/>
the French monarchy, had been still more forward in
their advances to the prosperous parliament and pro∣tector.
Don Alonzo de Cardenas, the Spanish envoy,
was the first public minister, who recognized the autho∣rity
of the new republic; and in return of this civility,
Ascham was sent envoy into Spain by the parliament.
No sooner had this minister arrived in Madrid, than
some of the banished royalists, inflamed by that inve∣terate
hatred, which animated the English factions, broke
into his chamber, and murdered him together with his
secretary. Immediately, they took sanctuary in the
churches, and assisted by the general favour, which every
where attended the royal cause, were enabled, most of
them, to make their escape. Only one of the criminals
suffered death; and the parliament seemed to rest con∣tented
with this atonement.</P>
<P>SPAIN, at this time, assailed every where by vigorous
enemies from without, and labouring under many inter∣nal
disorders, retained nothing of her former grandeur,
except the haughty pride of her councils, and the ha∣tred
and jealousy of all her neighbours. Portugal had re∣volted,
and established its monarchy in the house of Bra∣ganza:
Catalonia, complaining of violated privileges,
had delivered itself over to France: Naples was shook
with popular convulsions: The Low Countries were in∣vaded
with superior forces, and seemed ready to change
their master: The Spanish infantry, antiently so for∣midable,
had been annihilated by Condé in the fields of
Rocroy: and tho' the same Prince, banished France,
sustained by his activity and valour, the falling fortunes
of Spain, he could only hope to protract, not prevent,
the ruin, with which that monarchy was visibly threat∣ned.</P>
<P>HAD Cromwel understood and regarded the interest
of his country, he would have supported the declining
<PB N="259" REF="341"/>
condition of Spain against the dangerous ambition of
France, and preserved that ballance of power, on which
the greatness and security of England so much depends.
Had he studied only his own interests, he would have
maintained an exact neutrality between those two great
monarchies; nor would he ever have hazarded his ill-acquired
and unsettled power, by provoking foreign
enemies, who might lend assistance to domestic faction,
and overturn his tottering throne. But his magnanimity
undervalued danger: His active disposition and avidity
of extensive glory, made him incapable of repose: And
as the policy of men is continually warped by their tem∣per,
no sooner was peace made with Holland, than he
began to deliberate what new enemy he should invade
with his victorious arms.</P>
<P>THE extensive dominion and yet extreme weakness of
Spain in the West Indies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Spain.</NOTE> the vigorous courage and
great naval power of England; were circumstances,
which, when compared, excited the ambition of the
enterprizing Protector, and made him hope, that he
might, by some gainful conquest, render for ever illus∣trious
that dominion, which he had assumed over his
country. Should he fail of these durable acquisitions,
the Indian treasures, which must every year cross the
ocean to reach Spain, were, he thought, a sure prey to
the English navy, and would support his military force,
without laying new burthens on the discontented peo∣ple.
From France a vigorous resistance must be ex∣pected:
No plunder, no conquests could be hoped for.
The progress of his arms, even if attended with success,
must there be slow and gradual; and the advantages ac∣quired,
however real, would be less striking to the igno∣rant
multitude, whom it was his interest to allure. The
royal family, so closely connected with the French mo∣narch,
might receive great assistance from that neigh∣bouring
kingdom; and an army of French protestants,

the most opposite factions against the present usurpa∣tion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See the account of the negotiations with France and Spain by Thurloe, Vol. i. p. 759.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE motives of policy were probably seconded by
his bigotted prejudices; as no human mind ever con∣tained
so strange a mixture of sagacity and absurdity as
that of this extraordinary personage. The Swedish al∣liance,
tho' much contrary to the interests of England,
he had contracted merely from his zeal for protestantism<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">He proposed to Sweden a general league and confederacy of all the pro∣testants. Whitelocke, p. 620.

and Sweden being closely connected with France, he
could not hope to maintain that consederacy, in which
he so much prided himself, should a rupture ensue be∣tween
England and this latter kingdom<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. i. p. 759.</NOTE>. The Hugo∣nots,
he expected, would meet with better treatment,
while he engaged in a close union with their sovereign<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.
And as the Spaniards were much more papists than the
French, were much more exposed to the old puritanical
hatred<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>, and had even erected the bloody tribunal of the
inquisition, whose rigors they had refused to mitigate,
on Cromwel's solicitation<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid. Don Alanzo said, that the Indian trade and the inquisition were his master's two eyes, and the Protector insisted upon the putting out both of them at once.</NOTE>; he hoped that a holy and

from heaven<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Carrington, p. 191.</NOTE>. A preacher likewise, inspired,

<P><PB N="261" REF="345"/>
ACTUATED equally by those bigotted, those ambiti∣ous,
and those interested motives, the Protector equip∣ped
two considerable squadrons; and while he was mak∣ing
these preparations, all the neighbouring nations, ig∣norant
of his intentions, remained in suspence, and
looked with anxious expectation on what side the storm
would discharge itself. One of the squadrons, consist∣ing
of thirty capital ships, was sent into the Mediterra∣nean
under Blake, whose fame was now spread over all
Europe. No English fleet, except during the Croisades,
had ever before sailed those seas; and from one extre∣mity
to the other, there was no naval force, Christian
or Mahometan, able to resist them. The Roman pon∣tiff,
whose weakness and whose pride, equally provoke
attacks, dreaded invasion from a power, which professed
the most inveterate enmity against him, and which
so little regulated its movements by the common motives
of interest and prudence. Blake, casting anchor before
Leghorn, demanded and obtained of the Duke of Tus∣cany
satisfaction for some losses, which the English com∣merce
had formerly sustained from him. He next sailed
to Algiers, and compelled the Dey to make peace, and
to restrain his pyratical subjects from all farther violences
on the English. He presented himself before Tunis,
and having made the same demands, the Dey of that re∣public
bade him look to the castles of Porto-Farino and
Goletta, and do his utmost. Blake needed not to be
rouzed by such a bravado: He drew his ships close up
to the castles, and tore them in pieces with his artillery.
He sent a numerous detachment of seamen in their long
boats into the harbour, and burned every ship which
lay there. This bold action, which its very temerity,
perhaps, rendered safe, was executed with very little
loss, and filled all that part of the world with the re∣nown
of English valour.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="346"/>
THE other squadron was not equally successful. It
was commanded by Pen, and carried on board 4000
men, under the command of Venables. About 5000
more joined them from Barbadoes and St. Christophers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jamaica con∣quered.</NOTE>
Both these officers were inclined to the King's service<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE>;
and it is pretended, that Cromwel was obliged to hurry
the soldiers on board, in order to prevent the execution
of a conspiracy, which had been formed among them,
in favour of the exiled family<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vita D. Berwici, p. 124.</NOTE>. The ill success of this
enterprize, may justly be ascribed, as much to the in∣judicious
contrivance of the Protector, who planned it,
as to the bad execution of the officers, by whom it was
conducted. The soldiers were the refuse of the whole
army: The forces inlisted in the West Indies were the
most profligate of mankind: Pen and Venables were of
very incompatible tempers: The troops were not fur∣nished
with arms fit for such an expedition: Their pro∣visions
were very defective both in quantity and quality:
All hopes of pillage, the best incentive to valour among
such men, were refused the soldiers and seamen: No
directions nor intelligence were given to conduct the
officers in their enterprize: And at the same time, they
were tied down to follow the advice of commissioners,
who extremely disconcerted them in all their projects<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burchet's Naval History. See also Carte's Collection, vol. ii. p. 46, 47. Thurloe, vol. iii. p. 505.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was agreed by the Admiral and General to attempt
St. Domingo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of April.</NOTE> the only place of strength in the island of
Hispaniola. On the approach of the English the Spa∣niards
in a fright deserted their houses, and fled into the
woods. Contrary to the opinion of Venables, the sol∣diers
were disembarked without guides ten leagues dis∣tant
from the town. They wandered four days through
the woods without provisions, and what was still more
intolerable in that sultry climate, without water. The
<PB N="263" REF="347"/>
Spaniards gathered courage, and attacked them. The Eng∣lish,
discouraged with the bad conduct of their officers,
and scarce alive from hunger, thirst, and fatigue, had
no spirit to resist. A very inconsiderable number of the
enemy put the whole army to rout, killed 600 of them,
and chaced the rest on board their vessels.</P>
<P>THE English commanders, in order to atone, if pos∣sible,
for this unprosperous attempt, bent their course
to Jamaica, which was surrendered to them without a
blow. Pen and Venables returned to England, and
were both of them sent to the Tower by the Protector,
who, though commonly master of his fiery temper, was
thrown into a violent passion at this disappointment. He
had made a conquest of much greater importance, than
he was himself at that time aware of; yet was it much
inferior to the vast projects, which he had formed. He
gave orders, however, to support it by men and money;
and that island has ever since remained in the hands of
the English; the chief acquisition which they owe to
the enterprizing spirit of Cromwel.</P>
<P>AS soon as the news of this enterprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1656.</NOTE> which was a
most unwarrantable violation of treaty, arrived in Eu∣rope,
the Spaniards declared war against England, and
seized all the ships and goods of English merchants, of
which they could make themselves masters. The Spa∣nish
commerce, so profitable to the nation, was cut off;
and near 1500 vessels, it is computed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 135. World's Mistake in Oliver Cromwel, in the Harl. Miscel. vol. i.</NOTE>, fell in a few
years into the hands of the enemy. Blake, to whom
Montague was now joined in command, after receiving
new orders, prepared himself for hostilities against the
Spaniards.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="348"/>
SEVERAL sea officers, having entertained scruples of
conscience with regard to the justice of the Spanish war,
threw up their commissions, and retired home<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 570. 589.</NOTE>. No
command, they thought, of their superiors could justify
a war, which was contrary to the principles of natural
equity, and which the civil magistrate had no right to
order. Individuals, they maintained, in resigning to
the public their natural liberty, could bestow on it only
what they themselves were possessed of, a right of per∣forming
lawful actions, and could invest it with no au∣thority
of commanding what is contrary to the decrees
of heaven. Such maxims, though they seem reasonable,
are perhaps too perfect for human nature, and must be
regarded as one effect, though of the most innocent and
even honourable kind, of that spirit, partly fanatical,
partly republican, which predominated in England.</P>
<P>BLAKE lay some time off Cadiz,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Success.</NOTE> in expectation of
intercepting the plate fleet, but was at last obliged, for
want of water, to make sail towards Portugal. Cap∣tain
Stayner, whom he had left on the coast with a
squadron of seven vessels, came in sight of the galleons,
and immediately set sail to pursue them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> The Spanish
admiral ran his ship ashore: Two others followed his
example: The English took two ships valued at near
two millions of pieces of eight. Two galleons were set
on fire; and the Marquess of Bajadox, Viceroy of Peru,
with his wife and his daughter, betrothed to the young
Duke of Medina Celi, were destroyed in them. The
Marquess himself might have escaped; but seeing these
unfortunate women, astonished with the danger, fall
in a swoon, and perish in the flames, he chose rather to
die with them than drag out a life, embittered with
the remembrance of these dismal scenes<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 433.</NOTE>. When the
treasures, gained by this enterprize, arrived at Ports∣mouth,
<PB N="265" REF="349"/>
the Protector, from a spirit of ostentation, or∣dered
them to be transported by land to London.</P>
<P>THE next action against the Spaniards was more glo∣rious,
though less profitable to the nation. Blake, hav∣ing
heard that a Spanish fleet of sixteen ships, much
richer than the former, had taken shelter in the Cana∣ries,
immediately made sail towards them. He found
them in the bay of Santa Cruz, disposed in a most for∣midable
posture. The bay was secured with a strong
castle, well fortified with cannon, besides seven forts in
several parts of it, all united by a line of communica∣tion,
manned with musqueteers. Don Diego Diagues,
the Spanish admiral, ordered all his smaller vessels to
moor close to the shore, and posted the larger galleons
farther off, at anchor, with their broadsides to the
sea.</P>
<P>BLAKE was rather animated than daunted with this
appearance. The wind seconded his courage, and
blowing full into the bay, in a moment brought him
among the thickest of his enemies. After a resistance
of four hours, the Spaniards yielded to the English va∣lour,
and abandoned their ships, which were set on
fire, and consumed with all their treasures. The
greatest danger still remained to the English. They lay
under the fire of the castles and all the forts, which must,
in a little time, have torn them in pieces. But the wind
suddenly shifting, carried them out of the bay; where
they left the Spaniards in astonishment at the happy te∣merity
of their audacious victors.</P>
<P>THIS was the last and greatest action of the gallant
Blake.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and death of admiral Blake.</NOTE> He was consumed with a dropsy and scurvy,

man, so zealous for a faction, was so much respected
and esteemed even by the opposite factions. He was by
principle an inflexible Republican; and the late usurpa∣tions,
amidst all the trust and caresses which he received
from the ruling powers, were thought to be very little
grateful to him. <HI>It is still our duty,</HI> he said to the sea∣men,
<HI>to fight for our country, into whatever hands the go∣vernment
may fall.</HI> Disinterested, generous, liberal;
ambitious only of true glory, dreadful only to his
avowed enemies; he forms one of the most perfect
characters of that age, and the least stained with those
errors and violences, which were then so predominant.
The Protector ordered him a pompous funeral at the
public charge: But the tears of his countrymen were
the most honourable panegyric on his memory.</P>
<P>THE conduct of the protector in foreign affairs, tho'
imprudent and impolitic, was full of vigor and enter∣prize,
and drew a consideration to his country, which,
since the reign of Elizabeth, it seemed to have totally
lost. The great mind of this successful usurper was in∣tent
on spreading the renown of the English name; and
while he struck mankind with astonishment at his extra∣ordinary
fortune, he seemed to ennoble, instead of de∣basing,
that people, whom he had reduced to subjec∣tion.
It was his boast, that he would render the name
of an Englishman as much feared and revered as ever
was that of a Roman; and as his countrymen found
some reality in these pretensions, their national vanity,
being gratified, made them bear with the more patience
all the indignities and calamities under which they la∣boured.</P>
<P>IT must also be acknowledged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Domestic administra∣tion of Cromwel.</NOTE> that the Protector, in
his civil and domestic administration, displayed as great
regard both to justice and clemency, as his usurped au∣thority,
derived from no law, and founded only on the
sword, could possibly permit. All the chief offices in the
<PB N="267" REF="351"/>
courts of judicature were filled with men of integrity:
Amidst the virulence of faction, the decrees of the
judges were upright and impartial: And to every man
but himself, and to himself, except where necessity re∣quired
the contrary, the law was the great rule of con∣duct
and behaviour. Vane and Lilburn, whose credit
with the republicans and levellers he dreaded, were in∣deed
for some time confined to prison: Cony, who re∣fused
to pay illegal taxes, was obliged by menaces to
depart from his obstinacy: High courts of justice were
erected to try those who had engaged in conspiracies and
insurrections against the Protector's authority, and
whom he could not safely commit to the verdict of ju∣ries.
But these irregularities were deemed inevitable
consequences of his illegal authority. And though of∣ten
urged by his officers, as is pretended<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, Life of Dr. Berwick, &amp;c.</NOTE>, to attempt
a general massacre of the royalists, he always with hor∣ror
rejected such sanguinary councils.</P>
<P>IN the army was laid the sole basis of the Protector's
power; and in managing them consisted the chief art
and delicacy of his government. The soldiers were held
in the most exact discipline; a policy, which both ac∣customed
them to obedience, and made them less hate∣ful
and burthensome to the people. He augmented their
pay; though the public necessities sometimes obliged
him to run in arrears to them. Their interests, they
were sensible, were closely united with those of their
General and Protector. And he entirely commanded
their affectionate regard, by his ability and success in
almost every enterprize, which he had hitherto under∣taken.
But all military government is precarious; much
more where it stands in opposition to civil establish∣ments;
and still more, where it encounters religious
prejudices. By the wild fanaticism, which he had nou∣rished
<PB N="268" REF="352"/>
in the soldiers, he had seduced them into mea∣sures,
for which, if openly proposed to them, they
would have entertained the utmost aversion. But this
same spirit rendered them more difficult to be governed,
and made their caprices terrible even to that hand which
directed their movements. So often taught, that the
office of King was an usurpation upon Christ, they were
apt to suspect a Protector not to be altogether compatible
with that divine authority. Harrison, tho' raised to the
highest dignity, and possessed entirely of Cromwel's con∣fidence,
became his most inveterate enemy as soon as he
established the authority of a single person, against which
he had always made such violent protestations. Over∣ton,
Rich, Okey, officers of great rank in the army,
were actuated with like principles, and Cromwel was
obliged to deprive them of their commissions. Their
influence, which was before thought unbounded among
the troops, seemed from that moment to be totally anni∣hilated.</P>
<P>THE more effectually to curb the enthusiastic and se∣ditious
spirit of the troops, Cromwel established a kind
of militia in the several counties. Companies of infan∣try
and cavalry were inlisted under proper officers, regu∣lar
pay distributed among them, and a resource by that
means provided both against the insurrections of the
royalists, and mutiny of the army.</P>
<P>RELIGION can never be deemed a point of small con∣sequence
in civil government: But during this period,
it may be regarded as the great spring of men's actions
and determinations. Tho' transported, himself, with
the most frantic whimsies, Cromwel had adopted a
scheme for regulating this principle in others which was
sagacious and politic. Being resolved to maintain a na∣tional
church, and yet determined neither to admit epis∣copacy
nor presbytery, he established a number of com∣missioners,
<PB N="269" REF="353"/>
under the name of <HI>Tryers,</HI> partly laymen,
partly ecclesiastics, some presbyterians, some indepen∣dants.
These presented to all livings, which were for∣merly
in the gift of the crown; they examined and ad∣mitted
such persons as received holy orders; and they in∣spected
the lives, doctrine and behaviour of all the clergy.
Instead of supporting that union between learning and
theology, which has so long been maintained in Europe,
these tryers embraced the latter principle in its full pu∣rity,
and made it the sole object of their examinations.
The candidates were no more perplexed with questions
concerning their progress in Greek and Roman erudi∣tion;
concerning their talent for profane arts and
sciences: The chief object of scrutiny regarded their
advances in grace, and fixing the critical moment of
their conversion.</P>
<P>WITH the pretended saints of all denominations
Cromwel was familiar and easy. Laying aside the state
of Protector, which, on other occasions, he well knew
how to maintain, he insinuated to them, that nothing
but necessity could ever induce him to invest himself
with it. He talked spiritually to them; he sighed, he
weeped, he canted, he prayed. He even entered with
them into an emulation of ghostly gifts; and these men,
instead of grieving to be outdone in their own way, were
proud, that his highness, by his princely example, had
dignified those practices in which they themselves were
daily occupied<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Cromwel followed, tho' but in part, the advice which he received from general Harrison, at the time when the intimacy and endearment most strongly subsisted betwixt them. “Let the waiting upon Jehovah,” said that military saint, “be the greatest and most considerable business you have every day <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reck<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it so, more than to eat, sleep, and council together. Run aside sometimes from your company, and get a word with the Lord. Why should not you have three or four precious souls always standing at your el∣bow, with whom you might now and then turn into a corner? I have found refreshment and mercy in such a way.”</P>
<P>Milton's State Papers, p. 12.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="354"/>
IF Cromwel could be said to adhere to any particular
form of religion, they were the independants who could
chiefly boast of his favour; and it may be affirmed, that
such pastors of that sect, as were not passionately ad∣dicted
to civil liberty, were all of them devoted to him.
The presbyterians also, being saved from the ravages of
the anabaptists and millenarians, and enjoying their
establishments and tythes, were not averse to his go∣vernment;
tho' he still entertained a great jealousy of
that ambitious and restless spirit, by which they were
actuated. He granted an unbounded liberty of con∣science,
to all but catholics and prelatists; and by that
means, he both attached the wild sectaries to his own
person, and employed them in curbing the domineering
spirit of the presbyterians. “I am the only man,” he
was often heard to say, “who has known how to sub∣due
that insolent sect which can suffer none but it∣self.”</P>
<P>THE protestant zeal, which possessed the presbyterians
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd independants, was highly gratified by the haughty
manner, in which the Protector so successfully supported
the persecuted protestants throughout all Europe. Even
the duke of Savoy, so remote a Prince, and so little ex∣posed
to the naval power of England, was obliged, by
the authority of France, to comply with his mediation,
and to tolerate the protestants of the vallies, against
whom that prince had commenced a furious persecution.
France itself was constrained to bear, not only with the
religion, but even in some instances, with the seditious
insolence of the Hugonots; and when that court ap∣plied
for a reciprocal toleration of the catholic religion
in England, the Protector, who arrogated in every thing
<PB N="271" REF="355"/>
the superiority, would hearken to no such proposal. He
had entered a project of instituting a college in imita∣tion
of that at Rome, for the propagation of the faith;
and his apostles, in zeal, tho' not in unanimity, had
certainly been a full match for the catholics.</P>
<P>CROMWEL retained the church of England in con∣straint;
tho' he permitted its clergy a little more liberty
than the republican parliament had formerly allowed.
He was pleased, that the superior lenity of his admini∣stration
should in every thing be remarked. He bridled
the royalists, both by the mercenary army which he re∣tained,
and by those secret spies, which he found means
to intermix in all their counsels. Manning being dis∣covered
and punished with death, he corrupted Sir Ri∣chard
Willis, who was much trusted by chancellor Hyde
and all the royalists; and by means of that man he was
let into every design and conspiracy of the party. He
could disconcert any project, by confining the persons
who were the actors in it; and as he restored them af∣terwards
to liberty, his severity passed only for the result
of general jealousy and suspicion. The secret source of
his intelligence remained still unknown and unsuspected.</P>
<P>CONSPIRACIES for an assassination he was chiefly
afraid of; these being designs, which no prudence nor
vigilance could evade. Colonel Titus, under the name
of Allen, had wrote a very spirited discourse, exhorting
every one to embrace this method of vengeance; and
Cromwel knew, that the inflamed minds of the royal
party were sufficiently disposed to put this doctrine in
practice against him. He openly told them, that assas∣sinations
were base and odious, and he never would com∣mence
hostilities by so shameful an expedient; but if
the first attempt or provocation came from them, he
would retaliate to the uttermost. He had instruments,
he said, whom he could employ; and he never would

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="272" REF="358"/>
desist, till he had totally exterminated the royal family.
This menace, more than all his guards, contributed to
the security of his person<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">About this time an accident had almost robbed the Protector of his li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and saved his enemies the trouble of all their machinations. Having got <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fine Friesland coach-horses as a present from the count of Oldenburg, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dertook for his amusement to drive them about Hyde-park; his secreta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Thurloe being in the coach.

He fell upon the pole, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dragged upon the ground for some time; a pistol, which he carried in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pocket, went off; and by that singular good fortune, which ever attended hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was taken up without any considerable hurt or bruise.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE was no point about which the Protector was
more sollicitous than to procure intelligence. This arti∣cle
alone, 'tis said, cost him sixty thousand pounds a
year. Postmasters, both at home and abroad, were,
many of them, in his pay: Carriers were searched or
bribed: Secretaries and clerks were corrupted: The
greatest zealots in all parties were often those who con∣veyed
private information to him: And nothing could
escape his vigilant enquiry. Such at least is the repre∣sentation
made by historians of Cromwel's administra∣tion:
But it must be confessed, that, if we may judge
by those volumes of Thurloe's papers, which have been
lately published, this affair, like many others, has been
greatly magnified. We scarce find by that collection,
that any secret councils of foreign states, except those
of Holland, which are not expected to be concealed,
were known to the Protector.</P>
<P>THE general behaviour and deportment of this man
who had been raised from a very private station, who
had passed most of his youth in the country, and who
was still constrained so much to frequent bad company<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was such as might befit the greatest monarch. He main∣tained
a dignity without either affectation or ostenta∣tion;
and supported with all strangers that high idea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="273" REF="359"/>
with which his great exploits and prodigious fortune
had impressed them. Among his antient friends, he
could relax himself; and by trifling and amusement,
jesting and making verses, he feared not the exposing
himself to their most familiar approaches<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Whitelocke, p. 647.</NOTE>. With others,
he sometimes pushed matters to the length of rustic buf∣foonery;
and he would amuse himself by putting burn∣ing
coals into the boots and hose of the officers, who
attended him<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bates.</NOTE>. Before the King's trial, a meeting was
agreed on between the chiefs of the republican party
and the general officers, in order to concert the model
of that free government, which they were to substitute,
in place of the monarchical constitution, now totally
subverted. After debates on this subject, the most im∣portant,
which could fall under the discussion of human
creatures, Ludlow tells us, that Cromwel, by way of
frolic, threw a cushion at his head; and when Ludlow
took up another cushion in order to return the compli∣ment,
the General ran down stairs, and had almost
broke his bones in the hurry. When the High Court
of Justice was signing the King's sentence, a matter, if
possible, still more serious, Cromwel taking the pen in
his hand, before he subscribed his name, bedaubed with
ink the face of Martin, who sat next him. And the
pen being delivered to Martin, he practised the same
frolic upon Cromwel<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tryal of the Regicides.</NOTE>. He frequently gave feasts to
his inferior officers; and when the meat was set upon
the table, a signal was given; the soldiers rushed in
upon them; and with much noise, tumult, and confu∣sion,
ran away with all the dishes, and disappointed the
officers of their expected meal<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bates.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST all the unguarded play and buffoonery of this
extraordinary personage, he took the opportunity of re∣marking
<PB N="274" REF="360"/>
the characters, designs, and weaknesses of men;
and he would sometimes push them, by an indulgence in
wine, to open to him the most secret recesses of their
bosom. Great regularity, however, and even austerity
of manners were always maintained in his court; and
he was careful never by any liberties to give offence to
the most rigid of the godly. Some state was upheld;
but with little expence, and without any splendor. The
nobility, tho' courted by him, kept at a distance, and
disdained to intermix themselves with those mean per∣sons,
who were the instruments of his government.
Without departing from oeconomy, he was generous to
those who served him; and he knew how to find out
and engage in his interests every man possessed of those
talents, which any particular employment demanded.
His generals, his admirals, his judges, his ambassadors,
were persons, who contributed, all of them, in their
several spheres, to the security of the Protector and to
the honour and interest of the nation.</P>
<P>UNDER pretence of uniting Scotland and Ireland in
one Commonwealth with England, he had reduced these
kingdoms to a total subjection; and he treated them en∣tirely
as conquered provinces. The civil administration
of Scotland was placed in a council, consisting mostly
of English, of which lord Broghill was president. Justice
was administred by seven judges, four of whom were
English. In order to curb the tyrannical nobility, he
both abolished all vassalage<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Whitelocke, p. 570.</NOTE> and revived the office of
justices of peace, which King James had introduced,
but was not able to support<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 57.</NOTE>. A long line of forts and
garrisons were maintained throughout the kingdom. An
army of 10,000 men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. vol. vi. p. 557.</NOTE> kept every thing in peace and
obedience, and neither the banditti of the mountains
<PB N="275" REF="361"/>
nor the bigots of the low countries could indulge their
inclination to turbulence and disorder. He courted the
presbyterian clergy; though he nourished that intestine
enmity which prevailed between the resolutioners and
protesters; and he found, that very little policy was
requisite to foster quarrels among theologians. He per∣mitted
no church assemblies, being sensible that from
thence had proceeded many of the past mischiefs. And
in the main, the Scots were obliged to acknowledge,
that never before, while they enjoyed their irregular,
factious liberty, had they attained so much happiness as at
present, when reduced to subjection under a foreign na∣tion.</P>
<P>THE Protector's administration of Ireland was much
more severe and violent. The government of that island
was first entrusted to Fleetwood, a notorious fanatic,
who had married Ireton's widow; then to Henry Crom∣wel,
second son to the Protector, a young man of an
amiable mild disposition, and not destitute of vigor and
capacity. Five millions of acres, forfeited either by the
popish rebellion or by the adherents of the King, were
divided, partly among the adventurers, who had advanced
money to the parliament, partly among the English sol∣diers,
who had arrears due to them. Examples of a more
sudden and violent change of property are scarce to be
found in any history. An order even passed to confine
all the native Irish to the province of Connaught, where
they would be shut up by rivers, lakes, and mountains,
and could not, it was hoped, be any longer dangerous
to the English government: But this barbarous and ab∣surd
policy, which, from an impatience of attaining
immediate security, must have depopulated all the other
provinces, and rendered the English estates of no value,
it was soon found impossible to reduce to practice.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="362"/>
CROMWEL began to hope, that by his administra∣tion,
attended with so much lustre and success abroad,
so much order and tranquillity at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> he had now ac∣quired
such authority as would enable him to meet the
representatives of the nation, and would assure him of
their dutiful compliance with his government. He there∣fore
summoned a parliament; but not trusting altogether
to the good will of the people, he used every art, which
his new model of representation allowed him to employ,
in order to influence the elections and fill the house with
his own creatures. Ireland, being entirely in the hands
of the army, chose none but such officers as were most
acceptable to him. Scotland showed the same compli∣ance;
and as the nobility and gentry of that kingdom
regarded their attendance on English parliaments as an
ignominious badge of slavery, it was, on that account,
more easy for the officers to prevail in the elections.
Notwithstanding all these precautions, the Protector still
found, that the majority would not be favourable to
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> He set guards, therefore, on the door, who per∣mitted
none to enter but such as produced a warrant from
his council; and the council rejected about a hundred,
who either refused a recognition of the Protector's go∣vernment,
or were on other accounts obnoxious to him.
These protested against so egregious a violence, subver∣sive
of all liberty; but every application for redress was
neglected both by the council and the parliament.</P>
<P>THE majority of the parliament, by means of these
arts and violences, were now at last either friendly to
the Protector, or resolved, by their compliance, to ad∣just,
if possible, this military government to their laws
and liberties. They voted a renounciation of all title in
Charles Stuart or any of his family; and this was the
first act, dignified with the appearance of national con∣sent,
which had ever had that tendency. Colonel Jeph∣son,
in order to found the inclinations of the house,
<PB N="277" REF="363"/>
ventured to move, that the parliament should bestow
the crown on Cromwel; and no surprize nor reluctance
was discovered on that occasion. When Cromwel af∣terwards
asked Jephson what induced him to make such
a motion, “As long,” said Jephson, “as I have the
honour to sit in parliament, I must follow the dic∣tates
of my own conscience, whatever offence I may
be so unfortunate as to give you.” “Get thee
gone,” said Cromwel, giving him a gentle blow on
the shoulder, get thee gone for a mad fellow as thou
art.”</P>
<P>IN order to pave the way to this advancement, for
which he so ardently longed, Cromwel resolved to sacri∣fice
his major-generals, whom he knew to be extremely
odious to the nation. That measure was also become
necessary for his own security. All government, purely
military, fluctuates perpetually between a despotic mo∣narchy
and a despotic aristocracy, according as the au∣thority
of the chief commander prevails, or that of the
officers next him in rank and dignity. The major-generals,
being possessed of so much distinct jurisdiction,
began to establish a separate title to power, and had ren∣dered
themselves formidable to the Protector himself;
and for this inconvenience, tho' he had not foreseen it,
he well knew, before it was too late, to provide a pro∣per
remedy. Claypole, his son-in-law, who possessed
entirely his confidence, abandoned them to the pleasure
of the house; and tho' the name was still retained, it
was agreed to abridge, or rather entirely annihilate, the
power of the major-generals.</P>
<P>AT last, a more formal motion was made by alderman
Pack, one of the city members, for investing the Pro∣tector
with the dignity of King. This motion, at first,
excited great disorder, and divided the whole house into
parties. The chief opposition came from the usual ad∣herents
<PB N="278" REF="364"/>
of the Protector, the major-generals and such
officers as depended on them. Lambert, a man of deep
intrigue and of great interest in the army, had long en∣tertained
the ambition of succeeding Cromwel in the
Protectorship; and he foresaw, if the monarchy was re∣stored,
that hereditary right would also be established,
and the crown be transmitted to the posterity of the
prince first elected. He pleaded, therefore, conscience;
and exciting all those civil and religious jealousies against
kingly government, which had been so industriously en∣couraged
among the soldiers, and which served them as
a pretence for so many violences, he formed a numerous
and still more formidable party against the motion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the motion was supported by
every one, who was more particularly devoted to the
Protector, and who hoped, by so acceptable a measure,
to pay court to the prevailing authority. Many persons
also, attached to their country, despaired of ever being
able to subvert the present illegal establishment, and
were desirous, by fixing it on antient foundations, to
induce the Protector, from views of his own safety, to
pay a regard to the antient laws and liberties of the
kingdom. Even the royalists imprudently joined in the
same measure; and hoped, that, when the question re∣garded
only persons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1657.</NOTE> not forms of government, no one
would any longer ballance between the antient royal
family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crown of∣fered to Cromwel.</NOTE> and an ignoble usurper, who, by blood, treason,
and perfidy, had made his way to the throne. The bill
was voted by a considerable majority; and a committee
was appointed to reason with the Protector, and to over∣come
those scruples, which he pretended against accept∣ing
so liberal an offer.</P>
<P>THE conference lasted for several days.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of April.</NOTE> The committee
urged, that all the statutes and customs of England were
founded on the supposition of regal authority, and could
not, without extreme violence, be adjusted to any other
<PB N="279" REF="365"/>
form of government: That a Protector, except during
the minority of a king, was a name utterly unknown to
the laws; and no man was acquainted with the extent
or limits of his authority: That if it was attempted to
define every part of his jurisdiction, many years, if not
ages, would be required for the execution of so compli∣cated
a work; if the whole power of the King was at
once transferred to him, the question was plainly about
a name, and the preference was undisputably due to
the antient title: That the English constitution was
more anxious concerning the form of government than
concerning the birthright of the first magistrate, and had
provided, by an express law of Henry VII. for the se∣curity
of those who act in defence of the King in be∣ing,
by whatever means he might have acquired posses∣sion:
That it was extremely the interest of all his High∣ness's
friends to seek the shelter of this statute; and even
the people in general were desirous of such a settlement,
and in all juries were with great difficulty induced to
give their verdict in favour of a Protector: That the
great source of all the late commotions, had been the
jealousy of liberty; and that a republic, together with
a Protector, had been established in order to provide far∣ther
securities for the freedom of the constitution; but
that by experience the remedy had been found insuffi∣cient,
even dangerous and pernicious; since every unde∣terminate
power, such as that of a Protector, must be
arbitrary; and the more arbitrary, as it was contrary to
the genius and inclination of the people.</P>
<P>THE difficulty consisted not in perswading Cromwel.
He was sufficiently convinced of the solidity of these rea∣sonings;
and his inclination, as well as judgement, was
intirely on the side of the committee. But how to bring
over the army to the same way of thinking was the question.
The office of King had been painted to them in such
<PB N="280" REF="366"/>
horrible colours, that there were no hopes of reconcil∣ing
them suddenly to it, even though bestowed upon
their general, to whom they were so much devoted. A
contradiction, open and direct, to all past professions
would make them pass, in the eyes of the whole na∣tion,
for the most shameless hypocrites, inlisted by no
other than mercenary motives in the cause of the most
perfidious traitor. Principles, such as they were, had
been encouraged in them by every consideration human
and divine; and though it was easy, where interest
concurred, to deceive them by the thinnest disguises, it
might be found dangerous at once to pull off the masque,
and show them in a full light the whole crime and
deformity of their conduct. Suspended between these
fears and his own most ardent desires, Cromwel pro∣tracted
the time, and seemed still to oppose the reason∣ings
of the committee; in hopes, that by artifice he
might be able to reconcile the refractory minds of the
soldiers to his new dignity.</P>
<P>WHILE the Protector argued so much in contradiction
both to his judgement and inclination, it is no wonder,
that his elocution, always confused, embarrassed, and
unintelligible, should be involved in tenfold darkness,
and discover no glimmering of common sense or reason.
An exact account of this conference remains, and may
be regarded as a great curiosity. The members of the
committee, in their reasonings, discover judgement,
knowlege, elocution: Lord Broghill in particular ex∣erts
himself on this memorable occasion. But what a
contrast, when we pass to the Protector's replies! After
so singular a manner does nature distribute her talents,
that, in a nation abounding with sense and learning, a
man, who, by superior personal merit alone, had made
his way to supreme dignity, and had even obliged the
parliament to make him an offer of the crown, was yet
<PB N="281" REF="367"/>

would justly be ashamed of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">We shall produce any passage at random: For his discourse is all of a piece. “I confess, for it behoves me to deal plainly with you, I must con∣fess, I would say, I hope, I may be understood in this, for indeed I must be tender what I say to such an audience as this; I say, I would be under∣stood, that in this argument I do not make parallel betwixt men of a dif∣ferent mind and a parliament, which shall have their desires.

But providence does so dispose. And though a man may impure his own folly and blindness to providence sinfully, yet it must be at my peril; the case may be that it is the providence of God, that doth lead men in darkness: I must need say, that I have had a great deal of experience of providence, and though it has no rule without or against the word, yet it is a very good expositor of the word in many cases.” <HI>Conference at White∣hall.</HI> The great defect in Oliver's speeches consists not in his want of elocu∣tion, but in his want of ideas.

<P>THE opposition, which Cromwel dreaded, was not
that which came from Lambert and his adherents,
whom he now regarded as his capital enemies, and
whom he was resolved, on the first occasion, to deprive
of all power and authority: It was that which he met
with in his own family, and from men, who, by inte∣rest

as well as inclination, were the most devoted to
him. Fleetwood had married his daughter: Desborow
his sister: Yet these persons, actuated by principle
alone, could, by no perswasion, artifice, or entreaty,
be induced to consent that their friend and patron
should be invested with regal dignity. They told him,
that, if he accepted of the crown, they would instantly
throw up their commissions, and never afterwards
would have it in their power to serve him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 261.</NOTE> Colonel
Pride procured a petition against the office of King,
signed by the majority of the officers, who were in Lon∣don
and the neighbourhood. Several persons, it was
said, had entered into an engagement to murder the
Protector within a few hours after he should have ac∣cepted
the offer of the parliament. Some sudden mutiny
in the army was justly dreaded. And upon the whole,
Cromwel, after the agony and perplexity of long doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He rejects it.</NOTE>
was at last obliged to refuse that crown, which the re∣presentatives
of the nation, in the most solemn manner,
had tendered to him. Most historians are inclined to
blame his choice: but he must be allowed to be the best
judge of his own situation. And in such complicated
subjects, the alteration of a very minute circumstance,
unknown to the spectator, will often be sufficient to
cast the ballance, and render a determination, which,
in itself, may be uneligible, very prudent, or even ab∣solutely
necessary to the actor. A dream or prophecy,
lord Clarendon mentions, which, he affirms, (and he
must have known the truth) was universally talked of
almost from the beginning of the civil wars, and long
before Cromwel was so considerable a person as to bestow
upon it any degree of probability. In this prophecy it
was foretold, that Cromwel should be the greatest man
in England, and would nearly, but never would fully<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="283" REF="371"/>
mount the throne. Such a prepossession probably arose
from the heated imagination either of himself or of his
followers; and as it might be one cause of the great
progress, which he had already made, it is not an un∣likely
reason, which may be assigned for his refusing at
this time any farther elevation. The parliament, when
the regal dignity was rejected by Cromwel, found
themselves obliged to retain the name of a Common∣wealth
and Protector; and as the government was hi∣therto
a manifest usurpation, it was thought proper to
sanctify it by a seeming choice of the people and their
representatives. Instead of the instrument of govern∣ment,
which was the work of the general officers alone,
an humble petition and advice was framed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humble pe∣tition and advice.</NOTE> and offered
to the Protector by the parliament. This was repre∣sented
as the great basis of the republican establishment,
regulating and limiting the powers of each member of
the constitution, and securing the liberty of the people
to the most remote posterity. By this deed, the autho∣rity
of Protector was in some particulars enlarged: In
others, it was considerably diminished. He had the
power of nominating his successor; he had a perpetual
revenue assigned him, a million a year for the fleet and
army, three hundred thousand pounds for the civil go∣vernment;
and he had authority to name another house,
who should enjoy their seats during life, and exercise
some functions of the former house of peers. But he
abandoned the power assumed in the intervals of parlia∣ment,
of framing laws with the consent of his council;
and he agreed, that no members of either house should
be excluded but by the consent of that house, of which
they were members. The other articles were in the
main the same as in the instrument of government. The
instrument of government Cromwel had formerly ex∣tolled
as the most perfect work of human invention:
He now represented it as a rotten plank, upon which
<PB N="282" REF="372"/>

<PB N="283" REF="373"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="284" REF="374"/>
no man could trust himself without sinking. Even the
humble petition and advice, which he extolled in its
turn, appeared so lame and imperfect, that it was found
requisite, this very session, to mend it by a supplement;
and after all, it may be regarded as a very crude and
undigested model of government. It was, however, ac∣cepted
for the deed of the whole people in the three united
nations; and Cromwel, as if his power had just com∣menced
from this popular consent, was anew inaugurated
in Westminster Hall, after the most solemn and most
pompous manner.</P>
<P>THE parliament having adjourned itself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th of June.</NOTE> the Pro∣tector
deprived. Lambert of all his commissions; but still
allowed him a considerable pension, of 2000 pounds a
year, as a bribe for his future, peaceable deportment.
Lambert's authority in the army, to the great surprize
of every body, was found immediately to expire with
the loss of his commission. Packer and some other offi∣cers,
whom Cromwel suspected, were also displaced.</P>
<P>RICHARD, eldest son to the Protector; was brought
to court, introduced into public business, and hence∣forth
regarded by many as his heir in the Protectorship;
though Cromwel sometimes employed the gross artifice
of flattering others with the hopes of the succession.
Richard was a person possessed of the most peaceable,
inoffensive, unambitious character; and had hitherto
lived contentedly in the country on a small estate, which
his wife had brought him. The little activity, which
he discovered, was always exerted to beneficent pur∣poses:
At the time of the King's trial, he had fallen on
his knees before his father, and had conjured him, by
all the ties of duty and humanity, to spare the life of that
monarch. Cromwel had two daughters unmarried: One
of them he now gave to the grandson and heir of his great
friend, the Earl of Warwick, with whom he had, in
<PB N="285" REF="375"/>
every fortune, preserved an uninterrupted intimacy and
correspondence: The other, he married to the viscount
Falconbridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1658.</NOTE> of family, formerly devoted to the royal
party. He was very ambitious of forming connexions
with the nobility; and it was one chief motive of his
desiring the title of King, that he might replace every
thing in its natural order, and restore to the antient fa∣milies,
that trust and honour, of which he now found
himself obliged, for his own preservation, to deprive
them.</P>
<P>THE parliament was again assembled; consisting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> as
in the times of monarchy, of two houses, the commons
and the other house. Cromwel, during the interval,
had sent writs to his house of peers, which consisted of
sixty members. They were composed of five or six an∣tient
peers, of several gentlemen of fortune and distinc∣tion,
and of some officers who had risen from the
meanest professions. None of the antient peers, how∣ever,
would deign to accept a feat, which they must
share with such companions as were assigned them. The
Protector endeavoured at first to maintain the appearance
of a legal magistrate. He removed the guards from the
door of both houses: But soon found how incom∣patible
liberty is with military usurpations. By bring∣ing
so great a number of his friends and adherents into
the other house, he had lost the majority among the na∣tional
representatives. In consequence of a clause in the
Humble Petition and Advice, the commons assumed a
power of re-admitting those members, whom the coun∣cil
had formerly excluded. Sir Arthur Hazelrig and
some others, whom Cromwel had created lords, rather
chose to take their seats with the commons. An un∣contestable
majority now declared themselves against the
Protector; and they refused to acknowledge the jurisdic∣tion
of that other house, which he had established. Even
<PB N="286" REF="376"/>
the validity of the Humble Petition and Advice was ques∣tioned;
as being voted by a parliament, which lay un∣der
force, and which was deprived by military violence
of a considerable number of its members. The Protec∣tor,
dreading combinations between the parliament and
the malecontents in the army, was resolved to allow no
leisure for the forming any conspiracy against him; and
with great expressions of anger and displeasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Febru∣ary.</NOTE> he dis∣solved
the parliament. When urged by Fleetwood and
others of his friends not to precipitate himself into this
rash measure, he swore by the living God, that they
should not sit a moment longer. These distractions at
home were not able to take off the Protector's attention
from foreign affairs; and in all his measures he pro∣ceeded
with equal vigour and enterprize, as if secure of
the duty and attachment of all the three kingdoms. His
alliance with Sweden he still supported; and he endea∣voured
to assist that crown in its successful enterprizes,
for reducing all its neighbours to subjection, and ren∣dering
itself absolutely master of the Baltic. As soon
as Spain declared war against him, he concluded a peace
and an alliance with France, and united himself in all
his councils with that potent and ambitious kingdom.
Spain, having long courted in vain the friendship of
the successful usurper, was reduced at last to apply to
the unfortunate Prince. Charles formed a league with
Philip, removed his small court to Bruges in the Low
Countries, and raised four regiments of his own sub∣jects,
whom he employed in the Spanish service. The
Duke of York, who had, with great applause, served
some campaigns in the French army, and who had me∣rited
the particular esteem of Marshal Turenne, now
joined his brother, and continued to seek military expe∣rience
under Don John of Austria and the Prince of
Condé. The scheme of foreign politics, adopted by
the Protector, was highly imprudent, but was suitab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="287" REF="377"/>
to that magnanimity and enterprize, with which he
was so signally endowed. He was particularly desirous
of conquest and dominion on the continent<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">He aspired to get possession of Elsinore and the passage of the Sound. See <HI>World's Mistake in Oliver Cromwel.</HI> He also endeavoured to get possession of Bremen. Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 478.</NOTE>; and he
sent over into Flanders six thousand men under Rey∣nolds,
who joined the French army commanded by
Turenne. In the former campaign, Mardyke was
taken, and put into their hands. Early this campaign,
siege was laid to Dunkirk; and when the Spanish army
advanced to relieve it, the combined armies of France
and England marched out of their trenches, and fought
the battle of the Dunes, where the Spaniards were
totally defeated<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">It was remarked by the pretended saints of that time, that the battle was fought on a day which was held for a fast in London, so that as Fleetwood said (Thurloe, vol. vii. p. 159) while we were praying, they were fight∣ing; and the Lord hath given a signal answer. The Lord has not only owned us in our work there, but in our waiting upon him in a way of prayer, which is indeed our old experienced approved way in all streights and difficulties. Cromwel's letter to Blake and Montague, his brave admirals, is remarkable for the same spirit. Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 744. You have, says he, as I verily believe and am perswaded, a plentiful stock of prayers going for you daily, sent up by the soberest and most approved ministers and chris∣tians in this nation, and, notwithstanding some discouragements, very much wrestling of faith for you, which are to us, and I trust will be to you, mat∣ter of great encouragement. But notwithstanding all this, it will be good for you and us to deliver up ourselves and all our affairs to the disposition of our all-wise Father, who not only out of prerogative, but because of his good∣ness, wisdom and truth, ought to be resigned unto by his creatures, especially those who are children of his begetting through the spirit, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The valour of the English was much
remarked on this occasion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunkirk taken.</NOTE> Dunkirk, being soon after
surrendered, was by agreement delivered to Cromwel.
He committed the government of that important place
to Lockart, a Scotsman of ability, who had married his
niece, and was his ambassador in the court of France.</P>
<P>THIS acquisition was regarded by the Protector as the
means only of obtaining farther advantages. He was re∣solved

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="287" REF="379"/>

to concert measures with the French court for the
final conquest and partition of the Low Countries<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 762.</NOTE>. Had he lived much longer, and maintained his autho∣rity
in England, so chimerical or rather so dangerous a
project, would certainly have been reduced to execu∣tion.
And this first and principal step towards Univer∣sal
Monarchy, which France, during a whole century,
has never yet been able, by an infinite expence of
blood and treasure, fully to effectuate, had at once
been accomplished by the enterprizing, though unskil∣ful
politics of Cromwel.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions, great demonstrations of
mutual friendship and regard passed between the French
King and the Protector. Lord Falconbrige, Cromwel's
son-in-law, was sent over to Louis, then in the camp
before Dunkirk; and was received with the same re∣gard,
which is usually payed to foreign princes by the
French court<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 151. 158.</NOTE>. Mazarine sent to London his nephew
Mancini, along with the Duke of Crequi; and ex∣pressed
his regret, that his urgent affairs should deprive
him of the honour, which he had long wished for, of
paying, in person, his respects to the greatest man in
the world<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">In reality the cardinal had not entertained so high an idea of Cromwel.

<P>THE Protector reaped little satisfaction from the suc∣cess
of his arms abroad: The situation in which he
stood at home kept him in perpetual uneasiness and in∣quietude.
His administration, so expensive both by mi∣litary
enterprizes and secret intelligence, had exhausted
his revenue, and involved him in a considerable debt.
The royalists, he heard, had renewed their conspiracies,
for a general insurrection; and Ormond was secretly
<PB N="289" REF="381"/>
come over with a view of concerting measures for the
execution of this project. Lord Fairfax, Sir William
Waller, and many heads of the presbyterians, had se∣cretly
entered into the engagement. Even the army
was infected with the general spirit of discontent, and
some sudden and dangerous eruption was every moment
to be dreaded from them. No hopes remained, after
his violent breach with the last parliament, that he
would ever be able to establish, with general consent, a
legal settlement, or temper the military with the mix∣ture
of any civil authority. All his arts and policy were
exhausted; and having so often, by fraud and false pre∣tences,
deceived every party, and almost every indivi∣dual,
he could no longer hope, by repeating the same
professions, to meet with equal confidence and regard.</P>
<P>HOWEVER zealous the royalists, their conspiracy took
not effect: Willis discovered the whole to the Protector.
Ormond was obliged to fly, and he deemed himself for∣tunate
to have escaped so vigilant an administration.
Great numbers were thrown into prison. An high
court of justice was anew erected for the trial of such
of the criminals, whose guilt was most apparent. Not∣withstanding
the recognition of his authority by the last
parliament, the Protector could not, as yet, trust to an
unbyassed jury. Sir Henry Slingsby, Dr. Huet, were
condemned and beheaded. Mordaunt, brother to the
Earl of Peterborow, very narrowly escaped. The num∣bers
for his condemnation and his acquital were equal;
and just as the sentence was pronounced in his favour,
Colonel Pride, who was resolved to condemn him,
came into the court. Ashton, Storey, and Bestley
were hanged in different streets of the city.</P>
<P>THE conspiracy of the Millenarians in the army
struck Cromwel with still greater apprehensions. Har∣rison
and the other discarded officers of that party could
not remain at rest. Stimulated equally by revenge, by
<PB N="290" REF="382"/>
ambition, and by conscience, they still harboured in
their mind some desperate project; and there wanted
not officers in the army, who, from like motives, were
disposed to second all their undertakings. The levellers
and agitators had been encouraged by Cromwel to inter∣pose
with their advice in all political deliberations; and
he had even pretended to honour many of them with
his most intimate friendship, while he conducted his
daring enterprizes against the King and the parliament.
It was an usual practice with him, in order to familia∣rize
himself the more with the agitators, who were com∣monly
corporals or serjeants, to take them to bed with
him, and there, after prayers and exhortations, to dis∣cuss
together their projects and principles, political as
well as religious. Having assumed the dignity of Pro∣tector,
he excluded them from all his councils, and
had neither leisure nor inclination to indulge them any
farther in their wonted familiarities. Among those who
were enraged at this alteration was Sexby; an active
agitator, who now employed against him all that restless
industry which had formerly been exerted in his favour.
He even went so far as to enter into a negotiation with
Spain; and Cromwel, who knew the distempers of the
army, was justly afraid of some mutiny, to which a
day, an hour, an instant, might provide leaders.</P>
<P>OF assassinations likewise he was apprehensive, from
the zealous spirit, which actuated the soldiers. Sinder∣come
had undertaken to murder him; and by the most
unaccountable accidents had hitherto been prevented
from executing his bloody purpose. His design was dis∣covered;
but the Protector could never find the bottom
of the enterprize, nor detect any of his accomplices.
He was tried by a jury; and notwithstanding the gene∣ral
odium attending that crime, notwithstanding the
clear and full proof of his guilt, so little conviction
prevailed of the Protector's right to the supreme govern∣ment,
<PB N="291" REF="383"/>
it was with the utmost difficulty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 53.</NOTE> that this con∣spirator
was condemned. When every thing was pre∣pared
for his execution, he was found dead; from poi∣son,
as is supposed, which he had voluntarily taken.</P>
<P>THE Protector might better have supported those
fears and apprehensions, which the public distempers
occasioned, had he enjoyed any domestic satisfaction, or
possessed any cordial friend of his own family, in whose
bosom he could safely have unloaded his anxious and
corroding cares. But Fleetwood, his son-in-law, actu∣ated
with the wildest zeal, began to estrange himself
from him; and was enraged to discover, that Cromwel,
in all his enterprizes, had entertained views of promot∣ing
his own grandeur, more than of encouraging piety
and religion, of which he made such fervent professions.
His eldest daughter, married to Fleetwood, had adopted
republican principles so vehement, that she could not with
patience behold power lodged in a single person, even in
her indulgent father. His other daughters were no less
prejudiced in favour of the royal cause, and regreted
the violences and iniquities, into which, they thought,
their family had so unhappily been transported. But
above all, the sickness of Mrs. Claypole, his peculiar
favorite, a lady endued with every humane virtue and
amiable accomplishment, depressed his anxious mind,
and poisoned all his enjoyments. She had entertained
an high regard for Dr. Huet, lately executed; and be∣ing
refused his pardon, the melancholy of her temper,
encreased by her distempered body, had prompted her to
lament to her father all his sanguinary measures, and
urge him to compunction for those heinous crimes, into
which his fatal ambition had betrayed him. Her death,
which followed soon after, gave new edge to every
word, which she had uttered.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="384"/>
ALL composure of mind was now for ever fled from
the Protector: He found, that the grandeur, which he
had attained with so much guilt and courage, could
not ensure him that tranquillity, which it belongs to
virtue alone, and moderation fully to ascertain. Over∣whelmed
with the load of public affairs, dreading per∣petually
some fatal accident in his distempered govern∣ment,
seeing nothing around him but treacherous friends
or enraged enemies, possessing the confidence of no
party, resting his title on no principle, civil or religious,
his power he found to depend on so delicate a poize of
factions and interests, as the smallest event was able,
without any preparation, in a moment to overturn.
Death too, which, with such signal intrepidity, he had
braved in the field, being incessantly threatened by the
poniards of fanatical or interested assassins, was ever pre∣sent
to his terrified apprehensions, and haunted him in
every scene of business or repose. Each action of his
life betrayed the terrors under which he laboured. The
aspect of strangers was uneasy to him: With a piercing
and anxious eye he surveyed every face, to which he
was not daily accustomed. He never moved a step with∣out
strong guards attending him: He wore armour un∣der
his cloaths, and farther secured himself by offensive
weapons, a sword, falchion, and pistols, which he al∣ways
carried about him. He returned from no place
by the direct road, or by the same way which he went.
Every journey he performed with hurry and precipita∣tion.
Seldom he slept above three nights together in the
same chamber: And he never let it be known before∣hand
what chamber he intended to choose, nor entrusted
himself in any, which was not provided with backdoors,
at which sentinels were carefully placed. Society terri∣fied
him, while he reflected on his numerous, unknown,
and implacable enemies: Solitude astonished him, by
withdrawing that protection, which he found so neces∣sary
for his security.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="385"/>
HIS body also, from the contagion of his anxious
mind, began to be affected; and his health seemed very
sensible to decline. He was seized with a slow fever,
which changed into a tertian ague.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sickness of the Protec∣tor.</NOTE> For the space of a
week, no dangerous symptoms appeared; and in the
intervals of the fits he was able to walk abroad. At
length, the fever encreased, and he himself began to
entertain some thoughts of death, and to cast his eye
towards that future existence, whose idea had once
been intimately present to him; though since, in the
hurry of affairs, and the shock of wars and factions, it
had, no doubt, been considerably obliterated. He ask∣ed
Goodwin, one of his preachers, if the doctrine was
true, that the elect could never fall or suffer a final re∣probation.
“Nothing more certain,” replied the
preacher. “Then am I safe,” said the Protector: “For
I am sure that once I was in a state of grace.”</P>
<P>HIS physicians were sensible of the perilous condition,
to which his distemper had reduced him: But his chap∣lains,
by their prayers, visions, and revelations, so
buoyed up his hopes, that he began to believe his life
out of all danger. A favourable answer, it was pre∣tended,
had been returned by heaven to the petitions of
all the godly; and he relied on their asseverations much
more than on the opinion of the most experienced phy∣sicians.
“I tell you,” he cried with confidence to the
latter, “I shall not die of this distemper: I am well
assured of my recovery. It is promised by the Lord,
not only to my supplications, but also to that of men
who hold a stricter commerce and more intimate cor∣respondence
with him. Ye may have skill in your
profession; but nature can do more than all the phy∣sicians
in the world, and God is far above nature<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bates: See also Thurloe, vol. vii. p. 355. 416.</NOTE>.”
Nay, to such a degree of madness did their enthusiastic
<PB N="294" REF="386"/>
assurances mount, that upon a fast day, which was ob∣served,
on his account, both at Hampton Court and at
Whitehall, they did not so much pray for his health, as
give thanks for the undoubted pledges, which they had
received of his recovery. He himself was overheard of∣fering
up his addresses to heaven; and so far had the il∣lusions
of fanaticism prevailed over the plainest dictates
of natural morality, that he assumed more the character
of a mediator, in interceding for his people, than that of
a criminal, whose atrocious violation of social duty had,
from every tribunal, human and divine, merited the se∣verest
vengeance.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE all the symptoms began to wear a more
fatal aspect; and the physicians were obliged to break
silence, and to declare that the Protector could not sur∣vive
the next fit, with which he was threatened. The
council was alarmed. A deputation was sent to know
his will with regard to his successor. His senses were
gone, and he could not now express his intentions. They
asked him whether he did not mean, that his eldest son,
Richard, should succeed him in the Protectorship. A
simple affirmative was, or seemed to be extorted from
him. Soon after, on the 3d of September, that very
day, which he had always considered as the most fortu∣nate
to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death,</NOTE> he expired. A violent tempest, which
immediately succeeded his death, served as a subject of
discourse to the vulgar. His partizans, as well as his

<P>THE writers, attached to the memory of this won∣derful
person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and charac∣ter.</NOTE> make his character, with regard to abili∣ties,
bear the air of the most extravagant panegyric:
His enemies form such a representation of his moral qua∣lities
as resembles the most virulent invective. Both of
<PB N="295" REF="387"/>
them, it must be confessed, are supported by such strik∣ing
circumstances in his conduct and fortune as bestow
on their representation a great air of probability.

that a person, of private birth and education, no for∣tune,

the courage to attempt and the abilities to execute so
extraordinary a design as the subverting one of the
most antient and best established monarchies in the

to put his Prince and master to an open and infamous
death? Should banish that numerous and strongly

inheritance of his father, and be as noble and liberal
in the spending of them? And lastly (for there is no
end of enumerating every particular of his glory)
with one word bequeath all this power and splendor
to his posterity? Die possessed of peace at home and
triumph abroad? Be buried among kings, and with
more than regal solemnity? And leave a name be∣hind
him not to be extinguished but with the
whole world; which as it was too little for his
praise, so might it have been for his conquests, if the
short line of his mortal life could have stretched out
to the extent of his immortal designs?”</P>
<P>MY intention is not to disfigure this picture, drawn
by so masterly a hand: I shall only endeavour to re∣move
from it somewhat of the marvellous; a circum∣stance
which, on all occasions, gives much ground for
doubt and suspicion. It seems to me, that the circum∣stance
of Cromwel's life, in which his abilities are prin∣cipally
discovered, is his rising from a private station, in
opposition to so many rivals, so much advanced before
him, to a high command and authority in the army.
His great courage, his signal military talents, his emi∣nent
dexterity and address, were all requisite for this im∣portant
acquisition. Yet will not this promotion appear
the effect of supernatural abilities, when we consider,
that Fairfax himself, a private gentleman, who had not
the advantage of a seat in parliament, had, thro' the same
steps, attained even a superior rank, and, if indued with
<PB N="297" REF="391"/>
common capacity and penetration, had been able to re∣tain
it. To incite such an army to rebellion against the
parliament, required no uncommon art or industry: To
have kept them in obedience had been the more difficult
enterprize. When the breach was once formed be∣tween
the military and civil powers, a supreme and ab∣solute
authority, from that moment is devolved on the
general; and if he is afterwards pleased to employ arti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice
or policy, it may be regarded, on most occasions,
as great condescension, if not as a superfluous caution.
That Cromwel was ever able really to blind or over-reach,
either the King or the republicans, does not ap∣pear:
As they possessed no means of resisting the force
under his command, they were glad to temporize with
him, and, by seeming to be deceived, wait for oppor∣tunities
of freeing themselves from his dominion. If
he seduced the military fanatics, it is to be considered,
that their interest and his evidently concurred, that their
ignorance and low education exposed them to the grossest
imposition, and that he himself was at bottom as frantic
an enthusiast as the worst of them, and, in order to ob∣tain
their confidence, needed but to display those vulgar
and ridiculous habits, which he had early acquired, and
on which he set so high a value. An army is so for∣cible,
and at the same time so coarse a weapon, that
any hand which wields it, may, without much dexte∣rity,
perform any operation, and attain any ascendant
in human society.</P>
<P>THE domestic administration of Cromwel, though it
discovers great ability, was conducted without any plan
either of liberty or arbitrary power: Perhaps, his diffi∣cult
situation admitted of neither. His foreign enter∣prizes,
though full of intrepidity, were pernicious to
national interest, and seem more the result of impetuous
fury or narrow prejudices, than of cool foresight and
deliberation. An eminent personage however, he was
<PB N="298" REF="392"/>
in many respects, and even a superior genius; but un∣equal
and irregular in his operations. And though not
defective in any talent, except that of elocution, the
abilities, which in him were most admirable, and which
most contributed to his marvellous success, were the
magnanimous resolution of his enterprizes, and his pe∣culiar
dexterity in discovering the characters, and prac∣tising
on the weaknesses of mankind.</P>
<P>IF we survey the moral character of Cromwel with
that indulgence, which is due to the blindness and in∣firmities
of the human species, we shall not be inclined
to load his memory with such violent reproaches as those
which his enemies usually throw upon it. Amidst the
passion and prejudices of that time, that he should pre∣fer
the parliamentary to the royal cause, will not appear
very extraordinary; since, even at present, many men
of sense and knowledge are disposed to think, that the
question with regard to the justice of the quarrel may
be regarded as very doubtful and ambiguous. The mur∣der
of the King, the most atrocious of all his actions,
was to him covered under a mighty cloud of republican
and fanatical illusions; and it is not impossible, that he
might believe it, as many others did, the most merito∣rious
action, which he could perform. His subsequent
usurpation was the effect of necessity, as well as of am∣bition;
nor is it easy to see, how the various factions
could at that time have been restrained, without a mix∣ture
of military and arbitrary authority. The private
deportment of Cromwel, as a son, a husband, a father,
a friend, is exposed to no considerable censure, if it does
not rather merit praise. And upon the whole, his cha∣racter
does not appear more extraordinary and unusual
by the mixture of so much absurdity with so much pe∣netration,
than by his tempering such violent ambition
and such enraged fanaticism with so much regard to jus∣tice
and humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="393"/>
CROMWEL was in the fifty-ninth year of his age
when he died. He was of a romantic frame of body,
and of a manly, though not an agreeable aspect. He
lest only two sons, Richard and Henry; and three
daughters; one married to General Fleetwood, another
to Lord Falconbridge, a third to Lord Rich. His fa∣ther
died when he was young. His mother lived till
after he was Protector; and, contrary to her orders, he
buried her with great pomp in Westminster Abbey. She
could not be persuaded, that his power or person was
ever in security. At every noise, which she heard, she
exclaimed, that her son was murdered; and was never
satisfied that he was alive, if she did not receive frequent
visits from him. She was a decent woman; and by her
frugality and industry had raised and educated a nume∣rous
family upon a small fortune. She had even been
obliged to set up a brewery at Huntington, which she
managed to good advantage. Hence Cromwel, in the
invectives of that age, is often stigmatized with the
name of the Brewer. Ludlow, by way of insult, men∣tions
the great accession, which he would receive to his
royal revenues upon his mother's death, who possessed a
jointure of sixty pounds a year upon his estate. She
was of a good family, of the name of Stuart; remotely
allied, as is by some supposed, to the royal family.</P>

<P>ALL the arts of Cromwel's policy had been so
often practised,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXII.</NOTE> that they began to lose their ef∣fect;
and his authority, instead of being confirmed by
time and success, seemed every day to become more un∣certain
and precarious. His friends the most closely
connected with him, and his counsellors the most trusted,
were entering into cabals against his authority; and with
all his penetration into the characters of men, he could
not find any ministers, on whom he could rely. Men
of strict probity and honour, he knew, would not sub∣mit
to be instruments of an usurpation, violent and il∣legal:
Those, who were free from the restraint of prin∣ciple,
might betray, for interest, that cause, in which,
from no better motives, they had inlisted themselves.
Even those, on whom he conferred any favour, never
esteemed the recompence sufficient for the sacrifices,
which they made to obtain it: Whoever was refused
<PB N="301" REF="395"/>
any demand, justified his anger by the specious colours
of conscience and of duty. Such difficulties surrounded
the Protector, that his dying at so critical a time, is
deemed by many the most fortunate circumstance that
ever attended him; and it was thought that all his cou∣rage
and dexterity could not much longer have extended
his usurped administration.</P>
<P>BUT when that potent hand was removed, which
conducted the government, every one expected a sudden
dissolution of the unweildy and ill-jointed fabric. Ri∣chard,
a young man of no experience, educated in the
country, accustomed to a retired life, unacquainted
with the officers and unknown to them, recommended
by no military exploits, endeared by no familiarities,
could not long, it was thought, maintain that authority,
which his father had acquired by so many valorous at∣chievements,
and such signal successes. And when it
was observed, that he possessed only the virtues of pri∣vate
life, which in his situation were so many vices;
that indolence, incapacity, irresolution attended his fa∣cility
and good nature; the various hopes of men were
excited by the expectation of some great event or revo∣lution.
For some time, however, the public was dis∣appointed
in this opinion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard ac∣knowleged Protector.</NOTE> The council recognized the
succession of Richard: Fleetwood, in whose favour, it
was supposed, Cromwel had formerly made a will, re∣nounced
all claim or pretension to the Protectorship:
Henry, Richard's brother, who governed Ireland with
great popularity, ensured him the obedience of that
kingdom: Monk, whose authority was well established
in Scotland, being much attached to his family, im∣mediately
proclaimed the new Protector: The army,
every where, the fleet, acknowleged his title: Above
ninety addresses, from the counties and most consider∣able
corporations, congratulated him on his accession,
<PB N="302" REF="396"/>
in all the terms of dutiful allegiance: Foreign ministers
were forward in paying him the usual compliments:
And Richard, whose moderate, unambitious character,
never would have led him to contend for empire, was
tempted to accept of so rich a succession, which seemed
to be tendered to him, by the consent of all man∣kind.</P>
<P>IT was found necessary to call a parliament, in order
to furnish supplies, both for the ordinary administra∣tion,
and for fulfilling those engagements with foreign
Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> particularly Sweden, into which the last Pro∣tector
had entered. In hopes of obtaining greater in∣fluence
on elections, the antient right was restored to
all the small burroughs; and the counties were allowed
no more than their accustomed members.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1659.</NOTE> The House
of Peers or the other House consisted of the same per∣sons,
who had been nominated by Oliver.</P>
<P>ALL the commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> at first, signed without hesitation
an engagement not to alter the present government.
They next proceeded to examine the humble petition
and advice; and after great opposition and many vehe∣ment
disputes, it was, at last, with much difficulty, car∣ried
by the court-party to confirm it. An acknowlege∣ment
too of the authority of the other house was ex∣torted
from them; tho' it was resolved not to treat this
house of peers with any greater respect than they should
return to the commons. A declaration was also made,
that the establishment of the other house should no way
prejudice the right of such of the antient peers as had,
from the beginning of the war, adhered to the parlia∣ment.
In all parliamentary transactions, the opposition
among the commons was so considerable, and the de∣bates
were so prolonged, as much retarded all busines<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and gave great alarm to the partizans of the young
Protector.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="397"/>
BUT there was another quarter from which greater
dangers were justly apprehended. The most consider∣able
officers of the army, and even Fleetwood, brother∣in-law
to the Protector, were entering into cabals against
him. No character in human society is more dangerous
than that of the fanatic; because, if attended with weak
judgment, he is exposed to the suggestions of others;
if supported by more discernment, he is entirely go∣verned
by his own illusions, which sanctify his most
selfish views and passions. Fleetwood was of the for∣mer
species; and being extremely addicted to a republic
and even to the fifth monarchy or dominion of the saints,
it was easy for those, who had insinuated themselves
into his confidence, to instil disgusts against the dig∣nity
of Protector. The whole republican party in the
army, which were still considerable, Fitz, Mason, Moss,
Farley, united themselves to that general. The officers
too of the same party, whom Cromwel had dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arded,
Overton, Ludlow, Rich, Okey, Alured, began to ap∣pear,
and to recover that authority, which had been
only for a time suspended. A party likewise, who sound
themselves eclipsed in Richard's favour, Sydenham, Kel∣sey,
Berry, Haines, joined the cabal of the others.
Even Desborow, the Protector's uncle, lent his autho∣rity
to that faction. But above all, the intrigues of
Lambert, who was now rouzed from his retreat, in∣flamed
all these dangerous humours, and threatened the
nation with some great convulsion. All the discontented
officers established their meetings at Fleetwood's lodg∣ings;
and because he dwelt in Wallingford-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabal of Wallingford House.</NOTE> the
party received a denomination from that place.</P>
<P>RICHARD, who possessed neither resolution nor pene∣tration,
was prevailed with to give an unguarded con∣sent
for calling a council of general officers, who might
make him proposals, as they pretended, for the good of the
<PB N="304" REF="398"/>
army. No sooner were they assembled than they voted
a remonstrance. They there lamented, that <HI>the good old
cause,</HI> as they termed it, that is, the cause, for which
they had engaged against the King, was entirely neg∣lected;
and they proposed as a remedy, that the whole
military power, the command of the armies, should be
entrusted to some person, in whom they might all con∣fide.
The city militia, influenced by two aldermen;
Tichburn and Ireton, expressed the same resolution of
adhering to <HI>the good old cause.</HI></P>
<P>THE Protector was very justly alarmed at those move∣ments
among the officers. The persons, in whom he
chiefly confided, were all of them, excepting Broghill,
men of civil characters and professions; Fiennes, Thur∣loe,
Whitlocke, Wolseley; who could only assist him
with their advice and opinion. He possessed none of
those arts, which were proper to gain an enthusiastic
army. Murmurs being thrown out against some pro∣motions,
which he had made, <HI>Would you have me,</HI> said
he, <HI>prefer none but the godly? Here is Dick Ingoldsby,</HI> con∣tinued
he, <HI>who can neither pray nor preach; yet will I trust
him before ye all</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ludlow.</NOTE>. This imprudence gave great offence
to the pretended saints. The other qualities of the Pro∣tector
were laudable: He was of a gentle, humane, and
generous disposition. Some of his party offering to put
an end to these intrigues by the death of Lambert, if he
would give them authority, he declared, that he would
not purchase power or dominion by such sanguinary
measures.</P>
<P>THE parliament was no less alarmed at the military
cabals. They voted, that there should be no meeting
or general council of officers without the Protector's
consent, or by his orders. This vote brought affairs
immediately to a rupture. The officers hastened to Ri∣chard,
<PB N="305" REF="399"/>
and demanded of him the dissolution of the par∣liament.
Desborow, a man of a clownish and brutal
nature, threatened him if he should refuse. The Pro∣tector
wanted the resolution to deny, and possessed little
ability to resist.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of April. Richard de∣posed.</NOTE> The parliament was dissolved; and by
the same act the Protector was by every one considered
as effectually dethroned. Soon after, he signed his dis∣mission
in form.</P>
<P>HENRY, the deputy of Ireland, was endowed with
the same moderate disposition as Richard; but as he en∣joyed
more vigour and capacity, it was apprehended,
that he might make resistance. His popularity in Ire∣land
was great; and even his personal authority, not∣withstanding
his youth, was considerable. Had his am∣bition
been very eager, he had, no doubt, been able to
create disturbance: But being threatened by Sir Hardress
Waller, Colonel John Jones, and other officers, he very
quietly resigned his command, and retired to England.
He had once entertained thoughts, which he had not
resolution to execute, of proclaiming the King in Dub∣lin
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cate's Collections, vol. ii. p. 243.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS fell, suddenly and from an enormous height,
but, by a rare fortune, without any hurt or injury, the
family of the Cromwels. Richard continued to possess
an estate, which was very moderate, and burdened too
with a large debt, which he had contracted for the in∣terment
of his father. After the restoration, tho' he
remained unmolested, he thought proper to travel for
some years; and at Pezenas in Languedoc he was in∣troduced
under a borrowed name to the Prince of Conti.
That Prince, talking of English affairs, broke out into
admiration of Cromwel's courage and capacity. “But
as for that poor pitiful fellow, Richard,” said he,
“what has become of him? How could he be such a
<PB N="306" REF="400"/>
blockhead as to reap no greater benefit from all his
father's crimes and successes?” Richard extended his
peaceful and quiet life to an extreme old age, and died
not till the latter end of Queen Anne's reign. His so∣cial
virtues, more valuable than the greatest capacity,
met with a recompence, more precious than noisy same
and more suitable, contentment and tranquillity.</P>
<P>THE council of officers, now possessed of supreme
authority, deliberated what form of government they
should establish. Many of them feeured inclined to ex∣ercise
the power of the sword in the most open man∣ner:
but as it was apprehended, that the people would
with great difficulty be induced to pay taxes, levied by
arbitrary will and pleasure; it was agreed to preserve
the shadow of civil administration, and to revive the
long parliament, which had been expelled by Cromwel.
They could not be dissolved, it was asserted, but by
their own consent; and violence had interrupted, but
was not able to destroy, their right to government. The
officers also expected, that as these members had suffi∣ciently
felt their own weakness, they would be contented
to act in subordination to the military commanders, and
would thenceforth allow all the authority to remain where
the power was so visibly vested.</P>
<P>THE officers applied to Lenthal, the speaker, and
proposed to him, that the parliament should resume their
seats. Lenthal was a man of a low and timid spirit;
and being uncertain what issue might attend these coun∣cils,
was desirous of evading the proposal. He replied,
that he could by no means comply with the desire of the
officers; being engaged in a business of a far greater im∣portance
to himself, which he could not omit on any
account, because it concerned the salvation of his own
soul. The officers pressed him to know what it might
be. He was preparing, he said, to participate of the
<PB N="307" REF="401"/>
Lord's Supper; which he resolved to take the next sab∣bath
day. They insisted, that mercy was preferable to
sacrifice, and that he could not better prepare himself
for that great duty, than by contributing to the public
good. All their remonstrances had no effect. How∣ever,
on the appointed day, the speaker, being informed,
that a quorum of the house was likely to meet, thought
proper, notwithstanding the salvation of his soul, as
Ludlow observes, to join them; and the house imme∣diately
proceeded upon business. The secluded members
attempted, but in vain, to resume their seats among
them.</P>
<P>THE numbers of this parliament were very small,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Long parlia∣ment or Rump re∣stored.</NOTE> little
exceeding forty members: Their authority in the na∣tion,
ever since they had been purged by the army, was
extremely diminished; and after their expulsion, had
been totally annihilated: But being all of them men of
violent ambition; some of them men of experience and
capacity; they were resolved, since they enjoyed the
title of the supreme authority, and observed that some
appearance of a parliament was requisite for the purposes
of the army, not to act a subordinate part to those who
acknowleged themselves their servants. They chose a
council, in which they took care that the officers of
Wallingford-house should not be the majority: They
appointed Fleetwood to be lieutenant-general, but in∣serted
in his commission, that it should only continue
during the pleasure of the house: They chose seven per∣sons,
who should nominate to such commands as be∣came
vacant: And they voted, that all commissions
should be received from the speaker, and be signed by
him in the name of the parliament. These precautions,
the tendency of which was visible, gave great disgust to
the general officers; and their discontent would have
broke out into some resolution, fatal to the parliament,
<PB N="308" REF="402"/>
had it not been checked by the apprehensions of danger
from the common enemy.</P>
<P>THE bulk of the nation consisted of royalists and
presbyterians; and to both these parties the dominion of
the pretended parliament had ever been to the last de∣gree
odious. When this parliament was expelled by
Cromwel, contempt had succeeded to hatred; and no re∣serve
had been used in expressing the utmost derision
against the impotent ambition of these usurpers. See∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
them reinstated in authority, all orders of men felt
the highest indignation; together with apprehensions lest
such tyrannical rulers should exert their power in taking
vengeance upon their enemies, by whom they had been
so openly insulted. A secret reconcilement therefore,
was made between the rival parties; and it was agreed,
that, laying aside former enmities, all efforts should be
used for the overthrow of the Rump: For so they called
the parliament, in allusion to that part of the animal
body. The presbytcrians, sensible from experience, that
their passion for liberty, however laudable, had carried
them into unwarrantable extremes, were willing to lay
aside former jealousies, and, at all hazards, to restore
the royal family. The nobility, the gentry bent their
most passionate endeavours to the same enterprize, by
which alone they could be redeemed from slavery. And no
man was so remote from party, so indifferent to public
good, as not to feel the most ardent wishes, for the dis∣solution
of that tyranny, which, whether the civil or
the military part of it be considered, was equally oppres∣sive
and ruinous to the nation.</P>
<P>MORDAUNT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy of the royalists.</NOTE> who had so narrowly escaped on his
trial, before the high-court of justice, seemed rather ani∣mated
than daunted with past danger; and having, by
his resolute behaviour, obtained the highest confidence
of the royal party, he was now become the center of all
<PB N="309" REF="403"/>
their conspiracies. In many counties, a resolution was
taken to rise in arms. Lord Willoughby of Parham and
Sir Horatio Townshend undertook to secure Lynne:
General Massey engaged to seize Glocester: Lord New∣port,
Littleton, and other gentlemen conspired to take
possession of Shrewsbury; Sir George Booth of Chester;
Sir Thomas Middleton of North-Wales; Arundel, Pol∣lard,
Granville, Trelawney, of Plymouth and Exeter.
A day was appointed for the execution of all these en∣terprizes.
And the King attended by the Duke of
York, had arrived secretly at Calais, with a resolution
of putting himself at the head of his loyal subjects.
The French had promised to supply him with a small
body of forces, in order to countenance the insurrections
of the English.</P>
<P>THIS combination was disconcerted by the infidelity
of Sir Richard Willis. That traitor continued with the
parliament the same correspondence, which he had be∣gun
with Cromwel. He had engaged to reveal all con∣spiracies,
so far as to destroy their effect; but reserved
to himself, if he pleased, the power of concealing the
conspirators. He took care never to name any of the
old, genuine cavaliers, who had zealously adhered, and
were resolved still to adhere, to the royal cause in every
fortune. These men he esteemed; these he even loved.
He betrayed only the new converts among the presbyte∣rians,
or such lukewarm royalists, as, discouraged with
their disappointments, were resolved to expose them∣selves
to no more hazards. A lively proof, how impos∣sible
it is, even for the most corrupted minds, to divest
themselves of all regard to morality and social duty!</P>
<P>MANY of the conspirators in the different counties
were thrown into prison: Others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> astonished at such
symptoms of secret treachery, left their houses or re∣mained
quiet: The most tempestuous weather prevailed
during the whole time appointed for the rendevouzes;
<PB N="310" REF="404"/>
insomuch that some found it impossible to join their
friends, and others were dismayed with fear and supersti∣tion
at an incident so unusual during the summer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Of all the projects, the only one which took e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that of Sir George Booth for the seizing of Chester.
The Earl of Derby, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Mr.
Lee, Colonel Morgan took part in his enterprize. Sir
William Middleton joined him with some troops from
North Wales; and the insurgents were powerful enough
to subdue all in that neighbourhood, who ventured to
oppose them. In their declaration they made no men∣tion
of the King: They only demanded a free and full
parliament.</P>
<P>THE Rump were justly alarmed. How combustible
the materials were they well knew; and the fire was
now fallen among them. Booth was of a family emi∣nently
presbyterian; and his conjunction with the
royalists they regarded as a most dangerous symptom.
They had many officers, whose fidelity they could more
depend upon than that of Lambert: But there was no∣one
in whose vigilance and capacity they reposed such
confidence. They commissioned him to suppress the in∣surgents.
He made incredible haste. Booth impru∣dently
ventured himself out of the walls of Chester,
and exposed, in the open field, his raw troops against
these hardy veterans. He was soon routed and taken
prisoner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppressed.</NOTE> His whole party were dispersed. And the
parliament had no farther occupation than to fill all the
prisons with their open or secret enemies. Designs were
even entertained of transporting the loyal families to
Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the other colonies; lest they
should propagate in England children of the same ma∣lignant
affections with themselves.</P>
<P>THIS success hastened the ruin of the parliament.
Lambert, at the head of a body of troops, was no less
dangerous to them than Booth. A thousand pounds,
<PB N="311" REF="405"/>
which they sent him to buy a jewel, were employed by
him in liberalities to his officers. At his instigation they
drew up a petition, and transmitted it to Fleetwood, a
weak man, and an honest, if sincerity in folly deserves
that honourable name. The import of this petition
was, that Fleetwood should be made commander in
chief, Lambert major-general, Desborow lieutenant-ge∣neral
of the horse, Monk major-general of the foot.
To which, a demand was added, that no officer should
be dismissed from his command but by a court-martial.</P>
<P>THE parliament, alarmed at the danger, immediately
cashiered Lambert, Desborow, Berry, Clarke, Barrow,
Kelsey, Cobbet. Sir Arthur Hazelrig proposed the im∣peachment
of Lambert for high treason. Fleetwood's
commission was vacated, and the command of the army
was vested in seven persons, of whom that general was
one. The parliament voted, that they would have no
more general officers. And they declared it high treason
to levy any money without consent of parliament.</P>
<P>BUT these votes were feeble weapons in opposition to
the swords of the soldiery. Lambert drew some troops
together, in order to decide the controversy. Okey,
who was leading his regiment to the assistance of the
parliament, was deserted by them. Morley and Moss
brought their regiments into Palace-yard, resolute to
oppose the violence of Lambert.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Octo∣ber.</NOTE> But that artful general
knew an easy way of disappointing them. He placed
his soldiers in the streets which led to Westminster-hall.
When the speaker came in his coach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament expelled.</NOTE> he ordered the
horses to be turned, and very civilly conducted him home.
The other members were in like manner intercepted.
And the two regiments in Palace-yard, finding them∣selves
exposed to derision, peaceably retired to their quar∣ters.
A very little before this bold enterprize, a solemn
fast had been kept by the army; and it is remarked,
<PB N="312" REF="406"/>
that this ceremony was the usual prelude to every signal
violence which they committed.</P>
<P>THE officers found themselves again invested with su∣preme
authority, of which they intended for ever to re∣tain
the substance, however they might bestow on others
the empty shadow or appearance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th of Octo∣ber.</NOTE> They elected a com∣mittee
of twenty-three persons, of whom seven were
officers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Committee of Safety.</NOTE> These they pretended to invest with sovereign
authority; and called them a committee of safety. They
spoke every where of summoning a parliament, chosen
by the people; but they really took some steps towards
assembling a military parliament, composed of officers,
elected from every regiment in the service<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ludlow.</NOTE>. Through∣out
the three kingdoms there prevailed nothing but the
melancholy fears, to the nobility and gentry, of a bloody
massacre and extermination; to the rest of the people,
of perpetual servitude, beneath those sanctified robbers,
whose union and whose divisions would be equally de∣structive,
and who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under pretence of superior illumina∣tions,
would soon extirpate, if possible, all private mo∣rality,
as they had already all public law and justice,
from the British dominions.</P>
<P>DURING the time that England continued in this di∣stracted
condition, the other kingdoms of Europe were
hastening towards a composure of those differences, by
which they had so long been agitated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af∣fairs.</NOTE> The parliament,
while it preserved authority, instead of following the
destructive politics of Cromwel, and lending assistance to
the conquering Swede, embraced the prudent maxims of
the Dutch Commonwealth, and resolved, in conjunction
with that state, to mediate by force of arms an accom∣modation
between the northern crowns. Montague was
sent with a squadron to the Baltic, and carried with him
as ambassador Algernon Sidney, the famous republican.
<PB N="313" REF="407"/>
Sidney found the Swedish monarch employed in the siege
of Copenhagen, the capital of his enemy; and was
highly pleased, that, with a Roman arrogance, he could
check the progress of royal victories, and display in so
signal a manner the superiority of freedom above tyranny.
With the highest indignation, the ambitious Prince
was obliged to submit to the imperious mediation of the
two Commonwealths. “'Tis cruel,” said he, “that
laws should be prescribed me by parricides and ped∣lars.”
But his whole army was enclosed in an island,
and might be starved by the combined squadrons of
England and Holland. He was obliged therefore to
quit his prey, when he had so nearly got possession of
it; and having agreed to a pacification with Denmark,
retired into his own country, where he soon after
died.</P>
<P>THE wars between France and Spain were also con∣cluded
by the treaty of the Pyrenees. These bloody
animosities had long been carried on between the rival
states, even while governed by a sister and brother, who
cordially loved and esteemed each other. But politics,
which had so long prevailed over these friendly affections,
now at last yielded to their influence; and never was
the triumph more full and compleat. The Spanish Low
Countries, if not every part of that monarchy, lay al∣most
entirely at the mercy of its enemy. Broken ar∣mies,
disordered finances, slow and irresolute councils;
by these resources alone were the dispersed provinces of
Spain defended against the vigorous power of France.
But the Queen regent, anxious for the fate of her bro∣ther,
employed her authority with the cardinal to stop
the progress of the French conquests, and put an end to
a quarrel, which, being commenced by ambition, and
attended with victory, was at last concluded with mo∣deration.
The young monarch of France, tho' aspiring
<PB N="314" REF="408"/>
and warlike in his character, was at this time entirely
occupied in the pleasures of love and gallantry, and had
passively resigned the reins of the empire into the hands
of his politic minister. And he remained an uncon∣cerned
spectator; while an opportunity for conquest was
parted with, which he never was able, during the whole
course of his active reign, fully to retrieve.</P>
<P>THE ministers of the two crowns, Mazarine and Don
Louis de Haro, met at the foot of the Pyrenees, in the
Isle of Pheasants, a place which was supposed to belong
to neither kingdom. The negotiation being brought to
an issue by frequent conferences between the ministers,
the Monarchs themselves agreed to a congress; and these
two splendid courts appeared in their full lustre amidst
those savage mountains. Philip brought his daughter,
Mary Therese, along with him; and giving her in mar∣riage
to his nephew, Louis, endeavoured to cement by
this new tye the incompatible interests of the two mo∣narchies.
The French King made a solemn renuncia∣tion
of every succession, which might accrue to him in
right of his spouse; a vain formality, too weak to
restrain the ungoverned ambition of Princes.</P>
<P>THE affairs of England were in so great disorder,
that it was not possible to comprehend that kingdom in
the treaty, or adjust measures with a power, which was
in such incessant fluctuation. The King, reduced to
despair by the failure of all enterprizes for his restora∣tion,
was resolved to try the weak resource of foreign
succours; and he went to the Pyrenees at the time when
the two ministers were in the midst of their negotiations.
Don Louis received him with that generous civility,
peculiar to his nation; and expressed great inclination,
had the low condition of Spain allowed him, to give as∣sistance
to the distressed Monarch. The cautious Ma∣zarine,
pleading the alliance of France with the English
Commonwealth, refused even to see him; and though
<PB N="315" REF="409"/>
it is pretended, that the King offered to marry the Car∣dinal's
niece, he could, for the present, obtain nothing
but empty professions of respect and protestations of ser∣vice.
The condition of that Monarch, to all the
world, seemed totally desperate. His friends had been
baffled in every attempt for his service: The scaffold had
often streamed with the blood of the most active royalists:
The spirts of many were broke with tedious imprison∣ments:
The estates of all were burthened by the fines and
confiscations which had been levied from them: None durst
openly avow themselves of that party: And so small did
their number seem to a superficial view, that even should
the nation recover its liberty, which was esteemed no
wise probable, it was judged uncertain what form of
government it would embrace. But amidst all these
gloomy prospects, fortune, by a surprizing revolution,
was now paving the way for the King to mount in
peace and triumph the throne of his ancestors. It was
by the prudence and loyalty of General Monk, that this
happy change was at last accomplished.</P>
<P>GEORGE MONK, to whom the fate was reserved of
re-establishing monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Monk.</NOTE> and finishing the bloody dis∣sensions
of the three kingdoms, was the second son of a
family in Devonshire, antient and honourable, but
lately, from too great hospitality and expence, some∣what
fallen to decay. He betook himself, very early in
his youth, to the profession of arms; and was engaged
in the unfortunate expeditions to Cadiz and the isle of
Rhé. After England had concluded peace with all its
neighbours, he sought military experience in the Low
Countries, the great school of war to all the European
nations; and he rose to the command of a company
under Lord Goring. This company consisted of 200
men, of whom a hundred were volunteers, often gentle∣men
of family and estate, sometimes noblemen, who
lived upon their own fortunes in a splendid manner.
<PB N="316" REF="410"/>
Such a military turn at that time prevailed among the
English.</P>
<P>WHEN the sound of war was first heard in this island,
Monk returned to England, partly desirous of promo∣tion
in his native country, partly disgusted with some
ill usage from the States, of which he found reason to
complain. Upon the Scots pacification, he was em∣ployed
by the earl of Leicester against the Irish rebels;
and having obtained a regiment, was soon taken notice of,
for his military skill and for his calm and deliberate va∣lour.
Without ostentation, expence, or caresses, merely
by his humane and equal temper, he gained the good∣will
of all the soldiery; and with a mixture of familia∣rity
and affection, they usually called him <HI>honest George
Monk;</HI> an honourable appellation, which they still con∣tinued
to him, even during his greatest elevation. He
was remarkable for his moderation in party; and while
all around him were enflamed into rage against the op∣posite
faction, he fell under suspicion from the candour
and tranquillity of his behaviour. When the Irish army
was called over into England, surmises of this kind had
been so far credited, that he had even been suspended
from his command, and ordered to Oxford, that he
might answer the charge laid against him. His esta∣blished
character for truth and sincerity here stood him
in great stead; and upon his earnest protestations and
declarations, he was soon restored to his regiment,
which he joined at the siege of Nantwich. The very
next day after his arrival, Fairfax attacked and defeated
the royalists, commanded by Biron; and took Colonel
Monk prisoner. He was sent to the Tower, where he
endured, above two years, all the rigors of poverty and
confinement. The King, however, was so mindful as
to send him, notwithstanding his own difficulties, a pre∣sent
of a 100 guineas; but it was not till after the
royalists were totally subdued, that he recovered his li∣berty.
<PB N="317" REF="411"/>
Monk, however distressed, had always refused
the most inviting offers from the parliament: But
Cromwel, sensible of his merit, having sollicited him to
engage in the wars against the Irish, who were consider∣ed
as rebels both by King and parliament; he was not
unwilling to repair his broken fortunes by accepting a
command, which, he flattered himself, was reconcilable
to the strictest principles of honour. Having once en∣gaged
with the parliament, he was obliged to obey or∣ders;
and found himself necessitated to fight both against
the Marquess of Ormond in Ireland, and against the
King himself in Scotland. Upon the reduction of this
last kingdom, Monk was left with the supreme com∣mand;
and by the equality and justice of his admini∣stration
he was able to give contentment to that restless
people, now reduced to subjection by a nation whom
they hated. No less acceptable was his authority to the
officers and soldiers; and foreseeing, that the good will
of the army under his command might some time be of
great service to him, he had, with much care and suc∣cess,
cultivated their friendship.</P>
<P>THE connexions, which he had formed with Crom∣wel,
his benefactor, preserved him faithful to Richard,
who had been enjoined by his father to follow in every
thing the directions of General Monk. When the long
parliament was restored, Monk, who was not prepared
for opposition, acknowleged their authority, and was
continued in his command, from which it would not
have been safe to attempt the dislodging him. After the
army had expelled the parliament, he protested against
the violence, and resolved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk de∣clares for the parliament.</NOTE> as he pretended, to vindi∣cate
their invaded privileges. Deeper designs, either in
the King's favour or his own, were from the beginning
suspected to be the motive of his actions.</P>
<P>A RIVALSHIP had long subsisted between him and
Lambert: and every body saw the reason why he op∣posed
<PB N="318" REF="412"/>
himself to the advancement of that ambitious ge∣neral,
by whose success his own authority, he knew,
would soon be subverted. But little friendship had ever
been maintained between him and the parliamentary
leaders; and it seemed no wise probable, that he in∣tended
to employ his industry, and spend his blood for
the advancement of one enemy above another. How
early he entertained designs for the King's restoration,
we know not with certainty: It is likely, that, as soon
as Richard was deposed, he foresaw, that, without such
an expedient, it would be impossible ever to bring the
nation to a regular settlement. His elder and younger
brothers were entirely devoted to the royal cause: The
Granvilles, his near relations, and all the rest of his
kindred, were in the same interest: He himself was in∣toxicated
with no fumes of enthusiasm; and had main∣tained
no connexions with any of the fanatical tribe.
His early engagements had been with the King, and he
had left that service without receiving any disgust from
the royal family. Since he had inlisted himself with
the opposite party, he had been guilty of no violence or
rigor, which might render him obnoxious. His return,
therefore, to loyalty was easy and open; and nothing
could be supposed to counterballance his natural propen∣sity
to that measure, except the views of his own ele∣vation,
and the prospect of usurping the same grandeur
and authority, which had been assumed by Cromwel.
But from such exorbitant, if not impossible projects, the
natural tranquillity and moderation of his temper, the
calmness and solidity of his genius, and his limited ca∣pacity,
not to mention his age, now upon the decline,
seem to have set him at a distance. Cromwel himself,
he always asserted<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gumble's life of Monk, p. 93.</NOTE>, could not long have maintained
his usurpation; and any other person, even equal to
him in genius, it was obvious, would now find it more
<PB N="319" REF="413"/>
difficult to practise arts, of which every one, from expe∣rience,
was sufficiently aware. It is more agreeable,
therefore, to reason as well as candor to suppose, that
Monk, so soon as he put himself in movement, had en∣tertained
views of effectuating the King's restoration;
nor ought any objections, derived from his profound
silence even to Charles himself, be regarded as consider∣able.
His temper was naturally reserved, his circum∣stances
required dissimulation, the King he knew was
surrounded with spies and traitors; and upon the whole
it seems hard to interpret that conduct, which ought to
exalt our idea of his prudence, as a disparagement of his
probity.</P>
<P>SIR John Granville, hoping that the General would
engage in the King's service, sent into Scotland his
younger brother, a clergyman, Dr. Monk, who car∣ried
him a letter and invitation from the King. When
the Doctor arrived, he found, that his brother was then
holding a council of officers, and was not to be seen for
some hours. In the mean time, he was received and
entertained by Price, the General's chaplain, a man of
probity, as well as a partizan of the King's. The Doc∣tor
having an entire confidence in the chaplain, talked
very freely with him about the object of his journey,
and engaged him, if there should be occasion, to second
his applications. At last, the General arrives; the bro∣thers
embrace; and after some preliminary conversa∣tion,
the Doctor opens his business. Monk interrupts
him to know, whether he had ever before to any body
mentioned the subject of his journey. “To no body,”
replied his brother, “but to Price, whom I know to
be entirely in your confidence.” The General, al∣tering
his countenance, changed the discourse; and
would enter into no farther confidence with him, but
sent him away with the first opportunity. He would
not trust his own brother the moment he knew that he
<PB N="320" REF="414"/>
had disclosed the secret; though to a man whom he
himself could have trusted<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Lansdown's defence of General Monk.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His conduct in all other particulars was full of the
same reserve and prudence; and no less was requisite
for effecting the difficult work which he had undertaken.
All the officers in his army, of whom he entertained any
suspicion, he immediately cashiered: Cobbet, who had
been sent by the Committee of Safety, under pretence
of communicating their resolutions to Monk, but really
with a view of debauching his army, he committed to
custody: He drew together the several scattered regi∣ments:
He summoned an assembly, somewhat resem∣bling
a convention of estates in Scotland; and having
communicated his resolution of marching into England,
he received from them a seasonable, though no great
supply of money.</P>
<P>HRARING that Lambert was advanced northward
with his army, Monk sent Cloberry and two other com∣missioners
to London with large professions of his incli∣nation
to peace, and with offers of terms for an accom∣modation.
His chief aim was to obtain delay, and re∣lax
the preparations of his enemies. The Committee
of Safety fell into the snare. A treaty was signed by
the commissioners; but Monk refused to ratify it, and
complained that his commissioners had exceeded their
powers. He desired however to enter into a new nego∣tiation
at Newcastle. The Committee willingly ac∣cepted
this fallacious offer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> MEANWHILE these military sovereigns found them∣selves
surrounded on all hands with inextricable difficul∣ties.
The nation had fallen into a total anarchy; and by
refusing the payment of all taxes, reduced the army to the
greatest necessities. While Lambert's forces were as∣sembling
at Newcastle, Hazelrig and Morley took pos∣session
<PB N="321" REF="415"/>
of Portsmouth, and declared for the parliament.
A party sent to suppress them, were persuaded by their
commander to join in the same declaration. The city
apprentices rose in a tumult, and demanded a free
parliament. Though they were suppressed by Colonel
Hewson, a man who from the profession of a cobler had
risen to a high rank in the army, the city still discovered
symptoms of the most dangerous discontent. It even
established a kind of separate government, and assumed
the supreme authority within itself. Admiral Lauson
with his squadron came into the river, and declared for
the parliament. Hazelrig and Morley, hearing of this
important event, left Portsmouth, and advanced to∣wards
London. The regiments near that city, being
sollicited by their old officers, who had been cashiered
by the Committee of Safety, revolted again to the par∣liament.
Desborow's regiment, being sent by Lambert
to support his friends, no sooner arrived at St. Alba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,
than it declared for the same assembly.</P>
<P>FLEETWOOD'S hand was found too weak and unstable
to support this ill-founded fabric, which, every where
around him, was falling into ruins. When he received
intelligence of any murmurs among the soldiers, he
would fall upon his knees in prayer, and could hardly
be prevailed with to join the troops. Even when among
them, in the midst of any discourse, he would invite
them all to prayers, and put himself on his knees be∣fore
them. If any of his friends exhorted him to more
vigor, they could get no other answer, than that God
had spit in his face, and would not hear him. Men
now ceased to wonder, why Lambert had promoted him
to the office of General, and had been contented him∣self
with the second command in the army.</P>
<P>LENTHAL, the speaker, being invited by the officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th of De∣cember.</NOTE>
again assumed authority, and summoned together the
parliament, which twice before had been expelled with
<PB N="322" REF="416"/>
so much reproach and ignominy. As soon as assembled,
they repealed their act against the payment of excise
and customs; they appointed commissioners for assign∣ing
quarters to the army;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament restored.</NOTE> and without taking any no∣tice
of Lambert, they sent orders to the forces under his
command immediately to repair to those garrisons, which
were appointed them.</P>
<P>LAMBERT was now in a very disconsolate condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1660.</NOTE>
Monk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> he saw, had passed the Tweed at Coldstream,
and was advancing upon him. His own soldiers de∣serted
him in great multitudes, and joined the enemy.
Lord Fairfax too, he heard, had raised forces behind
him, and possessed himself of York, without declaring
his purpose. The last orders of the parliament so en∣tirely
stripped him of his army, that there remained not
with him above 100 horse: All the rest went to their
quarters with quietness and resignation; and himself
was, some time after, committed to the Tower. The
other officers of the army, who had formerly been
cashiered by the parliament, and had resumed their
commands that they might subdue that assembly, were
again cashiered and confined to their own houses. Sir
Harry Vane and other members, who had concurred
with the Committee of Safety, were ordered into a like
confinement. And the parliament now seemed to be
again possessed of a more absolute authority than ever,
and to be without any danger of opposition or contra∣diction.</P>
<P>THE republican party was at this time headed by two
men, Hazelrig and Vane, who were of very opposite
characters, and mortally hated each other. Hazelrig,
who possessed greater authority in the parliament, was
haughty, imperious, precipitate, vain-glorious; with∣out
civility, without prudence; qualified only by his
noisy, pertinacious obstinacy to acquire an ascendant in
<PB N="323" REF="417"/>
public councils. Vane was noted, in all civil transac∣tions,
for temper, insinuation, address, and a profound
judgment; in all religious speculations, for folly and
extravagance. He was a perfect enthusiast; and fancy∣ing
that he was certainly favoured with inspiration, he
deemed himself, to speak in the language of the times,
to be a <HI>man above ordinances,</HI> and by reason of his per∣fection,
to be unlimited and unrestrained by any rules,
which govern inferior mortals. These whimsies, ming∣ling
with pride, had so corrupted his excellent under∣standing,
that sometimes he thought himself the person
deputed to reign on earth for a thousand years over the
whole congregation of the faithful<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MONK, though informed of the restoration of the
parliament, from whom he received no orders, still ad∣vanced
with his army, which was near 6000 men: The
scattered forces in England were above four times more
numerous. Fairfax, who had resolved to declare for the
King, not being able to make the General open his in∣tentions,
retired to his own house in Yorkshire. In all
countries through which Monk passed, the prime gen∣try
flocked to him with addresses, expressing their ear∣nest
desire, that he would be instrumental in restoring
the nation to peace and tranquillity, and to the enjoy∣ment
of those liberties, which by law were their birth∣right,
but of which, during so many years, they had
been fatally bereaved: And that, in order to this salu∣tary
purpose, he would prevail, either for the restoring
those members, who had been secluded before the
King's death, or for the election of a new parliament,
who might, legally and by general consent, again go∣vern
the nation. Though Monk pretended not to fa∣vour
these addresses, that ray of hope, which the know∣ledge
of his character and situation afforded, mightily
animated all men. The tyranny and the anarchy,
<PB N="324" REF="418"/>
which now equally oppressed the kingdom; the expe∣rience
of past distractions, the fear of future convul∣sions,
the indignation against military usurpation,
against sanctified hypocrisy: All these motives had unit∣ed
every party, except the most desperate, into ardent
wishes for the King's restoration, the only remedy for
all these fatal evils.</P>
<P>SCOT and Robinson were sent as deputies by the par∣liament,
under pretence of congratulating the General,
but in reality to serve as spies upon him. The city dis∣patched
four of their principal citizens to perform like
compliments; and at the same time to confirm the Ge∣neral
in his inclination to a free parliament, the object
of all men's prayers and endeavours. The authority of
Monk could scarce secure the parliamentary deputies
from those insults, which the general hatred and con∣tempt
towards their masters drew from men of every
rank and denomination.</P>
<P>MONK continued his march with few intervals till he
came to St. Albans. He there sent a message to the
parliament, desiring them to remove from London those
regiments, who, though they now professed to return
to their duty, had so lately offered violence to that as∣sembly.
This message was unexpected, and exceed∣ingly
perplexed the house. Their fate, they found,
must still depend on a mercenary army; and they were
as distant as ever from their imaginary sovereignty.
However, they found it necessary to comply. The sol∣diers
made more difficulty. A mutiny arose among
them. One regiment in particular, which was quartered
in Somerset-house, expressly refused to yield their place
to the northern army. But those officers, who would
gladly, on such an occasion, have inflamed the quarrel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Febru∣ary.</NOTE>
were absent or in confinement; and for want of leaders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk enters London.</NOTE>
the soldiers were at last, with great reluctance, obliged
<PB N="325" REF="419"/>
to comply. Monk with his army took quarters at
Westminster.</P>
<P>THE General was introduced to the house; and
thanks were given him by Lenthal for the eminent ser∣vices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE>
which he had done his country. Monk was a
prudent, but not an eloquent speaker. He told the
house, that the services, which he had been enabled to
perform, were no more than his duty, and merited not
such praises as those with which they were pleased to
honour him: That among many persons of greater
worth, who bore their commission, he had been em∣ployed
as the instrument of providence for effecting their
restoration; but he considered this service only as a step
to more important services, which it was their part to
render to the nation: That as he marched along, he
observed all ranks of men, in all places, to be in earnest
expectation of a settlement, after the violent convulsions,
to which they had been exposed; and to have no pro∣spect
of such a blessing but from the dissolution of the
present parliament, and from the summoning of a new
one, free and full, who, meeting without oaths or en∣gagements,
might finally give contentment to the na∣tion:
That applications had been made to him for that
purpose; but that he, sensible of his duty, had still told
the petitioners, that the parliament itself, which was
now free and would soon be full, was the best judge of
all these measures, and that the whole community ought
to acquiesce in their determination: That though he
expressed himself in this manner to the people, he must
now freely inform the house, that the fewer engage∣ments
were exacted, the more comprehensive would
their plan prove, and the more satisfaction would it
give to the nation: And that it was sufficient for pub∣lic
security, if the fanatic party and the royalists were
excluded; since the principles of these factions were
destructive either of government or of liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="420"/>
THIS speech, containing matter, which was both
agreeable and disagreeable to the house as well as to the
nation, still kept every one insuspence, and upheld that
uncertainty, in which it seemed the General's interest
to retain the public. But it was impossible for the
kingdom to remain long in this doubtful situation: The
people, as well as the parliament, pushed matters to a
decision. During the late convulsions, the payment of
taxes had been interrupted; and though the parliament,
upon their assembling, renewed the ordinances for all
collections and impositions, yet so little reverence did
the people pay those legislators, that they gave very
slow and unwilling obedience to their commands. The
common council of London flatly refused to submit to
an assessment, required of them; and declared, that, till
a free and lawful parliament imposed taxes, they never
would deem it their duty to make any payment. This
resolution would immediately have put an end to the
dominion of the parliament: They were determined,
therefore, upon this occasion to make at once a full ex∣periment
of their own power and of their General's obe∣dience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> MONK received orders to march into the city, to
seize twelve persons the most obnoxious to the parlia∣ment,
to remove the posts and chains from all the
streets, and to take down and break the portcullises and
gates of the city: And very few hours were allowed
him to deliberate upon the execution of these violent
orders. To the great surprize and constermation of all
men, Monk prepared himself for obedience. Neglect∣ing
the entreaties of his friends, the remonstrances of
his officers, the cries of the people, he entered the city
in a military manner; he apprehended as many as he
could of the proscribed persons, whom he sent to the
Tower; with all the circumstances of contempt he
broke the gates and portcullises; and having exposed
<PB N="327" REF="421"/>
the city to the scorn and derision of all who hated it, he
returned in triumph to his quarters in Westminster.</P>
<P>NO sooner had the General leisure to reflect, than he
found, that this last measure, instead of being a conti∣nuation
of that cautious ambiguity, which he had hi∣therto
maintained, was taking party without reserve,
and laying himself, as well as the nation, at the mercy
of that tyrannical parliament, whose power had long
been odious, as well as their persons contemptible, to
all men. He resolved therefore, before it was too late,
to repair the dangerous mistake, into which he had
been betrayed, and to show the whole world, still more
without reserve, that he meant no longer to be the mi∣nister
of violence and usurpation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> After complaining of
the odious service, in which he had been employed; he
wrote a letter to the house, reproaching them, as well
with the new cabals which they had formed with Vane
and Lambert, as with the encouragement given to a fa∣natical
petition presented by Barebone; and he required
them, in the name of the citizens, soldiers, and whole
Commonwealth, to issue writs within a week for the
filling their house, and to fix the time for their own
dissolution and the assembling of a new parliament.
Having dispatched this letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declares for a free parlia∣ment.</NOTE> which might be regard∣ed,
he thought, as an undoubted pledge of his sincerity,
he marched with his army into the city, and desired
Allen, the mayor, to summon a common-council at
Guildhall. He there made many apologies for the in∣dignity,
which, two days before, he had been obliged
to put upon them; assured them of his perseverance in
the measures which he had adopted; and desired that
they might mutually plight their faith for a strict union
between city and army, in every enterprize for the hap∣piness
and settlement of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>IT is impossible to describe the joy and exultation,
which displayed itself throughout the city, as soon as
<PB N="328" REF="422"/>
intelligence was conveyed of this happy measure, em∣braced
by the General. The prospect of peace, con∣cord,
liberty, justice, broke forth at once, from amidst
the deepest darkness, in which the nation had ever
been involved. The view of past calamities no longer
presented dismal prognostics of the future: It tended
only to inhance the general exultation for those scenes
of happiness and tranquillity, which all men now con∣fidently
promised themselves. The royalists, the pres∣byterians,
forgetting all animosities, mingled in com∣mon
joy and transport, and vowed never more to gratify
the ambition of false and factious tyrants, by their cala∣mitous
divisions. The populace, more outrageous in
their festivity, made the whole air resound with accla∣mations,
and illuminated every street with signals of
jollity and triumph. Applauses of the General were
every where intermingled with detestation against the
parliament. The most ridiculous inventions were
adopted, in order to express this latter passion. At
every bonfire rumps were roasted; and where these
could no longer be found, pieces of flesh were cut into
that shape: And the funeral of the parliament (the po∣pulace
exclaimed) was celebrated by these symbols of
hatred and derision.</P>
<P>THE parliament, though in the agonies of despair,
made still one effort for the recovery of their dominion.
They sent a committee with offers to gain the Gene∣ral.
He refused to hear them except in the presence of
some of the secluded members. Though several per∣sons,
desperate from guilt and fanaticism, promised to
invest him with the dignity of supreme magistrate and to
support his government, he would not hearken to such
wild proposals. Having fixed a close correspondence
with the city, and established its militia in hands,
whose fidelity could be relied on, he marched again
with his army to Westminster, and pursued every pro∣per
<PB N="329" REF="423"/>
measure for the settlement of the nation. While
he still pretended to maintain republican principles, he
was taking large steps towards the re-establishment of
the antient monarchy.</P>
<P>THE secluded members, upon the General's invita∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21st of Fe∣bruary. Secluded members re∣stored.</NOTE>
went to the House, and finding no longer any
obstruction, they entered, and immediately appeared to
be the majority: Most of the independants left the
place. The restored members first repealed all the or∣ders,
by which they had been excluded: They gave
Sir George Boothe and all his party their liberty and
estates: They renewed and enlarged the General's com∣mission:
They fixed an assessment for the support of the
fleet and army: And having passed these votes for the
present composure of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of March. Long parlia∣ment dis∣solved.</NOTE> they dissolved them∣selves,
and gave orders for the immediate assembling of
a new parliament. This last measure had been previ∣ously
concerted with the General, who knew, that all
men, however different in affections, expectations, and
designs, united in their detestation of the long parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>A COUNCIL OF STATE was established, consisting of
men of dignity and moderation; most of whom, during
the civil wars, had made a great figure among the pres∣byterians.
The militia of the kingdom was put into
such hands as would promote order and settlement.
These, conjoined with Monk's army, which lay united
at London, were esteemed a sufficient check on the more
numerous, though dispersed army, of whose inclinations
there was still much reason to be diffident. Monk,
however, was every day removing the more obnoxious
officers, and bringing the troops to a state of discipline
and obedience.</P>
<P>OVERTON, governor of Hull, had declared his reso∣lution
to keep possession of that fortress till the coming
<PB N="330" REF="424"/>
of King Jesus: But when Alured produced the autho∣rity
of the parliament for his delivering the place to Co∣lonel
Fairfax, he thought proper to comply.</P>
<P>MONTAGUE, who commanded the fleet in the Bal∣tic,
had entered into the same conspiracy with Sir
George Boothe; and pretending want of provisions, had
sailed from the Sound towards the coast of England,
with an intention of seconding that enterprize of the
royalists. On his arrival he received the news of
Boothe's defeat, and the total failure of the insurrection.
The great difficulties to which the parliament was re∣duced,
allowed them no leisure to examine strictly the
reasons, which he gave for quitting his station; and they
allowed him to retire peaceably to his country house.
The Council of State now conferred on him, in con∣junction
with Monk, the command of the fleet; and
secured the naval, as well as military force in hands fa∣vourable
to the public settlement.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all these steps, which were
taking towards the re-establishment of monarchy, Monk
still maintained the appearance of zeal for a Common∣wealth,
and hitherto allowed no canal of correspon∣dence
between himself and the King to be opened. To
call a free parliament, and to restore the royal family,
were visibly, in the present disposition of the kingdom,
one and the same measure: Yet would not the General
declare, otherways than by his actions, that he had
adopted the King's interest; and nothing but neces∣sity,
at last extorted the confession from him. His
silence, in the commencement of his enterprize, ought
to be no objection to his sincerity; since he maintained
the same reserve, at a time, when, consistent with com∣mon
sense, he could have entertained no other purpose<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">After Monk's declaration for a free parliament on the 11th of February, he could mean nothing but the King's restoration: Yet it was long before he would open himself even to the King. This declaration was within eight days after his arrival in London. Had he ever intended to have set up him∣self, he would not surely have so soon abandoned a project so inviting: He would have taken some steps, which would have betrayed it. It could only have been some disappointment, some frustrated attempt, which could have made him renounce the road of private ambition. But there is not the least symptom of such intentions. The story told of Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, by Mr. Locke, has not any appearance of truth. See Lord Lansdown's Vin∣dication, and Philips's Continuation of Baker. I shall add to what those au∣thors have advanced, that Cardinal Mazarine wished for the King's restora∣tion; though he would not have ventured much to have procured it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="425"/>
THERE was one Morrice, a gentleman of Devon∣shire,
of a sedentary, studious disposition, nearly re∣lated
to Monk, and one who had always maintained the
strictest intimacy with him. With this friend alone did
Monk deliberate concerning that great enterprize,
which he had formed. Sir John Granville, who had a
commission from the King, applied to Morrice for ac∣cess
to the General; but received for answer, that the
General desired him to communicate his business to
Morrice. Granville, though importunately urged,
twice refused to deliver his message to any but Monk
himself; and that cautious politician, finding him now
a person, whose secresy could be safely trusted, admit∣ted
him to his presence, and opened to him his whole
intentions. Still he scrupled to commit any thing to
paper<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lansdowne, Clarendon.</NOTE>: He delivered only a verbal message by Gran∣ville,
assuring the King of his services, giving advice
for his conduct, and exhorting him instantly to leave
the Spanish territories, and retire into Holland. He
was justly apprehensive lest Spain might retain him as
a pledge for the recovery of Dunkirk and Jamaica.
Charles followed these directions, and very narrowly
escaped to Breda. Had he protracted his journey a few
hours, he had certainly, under pretence of honour and
respect, been arrested by the Spaniards.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="426"/>
LOCKHART, who was governor of Dunkirk, and no
wise averse to the King's service, was applied to on
this occasion. The state of England was set before him,
the certainty of the restoration represented, and the
prospect of great favour displayed, if he would antici∣pate
the vows of the kingdom, and receive the King
into his garrison. Lockhart still replied that his com∣mission
was derived from an English parliament, and be
would not open his gates but in obedience to the same
authority<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>. The scruple, though in the present emer∣gence
it approaches towards superstition, it is difficult
for us entirely to condemn.</P>
<P>THE elections for the new parliament went every
where in favour of the King's party. This was one of
those popular torrents, where the most indifferent, or
even the most averse, are transported with the general
passion, and zealously adopt the sentiments of the so∣ciety,
to which they belong. The enthusiasts them∣selves
seemed to be disarmed of their fury; and between
despair and astonishment gave way to those measures,
which, they found, it would be impossible for them, by
their utmost efforts, to withstand. The presbyterians,
the royalists, being united, formed the voice of the na∣tion,
which, without noise, but with infinite ardour,
called for the King's restoration. The kingdom was
almost entirely in the hands of the former party; and
some zealous leaders among them began to renew the
demand of those conditions, which had been required of
the late King in the treaty of Newport: But the gene∣ral
opinion seemed to condemn all those rigorous and
jealous capitulations with their sovereign. Harrassed
with convulsions and disorders, men ardently longed for
repose, and were terrified with the mention of negotia∣tions
or delay, which might afford opportunity to the
seditious army still to breed new confusion. The pas∣sion
<PB N="333" REF="427"/>
too for liberty, having been carried to such violent
extremes, and having produced such bloody commo∣tions,
began, by a natural movement, to give place to
a spirit of loyalty and obedience; and the public were
less zealous in a cause, which was become odious, on
account of the calamities which had so long attended it.
After the concessions made by the late King, the con∣stitution
seemed to be sufficiently secured; and the ad∣ditional
conditions insisted on, as they had been framed
during the greatest ardour of the contest, amounted ra∣ther
to an annihilation than a limitation of monarchy.
Above all, the General was averse to the mention of
conditions; and resolved, that the crown, which he in∣tended
to restore, should be conferred on the King en∣tirely
free and unincumbered. Without farther scruple,
therefore, or jealousy, the people gave their voice in
elections for such as they knew to entertain sentiments
favourable to monarchy; and all payed court to a party,
which, they foresaw, was soon to govern the nation.
Though the parliament had voted, that no one should
be elected, who had himself, or whose father had borne
arms for the late King; very little regard was any
where payed to this ordinance. The leaders of the
presbyterians, the Earl of Manchester, Lord Fairfax,
Lord Roberts, Hollis, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper,
Annesley, Lewis, were determined to atone for past
transgressions by their present zeal for the royal inte∣rests;
and from former merits, successes, and suffer∣ings,
they had acquired with their party the highest cre∣dit
and authority.</P>
<P>THE affairs of Ireland were in a condition no less
favourable to the King. As soon as Monk declared
against the English army, he dispatched emissaries into
Ireland, and engaged the officers in that kingdom to
concur with him in the same measures. Lord Broghill,
<PB N="334" REF="428"/>
President of Munster, and Sir Charles Coote, President
of Connaught, went so far as to enter into a correspon∣dence
with the King, and to promise their assistance for
his restoration. In conjunction with Sir Theophilus
Jones, and other officers, they took possession of the
government, and excluded Ludlow, who was zealous
for the parliament, but whom they pretended to be in a
confederacy with the Committee of Safety. They kept
themselves in readiness to serve the King; but made no
declarations, till they should see the turn, which affairs
took in England.</P>
<P>BUT all these promising views had almost been blasted
by an untoward accident. Upon the admission of the
secluded members, the republican party, particularly
the late King's judges, were seized with the justest de∣spair,
and endeavoured to infuse the same sentiments into
the whole army. By themselves or their emissaries,
they represented to the soldiers, that all those brave ac∣tions,
which had been performed during the war, and
which were so meritorious in the eyes of the parlia∣ment,
would no doubt be regarded as the deepest crimes
by the royalists, and would expose the army to the se∣verest
vengeance. That in vain did that party make
professions of moderation and lenity: The King's
death, the execution of so many of the nobility and
gentry, the sequestrations and imprisonment of the rest,
were in their eyes crimes so deep, and offences so per∣sonal,
as must be prosecuted with the most implacable
resentment. That the loss of all arrears, the casheering
every officer and soldier, were the lightest punishment,
which must be expected: After the dispersion of the
army, no farther protection remained to them, either
for life or property, but the clemency of enraged ene∣mies.
And that, even, if the most perfect security
could be obtained, it was inglorious to be reduced, by
<PB N="335" REF="429"/>
treachery and deceit, to subjection under a foe, who,
in the open field, had so often yielded to their superior
valour.</P>
<P>AFTER these suggestions had been infused into the
army, Lambert suddenly made his escape from the
Tower, and threw Monk and the Council of State into
the greatest consternation. They knew Lambert's
vigour and activity; they were acquainted with his
great popularity in the army; they were sensible, that,
though the soldiers had lately deserted him, they suffi∣ciently
expressed their remorse and their detestation of
those, who, by false professions, they found, had so
egregiously deceived them. It seemed necessary, there∣fore,
to employ the greatest celerity in suppressing so
dangerous an enemy: Colonel Ingoldsby, who had
been named one of the late King's judges, but who was
now entirely engaged in the royal cause, was dispatch∣ed
after him. He overtook him at Daventry, while he
had yet assembled but four troops of horse. One of
them deserted him. Another quickly followed the ex∣ample.
He himself, endeavouring to make his escape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of April.</NOTE>
was seized by Ingoldsby, to whom he made submissions
not suitable to his former character of spirit and valour.
Okey, Axtel, Cobbet, Crede, and other officers of that
party were taken prisoners with him. All the roads
were full of soldiers hastening to join them. In a few
days they would have been very formidable. And it
was thought, that it might prove dangerous for Monk
himself to have assembled any considerable body of his
republican army for their suppression: So that nothing
could be more happy than the sudden extinction of this
rising flame.</P>
<P>WHEN the parliament met, they chose Sir Harbottle
Grimstone speaker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of April.</NOTE> a man, who, though he had for
some time concurred with the late parliament, had long
<PB N="336" REF="430"/>
been esteemed affectionate to the King's service. The
great dangers, incurred during the former usur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ns,
joined to the extreme caution of the Gene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, kept
every one in awe; and no one dared, for some days, to
make any mention of the King. The members chiefly
exerted their spirit in bitter invectives against the me∣mory
of Cromwel, and in execrations upon the inhu∣man
murther of their late Sovereign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of May.</NOTE> At last, the Ge∣neral,
having sufficiently sounded their inclinations,
gave directions to Annesley, president of the council, to
inform them, that one Sir John Granville, a servant of
the King's, had been sent over by his Majesty, and was
now at the door with a letter to the Commons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The restora∣tion.</NOTE> The
loudest acclamations were excited by this intelligence.
Granville was called in: The letters, accompanied with
a declaration, greedily read: Without one moment's
delay, and without a contradictory vote, a committee
was appointed to prepare an answer: And in order to
spread the same satisfaction throughout the kingdom, it
was voted that the letter and declaration should imme∣diately
be published.</P>
<P>THE people, freed from that state of suspence in
which they had so long been held, now changed their
anxious hope for the unmixt effusions of joy; and dis∣played
a social triumph, and exultation, which no pri∣vate
prosperity, even the greatest, is ever able fully to
inspire. Traditions remain of men who died for plea∣sure,
when informed of this happy and surprising event.
The King's declaration was well calculated to uphold
the satisfaction, inspired by the prospect of public settle∣ment.
It offered a general amnesty to all persons what∣soever;
and that without any exceptions but such as
should afterwards be made by parliament: It promised a
liberty of conscience; and a concurrence in any act of
parliament, which, upon mature deliberation, should
be offered, for the insuring that indulgence: The en∣quiry
<PB N="337" REF="431"/>
into all grants, purchases, and alienations, it sub∣mitted
to the arbitration of the same assembly: And it
assured the soldiers of all their arrears, and promised
them, for the future, the same pay which they then en∣joyed.</P>
<P>THE Lords, perceiving the spirit, by which the
kingdom as well as the Commons were animated, hast∣ened
to re-instate themselves in their antient authority,
and to take their share in the settlement of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion.
They found the doors of their house open; and all
were admitted, even such as had formerly been excluded
on account of their pretended delinquency.</P>
<P>THE two houses attended; while the King was pro∣claimed
with great solemnity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of May.</NOTE> in Palace-Yard, at
Whitehall, and at Temple-Bar. The Commons voted
500 pounds to buy a jewel for Granville, who had
brought them the King's gracious messages: A present
of 50,000 pounds was conferred on the King, 10,000
pounds on the Duke of York, 5000 pounds on the
Duke of Glocester. A committee of Lords and Com∣mons
was dispatched to invite his Majesty to return and
take possession of his dominions. The rapidity, with
which all these events were conducted, was marvellous,
and discovered the passionate zeal and entire unanimity
of the nation. Such an impatience appeared, and such
an emulation, in Lords, and Commons, and City, who
should make the most lively expressions of their joy
and duty; that, as the noble historian expresses it, a
man could not but wonder where those people dwelt,
who had done all the mischief, and kept the King so
many years from enjoying the comfort and support of
such excellent subjects. The King himself said, that it
must surely have been his own fault, that he had not
sooner taken possession of the throne; since he found
every body so zealous for promoting his happy restora∣tion.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="432"/>
THE respect of foreign powers soon followed the sub∣mission
of the King's subjects. Spain invited him to
return to the Low Countries, and embark in some of
their maritime towns. France made protestations of af∣fection
and regard, and offered Calais for the same pur∣pose.
The States-General sent deputies with a like
friendly invitation. The King resolved to accept of
this last offer. The people of the republic bore him a
very cordial affection; and politics no longer restrained
their magistrates from promoting and expressing that
sentiment. As he passed from Breda to the Hague, he
was attended with numerous crowds, and was received
with the loudest acclamations; as if themselves, not their
rivals in power and commerce, were now restored to
peace and security. The States-General in a body,
and afterwards the States of Holland apart, performed
their compliments with the greatest solemnity: Every
person of distinction was ambitious of being introduced
to his Majesty; all ambassadors and public ministers of
kings, princes, or states, repaired to him, and professed
the joy of their masters on his behalf: So that one
would have thought, that, from the united efforts of
Christendom, had been derived this revolution, which
diffused every where such universal satisfaction.</P>
<P>THE English fleet came in sight of Scheveling. Mon∣tague
had not waited for orders from the parliament;
but had persuaded the officers, of themselves, to tender
their duty to his Majesty. The Duke of York imme∣diately
went on board, and took the command of the
fleet as Lord High Admiral.</P>
<P>WHEN the King disembarked at Dover, he was met
by the General, whom he cordially embraced. Never
subject in fact, probably in his intentions, had deserved
better of his King and country. In the space of a few
months, without effusion of blood, by his cautious and
<PB N="339" REF="433"/>
disinterested conduct alone, he had bestowed settlement
on three kingdoms, which had long been torne with
the most violent convulsions: And having obstinately
refused the most inviting conditions, offered him by the
King as well as by every party in the kingdom, he
freely restored his injured master to the vacant throne.
The King entered London on the 29th of May, which
was also his birth-day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of May</NOTE> The fond imaginations of
men interpreted as a happy omen the concurrence of
two such joyful periods.</P>
<P>AT this aera, it may be proper to stop for a moment,
and take a general survey of the age, so far as re∣gards
manners, finances, arms, commerce, arts and
sciences. The chief use of history is, that it affords
materials for disquisitions of this nature; and it seems
the duty of an historian to point out the proper infe∣rences
and conclusions.</P>
<P>NO people could undergo a change more sudden and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners and arts.</NOTE>
entire in their manners than did the English nation dur∣ing
this period. From tranquillity, concord, submis∣sion,
sobriety, they passed in an instant to a state of
faction, fanaticism, rebellion, and almost frenzy. The
violence of the English parties exceeded any thing,
which we can now imagine: Had they continued but a
little longer, there was just reason to dread all the hor∣rors
of the antient massacres and proscriptions. The
military usurpers, whose authority was founded on
<PB N="340" REF="434"/>
palpable injustice, and was supported by no national
party, would have been impelled by rage and despair
into such sanguinary measures; and if these furious
expedients had been embraced on one side, revenge would
naturally have pushed the other party, after a return
of power, to retaliate upon their enemies. No social
intercourse was maintained between the parties; no
marriages or alliances contracted. The royalists,
though oppressed, harrassed, persecuted, disdained all
affinity with their masters. The more they were re∣duced
to subjection, the greater superiority did they
affect above those usurpers, who by violence and in∣justice
had acquired an ascendant over them.</P>
<P>THE manners of the two factions were as opposite as
those of the most distant nations. “Your friends, the
Cavaliers,” said a parliamentarian to a royalist, “are
very dissolute and debauched.” “Yes” replied the
royalists, “they have the infirmities of men: But your
friends, the roundheads, have the vices of devils,
tyranny, rebellion, and spiritual pride<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sir Philip Warwic.</NOTE>.” Riot and
disorder, it is certain, notwithstanding the good ex∣ample
set them by Charles the first, prevailed very
much among his partizans. Being commonly men of
birth and fortune, to whom excesses are less pernicious
than to the vulgar, they were too apt to indulge them∣selves
in all pleasures, particularly those of the table.
Opposition to the rigid preciseness of their antagonists
increased their inclination to good-fellowship; and the
character of a man of pleasure was affected among
them, as a sure pledge of attachment to the church and
monarchy. Even when ruined by confiscations and se∣questrations,
they endeavoured to maintain the appear∣ance
of a careless and social jollity. “As much as
hope is superior to fear,” said a poor and merry ca∣valier,
<PB N="341" REF="435"/>
“so much is our situation preferable to that of
our enemies. We laugh while they tremble.”</P>
<P>THE gloomy enthusiasm, which prevailed among
great numbers of the parliamentary party, is surely the
most curious spectacle presented by any history; and
the most instructive, as well as entertaining, to a phi∣losophical
mind. All recreations were in a manner sus∣pended
by the rigid severiy of the presbyterians and
independants. Horse-races and cock-matches were
prohibited as the greatest enormities<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Killing no Murder.</NOTE>. Even bear∣baiting
was esteemed heathenish and unchristian: The
sport of it, not the inhumanity, gave offence. Colonel
Hewson, from his pious zeal, marched with his regi∣ment
into London, and destroyed all the bears, which
were there kept for the diversion of the citizens. This
adventure seems to have given birth to the fiction of
Hudibras. Though the English nation be naturally
candid and sincere, hypocrisy prevailed beyond any ex∣ample
in antient or modern times. The religious hy∣pocrisy,
it may be remarked, is of a singular nature;
and being generally unknown to the person himself,
though more dangerous, it implies less falshood than
any other species of insincerity. The Old Testament,
preferably to the New, was the favourite of all the sec∣taries.
The eastern poetical style of that composition
made it more easily susceptible of a turn, which was
agreeable to them.</P>
<P>WE have had occasion, in the course of this work,
to speak of many of the sects, which prevailed in Eng∣land:
To enumerate them all would be impossible.
The quakers, however, are so considerable, at least so
singular, as to merit some attention; and as they en∣tirely
renounced by principle the use of arms, they
<PB N="342" REF="436"/>
never made such a figure in public transactions as to
enter into any part of our narration.</P>
<P>THE religion of the quakers began with the lowest
vulgar, and, in its progress, came at last to compre∣hend
people of better quality and fashion. George
Fox, born at Drayton in Lancashire in 1624, was the
founder of this sect. He was the son of a weaver, and
was himself bound apprentice to a shoemaker. Feel∣ing
a stronger turn towards spiritual contemplations
than towards that mechanical profession, he lest his
master, and went about the country, cloathed in a
leathern doublet, a dress, which he long affected, as
well for its singularity as its cheapness. That he might
wean himself entirely from sublunary objects, he broke
off all connexions with his friends and family, and
never stayed a moment in one place; le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t habitude
should beget new connexions, and depress the sublimity
of his aerial meditations. He frequently wandered into
the woods, and passed whole days in hollow trees,
without other company or amusement than his bible.
Having reached that pitch of perfection that he needed
no other book, he soon advanced to another state of
spiritual progress, and began to pay less regard even to
that divine composition itself. His own breast, he
imagined, was full of the same inspiration, which had
guided the prophets and apostles themselves; and by
this inward light must every spiritual obscurity be
cleared, by this living spirit must the dead letter be
animated.</P>
<P>WHEN he had been sufficiently consecrated in his
own imagination, he felt that the fumes of self-applause
soon dissipate, if not continually supplied by the admi∣ration
of others; and he began to seek proselytes. Pro∣selytes
were easily gained, at a time when all mens af∣fections
were turned towards religion, and when the
<PB N="343" REF="437"/>
most extravagant modes of it were sure to be the most
popular. All the forms of ceremony, invented by pride
and ostentation, Fox and his disciples, from a superior
pride and ostentation, carefully rejected: Even the or∣dinary
rites of civility were shunned, as the nourish∣ment
of carnal vanity and self-conceit. They would
bestow no titles of distinction: The name of <HI>friend</HI> was
the only salutation, with which they indiscriminately
accosted every one. To no person would they make a
bow, or move their hat, or give any signs of reverence.
Instead of that affected adulation, introduced into mo∣dern
tongues, of speaking to individuals as if they were
a multitude, they returned to the simplicity of antient
languages; and <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI> were the only expressions,
which, on any consideration, they could be brought to
employ.</P>
<P>DRESS too, a most material circumstance, distin∣guished
the members of this sect. Every superfluity and
ornament was carefully retrenched: No plaits to their
coat, no buttons to their sleeves: No lace, no ruffles,
no embroidery. Even a button to the hat, though
sometimes useful, yet not being always so, was univer∣sally
rejected by them with horror and indignation.</P>
<P>THE violent enthusiasm of this sect, like all high
passions, being too strong for the weak nerves to sustain,
threw the preachers into convulsions, and shakings, and
distortions in their limbs; and they thence received the
denomination of <HI>quakers.</HI> Amidst the great toleration,
which was then granted to all sects, and even encou∣ragement
given to all innovation, this sect alone suf∣fered
persecution. From the fury of their zeal, the
quakers broke into churches, disturbed public worship,
and harrassed the minister and audience with railing and
reproaches. When carried before a magistrate, they re∣fused
him all reverence, and treated him with the same
familiarity as if he had been their equal. Sometimes they
<PB N="344" REF="438"/>
were thrown into mad-houses, sometimes into prison:
Sometimes whipped, sometimes pilloryed. The patience
and magnanimity, with which they suffered, begot
compassion, admiration, esteem<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The following story is told by Whitlocke, p. 599. Some quakers at Hasington in Northumberland coming to the minister on the sabbath day, and speaking to him, the people fell upon the quakers, and almost killed one or two of them, who going out fell on their knees, and prayed God to pardon the people, who knew not what they did; and afterwards speaking to the people, so convinced them of the evil they had done in beating them, that the country people sell a quarrelling, and beat one another more than they had before beaten the quakers.</NOTE>. A supernatural spirit
was believed to support them under those sufferings,
which the ordinary state of humanity, freed from the
illusions of passion, is unable to sustain.</P>
<P>THE quakers crept into the army: But as they
preached universal peace, they seduced the military zea∣lots
from their profession, and would soon, had they
been suffered, have put an end, without any defeat or
calamity, to the dominion of the saints. These attempts
became a fresh ground of persecution, and a new cause
for their progress among the people.</P>
<P>MORALS with this sect were carried, or affected to
be carried, to the same degree of extravagance as reli∣gion.
Give a quaker a blow on one cheek, he held
up the other: Ask his cloke, he gave you his coat also:
The greatest interest could not engage him, in any
court of judicature, to swear even to the truth: He
never asked more for his wares than the precise sum,
which he was determined to accept. This last maxim
is laudable, and continues still to be religiously observed
by that sect.</P>
<P>NO fanatics ever carried farther the hatred of ceremo∣nies,
forms, orders, rites, institutions. Even baptism
and the Lord's supper, by all other sects believed to be
interwoven with the very vitals of christianity, were
disdainfully rejected by them. The very sabbath they
<PB N="345" REF="439"/>
profaned. The holiness of churches they derided; and
would give to these sacred edifices no other appellation
than that of <HI>shops</HI> or <HI>steeple-houses.</HI> No priests were ad∣mitted
in their sect: Every one had received from im∣mediate
illumination a character much superior to the
sacerdotal. When they met for divine worship, each
rose up in his place, and delivered the extemporary in∣spirations
of the spirit: Women also were admitted to
teach the brethren, and were considered as proper vehi∣cles
to convey the dictates of the Holy Ghost. Some∣times
a great many preachers were moved to speak at
once: Sometimes a total silence prevailed in their con∣gregations.</P>
<P>SOME quakers attempted to fast forty days in imitation
of Christ; and one of them bravely perished in the ex∣periment<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 624.</NOTE>.
A female quaker came naked into the
church where the Protector sate; being moved by the
spirit, as she said, to appear <HI>as a sign</HI> to the people. A
number of them fancied, that the renovation of all
things had commenced, and that cloaths were to be re∣jected
together with other superfluities. The suffer∣ings,
which followed the practice of this doctrine, were
a species of persecution not well calculated for promot∣ing
it.</P>
<P>JAMES NAYLOR was a quaker, noted for blasphemy,
or rather madness, in the time of the Protectorship.
He fancied that he himself was transformed into Christ,
and was become the real Saviour of the world; and in
consequence of this frenzy, he endeavoured to imitate
many actions of our Saviour related in the evangelists.
As he bore a resemblance to the common pictures of
Christ; he allowed his beard to grow in a like form:
He pretended to raise a person from the dead<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Harleyan Miscellany, vol. vi. p. 399.</NOTE>: He en∣tered
Bristol, mounted on a horse; I suppose, from the
<PB N="346" REF="440"/>
difficulty in that place of finding an ass: His disciples
spread their garments before him, and cried, “Hosanna
to the highest; holy, holy is the Lord God of Sab∣baoth.”
When carried before the magistrates, he
would give no other answers to all questions than
“thou hast said it.” What is remarkable, the parlia∣ment
thought that the matter deserved their attention.
About ten days they spent in enquiries and debates about
him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. v. p. 708.</NOTE>. They condemned him to be pilloried, whipt,
burned in the face, and to have his tongue bored thro'
with a red hot iron. All these severities he bore with
the usual patience. So far his delusion supported him.
But the sequel spoiled all. He was sent to Bridewell,
confined to hard labour, fed on bread and water, de∣barred
from all his disciples, male and female. His il∣lusions
dissipated; and after some time, he was con∣tented
to come out an ordinary man, and return to
his ordinary occupations.</P>
<P>THE chief taxes in England, during the time of the
Commonwealth, were the monthly assessments, the ex∣cise,
and the customs. The assessments were levied on
personal estates as well as on land<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Scobel. p. 419.</NOTE>; and commissioners
were appointed in each county for rating the indivi∣duals.
The highest assessment amounted to 120,000
pounds a month in England; the lowest was 35000.
The assessments in Scotland were sometimes 10,000
pounds a month<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 476.</NOTE>; commonly 6000. Those on Ire∣land
9000. At a medium, this tax might have afforded
about a million a year. The excise, during the civil
wars, was levied on bread, flesh-meat, as well as beer,
ale, strong-waters, and many other commodities. After
the King was subdued, bread and flesh-meat were ex∣empted
from excise. The customs on exportation were
lowered in 1656<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Scobel, p. 376.</NOTE>. In 1650, commissioners were ap∣pointed
<PB N="347" REF="441"/>
to levy both customs and excises. Cromwel in
1657 returned to the old practice of farming. Eleven
hundred thousand pounds were then offered, both for
customs and excise, a greater sum than had ever been
levyed by the commissioners<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 425.</NOTE>. The whole of the taxes
during that period might at a medium amount to above
two millions a year; a sum, which, though mode∣rate,
much exceeded the revenue of any former King.
Sequestrations, compositions, sale of crown and church
lands, and of the lands of delinquents, yielded also con∣siderable
sums, but very difficult to be estimated.
Church lands are said to have been sold at a million<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Dr. Walker, p. 14.</NOTE>.
None of these were ever valued at above ten or eleven
years purchase<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 753.</NOTE>. Delinquents' estates amounted to
above 200,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>. Cromwel died above
two millions in debt<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 667.</NOTE>; though the parliament had left
him in the treasury above 500,000 pounds; and in
stores, the value of 700,000 pounds<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">World's Mistake in Oliver Cromwel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Committee of Danger in April 1648, voted to
raise the army to 40,000 men<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 298.</NOTE>. The same year, the
pay of the army was estimated at 80,000 pounds a
month<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 378.</NOTE>. The establishment of the army in 1652, was
in Scotland 15,000 foot, 2580 horse, 560 dragoons;
in England, 4700 foot, 2520 horse, garrisons 6154. In
all, 31,519, besides officers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Journal, 2d of December, 1652.</NOTE>. The army in Scotland
was afterwards considerably reduced. The army in
Ireland was not much short of 20,000 men; so that
upon the whole, the Commonwealth maintained in
1652 a standing army of more than 50,000 men. Its
pay amounted to a yearly sum of 1,047,715 pounds<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.
Afterwards the Protector reduced the establishment to
<PB N="348" REF="442"/>
30,000 men; as appears by the Instrument of Govern∣ment
and Humble Petition and Advice. His frequent
enterprizes obliged him from time to time to augment
them. Richard had on foot in England an army of
13258 men, in Scotland 9506, in Ireland about 10,000
men<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Journal, 6th of April, 1659.</NOTE>. The foot soldiers had commonly a shilling a
day<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 395. vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>. The horse had two shillings and six-pence; so
that many gentlemen and younger brothers of good fa∣mily
inlisted in the Protector's cavalry<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gumble's Life of Monk.</NOTE>. No wonder,
that such men were averse from the re-establishment of
civil government, by which, they well knew, they must
be deprived of so gainful a profession.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time of the battle of Worcester, the par∣liament
had on foot about 80,000 men, partly mili<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia,
partly regular forces. The vigour of the Common∣wealth,
and the great capacity of those members, who
had assumed the administration, never at any time ap∣peared
so conspicuous<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 477.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE whole revenue of the public during the Protec∣torship
of Richard was estimated at 1,868,717 pounds:
His annual expences at 2,201,540 pounds. An addi∣tional
revenue was demanded of the parliament<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Journal, 7th of April, 1659.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commerce and industry of England increased
extremely during the peaceable period of Charles's reign:
The trade to the East-Indies and to Guinea became
considerable. The English possessed almost the sole
trade with Spain. Seven hundred thousand pounds a
a year in bullion were coined in the English mint.
Twenty thousand cloths were annually sent to Turkey<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Stafford's Let∣ters, vol. i. p. 421, 423, 430, 467.</NOTE>.
Commerce met with interruption, no doubt, from the
civil wars and convulsions, which afterwards prevailed;
<PB N="349" REF="443"/>
though it soon recovered after the establishment of the
Commonwealth. The war with the Dutch, by distres∣sing
the commerce of so formidable a rival, served to en∣courage
trade in England: The Spanish war was in an
equal degree pernicious. All the effects of the English
merchants, to an immense value, were con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscated in
Spain. The prevalence of democratical principles en∣gaged
the country gentlemen to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind their sons appren∣tices
to merchants<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE>; and commerce has ever since been
more honourable in England than in any other Euro∣pean
kingdom. The exclusive companies, which for∣merly
confined trade, were never expressly abolished by
any ordinance of parliament during the Commonwealth;
but as men payed no regard to the prerogative, whence
the charter of these companies were derived, the mo∣nopoly
was gradually invaded, and commerce increased
by the increase of liberty. Interest in 1650 was reduced
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix per cent.</P>
<P>THE colony of New England increased by means of
the puritans, who fled thither, in order to free them∣selves
from the constraint, which Laud and the church
party had imposed upon them; and before the com∣mencement
of the civil wars, it is supposed to have con∣tained
25,000 souls<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">British Empire in America, vol. i. p. 372.</NOTE>. For a like reason, the catholics,
afterwards, who found themselves exposed to many hard∣ships,
and dreaded still worse treatment, went over to
America in great numbers, and settled the colony of
Maryland.</P>
<P>BEFORE the civil wars, learning and the fine arts
were favoured at court, and a good taste began to pre∣vail
in the nation. The King loved pictures, sometimes
handled the pencil himself, and was a good judge of the
art. The pieces of foreign masters were bought up at a
vast price; and the value of pictures doubled in Europe
by the emulation between Charles and Philip IV. of
<PB N="350" REF="444"/>
Spain, who was touched with the same elegant passion.
Vandyke was caressed and enriched at court. Inigo
Jones was master of the King's buildings; though af∣terwards
persecuted by the parliament on account of the
part, which he had in rebuilding St. Paul's, and for
obeying some orders of council, by which he was di∣rected
to pull down houses, in order to make room for
that fabric. Laws, who had not been surpassed by any
musician before him, was much beloved by the King,
who called him the father of music. Charles was a
good judge of writing, and was esteemed by some more
anxious with regard to purity of style than became a
monarch<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bishop Burnet's History of his own Times.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding his narrow revenue, and
his freedom from all vanity, he lived in such magnifi∣cence,
that he possessed four and twenty palaces, all of
them elegantly and compleatly furnished; insomuch,
that, when he removed from one to another, he was
not obliged to transport any thing along with him.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, though himself a barbarian, was not in∣sensible
to literary merit. Usher, notwithstanding his
being a bishop, received a pension from him. Marvel
and Milton were in his service. Waller, who was his
relation, was caressed by him. That poet always said,
that the Protector himself was not so wholly illiterate as
was commonly imagined. He gave a hundred pounds a
year to the divinity professor at Oxford; and an histo∣rian
mentions this bounty as an instance of his love of
literature<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Neale's History of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tans, vol. iv. p. 123.</NOTE>. He intended to have erected a college at
Durham for the benefit of the northern counties.</P>
<P>CIVIL WARS, especially when founded on principles
of liberty, are not commonly unfavourable to the arts of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loquence and composition; or rather, by presenting
nobler and more interesting objects, they amply com∣pensate
for that tranquillity, of which they bereave the
<PB N="351" REF="445"/>
muses. The speeches of the parliamentary orators dur∣ing
this period, are of a strain much superior to what
any former age had produced in England; and the force
and compass of our tongue were then first put to trial.
It must however be confessed, that the wretched fanati∣cism,
which so much infected the parliamentary party,
was no less destructive of taste and science, than of all
law and order. Gaity and wit were proscribed: Hu∣man
learning despised: Freedom of enquiry detested:
Cant and hypocrisy alone encouraged. It was an ar∣ticle
positively insisted on in the preliminaries to the
treaty of Uxbrige, that all play-houses should for ever
be abolished. Sir John Davenant, says Whitlocke<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">P. 639.</NOTE>,
speaking of the year 1658, published an opera, not∣withstanding
the nicety of the times. All the King's
furniture was put to sale: His pictures, disposed of at
very low prices, enriched all the collections of Europe:
Even his palaces were pulled to pieces, and the materials
of them sold. The very library and medals at St.
James's, was intended by the Generals to be brought
to auction, in order to pay the arrears of some regi∣ments
of cavalry, quartered near London: But Selden,
apprehensive of this loss, engaged his friend Whitlocke,
then Lord-Keeper for the Commonwealth, to apply for
the office of Librarian. This contrivance saved that
valuable collection.</P>
<P>'TIS however remarkable, that the greatest genius by
far, which shone forth in England during this period,
was deeply engaged with these fanatics, and even pro∣stituted
his pen in theological controversy, in factious
disputes, and in justifying the most violent measures of
the party. This was John Milton, whose poems are ad∣mirable,
though liable to some objections; his prose
writings disagreeable, though not altogether defective in
genius. Nor are all his poems equal: His Paradise
<PB N="352" REF="446"/>
Lost, his Comus, and a few others, shine out amidst
some flat and insipid compositions: Even in the Paradise
Lost, his capital performance, there are very long pas∣sages,
amounting to near a third of the work, almost
wholly devoid of harmony and elegance, nay, of all vi∣gour
of imagination. The natural inequality in Mil∣ton's
genius was much increased by the inequalities in
his subject; of which some parts are of themselves the
most lofty that can enter into human conception,
others would have required the most laboured elegance
of composition to support them. It is certain, that this
author, when in a happy mood, and employed on a
noble subject, is the most wonderfully sublime of any
poet in any language; Homer and Lucretius and Tasso
not excepted. More concise than Homer, more simple
than Tasso, more nervous than Lucretius; had he lived
in a latter age, and learned to polish some ruden<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss in
his verses; had he enjoyed better fortune, and possessed
leisure to watch the returns of genius in himself; he
had attained the pinnacle of human perfection, and
borne away the palm of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pic poetry.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that Milton never enjoyed in his
life-time the reputation which he deserved. His Para∣dise
Lost was long neglected: Prejudices against an
apologist for the regicides, and against a work not
wholly purged of the cant of former times, kept the
ignorant world from perceiving the prodigious merit of
that performance. Lord Somers, by encouraging a
good edition of it, about twenty years after the author's
death, first brought it into reputation; and Tonson, in
his dedication of a smaller edition, speaks of it as a
work just beginning to be known. Even during the
prevalence of Milton's party, he seems never to have
been much regarded; and Whitlocke<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P. 633.</NOTE> talks of one
Milton, as he calls him, a blind man, who was em∣ployed
<PB N="353" REF="447"/>
in translating a treaty with Sweden into Latin.
These forms of expression are amusing to posterity, who
consider how obscure Whitlocke himself, though Lord-Keeper
and Ambassador, and indeed a man of great abi∣lity
and merit, has become in comparison of Milton.</P>
<P>IT was not strange, that Milton received no encou∣ragement
after the restoration: It was more to be admir∣ed,
that he escaped with his life. Many of the cavaliers
blamed extremely that lenity towards him, which was
so honourable in the King, and so advantageous to
posterity. It is said, that he had saved Davenant's life
during the Protectorship; and Davenant in return af∣fored
him like protection after the restoration; being
sensible, that men of letters ought always to regard their
sympathy of taste as a more powerful band of union,
than any difference of party or opinion as a source of
animosity. It was during a state of poverty, blindness,
disgrace, danger, and old age, that Milton composed
his wonderful poem, which not only surpassed all the
performances of his cotemporaries, but all the compo∣sitions,
which had flowed from his pen, during the vi∣gor
of his age, and the height of his prosperity. This
circumstance is not the least remarkable of all those
which attend that great genius.</P>
<P>WALLER was the first refiner of English poetry, at
least of English rhyme; but his performances still
abound with many faults, and what is more material,
they contain but feeble and superficial beauties. Gaiety,
wit, and ingenuity are their ruling character: They
aspire not to the sublime; still less to the pathetic.
They treat of love, without making us feel any ten∣derness;
and abound in panegyric, without exciting
admiration. The panegyric however on Cromwel,
contains more force than we should expect from the
other compositions of this poet.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="448"/>
WALLER was born to an ample fortune, was early in∣troduced
to the court, and lived in the best company.
He possessed talents for eloquence as well as poetry;
and till his death, which happened in a good old age,
he was the delight of the house of commons. The er∣rors
of his life proceeded more from want of courage
than of honour or integrity.</P>
<P>COWLEY is an author extremely corrupted by the
bad taste of his age; but had he lived even in the
purest times of Greece and Rome, he must always have
been a very indifferent poet. He had no ear for har∣mony;
and his verses are only known to be such by the
rhyme, which terminates them. In his rugged untune∣able
numbers are conveyed sentiments the most strained
and violent; long spun allegories, distant allusions, and
forced conceits. Great ingenuity, however, and force
of thought sometimes break out amidst those unnatural
conceptions: A few anacreontics surprise us by their
ease and gaiety: His prose writings please, by the ho∣nesty
and goodness which they express; and even by
their spleen and melancholy. This author was much
more praised and admired during his life time, and cele∣brated
after his death, than the great Milton.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN DENHAM in his Cooper's Hill (for none
of his other poems merit attention) has a loftiness and
vigor, which had not before him been attained by any
English poet, who wrote in rhyme. The mechanical
difficulties of that measure retarded its improvement.
Shakespeare, whose tragic scenes are so wonderfully
forcible and expressive, is a very indifferent poet, when
he attempts rhyme. Precision and neatness are chiefly
wanting in Denham.</P>
<P>NO author in that age was more c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lebrated both abroad
and at home than Hobbes: In our times, he is much
neglected: A lively instance, how pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>carious all repu∣tations,
<PB N="355" REF="449"/>
founded on reasoning and philosophy! A plea∣sant
comedy, which paints the manners of the age,
and exposes a faithful picture of nature, is a durable
work, and is transmitted to the latest posterity. But a
system, whether physical or metaphysical, owes com∣monly
its success to its novelty; and is no sooner can∣vassed
with impartiality than its weakness is discovered.
Hobbes's politics are fitted only to promote tyranny,
and his ethics to encourage licentiousness. Though an
enemy to religion, he partakes nothing of the spirit of
scepticism; but is as positive and dogmatical as if human
reason, and his reason in particular, could attain a
thorough conviction on these subjects. Clearness and
propriety of style are the chief excellencies of Hobbes's
writings. In his own person he is represented to have
been a man of virtue; a character no wise surprising,
notwithstanding his libertine system of ethics. Timi∣dity
is the principal fault with which he is reproached:
He lived to an extreme old age, yet could never recon∣cile
himself to the thoughts of death. The boldness of
his opinions and sentiments, form a remarkable con∣trast
to this part of his character.</P>
<P>HARRINGTON's Ocena was well adapted to that age,
when the plans of imaginary republics were the daily
subjects of debate and conversation; and even in our
time it is justly admired as a work of genius and inven∣tion.
The idea however of a perfect and immortal
Commonwealth will always be found as chimerical as
that of a perfect and immortal man. The style of this
author wants ease and fluency; but the good matter,
which his work contains, makes ample compensation.</P>
<P>HARVEY is intitled to the glory of having made, by
reasoning alone, without any mixture of accident, a
capital discovery in one of the most important branches
of science. He had also the happiness of establishing at
once his theory on the most solid and convincing proofs;
<PB N="356" REF="450"/>
and posterity has added little to the arguments suggested
by his industry and ingenuity. His treatise of the cir∣culation
of the blood is farther embellished by that
warmth and spirit, which so naturally accompany the
genius of invention. This great man was much fa∣voured
by Charles the first, who gave him the liberty
of using all the deer in the royal forests for perfecting
his discoverics on the generation of animals.</P>
<P>THIS age affords great materials for history; but did
not produce any accomplished historian. Clarendon,
however, will always be esteemed an entertaining author,
even independant of our curiosity to know the facts,
which he relates. His style is prolix and redundant,
and suffocates us by the length of its periods: But it
discovers imagination and sentiment, and pleases us at
the same time that we disapprove of it. He is more partial
in appearance than in reality: For he seems perpetually
anxious to apologize for the King; but his apologies
are often well grounded. He is less partial in his rela∣tion
of facts, than in his account of characters: He
was too honest a man to falsify the former; his affec∣tions
were easily capable, unknown to himself, of dis∣guising
the latter. An air of probity and goodness runs
through the whole work; as these qualities did in reality
embellish the whole life of the author.</P>
<P>THESE are the chief performances, which engage
the attention of posterity. Those numberless produc∣tions,
with which the press then abounded; the cant
of the pulpit, the declamations of party, the subtilties
of theology; all these have long ago sunk into silence
and oblivion. Even a writer, such as Selden, whose
learning was his chief excellency; or Chillingworth,
an accute disputant against the papists, will scarce ever
be ranked among the classics of our language or coun∣try.</P>

<P>CHARLES the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXIII.</NOTE> when he ascended the
throne of his ancestors, was thirty years of age.
He possessed a vigorous constitution, a fine shape, a
manly figure, a graceful air; and though his features
were harsh, yet was his countenance in the main lively
and engaging. He was in that period of life, when
there remains enough of youth to render the person ami∣able,
without diminishing that authority and regard,
which attend the years of experience and maturity.
Tenderness was excited by the memory of his recent
adversities. His present prosperity was the object rather
of admiration than of envy. And as the sudden and
<PB N="358" REF="452"/>
surprising revolution, which restored him to his regal
rights, had also restored the nation to peace, law, or∣der,
and liberty; no prince ever obtained a crown in
more favourable circumstances, or was more blest with
the cordial affection and attachment of his subjects.</P>
<P>THIS popularity, the King, by his whole demeanor
and behaviour, was well qualified to support and to in∣crease.
To a lively wit and quick comprehension, he
united a just understanding and a general observation
both of men and things. The easiest manners, the
most unaffected politeness, the most engaging gaiety ac∣companied
his conversation and address. Accustomed
during his exile to live among his courtiers rather like a
companion than a monarch, he retained, even while on
the throne, that open affability, which was capable of
reconciling the most determined republicans to his royal
dignity. Totally devoid of resentment, as well from
the natural lenity as carelessness of his temper, he in∣sured
pardon to the most guilty of his enemies, and left
hopes of favour to his most violent opponents. From
the whole tenor of his actions and discourse, he seemed
desirous of losing the memory of past animosities, and
of uniting every party in an affection for their prince
and their country.</P>
<P>INTO his council were admitted the most eminent<NOTE PLACE="marg">New mini∣stry.</NOTE>
men of the nation, without regard to former distinc∣tions:
The presbyterians, equally with the royalists,
shared this honour. Annesley was also created Earl of
Anglesey; Ashley Cooper Lord Ashley; Denzil Hollis
Lord Hollis. The Earl of Manchester was appointed
Lord Chamberlain, and Lord Say Privy Seal. Calamy
and Baxter, presbyterian clergymen, were even made
Chaplains to the King.</P>
<P>ADMIRAL MONTAGUE, created Earl of Sandwich,
was entitled from his recent services to great favour;
<PB N="359" REF="453"/>
and he obtained it. Monk, created Duke of Albe∣marle,
had performed such signal services, that, accord∣ing
to a vulgar and malignant observation, he ought
rather to have expected hatred and ingratitude: Yet
was he ever treated by the King with great marks of
distinction. Charles's disposition, free from jealousy;
and the prudent behaviour of the General, who never
over-rated his merits; prevented all those disgusts,
which naturally arise in so delicate a situation. The
capacity too of Albemarle was not extensive, nor
were his parts shining. Though he had distinguished
himself in inferior stations, he was found, upon fami∣liar
acquaintance, to be unequal to those great at∣chievements,
which fortune had enabled him to per∣form;
and he appeared unfit for the court, a scene of
life to which he had never been accustomed. Morrice,
his friend, was created Secretary of State, and was sup∣ported
more by his patron's credit than by his own abi∣lity
or experience.</P>
<P>BUT the choice, which the King at first made of his
principal ministers and favourites, was the circum∣stance,
which chiefly gave contentment to the nation,
and prognosticated future happiness and tranquillity.
Sir Edward Hyde, created Earl of Clarendon, was
Chancellor and Prime Minister: The Marquess, created
Duke, of Ormond, was Lord Steward of the House∣hold:
The Earl of Southampton, High Treasurer:
Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary of State. These men,
united together in the strictest friendship, and combin∣ing
in the same laudable inclinations, supported each
others credit, and pursued the interest of the public.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to the present prosperity of public affairs
was the universal joy and festivity diffused throughout
the nation. The melancholy austerity of the fanatics
fell into discredit together with their principles. The
royalists, who had ever affected a contrary disposition,
<PB N="360" REF="454"/>
found in their recent success new motives for mirth
and gaiety; and it now belonged to them to give re∣pute
and fashion to their manners. From past expe∣rience
it had sufficiently appeared, that gravity was very
distinct from wisdom, formality from virtue, and hypo∣crisy
from religion. The King himself, who bore a
strong propensity to pleasure and society, served, by his
powerful and engaging example, to banish those sour
and malignant humours, which had hitherto engendered
such confusion. And though the just bounds were un∣doubtedly
passed, when men return from their former
extreme; yet was the public happy in exchanging
vices pernicious to society for disorders hurtful chiefly
to the individuals themselves, who were guilty of
them.</P>
<P>IT required some time before the several parts of the
state, disfigured by war and faction, could recover their
former arrangement: But the parliament immediately
entered into a good correspondence with the King, and
they treated him with the same dutiful regard, which
had usually been payed to his predecessors. Being sum∣moned
without the King's consent, they received, at
first, only the title of a convention; and it was not
till the King passed an act for that purpose, that they
were called by the appellation of parliament. All judi∣cial
proceedings, transacted in the name of the Com∣monwealth
or Protector, they thought it requisite to ra∣tify
by a new law. And both houses acknowledging
the guilt of the former rebellion, in their own name and
in that of all the subjects, laid hold of his Majesty's gra∣cious
pardon and indemnity.</P>
<P>THE King, before his restoration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of in∣demity.</NOTE> being afraid of re∣ducing
any of his enemies to despair, and at the same
time unwilling that such enormous crimes as had been
committed, should receive a total impunity, had ex∣pressed
himself very cautiously in his declaration of
<PB N="361" REF="455"/>
Breda, and had promised an indemnity to all criminals,
but such as should be excepted by the parliament. He
now issued a proclamation, declaring that such of the
late King's judges as did not yield themselves prisoners
within fourteen days should receive no pardon. Nine∣teen
surrendered themselves: Some were taken in their
flight: Others escaped beyond sea.</P>
<P>THE Commons seem to have been more inclined to
lenity than the Lords. The upper house, inflamed with
the ill usage, which they had received, were resolved,
besides the late King's judges, to except every one, who
had sat in any high court of justice. Nay, the Earl of
Bristol moved, that no pardon might be granted to those
who had any way contributed to the King's death. So
wide an exception, in which every one, who had served
the parliament, might be comprehended, gave a general
alarm; and men began to apprehend, that this motion
was the effect of some court artifice or intrigue. But
the King soon dissipated these fears. He came to the
house of Peers; and in the most earnest terms, pressed
the act of general indemnity. He urged both the ne∣cessity
of the thing, and the obligation of his former
promise: A promise, he said, which he would ever re∣gard
as sacred; since to it he probably owed the satisfac∣tion,
which at present he enjoyed, of meeting his peo∣ple
in parliament. This measure of the King, though
irregular, by his taking notice of a bill which depended
before the houses, was received with great applause and
satisfaction.</P>
<P>AFTER repeated sollicitations from the King, the act
of indemnity passed both houses, and soon received
the royal assent. Those who had an immediate hand
in the King's death, were there excepted: Even Crom∣wel,
Ireton, Bradshaw, and others now dead were at∣tainted,
and their estates forseited. Vane and Lambert,
tho' none of the King's judges, were also excepted. St.
<PB N="362" REF="456"/>
John and seventeen persons more were deprived of all
benefit from this act, if they ever accepted any public
employment. All who had sat in any illegal high
court of justice were disabled from bearing offices.
These were all the severities, which followed such furi∣ous
civil wars and convulsions.</P>
<P>THE next business was the settlement of the King's
revenue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the re∣venue.</NOTE> In this work, the parliament had regard to
public freedom as well as to the support of the crown.
The tenures of wards and liverics had long been re∣garded
as a grievance by all lovers of liberty: Several
attempts had been made during the reign of James to
purchase this prerogative together with that of purvey∣ance;
and 200,000 pounds a year had been offered
that Prince in lieu of them. During the time of the
republic, wardships and purveyance had been utterly
abolished. And even in the present parliament, before
the King arrived in England, a bill had been introdu∣ced,
offering him a compensation for these revenues. A
hundred thousand pounds a year was the sum, which
the parliament agreed to; and half of the excise was
settled in perpetuity upon the crown as the fund whence
that revenue should be levied. Though that impost
yielded more profit, the bargain might be esteemed hard;
and it was chiefly the necessity of the King's situation,
which induced him to consent to it. No request of the
parliament, during the present joy, could be refused
them.</P>
<P>NOT only the power of the crown, by means of
wardships and purveyance, was very considerable: It
was also unequal and personal; and consequently, of a
nature unsuitable to a monarchy, subjected to strict and
regular limitations. The uniformity, therefore, of the
political system seemed to require the abolition of these
Gothic institutions; though it might perhaps appear
<PB N="363" REF="457"/>
unjust, that an advantage, which chiefly resulted to the
proprietors of land, should be purchased by an impost,
that affected every inhabitant of the kingdom.</P>
<P>TONNAGE and poundage and the other half of the
excise were granted to the King during life. The par∣liament
even proceeded so far as to vote that the settled
revenue of the crown for all charges should be 1200,000
pounds a year; a sum larger than any English monarch
had ever before enjoyed. The late King's revenue
from 1637 to the meeting of the long parliament ap∣peared
to be at a medium near 900,000 pounds a year;
of which 200,000 pounds arose from branches, partly
illegal, partly expired. The misfortunes of that Prince
were now believed to have proceeded originally from the
narrowness of his revenue, and from the obstinacy of
his parliaments, who had refused him the necessary
supply. And as all the monarchs of Europe were per∣petually
augmenting their forces, and consequently
their expences, it became requisite that England, from
motives both of honour and security, should bear some
proportion to them, and adapt its revenue to the new
system of politics, which prevailed. According to the
Chancellor's computation, a charge of 800,000 pounds
a year, was at present required for the fleet and other
articles, which formerly cost the crown but eighty thou∣sand.</P>
<P>HAD the parliament, before restoring the King, in∣sisted
on any farther limitations than those which the
constitution already imposed; besides the danger of in∣flaming
the antient quarrels among parties; it would
seem, that their caution had been entirely superfluous.
By reason of its slender and precarious revenue, the
crown in effect was still totally dependant. Not a
fourth part of this sum, which seemed requisite for pub∣lic
expences, could be levied without consent of parlia∣ment;
and any concessions, had they been thought ne∣cessary,
<PB N="364" REF="458"/>
might, even after the restoration, be extorted
by the Commons from their necessitous Prince. This
parliament showed no intention of employing at present
that engine to any such purposes; but they seemed still
determined not to part with it entirely, or to render the
revenues of the crown fixed and independant. Though
they voted in general, that 1200,000 pounds a year
should be settled on the King, they assigned not any
funds, which could yield two thirds of that sum. And
they left the care of fulfilling their engagements to the
future consideration of parliament.</P>
<P>IN all the temporary supplies, which they voted, they
discovered the same cautious frugality. To disband the
army, so formidable in itself, and so much accustomed
to rebellion and changes of government, was necessary
for the security both of King and parliament; yet the
Commons showed great jealousy in granting the sums,
requisite for that purpose. An assessment of 70,000
pounds a month was imposed: but it was at first voted,
to continue only for three months: And all the other
sums, which, by a poll-bill and new assessments, they
levied for that use, they still granted by parcels; as if
they were not, as yet, well assured of the fidelity of
that hand, to which the money was committed. Hav∣ing
proceeded so far in the settlement of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> the
parliament adjourned themselves for some time.</P>
<P>DURING the recess of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of the regicides.</NOTE> the object, which
chiefly interested the public, was the trial and condem∣nation
of the regicides. The general indignation,
which attended the enormous crime, of which these men
had been guilty, made their sufferings the subject of
joy to the people: But in the peculiar circumstances of
that action, in the prejudices of the times, as well as
in the behaviour of the criminals, a mind, seasoned
with humanity, will find a plentiful source of compas∣sion
and indulgence. Can any one, without the ut∣most
<PB N="365" REF="459"/>
concern for human blindness and ignorance, con∣sider
the demeanor of General Harrison, who was first
brought to his trial? With great courage and elevation
of sentiment, he told the court, that the pretended
crime, of which he stood accused, was not a deed, per∣formed
in a corner: The found of it had gone forth to
most nations; and in the singular and marvellous con∣duct
of it had chiefly appeared the sovereign power
of heaven. That he himself, agitated by doubts, had
often, with passionate tears, offered his addresses to the
divine majesty; and carnestly sought for light and con∣viction:
He had still received assurance of a heavenly
sanction, and returned from these devout supplications
with more serene tranquillity and satisfaction. That all
the nations of the earth, in the eyes of their creator,
were less than a drop of water in the bucket; nor were
their erroneous judgments aught but darkness compared
with divine illuminations. That these frequent illapses
of the divine spirit he could not suspect to be interested
illusions; since he was conscious, that, for no tempo∣ral
advantage, would he offer injury to the poorest man
or woman who trod upon the earth. That all the al∣lurements
of ambition, all the terrors of imprisonment,
had not been able, during the usurpation of Cromwel,
to shake his steddy resolution or bend him to a compli∣ance
with that deceitful tyrant. And that when invited
by him to sit on the right hand of the throne, when
offered riches and splendor and dominion, he had dis∣dainfully
rejected all temptations; and neglecting the
tears of his friends and family, had still, through every
danger, held fast his principles and his integrity.</P>
<P>SCOT, who was more a republican than a fanatic,
had said in the house of Commons, a little before the
restoration, that he desired no other epitaph to be in∣scribed
on his tomb-stone than this; <HI>Here lies Thomas
<PB N="366" REF="460"/>
Scot, who adjudged the King to death.</HI> He supported the
same spirit upon his trial.</P>
<P>CAREW, a Millenarian, submitted to his trial, <HI>saving
to our Lord Jesus Christ his right to the government of these
kingdoms.</HI> Some scrupled to say, according to form,
that they would be tried by God and their country; be∣cause
God was not visibly present to judge them.
Others said, that they would be tried by the word of
God.</P>
<P>NO more than six of the late King's judges, Harri∣son,
Scot, Carew, Clement, Jones, and Scrope, were
executed: Scrope alone, of all those who came in upon
the King's proclamation. He was a gentleman of a
good family and of a decent character: But it was
proved, that he had lately, in conversation, expressed
himself as if he were no wise convinced of his guilt in
condemning the King. Axtel, who had guarded the
high court of justice, Hacker, who commanded on the
day of the King's execution, Coke, the sollicitor for
the people of England, and Hugh Peters, the furious
preacher, who inflamed the army to regicide: All these
were tried, and condemned, and suffered with the
King's judges. No saint nor confessor ever went to
martyrdom with more assured confidence of heaven than
was expressed by those criminals, even when the terrors
of immediate death, joined to many indignities, were
set before them. The rest of the King's judges, by an
unexampled lenity, were reprieved; and they were dis∣persed
into several prisons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Sep∣tember.</NOTE> THIS punishment of declared enemies no wise inter∣rupted
the rejoicings of the court: But the death of
the Duke of Glocester, a young Prince of very pro∣mising
hopes, threw a great cloud upon them. The
King, by no incident in his life, was ever so deeply
<PB N="367" REF="461"/>
affected. Glocester was observed to possess united the
good qualities of both his brothers: The clear judgment
and penetration of the King; the industry and applica∣tion
of the Duke of York. He was also believed to be
affectionate to the religion and constitution of his coun∣try.
He was but twenty years of age, when the small
pox put an end to his life.</P>
<P>THE Princess of Orange, having come to England,
in order to partake of the joy, attending the restora∣tion
of her family, with whom she lived in great
friendship, soon after sickned and died. The Queen-mother
payed a visit to her son; and obtained his con∣sent
to the marriage of the Princess Henrietta, with the
Duke of Orleans, brother to the French King.</P>
<P>AFTER a recess of near two months, the parliament
met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of No∣vember.</NOTE> and proceeded in the great work of the national
settlement. They established the post-office, wine∣licences,
and some articles of the revenue. They
granted more assessments, and some arrears for paying
and disbanding the army. Business, being carried on
with great unanimity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissolution of the Con∣vention Par∣liament. 29th of De∣cember.</NOTE> was soon dispatched: And after
they had sat near two months, the King in a speech
full of the most gracious expressions, thought proper to
dissolve them.</P>
<P>THIS House of Commons had been chosen during the
reign of the old parliamentary party; and though many
royalists had crept in amongst them, yet did it chiefly
consist of presbyterians, who had not yet entirely laid
aside their old jealousies and principles, Lenthal, a
member, having said, that those who first took arms
against the King, were as guilty as those, who after∣wards
brought him to the scaffold, was severely repri∣manded
by order of the house; and the most violent
efforts of the Long Parliament to secure the constitution,
and bring delinquents to justice, were in effect vindicated
<PB N="368" REF="462"/>
and applauded. The claim of the two houses to the
militia, the first ground of the quarrel, however exor∣bitant
an usurpation, this parliament was never brought
expressly to resign. All grants of money they made
with a very sparing hand. Great arrears being due by
the late Protector, to the fleet, the army, the navy-office,
and every branch of service; this whole debt they
threw upon the crown, without establishing funds suffi∣cient
for its payment. Yet notwithstanding this jea∣lous
care expressed by the parliament, there prevails a
story, that Popham, having sounded the disposition of
the members, undertook to the Earl of Southampton to
procure, during the King's life, a grant of two millions
a year, land tax; a sum, which, joined to the customs
and excise, would for ever have rendered this Prince
independant of his people. Southampton, it is said,
merely from his affection to the King, had unwarily
embraced the offer; and it was not till he communi∣cated
the matter to the Chancellor, that he was made
sensible of its pernicious tendency. It is not impro∣bable,
that such an offer might have been made, and
been hearkened to; but it is no wise probable, that all
the interest of the court would ever, with this House of
Commons, have been able to make it effectual. Claren∣don
showed his prudence, no less than his integrity,
in entirely rejecting it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, from the same principles of conduct,
hastened to disband the army. When the King re∣viewed
these veteran troops, he was struck with their
beauty, order, discipline, and martial appearance; and
being sensible, that regular forces are most necessary
implements of royalty, he expressed a desire of finding
expedients still to retain them. But his wise minister
set before him the dangerous spirit by which these troops
were animated, their enthusiastic genius, their habits of
rebellion and mutiny; and he convinced the King,
<PB N="369" REF="463"/>
that till they were disbanded, he never could esteem
himself securely established on his throne. No more
troops were retained than a few guards and garrisons,
about 1000 horse, and 4000 foot. This was the first
appearance, under the monarchy, of a regular standing
army in England. The forti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ications of Glocester,
Taunton, and other towns, which had made resistance
to the King during the civil wars, were also demolish∣ed.</P>
<P>CLARENDON not only behaved with great wisdom
and justice in the office of Chancellor: All the coun∣cils,
which he gave the King, tended equally to pro∣mote
the interest of Prince and people. Charles, ac∣customed
in his exile to pay entire deference to the
judgement of that faithful servant, continued still to
submit to his direction; and for some time no minister
was ever possessed of more absolute authority. He mo∣derated
the forward zeal of the royalists, and tempered
their appetite for revenge. With the opposite party, he
endeavoured to preserve inviolate all the King's engage∣ments:
He kept an exact register of every promise
which had been made for any services, and he employed
all his industry to fulfil them. This good minister was now
very nearly allied to the royal family. His daughter,
Anne Hyde, a woman of spirit and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine accomplish∣ments,
had hearkened, while abroad, to the addresses of
the Duke of York, and under promise of marriage, had
secretly admitted him to her bed. Her pregnancy soon
appeared after the restoration; and though many en∣deavoured
to dissuade the Duke from so unequal an al∣liance,
the King, in pity to his friend and minister,
who had been totally ignorant of these engagements,
obliged his brother to marry her. Clarendon expressed
great uneasiness, at the honour, which he had obtained;
and said, that, by being elevated so much above his
rank, he thence dreaded a more sudden downfal.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="464"/>
MOST circumstances of Clarendon's administration
have met with applause: His maxims alone in the
conduct of ecclesiastical politics have by many been
deemed the effect of prejudices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelacy re∣stored.</NOTE> narrow and bigotted.
Had the jealousy of royal power prevailed so far with
the Convention Parliament as to make them restore the
King upon strict limitations, there is no question but
the establishment of presbyterian discipline had been one
of the conditions most rigidly insisted on. Not only
that form of ecclesiastical government is more favour∣able
to liberty than to royal power: It was likewise on
its own account, agreeable to the majority of the House
of Commons, and suited their religious principles. But
as the impatience of the people, the danger of delay,
the general disgust towards faction, and the authority of
Monk had prevailed over that jealous project of limita∣tions,
the full settlement of the hierarchy, together with
the monarchy, was a necessary and infallible conse∣quence.
All the royalists were zealous for that mode
of religion; the merits of the episcopal clergy towards
the King, as well as their sufferings on that account,
had been very great; the laws, which established bi∣shops
and the liturgy, were as yet unrepealed by legal
authority; and any attempt of the parliament, by new
acts, to give the superiority to presbyterianism, had
been sufficient to involve again the nation in blood and
confusion. Moved by these views, the Commons had
very wisely postponed the examination of all religious
controversy, and had le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t entirely the settlement of the
church to the King and to the antient laws.</P>
<P>THE King at first used great moderation in the exe∣cution
of the laws. Nine bishops still remained alive;
and these were immediately restored to their dioceses:
All the ejected clergy recovered their livings: The li∣turgy,
a form of worship very decent, and not without
beauty, was again admitted into the churches: But at
<PB N="371" REF="465"/>
the same time, a declaration was issued, in order to give
contentment to the presbyterians, and preserve an air of
moderation and neutrality. In that declaration, the
King promised, that he would provide suffragan bishops
for the larger dioceses; that the prelates should, all of
them, be regular and constant preachers; that they
should not confer ordination, or exercise any jurisdic∣tion,
without the advice and assistance of presbyters,
chosen by the diocese; that such alterations should be
made in the liturgy, as would render it totally unexcep∣tionable;
that in the mean time, the use of that mode
of worship should not be imposed on such as were un∣willing
to receive it; and that the surplice, the cross in
baptism, and bowing at the name of Jesus should not
be rigidly insisted on. This declaration the King issued
as head of the church; and he plainly assumed, in many
parts of it, a legislative authority in ecclesiastical mat∣ters.
But the English government, though more exactly
defined by late contests, was not, as yet, reduced, in
every particular, to the strict limits of law. And if
ever prerogative was justifiably employed, it seemed to
be on the present occasion; when all parts of the state
were torne with past convulsions, and required the mo∣derating
hand of the chief magistrate, to reduce them
to their antient order.</P>
<P>BUT though these appearances of neutrality were
maintained, and a mitigated episcopacy only seemed to
be insisted on, it was far from the intention of the mi∣nistry
always to preserve like regard to the presbyterians.
The madness of the Fifth-Monarchy-men afforded them
a pretence for departing from it. Venner, a desperate
enthusiast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrection of the Mille∣narians.</NOTE> who had often conspired against Cromwel,
having, by his zealous lectures, inflamed his own ima∣gination
and that of his followers, issued forth with
them into the streets of London. They were to the
number of sixty, compleatly armed, believed themselves
<PB N="372" REF="466"/>
invulnerable and invincible, and firmly expected the
same fortune, which had attended Gideon and other
heroes of the Old Testament. Every one at first fled
before them. One unhappy man, who, being question∣ed,
said, “He was for God and King Charles,” they
instantly murdered. They went triumphantly from
street to street, every where proclaiming King Jesus,
who, they said, was their invisible leader. At length,
the magistrates, having assembled some train-bands,
made an attack upon them. They defended themselves
with great order as well as valour; and after killing
many of the assailants, they made a regular retreat into
Cane-Wood near Hampstead. Next morning, they
were chaced thence by a detachment of the guards;
but they ventured again to invade the city, which was
not prepared to receive them. After committing great
disorder, and traversing almost every street of that im∣mense
capital, they shut up themselves in a house,
which they were resolute to defend to the last extremity.
Being surrounded, and the house untiled, they were
fired upon from every side; and they still refused quar∣ter.
The people rushed in upon them, and seized the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who were alive. They were tried, condemned, and
executed; and to the last they persisted in affirming,
that, if they were deceived, it was the Lord that had
deceived them.</P>
<P>CLARENDON and the ministry took occasion from
this insurrection to infer the dangerous spirit of the
presbyterians and of all the sectaries: But the madness
of the attempt sufficiently proved, that it had been un∣dertaken
by no concert, and never could have proved
dangerous. The well known hatred too, which pre∣vailed
between the presbyterians and the other sects,
should have removed the former from all suspicion of
any concurrence in the enterprize. But as a pretence
was wanted, besides their old demerits, for justifying
<PB N="373" REF="467"/>
the intended rigours against them, this reason, how∣ever
slight, was very greedily laid hold of.</P>
<P>THE affairs in Scotland hastened with still quicker
steps than those in England towards a settlement and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE>
compliance with the King. It was deliberated in the
English council, whether that nation should be restored
to its liberty, or whether the forts, erected by Crom∣wel,
should not still be upheld, in order to curb the
mutinous spirit, by which the Scots in all ages had
been so much governed. Lauderdale, who from the
battle of Worcester to the restoration, had been detain∣ed
a prisoner in the Tower, had considerable influence
with the King; and he strenuously opposed this violent
measure. He represented, that it was the loyalty of the
Scots nation, which had engaged them in opposition to
the English rebels; and that to take advantage of the
calamities, into which, on that account, they had
fallen, would be regarded as the highest injustice and
ingratitude: That the spirit of that people was now
fully subdued by the long servitude, under which the
usurpers had detained them, and would of itself yield to
any reasonable compliance with their legal sovereign,
if, by his means, they recovered their liberty and ind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pendence:
That the attachment of the Scots towards
their King, whom they regarded as their native Prince,
was naturally much stronger than that of the English;
and would afford him a sure resource, in case of any
rebellion among the latter: That republican principles
had long been, and still were, very prevalent with his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outhern subjects, and might again menace the throne
with new tumults and resistance. That the time would
probably come, when the King, instead of desiring to
se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> English garrisons in Scotland, would be better
pleased to have Scots garrisons in England, who, sup∣ported
by English pay, would be fond to curb the se∣ditious
genius of that opulent nation: And that a
<PB N="374" REF="468"/>
people, such as the Scots, governed by a few nobility,
would more easily be reduced to submission under mo∣narchy,
than one, like the English, who breathed no∣thing
but the spirit of democratical equality.</P>
<P>THESE views induced the King to disband all the
forces in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1661.</NOTE> and to raze all the forts, which had
been erected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Janu∣ary.</NOTE> General Middleton, created Earl of that
name, was sent commissioner to the parliament, which
was summoned. A very compliant spirit was there dis∣covered
in all orders of men. The commissioner had
even sufficient influence to obtain an act, annulling, at
once, all laws, which had passed since the year 1633;
on pretext of the violence, which, during that time,
had been employed against the King and his father, in
order to procure their assent to these statutes. This
was a very large, if not an unexampled concession:
and, together with many dangerous limitations, over∣threw
some useful barriers, which had been erected to
the constitution. But the tide was now running
strongly towards monarchy; and the Scots nation
plainly discovered, that their past resistence had pro∣ceeded
more from the turbulency of their aristocracy
and the bigotry of their ecclesiastics, than from any
fixed passion towards civil liberty. The Lords of ar∣ticles
were restored, with some exorbitant branches of
prerogative; and royal authority, fortified with more
plausible claims and pretences, was, in its full extent,
re-established in that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE prelacy likewise, by the abrogating every sta∣tute,
enacted in favour of presbytery, was thereby ta∣citely
restored; and the King deliberated what use he
should make of this concession. Lauderdale, who at
bottom was a passionate zealot against episcopacy, en∣deavoured
to perswade him, that the Scots, if gratified
in this favourite point of ecclesiastical government,
<PB N="375" REF="469"/>
would, in every other demand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXIII.</NOTE> be entirely compliant
with the King. Charles, though he had no such at∣tachment
to prelacy as had influenced his father and
grandfather, had suffered such indignities from the Scots
presbyterians, that he ever after bore them a most
hearty aversion. He said to Lauderdale, that presbyte∣rianism,
he thought, was not a religion for a gentle∣man;
and he could not consent to its farther continu∣ance
in Scotland. Middleton too and his other mini∣sters
persuaded him, that the nation in general were so
disgusted with the violence and tyranny of the ecclesi∣astics,
that any alteration of church government would
be universally grateful. And Clarendon, as well as
Ormond, dreading that the presbyterian sect, if legally
established in Scotland, would acquire authority in
England and Ireland, seconded the application of these
ministers. The resolution was therefore taken to re∣store
prelacy; a measure afterwards attended with many
and great inconveniencies: But whether in this resolu∣tion
the King did not chuse the less evil, it is very dif∣ficult
to determine. Sharpe, who had been commissioned
by the presbyterians in Scotland to manage their inte∣rest
with the King, was persuaded to abandon that
party; and as a reward for his compliance, was created
Archbishop of St. Andrew's. The management of ec∣clesiastical
affairs was chiefly intrusted to him; and as
he was deemed a traitor and a renegade by his old
friends, he became, on that account, as well as from
the violence of his conduct, extremely obnoxious to
them.</P>
<P>CHARLES had not promised to Scotland any such in∣demnity
as by his declaration of Breda he had ensured
to England: And it was deemed more political for him
to hold over men's heads, for some time, the terror of
punishment; till they should have made the requisite
compliance with the new established government. Tho'
<PB N="376" REF="470"/>
neither the King's temper nor plan of administration
led him to severity; some examples, after such a bloody
and triumphant rebellion, seemed necessary; and the
Marquess of Argyle and one Guthry, were pitched on
as the victims. Two acts of indemnity, one passed by
the late King in 1641, another by the present in 1651,
formed, it was thought, invincible obstacles to the pu∣nishment
of Argyle; and barred all enquiry into that
part of his conduct, which might justly be regarded as
the most exceptionable. Nothing remained but to try
him for his compliance with the usurpation; a crime
common to him with the whole nation, and such a one
as the most loyal and affectionate subject might fre∣quently
by violence be obliged to commit. To make
this compliance appear the more voluntary and hearty,
there were produced in court letters which he had
wrote to Albemarle, while that General governed Scot∣land,
and which contained expressions of the most cor∣dial
attachment. But besides the general indignation,
excited by Albemarle's discovery of this private corres∣pondence;
men thought, that even the highest demon∣strations
of affection might, during jealous times, be ex∣acted
as a necessary mark of compliance from a person
of such distinction as Argyle, and could not, by any
equitable construction, imply the crime of treason. The
parliament, however, was reduced to such a state of
servile complaisance as to pass sentence upon him: and
he died with great constancy and courage. As he was
universally known to have been the chief instrument of
past disorders and civil wars, the irregularity of his sen∣tence,
and several iniquitous circumstances in the me∣thod
of conducting his trial, seemed on that account to
admit of some apology. The Lord Lorne, son to
Argyle, having ever preserved his loyalty, obtained a
gift of the forfeiture. Guthry was a seditious preacher,
and had personally affronted the King: His punishment
<PB N="377" REF="471"/>
gave surprize to no body. Sir Archibald Johnstone of
Warriston was attainted and fled; but was seized in
France about two years after, brought over and exe∣cuted.
He had been very active, during all the late dis∣orders;
and was even suspected of a secret combination
with the English regicides.</P>
<P>BESIDES these instances of compliance in the Scots
parliament, they voted an additional revenue to the
King of 40,000 pounds a year, to be levied by way of
excise. A small force was proposed to be maintained by
this revenue, in order to prevent like confusions with
those to which the kingdom had been hitherto exposed.
An act was also passed, declaring the covenant to be
unlawful, and its obligation void and null. This was
a violent shock to the bigotted prejudices of the na∣tion.</P>
<P>IN England, the civil distinctions seemed to be abo∣lished
by the lenity and equality of Charles's administra∣tion.
Cavalier and round-head were heard of no more:
All men seemed to concur in submitting to the King's
lawful prerogatives, and in cherishing the just privileges
of the people and of parliament. Theological contro∣versy
alone still subsisted, and kept alive some sparks of
that flame, which had thrown the nation into such com∣bustion.
While catholics, independants, and other
sectaries were contented with entertaining some pro∣spect
of toleration; prelacy and presbytery struggled for
the superiority, and the hopes and fears of both parties
kept them in agitation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference at the Savoy, 25th of March.</NOTE> A conference was held in the
Savoy between twelve bishops and twelve leaders among
the presbyterian ministers, with an intention, or at least
on pretence, of bringing about an accommodation be∣tween
the parties. The surplice, the cross in baptism,
the kneeling at the sacrament, the bowing at the name
of Jesus, were anew canvassed; and the ignorant mul∣titude
were in hopes, that so many men of gravity and
<PB N="378" REF="472"/>
learning could not fail, after deliberate argumentation,
to agree in all points of controversy: They were sur∣prized
to see them separate more inflamed than ever,
and more confirmed in their several prejudices. To en∣ter
into particulars would be superfluous. Disputes con∣cerning
religious forms are often, in themselves, the
most frivolous of any; and merit attention only so far
as they have influence on the peace and order of civil
society.</P>
<P>THE King's declaration had promised that some en∣deavours
should be used to effect a comprehension of
both parties; and Charles's own indifference with re∣gard
to all such questions seemed a very favourable cir∣cumstance
for the execution of that project.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for and against a comprehen∣sion.</NOTE> The par∣tizans
of a comprehension said, that the presbyterians as
well as the prelatists, having felt by experience the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tal
effects of mutual obstinacy and violence, were now
well disposed towards an amicable agreement; that the
bishops, by relinquishing some part of their autho∣rity,
and dispensing with the most exceptionable cere∣monies,
would so gratify their adversaries as to obtain
their cordial and affectionate compliance, and unite the
whole nation in one faith and one worship; that by obsti∣nately
insisting on forms, in themselves insignificant, an
air of importance was bestowed on them, and men were
taught to continue equally obstinate in rejecting them; that
the presbyterian clergy would go every reasonable length,
rather than by parting with their livings, expose them∣selves
to a state of beggary, or at best of dependance;
and that if their pride were flattered by some seeming
alterations, and a pretence given them for affirming,
that they had not abandoned their former principles, no∣thing
farther was necessary to produce a thorough union
between those two parties, which comprehended the bulk
of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="473"/>
IT was alleged on the other hand, that the difference
between religious sects was founded, not on principle,
but on passion; and till the irregular affections of men
could be corrected, it was in vain to expect, by com∣pliances,
to obtain a perfect unanimity and comprehen∣sion;
that the more insignificant the objects of dispute
appeared, with the more certainty might it be inferred,
that the real ground of dissension was different from
that which was universally pretended, that the love of
novelty, the pride of argumentation, the pleasure of
making proselytes, and the obstinacy of contradiction,
would for ever give rise to sects and disputes, nor was it
possible that such a source of dissention could ever, by
any concessions, be entirely exhausted; that the church,
by departing from antient practices and principles,
would tacitly acknowlege herself guilty of error, and
lose that reverence, so requisite for preserving the at∣tachment
of the multitude; and that if the present con∣cessions
(which was more than probable) should prove
ineffectual, greater must still be made; and in the issue,
discipline would be despoiled of all its authority, and
worship of all its decency, without obtaining that end,
which had been so fondly sought for by these dangerous
indulgences.</P>
<P>THE ministry were inclined to give the preference to
the latter arguments; and were the more confirmed in
that intention by the disposition, which appeared in the
parliament lately assembled. The royalists and zealous
churchmen were at present the popular party in the na∣tion,
and, seconded by the efforts of the court, had
prevailed in almost every election. Not more than<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new par∣ment. 8th of May.</NOTE>
fifty-six members of the presbyterian party had obtained
seats in the lower house<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Carte's Answer to the Bystander, p. 79.</NOTE>; and these were able neither
to oppose nor retard the measures of the majority. Mo∣narchy,
therefore, and episcopacy, were now exalted
<PB N="380" REF="474"/>
to as great power and splendor as they had lately suffer∣ed
misery and depression. Sir Edward Turner was
chosen speaker.</P>
<P>AN act was passed for the security of the King's per∣son
and government. To intend or devise the King's
imprisonment, or bodily harm, or desposition, or the
levying war against him, is declared, during the life∣time
of his present Majesty, to be high treason. To
affirm him to be a papist or heretic, or to endeavour by
speech or writing to alienate his subjects affections from
him; these offences were made sufficient to incapacitate
the person guilty from holding any employment in church
or state. To maintain that the Long Parliament is not
dissolved, or that either or both Houses, without the
King, are possessed of legislative authority, or that the
covenant is binding; was made punishable by the pe∣nalty
of premunire.</P>
<P>THE covenant itself, together with the act for erect∣ing
the high court of justice, that for subscribing the
engagement, and that for declaring England a Com∣monwealth,
were ordered to be burned by the hands of
the hangman. The people assisted with great alacrity
on this occasion.</P>
<P>THE abuses of petitioning in the precedent reign had
been attended with the worst consequences; and to pre∣vent
such irregular practices for the future, it was en∣acted,
that no more than twenty hands should be sub∣scribed
to any petition, unless with the sanction of three
justices, or the major part of the grand jury; and that
no petition should be presented to the King or either
house by above ten persons. The penalty for a trans∣gression
of this law was a fine of a hundred pounds and
three months imprisonment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seats re∣stored.</NOTE> THE bishops, though restored to their spiritual autho∣rity,
were still excluded from parliament by the law,
<PB N="381" REF="475"/>
which the late King had passed, immediately before the
commencement of the civil disorders. Great violence,
both against the King and the House of Peers, had been
employed in passing this law; and on that account
alone, the partizans of the church were provided of a
very plausible pretence for repealing it. Charles ex∣pressed
much satisfaction, when he gave his assent to
the act for that purpose. It is certain, that the autho∣rity
of the crown, as well as that of the church, was
interested in restoring the prelates to their former dig∣nity.
But those who esteemed every acquisition of the
Prince a detriment to the people, were apt to complain
of this instance of complaisance in the parliament.</P>
<P>AFTER an adjournment of some months, the parlia∣ment
was again assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of No∣vember.</NOTE> and proceeded in the same
spirit as before. They discovered no design of restor∣ing,
in its full extent, the antient prerogatives of the
crown: They were only anxious to repair all those
breaches, which had been made, not by the love of li∣berty,
but by the fury of faction and civil war. The
power of the sword had, in all ages, been allowed to
be vested in the crown; and though no law conferred
this prerogative, every parliament, till the last of the
preceding reign, had willingly submitted to an autho∣rity
more antient, and therefore more sacred, than that
of any positive statute. It was now thought proper so∣lemnly
to relinquish the violent pretensions of that par∣liament,
and to acknowlege, that neither one house,
nor both houses, independant of the King, were pos∣sessed
of any military authority. The preamble to this
statute went so far as to renounce all right even of <HI>defen∣sive</HI>
arms against the King; and much observation has
been made with regard to a concession, esteemed so sin∣gular.
Were those terms taken in their full literal
sense, they imply a total renunciation of limitations to
monarchy, and of all privileges in the subject, indepen∣dant
<PB N="382" REF="476"/>
of the will of the Sovereign. For as no rights can
subsist without some remedy, much less rights exposed
to so much invasion from tyranny or even from ambi∣tion;
if subjects must never resist, it is certain, that
every Prince, without any effort, policy, or violence,
is at once rendered absolute and uncontroulable:
The Sovereign needs only issue an edict, abolishing
every authority but his own; and all liberty, from that
moment, is in effect annihilated. But this meaning it
were absurd to impute to the present parliament, who,
though zealous royalists, showed, in their measures,
that they had not cast off all regard to national privi∣leges.
They were probably sensible, that to suppose in
the Sovereign any such invasion of public liberty is en∣tirely
unconstitutional; and that therefore expressly to
reserve, upon that event, any right of resistance in the
subject must be liable to the same objection. They had
seen that the Long Parliament, under colour of defence,
had begun a violent attack upon kingly power; and
after involving the kingdom in blood, had finally lost
that liberty, for which they had so imprudently con∣tended.
They thought, though perhaps erroneously,
that it was no longer possible, after such exorbitant
pretensions, to persevere in that prudent silence, hitherto
maintained by the laws, and that it was necessary, by
some positive declaration, to bar the return of like in∣conveniences.
When they excluded, therefore, the
right of defence, they supposed, that, the constitution
remaining firm upon its basis, there never really could
be an attack made by the Sovereign. If such an attack
was at any time made, the necessity was then extreme:
And the case of extreme and violent necessity, no laws,
they thought, could comprehend; because to such a
necessity no laws could beforehand point out a proper
remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="477"/>
THE other measures of this parliament still discovered
a more anxious care to guard against rebellion in the
subjects than encroachments in the crown: The recent
evils of civil war and usurpation had naturally increased
the spirit of submission to the monarch, and had thrown
the nation into that dangerous extreme. During the
violent and jealous government of the parliament and of
the Protectors, all magistrates, liable to suspicion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corporation act.</NOTE> had
been expelled the corporations; and none had been
admitted, who gave not proofs of affection to the ruling
powers, or who refused to subscribe the covenant. To
leave all authority in such hands seemed dangerous; and
the parliament, therefore, empowered the King to ap∣point
commissioners for regulating the corporations,
and expelling such magistrates as either had intruded
themselves by violence, or professed principles, dange∣rous
to the constitution, civil and ecclesiastical. It was
also enacted, that all magistrates should disclaim the
obligation of the covenant, and should declare, both
their belief, that it was not lawful, upon any pretence
whatsoever, to take arms against the King, and their
abhorrence of the traiterous position of taking arms by
the King's authority against his person, or against those
commissioned by him.</P>
<P>WHEN the latter part of this oath, the words, <HI>com∣missioned
by him,</HI> which seem the most dangerous to the
constitution, came to be debated, it was moved in the
House, and earnestly pressed by Sir John Vaughan, an
eminent lawyer, that the word, <HI>lawfully,</HI> might be add∣ed,
in order to remove all difficulties. But the Attor∣ney-General,
Sir Heneage Finch, answered, that it
was not necessary: The very word, commission, im∣ported
it; since any power, not lawfully issued, to law∣ful
persons, and for a lawful purpose, was in reality no
commission: And the whole House seemed to assent to
this interpretation. The same word, <HI>lawfully,</HI> was en∣deavoured
<PB N="384" REF="478"/>
to be added by Southampton himself, in the
House of Peers; but a like answer was made by Angle∣sey.
Southampton still insisted, that such an addition
would clear all obscurities; and that many, not having
heard the particular sense of the parliament, might
fancy, that, if any sort of commission was granted, it
would not be lawful to resist it: But that worthy pa∣triot
could not prevail. The opinion of both parties,
it is to be presumed, was the same; Though the fear of
affording a pretence to rebellion made the royalists rashly
overlook the danger, to which liberty might be exposed
by such concessions. They thought, that in most hu∣man
deliberation, it was difficult, if not impossible, to
make a choice which was not exposed to some inconve∣nience.
And it is but too usual for victorious parties,
who had suffered under oppression, to signalize their
triumph over their adversaries, by carrying matters to
the extremity most opposite to that which had formerly
prevailed.</P>
<P>THE care of the church was no less prevalent with
this parliament than that of monarchy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1662.</NOTE> and the bill of
uniformity was a pledge of their sincere attachment to
the episcopal hierarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of uni∣formity.</NOTE> and of their antipathy to pres∣byterianism.
Different parties, however, concurred in
promoting this bill, which contained many severe
clauses. The independants and other sectaries, enraged
to find all their schemes subverted by the presbyterians,
who had once been their associates, exerted themselves
to disappoint that party of the favour and indulgence,
to which, from their recent merits in promoting the re∣storation,
they thought themselves justly entitled. By
the presbyterians, said they, the war was raised: By
them were the populace first incited to tumults: By
their zeal, interest, and riches were the armies sup∣ported:
By their force was the King subdued: And if,
<PB N="385" REF="479"/>
in the sequel, they protested against those extreme vio∣lences,
committed on his person by the military leaders,
their opposition came too late, after having supplied these
usurpers with the power and the pretences, by which
they maintained their sanguinary measures. They had
indeed concurred with the royalists in recalling the King:
But ought they to be esteemed, on that account, more
affectionate to the royal cause? Rage and animosity,
raised by disappointed ambition, were plainly their sole
motives; and if the King should now be so imprudent
as to distinguish them by any particular indulgences, he
would soon experience from them the same hatred and
opposition, which proved so fatal to his father.</P>
<P>THE catholics, though they had little interest in the
nation, were a considerable party at court; and from
their great services and sufferings, during the civil wars,
it seemed but just to bear them some favour and regard.
These religionists dreaded an entire union among the
protestants. Were they the sole nonconformists in the
nation, the severe execution of penal laws upon their
sect seemed an infallible consequence; and they used all
their interest to push matters to extremity against the
presbyterians, who had formerly been their most severe
oppressors, and whom they now expected for their com∣panions
in affliction. The Earl of Bristol, who, from
conviction, or interest, or levity, or complaisance for
the company with whom he lived, had changed his re∣ligion
during the King's exile, was regarded as the head
of this party.</P>
<P>THE church party had, during so many years, suf∣fered
such injuries and indignities from the sectaries of
every denomination, that no moderation, much less defe∣rence,
was on this occasion to be expected in their ec∣clesiastics.
Even the laity of that communion seemed
now disposed to retaliate upon their enemies, according
to the usual measures of party justice. This sect or
<PB N="386" REF="480"/>
faction (for it was a mixture of both) encouraged the
rumours of plots and conspiracies against the govern∣ment;
crimes, which, without any apparent cause,
they imputed to their adversaries. And instead of en∣larging
their terms of communion, in order to compre∣hend
the presbyterians, they gladly laid hold of the pre∣judices,
which prevailed among that sect, in order to
eject them from all their livings. By the bill of uni∣formity
it was required, that every clergyman should be
re-ordained, if he had not before received episcopal or∣dination;
should declare his assent to every thing con∣tained
in the Book of Common Prayer; should take
the oath of canonical obedience; should abjure the so∣lemn
league and covenant, and should renounce the
principle of taking arms, on any pretence whatsoever,
against the King.</P>
<P>THIS bill re-instated the church in the same condi∣tion,
in which it stood before the commencement of the
civil wars; and as the old persecuting laws of Elizabeth
still subsisted in their full rigor, and new clauses of a
like nature were now enacted, all the King's promises
of toleration and of indulgence to tender consciences
were thereby eluded and broken. 'Tis true, Charles,
in his declaration from Breda, had expressed his inten∣tion
of regulating that indulgence by the advice and au∣thority
of parliament: But this limitation could never
reasonably be extended to a total infringement and vio∣lation
of his promise. It is agreed, that the King did
not voluntarily concur with this violent measure, and
that the zeal of Clarendon and of the church party among
the Commons, seconded by the intrigues of the catholics,
was the real cause, which extorted his consent.</P>
<P>THE royalists, who now predominated, were very
ready to signalize their victory, by establishing those
high principles of monarchy, which their antagonists
had controverted: But when any real power or revenue
<PB N="387" REF="481"/>
was demanded for the crown, they were neither so for∣ward
nor so liberal in their concessions as the King
would gladly have wished. Though the parliament
passed laws for regulating the navy, they took no no∣tice
of the army; and declined giving their sanction to
this dangerous innovation. The King's debts were be∣come
intolerable; and the Commons were at last con∣strained
to vote him an extraordinary supply of 1,200,000
pounds, to be levied by eighteen months assessment.
But besides that this supply was much inferior to the oc∣casion,
the King was obliged earnestly to sollicit the
Commons, before he could obtain it; and, in order to
convince the House of its absolute necessity, he desired
them to examine strictly into all his receipts and dis∣bursements.
Finding likewise upon enquiry, that the
several branches of revenue fell much short of the sums
expected, they at last, after much delay, voted a new
imposition of two shillings on each hearth; and this tax
they settled on the King during life. The whole esta∣blished
revenue, however, did not, for many years,
exceed a million<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">D'Egrades, 25th of July, 1761. Mr. Ralph's History, vol. i. p. 176.</NOTE>; a sum confessedly too narrow for the
public expences. A very rigid frugality at least, which
the King wanted, would have been requisite to make it
suffice for the dignity and security of the government.
After all business was dispatched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of May</NOTE> the parliament was
prorogued.</P>
<P>BEFORE the parliament rose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's mar∣riage.</NOTE> the court was employed
in making preparations for the reception of the new
Queen, Catherine of Portugal, to whom the King was
betrothed, and who had just landed at Portsmouth. Dur∣ing
the time, that the Protector carried on the war with
Spain, he was naturally led to support the Portuguese in
their revolt; and he engaged himself by treaty to supply
them with 10,000 men for their defence against the
Spaniards. On the King's restoration, advances were
<PB N="388" REF="482"/>
made by Portugal for the renewal of that alliance; and
in order to bind the friendship closer, an offer was
made of the Portuguese Princess, and a portion of
300,000 pounds, together with two fortresses, Tangiers
in Africa and Bombay in the East Indies. Spain, who,
after the peace of the Pyrenees, bent all her force to re∣cover
Portugal, now in appearance abandoned by
France, took the alarm, and endeavoured to fix Charles
in an opposite interest. The Catholick King offered to
adopt any other Princess as a daughter of Spain, either
the Princess of Parma, or, what he thought more po∣pular,
some Protestant Princess, the daughter of Den∣mark,
Saxony, or Orange: And on any of these, he
promised to confer a dowry equal to that offered by Por∣tugal.
But many reasons inclined Charles rather to ac∣cept
of the Portuguese proposals. The great disorders
in the government and finances of Spain, made the
execution of her promises be much doubted; and the
King's urgent wants demanded some supply of money.
The interest of the English commerce likewise seemed
to require, that the independancy of Portugal should be
supported, lest the union of that crown with Spain
should put the whole treasures of America into the
hands of one potentate. The claims too of Spain upon
Dunkirk and Jamaica, rendered it impossible, without
farther concessions, to obtain the cordial friendship of
that power: And on the other hand, the offer, made
by Portugal, of two such considerable fortresses, pro∣mised
a great accession to the naval force of England.
Above all, the proposal of a Protestant Princess, was
no allurement to Charles, whose inclinations led him
strongly to give the preference to a Catholic alliance.
According to the most probable accounts<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 254. This account seems better supported, than that in Ablancourt's Memoirs, that the Chancellor chiefly pushed the Portuguese alliance. The secret transactions of the court of England could not be supposed to be much known to a French resident at Lisbon: And whatever opposition the Chancellor made, he would certainly endeavour to conceal it from the Queen and all her family; and even in the parliament and council would support the resolution already taken.</NOTE>, the resolu∣tion
<PB N="389" REF="483"/>
of marrying the daughter of Portugal was taken by
the King, unknown to all his ministers; and no re∣monstrances
could prevail with him to alter his inten∣tions.
The Chancellor, with Ormond and Southamp∣ton,
urged many opposite reasons; and particularly in∣sisted
on a report, which was current, of the incapacity
of the Princess to have children: But their arguments
were rejected. When the matter was laid before the
council, all voices concurred in approving the resolu∣tion;
and the parliament expressed the same complais∣ance.
And thus was concluded, seemingly with uni∣versal
consent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21th of May</NOTE> the inauspicious marriage with Cathe∣rine,
a Princess of virtue, but who was never able,
either by the graces of her person or humour, to make
herself agreeable to the King. The report however of
her natural incapacity to have children, seems to have
been groundless; since she was twice declared to be
pregnant<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lord Lansdown's Defence of General Monk. Temple, vol. ii. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE festivity of these espousals was clouded by the
trial and execution of criminals. Berkstead, Cobbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
and Okey, three regicides, had escaped beyond sea;
and after wandering some time concealed in Germany,
came privately to Delft, having appointed their families
to meet them in that place. They were discovered by
Downing, the King's resident in Holland, who had
formerly served the Protector and Commonwealth in the
same station, and who once had even been Chaplain to
Okey's regiment. He applied to the States for a war∣rant
to arrest them. It had been usual for the States to
grant these warrants; though at the same time, they
had ever been careful secretly to advertise the persons,
<PB N="390" REF="484"/>
that they might be enabled to make their escape. This
precaution was eluded by the vigilance and dispatch of
Downing. He quickly seized the criminals, hurried
them on board a frigate which lay off the coast, and
sent them to England. These three men behaved with
more moderation and submission than any of the other
regicides, who had suffered. Okey in particular, at
the place of execution, prayed for the King, and ex∣pressed
his intention, had he lived, of submitting peace∣ably
to the established government. He had risen dur∣ing
the wars from being a chandler in London to a high
rank in the army; and in all his conduct appeared to be
of a man humanity and honour. In consideration of his
good character and of his dutiful behaviour, his body
was given his friends to be buried.</P>
<P>THE attention of the public was much engaged by
the trial of two distinguished criminals, Lambert and
Vane. These men, though none of the immediate
murderers of the King, had been excepted from the ge∣neral
indemnity, and committed to prison. The Con∣vention-Parliament,
however, was so favourable to
them, as to petition the King, if they should be found
guilty, to suspend their execution: But this new
parliament, more zealous for monarchy, applied for
their trial and condemnation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Vane.</NOTE> Not to revive disputes,
which were better buried in oblivion, the indictment of
Vane did not comprehend any of his actions during the
war between the King and parliament: It extended
only to his behaviour after the late King's death, as
member of the Council of State, and Secretary of the
Navy; where fidelity to the trust reposed in him, re∣quired
his opposition to monarchy.</P>
<P>VANE wanted neither courage nor capacity to avail
himself of this advantage. He urged, that, if a com∣pliance
with the government, at that time established in
<PB N="391" REF="485"/>
England, and an acknowledgment of its authority were
to be regarded as criminal, the whole nation had incur∣red
equal guilt, and none would remain, whose inno∣cence
could entitle them to try or condemn him for his
pretended treasons: That, according to these maxims,
wherever an illegal authority was established by force, a
total and universal destruction must ensue; while the
usurpers proscribed one part of the nation for disobe∣dience,
the lawful Prince punished the other for com∣pliance:
That the legislature of England, foreseeing
this violent situation, had provided for public security
by the famous statute of Henry the seventh; in which
it was enacted, that no man, in case of any revolution,
should ever be questioned for his obedience to the King
in being: That whether the established government
was a Monarchy or a Commonwealth, the reason of
the thing was still the same; nor ought the expelled
Prince to think himself entitled to allegiance, so long
as he could not afford protection: That it belonged not
to private persons, possessed of no power, to discuss the
title of their governors; and every usurpation, even the
most flagrant, would equally require obedience with
the most legal establishment: That the controversy be∣tween
the late King and his parliament was of the most
delicate nature; and men of the greatest probity had been
divided in their choice of the party which they should
embrace: That the parliament, being rendered undis∣soluble
but by their own consent, was become a kind
of co-ordinate power with the King; and as the case
was thus entirely new and unknown to the constitution,
it ought not to be tried rigidly by the letter of the an∣tient
laws: That for his part, all the violences, which
had been put upon the parliament, and upon the person
of the Sovereign, he had ever condemned; nor had he
once appeared in the House for some time before and
after the execution of the King: That, finding the
<PB N="392" REF="486"/>
whole government thrown into disorder, he was still re∣solved,
in every revolution, to adhere to the Com∣mons,
the root, the foundation of all lawful autho∣rity:
That in prosecution of this principle, he had
cheerfully undergone all the violence of Cromwel's ty∣ranny;
and would now, with equal alacrity, expose
himself to the rigours of perverted law and justice:
That though it was in his power, on the King's resto∣ration,
to have escaped from his enemies, he was deter∣mined,
in imitation of the most illustrious names of an∣tiquity,
to perish in defence of liberty, and to give tes∣timony
with his blood for that honourable cause, in
which he had been inlisted: And that, besides the ties,
with which God and nature had bound him to his na∣tive
country, he was voluntarily engaged by the most
sacred covenant, whose obligation no earthly power
should ever be able to make him relinquish.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of June</NOTE> ALL the defence, which Vane could make, was fruit∣less.
The court, considering more the general opinion
of his active guilt in the beginning and prosecution of
the civil wars, than the articles of treason charged
against him, took advantage of the letter of the law,
and brought him in guilty. His courage deserted him
not upon his condemnation. Though timid by nature,
the persuasion of a just cause supported him against
the terrors of death; while his enthusiasm, excited by
the prospect of glory, embellished the conclusion of a
life, which, through the whole course of it, had been
so much disfigured by the prevalence of that principle.
Lest pity for a courageous sufferer should make impres∣sion
on the populace, drummers were placed under the
scaffold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu∣tion. 14th of June</NOTE> whose noise, as he began to launch out in
reflections on the government, drowned his voice, and
admonished him to temper the ardour of his zeal. He
was not astonished at this unexpected incident. In all
his behaviour, there appeared a firm and animated in∣trepidity;
<PB N="393" REF="487"/>
and he considered death but as as a passage
to that eternal felicity, which he believed to be pre∣pared
for him.</P>
<P>THIS man, so celebrated for his parliamentary ta∣lents,
and for his capacity in business, has left some
writings behind him: They treat all of them, of reli∣gious
subjects, and are absolutely unintelligible: No
traces of eloquence, or even of common sense appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in them. A strange paradox! did we not know, that
men of the greatest genius, where they relinquish by
principle the use of their reason, are only enabled by
their vigour of mind, to work themselves the deeper
into error and absurdity. It was remarked, that, as
Vane, by being the chief instrument of Strafford's death,
had first opened the way for that destruction, which
overwhelmed the nation; so by his own death he closed
the scene of blood. He was the last that suffered on ac∣count
of the civil wars. Lambert, though condemned,
was reprieved at the bar; and the judges declared, that,
if Vane's behaviour had been equally dutiful and sub∣missive,
he would have experienced like lenity in the
King. Lambert survived his condemnation near thirty
years. He was confined to the isle of Guernesey;
where he lived contented, forgetting all his past schemes
of greatness, and entirely forgot by the nation.</P>
<P>HOWEVER odious Vane and Lambert to the presby∣terians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presbyteria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> clergy eject∣ed. 24th of Au∣gust.</NOTE>
that party had no leisure to rejoice at their con∣demnation.
The fatal St. Bartholomew approached;
the day, when the clergy were obliged by the late law,
either to relinquish their livings, or to sign the articles
required of them. A combination had been entered
into by the more zealous of the presbyterian ecclesias∣tics
to refuse the subscription; in hopes, that the
bishops would not dare at once to expel so great a num∣ber
of the most popular preachers. The catholic party
at court, who desired a great rent among the protes∣tants,
<PB N="394" REF="488"/>
encouraged them in this obstinacy, and gave them
hopes, that the King would protect them in their refu∣sal.
The King himself, by his irresolute conduct, con∣tributed,
either from design or accident, to increase this
opinion. Above all, the terms of subscription had been
made very strict and rigid, on purpose to disgust all the
zealous and scrupulous among the presbyterians, and
deprive them of their livings. About 2000 of the clergy,
in one day, relinquished their cures; and to the great
astonishment of the court, sacrificed their interest to their
religious tenets. Fortified by society in their sufferings,
they were resolved to undergo any hardships, rather
than openly renounce those principles, which, on other
occasions, they were so apt, from interest, to warp or
elude. The church enjoyed the pleasure of retaliation;
and even pushed, as usual, the vengeance farther than
the offence. During the dominion of the parliamentary
party, a fifth of the livings had been left to the ejected
clergy; but this indulgence, though at first insisted on
by the House of Peers, was now refused to the presby∣terians.
However difficult to conciliate peace among
theologicians, it was hoped by many that some relaxa∣tion
in the terms of communion might have kept the
presbyterians united to the church, and have cured those
ecclesiastical factions, which had been so fatal, and
were still so dangerous. Bishoprics were offered to
Calamy, Baxter and Reynolds, great leaders among the
presbyterians; the last only could be prevailed with to
accept. Deaneries and other promotions were refused by
many.</P>
<P>THE next measure of the King has not had the
good fortune to be justified by any party; but is often
considered as one of the greatest mistakes, if not ble∣mishes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunkirk sold to the French.</NOTE>
of his reign: 'Tis the sale of Dunkirk to the
French. The parsimonious maxims of the parliament,
and the liberal, not to say lavish, disposition of the
<PB N="395" REF="489"/>
King, were but ill suited to each other; and notwith∣standing
all the supplies voted him, his treasury was
still very empty and very much indebted. He had re∣ceived
the sum of 200,000 crowns from France; but
the forces sent over to Portugal, and the fleets, main∣tained
in order to defend that kingdom, had already
cost the King that sum, and together with it, above
double the money, which he had received for the
Queen's dowry<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Estrade, 17th of August, 1662.</NOTE>. The time fixed for payment of his
sister's portion to the Duke of Orleans was now ap∣proaching.
Tangiers, a fortress from which great be∣nefit
was expected, was become an additional burthen
on the crown; and Rutherford, who now commanded
in Dunkirk, had increased the charge of that garrison
to a hundred and twenty thousand pounds a year. These
considerations had such influence, not only on the
King, but even on Clarendon, that that uncorrupt mi∣nister
was the most forward to advise the accepting a
sum of money in lieu of a place which, he thought, the
King, from the narrow state of his revenue, was no
longer able to retain. By the treaty with Portugal, it
was stipulated, that Dunkirk should never be yielded to
the Spaniards: France was therefore the only purchaser
that remained. D'Estrades was invited over by a letter
from the Chancellor himself, in order to conclude the
bargain. Nine hundred thousand pounds were demand∣ed:
One hundred thousand were offered. The English
by degrees lowered their demands: The French raised
their offer: And the bargain was struck at 400,000
pounds. The artillery and stores were valued at a fifth
of the sum<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Id. 21st of August. 12th of September, 1662.</NOTE>. The importance of this sale was not,
at that time, sufficiently known, either abroad or at
home<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">It appears, however, from many of D'Estrade's letters, particularly that of the 21st of August, 1661, that the King might have transferred Dunkirk to the parliament, who would not have refused to bear the charges of it, but were unwilling to give money to the King for that purpose. The King on the other hand was jealous, lest the parliament should acquire any such sepa∣rate dominion or authority: A proof that the government was not as yet settled into that composure, and mutual confidence, which is absolutely re∣quisite for conducting it.</NOTE>.

and this sum, in appearance so small, was the utmost,
which he would allow his Ambassador to offer.</P>
<P>A NEW incident discovered such a glimpse of the
King's character and principles of policy as at first the
nation was somewhat at a loss how to interpret, but
such as subsequent events, by degrees, rendered suffi∣ciently
plain and manifest.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of indul∣gence. 26th of De∣cember.</NOTE> He issued a declaration on
pretence of mitigating the rigours, contained in the act
of uniformity. After expressing his firm resolution to
observe the general indemnity, and to trust entirely to
the affections of his subjects, not to any military power,
for the support of his throne; he mentioned the pro∣mises
of liberty of conscience, contained in his decla∣ration
of Breda. And he subjoined, that, “as in the
first place he had been zealous to settle the unifor∣mity
of the church of England, in discipline, cere∣mony
and government, and shall ever constantly
maintain it: So as for what concerns the penalties
upon those who, living peaceably, do not conform
themselves thereunto, through scruple and tenderness
of misguided conscience, but modestly and without
scandal perform their devotions in their own way, he
should make it his special care, so far as in him lay,
<PB N="397" REF="491"/>
without invading the freedom of parliament, to in∣cline
their wisdom next approaching sessions to con∣cur
with him in making some such act for that pur∣pose,
as may enable him to exercise, with a more
universal satisfaction, that power of dispensing, which
he conceived to be inherent in him<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Kennet's Register, p. 850.</NOTE>.” Here a most
important prerogative was exercised by the King; but
under such artificial reserves and limitations as might
prevent the full discussion of the claim, and obviate a
breach between him and his parliament. The founda∣tion
of this measure lay much deeper, and was of the
utmost consequence.</P>
<P>THE King, during his exile, had imbibed strong pre∣judices
in favour of the catholic religion; and accord∣ing
to the most probable accounts, had already been re∣conciled
in form to the church of Rome. The great
zeal, expressed by the parliamentary party against all
papists, had always, from a spirit of opposition, inclin∣ed
the court and all the royalists to adopt more favour∣able
sentiments towards that sect, who, through the
whole course of the civil wars, had strenuously sup∣ported
the rights of the Sovereign. The rigour too,
which the King, during his abode in Scotland, had ex∣perienced
from the presbyterians, disposed him to run into
the other extreme, and to bear a kindness to the party,
most opposite in its genius to the severity of those reli∣gionists.
The sollicitations and importunities of the
Queen-mother, the contagion of the company which
he frequented, the view of a more splendid and courtly
mode of worship, the hopes of indulgence in pleasure;
all these causes operated powerfully on a young Prince,
whose careless and dissolute temper made him incapable
of adhering closely to the principles of his early educa∣tion.
But if the thoughtless humour of Charles ren∣dered
him an easy convert to popery, the same disposi∣tion
<PB N="398" REF="492"/>
ever prevented the theological tenets of that sect
from taking any fast hold of him. During his vigorous
state of health, while his blood was warm and his spi∣rits
high, a contempt and disregard of all religion held
possession of his mind; and he might more properly be
denominated a deist than a catholic. But in those revo∣lutions
of temper, when the love of raillery gave place
to reflection, and his penetrating, but negligent under∣standing
was clouded with fears and apprehensions, he
had starts of more sincere conviction, and a sect, which
always possessed his inclinations, was then master of his
judgment and opinion.</P>
<P>BUT though the King thus floated, during his whole
reign, between irreligion, which he more openly pro∣fessed,
and popery, to which he retained a secret pro∣pensity,
his brother, the Duke of York, had zealously
adopted all the principles of that theological party. His
eager temper and narrow understanding made him a
thorough convert, without any reserve from interest, or
doubts from reasoning and enquiry. By his application
to business, he had acquired a great ascendant over the
King, who, though possessed of much more discern∣ment,
was glad to throw the burthen of affairs on the
Duke, of whom he entertained little jealousy. On
pretence of easing the protestant dissenters, they agreed
upon a plan for introducing a general toleration, and
giving the catholics the free exercise of their religion;
at least, the exercise of it in private houses. The two
brothers saw with pleasure so numerous and popular a
body of the clergy refuse conformity; and it was hoped,
that, under shelter of their name, the small and hated
sect of the catholics might meet with favour and pro∣tection.</P>
<P>BUT while the King pleaded his early promises of
toleration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1663. 18th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> and insisted on many other plausible topics,
<PB N="399" REF="493"/>
the parliament, who sat a little after the declaration
was issued, could by no means be satisfied with this
measure. The declared intention of easing the dissen∣ters,
and the secret purpose of favouring the catholics,
were equally disagreeable to them; and in these prepos∣sions
they were encouraged by the King's ministers
themselves, particularly the Chancellor. The House of
Commons represented to the King, that his declaration
of Breda contained no promise to the presbyterians and
other dissenters, but only an expression of his intentions,
upon the supposition of the parliament's concurrence;
that even if the nonconformists had been entitled to
plead a promise, they had entrusted this claim as well
as all their other rights and privileges, to the House of
Commons, who were their representatives, and who
now freed the King from that obligation; that it was
not to be supposed, that his Majesty and the Houses were
so bound by that declaration as to be incapacitated from
making any laws, which might be contrary to it; that
even at the King's restoration, there were laws of uni∣formity
in force, which could not be dispensed with but
by act of parliament; and that the indulgence proposed
would prove most pernicious both to church and state,
would open the door to schism, encourage faction, di∣sturb
the public peace, and discredit the wisdom of the
legislature. The King did not think proper, after this
remonstrance, to insist any farther at present on the pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ect
of indulgence.</P>
<P>IN order to deprive the catholics of all hopes, the
two Houses concurred in a remonstrance against them.
The King gave a very gracious answer; though he
scrupled not to profess his gratitude towards many of
that persuasion, on account of their faithful services in
his father's cause and in his own. A proclamation, for
form's sake, was soon after issued against Jesuits and
Romish priests: But care was taken, by the very terms
<PB N="400" REF="494"/>
of it, to render it ineffectual. The parliament had al∣lowed,
that all the foreign priests, belonging to the two
Queens, should be excepted, and that a permission for
them to remain in England should still be granted. In
the proclamation, the word <HI>foreign,</HI> was purposely
omitted; and the Queens were thereby authorized to
give protection to as many English priests as they should
think proper.</P>
<P>THAT the King might reap some advantage from his
compliances, however fallacious, he engaged the Commons
anew into an examination of his revenue, which, chiefly
by the negligence in levying it, had proved, he said,
much inferior to the public charges. Notwithstanding
the price of Dunkirk, his debts, he complained, amount∣ed
to a considerable sum; and to satisfy the Commons,
that the money formerly granted him, had not been pro∣digally
expended, he offered to lay before them the
whole account of his disbursements. It is however
agreed on all hands, that the King, though during his
banishment, he had managed his small and precarious
income with great order and oeconomy, had now much
abated of these virtues, and was unable to make his
royal revenues suffice for his expences. The Commons,
without entering into too nice a disquisition, voted him
four subsidies; and this was the last time, that taxes
were levied in that manner.</P>
<P>SEVERAL laws were made this session with regard to
trade. The militia also came under consideration, and
some rules were established for ordering and arming it.
It was enacted, that the King should have no power of
keeping the militia under arms above fourteen days in
the year. The situation of this island, together with
its great naval power, has always occasioned other
means of security, however requisite, to be much neg∣lected
amongst us: And the parliament showed here a
very superfluous jealousy of the King's strictness in dis∣ciplining
<PB N="401" REF="495"/>
the militia. The principles of liberty rather
require a contrary jealousy.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Bristol's friendship with Clarendon,
which had subsisted, with great intimacy, during their
exile and the distresses of the royal party, had been
considerably impaired since the restoration, by the Chan∣cellor's
refusal of his assent to some grants, which
Bristol had applied for to a court lady: And a little
after, the latter nobleman, agreeable to the impetuosity
and indiscretion of his temper, broke out against the
minister in the most outrageous manner. He even en∣tered
a charge of treason against him before the House
of Peers; but had concerted his plan so imprudently,
that the judges, when consulted, declared, that, neither
for its matter nor its form, could it legally be received.
The articles indeed resemble more the incoherent alter∣cations
of a passionate enemy, than a serious charge, fit
to be discussed by a court of judicature; and Bristol
himself was so ashamed of his conduct and defeat, that
he absconded during some time. Notwithstanding his
fine talents, his eloquence, his spirit, and his courage,
he could never regain the character, which he lost by
this hasty and precipitant measure.</P>
<P>BUT though Clarendon was able to clude this rash
assault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decline o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clarendon's credit.</NOTE> he was sensibly declining in his credit at court;
and in proportion as the King found himself established
on the throne, he began to alienate himself from a mi∣nister
whose character was so little suited to his own.
The King's favour for the catholics was always opposed
by Clarendon, public liberty was secured against all at∣tempts
of the over-zealous royalists, prodigal grants
were checked or refused, and the dignity of his own
character was so much consulted by the Chancellor,
that he made it an inviolable rule, as did also his friend,
Southampton, never to enter into any connexion with
the royal mistresses. The King's favourite was Mrs.
<PB N="402" REF="496"/>
Palmer, afterwards created Dutchess of Cleveland; a
woman prodigal, rapacious, dissolute, violent, revenge∣ful.
She failed not in her turn to undermine Claren∣don's
credit with his master; and her success was at
this time made apparent to the whole world. Secretary
Nicholas, the Chancellor's great friend, was removed
from his place; and Sir Harry Bennet, his avowed
enemy, was advanced to that office. Bennet was soon
after created Lord Arlington.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King's conduct had hitherto, since his
restoration, been, in the main, laudable, men of pene∣tration
began to observe, that those virtues, by which
he had, at first, so much dazzled and enchanted the
nation, had great show, but not equal solidity.
His good understanding lost much of its influence by
his want of application; his bounty was more the
result of a facility of disposition than of any gene∣rosity
of character; his social humour led him frequent∣ly
to neglect his dignity; his love of pleasure was not
attended with proper sentiment and decency; and while
he seemed to bear a good will to every one that ap∣proached
him, he had a heart not very capable of sin∣cere
friendship, and he had secretly entertained a very
bad opinion and dirstust of mankind. But above all,
what sullied his character in the eyes of good judges
was his negligent ingratitude towards the unfortunate
cavaliers, whose zeal and sufferings for the royal cause
had known no bounds. This conduct however in the
King may, from the circumstances of his situation and
temper, admit of some excuse; at least, of some alle∣viation.
As he had been restored more by the efforts
of his reconciled enemies than of his antient friends,
the former pretended a title to share his favour; and
being from practice, acquainted with public business,
they were better qualified to execute any trust commit∣ted
to them. The King's revenues were far from being
<PB N="403" REF="497"/>
large, or even equal to his necessary expences; and
his mistresses, and the companions of his mirth and plea∣sures,
gained by sollicitation every request from his
easy temper. The very poverty, to which the more
zealous royalists had reduced themselves, by rendering
them insignificant, made them unfit to support the
King's measures, and caused him to regard them as a
useless incumbrance. And as many false and ridicu∣lous
claims of merit were offered, his natural indolence,
averse to a strict discussion or enquiry, led him to treat
them all with equal indifference. The parliament took
some notice of the poor cavaliers. Sixty thousand
pounds were at one time distributed among them: Mrs.
Lane also and the Penderells had handsome presents and
pensions from the King. But the greatest part of the
royalists still remained in poverty and distress; aggra∣vated
by the cruel disappointment of their sanguine
hopes, and by seeing favour and preferment bestowed
upon their most inveterate foes. With regard to the
act of indemnity and oblivion, they universally said,
that it was an act of indemnity to the King's enemies,
and of oblivion to his friends.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXIV.</NOTE> THE next sessions of parliament discovered a con∣tinuance
of the same principles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1664.</NOTE> which had ac∣tuated all the foregoing. Monarchy and the church
were still the objects of tender affection.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of March. A new ses∣sion.</NOTE> During no
period of the present reign, did this spirit pass more
evidently the bounds of reason and moderation.</P>
<P>THE King in his speech to the parliament had ven∣tured
openly to demand a repeal of the triennial act; and
he even went so far as to declare, that, notwithstanding
the law, he never would allow any parliament to be
assembled by the methods prescribed in that famous sta∣tute.
The parliament, without taking offence at this
declaration, repealed the law; and in lieu of all the se∣curities,
formerly provided, satisfied themselves with a
general clause, “that parliaments should not be in∣terrupted
above three years at the most.” As the
English parliament had now raised itself to be a regular
<PB N="405" REF="499"/>
check and controul upon royal power; 'tis evident, that
they ought still to have preserved a regular security for
their meeting, and not have trusted entirely to the good∣will
of the King, who, if ambitious or enterprising, had
so little reason to be pleased with these assemblies. Be∣fore
the end of Charles's reign, the nation had occa∣sion
to feel very sensibly the bad effects of this repeal.</P>
<P>BY the act of uniformity, every clergyman, who
should officiate without being properly qualified, was
punishable by fines and imprisonment: But this security
was not thought sufficient for the church. It was now
enacted, that, wherever five persons above those of the
same household, should assemble in a religious congre∣gation,
every one of them was liable, for the first of∣fence,
to be imprisoned three months, or pay five
pounds; for the second, to be imprisoned six months,
or pay ten pounds; and for the third, to be transported
seven years, or pay one hundred pounds. The parlia∣ment
had only in their eye the malignity of the secta∣ries:
They should have carried their attention farther,
to the cause of that malignity, the former restraint and
hardships, which they had undergone.</P>
<P>THE Commons likewise passed a vote, that the
wrongs, dishonours, and indignities, offered to the
English by the subjects of the United Provinces, were
the greatest obstructions to all foreign trade: And they
promised to assist the King with their lives and fortunes
in asserting the rights of his crown against all opposi∣tion
whatsoever. This was the first open step towards
a Dutch war. We must explain the causes and mo∣tives
of this measure.</P>
<P>THAT close union and confederacy, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with Hol∣land.</NOTE> during a
course of near seventy years, has subsisted, without in∣terruption
or jealousy, between England and Holland,
is not so much founded on the natural unalterable
<PB N="406" REF="500"/>
interests of these states, as on their terror of the grow∣ing
power of France, who, without their combination
it is apprehended would soon extend her dominion over
Europe. In the first years of Charles's reign, when
the ambitious genius of the French monarch had not,
as yet, displayed itself; and when the mighty force of
his people was, in a great measure, unknown even to
themselves, the rivalship of commerce, not checked by
any other jealousy or apprehension, had naturally in
England begot a violent enmity against the neighbour∣ing
republic.</P>
<P>TRADE was beginning, among the English, to be a
matter of very general concern; but notwithstanding
all their efforts and advantages, their commerce seemed
hitherto to stand upon a footing, which was somewhat
precarious. The Dutch, who, by industry and fruga∣lity,
were enabled to undersell them in every market,
retained possession of the most lucrative branches of
commerce; and the English merchants had the morti∣fication
to find, that all attempts to extend their trade
were still turned, by the vigilance of their rivals, to
their loss and dishonour. Their indignation increased,
when they considered the superior naval power of Eng∣land,
the bravery of her officers and seamen, her fa∣vourable
situation by which she was enabled to inter∣cept
the whole Dutch commerce. By the prospect of
these advantages, they were strongly prompted from mo∣tives
less just than political, to make war upon the
States; and at once to ravish from them by force, what
they could not obtain, or could obtain but slowly, by
superior skill and industry.</P>
<P>THE careless, unambitious temper of Charles ren∣dered
him little capable of forming so vast a project as
that of engrosing the commerce and naval power of
Europe; yet could he not remain altogether insensible
<PB N="407" REF="501"/>
to such obvious and such tempting prospects. His ge∣nius,
happily turned towards mechanics, inclined him
to study naval affairs, which, next to pleasure, he both
loved the most of all things, and understood the best.
Though the Dutch, during his exile, had expressed to∣wards
him more civility and friendship, than he had re∣ceived
from any other foreign power; the Louvestein
or aristocratic faction, which, at this time, ruled the
Commonwealth, had fallen into close union with
France; and could that party be subdued, he might
hope, that his nephew, the young Prince of Orange,
would be re-instated in the authority, possessed by his
ancestors, and would bring the States to a dependance
under England. His narrow revenues made it still re∣quisite
for him to study the humour of his people,
which now ran violently towards war; and it has been
suspected, though the suspicion was not justified by the
event, that the hopes of diverting some of the supplies
to his private use were not overlooked by this necessitous
monarch.</P>
<P>THE Duke of York, more active and enterprising,
pushed more eagerly the war with Holland. He desired
an opportunity of distinguishing himself: He loved to
cultivate commerce: He was at the head of a new Afri∣can
company, whose trade was extremely checked by
the settlements of the Dutch: And perhaps, the bigot∣ted
prejudices, by which that Prince was always so
much governed, began, even so early, to instil into
him an antipathy against a protestant Commonwealth,
the bulwark of the reformation. Clarendon and South∣ampton,
observing that the nation was not fortified by
any foreign alliance, were averse to the war; but their
credit was now on the decline.</P>
<P>BY these concurring motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of May</NOTE> the court and parlia∣ment
were both of them inclined to a Dutch war. The
parliament was prorogued without voting any supplies:
<PB N="408" REF="502"/>
But as they had been induced, without any open appli∣cation
from the crown, to pass that vote above-men∣tioned
against the Dutch encroachments, it was rea∣sonably
considered as sanction sufficient for the vigo∣rous
measures, which were resolved on.</P>
<P>DOWNING, the English minister at the Hague, a man
of an insolent, impetuous temper, presented a memorial
to the States, containing a list of those depredations,
which the English complained of. It is remarkable, that
all the pretended depredations preceded the year 1662,
when a treaty of league and alliances had been renewed
with the Dutch; and these complaints where then
thought, either so unjust or so frivolous, that they had
not been mentioned in that treaty. Two ships alone,
the Bonaventure and the Good-hope, had been claimed
by the English; and it was agreed, that they should
prosecute their claim by the ordinary course of justice.
The States had consigned a sum of money, in case the
cause should be decided against them; but the matter
was still in dependance. Cary, who was entrusted by
the proprietors with the management of the lawsuit for
the Bonaventure, had resolved to accept of thirty thou∣sand
pounds, which were offered him; but was hindered
by Downing, who told him, that the claim was a mat∣ter
of state between the two nations, not a concern of
private persons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. ii. p. 42.</NOTE>. These
circumstances give us no fa∣vourable
idea of the justice of the English pretensions.</P>
<P>CHARLES confined not himself to memorials and re∣monstrances.
Sir Robert Holmes was secretly dis∣patched
with a squadron of twenty-two ships to the
coast of Africa. He not only expelled the Dutch from
Cape Corse, to which the English had some preten∣sions:
He likewise seized the Dutch settlements of Cape
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Isle of Gorce, together with several ships
<PB N="409" REF="503"/>
trading on that coast. And having sailed to America,
he possessed himself of Nova Belgia, since called New
York; a territory, which James the first had given by
patent to the Earl of Sterling, but which had never
been planted but by the Hollanders. When the States
complained of these hostile measures, the King, un∣willing
to avow what he could not well justify, pre∣tended
to be totally ignorant of Holmes's enterprize.
He likewise con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined Holmes to the Tower; but some
time after restored him to his liberty.</P>
<P>THE Dutch, finding that their applications for redress
were likely to be cluded, and that a ground of quarrel
was industriously sought for by the English, began to
arm with diligence. They even exerted, with some
precipitation, an act of vigor, which hastened on the
rupture. Sir John Lawson and de Ruyter had been sent
with combined squadrons into the Mediterranean, in
order to chastise the pyratical States on the coast of Bar∣bary;
and the time of their separation and return was
now approaching. The States secretly dispatched orders
to de Ruyter, that he should take in provisions at Ca∣diz;
and sailing towards the coast of Guinea, should
retaliate on the English, and put the Dutch in possession
of those settlements whence Holmes had expelled them.
De Ruyter, having a considerable force on board, met
with no opposition in Guinea. All the new acquisi∣tions
of the English, except Cape Corse, were recover∣ed
from them. They were even dispossessed of some old
settlements. Such of their ships as fell into his hands
were seized by de Ruyter. That Admiral sailed next to
America. He attacked Barbadoes, but was repulsed.
He afterwards committed hostilities on Long Island.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the English preparations for war were
advancing with vigor and industry. The King had re∣ceived
no supplies from parliament; but by his own
<PB N="410" REF="504"/>
funds and credit he was enabled to equip a fleet: the
city of London lent him 100,000 pounds: the spirit of
the nation seconded his armaments: he himself went
from port to port, inspecting with great diligence, and
encouraging the work: and in a little time the English
navy was put in a very formidable condition. Eight
hundred thousand pounds are said to have been expend∣ed
on this armament. When Lawson arrived, and
communicated his suspicion of de Ruyter's enterprise,
orders were issued for seizing all Dutch ships; and 135
fell into the hands of the English. These were not
confiscated, nor declared prizes, till afterwards, when
war was proclaimed.</P>
<P>THE parliament, when met, granted a supply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of No∣vember. A new session.</NOTE> the
largest by far that had ever been given to a King of
England, but no more than sufficient for the present
undertaking. Near two millions and a half were voted,
to be levied by quarterly payments in three years. The
avidity of the merchants, together with the great pros∣pect
of success, had animated the whole nation against
the Dutch.</P>
<P>A GREAT alteration was made this session in the me∣thod
of taxing the clergy. In almost all the other mo∣narchies
of Europe, the assemblies, whose consent was
formerly requisite to the enacting of laws, were com∣posed
of three estates, the clergy, the nobility, and the
commonalty, which formed so many members of the
political body, of which the King was considered as the
head. In England too, the parliament was always re∣presented
as consisting of three estates; but their sepa∣ration
was never so distinct as in other kingdoms. A
convocation, however, had usually sat at the same time
with the parliament: though they possessed no a nega∣tive
voice in the passing of laws, and assumed no farther
power than that of imposing taxes on the clergy. By
<PB N="411" REF="505"/>
reason of ecclesiastical preferments, which he could be∣stow,
the King's influence over the church was more
considerable than over the laity; so that the subsidies
granted by the convocation, were commonly greater
than those voted by the parliament. The church, there∣fore,
was not displeased to depart tacitly from the right
of taxing herself, and allow the Commons to lay impo∣sitions
on ecclesiastical revenues, as on the rest of the
kingdom. In recompence, two subsidies, which the
convocation had formerly granted, were remitted, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parochial clergy were allowed to vote at elections.
Thus the church of England made a barter of power
for profit. Their convocations, having become useless
to the crown, have been very much di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>used of late
years.</P>
<P>THE Dutch saw, with the utmost regret, a war ap∣proaching,
whence they might dread the most fatal con∣sequences,
but which assorded no prospect of advantage.
They tried every art of negotiation, before they would
come to extremity. Their measures were at that time
directed by John de Wit, a minister equally eminent for
greatness of mind, for capacity, and for integrity. Tho'
moderate in his private deportment, he knew how to
adopt in his public councils that magnanimity, which
suits the minister of a great state. It was ever his
maxim, that no independant government should yield
to another any evident point of reason or equity; and
that all such concessions, so far from preventing war,
served to no other purpose than to provoke fresh claims
and insolencies. By his management a spirit of union
was preserved in all the provinces; great sums were le∣vied;
and a navy was equipped, composed of larger
ships than the Dutch had ever built before, and able to
cope with the fleet of England.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="506"/>
As soon as certain intelligence arrived of de Ruyter's
enterprizes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1665.</NOTE> Charles declared war against the States.
His fleet, consisting of 114 sail, besides fire-ships and
ketches, was commanded by the Duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> and
under him by Prince Rupert and the Earl of Sandwich.
It had about 22,000 men on board. Obdam, who was
admiral of the Dutch navy, of nearly equal force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of June. Victory of the English.</NOTE> de∣clined
not the combat. In the heat of action, when
engaged in close fight with the Duke of York, Ob∣dam's
ship blew up. This accident much discouraged
the Dutch, who fled towards their own coast. Tromp
alone, son of the famous admiral, killed during the Pro∣tectorship,
bravely sustained with his squadron the ef∣forts
of the English, and protected the rear of his coun∣trymen.
The vanquished had nineteen ships sunk and
taken. The victors lost only one. Sir John Lawson
died soon after of his wounds.</P>
<P>IT is affirmed, and with great appearance of reason,
that this victory might have been rendered much more
compleat, had not orders been issued to slacken sail by
Brounker, one of the Duke's bedchamber, who pre∣tended
authority from his master. The Duke disclaimed
the orders; but Brounker never was sufficiently pu∣nished
for his temerity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet sufficiently accounts for Brounker's impunity, by informing us, that he was a favourite of the Dutchess of Cleveland, the King's favourite mistreis.</NOTE>. It is allowed, however, that
the Duke behaved with great bravery during the action.
He was long in the thickest of the fire. The Earl of
Falmouth, Lord Muskerry, and Mr. Boyle, were killed
by one shot at his side, and covered him all over with
their brains and gore. And it is not likely, that in a
pursuit, where even persons of inferior station, and of
the most cowardly disposition, acquire courage, a com∣mander
should feel his spirits to flag, and should turn
<PB N="13" REF="507"/>
from the back of an enemy, whose face he had not
been afraid to encounter.</P>
<P>THIS disaster threw the Dutch into consternation,
and determined de Wit, who was the soul of all their
councils, to exert his military capacity, in order to sup∣port
the declining courage of his countrymen. He went
on board the fleet, which he took under his command;
and he soon remedied all those disorders which had been
occasioned by the late misfortune. The genius of this
man was of the most extensive nature. He quickly be∣came
as much master of naval affairs, as if he had from
his infancy been educated in them; and he even im∣proved
some parts of pilotage and sailing, beyond what
men expert in those arts had ever been able to attain.</P>
<P>THE misfortunes of the Dutch determined their al∣lies
to act for their assistance and support. The King
of France was engaged in a defensive alliance with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE>
States; but as his naval force was yet in its infancy, he
was extremely averse, at that time, from entering into a
war with so formidable a power as England. He tried
long to mediate a peace between the two parties, and
for that purpose sent an embassy to London, which re∣turned
without effecting any thing. Lord Hollis, the
English Ambassador at Paris, endeavoured to draw over
Lewis to the side of England; and, in his master's
name, made him the most tempting offers. Charles
was content to abandon all the Spanish Low Coun∣tries
to the French, without pretending to a foot of
ground for himself; provided Lewis would allow him
to pursue his advantages against the Dutch<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">D'Estrades, 19th of December, 1664.</NOTE>. But the
French Monarch, though the conquest of that valuable
territory was the chief object of his ambition, rejected
the offer as contrary to his interst: he thought, that if
the English had once established an uncontroulable do∣minion
<PB N="414" REF="508"/>
over the sea and over commerce, they would
soon be able to render his acquisitions a very dear pur∣chase
to him. When de Lionne, the French secretary,
assured Van Buninghen, Ambassador of the States, that
this offer had been pressed on his master during six
months, “I can readily believe it,” replied the Dutch∣man;
“I am sensible that it is the interest of Eng∣land<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Id. 14th of August, 1665.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>SUCH were the established maxims at that time with
regard to the interests of Princes. It must however be
allowed, that the politics of Charles in making this of∣fer,
were not a little hazardous. The extreme weak∣ness
of Spain would have rendered the French conquests
easy and infallible: but the vigour of the Dutch, it
might be foreseen, would make the success of the Eng∣lish
much more precarious. And even were the naval
force of Holland totally annihilated, the acquisition of the
Dutch commerce to England could not be relied on as
a certain consequence; nor is trade a constant attendant
of power, but depends on many other, and some of
them very delicate, circumstances.</P>
<P>THO' the King of France was resolved to support the
Hollanders in that unequal contest, in which they were
engaged; he yet protracted his declaration, and em∣ployed
the time in naval preparations, both in the ocean
and the Mediterranean. The King of Denmark mean
while was resolved not to remain an idle spectator of
the contest between the maritime powers. The part
which he acted was the most extraordinary: he made a
secret agreement with Charles to seize all the Dutch
ships in his harbours, and to share the spoils with the
English, provided they would assist him in executing
this measure. In order to increase his prey, he perfi∣diously
invited the Dutch ships to take shelter in his
<PB N="415" REF="509"/>
ports; and accordingly the East India fleet, very richly
laden, had put into Bergen. Sandwich, who now coun∣manded
the English navy (the Duke having gone ashore)
dispatched Sir Thomas Tiddiman with a squadron to
attack them; but whether from the King of Den∣mark's
delay in sending orders to the Governor, or,
what is more probable, from his avidity in endeavour∣ing
to engross the whole booty, the English admiral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Au∣gust.</NOTE>
tho' he behaved with great bravery, failed of his pur∣pose.
The Danish governor fired upon him; and the
Dutch, having had leisure to fortify themselves, made a
very gallant resistance.</P>
<P>THE King of Denmark, seemingly ashamed of his
conduct, concluded with Sir Gilbert Talbot, the Eng∣lish
envoy, an offensive alliance aganst the States;
and at the very same time, his resident at the Hague,
by his orders, concluded an offensive alliance against
England. To this last alliance he adhered, probably
from jealousy of the encreasing naval power of England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with Den∣mark.</NOTE>
and he seized and confiscated all the English ships in
his harbours. This was a very sensible check to the
advantages which Charles had obtained over the Dutch.
Not only a great blow was given to the English com∣merce:
the King of Denmark's naval force was also
considerable, and threatened every moment a conjunc∣tion
with the Hollanders. That Prince stipulated to
assist his allies with a fleet of thirty sail; and he re∣ceived
in return a yearly subsidy of 1,500,000 crowns,
of which 300,000 were paid by France.</P>
<P>THE King endeavoured to counterbalance these con∣federacies
by acqui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing new friends and allies. He had
dispatched Sir Richard Fanshaw into Spain, who met
with a very cold reception. That monarchy was sunk
into a great degree of weakness, and was menaced with
an invasion from France; yet could not any motive
<PB N="416" REF="510"/>
prevail with Philip to enter into a cordial friendship
with England. Charles's alliance with Portugal, the
detention of Jamaica and Tangiers, the sale of Dun∣kirk,
to the French; all these offences sunk so deep in∣to
the mind of the Spanish monarch, that no motive of
interest was sufficient to outweigh them.</P>
<P>The bishop of Munster was the only ally that Charles
could acquire. That prelate, a man of restless enter∣prize
and ambition, had entertained a violent animosity
against the States; and he was easily engaged, by the
promise of subsidies from England, to make an incur∣sion
on that republic. With a tumultuary army of
near 20,000 men, he invaded her territories, and met
with weak resistance. The land forces of the States
were as seeble and ill-governed, as their fleets were
gallant and formidable. But after committing great ra∣vages
in several of the provinces, a stop was put to the
progress of this warlike prelate. He had not military
skill sufficient to improve the advantages which fortune
had offered him. The King of France sent a body of
6000 men to oppose him: subsidies were not regularly
remitted to him from England; and many of his troops
deserted for want of pay: the Elector of Brandenburgh
threatened him with an invasion in his own state: and
on the whole, he was glad to conclude a peace under
the mediation of France. On the first surmise of his
intentions, Sir William Temple was sent from London
with money to fix him in his former alliance; but
found, that he arrived too late.</P>
<P>THE Dutch, encouraged by all these favourable cir∣cumstances,
continued resolute to exert themselves to
the utmost in their own defence. De Ruyter, their
great admiral, was arrived from his expedition to G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣nea:
Their India fleet was come home in safety: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
harbours were crowded with merchant ships: Faction
<PB N="417" REF="511"/>
at home was appeased: The young Prince of Orange
bad put himself under the tuition of the States of Hol∣land,
and of de Wit, their pensionary, who executed his
trust with great honour and fidelity: And the animo∣sity,
which the Hollanders entertained against the at∣tack
of the English, so unprovoked, as they thought it,
made them thirst for revenge, and hope for better suc∣cess
in their next enterprize. Such vigour was exerted
in the common caus, that, in order the better to man
the fleet, all merchant ships were prohibited to sail, and
even the fisheries were totally suspended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tromp's life. D'Estrades, 5th of February, 1665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE English likewise continued in the same disposi∣tion,
though another more grievous calamity had joined
itself to that of war. The plague had broke out in
London; and that with such violence as to cut off, in
less than a year, near 100,000 inhabitants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of Oc∣tober.</NOTE> The King
was obliged to summon the parliament at Oxford.</P>
<P>THE good agreement still continued between the<NOTE PLACE="marg">New session.</NOTE>
King and the parliament. They, on their part, unani∣mously
voted him the supply demanded, twelve hundred
and fifty thousand pounds, to be levied in two years by
monthly assessments. And he, to gratify them, passed
the famous five-mile-act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five-mile∣act.</NOTE> which has given occasion to
such grievous and such just complaints. The church,
under pretence of guarding monarchy against its inve∣terate
enemies, persevered in the project of wracking its
own enmity against the nonconformists. It was enact∣ed,
that no dissenting teacher, who took not the non∣resistance
oath above-mentioned, should, except upon
the road, come within five miles of any corporation, or
of any place, where he had preached after the act of
oblivion. The penalty was a fine of fifty pounds, and
six months imprisonment. By ejecting the noncon∣formist
ministers from their churches, and prohibiting
<PB N="418" REF="512"/>
all separate congregations, they had been rendered inca∣pable
of gaining any livelihood by their spiritual pro∣fession.
And now, under colour of removing them from
places, where their influence might be dangerous, an
expedient was fallen upon to deprive them of all means
of subsistence. Had not the spirit of the nation under∣gone
a change, these violences were preludes to the most
furious persecution.</P>
<P>HOWEVER prevalent the hierarchy, this law did not
pass without opposition. Besides several peers, attached
to the old parliamentary party, Southampton himself,
though Clarendon's great friend, expressed his disap∣probation
of these measures. But the church party, not
discouraged with this opposition, introduced into the
House of Commons a bill for imposing the oath of non∣resistance
on the whole nation. It was rejected only
by three voices. The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31st of Octo∣ber.</NOTE> after a very short
session, was prorogued.</P>
<P>AFTER France had declared war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1666.</NOTE> England was evi∣dently
over-matched in sorce. Yet she possessed this
advantage by her situation, that she lay between the
fleets of her enemies, and might be able, by speedy and
well-concerted operations, to prevent their conjunction.
But such was the unhappy conduct of her commanders,
or such the want of intelligence in her ministers,
that this circumstance turned rather to her prejudice.
Lewis had given orders to the Duke of Beaufort, his
admiral, to sail from Toulon; and the French squa∣dron,
under his command, consisting of above forty
sail<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">D' Estrades, 21st of May, 1666.</NOTE>, was now commonly supposed to be entering the
channel. The Dutch fleet, to the number of seventy-six
sail, was at sea, under the command of de Ruyte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Tromp, in order to join him. The Duke of Al∣bemarle
and Prince Rupert commanded the English
<PB N="419" REF="513"/>
fleet, which exceeded not seventy-four sail. Albemarle,
who, from his successes under the Protectorship, had
too much learned to despise the enemy, proposed to de∣tach
Prince Rupert with twenty ships, in order to op∣pose
the Duke of Beaufort. Sir George Ayscue, well
acquainted with the bravery and conduct of de Ruyter,
protested against the temerity of this resolution: But
Albemarle's authority prevailed. The remainder of the
English set sail to give battle to the Dutch; who, see∣ing
the enemy advance quickly upon them, cut their
cables, and prepared for the combat. The battle,
which ensued, is one of the most memorable, which we
read of in story; whether we consider its duration, or
the desperate courage, with which it was fought.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea fight of four days.</NOTE> Al∣bemarle
made here some atonement by his valour for the
rashness of the attempt. No youth, animated by glory and
ambitious hopes, could exert himself more than did this
man, who was now in the decline of life, and who had
reached the summit of honours. We shall not enter
minutely into particulars. It will be sufficient to men∣tion
the chief events of each day's engagement.</P>
<P>IN the first day, Sir William Berkeley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of June.</NOTE>, Vice-Admi∣ral,
leading the van, fell into the thickest of the ene∣my,
was over-powered, and his ship taken. He him∣self
was found dead in his cabbin, all covered with
blood. The English had the weather-gage of the ene∣my;
but as the wind blew so high, that they could not
use their lower tire, they received small advantage from
this circumstance. The Dutch shot however, fell
chiefly on their sails and rigging; and few ships were
sunk or much damaged. Chain-shot, was at that time
a new invention; which is commonly attributed to de
Wit. Sir John Harman exerted himself extremely this
day. The Dutch Admiral, Evertz, was killed in en∣gaging
him. Darkness parted the combatants.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="514"/>
THE second day, the wind was somewhat fallen, and
the combat became more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leddy and more terrible. The
English now found, that the most heroic valour cannot
compensate the superiority of numbers, against an ene∣my
who is well conducted, and who is not defective in
courage. De Ruyter and Van Tromp, rivals in glory
and enemies from faction, exerted themselves in emula∣tion
of each other; and de Ruyter had the advantage
of disengaging and saving his antagonist who had been
surrounded by the English, and was in the most immi∣nent
danger. Sixteen fresh ships joined the Dutch
fleet during the action: And the English were so shat∣tered,
that, their sighting ships were reduced to twenty-eight,
and they found themselves obliged to retreat to∣words
their own coast. The Dutch followed them,
and were just on the point of renewing the combat;
when a calm, which came a little before night, pre∣vented
the engagement.</P>
<P>NEXT morning, the English were necessitated to con∣tinue
their retreat; and a proper disposition was made
for that purpose. The shattered ships were ordered to
stretch a-head; and sixteen of the most entire followed
them in good order, and kept the enemy in awe. Al∣bemarle
himslef closed the rear, and presented an un∣daunted
countenance to his victorious foes. The Earl
of Ossory, son to Ormond, a gallant youth, who
sought honour and danger in every action throughout
Europe, was then on board the Admiral. Albemarle
confessed to him his intention rather to blow up his
ship and perish gloriously, than yield to the enemy.
Ossory applauded this desperate resolution.</P>
<P>ABOUT two o'clock, the Dutch had come up with
their enemy, and were ready to renew the fight; when
a new fleet was descried from the south, crowding all
their sails to reach the scene of action. The Dutch
flattered themselves that Beaufort was arrived, to cut off
<PB N="421" REF="515"/>
the retreat of the vanquished: The English hoped,
that Prince Rupert had come, to turn the scale of ac∣tion.
Albemarle, who had received intelligence of the
Prince's approach, bent his course towards him. Un∣happily,
Sir George Ayscue, in a ship of a hundred
guns, the largest in the fleet, struck on the Galloper
sands, and could receive no assistance from his friends,
who were hastening to join the reinforcement. He
could not even reap the consolation of perishing glori∣ously,
and revenging his death on his enemies. They
were preparing fireships to attack him, and he was
obliged to strike. The English sailors, seeing the ne∣cessity,
with the utmost indignation surrendered them∣selves
prisoners.</P>
<P>ALBEMARLE and Prince Rupert were now determin∣ed
to face the enemy; and next morning, the battle
began afresh, with more equal sorce than ever, and with
equal valour. After long cannonading, the fleets came
to a more close combat; which was continued with
great violence, till parted by a mist. The English re∣tired
first into their harbours.</P>
<P>THOUGH the English, by their obstinate courage,
reaped the chief honour in this engagement, it is some∣what
uncertain, who obtained the victory. The Hol∣landers
took a few ships; and having some appearances
of advantage, expressed their satisfaction by all the signs
of triumph and rejoicing. But as the English fleet was
repaired in a little time, and put to see more formidable
than ever, together with many of those ships, which
the Dutch had boasted to have burned or destroyed;
all Europe saw that those two brave nations were en∣gaged
in a contest, which was not likely, on either
side, to prove decisive.</P>
<P>IT was the conjunction of the French alone, which
could give the superiority to the Dutch. In order to
facilitate this conjunction, de Ruyter, having repaired
<PB N="422" REF="516"/>
the fleet, posted himself at the mouth of the Thames.
The English under Prince Rupert and Albemarle were
not long in coming to the attack.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of July. Victory of the English.</NOTE> The numbers of
each fleet amounted to about eighty sail; and the valour
and experience of the commanders, as well as of the
seamen, rendered the engagement sierce and obstinate.
Sir Thomas Allen, who commanded the white squa∣dron
of the English, attacked the Dutch van, whom he
entirely routed; and he killed the three Admirals who
commanded it. Van Tromp engaged Sir Jeremy
Smith; and during the heat of action, he was separated
from de Ruyter and the main body, whether by acci∣dent
or design was never certainly known. De Ruyter,
with great conduct and valour, maintained the combat
against the main body of the English; and though over∣powered
by numbers, kept his station, till night ended
the engagement. Next day, finding the Dutch fleet
scattered and discouraged, his high spirit was obliged to
submit to a retreat, which yet he conducted with such
skill, as to render it equally honourable to himself as
the greatest victory. Full of indignation however for
yielding the superiority to the enemy, he frequently ex∣claimed,
“My God! what a wretch am I? among so
“many thousand bullets, is there not one to put an end
to my miserable life?” One de Witte, his son-in-law,
who stood near, exhorted him, since he sought
death, to turn upon the English, and render his life a
dear purchase to the victors. But de Ruyter esteemed
it more worthy a brave man to persevere to the uttermost,
and, as long as possible, to render service to his coun∣try.
All that night and next day, the English pressed
upon the rear of the Dutch; and it was chiefly by the
redoubled efforts of de Ruyter, that the latter saved
themselves in their harbours.</P>
<P>THE loss of the Hollanders in this action was not
very considerable; but as violent animosities had broke
<PB N="423" REF="517"/>
out between the two Admirals, who engaged all the
officers on one side or other, the consternation, which
took place, was very great among the provinces.
Tromp's commission was at last taken from him; but
though several Captains had misbehaved, they were so
well protected by their friends in the magistracy of the
towns, that most of them escaped punishment, many
were still continued in their commands.</P>
<P>THE English now rode incontestible masters of the
sea, and insulted the Dutch in their harbours. A de∣tachment
under Holmes was sent into the road of Vlie,
and burned a hundred and forty merchantmen, two men
of war, together with Brandaris, a large and rich vil∣lage
on the coast. The merchants, who lost by this
enterprize, uniting themselves to the Orange faction,
exclaimed against an administration, which, they pre∣tended,
had brought such disgracce and ruin on their
country. None but the firm and intrepid mind of de
Wit could have supported itself under such a complica∣tion
of calamities.</P>
<P>THE King of France, apprehensive that the Dutch
would sink under their misfortunes; at leas, that de
Wit, his friend, might be dispossessed of the admini∣stration,
hastened the advance of the Duke of Beau∣fort.
The Dutch fleet likewise was again equip∣ped;
and under the command of de Ruyter, cruised
near the Straits of Dover. Prince Rupert with the
English navy, now stronger than ever, came full sail
upon them. The Dutch Admiral thought proper to
decline the combat, and retired into St. John's Road
near Bulloigne. Here he sheltered himself, both from
the English, and from a furious storm, which arose.
Prince Rupert too was obliged to retire into St. Helens;
where he stayed some time, in order to repair the dam∣ages,
which he had sustained. Mean while the Duke
<PB N="424" REF="518"/>
of Beaufort proceeded up the channel, and passed the
English fleet unperceived; but he did not find the
Dutch, as he expected. De Ruyter had been seized with
a fever: Many of the chief officers had fallen into sick∣ness:
A contagious distemper was spread through the
whole fleet: And the States thought it necessary to recal
them into their harbours, before the enemy should be
refited. The French King, anxious for his navy,
which, with so much care and industry, he had lately
built, dispatched orders to Beaufort, to make the best of
his way to Brest. That Admiral had again the good for∣tune
to pass the English. One ship alone, the Ruby,
fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>WHILE the war continued without any decisive suc∣cess
on either side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep∣tember. Fire of Lon∣don.</NOTE> a dreadful calamity happened in
London, which threw the people into great consterna∣tion.
A fire, breaking out in a baker's house near the
bridge, spread itself on all sides with such rapidity, that
no efforts could extinguish it, till it laid in ashes a con∣siderable
part of the city. The inhabitants, without be∣ing
able to do any thing effectual for their relief, were
reduced to be spectators of their own ruin; and were
pursued from street to street by the flames, which un∣expectedly
gathered round them. Three days and nights
did the fire advance; and it was only by the blowing up
of houses, that it was at last extinguished. The King
and Duke used their utmost endeavours to stop the pro∣gress
of the flames; but all their industry was unsuc∣cessful.
About four hundred streets, and thirteen thou∣sand
houses were reduced to ashes.</P>
<P>THE causes of this calamity were evident. The nar∣row
streets of London, the houses built intirely of wood,
the dry season, and a violent cast wind which blew;
these were so many concurring circumstances, which
rendered it easy to assign the reason of the destruction
<PB N="425" REF="519"/>
that ensued. But the people were not satisfied with this
obvious account. Prompted by blind rage, some ascribed
the guilt to the republicans, others to the catholics;
though it is not easy to conceive how the burning of
London could serve the purposes of either party. As
the papists were the chief objects of public detestation,
the rumour, which threw the guilt on them, was more
favourably received by the people. No proof however,
or even presumption, after the strictest enquiry by a
committee of parliament, ever appeared to authorize
such a calumny; yet in order to give countenance to
the popular prejudice, the inscription, engraved by au∣thority
on the monument, ascribed this calamity to that
hated sect. This clause was erazed by order of King
James, when he came to the throne; but after the re∣volution
it was replaced. So credulous, as well as ob∣stinate,
are the people, in believing every thing, which
slatters their prevailing passion!</P>
<P>THE fire of London, though at that time a great ca∣lamity,
has proved in the issue beneficial both to the
city and the kingdom. The city was rebuilt in a very
little time; and care was taken to make the streets
wider and more regular than before. A discretionary
power was assumed by the King to regulate the distri∣bution
of the buildings, and to forbid the use of lath
and timber, the materials, of which the houses were
formerly composed. The necessity was so urgent, and
the occasion so extraordinary, that no exceptions were
made to an exercise of authority, which otherwise
might have been esteemed illegal. Had the King been
enabled to carry his power still farther, and made the
houses be rebuilt with perfect regularity, and entirely
upon one plan; he had much contributed to the con∣venience,
as well as embellishment of the city. Great
advantages, however, have resulted from the alterations;
<PB N="426" REF="520"/>
though not carried to the full length. London became
much more healthy after the fire. The plague, which
used to break out with great fury twice or thrice every
century, and indeed was always lurking in some corner
or other of the city, has not once discovered itself since
that calamity.</P>
<P>THE parliament met soon after, and gave the sanction
of law to those regulations made by royal authority; as
well as appointed commissioners for deciding all such
questions of property, as might arise from the fire. They
likewise voted a supply of 1,800,000 pounds to be le∣vied,
partly by a poll-bill, partly by assessments. Tho'
their enquiry brought out no proofs, which could fix on
the papists the burning of London, the general aversion
against that sect still prevailed; and complaints were
made, probably without much soundation, of its dan∣gerous
increase. Charles, at the desire of the Com∣mons,
issued a proclamation for the banishment of all
priests and jesuits; but the bad execution of this, as
well as of former edicts, destroyed all confidence in his
sincerity, whenever he pretended an aversion towards
the catholic religion. Whether suspicions of this na∣ture
had diminished the King's popularity, is uncertain;
but it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1667.</NOTE> that the supply was voted much later
than Charles expected, or even than the public necessi∣ties
seemed to require. The intrigues of the Duke of
Buckingham, a man who wanted only steadiness to ren∣der
him extremely dangerous, had somewhat embarrass∣ed
the measures of the court: And this was the first
time that the King found any considerable reason to
complain of a failure of confidence in this House of
Commons. The rising symptoms of ill humour tended,
no doubt, to quicken the steps, which were already
making towards a peace with foreign enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="521"/>
CHARLES began to be sensible, that all the ends, for
which the war had been undertaken, were likely to
prove entirely ineffectual.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advances towards peace.</NOTE> The Dutch, even when
alone, had defended themselves with great vigor, and
were every day improving in their military skill and pre∣parations.
Though their trade had suffered extremely,
their extensive credit enabled them to levy prodigious
sums; and while the seamen of England loudly com∣plained
of want of pay, the Dutch navy was regularly
supplied with every thing requisite for its subsistence.
As two powerful Kings now supported them, every
place, from the extremity of Norway to the coasts of
Bayonne, was become hostile to the English. And
Charles, neither fond of action, nor stimulated by any
violent ambition, gladly sought for means of restoring
tranquillity to his people, heartily disgusted with a war,
which, being joined with the plague and fire, had
proved so fruitless and destructive.</P>
<P>THE first advances towards an accommodation were
made by England. When the King sent for the body
of Sir William Berkeley, he insinuated to the States his
desire of peace on reasonable terms; and their answer
corresponded in the same amicable intentions. Charles,
however, to maintain the appearance of superiority, still
insisted, that the States should treat at London; and
they agreed to make him this compliment so far as con∣cerned
themselves: But being engaged in alliance with
two crowned heads, they could not, they said, prevail with
these to depart in that respect from their dignity. On a
sudden, the King went so far on the other side as to of∣fer
the sending Ambassadors to the Hague; but this
proposal, which seemed honourable to the Dutch, was
meant only to divide and distract them, by affording the
English an opportunity to carry on cabals with the dis∣affected
party. The offer was therefore rejected; and
conferences were secretly held in the Queen mother's
<PB N="428" REF="522"/>
apartments at Paris, where the pretensions of both par∣ties
were discussed. The Dutch made very equitable
proposals; either that all things should be restored to
the same condition in which they stood before the war;
or that both parties should continue in possession of their
present acquisitions. Charles accepted the latter propo∣sal;
and almost every thing was adjusted, except the
disputes with regard to the isle of Polerone. This
island lies in the East Indies, and was formerly valuable
for its product of spices. The English had been mas∣ters
of it; but were dispossessed at the time when the
violences had been committed against them at Amboyna.
Cromwel had stipulated to have it restored; and the
Hollanders, having first entirely destroyed all the spice
trees, maintained, that they had executed the treaty,
but that the English had been anew expelled during the
course of the war. Charles renewed his pretensions to
this island; and as the reasons on both sides began to
multiply, and seemed to require a long discussion, it
was agreed to transfer the treaty to some other place;
and Charles made choice of Breda.</P>
<P>LORD Hollis and Henry Coventry were the English
Ambassadors. They immediately desired, that a suspen∣sion
of arms should be agreed to, till the several claims
should be adjused: But this proposal, seemingly so na∣tural,
was rejected by the interest of de Wit. That
penetrating and active minister, thoroughly acquainted
with the characters of Princes and the situation of af∣fairs,
had discovered an opportunity of striking a blow,
which might at once restore to the Dutch the honour
lost during the war, and severely revenge those injuries,
which he ascribed to the wanton ambition and injustice
of the English.</P>
<P>WHATEVER projects might have been formed by
Charles for secreting the money granted him by parlia∣ment,
he had hitherto failed in his intention. The ex∣pences
<PB N="429" REF="523"/>
of such vast armaments had exhausted all the
supplies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Dutch had spent on the war near 40 millions of livres a year, above 3 millions sterling: A much greater sum than had been granted by the Eng∣lish parliament. D'Estrades, 24th of December 1665; 1st of January 1666. Temple, vol. i. p. 71. It was probably the want of money which engaged the King to pay the seamen with tickets; a contrivance which proved so much to their los<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>; and even a great debt was contracted to the
seamen. The King therefore was resolved to save as
far as possible, the last supply of 1,80,000 pounds;
and to employ it for payment of his debts, as well those
occasioned by the war, as those which either necessity,
or pleasure, or generosity had formerly engaged him to
contract. He observed, that the Dutch had been with
great reluctance forced into the war, and that the events
of it were not such as to inspire them with great desire
of its continuance. The French, he knew, had been
engaged into hostilities by no other motive than that of
supporting their allies; and were now more desirous
than ever of putting an end to the quarrel. The dis∣ferences
between the parties were so inconsiderable, that
the conclusion of peace appeared absolutely insallible;
and nothing but forms, or at least some vain points of
honour, seemed to remain for the Ambassadors at Breda
to discuss. In this situation, Charles, allured by the
prospect of gain, rashly remitted his preparations, and
exposed England to one of the greatest affronts, which
it has ever received. Two small squadrons alone were
equipped; and during a war with such potent and mar∣tial
enemies, every thing was left almost in the same
situation as in times of the most profound tranquillity.</P>
<P>DE WIT protracted the negotiations at Breda, and
hastened the naval preparations. The Dutch fleet ap∣peared
in the Thames under the command of de Ruy∣ter,
and threw the English into the utmost consterna∣tion.
A chain had been drawn cross the river Medway;
some fortifications had been added to Sheerness and Up∣nore
<PB N="430" REF="524"/>
castle: But all these preparations were unequal to
the present necessity. Sheerness was soon taken; nor
could it be saved by the valour of Sir Edward Sprague,
who defended it. Having the advantage of a spring
tide, and an easterly wind, the Dutch pressed on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of June Disgrace at Chatham.</NOTE> and
broke the chain, though fortified by some ships, which
had been there sunk by order of the Duke of Albe∣marle.
They burned the three ships, which lay to guard
the chain, the Matthias, the Unity, and the Charles
the fifth. After damaging several vessels, and possessing
themselves of the hull of the Royal Charles, which the
English had burned, they advanced with six men of war,
and five fire-ships, as far as Upnore castle, where they
burned the Royal Oak, the Loyal London, and the Great
James. Captain Douglas, who commanded on board the
Royal Oak, perished in the flames, tho' he had an easy op∣portunity
of escaping. “Never was it known,” he said,
“that a Douglas had left his post without orders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. ii. p. 41.</NOTE>.”
The Hollanders fell down the Medway without receiv∣ing
any considerable damage; and it was apprehended,
that they might next tide fail up the Thames, and ex∣tend
their hostilities even to the bridge of London.
Nine ships were sunk at Woolwich, four at Blackwall:
Platforms were raised in many places, furnished with
artillery: The train bands were called out; and every
place was full of the utmost disorder, The Dutch
sailed next to Portsmouth, where they made a fruitless
attempt: They met with no better success at Ply∣mouth:
They insulted Harwich: They sailed again up
the Thames as far as Tilbury, where they were repul∣sed.
The whole coast was in alarm; and had the
French thought proper at this time to join the Dutch
fleet, and to invade England, consequences the most
fatal might justly have been apprehended. But Lewis
had no intention to push the victory to such extremi∣ties.
<PB N="431" REF="525"/>
His interest required, that a ballance should be
kept between the two maritime powers; not that an
uncontrouled superiority should be given to either.</P>
<P>Great indignation prevailed amongst the English, to
see an enemy, whom they regarded as inferior, whom
they had expected totally to subdue, and over whom
they had gained many honourable advantages, now of a
sudden ride undisputed masters of the ocean, burn their
ships in their very harbours, sill every place with
confusion, and strike a terror into the capital itself.
But though the cause of all these disasters could be
asscribed neither to bad fortune, to the misconduct
of admirals, nor the misbehaviour of semen, but
solely to the avarice, at least to the improvi∣dence,
of the government; no dangerous symptoms of
discontent appeared, and no attempt for an insurrection
was made by any of those numerous sectaries, who had
been so openly branded for their rebellious principles,
and who upon that supposition had been treated with
such severity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Some nonconformists however, both in Scotland and England, had kept a correspondence with the States, and had entertained projects for insurrections, but they were too weak even to attempt the execution of them. D'Estrades, 13th of October, 1665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the present distress, two expedients were em∣braced:
An army of 12,000 men was suddenly levied;
and the parliament, though it lay under prorogation,
was summoned to meet. The houses were very thin;
and the only vote, which the Commons passed, was an
address for breaking the army; which was complied
with. This expression of jealousy shewed the court
what they might expect from that assembly; and it was
thought most prudent to prorogue them till next winter.</P>
<P>BUT the signing the treaty at Breda, extricated the<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of July Peace of Bre∣da.</NOTE>
King from his present difficulties. The English Am∣bassadors
received orders to recede from those demands,
<PB N="432" REF="526"/>
which, however frivolous in themselves, could not now
be relinquished, without acknowledging a superiority in
the enemy. Polerone remained with the Dutch; satisfac∣tion
for the ships, Bonaventure and Good-hope, the pre∣tended
grounds of the quarrel, was no longer insisted on;
Acadie was yielded to the French. The acquisition of
New-York, a settlement so important by its situation,
was the chief advantage which the English reaped
from a war, in which the national character of bra∣very
had shone out with great lustre, but where the
misconduct of the government, especially in the con∣clusion
had been no less apparent.</P>
<P>To appease the people by some sacrifice seemed re∣quisite<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon's fall.</NOTE>
quisite before the meeting of the parliament; and the
prejudices of the nation plainly pointed out the victim.
The Chancellor was at this time much exposed to the
hatred of the public, and of every party, which divided
the nation. All the numerous sectaries regarded him as
their determined enemy; and ascribed to his advice
and influence, those persecuting laws, to which they
had so long been exposed. The catholics knew, that
while he retained any authority, all their credit with
the King and the Duke would be entirely useless to
them, nor must they ever expect any favour or indul∣gence.
Even the royalists, disappointed in their san∣guine
hopes of preserment, threw a great load of envy
on Clarendon, into whose hands the King seemed at
first to have resigned the whole power of government.
The sale of Dunkik, the bad payment of the seamen,
the disgrace at Chatham, the unsuccessful conclusion of
the war; all these misfortunes were charged on the
Chancellor, who, though he had ever opposed the rup∣ture
with Holland, thought it still his duty to justify
what he could not prevent. A building likewise of
more expence and magnificence than his slender fortune
could afford, being unwarily undertaken by him, much
<PB N="433" REF="527"/>
exposed him to public reproach, as if he had acquired
great riches by corruption. The populace gave it com∣monly
the appellation of Dunkirk House.</P>
<P>THE King himself, who had always more revered
than loved the Chancellor, was now totally estranged
from him. Amidst the dissolute manners of the court,
that minister still maintained an inflexible dignity, and
would not submit to any condescensions, which he
deemed unworthy his age and character. Buckingham,
a man of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igate morals, happy in his talent of ridi∣cule,
but exposed in his own conduct to all the ridi∣cule,
but exposed in his own conduct to all the ridi∣cule,
which he threw on others, still made him the ob∣ject
of his raillery, and gradually lessened in the King
that regard, which he bore to his minister. When any
difficulties arose, either for want of power or money,
the blame was still cast on him, who, it was believed,
had carefully at the restoration checked all lavish con∣cessions
to the King. And what perhaps touched
Charles more nearly, he found in Clarendon, it is said,
obstacles to his pleasure as well as to his ambition.</P>
<P>THE King disgusted with the homely person of his
spouse, and desirous of having children, had hearkened
to proposals of obtaining a divorce, on pretence either
of her being pre-engaged to another, or of having made
a vow of chastity before her marriage. He was farther
stimulated by his passion for Mrs. Stuart, daughter to a
Scots gentleman; a lady of great beauty, and whose
virtue he had hitherto sound impregnable: But Claren∣don,
apprehensive of the consequences attending a dis∣puted
title, and perhaps anxious for the succession of
his grandchildren, engaged the Duke of Richmond to
marry Mrs. Stuart, and thereby put an end to the
King's hopes. It is pretended, that Charles never for∣gave
this disappointment.</P>
<P>WHEN politics, therefore, and inclination both con∣curred
to make the King sacrifice Glarendon to popular
<PB N="434" REF="528"/>
prejudices, the memory of his past services was not able any
longer to delay his fall. The seals were taken from him,
and given to Sir Orlando Bridgeman. Southampton the
Treasurer was now dead, who had persevered to the utmost
in his attachments to the Chancellor. The last time he
appeared at the council board, he exerted his friendship
with a vigour, which neither age nor insirmities could
abate. “This man,” said he, speaking of Clarendon,
“is a true protestant, and an honest Englishman; and
while he enjoys power, we are secure of our laws,
liberties, and religion. I dread the consequences of
his removal.”</P>
<P>BUT the fall of the Chancellor was not sufficient to
gratify the malice of his enemies: His total ruin was
resolved on. The Duke of York in vain exerted his
interest in behalf of his father-in-law. Both Prince and
people united in promoting that violent measure; and
no means were thought so proper for ingratiating the
court with a parliament, which had so long been go∣verned
by that very minister, who was now to be the
victim of their prejudices.</P>
<P>SOME popular acts paved the way for the session;
and the parliament, in their first address, gave the King
thanks for these instances of his goodness, and among
the rest, they took care to mention his dismission of
Clarendon. The King, in reply, assured the Houses,
that he would never again employ that nobleman in
any public office whatsoever. Immediately, the charge
against him was opened in the House of Commons
by Mr. Seymour, afterwards Sir Edward, and con∣sisted of seventeen articles. The House, without
examining particulars, farther than hearing gene∣ral
affirmations, that all would be proved, immedi∣ately
voted his impeachment. Many of the articles<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">The articles were, that he had advised the King to govern by military power without parliaments, that he had affirmed the King to be a papist or popishly affected, that he had received great sums of money for procuring the Canary patent, and other illegal patents, that he had advised and procured divers of his Majesty's subjects to be imprisoned against law, in remote islands and gar∣risons, thereby to prevent their having the benefit of the law, that he had procured the customs to be farmed at under-rates, that he received great sums from the Vintners' Company, for allowing them to inhance the price of wines, that he had in a short time gained a greater estate than could have been supposed to arise from the profits of his offices, that he had introduced an ar∣bitrary government into his Majesty's plantations, that he had rejected a pro∣posal for the preservation of Nevis and St. Christophers, which was the occa∣sion of great losses in those parts, that when he was in his Majesty's service beyond sea he held a correspondence with Cromwel and his accomplices, that he advised the sale of Dunkirk, that he had unduly altered Jetters patent under the King's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal, that he had unduly decided causes in council. which should have been brought before chancery, that he had issued quo warrantos against corporations with an intention of squezing money from them, that he had taken money for passing the bill of settlement of Ireland, that he betrayed the nation in all foreign treaties, and that he was the principal adviser of dividing the fleet in June 1666.</NOTE>
<PB N="435" REF="529"/>
we know to be either false or srivolous; and such of
them, as we are less acquainted with, we may fairly
presume to be no better grounded. His advising the
sale of Dunkirk, seems the heaviest and truest part of
the charge; but a mistake in judgment, allowing it to
be such, where there appears no symptoms of corruption
or bad inten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ons, it would be very hard to charge as a
crime on any minister. The King's necessities, which
occasioned that measure, cannot with any appearance of
reason be imputed to Clarendon; and chiefly proceeded
from the over-frugal maxims of the parliament itself, in
not granting the proper supplies to the crown.</P>
<P>WHEN the charge was carried up to the Peers, as it
contained an accusation of treason in general, without
specifying any particulars, it seemed not a sufficient
ground for committing Clarendon to custody. The
precedents of Strafford and Laud were not, by reason of
the violence of the times, deemed a proper autho∣rity;
but as the Commons still insisted upon his com∣mitment,
it was necessary to appoint a free conference
<PB N="436" REF="530"/>
between the Houses. The Lords persevered in their re∣solution;
and the Commons voted this conduct to be an
obstruction to public justice, and a precedent of evil and
dangerous consequence. They also chose a committee
to draw up a vindication of their own proceedings.</P>
<P>CLARENDON, finding that the popular torrent, united
to the violence of power, ran with great impetuosity
against him, and that a defence, offered to such pre∣judiced
ears, would be entirely ineffectual, thought pro∣per
to withdraw himself. At Calais, he wrote a paper
addressed to the House of Lords. He there said, that his
fortune, which was but moderate, had been gained entirely
by the lawful, avowed profits of his office, and by the
voluntary bounty of the King; that during the first
years after the restoration he had always concurred in
opinion with the other counsellors, men of such repu∣tation
that no one could entertain suspicions of their
wisdom or integrity; that his credit soon declined, and
however he might disapprove of some measures, he
sound it in vain to oppos them; that his repugnance
to the Dutch war, the source of all the public griev∣ances,
was always generally known, as well as his dis∣approbation
of many unhappy steps taken in conduct∣ing
it; and that whatever pretence might be made of
national offences, his real crime, that which had exa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣perated
his powerful enemies, was his frequent oppos∣tion
to oxorbitant grants, which the importunity of
sitors had extorted from his Majesty.</P>
<P>THIS paper the Lords transmitted to the Commons
under the appellation of a libel; and by a vote of both
Houses, it was condemned to be burned by the hands of
the hangman. They next proceeded to exert their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
power against Clarendon, and passed a bill of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and incapacity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> which received the royal
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> retired into France, where he lived in a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. He survived his banishment six years;
<PB N="437" REF="531"/>
and he employed his leisure chiefly in reducing into or∣der
the History of the Civil Wars, for which he had
before collected materials. The performance does great
honour to his memory; and, except Whitelock's Me∣morials,
is the most candid account of those times,
composed by any cotemporary author.</P>
<P>CLARENDON was always a friend to the liberty and
the constitution of his country. At the commencement
of the civil wars, he had entered into the late King's
service, and was honoured with a great share in the
esteem and friendship of that monarch: He was pursued
with unrele<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting animosity by the Long Parliament:
He had shared all the sortunes and directed all the coun∣cils
of the present King during his exile: He had been
advanced to the highest trust and offices after the resto∣ration:
Yet all these circumstances, which might na∣turally
operate with such force, either on re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entment,
gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itude, or ambition, had no influence on his uncor∣rupted
mind. It is said, that when he first engaged in
the study of the law, his father exhorted him with great
earnestness to shun the practice too common in that pro∣fession,
of straining every point in favour of preroga∣tive,
and perverting so useful a science to the oppression
of liberty: And in the midst of these rational and vir∣tious
councils, which he re-iterated, he was suddenly
seized with an apoplexy, and expired in his son's pre∣sence.
This circumstance gave additional weight to the
principles, which he inculcated.</P>
<P>THE combination of King and subject to oppress so
good a minister affords, to men of opposite dispositions,
an equal occasion of inveighing against the ingratitude
of Princes, or ignorance of the people. Charles seems
never to have mitigated his resentment against Claren∣don;
and the national prejudices pursued him to his re∣treat
in France. A company of English soldiers, be∣ing
<PB N="438" REF="532"/>
quartered near him, assaulted his house, broke open
the doors, gave him a dangerous wound on the head,
and would have proceeded to the last extremity, had
not their officers, hearing of the violence, happily in∣terposed</P>
<P>THE next expedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668.</NOTE> which the King embraced, in
order to acquire popularity, is much more deserving of
praise; and, had it been steadily pursued, would pro∣bably
have rendered his reign happy, certainly his me∣mory
glorious. It is the Triple Alliance of which I
speak; a measure, which gave entire satisfaction to the
public.</P>
<P>THE glory of France, which had long been eclipsed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
either by domestic factions, or by the superior force of
the Spanish monarchy, began now to break out with
great lu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tre, and to engage the attention of all the
neighbouring nations: The independant power and
mutinous spirit of the nobility were subdued: The po∣poular
pretensions of the parliament restrained: The Hu∣gonot
party reduced to subjection: That extensive and
sertile country, possessed of every advantage both of cli∣mate
and situation, was fully peopled with ingenious
and industrious inhabitants: And while the spirit of the
nation discovered all the vigour and bravery requisite for
great enterprizes, it was tamed to an entire submission
under the will of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>THE Sovereign, who now filled the throne, was well
adapted, by his personal character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Lewis XIV.</NOTE>, both to increase and
to avail himself of these mighty advantages. Lewis the
fourteenth, endowed with every quality, which could
enchant the people, posses<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied many which merit the ap∣probation
of the wise. The masculine beauty of his
person was embellished with a noble air: The dignity of
his behaviour was tempered with the highest affability
<PB N="439" REF="533"/>
and politeness: Elegant without effeminacy, addicted
to pleasure without neglecting business, decent in his
very vices, and beloved in the midst of arbitrary power;
he surpassed all cotemporary monarchs, as in grandeur,
so likewise in fame and glory.</P>
<P>His ambition, regulated by prudence, not by justice,
had carefully provided every means of conquest; and
before he put himself in motion, he seemed to have ab∣solutely
ensured success. His finances were brought
into order: A naval power created: His armies in∣creased
and disciplined: Magazines and military stores
provided: And though the magnificence of his court
was supported beyond all former example, so regular
was the occonomy observed, and so willingly did the
people, now enriched by arts and commerce, subimit to
mutliplied taxes, that his military force much exceeded
what in any preceding age had ever been employed by
any European monarch.</P>
<P>THE sudden decline and almost total fall of the Spa∣nish
monarchy opened an inviting field to so enterpris∣ing
a Prince, and seemed to promise him an easy and
universal conquest. The other nations of Europe,
seeble or ill-governed, were astonished at the great∣ness
of his rifing empire; and all of them cast their
eyes towards England, as the only power, which could
save them from that subjection, with which they were
so nearly threatened.</P>
<P>THE animosity, which had antiently subsisted be∣tween
the English and French nations, and which had
been suspended for above a century by the jealousy of
Spanish greatness, began to revive and to exert itself.
The glory of preserving the ballance of Europe, a glory
so much founded on justice and humanity, flattered the
ambition of England; and the whole people were eager
to provide for their own future security, by opposing
<PB N="440" REF="534"/>
the progress of so hated a rival. The prospect of em∣bracing
such measures had contributed, among other
reasons, to render the peace of Breda so universally ac∣ceptable
to the nation. By the death of Philip the
fourth, King of Spain, an inviting opportunity, and
some very slender pretences, had been afforded to call
forth the ambition of Lewis.</P>
<P>AT the treaty of the Pyrenees, when Lewis espoused
the Spanish Princess, he had renounced every title of
succession to every part of the Spanish monarchy; and
this renounciation had been couched in the most accu∣rate
and most precise terms, which language could af∣ford.
But on the death of his father-in-law, he retracted
his renounciation, and pretended, that natural rights,
depending on blood and succession, could not be anni∣hilated
by any extorted deed or contract. Philip had lest
a son, Charles the second of Spain; but as the Queen
of France was of a former marriage, she laid claim to
a considerable province of the Spanish monarchy, even
to the exclusion of her brother. By the customs of some
parts of Brabant, a female of a first marriage was pre∣ferred
to a male of a second, in the succession to private
inheritances; and Lewis thence inferred, that his Queen
had acquired a right to the dominion of that important
dutchy.</P>
<P>A CLAIM of this nature was more properly supported
by military force than by argument and reasoning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">French in∣vasion of the Low Coun∣tries.</NOTE>
Lewis appeared on the frontiers of the Netherlands with
a numerous army of 40,000 men, commanded by the
best generals of the age, and provided of every thing
necessary for action. The Spaniards, though they might
have foreseen this measure, were totally unprepared.
Their towns, without magazines, without fortifications,
without garrisons, fell into the hands of the French
King, as soon as he presented himself before them.
<PB N="441" REF="535"/>
Athe, Lisle, Tournay, Oudenarde, Courtray, Charleroi,
Binche were immediately taken: And it was visible,
that no force in the Low Countries was able to stop or
retard the progress of the French arms.</P>
<P>THIS measure, executed with so much celerity and suc∣cess,
gave great alarm to almost every court in Europe. It
had been observed with what dignity, or even haughti∣ness,
Lewis, from the time he began to govern, had
ever supported all his rights and pretensions. D'Estrades,
the French Ambassador, and Watteville, the Spanish,
having quarrelled in London, on account of their preten∣sion
for precedency, the French monarch was not satis∣fied,
till Spain sent to Paris a solemn embassy, and pro∣mised
never more to revive such contests. Crequi,
his Ambassador in Rome, had met with an affront from
the Pope's guards. The Pope, Alexander the seventh,
had been obliged to break his guards, to dispatch his
newphew to ask pardon, and to allow a pillar to be erect∣ed
in Rome itself, as a monument of his own humilia∣tion.
The King of England too had experienced the
high spirit and unsubmitting temper of Lewis. A claim
of precedency in the English flag having been advan∣ced,
the French monarch remonstrated with such vig∣our,
and prepared himself to resist with such courage,
that Charles found it more prudent to desist from his
pretensions. The King of England, said Lewis to his
Ambassador D'Estrades, may know my force, but he
knows not the sentiments of my heart: Every thing
appears to me contemptible in comparison of glory<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">25th of January, 1662.</NOTE>.
These measures of conduct had given strong indications
of his character: But the invasion of Flanders discover∣ed
an ambition, which, being supported by such over∣grown
power, menaced the general liberties of Europe.</P>
<P>As no State lay nearer the danger, none was seized
with more terror than the United Provinces. They
<PB N="442" REF="536"/>
were still engaged, together with France, in a war
against England; and Lewis had promised them, that
he would take no steps against Spain without previously
informing them: But, contrary to this assurance, he kept
a total silence, till on the very point of entering upon
action. If the renounciation, made at the treaty of the
Pyrenees, was not valid, it was foreseen, that, upon
the death of the King of Spain, a sickly in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant, the
whole monarchy would be claimed by Lewis; after
which it would be vainly expected to set bounds to his
pretensions. Charles, acquainted with these well-grounded
apprehensions of the Dutch, had been the
more obstinate in insisting on conditions at Breda; and
by delaying to sign the treaty, had imprudently exposed
himself to the signal disgrace, which he received at
Chatham. De Wit, sensible, that a few week's delay
would be of no consequence in the Low Countries,
took this opportunity of striking an important blow,
and of finishing the war with honour to himself and to
his country.</P>
<P>NEGOTIATIONS<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations.</NOTE> meanwhile commenced for the sav∣ing
Flanders; but no resistance was made to the French
arms. The Spanish ministers exclaimed every where
against the flagrant injustice of Lewis's pretensions, and
represented it to be the interest of every power in Eu∣rope,
even more than of Spain itself, to prevent his
conquest of the Low Countries. The Emperor and the
German Princes discovered evident symptoms of discon∣tent;
but their motions were flow and backward. The
States, though terrified at the prospect of having their
frontiers exposed to so formidable a foe, saw no resource,
no means of safety. England indeed seemed disposed to
make opposition to the French; but the variable and
impolitic conduct of Charles kept that republic from
making him any open advances, by which they might
lose the friendship of France, without acquiring any
<PB N="443" REF="537"/>
new ally. And though Lewis, dreading a combination
of all Europe, had offered terms of accommodation,
the Dutch apprehended lest these, either from the ob∣stinacy
of the Spaniards, or the ambition of the
French, would never be carried into execution.</P>
<P>CHARLES resolved with great prudence to take the
first step towards a confederacy. Sir William Temple,
his resident at Brussels, received orders to go secretly to
the Hague, and to concert with the States the means of
saving the Netherlands. This man, whom philosophy
had taught to despise the world, without rendering him
unfit for it, was frank, open, sincere, superior to the
little tricks of vulgar politicians: And meeting in de
Wit with a man of the same generous and enlarged
sentiments, he immediately opened his master's inten∣tion,
and pressed a speedy conclusion. A treaty was
from the first negotiated between these two statesmen
with the same cordiality, as if it were a private affair,
transacted between two intimate companions. Deeming
the interss of their country the same, they gave full
scope to that sympathy of character, which disposed
them to an intire reliance on each others professions and
engagements. And though the jealousy against the
house of Orange might inspire de Wit with an aversion
to a strict union with England, he generously resolved
to sacrifice all private considerations to the public ser∣vice.</P>
<P>TEMPLE pressed an offensive league between England
and Holland, in order to oblige France to relinquish all
her conquests: But de Wit told him, that this measure
was too bold and precipitant to be agreed to by the
States. He said, that the French were the old and
constant allies of the republic; and till matters came to
extremity, she never would deem it prudent to abandon
a friendship so well established, and rely entirely on a
<PB N="444" REF="538"/>
treaty with England, which had lately waged so cruel a
war against her: That ever since the reign of Elizabeth,
there had been such a fluctuation in the English coun∣cils,
that it was not possible, for two years together, to
take any sure or certain measures with that kingdom:
That though the present ministry, having entered into
views so conformable to national interest, promised
greater firmness and constancy, it might still be unsafe,
in a business of such consequence, to put entire confi∣dence
in them: That the French monarch was young,
haughty, and powerful; and if treated in so imperious
a manner, would expose himself to the greatest extremi∣ties
rather than submit: That it was sufficient, if he
could be constrained to adhere to the offers, which he him∣self
had already made; and if the remaining provinces of
the Low Countries could be thereby saved from the
danger, with which they were at present threatned:
And that the other powers, in Germany and the north,
whose assistance they might expect, would be satisfied
with putting a stop to the French conquests, without
pretending to recover the places, which were already
lost.</P>
<P>THE English Ambassador was contented to accept of
the terms, proposed by the pensionary. Lewis had of∣fered
to relinquish all the Queen's rights on condition
either of keeping the conquests, which he had made
last campaign, or of receiving, in lieu of them, Franche∣comté,
together with Cambray, Aire, and St. Omers.
De Wit and Temple founded their treaty upon this pro∣posal.
They agreed to offer their mediation to the con∣tending
powers, and oblige France to adhere to this al∣ternative,
and Spain to accept of it. If Spain refused,
they agreed, that France should not prosecute her claim
by arms, but leave it entirely to England and Holland
to employ force for making the terms effectual. And
the remainder of the Low Countries they thenceforth
<PB N="445" REF="539"/>
guaranteed to Spain. A defensive treaty was likewise
concluded between Holland and England.</P>
<P>THE articles of this confederacy were soon adjusted
by such candid and able negotiators: But the greatest
difficulty still remained. By the constitution of the re∣public,
all the towns in all the provinces must give their
consent to every treaty; and besides that this formality
could not be dispatched in less than two months, it
was justly to be dreaded, that the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence of France
would obstruct the passage of the treaty in some of the
smaller cities. D'Estrades, the French Ambassador, a
man of great ability, hearing of the league, which was
on the carpet, treated it very lightly; “Six weeks
hence,” said he, “we shall speak to it.” To ob∣viate
this difficulty, de Wit had the courage, for the
public good, to break through the laws in so fundamen∣tal
an article; and by his authority, he prevailed with
the States General at once to sign and ratify the league:
Though they acknowledged, that, if that measure<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Ja∣nuary.</NOTE> should displease their constituents, they risqued their
heads by this irregularity. After sealing, all parties
embraced with great cordiality. Temple cried out, <HI>At
Breda, as friends: Here, as brothers.</HI> And de Wit add∣ed,
that now the matter was finished, it looked like a
miracle.</P>
<P>ROOM had been left in the treaty for the accession of
Sweden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triple league.</NOTE> which was soon after obtained; and thus was
concluded in five days the triple league; an event re∣ceived
with equal surprise and approbation by the world.
Notwithstanding the unfortunate conclusion of the last
war, England now appeared in her proper station, and,
by this wise conduct, had recovered all her influence
and credit in Europe. Temple likewise received great
applause; but to all the compliments made him on that
occasion, he modestly replied: That to remove things
<PB N="446" REF="540"/>
from their center, or proper element, required force
and labour; but that of themselves they easily returned
to it.</P>
<P>THE French monarch was extremely displeased with
this measure. Not only bounds were at present set to
his ambition: Such a barrier was also raised as seemed
for ever impregnable. And though his own offer was
made the foundation of the treaty, he had prescribed so
short a time for the acceptance of that offer, that he
still expected, from the delays and reluctance of Spain,
to find some opportunity of eluding it. The court of
Madrid showed equal displeasure. To be obliged to
give up any part of the Spanish provinces, in lieu of
claims, so apparently unjust, and these urged with such
violence and haughtiness, inspired the highest disgust.
Often did they threaten to abandon entirely the Low
Countries rather than submit to so cruel a mortifica∣tion
and they endeavoured, by this menace, to terrify
the mediating powers into more vigorous measures for
their support. But Temple and de Wit were better
acquainted with the views and interests of Spain. They
knew, that she must still retain the Low Countries, as
a bond of connexion with the other European powers,
who alone, if her young monarch should happen to die
without issue, could ensure her independency against
the pretensions of France. They still urged, therefore,
the terms of the triple league, and threatned Spain
with war in case of refusal. The plenipotentiaries of
all the powers met at Aix-la-Chapelle. Temple was
minister for England; Van Beuninghen for Holland;
D'Hona for Sweden.</P>
<P>SPAIN at last, pressed on all hands, accepted of the
alternative offered: but in her very compliance, she
gave strong symptoms of ill∣humour and discontent. It
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been apparent, that the Hollanders, entirely neg∣lecting
<PB N="447" REF="541"/>
the honour of the Spanish monarchy, had been
anxious only for their own security; and, provided
they could remove Lewis to a distance from their fron∣tiers,
were more indifferent what progress he made in
all other places. Sensible of these views, the Queen∣regent
of Spain resolved still to keep them in an anxiety,
which might for the future be the foundation of an
union more intimate than they were willing at present

concerted plan of the French King, had been conquer∣ed,
in fifteen days, during a rigorous season, and in the
midst of winter. She chose therefore to recover this
province, and to abandon all the towns conquered in
Flanders during the last campaign. By this means,
Lewis extended his garrisons into the heart of the Low
Countries; and a very feeble barrier remained to the
Spanish provinces.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding the advantages of his situation,
the French monarch could entertain small hopes of ever
extending his conquests on that quarter, which lay the
most exposed to his ambition, and where his acquisi∣tions
were of most importance. The triple league gua∣ranteed
the remaining provinces to Spain; and the Em∣peror
and other powers of Germany, whose interests
seemed to be strongly concerned, were invited to enter
into the same consederacy. Spain herself having about
this time, under the mediation of Charles, made peace
on equal terms with Portugal, might be expected to
exert more vigour in opposition to her haughty and
triumphant rival. The mighty satisfaction, expressed
in England, on account of the councils now embraced
by the court, promised the hearty concurrence of par∣liament
in every measure, which could be proposed for
opposition to the grandeur of France. And thus all
Europe seemed to repose herself with security under the
wings of that powerful confederacy, which had so hap∣pily
<PB N="448" REF="542"/>
been formed for her protection. It is now time to
give some account of the state of affairs in Scotland
and in Ireland.</P>
<P>THE Scots nation, though they had never been sub∣jects
to the arbitrary power of their prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> had but very
imperfect notions of law and liberty; and scarce in any
age had they ever enjoyed an administration, which had
confined itself within the proper boundaries. By their
final union alone with England, their once hated anta∣gonist,
they have happily attained the experience of a
government perfectly regular, and exempt from all vio∣lence
and injustice. Charles, from his aversion to busi∣ness,
had entrusted the affairs of that country to his
ministers, particularly Middleton; and these could not
forbear making very extraordinary stretches of autho∣rity</P>
<P>THERE had been intercepted a letter, wrote by Lorne
to Lord Duffus, in which, a little too plainly, but very
truly, he complained, that his enemies had endeavoured
by salshood to prepossess the King against him. But he
said, that he had now discovered them, and had defeated
them, and had gained the person, meaning the Earl of
Clarendon, upon whom the chief of them depended.
This letter was produced before the parliament; and
Lorne was tried upon an old, tyrannical, absurd law of
<HI>Leasing-making;</HI> by which it was rendered criminal to
belie the subjects to the King, or create in him an ill
opinion of them. He was condemned to die: But
Charles was much displeased with the sentence, and
granted him a pardon<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 149.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was carried in parliament, that twelve persons,
without crime, witness, trial, or accuser, should be de∣clared
incapable of all trust or office; and to render this
injustice more egregious, it was agreed, that these per∣sons
<PB N="449" REF="543"/>
should be named by ballot: A method of voting,
which several republics had adopted at elections, in or∣der
to prevent faction and intrigue; but which could
serve only as a cover to malice and iniquity, in the in∣flicting
of punishments. Lauderdale, Crawford, and
Sir Robert Murray, among others, were incapacitated:
But the King, who disapproved of this injustice, re∣fused
his assent<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN act was passed against all persons, who should
move the King for restoring the children of those at∣tainted
by parliament; an unheard-of restraint on ap∣plications
for grace and mercy. No penalty was affixed;
but the act was but the more violent and tyrannical on
that account. The court-lawyers had established it as
a maxim, that the assigning a punishment was a limita∣tion
of the crown: Whereas a law, forbidding any
thing, though without a penalty, made the offenders
criminal. And in that cafe, they determined, that the
punishment was arbitrary; only that it could not ex∣tend
to life. Middleton as commissioner passed this
act; though he had no instructions for that purpose.</P>
<P>AN act of indemnity passed; but at the same time it
was voted, that all those who had offended during the late
disorders, should be subjected to fines; and a committee
of parliament was appointed for imposing them. These
proceeded without any regard to some equitable rules,
which the King had prescribed to them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 147.</NOTE>. The most
obnoxious compounded secretly. No consideration was
had, either of men's estates, or of the degrees of their
guilt: No proofs were produced: Enquiries were not
so much as made: But as fast as information was given
in against any man, he was marked down for a parti∣cular
fine: And all was transacted in a secret com∣mittee.
When the list was read in parliament, excep∣tions
<PB N="450" REF="544"/>
were made to many: Some had been under age
during the civil wars; some had been abroad. But it
was still replied, that a proper time would come, when
every man should be heard in his own defence. The
only intention, it was said, of setting the fine was, that
such persons should have no benefit by the act of indem∣nity,
unless they paid the sum demanded: Every one
that chose to stand upon his innocence, and renounce
the benefit of the indemnity, might do it as his peril.
It was well known, that no one would dare so far to set
at defiance so arbitrary an administration. The King
wrote to the council, ordering them to supersede the
levying those fines: But Middleton found means,
during some time, to elude those orders<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 201.</NOTE>. And at last,
the King obliged his ministers to compound for half
the sums, which had been imposed. In all these trans∣actions,
and in most others, which passed during the
present reign, we still find the moderating hand of the
King, interposed to protect the Scots from the oppres∣sions,
which their own countrymen, employed in the
ministry, were desirous of exercising over them.</P>
<P>BUT the chief circumstance, whence were derived all
the subsequent tyranny and disorders in Scotland, was
the rigorous execution of the laws for the establishment
of episcopacy, to which a great part of the nation had
entertained the most unsurmountable aversion. The
right of patrons had for some years been abolished; and
the power of electing ministers had been vested in the
kirk-session, and lay-elders. It was now enacted, that
all incumbents, who had been admitted upon this title,
should receive a presentation from the patron, and
should be instituted anew by the bishop, under the pe∣nalty
of deprivation. The more rigid presbyterians con∣certed measures among themselves, and refused obe∣dience:
<PB N="451" REF="545"/>
They imagined, that their number would protect
them. Three hundred and fifty parishes, above a
third of the kingdom, were at once declared vacant.
The western counties chiefly were obstinate in this par∣ticular.
New ministers were sought for all over the
kingdom; and no one was so ignorant or vicious as to
be rejected. The people, who loved extremely and
respected their former teachers; men remarkable for the
severity of their manners, and their fervor in preach∣ing;
were inflamed against these intruders, who had
obtained their livings under such invidious circum∣stances,
and who took no care, by the regularity of
their manners, to soften the prejudices contracted
against them. Even most of those, who retained their
livings by compliance, fell under the imputation of hy∣pocrisy,
either by their shewing a disgust to the new
model of ecclesiastical government, which they had ac∣knowleged;
or on the other hand, by declaring, that
their former adherence to presbytery and the covenant
had been the result of violence and necessity. And as
Middleton and the new ministry indulged themselves in
great riot and disorder, to which the nation had been
little accustomed, an opinion universally prevailed, that
any form of religion, offered by such hands, must be
profane and impious.</P>
<P>THE people, notwithstanding their discontents, were
resolved to give no handle against them, by the least
symptom of mutiny or sedition: But this submissive dis∣position
instead of procuring a mitigation of the ri∣gours,
was made use of as an argument for continuing
the same measures, which by their vigour had enforced
so prompt an obedience. The King, however, was
disgusted with the violence of Middleton<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 202.</NOTE>; and he
made Rothes Commissioner in his place. This noble∣man
<PB N="452" REF="546"/>
was already President of the Council; and soon
after was made Lord Keeper and Treasurer. Lauderdale
still continued Secretary of State, and commonly resided
at London.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS remained in a peaceable situation, till the se∣vere
law was made in England against conventicles<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1664.</NOTE>.
The Scots parliament imitated that violence, by passing a
like act. A kind of high-commission court was appointed,
for executing this rigorous law, and for the direction of
ecclesiastical affairs. But even this court, illegal as it
might be deemed, was much preferable to the method
next adopted. Military force was let loose by the coun∣cil.
Wherever the people had generally forsaken their
churches, the guards were quartered through the coun∣try.
Sir James Turner commanded them, a man whose
natural ferocity of temper was often inflamed by the
use of strong liquors. He went about the country, and
received from the ministers lists of those who absented
themselves from church, or were supposed to frequent
conventicles. Without any proof or legal conviction,
he demanded a fine from them, and quartered soldiers
on the supposed delinquents till he received payment.
As an insurrection was dreaded during the Dutch war,
new forces were levied, and intrusted to the command
of Dalzeil and Drummond; two officers, who had served
the King during the civil wars, and had afterwards re∣tired
to Muscovy, where they had increased the native
cruelty of their disposition. A full career was given to
their tyranny by the Scots ministry. Representations
were made to the King against these enormities. He
seemed touched with the state of the country; and be∣sides
giving orders, that the ecclesiastical commission
should be discontinued, he signified his opinion, that
another way of proceeding was necessary to his ser∣vice<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 213.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="547"/>
THIS lenity of the King's came too late to remedy
the disorders. The people, inflamed with bigotry, and
irritated by ill usage, rose in arms. They were instigated
by Guthry, Semple, and other preachers. They sur∣prised
Turner in Dumfries, and resolved to have put
him to death; but finding, that his orders, which fell
into their hands, were more violent than his execution
of them, they spared his life. At Laneric, after many
prayers, they renewed the covenant, and set out their
manifesto; where they professed all submission to the
King: They desired only the restoration of presbytery and
of their former ministers. As many gentlemen of their
party had been confined on suspicion; Wallace and
Learmont, two officers, who had served, but in no
high rank, were entrusted with the command. Their
force never exceeded two thousand men; and though
the whole country bore them great favour, men's spirits
were so subdued, that the rebels could expect no farther
accession of numbers. Dalziel took the field to op∣pose
their progress. Their number was now diminished
to 800; and these, having advanced near Edinburgh,
attempted to find their way back into the west by Pent∣land
Hills. They were attacked by the King's forces<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">28th of November, 1666.</NOTE>.
Finding that they could not escape, they stopped their
march. Their ministers endeavoured to infuse courage
into them. After finging some psalms, they turned on
the enemy; and being assisted by the advantage of the
ground, they received the first charge very resolutely.
But that was all the action: Immediately, they lost or∣der,
and fled for their lives. About forty were killed on
the spot, and a hundred and thirty taken prisoners.
The rest, favoured by the night, and by the weariness,
and even by the pity of the King's troops, made their
escape.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="548"/>
THE oppressions which these people had suffered, the
delusions under which they laboured, and their inoffen∣sive
behaviour during the insurrection, made them the
objects of compassion: Yet were the King's ministers,
particularly Sharpe, resolute to take severe vengeance.
Ten were hanged on one gibbet at Edinburgh: Thirty∣five
before their own doors in different places. These
criminals might all have saved their lives, if they would
have renounced the covenant. The executions were
going on, when the King put a stop to them. He said,
that blood enough had already been shed; and he wrote
a letter, in which he ordered, that such of the pri∣soners,
as should simply promise to obey the laws for
the future, should be set at liberty, and that the incor∣rigible
should be sent to the plantations<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 237.</NOTE>. This letter
was brought by Burnet, Archbishop of Glasgow; but
not being immediately delivered to the council by
Sharpe, the President<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Wodrow's History, vol. i. p. 255.</NOTE>, one Maccail, had in the in∣terval
been put to the torture, under which he expir∣ed.
He seemed to die in a triumph of joy. “Fare∣wel
sun, moon, and stars; sarewel world and time;
farewel weak and frail body: Welcome eternity,
welcome angels and saints, welcome Saviour of the
world, and welcome God, the judge of all!” Such
were his last words: And these animated speeches he
uttered with a voice and manner, which struck all the
bystanders with astonishment.</P>
<P>THE settlement of Ireland after the restoration was a
work of much greater difficulty than that of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Ireland.</NOTE>
or of Scotland. Not only the power, during the
former usurpations, had there been vested in the King's
enemies: The whole property, in a manner, of the
kingdom had also been changed; and it became neces∣sary
to redress, but with as little violence as possible,
<PB N="455" REF="549"/>
many grievous hardships and iniquities, which were
there complained of.</P>
<P>THE Irish catholics had in 1648 concluded a treaty
with Ormond, the King's lieutenant; in which they
had stipulated pardon for their past rebellion, and had
engaged under certain conditions to assist the royal
cause: And though the violence of the priests and the
bigotry of the people had prevented, in a great mea∣sure,
the execution of this treaty; yet were there many,
who, having strictly, at the hazard of their lives, ad∣hered
to it, seemed on that account well entitled to reap
the fruits of their loyalty. Cromwel, having without
distinction expelled all the native Irish from the three
provinces of Munster, Leinster, and Ulster, had con∣fined
them to Connaught and the county of Clare; and
among those who had thus been forfeited, were many
whose innocence was altogether unquestionable. Seve∣ral
protestants likewise, and Ormond among the rest,
had all along opposed the Irish rebellion, yet having af∣terwards
embraced the King's cause against the parli∣ment,
they were all of them forfeited by the Protector.
And there were many officers, who had, from the com∣mencement
of the insurrection, served in Ireland, and
who, because they would not desert the King, had been
refused all their arrears by the English Common∣wealth.</P>
<P>To all these unhappy sufferers some justice seemed to
be due: But the difficulty was to find the means of re∣dressing
such great and extensive iniquities. Almost all
the valuable parts of Ireland had been measured out and
divided, either to the adventurers, who had lent money
to the parliament for the suppression of the Irish rebel∣lion,
or to the soldiers, who had received land in lieu
of their arrears. These could not be dispossessed, be∣cause
they were the most powerful and only armed part
<PB N="456" REF="550"/>
of Ireland; because it was requisite to favour them, in or∣der
to support the English and protestant interest in that
kingdom; and because they had generally, with a seeming
zeal and alacrity, concurred in the King's restoration.
The King, therefore, issued a proclamation; in which
he promised to maintain their settlement, and at the
same time engaged to give redress to the innocent suf∣ferers.
There was a large quantity of land as yet un∣divided
in Ireland; and from this and some other funds,
it was thought possible for the King to fulfil both these
engagements.</P>
<P>A COURT OF CLAIMS was erected, consisting altoge∣ther
of English commissioners, who had no connexion
with, any of the parties, into which Ireland was divided.
Before these, were laid four thousand claims of persons
desiring restitution on account of their innocence; and
the commissioners had found leisure to examine only six
hundred. It already appeared, that, if all these were to
be restored, the funds, whence the adventurers and sol∣diers
must get reprizals, would fall extremely short of
giving them any tolerable satisfaction. A great alarm
and anxiety seized all ranks of men: The hopes and
fears of every party were excited: These eagerly grasped
at recovering their paternal inheritance: Those were
resolute to maintain their new acquisitions.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Ormond was created Lord-Lieutenant,
being the only person, whose prudence and justice could
compose such jarring interests. A parliament was as∣sembled
at Dublin; and as the Lower House was al∣most
entirely chosen by the soldiers and adventurers,
who still kept possession, it was extremely favourable to
that interest. The House of Peers showed greater im∣partiality.</P>
<P>AN insurrection was projected, together with a sur∣prizal
of the castle of Dublin, by some of the disbanded
<PB N="457" REF="551"/>
soldiers; but this design was happily defeated by the vi∣gilance
of Ormond. Some of the criminals were pu∣nished.
Blood, the most desperate of them, escaped
into England.</P>
<P>BUT affairs could not long remain in the confusion
and uncertainty, in which they were placed. All par∣ties
seemed willing to abate somewhat of their preten∣sions,
in order to attain some stability; and Ormond
interposed his authority to that purpose. The soldiers
and adventurers agreed to relinquish a third part of their
possessions; and as they had purchased their lands at very
low prices, they had reason to think themselves ex∣tremely
favoured by this composition. All the persons,
forfeited on account of their adherence to the King,
were restored; and some of the innocent Irish. It was
a hard situation, that a man was obliged to prove him∣self
innocent, in order to recover possession of the estate,
which he and his ancestor had ever enjoyed: But the
hardship was augmented, by the difficult conditions an∣nexed
to this proof. If the person had ever lived in
the quarters of the rebels, he was not admitted to plead
his innocence; and he was, for that reason alone, sup∣posed
to have been a rebel. The enormous guilt of the
Irish nation made men overlook the more willingly any
iniquity, which might fall on individuals; and it was
considered, that though it be always the interest of all
good government to prevent injustice, it is not always
possible to remedy it, after it has had a long course, and
has been attended with great successes.</P>
<P>IRELAND began to attain a state of some composure,
when it was disturbed by a very violent act, passed by
the English parliament, which prohibited the impor∣tation
of Irish cattle into England<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In 1666.</NOTE>. Ormond remon∣strated
strongly against this law. He said, that the pre∣sent
<PB N="458" REF="552"/>
trade, carried on between England and Ireland,
was extremely to the advantage of the former kingdom,
which received only provisions, or rude materials, and
sent back in return every species of manufacture: That
if the cattle of Ireland were prohibited, the inhabitants
of that island had no other commodity by which they
could pay England for their importations, and must
have recourse to other nations for a supply: That the
industrious inhabitants of England, if deprived of Irish
provisions, which made living cheap, would be obliged
to augment the price of labour, and thereby render
their manufactures too dear to be exported to foreign
markets: That the lazy inhabitants of Ireland, finding
provisions fall almost to nothing, would never be in∣duced
to labour, but would perpetuate to all genera∣tions
their native sloth and barbarism: That by cutting
off almost entirely the trade between the kingdoms, all
the natural bands of union were dissolved, and nothing
remained to keep the Irish in their duty but force and
violence: And that by reducing that kingdom to ex∣treme
poverty, it would be even rendered incapable of
maintaining that military power, by which, during its
well grounded discontents, it must necessarily be re∣tained
in subjection.</P>
<P>THE King was so convinced of the justness of these
reasons, that he used all his interest to oppose the bill;
and he openly declared, that he could not give his as∣sent
to it with a safe conscience. But the Commons
were resolute in their purpose. Some of the rents of
England had fallen of late years, which had been as∣cribed
entirely to the importation of Irish cattle: Seves∣ral
intrigues had contributed to inflame that prejudice
particularly those of Buckingham and Ashley, who were
desirous of giving Ormond disturbance in his govern
ment: And the spirit of tyranny, of which nations an
as susceptible as individuals, had animated the English
<PB N="459" REF="553"/>
extremely to exert their superiority over their dependant
state. No affair could be conducted with greater vio∣lence
than this was by the Commons. They even
went so sar in the preamble of the bill as to declare
the importation of Irish cattle to be a <HI>nuisance.</HI>
By this
expression, they gave scope to their passion, and at the
same time barred the King's prerogative, by which he
might think himself entitled to dispense with a law, so
full of injustice and bad policy. The Lords expunged
the word; but as the King was sensible, that no supply
would be given by the Commons, unless they were gra∣tified
in all their prejudices, he was obliged both to em∣ploy
his interest with the Peers for making the bill
pass, and to give the royal assent to it. He could not,
however, forbear expressing his displeasure at the jea∣lousy
entertained against him, and at the intention,
which the Commons discovered of retrenching his pre∣rogative.</P>
<P>THIS law brought great distress for some time upon
Ireland; but it has occasioned their applying with
greater industry to manufactures, and has proved in the
issue beneficial to that kingdom.</P>

<P>SINCE the restoration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXV.</NOTE> England was in a condi∣tion, which had never been experienced in any
former period of her government, and which seemed
the only one, that could fully ensure her happiness and
her liberty: The King was in continual want of supply
from the parliament; and he seemed willing to accom∣modate
himself to that dependent situation. Instead of
reviving those claims of prerogative, so strenuously in∣sisted
on by his father and grandfather, he had strictly
confined himself within the limits of law, and had
courted, by every art of popularity, the affections of his
subjects. Even the severities, however blameable, which
he had been forced to exercise against nonconformists,
are to be considered as expedients, by which he strove
to ingratiate himself with that party, which predomi∣nated
<PB N="461" REF="555"/>
in parliament. But notwithstanding these pro∣mising
appearances, there were many circumstances,
which kept the government from resting steddily on that
bottom, on which it was placed. The crown having
lost almost all its antient demesnes, relied entirely on
voluntary grants of the people; and the Commons, not
fully accustomed to this new situation, were not dispos∣ed
to supply with sufficient liberality the necessities of
the crown. They imitated too strictly the example of
their predecessors in a rigid frugality of public money;
and neither sufficiently considered the indigent situation
of the Prince, nor the general state of Europe, where
every nation, by its increase both of magnificence and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce, had made great additions to all public expences.
Some considerable sums, indeed, were bestowed on
Charles, and the patriots of that age, tenacious of an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient
maxims, loudly upbraided the Commons with pro∣digality:
But if we may judge by the example of a later
period, when the government has become more regular,
and the harmony of its parts has been more happily ad∣justed,
the parliaments of this reign seem rather to have
merited a contrary reproach.</P>
<P>THE natural consequence of the poverty of the
crown was, besides feeble irregular transactions in
foreign affairs, a continual uncertainty in its domestic
administration. No one could answer with any toler∣able
assurance for the measures of the House of Com∣mons.
Few of the members were attached to the court
by any other band than that of inclination. Royalists
indeed in their principles, but unexperienced in busi∣ness,
they lay exposed to every rumour or insinuation;
and were driven by momentary gusts or currents, no
less than the populace themselves. Even the attempts
made to gain an ascendant over them, by offices, and,
as 'tis believed, by bribes and pensions, were apt to ope∣rate
in a manner contrary to what was intended by
<PB N="462" REF="556"/>
the ministers. The novelty of the practice conveye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a general, and indeed a just, alarm; while at the sam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
time, the poverty of the crown rendered this influenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
very limited and precarious.</P>
<P>THE character of Charles was ill fitted to remedy
those defects in the constitution. He acted in the ad∣ministration
of public affairs, as if government were a
pastime, rather than a serious occupation; and by the
uncertainty of his conduct, he lost that authority, which
could alone bestow constancy on the fluctuating resolu∣tions
of the parliament. His expences too, which al∣ways
exceeded the proper bounds, were directed more
by inclination than by policy; and while they rendered
him continually dependant on the parliament, they were
not calculated so as fully to satisfy either the interested
or disinterested part of that assembly.</P>
<P>THE parliament met after a long adjournment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of Fe∣bruary. A parliament.</NOTE> and
the King promised himself every thing from the at∣tachment
of the Commons. All his late measures had
been calculated to acquire the good will of his people;
and above all, the triple league, it was hoped, would
be able to efface all the impressions left by the unhappy
conclusion of the Dutch war. But a new attempt
made by the court, and a very laudable one too, lost
him, for a time, the effect of all these endeavours.
Buckingham, who was in great favour with the King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and carried on many intrigues among the Commons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had also endeavoured to support connexions with the
nonconformists; and he now formed a scheme, toge∣ther
with the Lord Keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, and
Sir Mathew Hale, Chief Justice, two worthy patriots, to
put an end to those severities, under which these religio∣nists
had so long laboured. It was proposed to reconcil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the presbyterians by a comprehension, and to grant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
toleration to the independants and other sectaries<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Favour seems not, by this scheme, as by others em∣braced
<PB N="463" REF="557"/>
during the present reign, to have been intended
the catholics: Yet were the zealous Commons so dis∣gusted,
that they could not be prevailed on even to
give the King thanks for the triple league, however
laudable that measure was then, and has ever since been
esteemed. They immediately voted an address for a
proclamation against conventicles. Their request was
complied with; but as the King still dropped some
hints of his desire to reconcile his protestant subjects,
the Commons passed a very unusual vote, that no man
should bring into the House any bill of that nature.
The King in vain re-iterated his sollicitations for sup∣ply,
represented the necessity of equipping a fleet, and
even offered, that the money which they should grant,
should be collected and issued for that purpose by commis∣sioners
appointed by the House. Instead of compliance,
the Commons voted an enquiry into all the miscarriages
during the late war; the slackening <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail after the Duke's
victory from false orders delivered by Brounker, the
miscarriage at Berghen, the division of the fleet under
Prince Rupert and Albemarle, the disgrace at Chatham.
Brounker was expelled the House, and ordered to be
impeached. Commissioner Pet, who had neglected or∣ders
for the security of Chatham, met with the same
fate. These impeachments were never prosecuted. The
House at last, having been indulged in all their preju∣dices,
were prevailed with to vote the King three hun∣dred
and ten thousand pounds, by an imposition on
wine and other liquors; after which they were ad∣journed.</P>
<P>Public business, besides being retarded by the disgust of
the Commons against the tolerating maxims of the court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of May.</NOTE>
received obstructions this session from a quarrel between
the two Houses. Skinner, a rich merchant in Lon∣don,
having met with some injuries from the East India
Company, laid the matter by petition before the House
<PB N="464" REF="558"/>
of Lords, by whom he was relieved in costs and dam∣ages
to the amount of five thousand pounds. The
Commons voted, that the Lords, in taking cognizance
of this affair, originally, without any appeal from in∣ferior
courts, had acted in a manner not agreeable to the
laws of the land, and tending to deprive the subject of
the right, ease, and benefit, due to him by these laws;
and that Skinner, in prosecuting the suit, had infringed
the privileges of the Commons: For which offence,
they ordered him to be taken into the custody of the
Serjeant at Arms. Some conferences ensued between
the Houses; where the Lords were tenacious of their
right of judicature, and maintained, that the method,
in which they had exercised it was quite regular. The
Commons rose into a great serment; and went so far as
to vote, that “whoever should be aiding or assisting in
putting in execution the order or sentence of the
House of Lords, in the case of Skinner against the
East India Company, shall be deemed a betrayer of
the rights and liberties of the Commons of England,
and an infringer of the privileges of the House of
Commons.” They rightly judged, that it would not
be easy, after this vote, to find any one, who would
venture on their indignation. The proceedings indeed
of the Lords seem in this case to have been unusual and
without precedent.</P>
<P>THE King's necessities obliged him again to assemble
the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1669.</NOTE> who showed some disposition to relieve
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Oc-</NOTE> The price, however, which he must pay for this
indulgence, was his yielding to laws against conventicles.
His compliasance in this particular contributed more to
gain the Commons, than all the pompous pretences of
supporting the triple alliance, that popular measure, by
which he expected to make such advantage. The quar∣rel
between the two Houses was revived; and as the
<PB N="465" REF="559"/>
Commons had voted only four hundred thousand pounds,
with which the King was not satisfied, he thought pro∣per,
before they had carried their vote into a law, to
prorogue them. The only business finished this short<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of De∣cember,</NOTE>
session was the receiving the report of the committee
appointed for examining the public accounts. On the
first inspection of this report, there appears a vast sum,
no less than a million and a half, unaccounted for; and
the natural inference is, that the King had very much
abused the trust reposed in him by parliament. But a
more accurate inspection of particulars serves, in a great
measure, to remove this imputation. The King indeed
went so far as to tell the parliament from the throne,
“That he had fully informed himself of that matter,
and did affirm, that no part of those monies, which
they had given him, had been diverted to other uses,
but on the contrary, besides all those supplies, a very
great sum had been raised out of his standing reve∣nue
and credit, and a very great debt contracted;
and all for the war.” Though artificial pretences
have often been employed by Kings in their speeches to
parliament, and by none more than Charles, it is some∣what
difficult to suspect him of a direct lie and falshood.
He must have had some reasons, and perhaps not un∣plausible
ones, for this affirmation, of which all his
hearers, as they had the accounts lying before them,
were at that time very competent judges<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The abstract of the report of the Brook-house committee (so that com∣mittee was called) was first published by Mr. Ralph, vol. i. p. 177, from Lord Hallifax's Collections, to which I refer. If we peruse their apology, which we find in the subsequent page of the same author, we shall find, that they acted with some malignity towards the King. They would take notice of no services performed before the 1st of September, 1664. But all the King's preparations preceded that date, and, as Chancellor Clarendon told the parliament, amounted to eight hundred thousand pounds; and the computa∣tion is very probable. This sum, therefore, must be added. The com∣mittee likewise charged seven hundred thousand pounds to the King on ac∣count of the winter and summer guards, saved during two years and ten months that the war lasted. But this seems inquitous. For though that was an usual burthen on the revenue, which was then saved; would not the dimi∣nution of the customs during the war be an equivalent to it? Besides, near three hundred and forty thousand pounds are charged for prize-money, which perhaps the King thought he ought not to account for. These sums exceed the million and a half.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="560"/>
THE method which all parliaments had hitherto fol∣lowed,
was to vote a particular sum for the supply,
without any distinction or appropriation for particular ser∣vices.
So long as the demands of the crown were only
small and casual, no great inconveniencies arose from
this practice. But as all the measures of government
were now changed, it must be confessed, that, if the
King made a just application of public money, this in∣accurate
method of proceeding, by exposing him to sus∣picions,
was very prejudicial to him. If he was inclined
to act otherwise, it was equally hurtful to the people.
For these reasons, a contrary practice, during all the
late reigns, has constantly been followed by the Com∣mons.</P>
<P>WHEN the parliament met after the prorogation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> they
entered anew upon the business of the supply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> and
granted the King an additional duty, during eight
years, of twelve pounds on each tun of Spanish wine,
eight on each tun of French. A law was also passed
empowering him to sell the fee farm rents; the last re∣mains
of the demesnes by which the antient Kings of
England had been supported. By this expedient he
obtained some supply for his present necessities, but le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
the crown, if possible, still more dependant than before.
How much money might be raised by these sales is un∣certain;
but it could not be near one million eight hun∣dred
thousand pounds, the sum assigned by some writers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mrs Carte, in his Vindication of the Answer to the Bystander, p. 99, says, that the sale of the fee farm rents would not yield above one hun∣dred thousand pounds; and his reasons appear well founded.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="561"/>
THE act against conventicles passed, and received the
royal assent. It bears the appearance of mitigating the
former persecuting laws; but if we may judge by the
spirit, which had broke out almost every session during
this parliament, it was not intended as any favour to
the nonconformists. 'Twas probably found by expe∣rience,
that laws over rigid and severe could not be
executed. By this act the hearer in a conventicle, (that
is, in a dissenting assembly, where more than five were
present, besides the family) was fined five shillings for the
first offence, ten for the second; the preacher twenty
pounds for the first offence; forty for the second. The
person, in whose house the conventicle met, forfeited a like
sum with the preacher. One clause is very remarkable;
that, if any dispute should arise with regard to the in∣terpretation
of any part of the act, the Judges should
always explain the doubt in the sense least favourable to
conventicles, it being the intention of the parliament
entirely to suppress them. Such was the zeal of the
Commons, that they violated the plainest and most esta∣blished
maxims of civil policy, which require, that, in
all criminal prosecutions, favour should always be given
to the prisoner.</P>
<P>THE affair of Skinner still remained a ground of
quarrel between the two Houses; but the King pre∣vailed
with the Peers to accept of the expedient pro∣posed
by the Commons, that a general razure should be
made of all the transactions with regard to that disput∣ed
question.</P>
<P>SOME attempts were made by the King to effectuate
a union between England and Scotland: But they were
too feeble to remove all the difficulties, which obstruct∣ed
that useful and important undertaking. Commissio∣ners
were appointed to meet, in order to regulate the
conditions: But the design, chiefly by the intrigues of
Lauderdale, soon after came to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="562"/>
THE KING, about this time, began frequently to at∣tend
the debates of the House of Peers. He said, that they
amused him, and that he found them no less entertain∣ing
than a play. But deeper designs were suspected.
As he seemed to interest himself extremely in the cause
of Lord Roos, who had obtained a divorce from his
wife on the accusation of adultery, and applied to par∣liament
for leave to marry again; people imagined,
that Charles proposed to make a precedent of the case,
and that some other pretence would be found for getting
rid of the Queen. Many proposals to this purpose, it
is said, were made him by Buckingham: But the King,
however little scrupulous in some respects, was incap∣able
of any action harsh or barbarous; and he always
rejected with horror all schemes of this nature. A sus∣picion
however of such intentions, it was observed,
had, at this time, begot a coldness between the two
royal brothers.</P>
<P>WE now come to a period, when the King's coun∣cils,
which had hitherto, in the main, been good, tho'
negligent and fluctuating, became, during some time,
remarkably bad, or even criminal; and breeding in∣curable
jealousies in all men, were followed by such
consequences as had almost terminated in the ruin both
of Prince and people. Happily the same negligence still
attended him, and, as it had lessened the influence of
the good, it also diminished the effect of the bad mea∣sures,
which he embraced.</P>
<P>IT was remarked, that the committee of council,
established for foreign affairs, was entirely changed;
and that Prince Rupert, the Duke of Ormond, Secre∣tary
Trevor, and Lord Keeper Bridgeman, men in
whose honour the nation had great confidence, were
never called to any deliberations. The whole secret
was entrusted to five persons, Clifford, Ashley, Buck∣ingham,
<PB N="469" REF="563"/>
A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lington, Lauderdale. These men were
known by the appellation of the Cabal, a word which
the initial letters of their names happened to compose.
Never was there a more dangerous ministry in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cabal.</NOTE>
nor one more noted for pernicious councils.</P>
<P>LORD ASHLEY, soon after known by the name of
Earl of Shaftesbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cha∣racters.</NOTE> was one of the most remarkable
characters of the age, and the chief spring of all the
succeeding movements. During his early youth, he
had engaged in the late King's party; but being dis∣gusted
with some measures of Prince Maurice, he soon
deserted to the parliament. He insinuated himself into
the confidence of Cromwel; and as he had great in∣fluence
on the presbyterians, he was serviceable in sup∣porting
the authority of that usurper. He employed
the same credit to promote the restoration; and on that
account both deserved and acquired great favour with
the King. In all his changes, he still maintained the
character of never betraying those friends whom he de∣serted;
and which ever party he joined, his great ca∣pacity
and singular talents soon gained him their confi∣dence,
and enabled him to take the lead among them.
No station could satisfy his ambition, no fatigues were
insuperable to his industry. Well-acquainted with the
blind attachment of parties, he surmounted all sense of
shame: And relying on the subtilty of his contrivances,
he was not startled with enterprizes, the most hazar∣dous
and most criminal. His talents, both of public
speaking and private insinuation, shone out in an emi∣nent
degree; and amidst all his furious passions, he pos∣sessed
a found judgment of business, and still more of
men. Though fitted by nature for beginning and
pushing the greatest undertakings, he was never able
to conduct any to a happy period; and his eminent abi∣lities,
by reason of his insatiable desires, were equally
dangerous to himself, to the Prince, and to the people<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="564"/>
THE Duke of Buckingham possessed all the advant∣ages,
which a graceful person, a high rank, a splendid
fortune, and a lively wit could bestow; but by his wild
conduct, unrestrained either by prudence or principle,
he found means to render himself in the end odious and
even insignificant. The least interest could make him
abandon his honour; the smallest pleasure could seduce
him from his interest; the most frivolous caprice was
sufficient to counterballance his pleasure. By the want
of secrecy and constancy, he destroyed his character in
public life; by the contempt of order and oeconomy,
he dissipated his private fortune; by riot and debauchery,
he ruined his health; and he remained at last as inca∣pable
of doing hurt, as he had ever been little desirous
of doing good, to mankind.</P>
<P>THE Earl, soon after created Duke, of Lauderdale,
was not defective in natural, and still less in acquired,
talents; but neither was his address graceful, nor his
understanding just. His principles, or, more properly
speaking, his prejudices, were obstinate, but unable to
restrain his ambition: His ambition was still less dan∣gerous
than the tyranny and violence of his temper.
An implacable enemy, but a lukewarm friend; insolent
to his inferiors, but abject to his superiors; though in
his whole character and deportment, he was almost dia∣metrically
opposite to the King, he had the fortune,
beyond any other minister, to maintain, during the
greatest part of his reign, an ascendant over him.</P>
<P>THE talents of parliamentary eloquence and intrigue
had raised Sir Thomas Clifford; and his daring impe∣tuous
spirit gave him weight in the King's councils.
Of the whole Cabal, Arlington was the least dangerous
either by his vices or his talents. His judgment was
sound, though his capacity was but moderate; and his
intentions were good, though he wanted courage and
<PB N="471" REF="565"/>
integrity to persevere in them. Together with Temple
and Bridgeman, he had been a great promoter of the
triple league; but he threw himself with equal alacrity
into opposite measures, when he found them agreeable to
his master. Clifford and he were secretly catholics:
Shaftesbury, though addicted to astrology, was reckon∣ed
a deist: Buckingham had too little reflection to em∣brace
any steady principles: Lauderdale had long been
a bigotted and furious presbyterian; and the opinions
of that sect still kept possession of his mind, however
little they appeared in his conduct.</P>
<P>THE dark councils of the Cabal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their coun∣cils.</NOTE> though from the
first they gave anxiety to all men of reflection, were
not thoroughly known but by the event. Such seem
to have been the views, which they suggested to the
King and the Duke, and which these Princes too
greedily embraced. They said, that the parliament,
though the spirit of party, for the present, attached
them to the crown, were still more attached to those
powers and privileges, which their predecessors had
usurped from the Sovereign: That after the first flow
of kindness, they had discovered symptoms of discon∣tent;
and would be sure to turn against the King all
the authority which they yet retained, and still more
those pretensions which it was easy for them in a mo∣ment
to revive: That they not only kept the King in
dependance by means of his precarious revenue, but
had never discovered a suitable generosity, even in those
temporary supplies, which they granted him: That it
was time for the Prince to rouze himself from his le∣thargy,
and to recover that authority, which his prede∣cessors,
during so many ages, had peaceably enjoyed:
That the great error or misfortune of his father was the
not having formed any close connexion with foreign
Princes, who, on the breaking out of the rebellion,
might have found their interest in supporting him:
<PB N="472" REF="566"/>
That the present alliances, being entered into with so
many weaker potentates, who themselves stood in need
of the King's protection, could never serve to maintain,
much less augment, the royal authority: That the
French monarch alone, so generous a Prince, and by
blood so nearly allied to the King, would be found
both able and willing, if gratified in his ambition, to
defend the common cause of Kings against usurping
subjects: That a war, undertaken against Holland by
the united force of two such mighty potentates, would
prove an easy enterprize, and would serve all the pur∣poses
which were aimed at: That under pretence of that
war, it would not be difficult to levy a military force,
without which, during the prevalence of republican
principles among his subjects, the King would vainly
expect to defend his prerogative: That his naval power
might be maintained, partly by the supplies, which, on
other pretences, would previously be obtained from par∣liament;
partly by subsidies from France; partly by cap∣tures,
which might easily be made on that opulent re∣public:
That in such a situation, attempts to recover
the lost authority of the crown would be attended with
success; not would any malecontents dare to resist a
Prince, fortified by so powerful an alliance; or if they
did, they would only draw more certain ruin on them∣selves
and on their cause: And that by subduing the
States, a great step would be taken towards advancing a
reformation of the government; since it was apparent,
that that republic, by its fame and grandeur, fortified,
in his factious subjects, their attachment to what they
vainly called their civil and religious liberties.</P>
<P>THESE suggestions happened fatally to concur with
all the inclinations and prejudices of the King; his
desire of more extensive authority, his propensity to the
catholic religion, his avidity for money. He seems
likewise, from the very beginning of his reign, to have
<PB N="473" REF="567"/>
entertained great jealousy of his own subjects, and, on
that account, a desire of fortifying himself by an inti∣mate
alliance with France. So early as 1664, he had
offered the French monarch to allow him without op∣position
to conquer Flanders, provided that Prince
would engage to furnish him with ten thousand infan∣try,
and a suitable number of cavalry, in case of any
rebellion in England<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D'Estrades, 21st of July, 1667.</NOTE>. As no dangerous symptoms at
that time discovered themselves, we are left to conjec∣ture,
from this incident, what opinion Charles had
conceived of the factious disposition of his people.</P>
<P>EVEN during the time, when the triple alliance was
most zealously cultivated, the King never seems to
have been entirely cordial in those salutary measures,
but still to have cast a longing eye towards the French
alliance. Clifford, who had much of his confidence,
said imprudently, “Notwithstanding all this joy, we
must have a second war with Holland.” The acces∣sion
of the Emperor to that alliance had been refused
by England on very frivolous pretences. And many
unfriendly cavils were raised against the States with re∣gard
to Surinam and the conduct of the East India
Company. But about April 1669, the strongest symp∣toms
appeared of those fatal measures, which were after∣wards
more openly pursued.</P>
<P>DE WIT, at that time, came to Temple; and told
him, that he payed him a visit as a friend, not as a mi∣nister.
The occasion was to acquaint him with a con∣versation
which he had lately had with Puffendorf, the
Swedish agent, who had passed by the Hague in the
way from Paris to his own country. The French mi∣nisters,
Puffendorf said, had taken much pains to per∣suade
him, that the Swedes would find their account very
ill in those measures, which they had lately embraced:
That Spain would fail them in all her promises of sub∣sidies;
<PB N="474" REF="568"/>
nor would Holland alone be able to support
them: That England would certainly fail them, and
had already adopted councils directly opposite to those
which by the triple league she had bound herself to pur∣sue:
And that the resolution was not the less fixed and
certain, that the secret was as yet communicated to ve∣ry
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew either in the French or English court. When
Puffendorf seemed incredulous, Turenne showed him a
letter from Colbert de Croissy, the French minister at
London; where, after mentioning the success of his
negotiations, and the favourable disposition of the chief
ministers there, he added, “And I have at last made
them sensible of the whole extent of his Majesty's
bounty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. ii. p. 179.</NOTE>.” From this incident it appears, that the
infamous practice of selling themselves to foreign
Princes, a practice, which, notwithstanding the ma∣lignity
of the vulgar, is certainly very rare among
men in high office, had not been scrupled by Charles's
ministers.</P>
<P>BUT the King's resolutions seem never to have been
entirely fixed, till the visit which he received from his
sister, the Dutchess of Orleans. Lewis, knowing the
address and insinuation of that amiable Princess, and the
great influence which she had obtained over her brother,
had engaged her to employ all her good offices, in or∣der
to detach England from the triple league, which,
he knew, had fixed such an unsurmountable barrier to
his ambition. That he might the better cover this ne∣gotiation,
he pretended to visit his frontiers, particularly
the great works which he had undertaken at Dunkirk;
and he carried the Queen and the whole court along
with him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of May</NOTE> While he remained on the opposite shore,
the Dutchess of Orleans went over into England; and
Charles met her at Dover, where they passed ten days
together in great mirth and festivity. By her artifices
<PB N="475" REF="569"/>
and caresses, she prevailed on Charles to relinquish the
most settled maxims of honour and policy, and to fi∣nish
his engagements with Lewis for the destruction of
Holland. No particular articles seem here to have been
signed, or even agreed upon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alliance with France.</NOTE> Neither of the Princes
had the least claims on that republic; and they could
therefore regulate their pretensions only by the future
success of their arms. And as to the scheme, which
Charles is with so good reason supposed to have enter∣tained,
of employing the French power, or at least the
terror of it, for enlarging his authority at home; it
was of such a nature as must depend upon incidents,
and, for the present, it sufficed, if he conjoined his in∣terests
intimately with France, and obtained general
assurances of support, in case of any opposition or in∣surrection.</P>
<P>BUT Lewis well knew Charles's character, and the
usual fluctuation of his councils. In order to fix him in
the French interests, he resolved to bind him by the
tyes of pleasure, the only ones which with him were
irresistible; and he made him a present of a French
mistress, by whose means he hoped, for the future, to
govern him. The Dutchess of Orleans brought with
her a young lady of the name of Queroüaille, whom the
King carried to London, and soon after created Dutchess
of Portsmouth. He was extremely attached to her du∣ring
the whole course of his life; and she proved a
great means of supporting his connections with her na∣tive
country. 'Tis impossible but his quick discern∣ment
must have perceived the scope of all these artifices;
but he was too much a slave to pleasure, ever to de∣fend
himself against its present allurements.</P>
<P>The satisfaction which Charles reaped from his new
alliance, received a great check by the death of his
sister, and still more by those melancholy circumstances
<PB N="476" REF="570"/>
which attended it. Her death was sudden, after a few
days illness; and she was seized with the malady upon
drinking a glass of succory-water. Strong suspicions of
poison arose in the court of France, and spread all over
Europe; and as her husband had discovered many symp∣toms
of jealousy and discontent on account of her con∣duct,
he was universally believed to be the author of
that crime. Charles himself, during some time, was
entirely convinced of his guilt; but upon receiving the
attestation of physicians, who, on opening her body,
found no foundation for the general rumour, he was,
or pretended to be satisfied. The Duke of Orleans in∣deed
did never, in any other circumstance of his life,
betray such dispositions as might lead him to so criminal
an action; and a lady, it is said, drank the remains of
the same glass, without feeling any inconvenience. The
sudden death of Princes is commonly accompanied with
these dismal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urmises; and therefore less weight is in
this case to be laid on the suspicions of the public.</P>
<P>CHARLES, instead of breaking with France upon this
incident, took advantage of it to send over Buckingham,
under pretence of condoling with the Duke of Orleans,
but in reality to concert farther measures for the pro∣jected
war. Never ambassador received greater caresses.
The more destructive the present measures were to the
interests of England, the more natural was it for Lewis
to load with civilities, and even with favours, those
whom he could engage to promote them.</P>
<P>THE journey of Buckingham raised strong suspicions
in Holland, which every circumstance tended still farther
to confirm. Lewis made a sudden irruption into Lor∣raine;
and though he missed seizing the Duke himself,
who had no surmise of the danger, and who very nar∣rowly
escaped, he was soon able, without resistance, to
make himself master of the whole country. The French
<PB N="477" REF="571"/>
monarch was so far unhappy, that, though the most
tempting opportunities offered themselves, he had not
commonly so much as the pretence of equity and jus∣tice
to cover his ambitious measures. This acquisition
of Lorraine ought to have excited the jealousy of the
contracting powers in the triple league, as much as an
invasion of Flanders itself; yet did Charles turn a deaf
ear to all remonstrances which were made him upon
that subject.</P>
<P>BUT what tended chiefly to open the eyes of de Wit
and the States, with regard to the measures of England,
was the sudden recal of Sir William Temple. That
minister had so firmly established his character of ho∣nour
and integrity, that he was believed incapable even
of obeying his master's commands, in promoting mea∣sures
which he esteemed pernicious to his country; and
so long as he remained in employment, de Wit thought
himself assured of the fidelity of England. Charles was
so sensible of this prepossession, that he ordered Temple
to leave his family at the Hague, and pretended that
that minister would immediately return, after having
conferred with the King about some business, where his
negotiation had met with obstructions. De Wit made
the Dutch resident inform the English court, that he
would consider the recal of Temple as an express de∣claration
of a change of measures in England; and
would even know what interpretation to put upon any
delay of his return.</P>
<P>WHILE these measures were secretly in agitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of Oc∣tober. A parliament</NOTE> the
parliament met, according to adjournment. The King
made a very short speech, and left the business to be
enlarged upon by the keeper. That minister insisted
much on the King's great want of supply; the mighty
increase of the naval power of France, now triple to
what it was before the last war with Holland; the de∣cay
<PB N="478" REF="572"/>
of the English navy▪ the necessity of fitting out
next year a fleet of fifty sail; the obligations which the
King lay under by several treaties to exert himself for
the common good of christendom. Among other trea∣ties,
he mentioned the triple alliance, and the defensive
league with the states. It is certain, that Bridgeman,
though he was not admitted into the secrets of the ca∣bal,
must have observed so many grounds of suspicion,
as should have kept him from giving sanction to that
deceit, which was intended to be put upon the par∣liament.</P>
<P>THE artifice succeeded. The House of Commons,
entirely satisfied with the King's measures, voted him
considerable supplies. A land tax for a year was im∣posed
of a shilling a pound; two shillings a pound on
two thirds of the salaries of offices; fifteen shillings on
every hundred pound of bankers' money and stock; an
additional excise upon beer for six years, and certain
impositions upon law proceedings for nine years. The
parliament had never before been in a more liberal dis∣position;
and never surely was it less merited by the
councils of the King and of his ministers.</P>
<P>THE Commons passed another bill for laying a duty
on tobacco, Scots salt, glasses, and some other commo∣dities.
Against this bill the merchants of London ap∣peared
by petition before the House of Lords. The
Lords entered into their reasons, and began to make
amendments on the bill sent up by the Commons. This
attempt was highly resented by the lower house, as an
encroachment on the right, which they pretended to
possess alone, of granting money to the crown. Many
remonstrances passed between the two houses; and by
their altercations the King was obliged to prorogue the
parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1671.</NOTE> and he thereby lost the money which was
intended him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of April.</NOTE> This is the last time that the Peers have
<PB N="479" REF="573"/>
revived any pretensions of that nature. Ever since, the
privilege of the Commons, in all other places, except
the House of Peers, has passed for undisputed.</P>
<P>THERE was a private affair, which during this session
disgusted the House of Commons, and required some
pains to accommodate it. The usual method of those
who opposed the court in the money bills, was, if they
failed in the main vote, as to the extent of the supply,
to levy the money from such funds as they expected
would be unacceptable, or would prove deficient. It
was proposed to lay an imposition upon playhouses:
The courtiers objected, that the players were the King's
servants, and a part of his pleasure. Sir John Coventry,
a gentleman of the country party, asked, “whether the
King's pleasure lay among the male or the female
players?” This stroke of satire was aimed at
Charles, who, besides his mistresses of higher quality,
entertained at that time two actresses, Davis and Nell
Gwin. The King received not the raillery with that
good humour which might have been expected. It was
said, that this being the first time, when respect to Ma∣jesty
had been publicly violated, it was necessary, by
some severe chastisement, to make Coventry an example
to all who might incline to tread in his footsteps.
Sands, Obrian, and some others of the guards, were
ordered to way-lay him, and to set a mark upon him.
He defended himself with great bravery, and after
wounding several of the assailants, was with some
difficulty disarmed. They cut his nose to the bone,
in order, as they said, to teach him what respect he
owed to the King. The Commons were enflamed by
this indignity offered to one of their members, on ac∣count
of words spoke in the house. They passed a
law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coventry act</NOTE> where they made it capital to maim any person;
and they enacted, that those criminals who had assaulted
<PB N="480" REF="574"/>
Coventry, should be incapable of receiving a pardon
from the crown.</P>
<P>THERE was another private affair transacted about
this time, by which the King was as much exposed to
the imputation of a capricious lenity, as he was here
blamed for unnecessary severity. Blood, a disbanded of∣ficer
of the Protector, had been engaged in the conspi∣racy
for raising an insurrection in Ireland; and for this
crime he himself had been attainted, and some of his
accomplices capitally punished.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blood's crimes.</NOTE> The daring villain me∣ditated
a revenge upon Ormond, the Lord Lieutenant.
Having by artifice drawn off the Duke's footmen, he
attacked his coach in the night, as he drove along St.
James's street in London, and made himself master of
his person. He might here have finished the crime,
had he not meditated resinements in his vengeance:
He was resolved to hang the Duke at Tyburn; and for
that purpose bound him, and mounted him on horse∣back
behind one of his companions. They were ad∣vanced
a good way into the fields; when the Duke,
making efforts for his liberty, threw himself to the
ground, and brought down with him the assassin to
whom he was tied. They were struggling together in
the mud; when Ormond's servants, whom the alarm
had reached, came and saved him. Blood and his com∣panions,
firing their pistols in a hurry at the Duke,
rode off and saved themselves by means of the darkness.</P>
<P>BUCKINGHAM was at first, with some appearance of
reason, suspected to be the author of the attempt. His
profligate character, and his enmity against Ormond,
exposed him to this imputation. Ossory soon after came
to court, and seeing Buckingham stand by the King,
his colour rose, and he could not forbear expressing
himself to this purpose. “My Lord, I know well,
that you are at the bottom of this late attempt upon
<PB N="481" REF="575"/>
my father: but I give you warning, if by any means
he comes to a violent end, I shall not be at a loss to
know the author: I shall consider you as the assassin:
I shall treat you as such; and wherever I meet you,
I shall pistol you, though you stood behind the King's
chair; and I tell it you in his Majesty's presence,
that you may be sure I shall not fail of perform∣ance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 225.</NOTE>.” If there was here any indecorum, it was
easily excused in a generous youth, when his father's
life was exposed to danger.</P>
<P>A LITTLE after, Blood formed a design of carrying
off the crown and regalia from the tower; a design, to
which he was prompted, as well by the surprising bold∣ness
of the enterprize, as by the views of profit. He
was very near succeeding. He had bound and wounded
Edwards, the keeper of the jewel-office, and had got
out of the Tower with his prey, but was overtaken and
seized, with some of his associates. One of them was
known to have been concerned in the attempt upon
Ormond; and Blood was immediately concluded to be
the ringleader. When asked, he frankly avowed the
enterprize; but refused to tell his accomplices. “The
fear of death,” he said, “would never engage him,
either to deny a guilt, or betray a friend.” All these
extraordinary circumstances made him the general sub∣ject
of conversation; and the King was moved by an
idle curiosity to see and speak with a person so noted for
his courage and his crimes. Blood might now esteem
himself secure of pardon, and he wanted not address to
improve the opportunity. He told Charles, that he had
been engaged, with others, in a design to kill him with
a carabine above Battersea, where his Majesty often
went to bathe: That the cause of this resolution was
the severity exercised over the consciences of the godly,
<PB N="482" REF="576"/>
in restraining the liberty of their religious assemblies:
That when he had taken his stand among the reeds,
full of these bloody resolutions, he found his heart
checked with an awe of Majesty; and not only relented
himself, but diverted his associates from their purpose:
That he had long ago brought himself to an entire in∣difference
about life, which he now gave for lost; yet
could he not forbear warning the King of the danger
which might attend his execution: That his associates
had bound themselves together by the strictest oaths to
revenge the death of any of their confederacy: And
that no precaution nor power could secure any one
from the effects of their desperate resolutions.</P>
<P>WHETHER these considerations excited fear or ad∣miration
in the King, they confirmed his resolution of
granting a pardon to Blood; but he thought it a re∣quisite
point of decency first to obtain the Duke of Or∣mond's
consent. Arlington came to Ormond in the
King's name, and desired that he would not prosecute
Blood, for reasons which he was commanded to give
him. The Duke gallantly replied, that his Majesty's
commands were the only reason, that could be given,
and being sufficient, he might therefore spare the rest.
Charles carried his kindness to Blood still farther: He
granted him an estate of five hundred pounds a year in
Ireland; he encouraged his attendance about his per∣son;
he showed him great countenance, and many
applied to him for promoting their pretensions at court.
And while old Edwards, who had bravely ventured his
life, and had been wounded, in defending the crown
and regalia, was forgotten and neglected, this man,
who deserved only to be stared at, and detested as a
monster, became a kind of favourite.</P>
<P>ERRORS of this nature in private life, have often as
bad an influence as miscarriages, in which the public is
<PB N="483" REF="577"/>
more immediately concerned. Another incident hap∣pened
this year, which infused a very general displea∣sure,
and still greater apprehensions, into all men. The
Dutchess of York died, and in her last sickness, she
made open profession of the Romish religion, and
finished her life in that communion. This put an end
to that thin disguise, which the Duke had hitherto
worne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke de∣clares him∣self catholic.</NOTE> and he now openly declared his attachment to
the church of Rome. Unaccountable terrors of popery,
ever since the accession of the house of Stuart, had pre∣vailed
throughout the nation; but these had formerly
been found so groundless, and had been employed to so
many bad purposes, that surmises of this nature were
likely to meet with the less credit from all men of
sense; and nothing but the Duke's imprudent bigotry
could have convinced the whole nation of his conversion.
Popery, which had hitherto been only a hideous spectre,
was now become a real ground of terror, being openly
and zealously embraced by the heir apparent to the
crown, a Prince of industry and enterprize; while the
King himself was not entirely free from like suspi∣cions.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that the new alliance of France in∣spired
the Duke with courage to make open profession
of his religion, and rendered him more careless of the
affections and esteem of the English. This alliance be∣came
every day more visible to all the world. Temple
was declared to be no longer Ambassador to the States;
and Downing, whom the Dutch regarded as the invete∣rate
enemy of their republic, was sent over in his place.
A ground of quarrel was sought by means of a yacht,
dispatched for Lady Temple. The Captain sailed thro'
the Dutch fleet, which lay on their own coasts; and he
had orders to make them strike, to fire on them, and to
persevere till they should return his fire. The Dutch
Admiral, Van Ghent, surprised at this bravado, came
<PB N="484" REF="578"/>
on board the yacht, and expressed his willingness to
pay respect to the British flag, according to antient
practice: But that a fleet on their own coasts should
strike to a single vessel, and that not a ship of war,
was, he said, such an innovation, that he durst not,
without express orders, agree to it. The Captain,
thinking it dangerous to renew firing in the midst of the
Dutch fleet, continued his voyage; and for this neglect
of orders was committed to the Tower.</P>
<P>THIS incident however furnished Downing with a
new article to increase those vain pretences, on which
it was proposed to ground the intended quarrel. The
English court delayed several months before they com∣plained;
lest, if they had demanded satisfaction more
early, the Dutch might have had time to grant it. Even
when Downing delivered his memorial, he was bound
by his instructions not to accept of any satisfaction after
a certain number of days; a very imperious manner of
negotiating, and impracticable in Holland, where the
forms of the republic render delays absolutely unavoid∣able.
An answer, however, though refused by Down∣ing,
was sent over to London; with an Ambassador
Extraordinary, who had orders to use every expedient
which might give satisfaction to the court of England.
That court replied, that the answer of the Hollanders was
dark and obscure; but they would not specify the ar∣ticles
or expressions, which were liable to that objection.
The Dutch Ambassador desired the English ministry to
draw the answer in what terms they pleased; and he
engaged to sign it: The English ministry replied, that
it was not their business to draw papers for the
Dutch. The Ambassador brought them the draught of
an article, and asked them whether it was satisfactory:
The English answered, that, when he had signed and
delivered it, they would tell him their mind concerning
it. The Dutchman resolved to sign it at a venture;
<PB N="485" REF="579"/>
and on his demanding a new conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1672.</NOTE> an hour was
appointed for that purpose. But when he attended, the
English refused to enter upon business, and told him,
that the season for negotiating was now past<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">England's Appeal, p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LONG and frequent prorogations were made of the
parliament; lest the Houses should declare themselves
with vigour against councils, so opposite to the inclina∣tion
as well as interests of the public. Could we sup∣pose,
that Charles, in his alliance against Holland,
really meant the good of his people, that measure must
pass for an extraordinary, nay, a romantic, strain of
heroism, which could lead him, in spite of all difficul∣ties,
and even in spite of themselves, to seek the happi∣ness
of the nation. But every step, which he took in
this affair, became a proof to all men of penetration,
that the present war was intended against the liberties of
his own subjects, even more than against the Dutch
themselves. He now acted in every thing, as if he
were already an absolute monarch, and was never more
to lie under the controul of national assemblies.</P>
<P>THE long prorogation of parliament, if it freed the
King from their importunate advices and remonstrances,
was however attended with this inconvenience, that no
money could be procured to carry on the military pre∣parations
against Holland. Under pretence of main∣taining
the triple league, which, at that very time, he
had firmly resolved to break, Charles had obtained a
large supply from the Commons; but this money was
soon exhausted by debts and expences. France had sti∣pulated
to pay two hundred and forty thousand pounds
the first year of the war, and the third of that sum
every year during the course of it; but these supplies
were very inconsiderable, compared to the immense
charge of the English navy. It seemed as yet premature
to venture on levying money, without consent of par∣liament;
<PB N="486" REF="580"/>
since the power of taxing themselves was the
privilege, of which the English were, with reason, par∣ticularly
jealous. Some other resource must be fallen
on. The King had declared, that the staff of treasurer
was ready for any one, that could find an expedient
for supplying the present necessities. Shaftsbury drop∣ped
a hint to Clifford, which the latter immediately
seized, and carried to the King, who granted him the
promised reward, together with a peerage. This expe∣dient
was the shutting up the Exchequer, and retaining
all the payments, which should be made into it.</P>
<P>IT had been usual for the bankers to carry their
money to the Exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Janu∣ary. Exche∣quer shut.</NOTE> and to advance it upon the
security of the funds, by which they were afterwards
repaid, when the money was levied on the public.
The bankers, by this traffic, got eight, sometimes ten,
per cent. for sums, which either had been consigned
to them without interest, or which they had borrowed
at six per cent: Profits, which they dearly paid for by
this egregious breach of public faith. The measure
was so suddenly taken, that none had warning of the
danger. A general confusion prevailed in the city, fol∣lowed
by the ruin of many. The bankers stopped pay∣ment;
the merchants could answer no bills; distrust
took place every where, with a stagnation of com∣merce,
by which the public was universally affected.
And men, full of dismal apprehensions, asked each other
what must be the scope of those mysterious councils,
whence the parliament and all men of honour were ex∣cluded,
and which commenced by the forfeiture of pub∣lic
credit, and an open violation of the most solemn en∣gagements,
both foreign and domestic.</P>
<P>ANOTHER measure of the court contains something
laudable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of indul∣gence.</NOTE> when considered in itself; but if we reflect on
the motive whence it proceeded, as well as the time
<PB N="487" REF="581"/>
when it was embraced, it will appear a strong instance
of the arbitrary and dangerous councils, pursued at pre∣sent
by the King and his ministry. Charles resolved to
make use of his supreme power in ecclesiastical matters;
a power, he said, which was not only inherent in him,
but which had been recognized by several acts of par∣liament.
By virtue of this authority, he issued a pro∣clamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of March.</NOTE>
suspending the penal laws, enacted against
all nonconformists or recusants whatsoever, and grant∣ing
to the protestant dissenters the public exercise of
their religion, to the catholics the exercise of it in pri∣vate
houses. A fruitless experiment of this kind, op∣posed
by the parliament, and retracted by the King,
had already been made a few years after the restoration;
but Charles expected that the parliament, whenever it
should meet, would now be tamed to greater submission,
and would no longer dare to controul his measures.
Meanwhile, the dissenters, the most inveterate enemies
to the court, were mollified by these indulgent maxims:
And the catholics, under their shelter, enjoyed more li∣berty
than the laws had hitherto allowed them.</P>
<P>AT the same time, the act of navigation was suspend∣ed
by royal will and pleasure: A measure, which, tho'
a stretch of prerogative, seemed useful to commerce,
while all the seamen were employed on board the royal
navy. A like suspension had been granted, during the
time of the first Dutch war, and was not much re∣marked;
because men had, at that time, entertained
less jealousy of the crown. A proclamation was also
issued, containing very rigorous clauses in favour of
pressing: Another full of menaces against those who
presumed to speak undutifully of his Majesty's measures,
and even against those who heard such discourses, un∣less
they informed in due time upon the offenders: An∣other
against importing or vending any sorts of painted
<PB N="488" REF="582"/>
earthen ware, “except those of China, upon pain of
being grievously fined, and suffering the utmost pu∣nishment,
which might be lawfully inflicted upon con∣temners
of his Majesty's royal authority.” A new
army had been levied; and it was found, that discipline
could not be enforced without the exercise of martial
law, which was therefore established by order of coun∣cil,
though contrary to the petition of right. All these
acts of power, however little important in themselves,
favoured strongly of arbitrary government, and were
no-wise suitable to that legal administration, which the
parliament, after such violent convulsions and civil
wars, had hoped to have established in the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT may be worth remarking, that the Lord-Keeper
refused to affix the seals to the declaration for suspend∣ing
the penal laws; and was for that reason, though
under other pretences, removed from his office. Shastes∣bury
was made Chancellor in his place; and thus an∣other
member of the Cabal received the reward of his
councils.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack of the Smyrna fleet.</NOTE> FOREIGN transactions kept pace with these domestic
occurrences. An attempt, before the declaration of
war, was made on the Dutch Smyrna fleet by Sir Ro∣bert
Holmes. That fleet consisted of seventy sail, va∣lued
at a million and a half; and the hopes of seizing
so rich a prey had been a great motive for engaging
Charles in the present war, and he had considered that
capture as a principal resource for supporting his mili∣tary
enterprizes. Holmes, with nine frigates and three
yachts, had orders to go in search of this fleet; and he
passed Sprague in the channel, who was returning home
with a squadron from a cruize in the Mediterranean.
Sprague informed him of the near approach of the Hol∣landers;
and had not Holmes, from a desire of engros∣sing
all the honour and profit of the enterprize, kept
<PB N="489" REF="583"/>
the secret of his orders, the conjunction of these squa∣drons
had rendered the success infallible. When Holmes
approached the Dutch, he put on an amicable appear∣ance,
and invited the admiral, Van Ness, who com∣manded
the convoy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of March.</NOTE> to come on board of him: One of
his captains gave a like insidious invitation to the rear-admiral.
But these officers were on their guard. They
had received an intimation of the hostile intentions of
the English, and had already put all the ships of war
and merchantmen in an excellent posture of defence.
Three times were they valiantly assailed by the English;
and as often did they valiantly defend themselves. In
the third attack one of the Dutch ships of war was
taken; and three or four of their most inconsiderable
merchantmen fell into the enemies hands. The rest,
fighting with great skill and courage, continued their
course; and, favoured by a mist, got safe into their own
harbours. This attempt is denominated perfidious and
pyratical by the Dutch writers, and even by many of
the English. It merits at least the appellation of irre∣gular;
and as it had been attended with bad success, it
brought double shame upon the contrivers. The Eng∣lish
ministry endeavoured to cover the action, by pre∣tending
that it was a casual rencounter, arising from the
obstinacy of the Dutch, who refused the honours of the
flag: But the contrary was so well known, that even
Holmes himself had not the assurance to persist in this
asseveration.</P>
<P>'TILL this incident the States, notwithstanding all
the menaces and preparations of the English, never be∣lieved
them to be thoroughly in earnest; and had al∣ways
expected, that the affair would terminate either in
some demands of money, or in some proposals for the
advancement of the Prince of Orange. The French
themselves had made little account of assistance from
<PB N="490" REF="584"/>
England; and could scarce believe, that their ambitious
projects would, contrary to every maxim of honour and
policy, be forwarded by that power, which was most
interested, and most able to oppose them. But Charles
was too far advanced to retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of March. War declared with Hol∣land.</NOTE> He immediately issued
a declaration of war against the Dutch; and surely rea∣sons
more false and frivolous never were employed to
justify a flagrant violation of treaty. Some complaints
are made of injuries done to the East India Company,
which yet that company disavowed: The detention of
some English in Surinam is mentioned; though it ap∣pears,
that these persons had voluntarily remained there:
The refusal of a Dutch fleet on their own coasts to
strike to an English yacht, is much aggravated: And to
piece up all these pretensions, some abusive pictures are
mentioned, and represented as a ground of quarrel.
The Dutch were long at a loss what to make of this
article; till at last it was discovered, that a portrait of
Cornelius de Wit, brother to the pensionary, painted
by order of some magistrates of Dort, and hung up in a
chamber of the town-house, had given occasion to the
complaint. In the perspective of this portrait, the
painter had drawn some ships on fire in a harbour. This
was construed to be Chatham, where de Wit had really
distinguished himself, and had acquired great honour;
but little did he imagine, that, while the insult itself
had so long been forgiven, the picture of it should draw
such severe vengeance upon his country. The conclu∣sion
of this manifesto, where the King still professed his
attachment to the triple alliance, was of a piece with all
the rest of it.</P>
<P>THE French King's declaration of war contained
more dignity, if undisguised violence and injustice could
merit that appellation. He pretended only, that the
behaviour of the Hollanders had been such, that it did
not consist with his glory any longer to bear it. That
<PB N="491" REF="585"/>
monarch's preparations were in great forwardness; and
his ambition was flattered with the most promising views
of success. Sweden was detached from the triple league:
The bishop of Munster was engaged by the payment of
subsidies to take part with France: The elector of Co∣logne
had entered into the same alliance; and having
consigned Bonne and other towns into the hands of
Lewis, magazines were there erected; and it was from
that quarter that France proposed to invade the United
Provinces. The standing force of that kingdom amount∣ed
to one hundred and eighty thousand men; and with
more than the half of this great army was the King
now approaching to the Dutch frontiers. The order,
oeconomy, industry of Colbert, subservient equally to
the ambition of the Prince and happiness of the
people, furnished unexhausted treasures: These, em∣ployed
by the unrelenting vigilance of Louvois, sup∣plied
every military preparation, and facilitated all the
enterprizes of the army: Condé, Turenne, seconded
by Luxembourg, Crequi, and the most renowned ge∣nerals
of the age, conducted this army, and by their
conduct and reputation inspired courage into every one.
The monarch himself, surrounded with a gallant nobi∣lity,
animated his troops by the prospect of reward, or,
what was more valued, by the hopes of his approba∣tion.
The fatigues of war gave no interruption to
gaiety: Its dangers furnished matter for glory; and in
no enterprize did the genius of that gallant and polite
people ever break out with more distinguished lustre.</P>
<P>THOUGH de Wit's intelligence in foreign courts was
not equal to the vigilance of his domestic administration,
he had, long before, received many surmises of this fatal
confederacy; but he prepared not for defence, so early
or with such industry, as the danger required. An union
of England with France was evidently, he saw, destruc∣tive
to the interests of the former kingdom; and there∣fore,
<PB N="492" REF="586"/>
overlooking or ignorant of the humours and secret
views of Charles, he concluded it impossible, that such
pernicious projects could ever really be carried into exe∣cution.
Secure in this fallacious reasoning, he allowed
the republic to remain too long in that defenceless situ∣ation,
into which many concurring accidents had united
to throw it.</P>
<P>BY a continued and successful application to com∣merce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakness of the States.</NOTE>
the people were become very unwarlike, and
confided entirely for their defence in that mercenary
army, which they maintained. After the treaty of
Westphalia, the States, trusting to their peace with
Spain, and their alliance with France, had broke a
great part of this army, and did not support with suffi∣cient
vigilance the discipline of the troops which re∣mained.
When the aristocratic party prevailed, it was
thought prudent to dismiss many of the old experienced
officers, who were devoted to the house of Orange;
and their place was supplied by raw youths, the sons or
kinsmen of burgomasters, by whose interest the party
was supported. These new officers, relying on the
credit of their friends and family, neglected their mili∣tary
duty; and some of them, it is said, were even al∣lowed
to serve by deputies, to whom they assigned a
small part of their pay. During the war with England,
all the forces of that nation had been disbanded: Lewis's
invasion of Flanders, followed by the triple league, oc∣casioned
the dismission of the French regiments: And
the place of these troops, which had ever had a chief
share in the honour and fortune of all the wars in the
low countries, had not been supplied by any new levies.</P>
<P>DE WIT, sensible of this dangerous situation, and
alarmed by the reports which came from all quarters,
bestirred himself to supply those defects, to which it was
not easy of a sudden to provide a suitable remedy. But
<PB N="493" REF="587"/>
every proposal which he could make, met with opposi∣tion
from the Orange party, which was now become
extremely formidable. The long and uncontrouled ad∣ministration
of this statesman had begot envy: the pre∣sent
incidents roused up his enemies and opponents,
who ascribed to his misconduct alone the bad situation
of the commonwealth: And, above all, the popular af∣fection
to the young Prince, which had so long been
held in violent constraint, and had thence acquired new
accession of force, began to display itself, and to threaten
the commonwealth with some great convulsion. Wil∣liam
the third, Prince of Orange, was now in the
twenty-second year of his age, and gave strong indica∣tions
of all those great qualities, by which his life was
afterwards so much distinguished. De Wit himself, by
giving him an excellent education, and instructing him
in all the principles of government and sound policy,
had generously contributed to make his rival formidable.
Dreading the precarious situation of his own party, he
was always resolved, he said, by conveying to him the
knowledge of affairs, to render the Prince capable of
serving his country, if ever any future emergence should
throw the administration into his hands. The conduct
of the young Prince had hitherto been extremely lauda∣ble.
Notwithstanding his powerful alliances with Eng∣land
and Brandenburgh, he had expressed his resolution
of depending entirely on the States for his advancement;
and the whole tenor of his behaviour suited extremely
the genius of that people. Silent and thoughtful; given
to hear and to enquire; of a sound and steady under∣standing:
much firmness in what he once resolved, or
once denied; great application to business, little to
pleasure: By these virtues he engaged the attention of
all men. And the people, sensible that they owed their
liberty, and very existence, to his family, and remem∣bring,
that his great uncle, Maurice, had been able,
<PB N="494" REF="588"/>
even in more early youth, to protect them against the
exorbitant power of Spain, were desirous of raising this
Prince to all the authority of his ancestors, and hoped,
from his valour and conduct alone, to receive protection
against those imminent dangers, with which they were
at present threatened.</P>
<P>WHILE these two powerful factions struggled for su∣periority,
every scheme for defence was opposed, every
project retarded. What was determined with difficulty,
was executed without vigour. Levies indeed were
made, and the army compleated to seventy thousand
men<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE>: The Prince was appointed both general and ad∣miral
of the Commonwealth, and the whole military
power was put into his hands. But new troops could
not of a sudden acquire discipline and experience: And
the partizans of the Prince were still unsatisfied, as long
as the <HI>perpetual edict,</HI> so it was called, remained in force;
by which he was excluded from the Stadtholdership,
and from all share in the civil administration.</P>
<P>It had always been the maxim of de Wit's party to
cultivate naval affairs with extreme care, and to give
the flect a visible preference above the army, which they
represented as the object of an unreasonable partiality in
the Princes of Orange. The two violent wars, which
had of late been waged with England, had exercised the
valour, and improved the skill of the sailors. And,
above all, de Ruyter, the greatest sea commander of the
age, was closely connected with the Lovestein party;
and every one was disposed, with confidence and ala∣crity,
to obey him. The equipment of the fleet was
therefore hastened by de Wit; in hopes, that, by strik∣ing
at first a successful blow, he might inspire courage
into the dismayed States, and support his own declining
authority. He seems too, to have been, in a peculiar
<PB N="495" REF="589"/>
manner, enraged against the English; and he resolved
to take revenge on them for their conduct, of which, he
thought, his country had such reason to complain. By
the offer of a close alliance and confederacy for mutual
defence, they had seduced the Republic to quit the al∣liance
of France; but no sooner had she embraced these
measures, than they formed leagues for her destruction,
with that very power, which they had treacherously en∣gaged her to offend. In the midst of full peace, nay,
during an intimate union, they had attacked her com∣merce,
the only means of her subsistence, and, moved
by shameful rapacity, had invaded that property, which,
relying on their faith, they had hoped to find unpro∣tected
and defenceless. Contrary to their own visible
interest, as well as to their honour, they still retained a
malignant resentment for her successful conclusion of
the last war; a war, which had, at first, sprung from
their own wanton insolence and ambition. To repress
so dangerous an enemy, would, de Wit imagined, give
a peculiar pleasure, and contribute to the future secu∣rity
of his country, whose prosperity was so much the
object of general envy.</P>
<P>Actuated by like motives and views, de Ruyter put to
sea with a formidable fleet, consisting of ninety-one ships
of war and forty-four fire-ships. Cornelius de Wit was
on board, as deputy from the States. They sailed in
quest of the English, who were under the command of
the Duke of York, and who had already joined the
French under Mareschal d' Etrécs. The combined fleets
lay at Solebay in a very negligent posture; and Sand∣wich,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Solebay. 28th of May.</NOTE>
being an experienced officer, had given the Duke
warning of the danger; but received, 'tis said, such an
answer as intimated, that there was more of caution than
of courage in his apprehensions. Upon the appearance
of the enemy, every one ran to his post with precipita∣tion,
and many ships were obliged to cut their cables,
<PB N="496" REF="590"/>
in order to be in readiness. Sandwich commanded the
van; and though determined to conquer or to perish, he
so tempered his courage with prudence, that the whole
fleet was visibly indebted to him for its safety. He
hastened out of the bay, where it had been easy for de
Ruyter with his fire-ships to have destroyed the combi∣ned
fleets, which were crowded together; and by this
wise measure he gave time to the Duke of York, who
commanded the main body, and to Mareschal d' Etrées,
Admiral of the rear, to disengage themselves. He
himself meanwhile was engaged in close fight with the
Hollanders; and by presenting himself to every danger,
had drawn upon him all the bravest of the enemy. He
killed Van Ghent, the Dutch Admiral, and beat off his
ship: He sunk another ship, which ventured to lay him
aboard: He sunk three fire-ships, which endeavoured to
grapple with him: And though his vessel was torne in
pieces with shot, and of a thousand men she contained,
near six hundred were laid dead upon the deck, he con∣tinued
still to thunder with all his artillery in the midst
of the enemy. But another fire-ship, more fortunate
than the preceding, having laid hold of his vessel, her
destruction was now inevitable. Warned by Sir Ed∣ward
Haddock, his Captain, he refused to make his
escape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandwich killed</NOTE> and bravely embraced death as a shelter from that
ignominy, which a rash expression of the Duke, he
thought, had thrown upon him.</P>
<P>DURING this fierce engagement with Sandwich, de
Ruyter remained not inactive. He attacked the Duke
of York, and sought him with such fury for above two
hours, that of two and thirty actions, in which he had
been engaged, he declared this combat to be the most
obstinately disputed. The Duke's ship was so shattered,
that he was obliged to leave her, and remove his flag to
another. His squadron was overpowered with num∣bers;
till Sir Joseph Jordan, who had succeeded to
<PB N="497" REF="591"/>
Sandwich's command, came to his assistance; and the
sight, being more equally ballanced, was continued till
night, when the Dutch retired, and were not followed
by the English. The loss sustained by the fleets of the
two maritime powers was nearly equal, if it did not ra∣ther
sall more heavy on the English. The French suf∣fered
very little, because they had scarce been engaged
in the action; and as this backwardness is not their na∣tional
character, it was concluded, that they had re∣ceived
orders to spare their ships, while the Dutch and
English should weaken themselves by their mutual ani∣mosity.
Almost all the other actions during the pre∣sent
war tended to confirm this suspicion.</P>
<P>IT brought great honour to the Dutch to have fought
with some advantage the combined fleets of two such
powerful nations; but nothing less than a compleat vic∣tory
could serve the purpose of de Wit, or save his coun∣try
from those calamities which from every quarter
threatened to overwhelm her. He had expected, that
the French would make their attack on the side of Ma∣estricht,
which was well fortified, and provided of a
good garrison; but Lewis, taking advantage of his al∣liance
with Cologne, resolved to invade the enemy from
that quarter, which he knew to be more feeble and de∣fenceless.
The armies of that Elector, and those of
Munster appeared on the other side of the Rhine, and
divided the force and attention of the States. The
Dutch troops, too weak to defend so extensive a fron∣tier,
were scattered into so many towns, that no con∣siderable
body remained in the field; and a strong gar∣rison
was hardly to be found in any fortress. Lewis
passed the Meuse at Viset; and laying siege to Orsoi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of May.</NOTE> a
town of the Elector of Brandenburgh, but garrisoned by
the Dutch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the French.</NOTE> he carried it in three days. He divided
his army, and invested at once Burik, Wesel, Emerik,
and Rhimberg, four places regularly fortified, and not
<PB N="498" REF="592"/>
unprovided of troops: In a few days all these places
were surrendered. A general astonishment had seized
the Hollanders, from the combination of such powerful
Princes against the Republic; and no where was re∣sistance
made, suitable to the antient glory or present
greatness of the State. Governors without experience
commanded troops without discipline; and despair had
universally extinguished that sense of honour, by which
alone, men in such dangerous extremities can be ani∣mated
to a valorous defence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of June.</NOTE> LEWIS advanced of the banks of the Rhine, which
he prepared to pass. To all the other calamities of the
Dutch was added the extreme drought of the season, by
which the greatest rivers were much diminished, and in
some places rendered fordable. The French cavalry,
animated by the presence of their Prince, full of impe∣tuous
courage, but ranged in exact order, flung them∣selves
into the river: The infantry passed in boats: a
few regiments of Dutch appeared on the other side,
who were unable to make resistance. And thus was
executed without danger, but not without glory, the
passage of the Rhine: so much celebrated, at that time,
by the flattery of French courtiers, and transmitted to
posterity by the more durable flattery of their poets.</P>
<P>EACH success added courage to the conquerors, and
struck the vanquished with dismay. The Prince of
Orange, though prudent beyond his age, was but newly
advanced to the command, unacquainted with the army,
unknown to them; and all men, by reason of the vio∣lent
factions which prevailed, were uncertain of the au∣thority
on which they must depend. It was expected
that the fort of Skink, so famous for the sieges which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
had formerly sustained, would make some resistance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
but it yielded to Turenne in a few days. The same
General made himself master of Arnheim, Knotzem∣bourg,
<PB N="499" REF="593"/>
and Nimeguen, as soon as he appeared before
them. Doesbourg at the same time opened its gates to
Lewis: Soon after, Harderwic, Amerssort, Campen,
Rhenen, Viane, Elberg, Zwol, Cuilemberg, Wage∣ninguen,
Lochem, Woerden, sell into the enemies hands.
Groll and Deventer surrendered to the Mareschal Lux∣embourg,
who commanded the troops of Munster. And
every hour brought to the States news of the rapid pro∣gress
of the French, and of the cowardly defence of
their own garrisons.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange, with his small and discou∣raged
army, retired into the province of Holland;
where he expected, from the natural strength of the
country, since all human art and courage failed, to be
able to make some resistance. The town and province
of Utrecht sent deputations, and surrendered themselves
to Lewis. Naerden, a place within three leagues of
Amsterdam, was seized by the Marquis of Rochfort;
and had he pushed on to Muyden, he had easily got
possession of it. Fourteen stragglers of his army having
appeared before the gates of that town, the magistrates
sent them the keys; but a servant maid, whoi was alone
in the castle, having raised the drawbridge, kept them
from taking possession of that fortress. The magistrates
afterwards, finding the party so weak, made them drunk,
and took the keys from them. Muyden is so near Am∣sterdam,
that its cannon may infest the ships which en∣ter
that city.</P>
<P>LEWIS with a splendid court made a solemn entry<NOTE PLACE="marg">2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of June.</NOTE>
into Utrecht, full of glory, because every where attend∣ed
with success; though more owing to the cowardice
and misconduct of his enemies, than to his own valour
or prudence. Three provinces were already in his
hands, Guelderland, Overysiel, and Utrecht; Groning∣hen
was threatened; Friezeland lay exposed: The
<PB N="500" REF="594"/>
only difficulty lay in Holland and Zealand; and the
monarch deliberated concerning the proper measures for
reducing them. Condé and Turenne exhorted him to
dismantle all the towns, which he had taken, except a
few; and fortifying his main army by the garrisons, put
himself in a condition of pushing his conquests. Lou∣vois,
hoping that the other provinces, weak and dis∣mayed,
would prove an easy prey, advised him to keep
possession of places, which might afterwards serve to
retain the people in subjection. His council was fol∣lowed;
though it was found, soon after, to have been
the most impolitic.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Consternati∣on of the Dutch.</NOTE> MEANWHILE the people, throughout all the Repub∣lic,
instead of colecting a noble indignation against the
haughty conqueror, discharged their rage upon their
own unhappy minister, on whose prudence and integrity
every one formerly bestowed the merited applause. The
bad condition of the armies was laid to his charge: The
ill choice of governors was ascribed to his partiality:
As instances of cowardice multiplied, treachery was sus∣pected;
and his former connections with France being
remembered, the populace believed, that he and his
partizans had now combined to betray them to their
most mortal enemy. The Prince of Orange, notwith∣standing
his youth and inexperience, was looked on as
the only saviour of the State; and men were violently
drove by their fears into his party, to which they had al∣ways
been led by favour and inclination.</P>
<P>THE town of Amsterdam alone seemed to retain some
courage; and by forming a regular plan of defence, en∣deavoured
to infuse spirit into the other cities. The
magistrates obliged the burgesses to keep a strict watch:
The populace, whom want of employment might en∣gage
to mutiny, were maintained by regular pay, and
armed for the defence of the public. Some ships, which
<PB N="501" REF="595"/>
lay useless in the harbour, were refitted, and stationed
to guard the city: And the sluices being opened, the
neigbouring country, without regard to the great da∣mage
sustained, was laid under water. All the province
followed this example, and scrupled not, in this extre∣mity,
to restore to the sea those fertile fields, which
with infinite art and expence had been won from it.</P>
<P>THE States of Holland met to consider, whether any
means were left to save the remains of their lately flou∣rishing,
and now distressed Commonwealth. Though
they were surrounded with waters, which barred all ac∣cess
to the enemy, their deliberations were not con∣ducted
with that tranquility, which could alone suggest
measures, proper to extricate them from their present
difficulties. The nobles gave their vote, that, provided
their religion, liberty, and sovereignty could be saved,
every thing else should without scruple be sacrificed to
the conqueror. Eleven towns concurred in the same
sentiments. Amsterdam singly declared against all trea∣ty
with insolent and triumphant enemies: But notwith∣standing
that opposition, ambassadors were dispatched to
implore the pity of the two combined monarchs. It
was resolved to sacrifice to Lewis Maestricht and all
the frontier towns, which lay without the bounds of
the seven provinces; and to pay him a large sum for
the charges of the war.</P>
<P>LEWIS deliberated with his ministers Louvois and
Pomponne, concerning the measures which he should
embrace in the present emergence; and foutunately for
Europe, he still preferred the violent councils of the
former. He offered to evacuate his conquests on condi∣tions,
that all duties lately imposed on the commodi∣ties
of France should be taken off; that the public ex∣ercise
of the Romish religion should be permitted;
the churches shared with the Catholics, and their
<PB N="502" REF="596"/>
priests maintained by appointments from the States;
that all the frontier towns of the Republic should be
resigned to him, together with Nimeguen, Skink, Knot∣zembourg,
and that part of Guelderland which lay on
the other side of the Rhine; as likewise the isle of Bom∣mel,
that of Voorn, the fortress of St. Andrews, that of
Louvestein and Crevecoeur; that they should pay him
the sum of twenty millions of livres for the charges of
the war; that they should every year send him a solemn
embassy, and present him with a golden medal, as an ac∣knowledgment,
that they owed to him the preservation
of that liberty, which by the assistance of his predecessors
they had been able to acquire; and that they should
give entire satisfaction to the King of England: And
he allowed them but ten days for the acceptance of these
exorbitant demands.</P>
<P>THE ambassadors, who came to London, met with
still worse reception: No minister was allowed to treat
with them; and they were retained in a kind of con∣finement.
But notwithstanding this rigorous conduct
of the court, the presence of the Dutch ambassadors ex∣cited
the sentiments of tender compassion, and even in∣dignation
among the people in general, but especially
among those who could foresee the aim and result of
those dangerous councils. The two most powerful
monarchs, they said, in Europe, the one by land, the
other by sea, have, contrary to the faith of solemn trea∣ties,
combined to exterminate an illustrious Republic:
What a dismal prospect does their success afford to the
neighbours of the one, and to the subjects of the other?
Charles had formed the triple league, in order to restrain
the exorbitant power of France: A sure proof, that he
does not now err from ignorance. He had courted and
obtained the applauses of his people by that wise mea∣sure:
As he now adopts contrary councils, he must sure∣ly
expect by their means to render himself independent
<PB N="503" REF="597"/>
of his people, whose sentiments are become so indiffe∣rent
to him. During the most entire submission of the
nation, and most dutiful behaviour of the parliament,
dangerous projects, without provocation, are formed to
reduce them to subjection, and all the foreign interests
of the people are sacrificed, in order the more surely to
bereave them of their domestic liberties. Lest any in∣stance
of freedom should remain within their view, the
United Provinces, the real barrier of England, must be
abandoned to the most dangerous enemy of England;
and by an universal combination of tyranny against laws
and liberty, all mankind, who have retained, in any de∣gree,
their precious, though hitherto precarious, birth∣rights,
are for ever to submit to slavery and injustice.</P>
<P>THOUGH the fear of giving offence to his confederate
had engaged Charles to treat the Dutch ambassadors
with such rigour, he was not altogether withoiut unea∣siness,
on account of the rapid and unexpected progress
of the French arms. Were Holland entirely conquered,
its whole commerce and naval force, he saw, must be∣come
an accession to France; the Spanish Low Coun∣tries
must soon follow; and Lewis, now independent
of his ally, would no longer think it his interest to sup∣port
him against his discontented subjects. Charles,
though he never stretched his attention to very distant
consequences, could not but foresee these obvious events;
and though incapable of envy or jealousy, he was touch∣ed
with anxiety, when he found every thing yield to the
French arms, while such vigorous resistance was made
to his own. He soon dismissed the Dutch ambassadords,
lest they should cabal among his subjects, who bore them
great favour: But he sent over Buckingham and Ar∣lington,
and soon after Lord Halifax, to negotiate anew
with the French King, in the present prosperous situa∣tion
of that monarch's affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="598"/>
THESE ministers passed through Holland; and as
they were supposed to bring peace to the distrest Re∣public,
they were received every where with the loudest
acclamations. “God bless the King of England! God
bless the Prince of Orange! Confusion to the States”!
This was every where the cry of the populace. The
ambassadors had several conferences with the States and
the Prince of Orange; but made no reasonable advances
towards in accommodation. They went to Utrecht,
where they renewed the league with Lewis, and agreed,
that neither of the Kings should ever make peace with
Holland but by common consent. They next gave in
their pretensions, of which the following are the prin∣cipal
articles; that the Dutch should give up the ho∣nour
of the flag, without the least reserve or limitation,
nor should whole fleets, even on the coast of Holland,
refuse to strike and lower their topsails to the smallest
ship, carrying the British flag; that all persons, guilty
of treason against the King, or of writing seditious li∣bels,
should on complaint, be banished for ever the do∣minions
of the States; that the Dutch should pay the
King a million sterling towards the charges of the war,
together with ten thousand pounds a year for permission
to fish on the British seas; that they should share the
Indian trade with the English; that the Prince of
Orange and his descendants should enjoy the sovereignty
of the United Provinces; at least, that they should be
invested with the dignities of Stadtholder, Admiral, and
General, in as ample a manner as had ever been en∣joyed
by any of his ancestors; and that the isle of Wal∣cheren,
the city and castle of Sluis, together with the
isles of Cadsant, Gorée, and Vorne, should be put into
the King's hands, as a security for the performance of
articles. It is most consistent with candour and reason
to suppose, that Charles had not, in his alliance with
France, proposed the utter destruction of the United
<PB N="505" REF="599"/>
Provinces; since such a scheme is scarce compatible
with the project of employing the French power for ex∣tending
his authority at home: But as the unexpected
progress of Lewis's arms had reduced the Hollanders to
the last extremity, the King was desirous of acquiring
a considerable share of that rich booty, which fortune
had thrown into their hands.</P>
<P>THE terms proposed by Lewis bereaved the Repub∣lic
of all security against any land invasion from France:
Those demanded by Charles exposed them equally to an
invasion by sea from England: And when both were
joined, they appeared absolutely intollerable, and reduced
the Hollanders, who saw no means of defence, to the
utmost despair. What extremely augmented their di∣stress,
were the violent factions with which they conti∣nued
to be every where agitated. De Wit, too perti∣nacious
in defence of his own system of liberty, while
the very being of the Commonwealth was threatened,
still perserved in opposing the repeal of the perpetual
edict, now become the object of horror to the Dutch
populace. Their rage at last broke all bounds, and bore
every thing before it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of June.</NOTE> They rose in an insurrection at
Dort, and by force constrained their burgo-masters to
sign the repeal, so much demanded. This proved a
signal of a general revolt throughout all the provinces.</P>
<P>AT Amsterdam, the Hague, Middlebourg, Rotterdam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince of O∣range Stadt∣holder.</NOTE>
the people flew to arms, and trampling under foot the au∣thority
of their magistrates, obliged them to submit to the
Prince of Orange. They expelled from their office such
as displeased them: They required the Prince to appoint
others in their place: And agreeable to the proceedings
of the populace in all ages, provided they might wreak
their vengeance on their superiors, they expressed a
great indifference for the protection of their civil li∣berties.</P>
<P><PB N="506" REF="600"/>
THE superior talents and virtues of de Wit made him,
on this occasion, the chief object of general envy, and
exposed him to the utmost rage of popular prejudices.
Four assassins, actuated by no other motive than mistaken
zeal, had assaulted him in the streets; and after giving
him many wounds, had left him for dead. One of
them was punished: The others were never questioned
for their crime. His brother Cornelius, who had behaved
with great prudence and courage on bond the fleet, was
obliged by sickness to come ashore, and he was now
confined to his house at Dort. Some assassins broke in
upon him; and it was with the utmost difficulty that
his family and servants could repel their violence. At
Amsterdam, the house of the brave de Ruyter, the sole
resource of the distrest Commonwealth, was surrounded
by the enraged populace, and his wife and children were
for some time exposed to the most imminent danger.</P>
<P>ONE Tichelaer, a barber, a man noted for infamy, ac∣cused
Cornelius de Wit of endeavouring by bribes to en∣gage
him in the design of poisoning the Prince of Orange.
The accusation, tho' attended with the most improbable
and even absurd circumstances, was greedily received by
the credulous multitude; and Cornelius was cited be∣fore
a court of judicature. The judges, either blinded
by the same prejudices, or not daring to oppose the po∣pular
torrent, condemned him to suffer the question.
This man, who had bravely served his country in war,
and who had been invested with the highest dignities,
was delivered into the hands of the executioner, and
torn in pieces by the most inhuman torments. Amidst
the severe agonies which he endured, he still made pro∣testations
of his innocence, and frequently repeated an
ode of Horace, which contained sentiments suited to his
deplorable condition.</P>

<P>THE judges, however, condemned him to lose his
offices, and to be banished the Commonwealth. The
pensionary, who had not been terrified from performing
the part of a kind brother, and faithful friend during
this prosecution, resolved not to desert him on account
of the unmerited infamy, which was endeavoured to be
thrown upon him. He came to his brother's prison, de∣termined
to accompany him to the place of his exile.
The signal was given to the populace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Massacre of the De Wits.</NOTE> They rose in
arms: They broke open the doors of the prison; they
pulled out the two brothers; and a thousand hands vied
with each other, who should first be embrued in their
blood. Even their death did not satiate the brutal rage
of the multitude. They exercised on the dead bodies of
<PB N="508" REF="602"/>
those virtuous citizens, indignities too shocking to be
recited; and till tired with their own fury, it was not
permitted the friends of the deceased to approach, or to
bestow on them the honours of a funeral, silent and un∣attended.</P>
<P>THE massacre of the de Wits put an end for the time
to the remains of their party; and all men, from fear,
inclination, or prudence, concurred in expressing the
most implicit obedience to the Prince of Orange. The
Republic, tho' half subdued by foreign force, and as yet
dismayed by its misfortunes, was firmly united under
one leader, and began to collect the remains of its an∣tient
vigour. William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good con∣duct of the Prince.</NOTE> worth of that heroic family
from which he sprung, adopted sentiments becoming the
head of a brave and free people. He bent all his efforts
against the public enemy: He fought not against his
country any advantages which might be dangerous to
civil liberty. Those intolerable conditions, demanded by
their insolent enemies, he exhorted the States to reject
with scorn; and by his advice they put an end to nego∣tiations,
which served only to break the courage of their
fellow citizens, and delay the assistance of their allies.
He showed them, that the numbers and riches of the
people, aided by the advantages of nature, would still
be sufficient, if they abandoned not themselves to de∣spair,
to resist, at least retard, the progress of their ene∣mies,
and preseve the remaining provinces, till the
other nations of Europe, sensible of the common danger,
could come to their relief. He represented, that as envy
of their opulence and liberty had produced this mighty
combination against them, they would in vain expect
by concessions to satisfy foes, whose pretensions were as
little bounded by moderation as by justice. He exhort∣ed
them to remember the generous valour of their an∣cestors,
who, yet in the infancy of their State, preferred
liberty to every human consideration, and rouzing their
<PB N="509" REF="603"/>
spirits to an obstinate defence, repelled all the power,
riches, and military discipline of Spain. And he pro∣fessed
himself willing to tread in the steps of his illustrious
predecessors, and hoped, that as they had honoured him
with the same affection which their ancestors paid the
former Princes of Orange, they would second his efforts
with the same constancy and manly fortitude.</P>
<P>THE spirit of the young Prince infused itself into all
his hearers. Those who lately entertained thoughts of
yielding their necks to subjection were now bravely de∣termined
to resist the haughty victor, and to defend those
last remains of their native soil, of which neither the ir∣ruptions
of Lewis nor the innundation of waters had as
yet bereaved them. Should even the ground fail them
on which they might combat, they were still resolved
not to yield the generous strife; but flying to their set∣tlements
in the Indies, erect a new empire in those re∣mote
regions, and preserve alive, even in the climates of
slavery, that liberty, of which Europe was become un∣worthy.
Already they concerted measures for executing
this extraordinary resolution; and found, that the vessels
contained in their harbours could transport above two
hundred thousand inhabitants to the East Indies.</P>
<P>THE combined Princes, finding at last some appearance
of opposition, bent al their efforts to seduce the Prince
of Orange, on whose valour and conduct the fate of the
Commonwealth entirely depended. The sovereignty of
the province of Holland was offered him, and the pro∣tection
of England and France, to insure him, as well
against the invasion of foreign enemies, as the insur∣rection
of his subjects. All proposals were generously
rejected; and the Prince declared his resolution to retire
into Germany, and to pass his life in hunting on his
lands there, rather than abandon the liberty of his coun∣try,
or betray the trust reposed in him. When Buck∣ingham
<PB N="510" REF="604"/>
urged the inevitable destruction which hung over
the United Provinces, and asked him, whether he did
not see, that the Commonwealth was ruined; <HI>There is
one certain means,</HI> replied the Prince, <HI>by which I can be
secure never to see my country's ruin: I will die in the last
ditch.</HI></P>
<P>THE people in Holland had been much incited to
espouse the Prince's party, by the hopes, that the King
of England, pleased with his nephew's advancement,
would abandon those dangerous engagements, into
which he had entered, and would afford his protection
to the distressed Republic. But all these hopes were
soon found to be fallacious. Charles still persisted in
his alliance with France; and the combined fleets ap∣proached
the coast of Holland, with an English army on
board, commanded by Count Schomberg. It is pre∣tended,
that an unusual tide carried them off the coast,
and that Providence thus interposed, in an extraordinary
manner, to save the Republic from the imminent danger
to which it was exposed. Very tempestuous weather,
it is certain, prevailed all the rest of the season; and
the combined fleets either were blown to a distance, or
dared not to approach a shore, which might prove fatal
to them. Lewis, finding that his enemies gathered cou∣rage
behind their inundations, and that no farther pro∣gress
was likely for the present to attend his arms, had
retired to Versailles.</P>
<P>THE other nations of Europe regarded the subjection
of Holland as the forerunner of their own slavery, and
retained no hopes of defending themselves, should such
a mighty accession be made to the already exorbitant
power of France. The Emperor, though he lay at a
distance, and was naturally slow in his undertakings,
began to put himself in motion; Brandenburgh shewed
a disposition to take party with the States; Spain had
<PB N="511" REF="605"/>
sent some forces to their assistance; and by the present
efforts of the Prince of Orange, and the prospect of re∣lief
from their allies, a different face of affairs began al∣ready
to appear. Groninghen was the first place which
stopped the progress of the enemy: The bishop of Mun∣ster
was repulsed from that town, and obliged to raise
the siege with loss and dishonour. Naerden was at∣tempted
by the Prince of Orange; but Mareschal Lux∣embourg,
breaking in upon his entrenchments with a
sudden irruption, obliged him to abandon the enterprize.</P>
<P>THERE was no ally on whom the Dutch more relied
for assistance than the parliament of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1673.</NOTE> which the
King's necessities at last obliged him to assemble.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Fe∣bruary. A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> The eyes
of all men, both abroad and at home, were fixed on this
session, which met after prorogations continued for near
two years. It was evident how much the King dreaded
the assembling his parliament; and the discontents uni∣versally
excited by the bold measures entered into both
in foreign and domestic administration, had given but
too just foundation for his apprehensions.</P>
<P>THE King, however, in his speech, addressed them
with all the appearance of cordiality and confidence.
He said, that he would have assembled them sooner, had
he not been desirous to allow them leisure for attending
their private affairs, as well as to give his people respite
from taxes and impositions: That since their last meet∣ing,
he had been forced into a war, not only just but
necessary, necessary both for the honour and interest of
the nation: That in order to have peace at home, while
he had war abroad, he had issued his declaration of indul∣gence
to dissenters, and had found many good effects to
result from that measure: That he heard of some ex∣ceptions
which had been taken to this exercise of power;
but he would tell them plainly, that he was resolved to
<PB N="512" REF="606"/>
stick to his declaration; and would be much offended
at any contradiction: and that though a rumour had
been spread, as if the new levied army had been intend∣ed
to controul law and property, he regarded that jea∣lousy
as so frivolous, that he was resolved to augment
his forces next spring, and did not doubt but they would
consider the necessity of them in their supplies. The
rest of the business he left to the chancellor.</P>
<P>THE chancellor enlarged on the same topics, and
added many extraoridinary positions of his own. He
told them, that the Hollanders were the common ene∣mies
of all monarchies, especially that of England, their
only competitor for commerce and naval power, and the
sole obstacle to their views of an universal empire, as ex∣tensive
as that of antient Rome: That even during their
present distress and danger, they were so intoxicated with
these ambitious projects, as to slight all treaty, nay, to
refuse al cessation of hostilities: That the King, in en∣tering
on this war, did no more than prosecute those
maxims, which had engaged the parliament to advise
and approve of the last; and he might therefore safely
say, that <HI>it was their war:</HI> That the States being the
eternal enemies of England, both by interest and incli∣nation,
the parliament had wisely judged it necessary to
extirpate them, and had laid it down as an eternal max∣im,
that <HI>delenda est Carthago,</HI> this hostile government by
all means is to be subverted: And that tho' the Dutch
pretended to have assurances, that the parliament would
furnish no supplies to the King, he was confident, that
this hope, in which they extremely trusted, would soon
fail them.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Commons entered upon business, there
lay before them an affair, which discovered, beyond a
possibility of doubt, the arbitrary projects of the King;
and the measures taken upon it, proved, that the house
<PB N="513" REF="607"/>
was not at present in a disposition to submit to them. It
had been the constant undisputed practice, ever since
the parliament in 1604, for the house, in case of any
vacancy, to issue out writs for new elections; and the
Chancellor, who, before that time, had had some pre∣cedents
in his favour, had ever afterwards abstained from
all exercise of that authority. This indeed was one of
the first steps, which the Commons had taken in esta∣blishing
and guarding their privileges; and nothing
could be more requisite than this precaution, in order to
prevent the clandestine issuing of writs, and to ensure a
fair and free election. No one but so desperate a mini∣ster
as Shaftesbury, who had entered into a regular plan
for reducing the people to subjection, could have enter∣tained
thoughts of breaking in upon a practice so reason∣able
and so well established, or could have hoped to suc∣ceed
in so bold an enterprize. Several members had
taken their seats upon irregular writs issued by the
Chancellor; but the house was no sooner assembled,
and the Speaker placed in his chair, than a motion was
made against them; and the members themselves had
the modesty to withdraw. Their election was declared
null; and new writs, in the usual form, were issued by
the Speaker.</P>
<P>THE next step taken by the Commons had the ap∣pearance
of some more complaisance; but in reality
proceeded form the same spirit of liberty and indepen∣dence.
They resolved, in order to supply his Majesty's
extraordinary occasions, for that was the expression
they used, to grant eighteen months assessment, at the
rate of 70,000 pounds a month, amounting in the whole
to 1,260,000 pounds. Though unwilling to come to a
violent breach with the King, they would not express
the least approbation of the war; and they gave him
the prospect of this supply, only that they might have
<PB N="514" REF="608"/>
permission to proceed peaceably in the redress of some
other grievances, of which they had such reason to com∣plain.</P>
<P>NO grievance was more alarming, both on account of
the secret views from which it proceeded, and the con∣sequences which might attend it, than the declaration
of indulgence. A remonstrance was immediately formed
against that exercise of prerogative. The King defended
his measure. The Commons persisted in their opposi∣tion
to it; and they represented, that such a practice,
if admitted, might tend to interrupt the free course of
the laws, and alter the legislative power, which had al∣ways
been acknowledged to reside in the King and the
two houses. All the world was in expectation, with re∣gard
to the issue of this extraordinary affair. The King
seemed engaged in honour to support his measure; and
in order to obviate all opposition, he had positively de∣clared
that he would support it. The Commons were
obliged to persevere, not only because it was dishonour∣abnle
to be foiled, where they could plead such strong
reasons, but also because, if the King prevailed in his
pretensions, an end seemed to be put to all the legal li∣mitations
of the constitution.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that the King was now come to that
delicate crisis, which he ought at first to have foreseen,
when he embraced those desperate councils; and his re∣solutions,
in such an event, ought long ago to have
been entirely fixed and determined. Besides his usual
guards, he had an army encamped at Blackheath under
the command of Mareschal Schomberg, a foreigner;
and many of the officers were of the catholic religion.
His ally, the French king, he might expect, would se∣cond
him, if violence became requisite for restraining
his discontented subjects, and supporting the measures,
which by common consent they had agreed to pursue.
<PB N="515" REF="609"/>
But Charles was startled, when he approached so dan∣gerous
a precipice, as that which lay before him. Were
violence once offered, there could be no return, he saw,
of mutual confidence and trust with his people; the pe∣rils
attending foreign succours, especially from so
mighty a prince, were sufficiently apparent; and the
success which his own arms had met with in the war
was not so great, as to increase his authority, or terrify
the melacontents from opposition. The desire of power
likewise, which had engaged Charles in these precipi∣tant
measures, had less proceeded, we may observe,
from ambition than from love of ease. Strict limitations
of the constitution rendered the government complicated
and troublesome; and it was impossible for him, with∣out
much contrivance and intrigue, to procure the
money necessary for his pleasures, or even for the regu∣lar
support of the government. When the prospect,
therefore, of such dangerous opposition presented itself,
the same love of ease inclined him to retract what it
seemed so difficult to maintain; and his turn of mind,
naturally pliant and careless, made him find little ob∣jection
to a measure, which a more haughty prince
would have embraced with the utmost reluctance. That
he might yield with the better grace, he asked the opi∣nion
of the House of Peers, who advised him to comply
with the Commons. And accordingly the King sent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of indulgence recalled.</NOTE>
for the declaration, and with his own hands broke the
seals. The Commons expressed the utmost satisfaction
with this measure, and the most entire duty to his
Majesty. The King assured them, that he would will∣ingly
pass any law, offered him, which might tend to
give them satisfaction in all their just grievances.</P>
<P>SHAFTESBURY, when he saw the King recede at
once from so capital a point, which he had publicly de∣clared
his resolution to maintain, concluded, that all
the schemes for enlarging royal authority were vanished,
<PB N="516" REF="610"/>
and that Charles was utterly incapable of pursuing such
difficlt and such dangerous measures. The parliament,
he foresaw, might push their enquiries into those coun∣cils,
which were so generally odious; and the King,
from the same facility of disposition, might abandon his
ministers to their vengeance. He was resolved, there∣fore,
to make his peace in time with that party, which
was likely to predominate and to atone for all his vio∣lences
in favour of monarchy, by like violences in op∣position
to it. Never turn was more suddedn, or less
calculated to save appearances. Immediately he entered
into all the cabals of the country party; and discovered
to them, perhaps magnified, the arbitrary councils of
the court, in which he himself had borne so deep a
share. He was received with open arms by that party,
who stood in need of so able a leader; and no questions
were asked with regard to his late apostacy. The vari∣ous
factions, into which the nation had been divided,
and the many sudden revolutions to which the public
had been exposed, had tended much to debauch the
minds of men, and to destroy the sense of honour and
decorum in their public conduct.</P>
<P>BUT the parliament, though satisfied with the King's
compliance, had not lost all those apprehensions, to
which the measures of the court had given so much
foundation. A law passed for imposing a <HI>test</HI> on all
who should enjoy any public office. Besides taking the
oaths of allegiance and supremacy, and receiving the sa∣crament
in the established church; they were obliged to
abjure all belief in the doctrine of transubstantiation.
As the dissenters had seconded the efforts of the Com∣mons
against the King's declaration of indulgence, and
seemed resolute to accept of no toleration in an illegal
manner, they had acquired great favour with the par∣liament,
and a project was adopted to unite the whole
protestant interest against the common enemy, who now
<PB N="517" REF="611"/>
began to appear formidable. A bill passed the Com∣mons
for the ease and relief of the protestant noncon∣formists;
but met with some difficulties, at least delays,
in the House of Peers.</P>
<P>THE resolution for supply was carried into a law;
as a recompence to the King for his concessions. A
general pardon likewise and indemnity was passed, which
screened the ministers from all farther enquiry. The
parliament probably thought that the best method of re∣claiming
the criminals, was to shew them, that their case
was not desperate. Even the remonstrance, which the
Commons voted of their grievances, may be regarded as
a proof, that their anger was, for the time, appeased.
None of the capital points are touched on; the breach
of the triple league, the French alliance, the shutting
up the Exchequer. The sole grievances mentioned are
an arbitrary imposition on coals for providing convoys,
the exercise of military law, the quartering and pressing
of soldiers; and they prayed, that, after the conclusion
of the war, the whole army should be disbanded. The
King gave them a gracious, though evasive answer.
When business was finished, the two Houses adjourned
themselves.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King had, for the time, receded from<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of March.</NOTE>
his declaration of indulgence, and thereby had tacitly
relinguished the suspending power, he was still resolved,
notwithstanding his bad success both at home and
abroad, to perserve in his alliance with France, and in
the Dutch was, and consequently in all those secret
views, whatever they were, which depended on those
fatal measures. The money, granted by parliament,
sufficed to equip a fleet, of which Prince Rupert was
declared Admiral: For the Duke was ser aside by the
test. Sir Edward Sprague and the Earl of Ossory com∣manded
under the Prince. A French squadron joined
<PB N="518" REF="612"/>
them, commanded by d' Etrées. The combined fleets
set sail towards the coast of Holland, and found the
enemy, lying at anchor, within the sands at Schonvelt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of May Sea-fight.</NOTE>
There is a natural confusion attending sea-fights, even
beyond other military transactions; derived from the
precarious operations of winds and tides, as well as
from the smoke and darkness, in which every thing is
there involved. No wonder, therefore, that relations
of these battles are apt to contain uncertainties and con∣tradictions;
especially when composed by writers of the
hostile nations, who take pleasure in exalting their own
advantages, and suppressing those of the enemy. All
we can say with certainty of this battle, is, that both
sides boasted of the victory; and we may thence infer,
that the action was not decisive. The Dutch, being near
home, retired into their own harbours. In a week, they
were refitted, and presented themselves again to the com∣bined
fleets. A new action ensued, not more decisive than
the foregoing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of June. Another sea-fights.</NOTE> It was not fought with great obstinacy on
either side; but whether the Dutch or the alllies first retir∣ed
seems to be a matter of uncertainty. The loss in the
former of these actions fell chiefly on the French, whom
the English, diffident of their intentions, took care to
place under their own squadrons; and they thereby ex∣posed
them to all the fire of the enemy. There seems
not to have been a ship lost on either side in the second
engagement.</P>
<P>IT was sufficient glory to de Ruyter, that with a fleet
much inferior to the combined suadrons of France and
England, he could fight without any notable disadvan∣tage;
and it was sufficient vicotry, that he could defeat
the project of a descent in Zealand, which, had it
taken place, had endangered, in the present circum∣stances,
the total overthrow of the Dutch common∣wealth.
Prince Rupert also was suspected not to favour
<PB N="519" REF="613"/>
the King's projects of subduing Holland, or enlarging his
authority at home; and from these motives, he was
thought not to have pressed so hard on the enemy, as
his well-known valour gave reason to expect. It is in∣deed
remarkable, that, during this war, thought the
English with their allies much over-matched the Hol∣landers,
they were not able to gain any advantage over
them; while in the former war, though often over-born
by numbers, they still exerted themselves with the
most heroic courage, and always acquired great re∣nown,
sometimes even signal victories. But they were
disgusted with the present measures, which they esteem∣ed
pernicious to their country; they were not satisfied
in the justice of the quarrel; and they entertained a
perpectual jealousy of their confederates, whom, had
they been permitted, they would with much more
pleasure have destroyed than even the enemy them∣selves.</P>
<P>IF Prince Rupert was not favourable to the designs
of the court, he enjoyed as little favour from the
court, at least from the Duke, who, though he could
no longer command the fleet, still possesed the chief
authority in the Admiralty. The Prince complained of
a total want of every thing, powder, shot, provisions,
beer, and even water; and he went into harbour, that
he might refit the fleet, and supply its numerous ne∣cessities.
After some weeks he was refitted; and he
again put to sea. The hostile fleets met at the mouth
of the Texel, and fought the last battle, which, during a<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of August. Another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fight.</NOTE>
course of so many years, these neighbouring maritime
powers have disputed with each other. De Ruyter,
and under him Tromp, commanded the Dutch in this
action, as in the two former: For the Prince of
Orange had reconciled these two gallant rivals; and
they retained nothing of their former animosity, except
<PB N="520" REF="614"/>
that emulation, which mades them exert themselves
with more distinguished bravery against the enemies of
their country. Brankert was opposed to d'Etreés, de
Ruyter to Prince Rupert, Tromp to Sprague. It is
remarkable, that in all actions these brave admirals last
mentioned had still seleted each other, as the only an∣tagonists
worthy each others valour; and no decisive
advantage had as yet been gained by either of them.
They fought in this battle, as if there were no mean
between death and victory.</P>
<P>D'ETREES and all the French squadron, except Rear
Admiral Martel, kept at a distance; and Brankert, in∣stead
of pressing on them, bore down to the assistance
of de Ruyter, who was engaged in furious combat with
Prince Rupert. On no occasion did the Prince acquire
more deserved honour: His conduct, as well as valour,
shone out with signal lustre. Having disengaged his
squadron from the numerous enemies, with which he
was every where surrounded, and having joined Sir
John Chichely, his Rear Admiral, who had been sepa∣rated
from him, he made haste to the relief of Sprague,
who was very hard pressed by Tromp's squadron. The
Royal Prince, in which Sprague first engaged, was so
disabled, that he was obliged to hoist his flag on board
the St. George; while Tromp was for a like reason
obliged to quit his ship, the Golden Lion, and go on
board the Comet. The fight was renewed with the
utmost fury by these valorous rivals, and by the Rear
Admirals, their seconds. Ossory, Rear Admiral to
Sprague, was preparing to board Tromp, when he saw
the St. George terribly torn, and in a manner disabled.
Sprague was leaving her in order to hoist his flag on
board a third ship, and return to the charge; when a
shot, which had passed through the St. George, took
<PB N="521" REF="615"/>
his boat, and sunk her. The Admiral was drowned, to
the great regret of Tromp himself, who bestowed on
his valour the deserved praises.</P>
<P>PRINCE Rupert found affairs in this dangerous situa∣tion,
and saw most of the ships in Sprague's squadron
disabled from fight. The engagement was renewed,
and became very close and bloody. The Prince threw
the enemy into great disorder. To increase it, he sent
among them two fire-ships; and at the same time made
a signal to the French to bear down, which if they had
done, a total victory must have ensued. But the
Prince, when he saw that they neglected his signal,
and observed that most of his ships were in no condi∣tion
to keep the sea long, wisely provided for their
safety by making easy sail towards the English coast.
The victory in this battle was as doubtful, as in all
the actions fought during the present war.</P>
<P>THE turn, which the affairs of the Hollanders took
by land, was more favourable. The Prince of Orange
besieged and took Naerden; and from this success gave
his country reason to hope for still more prosperous en∣terprizes.
Montecuculi, who commanded the Imperia∣lists
on the Upper Rhine, deceived, by the most artful
conduct, the vigilance and penetration of Turenne,
and making a sudden march, sat down before Bonne.
The Prince of Orange's conduct was no less masterly;
while he eluded all the French generals, and leaving
them behind him, joined his army to that of the Impe∣rialists.
Bonne was taken in a few days: Several
other places of the Electorate of Cologne fell into the
hands of the allies: And the communication being
thus cut off between France and the United Provinces,
Lewis was obliged to recal his forces, and to aban∣don
all his conquests, with greater rapidity than he
<PB N="522" REF="616"/>
had at first made them. The taking Maestricht was
the only advantage, which he gained this campaign.</P>
<P>A CONGRESS was opened at Cologne under the me∣diation
of Sweden; but with small hopes of success.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Congress of Cologne.</NOTE>
The demands of the two Kings were such as must have
reduced the Hollanders to perpetual servitude. In pro∣portion
as the affairs of the States rose, the Kings sunk
in their demands; but the States still sunk lower in
their offers; and it was impossible for the parties ever
to agree on any conditions. After the French eva∣cuated
Holland, the congress broke up; and the seizure
of Prince William of Furstenburg by the Imperialists,
afforded the French and English a good pretence for
leaving Cologne. The Dutch ambassadors in their me∣morials
expressed all the haughtiness and disdain, so
natural to a free State, which had met with such un∣merited
ill usage.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of Oc∣tober. A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> THE Parliament of England was now assembled,
and discovered much greater symptoms of ill humour,
than had appeared in their last meeting. They had
seen for some time a negotiation of marriage carried on
between the Duke of York and the Archduchess of
Imspruc, a catholic of the Austrian family; and they
had made no opposition. But when that intention
failed, and the Duke applied to a Princess of the house
of Modena, then in close conjunction with France;
this circumstance, joined to so many other grounds of
discontent, raised the Commons into a flame; and they
remonstrated with teh greatest zeal against the intended
marriage. The King told them, that their remon∣strance
came too late; and that the marriage was al∣ready
agreed on, and even celebrated by proxy. The
Commons still insisted; and proceeding to the exami∣nation
of the other parts of government, they voted the
<PB N="523" REF="617"/>
standing army to be a grievance, and declared, that
they would grant no more supply, unless it appeared,
that the Dutch were so obstinate as to refuse all rea∣sonable
conditions. To cut short these disagreeable at∣tacks,
the King resolved to prorogue the Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of No∣vember.</NOTE>
and with that intention he came unexpectedly to the
House of Peers, and sent the usher to summon the
Commons. It happened, that the speaker and the
usher nearly met at the door of the house; but the
speaker being within, some of the members suddenly
shut the door, and cried, <HI>To the chair, to the chair:</HI> while
others cried, <HI>The black-rod is at the door.</HI> The speaker
was hurried to the chair; and the following motions
were instantly made: That the alliance with France is
a grievance; that the evil counsellors about the King
are a grievance; that the Duke of Lauderdale is a
grievance, and not fit to be trusted or employed. There
was a general cry, <HI>To the question, to the question:</HI> But
the usher knocking violently at the door, the speaker
leaped from the chair, and the house rose in great con∣fusion.</P>
<P>DURING the interval, Shaftesbury, whose intrigues
with the malecontent party were now become notorious,
was dismissed from the office of Chancellor; and the
seals were given to Sir Heneage Finch, under the title
of Lord Keeper. The test had incapacitated Clifford;
and the white staff was conferred on Sir Thomas Os∣borne,
soon after created Earl of Danby, a minister of
ability, who had risen by his parliamentary talents.
Clifford retired into the country, and soon after died.</P>
<P>THE Parliament had been prorogued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1674.</NOTE> in order to
give the Duke leisure to consummate his marriage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE> but
the King's necessities soon obliged him again to as∣semble
<PB N="524" REF="618"/>
them; and by some popular acts he paved the
way for the sessions. But all his efforts were in vain.
The disgust of the Commons was fixed on foundations
too deep to be easily removed. They began with ap∣plications
for a general fast; by which they intimated,
that the nation was in a very calamitous condition:
They addressed against the King's guards, which they
represented as dangerous to liberty, and even as illegal,
since they had never yet received the sanction of par∣liament:
They took some steps towards establishing a
new and more rigorous test against popery: And what
chiefly alarmed the court, they made an attack on the
members of the cabal, to whose pernicous councils they
justly imputed all their present grievances. Clifford
was dead: Shaftesbury had made his peace with the
country party, and was become their leader: Buck∣ingham
was endeavouring to imitate Shaftesbury; but
his intentions were as yet known to very few. A mo∣tion
was therefore made in the house of Commons for
his impeachment: He desired to be heard at the bar;
but expressed himself in so confused and ambiguous a
manner, as gave little satisfaction. He was required to
answer precisely to certain queries, which they proposed
to him. These queries regarded all the articles of miscon∣duct
above-mentioned; and among the rest, the follow∣ing
one seems remarkable. “By whose advice was the
army brought up to over-awe the debates and reso∣lutions
of the House of Commons?” This shews to
what length the suspicions of the house were at that
timne carried. Buckingham, in all his answers, endea∣voured
to exculpate himself, and to load Arlignton.
He succeeded not in the former intention: The Com∣mons
voted an address for his removal. But Arlington,
who was on many accounts obnoxious to the house,

was attacked. Articles were drawn up against him;
though the impeachment was never prosecuted.</P>
<P>THE King plainly saw, that he could expect no sup∣ply
from the Commons for carrying on a war, which
was so odious to them. He resolved therefore to make
a separate peace with the Dutch, on the terms which
they had proposed through the canal of the Spanish
ambassador. With a cordiality, which, in the present
disposition on both sides, was probably but affected, but
which was obliging, he asked advice of the Parliament.
The Parliament unanimously concurred, both in thanks
for this gracious condescension, and in their advice for
peace. Peace was accordingly concluded. The ho∣nour
of the flag was yielded by the Dutch in the most
extensive terms: A regulation of trade was agreed to:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Holland.</NOTE>
All possessions were restored to the same condition as
before the war: The English planters in Surinam were
allowed to remove at pleasure: And the States agreed
to pay to the King the sum of eight hundred thousand
patacoons, near three hundred thousand pounds. Four<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Fe∣bruary.</NOTE>
days after the Parliament was prorogued, the peace
was proclaimed in London, to the great joy of the
people. Spain had declared, that she could no longer
stand neuter, if hostilities were continued agaist Hol∣land;
and a great decay of trade was foreseen, in case
a rupture should ensue with that nation. The pros∣pect
of this loss contributed very much to increase the
national aversion to the present war, and to enliven the
joy for its conclusion.</P>
<P>THERE was in the French service a large body of
English to the number of ten thousand men, which
had acquired great honour in every action, and had
contributed greatly to the successes of Lewis. These

troops, Charles said he was bound by treaty not to
recall; but he obliged himself to the States by a se∣cret
article not to allow them to be recruited. His
partiality to France prevented a strict execution of
this article.</P>
