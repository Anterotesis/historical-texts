<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>RUTH</HI> and <HI>Fiction</HI> have, of late,
been so promiscuously blended to∣gether,
in Performances of this
Nature; that, in the present
Case, it seems absolutely neces∣sary
to distinguish the <HI>one</HI> from the <HI>other.</HI> If
<HI>Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders,</HI> and Collo∣nel
<HI>Jack</HI> have had their Admirers among the
lower Rank of Readers; it is as certain,
that the Morality in Masquerade, which may
be discovered, in the Travels of <HI>Lemuel Gul∣liver,</HI>
has been an equal Entertainment to the
superior Class of Mankind.</P>
<P>Now it may, without the least Arrogance,
be affirmed, that, tho' this <HI>surprising Narra∣tive</HI>
be not so replete with <HI>vulgar Stories</HI> as
the former, or so interspersed with a <HI>Satiri∣cal</HI>
Vein, as the last of the abovementioned
Treatises; yet it is certainly of more Use to
the publick, than either of them, because
every Incident, herein related, is real Mat∣ter
of Fact. But because my Share in this
Work, is no other than that of a bare Edi∣tor;
I think it my Duty to account for
the Possession of this Manuscript.</P>
<P>It was put into my Hands, about a Year
ago, by Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> an eminent Mer∣chant,
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
with full Liberty to publish it when,
and in what Manner, I thought most proper.
I hope therefore it will not be deemed imper∣tinent
to give some Account of my Friend,
as a Reputation to the Work it self.</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>Edward Dorrington</HI> is descended
from a very ancient and honourable Fa∣mily
in <HI>Staffordshire.</HI> His Grandfather,
Mr. <HI>Joseph Dorrington,</HI> removed out of that
County, to <HI>Frome</HI> in <HI>Somersetshire;</HI> his
Employ was that of a very considerable
Grasier: The Issue he left at his Decease
was one Son, <HI>Richard</HI> (the Father of my
Friend) and two Daughters. Mr. <HI>Richard
Dorrington,</HI> for some Time, was a Student
of <HI>Gray's-Inn;</HI> but, liking a Country-Life
best, he having thoroughly qualified him∣self,
retired to <HI>Frome,</HI> the abovemention∣ed
Residence of his Father, where he
married Mrs. <HI>Margaret Groves,</HI> of <HI>Taunton,</HI>
a Gentlewoman of about a thousand
Pounds Fortune. Soon after his Marriage,
he went and settled at <HI>Bath,</HI> where the
Integrity of his fair Practice, soon ren∣dered
him eminent in his Profession. He
acquired a very competent Estate, and
died in the Year 1708, having no other
Issue than his only Son, the present Mr.
<HI>Edward Dorrington,</HI> whom he had put to
be bred a Merchant, under the Care of
Mr. <HI>Stephen Graham</HI> of <HI>Bristol.</HI> His Di∣ligence,
and courteous Behaviour, during
his Servitude, so highly recommended
him to his Master's Esteem, that when
his Time was expired, he admitted him
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
into a Moiety of his Commerce, married
him to his Daughter, and gave her a hand∣some
Portion suitable to his Merit.”</P>
<P>“The Happiness of my Acquaintance
with him, began in his Apprenticeship,
and has, with the greatest Satisfaction to
me continued ever since”. As to the
Genuineness of this Treatise, I am far∣ther
to assure the Reader, that as Mr. <HI>Dor∣rington</HI>
is allowed by all who know him,
to be a Gentleman of unquestionable Vera∣city,
and above attempting an Imposition
upon the Publick; so the <HI>first</HI> Book herein
was wholly written by himself, and the <HI>se∣cond</HI>
and <HI>third</HI> Books were faithfully tran∣scribed
from Mr. <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Parchment Roll,
which was a Continuation of what my
Friend had begun.</P>
<P>When Mr. <HI>Dorrington</HI> undertook this Voy∣age,
he set Sail, as is well known, from <HI>Bri∣stol</HI>
to the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> and traded all along
that Coast to <HI>Mexico,</HI> now called <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P>And he is now making a second Voyage
to the same Places.</P>
<P>To proceed to the Work it self. The <HI>first</HI>
Book contains a Relation of Mr. <HI>Dorrington</HI>'s
Discovery of Mr. <HI>Quarll,</HI> his several Confe∣rences
with him; a Description of the
Island, and the Manner of our <HI>Hermit</HI>'s Li∣ving
there; with many other curious Parti∣culars.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> and <HI>third</HI> Books are the Con∣tents
of the <HI>Hermit</HI>'s <HI>Parchment-Roll</HI> above∣mentioned,
and contain the most surprizing,
as well as various Turns of Fortune ever
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
yet recounted in any Work of this Kind.
And, altho the continued Series of Misfor∣tunes
which attended him, seemed to render
his Life a Precedent of the most unhappy
State of human Nature; yet we do not find
the greatest Notoriety in his Actions, that
Vengeance should pursue him so closely by
unparalelled Crosses. If Polygamy could call
down such divine Resentments, we must be
silent; nor farther urge his Fate.</P>
<P>However, for this Fact he was brought to
Justice by the Laws of his Country, and he
accounts for the Inducements of his commit∣ting
that Sin, at his Tyral. This Reflection
therefore should be wiped off, since he is
now become the humblest of Penitents. The
Observations, throughout these Sheets will
be found to be modest, serious, and instru∣ctive,
and all center in the unerring Moral,
that,
<Q><L>Whate'er we do, or wheresoe'er we're driven,</L>
<L>Still, we must own, such is the Will of Heaven.</L></Q></P>
<P>To conclude, in the Publication of these
Papers, I have discharged two Promises; the
one made by Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> to the <HI>Hermit,</HI>
and the other made by my self to Mr. <HI>Dor∣rington;</HI>
and that they may meet with a Re∣ception,
as candid as they are useful, is the
hearty Wish of the Reader's humble Servant,</P>

<HEAD>ON THE
HERMIT'S SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<L>BEHOLD a Man in his <HI>first-Class</HI> of Years,</L>
<L>When youthful Sports made way for growing Cares,</L>
<L>The checquer'd Fortunes of a manly Age,</L>
<L>Busies reflecting Sense with Thoughts more sage:</L>
<L>Various Affairs will cause a World of Woes,</L>
<L>Then in the Fall of Life how sweet's Repose;</L>
<L>The Calm, he now enjoys, makes full Amends</L>
<L>For all he felt; Heaven ne'er Ill intends;</L>
<L>Suff'rings are sent to us from God above,</L>
<L>To make us Practice Faith and sacred Love;</L>
<L>Aw'd into Patience, by fresh Scenes of Fate,</L>
<L>We live too soon, and learn to live too late,</L>
<L>In busy Worlds and Trading-Peopled Towns,</L>
<L>More fast we sin, than Sin itself abounds.</L>
<L>In soft Repose, Empires does <HI>Quarll</HI> disdain,</L>
<L>Free from Disquiet, Solitude's his Gain,</L>
<L>Thoughts more sublime, a Haven more serene,</L>
<L>Nought e'er to vex him that may cause the Spleen:</L>
<L>Methinks I with him share of <HI>Eden</HI>'s Grove,</L>
<L>And wish no better Paradise to rove;</L>
<L>Here's not <HI>Ambition</HI> with her gaudy Train,</L>

<L>Nor <HI>Avarice</HI> nor haughty <HI>Pride</HI> invade,</L>
<L>Nor can <HI>Remorse</HI> his slumb'ring Nights upbraid;</L>
<L><PB N="x" REF="8"/>
In peace he rests, unenvy'd or unknown,</L>
<L>And pities Monarchs on their toilsome Throne.</L>
<L>No King that Reigns, but must as Mortals die,</L>
<L>And when they Rule, no Subject should ask why?</L>
<L>Heaven grants them Licence, and when God gives Laws,</L>
<L>Where's the bold Man that dares dispute the Cause.</L>
<L>Would the Great Men, from one so mean be told,</L>
<L>They serve a Grown for Interest and for Gold.</L>
<L>'Tis with Content <HI>Quarll</HI> lives, he's truly blest,</L>
<L>Has nought to dread, nor is with nought distrest;</L>
<L>Prays for his Country, and its present Prince,</L>
<L>That he may reign in Heaven, when call'd from hence.</L>
<L>Here, in these lonely Shades he just uprose,</L>
<L>A Type of Resurection to disclose;</L>
<L>A Resurrection from a Wat'ry Hell,</L>
<L>Where Shoals of Terrors strove which should excell.</L>
<L>A Resurrection, Emblem of the Last,</L>
<L>Which will recall our ev'ry Guilt that's past;</L>
<L>Drawing a Glave of Conscience to our View,</L>
<L>Of Horror for our Sins, both old and new;</L>
<L>But so unspotted in his present State,</L>
<L>I'd wish my self as happy; not more Great;</L>
<L>I'd know to Change but when God calls obey,</L>
<L>Prepar'd in my Accompt for Judgment-day;</L>
<L>Then happy rise from Cares and worldly Toys,</L>
<L>To more substantial and eternal Joys.</L>
<L>This honest <HI>HERMIT,</HI> at a transient View</L>
<L>Seems to be born all Prec'dent to out-do,</L>
<L>Something uncommon makes him wond'rous seem,</L>
<L>Sound are his Morals, drawn from ev'ry Theme.</L>
<L><PB N="xi" REF="9"/>
Thus from our <HI>English</HI> HERMIT learn to know,</L>
<L>That early Piety opposes Woe;</L>
<L>Thro' every Stage of Life see <HI>Philip</HI> tost,</L>
<L>And on a Desart Shore by Tempest cast,</L>
<L>Where he's most happy, when imagin'd lost.</L>
<L>So true it is the GODS our Good design,</L>
<L>As labouring Slaves dig Diamonds from a Mine:</L>
<L>From rugged Rocks the Sailor gains a Prize,</L>
<L>And Shipwreck'd oft, from Death, to Life arise;</L>
<L>So may we at the Last dread Trumpet's sound,</L>
<L>By true Repentance here on Earth, be found</L>
<L>Acceptable in Heaven, where Joys abound.</L>
<L>In grateful Hymns Hail in, the new-spring Day,</L>
<L>And like the Angels never cease to Pray:</L>
<L>A Kingdom <HI>Quarll</HI> doth undisturb'd enjoy,</L>
<L>He's rais'd a Monarch, from an abject Boy.</L>
<L>And here I can't omit the pencil'd Plan,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Beaufidelle</HI> his Monkey, and his Man:</L>
<L>The docile Beast most servilely obeys,</L>
<L>And justly merits more than Human Praise,</L>
<L>A Beauty of his Kind, good natur'd too,</L>
<L>A Brute so pleasing, wonderful, and new,</L>
<L>Subservient to his Lord, loving and just,</L>
<L>Where's Human Servant we can thus Intrust?</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING concluded those Mercan∣tile
Affairs, which I undertook, by
this Voyage, to negotiate; and be∣ing
upon my Return for <HI>England,</HI>
and wind-bound; during my Stay,
I daily walked about the Sea-shore:
Very early one Morning, the Weather being ex∣treme
fair, and the Sea wonderful calm, as I was
taking my usual turn, I accidentally fell into Dis∣course
with a Spanish, <HI>Mexican</HI> Inhabitant, named
<HI>Alvarado.</HI> And, as we were viewing the Rocks
which abound in those Seas, he desired me to take
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
notice of a vast long one about seven Leagues
from Shore, which he said was supposed to in∣close
some Land, by its great Extent; but the
Access to it was very dangerous, by reason of the
Rocks which reach so far under Water, being in
some places too shallow for Boats, and in others
too deep to ford over, and the Sea commonly
very rough in that Place, hitherto prevented farther
Re-search, supposing the Advantage which might
accrue from the Land, would not countervail the
Cost and Trouble of making it inhabitable; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that he and some Friends had on a fine Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
it now was, the Curiosity to go as near as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
could with Safety, which was above fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
from the main Rock, but were forced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as
unsatisfied as they went; only, that he had the
Pleasure of catching some delicious Fish which
lay playing upon the Surface of the Water, having
a Rod in his Hand, and Lines in his Pocket, be∣ing
seldom without when he walks on the Sea∣shore;
these Fish are somewhat larger than a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er∣ring
in its Prime, skinned like a Mackerel, made as
a Gudgeon, and of divers beautiful Colours, espe∣cially
if catched in a fair Day, having since ob∣served
that they are more or less beautiful, ac∣cording
to the Serenity of the Weather.</P>
<P>The Account he gave me of them excited my
Curiosity to go and catch some, and he being, as
usual, provided with Tackle, we picked up a
parcel of yellow Maggots, which breed in dead
Tortoises upon the Rock, at which those Fishes
bite very eagerly.</P>
<P>Thus equipt with all Necessaries for the
Sport, we agreed with a young Fellow, one
of the Long-Boat's-Crew, belonging to the
Ship I was to come over in, whose Master
being just come on Shore, and not expected
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o return speedily, he readily consented to row us
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither for about the value of a Shilling.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place, we found extraordinary
Sport, the Fishes were so eager, that our Line was
no sooner in but we had a Bite.</P>
<P>Whilst we were fishing, the young Man that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow'd us thither, spying a Clift in the Rock, thro'
which he saw a Light, had a mind to see what was
at the other side; so put off his Cloaths in order
to wade to it, thus having taken the Hitcher of the
Boat, he gropes along for sure Footing, the Rock
being very full of Holes.</P>
<P>Being come to the Clift, he creeps through, and
in a short time returns, calling to us with Preci∣pitation,
which express'd both Joy and Surprize:
Gentlemen! Gentlemen! said he, I have made a
Discovery of a new Land, and the finest that the
Sun did ever shine on; leave off your Fish∣ing,
you'll find here much better Business: Having
by that time catch'd a pretty handsome Dish of Fish,
we put up our Tackling, fasten'd our Boat to the
Rock, and so went to see this new-found Land.</P>
<P>Being come at the other side of the Rock, we saw,
as he said, a most delightful Country, but despair'd
going to it, there being a Lake about a Mile long,
at the Bottom of the Rock, which parted it from
the Land; for neither <HI>Alvarado</HI> nor my self could
swim; but the young Fellow who could, having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eap'd into the Water, finding it all the way but Breast
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>high, we went in also, and waded to the other side,
which ascended gently, about five of six Foot from
the Lake to a most pleasant Land, flat and level,
cover'd with a curious Grass, something like Camo∣mile,
but of no Smell, and of an agreeable Taste;
it bore also abundance of fine lofty Trees, of diffe∣rent
Kinds and Make, which in several places stood
in Clusters, composing Groves of different Height
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
and Largeness; being come to a Place where the
Trees stood in such a Disposition as gave our Sight
a greater Scope, we saw at some distance a most de∣lightful
Wood of a considerable Extent. The A∣greeableness
of the Perspective, made by Nature
both for the creating Pleasure and Condolance of
Grief, did prompt my Curiosity to a View of the
Delights, which the Distance we were at might i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
some measure rob us of; but <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who
till then, had discern'd nothing whereby we coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>judge
the Island to be inhabited, was fearful, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would not venture farther that way, lest we shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of a sudden be sallied upon by wild Beasts out of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Wood; and, as I could not discommend his Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣caution,
the Thickness of it giving room to believe
there might be dangerous Creatures in it, so we wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Southward, finding Numbers of fine Trees, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
here and there small Groves, which we judg'd to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

Examination, we found it, to our great Amazemen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to proceed of only one Plant, whose outmost lowe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

covered a considerable Spot of Ground, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
growing less, as they stood farthest from the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>Having walk'd some time under that most surpri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing
and wonderful Plant, admiring the Greatness <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Nature's Works, we went on, finding several of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
same in our way, wherein harbour'd Monkeys, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
their swift Flight prevented our discerning the
Colours; yet going on we found there were tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
kinds, the one green Backs, yellow Faces and Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lies;
the other grey, with white Bellies and Faces
but both sorts exceeding beautiful.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="17"/>
At some distance we perceived three things stand∣ing
together, which I took to be Houses; I believe,
said I, this Island is inhabited; for, if I mistake not,
yonder are Dwellings: So they be, said <HI>Alvarado,</HI>
and therefore I don't think it Wisdom to venture any
further, lest they should be Savages, and do us hurt;
so would have gone back; but I was resolved to see
what they were, and persuaded him to go on, saying,
it would be time enough for us to retreat when we
perceiv'd Danger: That may be too late, said he,
for, as Evil doth not always succeed Danger, Dan∣ger
doth not always preceed Evil; we may be sur∣priz'd.
Well, well, said I, if any should come up∣on
us we must see them at some Distance, and
if we can't avoid 'em, here's three of us, a good
long Staff, with an Iron Point at one End, and a
Hook at the other, I shall exercise that, and keep
them off, at least till you get away; come along,
and fear not, so pull'd him along.</P>
<P>Being come near enough to discern better, we
found what we took for Houses were rather Ar∣bours,
being apparently made of green Trees, then
indeed I began to fancy some wild People did in∣habit
them, and doubted whether safe or no to go
nearer, but conceal'd my Doubt lest I should intimi∣date
<HI>Alvarado,</HI> so that he should run away, to
which he was very much inclin'd. I only slac∣ken'd
my Pace, which <HI>Alvarado</HI> perceiving, ima∣gin'd
that I saw some Evil a coming, which he
thought unavoidable; and not daring to go from
his Company, I only condol'd his Misfortune, say∣ing,
he dearly repented taking my Advice, that he
fear'd we should pay dear for our silly Curiosity;
for indeed those things were more like Thieves Dens,
or wild Peoples Huts, than Christians Habitations.</P>
<P>By this time we were come near a Spot of Ground,
pretty clear of Trees, on which some Animals were
<PB N="6" REF="18"/>
feeding, which I took to be Goats; but <HI>Alvarado</HI>
fancy'd them to be Deers, by their swift Flight
at our appearing; however I infer'd by their Shy∣ness
that we were out of the way in our Judgment
concerning the Arbours; for, said I, if these were
inhabited, those Creatures would not have been so
scar'd at the Sight of Men; and, if by nature wild,
they would not graze so near Mens Habitations, had
there been an body in them. I rather believe some
Hermit has formerly liv'd there, and is either dead
or gone: <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who to that time had nei∣ther
heard nor seen any thing that could contradict
what I said, began to acquiesce to it, and goes on.</P>
<P>Being come within reach of plain Discernment, we
were surpriz'd; if these, said I, be the Works of Sa∣vages,
they far exceed our expert Artists; there Re∣gularity
appear'd unconfin'd to the Rules of Art,
and compleat Architecture without the Craft of the
Artist, Nature and Time only being capable to bring
them to that Perfection. They were neither Houses,
Huts, nor Arbours, yet had all the Usefulness and
Agreements of each.</P>
<P>Having sufficiently admir'd the uncommon Beau∣ty
of the Outsides, without Interruption, but rather
diverted with the most agreeable Harmony of vari∣ous
Singing-Birds, as perch'd on a green Hedge,
which surrounded about one Acre of Land near
the Place, we had the Curiosity to see the Inside,
and being nearest the middle-most, we examin'd
that first, it was about nine Foot high, and as
much square, the Walls very strait and smooth,
cover'd with green Leaves, something like those of
a Mulberry-Tree, lying as close and regular as Slates
on a slated House, the Top went up rounding like
a Cupola, and covered in the same manner as the
sides; from each Corner issued a strait Stem, about
twelve Foot higher, bare of Branches to the Top,
<PB N="7" REF="19"/>
which were very full of Leaves, and did spread over,
making most pleasant Canopy to the Mansion be∣neath.</P>
<P>Being full of Admiration with the wonderful
Structure, and Nature of the Place, we came to a
Door which was made of green Twigs, neatly
woven, and fastened with a small Stick, thro' a
Loop made of the same.</P>
<P>The Door being fasten'd without, gave us En∣couragement
to venture in it, being evident that
the Host was absent; so we open'd it, and the first
thing we saw, being opposite to the Door, was a
Bed lying on the Ground, which was a hard dry
Hearth, very smooth and clean; we had the Curio∣sity
to examine what it was made of, and found
it another Subject of Admiration; the Covering
was a Mat about three Inches thick, made of a
sort of Grass, which, tho' as dry as the oldest
Hay, was as green as a Leek, felt as soft as Cot∣ton,
and was as warm as Wool; the Bed was made
of the same, and in the same manner, but three
times as thick again, which made it as easy as a
Down Bed; under that lay another, but something
harder.</P>
<P>At one side of the Room stood a Table made
of two Pieces of thin Oak Board, about three
Foot long, fasten'd upon four Sticks driven into the
Ground, and by it a Chair made of green Twigs as the
Door, at the other side of the Room lay a Chest on
the Ground like a Sailor's small Chest, over it, against
the Wall, hung a Linen Jacket and Breeches, as Sea∣men
wear on board; on another Pin hung a large
Coat or Gown, made of the same sort of Grass,
and after the same manner as the Bed's Covering,
but not above half an Inch thick, and a Cap by it
of the same; these we suppos'd to be a Winter-Garb
for some body.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="20"/>
Having view'd the Furniture of the Dwelling, we
examin'd its Fabrick, which we could not find out
by the Outside being so closely cover'd with Leaves;
but the Inside being bare, we found it to be several
Trees, whose Bodies met close, and made a solid
Wall, which, by the Breadth of every Stem, we
judg'd to be about six Inches thick, their Bark being
very smooth, and of a pleasant Olive-Colour, made
a mighty agreeable Wainscotting; the Roof, which
was hung very thick with Leaves, was Branches,
which reach'd from End to End, and were cross'd
over by the side-ones that were woven between, which
made a very even and smooth Cieling, so thick of
Leaves and Branches, that no Rain could penetrate:
My Companion's Uneasiness, expecting the Host's
Return every Moment, hinder'd my examining eve∣ry
thing more narrowly. And having slightly look'd
into the Chest, which lay open, wherein we saw no∣thing
but Sheets of Parchment, which his Haste
would not permit me to look into; we went a∣way.</P>
<P>Going out, we saw at one Corner of the Room be∣hind
the Door a couple of Firelocks, the Sight of
which much alarm'd my Company; and, I must con∣fess,
startled me; for, till then, I was inclinable to be∣lieve
some Hermit did dwell in the Place; but finding
Arms in the room of a Crucifix and religious Pi∣ctures,
which are the common Ornaments of those
religious Men, made me waver in my Opinion; and
having taken the Pieces in my Hands, which for Rust
appear'd not to have been fit for Use for many
Years, renew'd my former Opinion, supposing them
to be the Effects of some Shipwreck which the Her∣mit
found upon the Rocks; but my Company per∣sisting
in their own, hasten'd out, and would have
gone quite away, without seeing any more, had I
not, by many Arguments made them sensible, that if
<PB N="9" REF="21"/>
those Arms had been intended for the evil Use he
did imagine, they would have been kept in better
Order; to which being oblig'd to acquiesce, he con∣sented
to go and examine the other, being as worthy
of Admiration as that we had seen, tho' quite of an∣other
Nature, but much of the same Height and
Make.</P>
<P>The next we came at was cover'd all over with
the same sort of Grass as grew on the Ground,
which lay as even as tho' it had been mow'd and
roll'd; behind it were several Lodges, made, as it
were, for some Dogs, but we neither saw nor heard
any.</P>
<P>Having view'd the Place all round, we plac'd the
young Fellow with us at the Outside to give notice
when any body appear'd, least we should be surpriz'd,
whilst we saw the Inside. So having open'd the
Door, which was made and fasten'd after the man∣ner
of the first; we went in, expecting to find ano∣ther
Dwelling, but it prov'd rather a Kitchen,
there being no Bed, only a parcel of Shells of dif∣ferent
Sizes, which we supposed to be used for U∣tensils;
some being callow'd at the Outside, as hav∣ing
been on the Fire, but extreme clean within, the
rest were, both Inside and Outside, as fine as Nakes
of Pearl.</P>
<P>At one End of the Room was a Hole cut in the
Ground like Stew-Stoves in great Kitchens, about
three or four Foot from that there was another Fire∣place,
made of three Stones fit to roast at, in both
which Places appear'd to have been Fire lately by
Wood-Coals and Ashes fresh made. This confirm'd
my Opinion, that it was an Hermitage: <HI>Alvara∣do,</HI>
who all along fear'd we should meet with Men as
would misuse us, was not a little pleas'd to find Fire∣places
in room of Beds, and Kitchen-Utensils instead
of Weapons. I hope, said he, we are not in so
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>
great a Danger as I fear'd, here cannot be many
Men, unless they croud together in yonder Place;
and if so they would have been here before now,
had they been in the Way. His Fears being in
a great measure dispers'd, we look'd about more lei∣surely,
and seeing several Shells, that were cover'd,
on a Shelf that lay cross two Sticks, that were stuck
in the Wall, which was made of Turff, we had the
Curiosity to see what was in them, and found in
one pickl'd Anchoves, in others Mushrooms, Ca∣pers,
and other sorts of Pickles: Let them, said I,
be who they will that dwell here, I am sure they
know good Eating, and therefore probably may be
no Stranger to good Manners. Upon another Shelf,
behind the Door, lay diverse sorts of dry'd Fishes,
and upon the Ground stood uncover'd two Chests
with Fish and Flesh in Salt.</P>
<P>These Provisions, being something too Epicurial
for an Hermit, gave us room for Speculation.
I have liv'd (said <HI>Alvarado</HI>) at <HI>Mexico</HI> these
six Years, and have been at <HI>Peru</HI> above twenty
times, and yet never heard talk of this Island:
The Access to it is so difficult and dangerous, that
I dare say we are the first that have been of these
sides of the Rocks; I am very apt to believe that a
Company of determinate Buccaneers, which are said
to frequent these Seas, shelter here, and that the
Habitation we have seen, and this Place, belong
to their Captain, and that the Company resorts in
Caves up and down these Rocks. Really I could not
well gainsay it, being too probable, yet I would
not altogether acquiesce to his Opinion, lest
he should thereby take a Motive to go away be∣fore
we had seen the other Place: I must confess,
said I, here's Room for Conjectures, but no Proof
of Certainty; however let it be as you say, 'tis a
plain case here be none to disturb us, therefore whilst
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>
we have Liberty, let us see the other Place: So
we fasten'd the Door as we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound it, and went
to the next, which was shut after the same man∣ner
as the two preceding, but made of quite different
Stuff, being a complete Arbour, compos'd of Trees,
planted within a Foot of one another, whose Branches
were woven together in that regular manner, that
they made several agreeable Compartiments, and so
close, that nothing but Air could enter; it was of
the same Height and Bigness with the Kitchen, which
stood at the other End of the Dwelling, which made
a very uniform Wing to it.</P>
<P>The Coolness of the Arbour remov'd our Doubts
of its being another Dwelling, unless only us'd in
hot Weather.</P>
<P>Having sufficiently view'd the Outside, we went
in, and found several Boards, like Dressers or Ta∣bles,
in a Pantry, on which lay divers broad and
deep Shells, as beautiful as those in the Kitchen, in
some of which was Butter, in others Cream and Milk;
on a Shelf lay several small Cheeses, and on another
a Parcel of Roots like <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Artichoaks, which
look'd to have been roasted: All this did but confirm
the Opinion we were in, that it was no Hermitage,
there being what to gratify the Appetite, as well as
to support Nature; therefore, not knowing what
to think of the Master of the House, we made
no long Stay, but concluded to haste, and get our
Fish dress'd, it being near Dinner-time; and as the
Trees stood very thick inland, so might conceal Men
from our Sight, till come too near to shun 'em; we
thought it proper to walk at the Outside near the
Rocks, that we might see some Distance before us.</P>
<P>Walking along, a Phlegm sticking in my Throat,
I happened to hawk pretty loud, the Noise was an∣swer'd
from, I believe, twenty places of the Rock, and
in as many different Sounds, which so alarm'd <HI>Al∣varado,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="24"/>
who took it to be a Signal from Men
conceal'd up and down the Rock, not considering
the Difficulty of their coming at us, there being a
Lake at the Foot of it, which they must have
been oblig'd to wade over, and which would have
given us time to get away: But Fear, which often
binds Reason, did represent the Evil infallible to
his Thought, which was morally impossible. I did
all I could to make him sensible it was but Ecchoes,
and to convince him thereof, I gave a loud Hem,
which was answer'd in like manner, but by being a
second time repeated, and by a louder Voice, I was
certain the last did not proceed from me, which put
me in apprehension some body besides my self had
hem'd also. My Companion, whose Countenance
being turn'd as pale as Death, express'd the Excess
of his Fears, would have run away, had not the
Voice come from the very way we were to go:
Now, said he (hardly able to utter his Words for
trembling) you are, I hope, convinc'd it would have
been safer for us to retire, instead of gratifying your
unreasonable Curiosity, what do you think will be∣come
of us? The young Fellow at these Words
falls a Weeping, saying, he wish'd he had miss'd the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etting of that Money, which was like to be dear∣ly
earn'd. I must confess, I begun to be a little
apprehensive of Danger, and wish'd my self safe a∣way,
but conceal'd my Thoughts, heartning them
as well as I could, and representing the Danger e∣qual,
moving forwards or standing still; I at last
persuaded them to go on.</P>
<P>We were scarce gone forty Paces further, but
that we perceived at a considerable Distance some∣thing
like a Man, with another Creature, but pre∣sently
lost them amongst the Trees, before we
could have a full View of them, which made eve∣ry
one of us conceive a different Idea of what we
<PB N="13" REF="25"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad seen. <HI>Alvarado</HI> would have it to be a Gi∣ant,
and a Man of common size with him, and both
arm'd Cap-a-pee. The poor Lad, who was already
as bad as a Slave, being bound to a severe ill-na∣tur'd
Master fear'd Death more than Bondage, so
took what he had seen for some She-bear, and one
of her Whelps with her, to make her yet more
dreadful; and by all means would have thrown him∣self
into the Lake, in order to get at the other
side of the Rock; thus the Danger appear'd to each
of them to be what they dreaded most; but I was
something better compos'd in Mind than they. I
gave the Object I saw the likeliest Resemblance the
time it was in Sight did permit, which I could
adapt to nothing but a Man of common Size,
and something like a Dog with him; so persist∣ing
in my Opinion made them waver theirs; thus
we went on something better compos'd.</P>
<P>Being gone about an hundred Yards further, we
saw the same again, but nearer hand, and without
Interruption, the Place being pretty clear of Trees;
thus having a full View, we were all, to our great
Satisfaction, convinc'd, that what had been taken
for a formidable Giant, and a terrible She-bear, was
but an ordinary Man; but that which was with him
running up a Tree as soon as he perceiv'd us, pre∣vented
our discerning what Animal it was; but
the Man, who walk'd on a-pace, soon came with∣in
the Reach of a more certain Discernment, and
appear'd to be a venerable old Man, with a wor∣shipful
white Beard, which cover'd his naked Breast;
and a long Head of Hair of the same Colour,
which, spreading over his Shoulders, hung down
to his Lions.</P>
<P>His Presence, which inspir'd Respect more than
Fear, soon repeal'd the frighten'd Folks scar'd
Senses, who, to cover this Faint-heartedness, ex∣cus'd
<PB N="14" REF="26"/>
themselves by the Misrepresentations Distance
causes on Objects. The old Man, who by that
time was come near enough to discern our speak∣ing
<HI>English,</HI> lets fall a Bundle of Sticks, he had
under one Arm, and a Hatchet he carried in the
other Hand, and runs at me, being the next to
him, embracing me, saying, dear Countrymen, for I
hear ye are <HI>English,</HI> by what Accident are ye come
here; a Place the Approach, whereof is defended by
a thousand Perils and Dangers, and not to be come
at but by a narrow Escape of Death, are ye ship∣wreck'd?
No, thank God, said I, most reverend
Father, it was mere Curiosity that brought us here,
those Perils, which you say defend the Approach of
this Island, being absent by the extraordinary Calm∣ness
of the Sea; but if I may ask, pray how came
you here? by the Help of Providence, reply'd the
good old Man, who snatch'd me from out of the
ravenous Jaws of Death, to six me in this safe and
peaceable Spot of Land; I was shipwreck'd, thanks
to my Maker, and was sav'd by being cast away. I
conceive, Sir, said I, you have been chas'd by
some Pyrates, and escap'd Slavery by striking up∣on
the Rocks that surround this Island; but now
you have avoided that dismal Fate, embrace the
lucky Opportunity of getting away from a Place so
remote from human Assistance, which your Age
makes you stand in need of. That's your Mi∣stake,
reply'd the old Man, he who trusts in God
needs no other Help. I allow that, Sir, said I,
but our Trust in God doth not require us to cast
away, or despise the Help of Man. I don't in the
least question your Piety, but mistrust the Frailty
of Nature, and Debility of Age, therefore would
have you come and live within the Reach of At∣tendance;
you may, without slackening your De∣votion,
live in the World; you shall have no
<PB N="15" REF="27"/>
Occasion to concern your self with any Cares that
may disturb your pious Thoughts. No, reply'd
the old Man, was I to be made Emperor of the
Universe, I would not be concern'd with the
World again, nor would you require me, did you
but know the Happiness I enjoy out of it; come
along with me, and if, after you have seen how I live
here, you persist in your Advice, I will say you have
no Notion of a happy Life. I have, good Sir, said I,
already seen with great Admiration your matchless
Habitation, but there are other Necessaries which
your Age requires, as Cloaths to defend the Injuries
of the Air, and Meat suitable to the Weakness of
your Stomach. That's your Mistake, reply'd the
old Man, I want for no Cloaths, I have a Change
for every Season of the Year, I am not confin'd to
Fashions, but suit my own Conveniencies. Now
this is my Summer Dress, I put on warmer as the
Weather grows colder; and for Meat, I have Fish,
Flesh and Fowls, and as choice as Man can wish
for; come, you shall dine with me, and ten
to one but I may give you a Venison, and
perhaps a Dish of wild Fowls too; let's go
and see what Providence has sent us. So we
went to a Wood, about a Mile further, where
he had fasten'd several low Nets at different
Gaps in the Thick-set, in one of which happen'd
to be an Animal, something like a Fawn as big a∣gain
as a Hare, and the Colour of a Fox, fac'd
and footed like a Goat: Did I not tell you, said
the Good Man, I might chance to give you Veni∣son?
Now let's look after the Fowls; so we went
a little further at a Place where he had hung a long
Net between two high Trees, at the Bottom of
which was fasten'd a Bag of the same to receive
the Fowls, who in the Night being stop'd by the
Net, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lutter'd to the Bottom. There also happen'd
<PB N="16" REF="28"/>
to be Game, a couple of Fowls made like Wood∣cock,
but the Bigness and Colour of a Pheasant,
were taken at the Bottom of the Bag: Now, said
the old Man, these I have without committing the
Sin of bidding less for them than I know they are
really worth, or make the Poulterers swear they
cost them more than they did. Well, now I may
give you a Dish of Fish also, 'tis but going hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Mile, or thereabouts. There's no need, Sir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
said, I, for any more, there's but four of us, and
here's Provision for half a score; but if you are
dispos'd for Fish, we have some in a Boat at the o∣ther
side of the Rock; 'tis but going for them.
Very well, said the old Man, 'tis but going above
a Mile, then strip and wade over a Lake, then climb
up a rugged Rock twice backward and forward to
fetch what we can have for only taking a pleasant
Walk, all the while diverted with the sweet Har∣mony
of a number of Fine Birds; look here, this
Complaisance often puts Men to a World of needless
Trouble; come, we'll make shift to pick a Dinner
out of these. Sir, said I, 'tis no Shift where there's
such Plenty. Plenty! said the old Man, why I tell
ye this is a second Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> only here's no
forbidden Fruit, nor Women to tempt a Man. I
see, Sir, said I, Providence supplies you plentifully
with Necessaries, did not Age deprive you of
Strength. Age! reply'd the old Man, why I'm
not so old as that comes to neither; I was but
eight and twenty when I was cast away, and that's
but fifty Years ago: Indeed if I did live as you do
that dwell in the wise World, who hurry on your
Days as if your End came on too slow, I might be
accounted old. I don't gainsay, reverend Father,
but that you bear your Age wonderful well; but
Multiplicity of Days must make the strongest Na∣ture
bend: Yes, Time will break the toughest Con∣stitution,
<PB N="17" REF="29"/>
and by what you say you have seen a
considerable Number of years. Yes, reply'd the old
Man, a few Days have ran over my Head, but I ne∣ver
strove to out-run them, as they do that live too
fast: Well, says he, you are a young Man, and have seen
less Days than I, yet you may be almost worn out;
come, match this, says he; with that he gave a Hem with
such a Strength and Clearness, that the Sound made
my Ears tingle for some Minutes after. Indeed, Sir,
said I, you have so far out-done what I can pretend
to do, that I will not presume to imitate you.
Then I am afraid, says he, you will prove to be the old
Man. Well then, you or your Friend, the strong∣est
of you, fetch hither that Stone, it does not
look to be very heavy (pointing at a large Stone
that lay about two Yards off.) I'll endeavour, Sir,
said I, to roll it, for I dare say 'tis past my Strength
to lift it: So, to please the old Man, I went to take
it up, but could hardly move it. Come, come, said
the old Gentleman, I find that must be work for me;
with that he goes, takes up the Stone, and tosses it
to the Place he bid me bring it: I see, said he, you
have exerted your Strength too often, makes you
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow so weak: Well, you see the Advantage of liv∣ing
remote from the World; had you had less of
human Assistance, I am apt to believe you would
not want it so soon as you are likely to do; come, let's
make much of that little Strength we have left,
by taking necessary Support at proper times; 'tis
now past Noon, therefore let's lose no time, but
haste home to get our Dinner ready; so we went
back to the Place where the Bundle of Sticks lay,
which we made the young Fellow with us to carry,
and went directly to the Kitchen, where, whilst
he made a Fire, one cast the Animal, and the other
two pull'd the Fowls. I am sorry, said the old
Man, you must take that Trouble, but your Presence
<PB N="18" REF="30"/>
has frightned away my Servant, who us'd to do that
Work for me. Have you a Servant then, Sir, said I?
Yes, said he, and one a Native of this Island. Then,
I find, Sir, said I, this Island is inhabited. Yes, an∣swered
the old Man, with Monkeys and my self,
but no body else, thank God; otherwise, I can tell
you, I should hardly have liv'd so long. Then, Sir,
said I, I suppose that was it we saw run up a Tree.
Yes, said he, my Monkey, like my self, love not much
Company. Pray, Sir, said I, how did you bring
him so well under Command, as to keep with you,
when he has Liberty to run away? I wonder the wild
ones do not intice him from you. I had him young,
reply'd the old Man, and made very much of him,
which those Creatures dearly love; besides, when he
was grown up the wild ones would not suffer him
amongst 'em; so that he was forc'd to remain with
me. I had another before this; but him, I may say,
was sent by Providence, both to be a Help and Di∣version
to me; for he was so knowing, that he took
a great deal of Labour off my Hands, and dispers'd
many anxious Hours, the Irksomeness of my Solitude
did create; 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow about twelve Years since, for I
keep a Memorial, which indeed I designed to have
been a Journal, but I unfortunately let the regular
order of the Days slip out of my Memory; howe∣ver
I observe a seventh Day, and reckon the Years
from Winter to Winter, so I cannot well mistake.</P>
<P>One Day that I had roasted a Quantity of Roots,
which I eat instead of Bread, having spread them on
my Table and Chest to cool, in order to lay them
by for use, I went out, leaving my Door open to let
the Air in.</P>
<P>Having walk'd an Hour or two I returned home,
where I found a Monkey, whom the Smell of the
hot Roots had brought, who, during my Absence,
had been eating: My Presence very much surpriz'd
<PB N="19" REF="31"/>
him, yet he still kept his Place, only discontinued eat∣ing,
staring me in the Face. The unexpected Guest
at once startled me, and fill'd me with Admiration;
for certainly no Creature of its kind could be com∣par'd
to it for Beauty; his Back was of a lively
green, his Face and Belly of a lively yellow, his
Coat all over shining like burnish'd Gold: The ex∣traordinary
Beauty of the Creature rais'd in me an
ardent Desire to keep him, but despar'd of ever mak∣ing
him tame, being come to its full Growth; there∣fore
having resolv'd to keep him ty'd, I went in and
shut the Door; the Beast, who till then had not of∣fered
to make his Escape, appear'd very much di∣sturb'd,
and star'd about him for some Place to get
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut at; perceiving his Disorder, I did not advance,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut turn'd my back to him, to give it time to com∣pose
it self, which he, in a short time, did, as ap∣pear'd
by his falling to eat again, which made me
conceive hopes, that I should in time make him fa∣miliar;
having about me stale roasted Roots, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at much pleasanter than the fresh, and are less
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuffing, I threw some at him, at which he seem'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ispleas'd, and stood still a while, staring in my Face;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut my looking well pleas'd, which I believe the Ani∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al
was sensible of, made him pick them up, and fall
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eating with a fresh Appetite. I was overjoy'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his easy Composure, so reach'd him Water in a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hell, that the want of nothing might induce him
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Retreat, I set it down as near him as I could
without disturbing him, he came to't very orderly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd having drank his Fill, he laid it down, and lookt
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Face, carelessly scratching his Backside;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeing he had done, I advanc'd and took away the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hell, at which he never stir'd.</P>
<P>The forward Disposition of the Beast, towards a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfect Familiarity, made me resolve to stay within
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Remainder of the Day, no wise questioning but
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>
my Company would, in a great measure, advance it;
so I made a Shift to sup upon a few Roots I had a∣bout
me, and went pretty early to Bed; where I
was no sooner laid, but the Creature got a-cross the
Feet thereof, and continued very quiet till the next
Morning that I got up, at which time he was also
watching my Actions: I made very much of him,
which he took very composedly, standing to be
stroak'd; then indeed I thought my self, in a man∣ner,
secure of him, and gave him his Belly-full, as
the Day before, but having a pressing Occasion to go
out, I went to the Door, thinking to shut him in
till my Return; but he follow'd me so close, that I
could not open it, without endangering his getting
out, which, tho' he appear'd pretty tame, I did not
care to venture, our Acquaintance being so very new;
yet as I was oblig'd to go, I did run the Hazard; so
opened the Door by Degrees, that if in case the Beast
should offer to run, I might take an Opportunity to
slip out and keep him in; but the Creature never
offering to go any further than I went, I did
trust him to go with me, hoping, that if he went
away, the kind Usage he met with, would one Day
or other make him come back again; but to my great
prize, as well as Satisfaction, he readily return'd
with me, having waited my time; yet as I had
occasion to go out a second time, wanting Sticks
to make fire, for which I was oblig'd to go near
the Place where most of his kind did resort, I was
afraid to trust him with me, lest he should be decoy'd
by the others; therefore having taken up a Bundle
of Cords wherewith I tie up my Faggots, I watch'd
an Opportunity to get out, and leave him behind;
but the Beast was certainly apprehensive of my De∣sign;
for it always kept near the Door, looking wish∣fully
at my Bundle of Cords, as desirous of such
another, which having not for him, I cut a Piece
<PB N="21" REF="33"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff mine, and gave it him; and seeing I could not
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave him behind, I ventur'd to let him go with me,
which he did very orderly, never offering to go one
Step out of the way, tho' others of his kind came
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o look at him as he went by.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place where I us'd to cut dry
Sticks, having cut down a sufficient Quantity, I be∣gan
to lay some a-cross my Cord; the Creature,
having taken notice of it, did the same to his, and
with that Dexterity and Agility, that his Faggot
was larger and sooner made than mine, which by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat time being large enough, and as much as he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould well carry, I bound it up, which set him to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the same with his, which was abundantly too
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge a Load for him.</P>
<P>Our Faggots being made, I took up that which I
had made, to see how he would go about taking up
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, which being much too heavy for him, he could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot lift; so runing round it I believe twenty times,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e look'd me in the Face, as craving Help: Hav∣ing
been sufficiently diverted with the out-of-the-way
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hifts he made, I gave him mine, and took up
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is; the poor Animal appear'd overjoy'd at the
Exchange, therefore cheerfully takes up the Bundle,
and follows me home.</P>
<P>Seeing my self, according to all Probability, sure
of the dear Creature, whose late Actions gave me
such Grounds to hope from him both Service and
Pleasure, I return'd my hearty Thanks to kind Pro∣vidence
for his late prodigious Gift; for certainly
it was never heard of before, that in a Desart
Place, such wild Animals, who fly at the single Ap∣pearance
of a human Creature, should voluntarily
give it self to a Man, and from the very Begin∣ning
be so docile and tractable; Oh! surely it was
endu'd with more than natural Instinct; for perfect
Reason was seen in all its Actions: Indeed I was
<PB N="22" REF="34"/>
happy whilst I had him, but my Happiness, alas!
was not of long standing. As he spoke I perceiv'd
Tears in his Eyes; Pray, Sir, said I, what became
of that wonderful Creature? Alass! said he, he
was kill'd by Monkeys of the other kind, who fell
upon him one Day as he was going for Water by
himself; for the poor dear Creature was grown
so knowing, that if at any time either Firing or
Water was wanted, I had nothing to do, but to
give him the Bundle of Cords or the empty Vessel,
and he would strait go and fetch either; in short,
he wanted nothing but Speech to complete him for
human Society. Indeed, Sir, said I, I cannot blame
you for bemoaning the Loss of so incomparable a
Creature; the Account you give of him well de∣serves
his Memory a Regret; but I hope this you
have now, in a great measure, makes up your Loss.
O! not by far, reply'd the old Man, indeed he goes
about with me, and will carry a Faggot, or a Ves∣sel
of Water, pick a Fowl, turn the Spit or
String when Meat is roasting; yet he is nothing
like my late dear <HI>Beaufidelle;</HI> for so I call that most
lovely Creature; besides this is unlucky, in imitating
of me he often does me Mischief: 'Twas but t'other
Day, that I had been writing for five or six Hours, I
had occasion to go out, and happen'd to leave my
Pen and Ink upon my Table, and the Parchment I
had been writing on close by it; I was no sooner
gone but the mischievous Beast falls to work, scra∣bling
over every Word I had been writing; and
when he had done he lays it by in the Chest, as
he saw me do what I had written, and takes out
another, which he does the same to, and so to
half a score more; my Return prevented his doing
more Mischief; however in a quarter of an Hour
that I was absent, he blotted out as much as I
had been full six Months writing; indeed I was an∣gry,
<PB N="23" REF="35"/>
and could have beaten him, but that I considered
my Revenge would not have repar'd the Damage, but
rather perhaps add to my Loss, by making the
Beast run away. Pray, Sir, said I, how came you
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y him, did he also give himself to you? No,
reply'd the old Man, I had him young, and by mere
Accident, unexpected and unsought for, having lost
both Time and Labour about getting one in the
Room of him I had so unfortunately lost: The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld ones are so fond of their young, that they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever are from them, unless in their Play they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hace one another in the other kinds Quarters, where
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Dams dare not follow them; for they are such
Enemies to one another, that they watch all Oppor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unity
to catch whom they can of the contrary sort,
whom they immediately strangle, which keeps their
Encrease very backward, that would otherwise
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>row too numerous for the Food the Island produces;
which is, I believe, the Cause of their Animosity.</P>
<P>About eight Years ago, which is the time I have
had this Beast, I was walking under one of the Clusters
of Trees where the green sort of Monkeys harbour,
which being the largest and most shady in the Island
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> took the most delight therein; as I was walking, at
a small Distance from me this Creature dropt off
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tree, and lay for dead, which being of the grey
kind, made me wonder less at the Accident: I
went and took him up, and accidentally handling
his Throat, I open'd his Wind-pipe, which was al∣most
squeez'd close by that which took him, whom
my sudden Coming prevented from strangling quite.
I was extreamly pleas'd at the Event, by which I got
what my past Cares and Diligence never could pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure
me. Having pretty well recovered its Breath,
and seeing no visible Hurt about it, I imagin'd I
soon might recover him quite; so hasten'd home
with it, gave it warm Milk, and laid it on my Bed;
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
so that with careful nursing, I quite recover'd him▪
and with good Keeping made the Rogue thrive to
that degree, that he has out-grown the rest of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
kind. No question, Sir, said I, having taken such
Pains with him, you love him as well as his Pre∣decessor.
I cannot say so neither, reply'd the old
Man, tho' I cannot say but that I love the Crea∣ture,
but its having the ill Fortune to be of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
unlucky kind as was the Death of my dear <HI>Beau∣fidelle,</HI>
in a great measure lessens my Affection; be∣sides
he falls so short both of his Merit and Beau∣ty,
that I must give the deceas'd the Preference; and
was it not for his cunning Tricks, which often di∣vert
me, I should hardly value him at all; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
is so very cunning and facetious, that he makes
me love him, notwithstanding I mortally hate his
kind: I must divert you whilst Dinner is getting
ready, with an Account of some of his Tricks.</P>
<P>Being extreme fond of me, he never scarce would
be from me, but follow me every where; and as he
us'd to go with me when I went to examine my
Nets, seeing me now and then take out Game, he
would of his own accord, when he saw me busy
writing, go and fetch what hapen'd to be taken.</P>
<P>One Day finding a Fowl in the Net-bag, he pull'd
it alive as he brought it home; so that I could not
see any thing whereby to discern its kind: As soon
as he came in he sets it down with such Motions
as did express Joy; the poor naked Fowl was no
sooner out of his Clutches, but that it took too its
Heels for want of Wings; its sudden Escape so
surpriz'd the Captor, that he stood amaz'd for a
while, which gave the poor Creature time to gain a
considerable Scope of Ground; but the astonish'd
Beast, being recovered from his Surprize, soon made
after it, but was a considerable time before he could
catch it, having nothing to lay hold of, so that the
<PB N="25" REF="37"/>
Fowl would slip out of his Hands: The Race held
about a quarter of an Hour, in which time the poor
Creature, having run it self out of Breath, was
forc'd to lie down before its Pursuer, who imme∣diately
threw him self upon't, so took it up in his
Arms, and brought it home; but was not so ready
to set it down as before; for he held it by one
Leg till I had laid hold of it.</P>
<P>I had a second time as good Diversion, but after
another manner: One Morning early, whilst I was
busy in my Cottage, he went out unperceiv'd by
me, and having been a considerable time absent,
I fear'd some such another Accident had befallen
him as had done his Predecessor; so I went to
see after him, and as he would often go and vi∣sit
the Nets in the Wood, I went thither first,
where I found him very busy with such an Animal
as this we have here, whom he found taken in
one of the Gap-nets, who, being near as big as he,
kept him a great while strugling for Mastership;
sometimes he would take it by the Ears, now and
then by one Leg, next by the Tail, but could not
get him along; at last he laid hold of one of his hind
Legs, and with the other Hand smote him on the Back,
in order to drive him, not being able to pull him a∣long;
but the Beast being too strong, still made
towards the Thick-set, where he certainly would
have haul'd the Driver, had not I came up to help
him. Thus the old Gentleman entertain'd us with
his Monkey's Tricks whilst Dinner was dressing.</P>
<P>The Dinner being ready, we went to the Dwelling
to eat it, leaving the young Fellow that was with us
to attend the roast Meat whilst we eat the first Dish.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman having laid the Cloth, which,
tho' something coarse, being made out of part of a
Ship-sail, was very clean: He laid three Shells on
it, about the Bigness of a middle-siz'd Plate, but as
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>
beautiful as any Nakes of Pearl I ever saw. Gentle∣men,
says he, if you can eat off of Shells, ye are wel∣come,
I have no better Plates to give you. Sir,
said I, these are preferable to Silver ones in my
Opinion, and I very much question whether any
Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> can produce so curious a Service.
They may richer, reply'd the old Man, but not
cleaner.</P>
<P>The first Dish he serv'd was Soop in a large deep
Shell, as fine as the first, and one Spoon made
of Shell, which he said was all his Stock, being not
us'd nor expecting Company; however he fetch'd
a couple of Muscle-shells, which he wash'd very
clean, then gave <HI>Alvarado</HI> one, and took the other
himself, obliging me to make use of the Spoon;
so we sat down, <HI>Alvarado</HI> and I upon the Chest,
which we drew near the Table, and the old Gentle∣man
(tho' much against his Will) upon the
Chair.</P>
<P>Being sat down we fell to eating the Soop, whose
fragrant Smell did excite my Appetite, and I profess
the Taste thereof was so excellent, that I never eat any
comparable to't at <HI>Pontack</HI>'s, nor any where before;
it was made of one half of the Beast we took in
the Morning, with several sorts of Herbs which eat
like Artichoaks, Asparagus and Sallery; there were
also Bits of roasted Roots in it, instead of toasted
Bread, which added much to the Richness of it,
tasting like Chesnuts; but what surpris'd me most,
there were green Peas in it, whose extraordinary
Sweetness was discernable from every other Ingredi∣ent.
Pity, said I, the Access to this Island is so dif∣ficult,
what a blessed Spot of Land would it make
was it but inhabited! here naturally grows what in
<HI>Europe</HI> we plough, till, and labour hard for. You
say, reply'd the old Man, this would be a blessed
Spot of Ground if it was inhabited; now I am quite
<PB N="27" REF="39"/>
of another Opinion; for I think its Blessing consists
in its not being inhabited, being free of those
Curses your populous and celebrated Cities regorge
of; here's nothing but Praises and Thanksgivings
heard; and as for Nature bestowing freely and of
her own Accord, what in <HI>Europe</HI> you are oblig'd to
by Industry and hard Labour, in a manner to force
From her, wonder not at; consider howmuch you
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aily rob her of her due, and charge her with Slan∣der
and Calumny; don't you frequently say, if a
Man is addicted to any Vice, that it is his Nature,
when it is the Effect and Fruit of his Corruption?
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Nature, who attended the great Origine of all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings at the Creation, is now, by vile Wretches,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eem'd in fault for all their Wickedness; had Man
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emain'd in his first and natural State of Innocence,
Nature would also▪ have continued her original In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulgence
over him; we may now think ourselves
very happy, if that Blessing attend our Labour,
which, before the Fall of Man, did flow on him, ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompanied
with Ease and Pleasure.</P>
<P>Now these Peas, which have so much rais'd your
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urprize, are indeed the Growth of this Island,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' not its natural Product, but the Gifts of Provi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence,
and the Fruit of Labour and Industry. I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave till'd the Ground, Providence procur'd the Seed,
Nature gave it Growth, and Time Increase; with
even Peas and three Beans I have, in four Years time,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ais'd Seed enough to stock a Piece of Ground, out
of which I gather a sufficient Quantity for my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, besides preserving fresh Seed. No doubt, Sir,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid I, but, when right Means are taken, Prosperity
will attend. By that time having eaten suffici∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly
of the Soop, he would himself carry the
Remains to the young Man in the Kitchen, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etch in the boil'd Meat and Oyster-Sauce, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought in another Shell much of the same Na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure
as that which the Soop was serv'd in, but
<PB N="28" REF="40"/>
something shallower, which did eat as choice as
House-Lamb.</P>
<P>Having done with that, he fetches in the other
half of the Beast roasted, and several sorts of de∣licate
Pickles I never eat of before, and Mushrooms,
but of curious Colour, Flavour and Taste; those,
said he, are the natural Product of a particular Spot
of Ground, where, at a certain time of the Year, he
did gather for the Space of six Days only, three sizes
of Mushrooms; for tho' they were all Buttons and
fit to pickle, by that time he had gathered all, he had
also to stew, and some about four Inches over, which
he broil'd, and eat as choice as any Veal-Cutlet.</P>
<P>These Pickles, Sir, said I, tho' far exceeding any
I ever did eat in <HI>Europe,</HI> are really at this time need∣less,
the Meat wanting nothing to raise its Relish,
no Flesh being more delicious.</P>
<P>Having done with that, I offered to take it away,
but he no wise would permit me, so went away with
it himself, and brought the Fowls, at which I was
something vexed; for I fear'd I should find no room
in my Stomach for any, having eat so heartily of the
Meat; but having, at his pressing Request tasted of
'em, my Appetite renew'd at their inexpressible De∣liciousness,
so I fell to eating afresh.</P>
<P>Having done with that Dish, the young Man,
who having nothing to do in the Kitchen, came,
and was bid to take away and fall to; the mean
time the good old Man fetch'd us out of his Dary
a small Cheese of his own making, which being
set down, he related to us the unaccountable
Manner he came by the Antelopes that supply'd
him with the Milk it was made withall, which
introduc'd several weighty Remarks on the won∣derful
Acts of Providence, and the Strictness of the
Obligations we lie under to our great Benefactor;
likewise the vast Encouragement we have to love
<PB N="29" REF="41"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd serve God, the Benefits and Comforts of a clear
Conscience, as also the inestimable Treasure of Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent;
from that he epitomiz'd upon the different
Tempers and Dispositions of Men, much commend∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
timely Education, as being a Means to reverse
and change evil Inclinations, highly praising the
Charity of those pious People, who chuse to bestow
good Schooling upon poor Folk's Children before
Clothing, and even Food; the first being rather the
most necessary, and the last the easiest to come at.</P>
<P>That Discourse being ended, he inquired very
carefully after the State of his dear native Country,
which, he said, he left fifty Years age, in a very in∣dulgent
Disposition. I gave him the best Account
I could at that time of all the Transactions that
had happen'd in <HI>England</HI> since his Absence. The
Relation of past Evils, said he, are but like Pi∣ctures
of Earthquakes and Shipwracks, which af∣fect
the Mind but slightly; and tho' I think my
self out of any Prince's Power, yet I shall always
partake with my Countrymen's Grief: Pray be im∣plicite,
what King have we now? A compleat Pa∣triot,
and Father to his Subjects, said I, both tender-hearted
and merciful, encouraging Virtue and sup∣pressing
Vice, a Promoter of Religion, and an Ex∣ample
of Charity. Then, said he, in a manner as
expressed Zeal and Joy, long may that pious Mo∣narch
live, and his blessed Posterity for ever grace
the <HI>British</HI> Throne, and may <HI>Old England,</HI> by its
faithful Obedience and Loyalty, henceforth attone
for its past Rebellions, that it may remove that
execrable Reproach it now lies under; to which
we all said <HI>Amen.</HI> Then he fill'd up the Shell we
drank out of, and drank good King <HI>George</HI>'s Health,
which was succeeded with that of the Royal Family,
and Prosperity to the Church: Thus ended a most
delicious and splendid Dinner, and a Conversation
<PB N="30" REF="42"/>
both delightful and instructive; but having not a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
then mentioned any thing about his own History,
which I most sadly long'd to inquire into, I beg'd
him to inform us by what Accident he came
there, and how he had so long maintain'd so good
a State of Health; to which he answer'd, Time
would not permit him to relate his own History,
being very long, and the Remainder of the Day
too short, but that he would, before we did part,
give it me in writing; having, for want of other
Occupation, made a Memorial: But as to the main∣taining
of his Health, he would tell me by word of
Mouth; the Receipt, said he, is both short and
easy, yet I fear you will not be able to follow it;
look you, you must use none but wholsome Exer∣cises,
observe a sober Diet, and live a pious Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e;
now if you can confine your self to this way o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Living, I'll be bound that you will both preserve
your Health, and waste less Money; but what's
more valuable than all that, you will not endan∣ger
your precious Soul. I return'd him Thanks
for his good Advice, and promis'd him I would
observe them as strictly as I could: I am afraid,
reply'd he, that will not be at all; you have too
many powerful Obstacles, the World and the Flesh,
from whom your Affections must be intirely with∣drawn,
and all Commerce prohibited, which is mo∣rally
impossible, whilst living; therefore since you
are oblig'd to converse with the World, I will
give you a few Cautions, which, if rightly taken,
may be of use to you.</P>
<Q><P>Make not the World your Enemy, nor rely too much
on its Fidelity.</P>
<P>Be not too free witb your Friend; Repetitions of Fa∣vours
often wear out Friendship.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="43"/>
Waste not your Vigour or Substance on Women, lest
Weakness and Want be your Reward.</P>
<P>Secrets are not safe in a Woman's Breast; tis a Con∣finement
the Sex can't bear.</P>
<P>Pass no Contract over Liquor; Wine overcomes Reason,
and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls the Ʋnderstanding.</P>
<P>He who games puts his Money in Jeopardy, and is not
sure of his own.</P>
<P>There's but little Honour to wager on sure Grounds,
and less Wisdom to lay upon a Chance.</P></Q>
<P>And in all your Dealings take this for a constant
Rule.</P>
<Q><L>He who unlawful Means advance to gain,</L>
<L>Instead of Comfort, finds a constant Pain;</L>
<L>What e'en by lawful Arts we do possess,</L>
<L>Old Age and Sickness make it comfortless.</L>
<L>Be rul'd by me, not to encrease your Store</L>
<L>By unjust Means; for 'twill but make you poor:</L>
<L>Take but your Due, and never covet more.</L></Q>
<P>I return'd him Thanks for his good Morals, the
Copy whereof I beg'd he would give me in writing,
for my better putting them in Practice, to which he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eadily consented, wishing I might observe them,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing very sure I should reap a considerable Bene∣fit
thereby, both here and hereafter.</P>
<P>The Day being pretty far spent, I was oblig'd to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink of going, which much griev'd me; for I was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o taken with his Company, that if I had not had a
Father and Mother, whose Years requir'd my Pre∣sence,
I would have spent the rest of my Days with
him, I was so delighted with his Company, and
pleas'd with his way of Living, that I almost over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook'd
my Duty; but after a Struggle with my Incli∣nation,
I was oblig'd to yield to Nature. Thus
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
having express'd my Vexation to leave so good a Man,
I took my leave: The good old Man perceiving my
Regret to leave him, could not conceal his to part
with me. Indeed, said he with Tears in his Eyes,
I should have been very glad to have had a Fellow-Creature
in this solitary Island, especially one whom
I think possess'd with a good Inclination, which I
perceive you have, by your Reluctancy in leaving
this innocent Garden of Life. I imagine you have
Relations in the World that may stand in want of
you; Heavens protect you, and send you safe to
them. I don't suppose you will ever see this Island
again, nor would advise you to venture, the Ap∣proach
of it is so dangerous; therefore, before
you go, let me shew you some of the Rarities
with which it abounds. I told him I was afraid
Time would not permit, but as he said about an
Hour or two would do, and that we had enough
Day-light, I went along with him.</P>
<P>Going out, and seeing the Guns stand behind the
Door, I ask'd what he did with them: I keep them,
said he, for a Trophy of Providence's Victory over
my Enemies, and a Monument of my fourth mira∣culous
Deliverance: As we went along, he related
to us the manner how he had been sacrilegiously rob'd
once by <HI>Indians,</HI> villainously invested twice by Py∣rates,
the Ruffans having combin'd to carry him away
like a Slave to their own Country, and there make
a Shew of him as tho' he had been a Monster.</P>
<P>Talking, we walk'd under several of the afore∣mention'd
Clusters of Trees, which proceed from
one single Plant; being come to one larger than
the rest, and which he said he frequented most,
being the largest in the Island. This, said he, co∣vers
with its own Branches a whole Acre of Land;
so made several Remarks on the wonderful Works
of Nature, which, said he, were all intended for the
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
Use and Pleasure of Man, every thing in the Uni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erse
containing such different Vertues and Proper∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies,
as were requisite to render Life happy; from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he made several moral Reflections on the fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al
Effects of Disobedience, which is accounted a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight Breach in Duty, but is the Mother of all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins.</P>
<P>That Discourse held on a considerable time, till a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arcel of each different Kind of Monkeys having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, fell to fighting, observing an admirable Order
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring the Fray, which withdrew our Admiration
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the preceding Subject, and stopt us a while to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bserve them.</P>
<P>The Scuffle was very diverting whilst it lasted,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich was but a short time; for they happened
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o perceive us, at which they parted, each sort run∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g
to their own Quarters, which were not very di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tant
from one another, so that from it they could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee each others Motions: I am sorry, said I, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attle was so soon over; they did cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f one a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other
so prettily, that I could have stood an Hour
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o see them. If you like the Sport, said the old
Man, I can soon set them at it again: With
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he takes out of his Breeches Pocket some
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oasted Roots, which he commonly carry'd about
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im to throw at 'em when he went that way,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich made them less shy of him.</P>
<P>Having broke the Roots in Bits, he lays them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lown in their sight; for they on both sides were
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeping from under the Leaves of the Trees where
they harbour'd: Then he cuts a Score of Sticks,
about the Bigness of ones Finger, and near a
Foot and an half long, and lays them over the
Bits of Roots; then we retir'd to some small Di∣stance,
and hid ourselves behind the Trees.</P>
<P>We were no sooner out of sight but that they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hastned to the Meat; the green Monkeys, having
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>
less Ground to go, were at them first, yet never
stop'd, but went on to hinder the others Approach,
who vigorously strove to gain Ground. The Strug∣gle
was hard, and the Victory often wavering; each
party alternatively gave way; at last the grey sort
kept the Advantage, and drove their Adversaries
back, who being come where the Sticks lay, imme∣diately
took them up, and charg'd their Enemies
with a fresh Courage, like a yielding Army that
has receiv'd new Forces: Thus, with their Club∣sters
in the Front, fell on their Adversaries with
such a Vigour, knocking them down like our
<HI>English</HI> Mob at an Election, so drove them back
again almost to their own Quarters.</P>
<P>In the mean time Straglers of both the kinds,
who had not join'd with the main Bodies of the
Armies, seeing the Coasts clear, and the Provisions
unguarded, unanimously fell to plunder, and qui∣etly
did eat what their Comrades fought for;
which the Combatants perceiving, left off sight∣ing,
and of one accord turn'd upon the Plunder∣ers,
who by that time having devoured the Booty,
left them the Field without contending any far∣ther.</P>
<P>The Battle being over, the old Gentleman would
have us to go on, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, said he, they should fall
to it again out of Revenge; for those Creatures
are very spiteful.</P>
<P>Having dispers'd them by our advancing, as in∣tended,
we walk'd from under the Trees, at the
Out-side, to have a better View of the Rock, which
in some places, he said, did change its Form as one
approaches it; and, as he said, being got clear
of the Trees, we saw at a distance, as it were, a
considerable Number of Buildings, and here and
there something like Steeples, which represented a
handsome City; and seemingly the Houses appeared
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
so plain, that had I not been prepossess'd of the
Illusion, I should have taken it for such; but
<HI>Alvarado</HI> and the young Fellow could not be
persuaded but what we saw were really Buildings,
and even in the Island, tho' the old Gentleman
made us stop a while, the better to observe every
thing; then bid us keep our Eyes fix'd at what
we look'd at, and go on; we perceiv'd every Parti∣cular
of what we observ'd to change its Form;
that which at first seem'd to be fronting, shew'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t self either sideways or backwards; and so of
every Object, till being come at a certain Distance,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Agreeableness of the Perspective, of a sud∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en
turn'd into its real Shape, like a Phantom,
who, whilst the visible screens that which it stands
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore, by its vanishing leaves it discover'd.</P>
<P>Being come as near the Rock as the Lake that parts
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would permit, we could discern nothing in it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat could in the least soften its Ruggedness, or
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive it a more agreeable Aspect than those that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re represented in the Pictures of Shipwrecks.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman thereupon made several
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earned Observations on the Alterations that Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tance
works upon Objects, and how easily our
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pticks may be deceiv'd, drawing from thence
his Inference, that we ought not to be too po∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive
of the Reality of what we see afar off, nor
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affirm for Truth that which we only heard
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f.</P>
<P>Having ended that Discourse, he brought us to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other side of a jetting part of the Rock;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich advancing like a Bastion of a fortified Wall,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reen'd from our Eyes a second piece of Wonder;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fine Rainbow, issuing as it were out of the
Mouth of a Giant, lying on the Rock, reaching
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite over the Lake: At the Bottom of it I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld not but stop to admire the various Colours
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
it was of, which far exceeded in Beauty and
Liveliness any I ever saw in the Skie. I present∣ly
imagin'd it proceded from the Rays of the Sun
upon some Pond or standing Water, whose Refle∣xions
did rise and meet the Top, so caus'd that
beautiful Circle. But <HI>Alvarado,</HI> who, by what he
had seen before, concluded the Island was en∣chanted,
said it was another Illusion, of which
the Place was sull, and would have gone away,
but that the old Man fell a laughing, and said
'tis a Sign you seldom enquire into natural Causes;
well, do but come a little nearer to it, and you
will sind that which you term an Illusion is
the natural Effect of all Fountains when the Sun
shines.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place it proceeded from,
it prov'd, as he said, only a Fountain, but of the
clearest and sweetest Water that ever was tasted;
but the place it did issue out of, was changed
from the Likeness of a Giant, to that of some
strange sort of Creature, which, tho' having no
particular Resemblance, yet would bear being com∣par'd
to several different things. The old Man's
Opinion was that it resembled a Whale, spurting
Water out at one Nostril: <HI>Alvarado</HI> suppos'd▪ it
was more like a Horse or a Cow, and rather the
last, there being Horns plain to be seen; for my
part I could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind no proper Similitude for it, but
that of an old ruin'd Monument, which formerly
they did build over the Heads of Springs. <HI>Ti∣mothy
Anchors,</HI> (for that was the Name of the young
Fellow that was with us) being ask'd what he could
make of it; why really, said he, nothing unless
it be an old patch'd up Pump that stands at the
end of my Mother's Court in <HI>Rosemary Lane</HI> (which
every Spring runs out of it self) which Compari∣son
made us all to laugh.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="49"/>
Thus we differ'd in our Opinions as to the
Likeness, yet agreed that was the finest Fountain
and the best Water we ever saw or drank. What
surpriz'd me most, was the Force wherewith it
sprung from the Rock that stood full five Yards
from the Place it fell on, which was another Sub∣ject
of Admiration, for certainly the Arts of Men
could not have invented nor completed a more
compact or pleasanter Bason, tho' it had been for
a Fountain to adorn a Monarch's Garden: Indeed
there was no Masons nor any expert Artists exqui∣site
Works to be seen, but a great deal of Nature's
matchless Understanding: There Regularity, Di∣mension,
and Proportion did concert to make it
useful, convenient and agreeable.</P>
<P>The Bason was very near round, about eight
Foot Diameter, a Bank around it near a Foot
high, and as broad at Top, slanting gently to the
Bottom, both inside and outside, which made a
most pleasant and uniform Bank, adorned with va∣rious
small Flowers and Herbs of divers beautiful
Colours and most fragrant Smells.</P>
<P>Having view'd with Pleasure and Amazement
such Regularity in a wild and uninhabited Place,
I walked about it as long as the time I could
stay would permit; I propos'd going, but the old
Gentleman, taking me by the Hand, stop'd me; you
have, said he, bestow'd a considerable time, observ∣ing
the Fertility of this Island; now pray allow
one Minute for Consideration; the Object you have
been admiring all this time is as wonderful and
surprizing as beautiful and pleasant; you see this
Fountain, which runs stiff and as large as your
Thumb, and therefore by Computation may be al∣low'd
to give near hundred Gallons of Water in an
Hour; now it runs Night and Day, it neither de∣creases
nor runs over its Bank, but keeps to the
<PB N="38" REF="50"/>
same Height. This, as you say, Sir, said I, is re∣ally
worth inquiring into; so I went several times
round it, searching for the Place, whereby the O∣verplus
of the Complement did expel, but could
not discover it: Come, said he, seek no more for
that which Nature has so well conceal'd; I have
spent many Hours in that Inquiry, and still re∣main
ignorant, but have found the Place out of which
it runs into a fine Fish-pond, about a Mile inland;
we will make it in our way to the Lake; we may
look at it as we go by, but can make no long
stay, so we went on.</P>
<P>Going along we came by a hollow part of the
Rock, which went in like an Alcove, with a great
many Concavities in it in Rows one above ano∣ther,
as round Nitches where Figures did stand:
Now, said the old Man, we are here; I will en∣tertain
you with an invisible Chorus of harmo∣nious
Voices, little inferior to Hautboys, Trum∣pets,
or other melodious Musick; here I twice
come and pay my Devotions each Day. <HI>Alva∣rado,</HI>
who, by what he had already seen, was pre∣possess'd
that the Island was full of Enchantments,
now was certain of it, and look'd upon that Place
in the Rock to be the Receptacle of Fiends and
evil Spirits; so would by no means stay; but takes
his leave, saying he was not very curious of su∣pernatural
Things. Supernatural, said the old
Man, you can't well call it, tho' to you it may
be very amazing; it is therefore well deserving
your Sight, I mean your hearing, the Eyes having
no share in the Entertainment; we shall only sing
a few Psalms; I'm sure there can be no harm in
that, but rather good, being a holy Exercise in
divine Worship, in which all good Souls ought
to join. That may be, said <HI>Alvarado,</HI> but I love
to see those with whom I worship: I don't think
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
my self as yet Company for Spirits; as for your
part, said <HI>Alvarado,</HI> (speaking to me) you may
do what you please, but take care your Curi∣osity
don't cost you too dear: <HI>Tim</HI> and I will wait
for you in the Boat; but pray be not too long
before you come, so having return'd the old Gen∣tleman
thanks for his kind Entertainment, they
went away, at which the good Man was much
affronted: What, said he, doth your Friends ima∣gine
I deal with Spirits! besides where did he e∣ver
hear that Devils lov'd to sing Psalms? for
here shall nothing else be sung: I would not for
the World that those admirable Ecchos, that hi∣therto
have repeated nothing but the Almighty's
Praises, should be polluted with the Sound of any
profane Words. I endeavoured to excuse their
Timerousness, saying it was not a Failing pecu∣liar
to themselves only, but to many besides:
The old Man allow'd it, attributing the cause
thereof to a very pernicious Custom Nurses have
to frighten Children, when they cry, with Buggabos
and such things to make them quiet, which fright∣ful
Ideas often make such deep Impressions on their
pueril Minds, that when they come to mature Age
it is then hardly worn out, which intimidates
many.</P>
<P>That Discourse being ended, we advanced as near
that part of the Rock as the Lake would per∣mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
which in that Place was not above seven or
eight Foot broad, so that we were within the
Concavity of the Rock: Now, said the old Man,
let us sit down on this Bank, and sing the hundred
and seventeenth Psalm. Indeed Sir, said I, I don't
know it by heart, and I have no Psalm-book about
me; well then, said he, I'll sing by my self, so
begins, but with such a clear and loud Voice,
manag'd with so much Skill and Judgment, that
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
it exceeded all the Singing I ever heard before
and was repeated by such a Number of melodious
Ecchos, that one would have believ'd there wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a hundred Voices in Chorus.</P>
<P>The Melody did so transport me, that I willingly
would have spent not only the Remainder of the
Day, but the succeeding also, the Extasy having
quite put out of my Mind the Necessity of my
going, and the Danger of delaying: But the good
Man, having sung an Evening Hymn after th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Psalm, which he said he sung every Night, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
takes me by the Hand: Now, said he, is not thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Emulation, who but would sing with such a Cho∣rus
of Choiristers as you might imagine was there
Indeed Sir, said I, this has so great Resemblance t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Relation we have given us in Holy History, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the celestial Joys the blessed do possess in Heaven
that I thought my self already there; for which
reason I would willingly end my Days here
That's impossible, says the old Gentleman, nor ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
you spend many more Moments here: I have th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Fish-pond to shew you, yet come, let's go; so
we went on about fifty Paces from thence mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
inland, we saw at a small Distance, between th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Trees, a Parcel of Fowls like Ducks, but consi∣derably
larger, flew away at our Approach, from
the Pond, as we advanc'd; he told me how h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
came by the old one that bred them, of whom
he was rob'd.</P>
<P>At length being come to the Pond, I was sur∣pris'd
at the Clearness of the Water, at the Bot∣tom
of which were like large Rubies, Emeralds,
Jacinths and other colour'd Stones; till being
come to the Brink of it, that which I took for
precious Stones prov'd to be Fishes by their swim∣ing
about, which, to my thinking, look'd like Stars
launching from Place to Place in the Sky, Hav∣ing
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>
spent several Minutes in admiring the sur∣prizing
Nature and Beauty of the Fishes, I took
notice of the Pond, which was about forty Yards
in Length, and near thirty in Breadth; its Form
was a broken Oval, sinking in and out here and
there, which made it the more agreeable; all
round it grew diverse sorts of Herbs intermix'd
with Flowers of different Colours, and here and
there a Basket on Sticks, which the old Man told
me he made and set there for his Ducks to breed
in: The Day being far spent, the old Man, after
having shew'd me the Places at one side of the
Pond wherein the Bason did empty it self, as also
the other side whereby the Pond run into the Lake,
takes me by the Hand; come, said he, I will keep
you no longer, Night comes on apace, and the
Retreat from this Island dangerous; therefore I
would have you improve the short Remains of
the Day to avoid the Dangers the Darkness of the
Night may lead you into, so let us go home, that
I may give you the Memorial I have promis'd you,
and then my Blessing and hearty Prayers for your
safe Departure and happy Arrival. So we went to
his Habitation, where he gave me a Roll of Parch∣ment;
here it is, said he, in a rough and unpo∣lite
Language; for I did not write it out of Osten∣tation
or to exert my Parts, but to keep me in
mind of the many Mercies I have receiv'd from
Heaven ever since my Youth, and to record the
wonderful Effects of Providence.</P>
<P>That if ever these Writings should have the
Luck to fall into the Hands of Men after my
Decease, they might be an Encouragement to the
Destitute, and a Comfort to the Afflicted, that he
who rightly applies himself and firmly trusts in the
Almighty, shall, at his Extremity, find Relief; and
now my Intent is in some measure answered, ex∣pecting
<PB N="42" REF="54"/>
you will revise and publish it when you
come to <HI>Old England;</HI> I must rejoin you not to
give it out as my own Dictation, but a History
taken from Heads out of my Memorial; for I have
been oblig'd to insert Particulars, and use such Ex∣pressions,
without which the Account I give of my
self would have been imperfect, and which being
related as by me, may chance to be accounted Self-flattery,
which is a Censure I would willingly a∣void.
I told him he might depend upon't, I
should always, and on all Accounts, be very ten∣der
of any thing that could in the least lessen the
Merit of the Subject, or tarnish the Lustre of the
History.</P>
<P>With that the good Man takes me in his naked
Arms, and embraces me over and and over with all
the Tenderness Words and Actions could express,
saying, with Tears in his Eyes, that my Exit was
a renewing of his past Grief, and would for a con∣siderable
time damp the Pleasures he before my
Coming did enjoy in his Solitude. Since now he
again has had the Comfort to converse with one
of his dear Countrymen, after full fifty Years be∣ing
sever'd from human Society; the Height of
his Grief having for some Moments stop'd the
Utterance of his Words, he sighing laid his Head
upon my Neck, squeezing me close into his
Arms.</P>
<P>This most tender and moving Action mov'd me
to a reciprocal Grief; never did any Man reflect
with more Reluctancy than when I parted with
that good old Man, who having recover'd in some
measure his former Firmness of Mind, his Soul
being again resign'd, we repeated our Embraces
with a mutual Affection; then I took my leave;
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he would not part with me there, he would
by all means wait on me to the Lake I was to
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>
wade over to come at the Rock, on the other
side of which the Boat waited for me; and when
I came there he would also have waded over with
me, that he might have the Satisfaction of seeing me
safe from the dangerous Rock, but I would in no
wise permit him. Thus having prevail'd upon him
to stay behind, I prepared to wade over; so after a
few more Embraces, I cross'd the Lake, and came
to my impatient Companions, who receiv'd me
with heavy Reprimands, for trusting my self so
long alone with that Necromancer; for nothing,
said they, shall ever persuade me a Man can have
such Plenty of Dainties with only the Help of
Nature; no, no, he may talk of Providence as
much as he plea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, he applies to the Black Art;
and those Voices, he calls Ecchos, are his invisi∣ble
Imps, which (if Truth be known) are often
employ'd in raising the Wind and causing Storms,
which render these Seas often so dangerous, and
it has been observ'd that few or no Ships come
near those Rocks, and escape being stav'd; for my
part I assure you I don't think my self safe whilst
within the Reach of his Enchantments; with that
he takes one of the Oars out of young <HI>Tim</HI>'s Hand,
and falls to rowing: Indeed, said <HI>Tim,</HI> as you say,
he look'd very much like a Conjurer with his
long Hair and Beard; and I believe he is a con∣juring
now; see here's bad Weather a coming; let's
make haste from those Rocks.</P>
<P>Even as he said, in short, so it happen'd; for
in a little time after the Wind did rise, and the
Sea began to be a little rough; so that I was forc'd
to take the Hitcher, and with it keep the Boat
from the Rocks where the Waves did very often
drive us; but standing out to Sea, the Wind grew
more calm, and fair for the Continent: I took one
of the Oars, and by Help of our Sail in a short
<PB N="44" REF="56"/>
time we got safe to shore, where being arriv'd
very much fatigu'd, we put up at the first Cottage
which was inhabited with an old Man and Woman,
<HI>Indians,</HI> where we dress'd our Fish, and went to Supper,
which was scarce over but I was hurry'd on board,
the Wind being tack'd about, and fair for our De∣parture.</P>
<P>We weigh'd Anchor on the seventeenth Day of
<HI>May,</HI> 1724. and stood out to Sea, and sailed South
and by East till we arrived on the 26th at <HI>Panam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
on <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> after meeting with some storm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Weather. Here we began to traffick in our way
home, for some Corn, necessary for our following
Voyage, as also Cotton, some Metals, Rosin, Gum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Pepper: Our Stay was not long here, for we
sail'd from thence on the fifth of <HI>June,</HI> the Wind
being then very favourable; but we had not sail'd
above twenty Leagues till we met with a violent
Storm which lasted for some Hours, and the
Wind blowing hard at North Norrh East, where∣in
we had the Misfortune to lose our Surgeon,
one <HI>John Davis,</HI> who being imprudently upon Deck▪
was wash'd overboard by a prodigious Wave coming
in at our Forecastle, our Ship receiv'd no Damage
in that Storm, but our Loss in Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> was very
great, and worse than if any other Man had bee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
missing on board; sor we might also call him ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Chaplain as well as Surgeon; for by his exempla∣ry
pious Life, during the time he belong'd to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ship, he might really be call'd a Divine. He was
a Man, who, as he told me, had been educated a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Hart-Hall, Oxon,</HI> in his early Days, and design'd
for the sacred Robes, but his Genius very much in∣clining
to the those most pleasant Studies, <HI>viz.</HI> Phy∣sick
and Surgery; he afterwards made them his
Practice; but meeting with some Misfortunes abo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>Mary</HI> for <HI>New England,</HI> where he liv'd till the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear 1723. when our Ship arriv'd at that Country,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t that time wanting a Surgeon; for our own died
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st at our Approach near the Continent, our Cap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain,
on Enquiry, having an excellent Character of
Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> agreed with him for our Voyage till we
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturn'd back thither again. I think it but just to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ternize his Memory in these Memoirs, and give
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im the Character which he merited.</P>
<P>He was a pious good Man, sober, just and vir∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uous,
ready to serve, but never to offend any
Man; his Morals were instructive to all that knew
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im; and his constant Exhortation (while on board
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Ship) to frequent daily Prayers was the reason
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e esteem'd him the Doctor of our Souls, as well
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Surgeon to our Bodies: Nay, what was more,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uring the time he was with us, tho' he never en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered
into sacred Orders, yet he told us he thought
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Duty to give us the best Instructions he was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apable of, for the Preservation of our Souls and
Bodies, both which were always in Danger; and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccordingly after divine Service (as I may call it)
was perform'd by him in a very solemn manner, he
would frequently discourse on the Nature and Hei∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousness
of the Sin of Man, which occasion'd the
Sufferings of Christ, on the Terrors of Hell and the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oys of Heaven, as also on the glorious Creation
of the World, setting forth the Works of Omni∣potence
in very lively Colours, telling the Advan∣tage,
Pleasure and Beauty that attended a godly
Life. Sometimes his Discourses would be on natu∣ral
Philosophy, which were extremely well deli∣ver'd;
at other times on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome of the Sciences,
most of which he well understood, and to which
we gave very great Attention, as being desirous of
such useful Knowledge; in short, his Death was
<PB N="46" REF="58"/>
greatly lamented by the Captain as well as my self,
and indeed by all the Ships Crew; for he was
a Man of a quick Thought and lively Apprehen∣sion,
had an universal Knowledge in Things, intire∣ly
free from Reservedness, but of perfect Humility
and Condescension, most agreeably entertaining in
his Conversation, and dear to all that ever knew
him.</P>
<P>Thus having given an imperfect Character of
that great Man, to whose Memory I owe so much,
I shall proceed to a further Description of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Voyage. As to the Coasts on those Seas I think
it needless to make any mention thereof, they
having been so well describ'd already by our mo∣dern
Geographers, nor is it any ways useful to my
Purpose; so that I shall intirely omit it, and on∣ly
give an Account of the Places where we traded
or touch'd at for fresh Provisions or Necessaries,
and remark what happened most worthy our No∣tice
in our Voyage home to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather proving now more favourable, I
began to peruse the Memorials of my good old
Hermit; but Oh! with what moving Sympathy did
share with him in the Multitude of his Misfortunes
during his Minor Years? nor could I less sympathize
with him in the Extasies of his hermetical Life; I
read with Pleasure and Amazement what he had
laboriously transcrib'd, being at that time doubt∣ful
whether it would ever be perused by any Mor∣tal,
where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e set forth a continued Series of Mis∣fortunes,
as if link'd together by divine Providence
(whilst he liv'd in the wise World as he call'd it)
and in this Account, during his aboad on that de∣solate
Island, denotes that the omnipotent Being
had always an immediate Direction in every Cir∣cumstance
or Point of time; astonish'd and amaz'd
I was more and more by this good Man's Precepts,
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as abandon'd the World, content to live in a de∣solate
and lonesome Island, uninhabited by any Mor∣tal
but himself, where he has had the Space of fifty
Years to reflect and contemplate on the Follies
and Misfortunes of Man, during which time his
Maxims were always his Rule of Life in every case.
Oh! may I once more see that dear old Man whose
Habitation is free from all anxious Cares, from Op∣pression
and Usury, and all the Evils that attend
this popular World, there would I abide and never
depart from that happy Solitude which he so peace∣ably
enjoys—But whether am I running—
these Contemplations has made me forget the Re∣marks
of my Voyage.</P>
<P>We sail'd from <HI>Panama</HI> on the sixth Day of <HI>June,</HI>
and had frequent Thunder and Lightning, attend∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with some Rain, but nothing else extraordinary
happened. On the fifteenth we made <HI>Gorgona-Bay</HI>
in <HI>Peru,</HI> where our Boat went on shore to a Village
on the Main, with twenty Hands well arm'd, re∣solving
to get some fresh Provisions at any Rate;
for we began to be in want, having taken in but
very little at <HI>Panama.</HI> It is a low Land, full of
Mangrove Trees, and within Land pretty high;
the Village was but poor; however they brought
away six Hogs, and four Goats, some Mines and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antins. Not far from thence are some Gold
Mines, but of no very great Note, as we were
informed by some <HI>Indians.</HI> They are a very war∣like
People that live on that Coast, who often engage
one another with Clubs and Darts made of hard
Wood. The Island is about six Leagues in Length:
There are Monkeys, Lizards, Hares and <HI>Guinea</HI>
Pigs; also several Sorts of Snakes, some of which
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as big as one's Leg; so that it is dangerous
to walk in some Parts of the Island. One of our
Men happened to be bit by one, and did not live
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
above six Hours after; tho' his Death had been pre∣vented,
I believe, had we not met with that Mis∣fortune
of losing Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> our Surgeon. Here also
we caught some Mullets, and several sorts of Fish
extreamly good, tho' unknown to us as▪ to their
Names. At this Island there is a Creature the <HI>Indians</HI>
call a <HI>Mundago,</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> a <HI>Sloth,</HI> which I
think is its properest Name; for it is a Creature
that seems to sleep as it walks by its slow Motion:
and it is reported that it eats the Leaves of Tree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which is its Food, but is so prodigious lazy, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
when it has clear'd one Tree of its Leaves, it wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
be almost starv'd to death before it attempts to
climb another; in short it is a very ugly Creature,
seeming to be of the Monkey kind by its Make, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
its Hair is thicker and longer, and he is not s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
sightly to look at, and is different in Nature
Here we also got fresh Water and Wood; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there is very good Brooks on that Island; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Wood enough. While we lay near that Island I wen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on shore, and in my Conversation with a <HI>Spaniar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose Seas: They sent their Boat with six Hands
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Island, in Search of him; they took their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peaking Trumpet with them, and by that Means,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about six Hours Stay on the Island, they found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im out: He told them, that at his first being set
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Shore upon the Island, it seem'd very melancho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and
frightful, when he began to reflect on the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arbarity of the Pirates, to leave him there without
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rovisions, or any Manner of Necessaries, whereby
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e might support himself (they leaving him only
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s wearing Cloaths, and his Pocket-Knife; had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey left any Fire-Arms and Amunition, his Case
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d not been near so desperate, because he then

but likewise have kill'd some Goats or Fowls
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r his Sustenance). He also said, what made him
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery melancholy, was to think his Habitation, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace of Abode, must be where he could have no
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umane Society, and in an Island, that he at first
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew not whether there was any Thing on it for his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bsistance, as never being on that Coast before.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the second Day of his being there, he took

he caught a young Kid, which very much

Rubbing two Sticks of Wood hard together pro∣duced
Fire; he try'd the Experiment, and by
rubbing two Pieces of Piamento Wood together
did produce him Fire (after the Manner the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
make Use of) he then made a Fire, as having
Wood enough, and broiled Part of his Goat, which
Was a delicious Meal to him. He afterwards be∣gan

he was taken from the Island, that it was some
considerable Time before that he could relish either
Drink or any other Victuals, which were dress'd on
Board the Ship. I gave the <HI>Spaniard</HI> an Account of
the Hermit, to which he gave very great Attention,
as also both Sea and Land Tortoise.</P>
<P>So having refresh'd our selves, we sailed from
hence, after a Stay of three Days only in the Bay,
having got a pretty many Goats from the Island,
and some Maize or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn. From thence
we steer'd for the <HI>Gallapagoe</HI> Islands; but in our
Passage, met with several Storms and Turnadoes,
attended with very great Rains; some of our Men
began to prove very sickly, which we fancy proceed∣ed▪
from their eating the Liver of some young Seals
they had caught, it being unhealthy. After about
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Days Sail, we met with frequent Calms: Du∣ring
this Voyage one of our <HI>Negro</HI> Women, of
which we had three on Board, being with Child,
and near her Time, was delivered of a fine Boy,
which was of a swarthy Colour, she had been on
Board us ever since we came from the <HI>Brazil's,</HI> and prov∣ed
very necessary in washing our Linen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but <HI>Juno,</HI>
for so was her Name, prov'd with Child by one of
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men whose Name was <HI>Thomas Higgins.</HI> I with
the Help of the two other <HI>Negro</HI> Women that was
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Board, perform'd the Office of a Midwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ver'd her. I had purchas'd a little Wine at
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ama,</HI> which prov'd useful to mull for <HI>Juno,</HI> to
comfort her in that Condition; also one Bottle the

Delivery, and we were really merry on that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asion. The Captain was somewhat displeas'd at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Accident, but being unwilling (in so long a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>age, attended with so many Difficulties, as we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
met with before) to inflict too weighty Punish∣ments
<PB N="52" REF="64"/>
on his Men, he only oblig'd <HI>Tom</HI> to agree,
that he should allow <HI>Diana</HI> two Pistoles, when she
went a Shore at <HI>Brazil,</HI> to take Care of the Child.
<HI>Tom</HI> readily agreed thereto, but had some Remorse
of Conscience, and began to reflect, and was really
very much concern'd, to think that the Child got
by him (tho' on a <HI>Negroe,</HI> ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she was a Woman,
and the Child in Likeness of himself, and firmly
believing that it was really begot of him, and no o∣ther
Person) should be bred in <HI>Paganism,</HI> according∣ly
he grew very dull and melancholy at the Thoughts
thereof, which he communicated to me, asking my
Advice about it; so I perswaded him to be merry,
and not cast himself down, for many such
Accidents had happen'd in the West-<HI>Indies,</HI> before
then among <HI>English</HI> Men, who never thought much
of it afterward: However, this had no Operati∣on
at all on him, he told me, whatever other Per∣sons
had been guilty of, he could not reconcile him∣self
thereunto: Finding him so very uneasie, I ac∣quainted
the Captain of it; Ay, says the Captain, is
<HI>Tom</HI> under so great a Concern about the Child's be∣ing
not to be educated in the Christian Religion? Yet
Sir, said I, and I am apprehensive that it may grow
upon him very much to his Prejudice, he is so ex∣treamly
concern'd about it; for, says I, less Things
than that I have known People to grow melancholy
(as he seems to be) and have enter'd into a State <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Lunacy, and never could be brought to their for∣mer
Senses, but have laid violent Hands on them∣selves.
As he is a very honest good natur'd Fellow
(setting aside this Slip) said, I wish some Expedi∣ent
could be found to make him easie. Well the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mr. <HI>Dorrington,</HI> says the Captain, we have the Com∣mon-Prayer

poor <HI>John Atkins,</HI> our Surgeon and Chaplain, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
could have christned the Child, and that woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

as we have no Chaplain belonging to the Ship, now
Mr. <HI>Atkins</HI> is dead, yet as we are tollerated to bu∣sy
our Dead, pray why not to christen our Living
also? it can be no Crime to do a good Action.
The Captain approv'd of what I said, so I told him,
with his Leave, I would be Chaplain, in that
Case, as well as I had been Man-midwife before:
But Sir, said I, there is an Obstacle that will hin∣der
us still. He ask'd me what that was? Why
Sir, says I, we have not Godfathers nor Godmo∣thers,
and you know, it is not accounted lawful to
perform that Ceremony, which I take it, as it's one
of the Sacraments, ought not to be perform'd, un∣less
in a decent and orderly Manner, as the Church
directs in that Case; to which the Captain answer∣ed,
Why, is there not Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> our Lieutenant? I
and he will stand Godfathers, and he shall, as he
is <HI>Clark</HI> by Name, perform the Office of Clark
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Ceremony: But Sir, says I, what must
we do for a Godmother, you know their ought to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e one, and we have no Woman on Board that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Christian? Well then, says the Captain, these
Women we have one Board, by a little Perswasion,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay be willing to be christen'd themselves, and if
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey consent, they are of Age, and therefore capa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le
of answering for themselves, by which Means,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey may become Godmothers, on Occasion, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Child: So accordingly, the Captain call'd for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bottle of Wine, and sent for <HI>Diana,</HI> one of the
<HI>Negroe</HI> Women, aged about twenty three Years:
When she came into the Cabbin, the Captain fill'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Glass of Wine, and gave it her, which, when she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad drunk, the Captain said, so <HI>Diana,</HI> 'tis to be

says the Captain, but <HI>Diana,</HI> I sent for you on an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the Captain's Advice, I read the publick Baptis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of those of riper Years, and baptiz'd her; she an∣swering
to the Questions, by the Instruction of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Captain; and we christen'd her by the Name of <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI>
which was the Name of our Ship. So soo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as the Ceremony was over, the Captain order'd <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI>
to dress the Child in as decent a Manner a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
she could, and bring it to his Cabbin: In the mea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Time we drank our Bottle of Wine. As soon a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Child was dress'd, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> brought it to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Captain, who sent for <HI>Thomas Higgins,</HI> and told him
<HI>Diana</HI> was christen'd, and that he himself and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lieutenant, was to stand Godfathers to his Son<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Godmother, and that it was to in
christen'd, and desired to know what Name should
be given to the Child; to which he answer'd his
<PB N="55" REF="67"/>
own, <HI>viz. Thomas:</HI> But I never saw such an Alterati∣on
any Man in my Life, as I immediately observ'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him; so suddenly it appear'd, that it surpris'd
us all; for he who was before dejected, even to the
greatest Degree imaginable, now appear'd fully sa∣tisfied
in his Mind, and no longer Conscience seem'd
to fly in his Face, but he became full of Mirth and Jol∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry.
So, by the Captain's Order, I christen'd the
Child in a very decent Manner; the Captain and Lieu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aet
stood Godfathers, and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Godmother.
When the Ceremony was over, the Captain said, <HI>Tom,</HI>
as this Child was begot and born, and I its Godfather,
on Board of my Ship, and as it is now a Chiristian,
I think it properly belongs to me (tho' I am not the
Father of it) to see it brought up in a Christian
Manner, which, if it please God to bless me with
Life, I will see perform'd; and not only that, but
will take Care of it, if it lives, during my Life, and
see it well educated. So the Captain order'd Half
a Goat to be roasted, and he, the Lieutenant, and I,
with <HI>Tom</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> whom he permitted on that
Occasion, supp'd at his Table, and was very merry,
which so rejoyced <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> that she, immediately
after Supper related what had happen'd to her Fel∣low
<HI>Negroe</HI> Woman, who was called <HI>Antiope,</HI> and
they both went to <HI>Juno,</HI> and told that her Son was
baptized a Christian, by the Name of <HI>Thomas.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather here was extreamly hot in the
Day Time, but cold Dews at Night, which was
very dangerous for our Men; for three died in our
Voyage to the <HI>Gallapagoes.</HI></P>
<P>As we sailed, on the twenty fifth at Night, the
Sea very much surpriz'd us, seeming as red as Blood,
which occasioned <HI>Stephen Jones,</HI> who was upon the
Watch with some others, to call us up, for they had
never seen the like before: When we came upon
Deck, we suppos'd it to be a great Quantity of
<PB N="56" REF="68"/>
Spawn of Fish, swiming on the Water, it being ve∣ry
fair. Having pass'd the Line, we made the <HI>Gal∣liapagoes</HI>
on the filth of <HI>July,</HI> where we anchor'd a∣bout
a Mile off the Shore, in a good smooth sandy
Ground: We sent our Boat on Shore for Water,
but could find none: Some of our Men began to
be sick, but none of them died, before we arriv'd a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Puna</HI> Isle in <HI>Peru,</HI> from whence we sail'd a little
Way up the River <HI>Guiaquill,</HI> where we saw many
<HI>Alligators,</HI> and sold some of our Goods; but the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Spaniards</HI> being jealous that we came as Spies, and
belong'd to some other Ships on that Coast, that
were <HI>Buckaniers.</HI> We thought best to leave that
Place, having taken in some fresh Water, and a few
Provisions, to serve us to the Isle of <HI>Lobos.</HI> We
stood out to Sea, and made the Island <HI>St. Claca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
where we anchor'd on the tenth; for that Nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
(our Ship proving crank, and sailing very heavy; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the next Morning, when we was prepairing to sail<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
we found our Ship had sprung a Lake; so that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
were oblig'd to have one Hand at the Pomp contin∣ually.
Before we had sail'd six Leagues, the Win<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
freshen'd upon us, and the Sky look'd extraordinary
black, at North-East, and mov'd towards us, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
made us take in our Topsails, and afterwards to
rief our Mainsail, and Mizen; at which Time it be∣gan
to rain, and pour'd down, as if through a Sive:
the Sea seem'd as if it had been all on Fire, by the
prodigious Thunder and Lightning. (It then being
Night,) the Elements over Head look'd most dis∣mally
black, but all round the Horizon, as red as
Blood, the Waves, that seem'd to dash against
the Clouds, by the Wind, sparkled like Lightning,
which, together with the Thunder, made a most
terrible Noise. At last, breaking in upon our Deck,
carried away one of our Anchors; and we durst
not bring our Ship to the Wind, for Fear of her
<PB N="57" REF="69"/>
Foundering, it being dangerous in a Storm to turn
a Ship backward and forward; so were obliged to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the Trough of the Sea: But the Wind and
Rain abating, we observ'd, to our great Joy, a <HI>Cor∣pus
Sanct</HI> at the Top of our Spindle: These <HI>Corpus
Sanct's</HI> are good Signs, when seen aloft, but a bad O∣men,
and denotes a great Storm, when seen on our
Decks. It is a small glimmering Light like a Star,
when aloft, but, when on the Deck, appears like a
Glow-Worm. It is the Opinion of Mariners, that
it is a Sort of a Jelly, incorporated by the Wind,
Rain, and Sea Vapours, and Air, because it is never
observ'd, unless in stormy Weather.</P>
<P>We sailed right before the Wind, which was
South-west, but were continually oblig'd to keep
Pumping, till the eighteenth Day, when we made
the Isle of <HI>Lobos,</HI> about 12 at Noon. That Night
we got well into the Harbour, and anchor'd at
twenty Fathom Water, in clean Ground, between
the two Islands. Here we resolv'd to careen our
Ship; accordingly, observing the Time of high
Water, we put her into a Cove, in the souther∣most
Island, where we hall'd her up as far as we
could on the Land, and our Carpenter and all Hands
set to work the next Day. The Island is barren,
and without fresh Water. Here we kill'd several
Seals, Sea Lyons, Boobies and Penguins, a Sea-Foul
about as big as a Duck, whose Flesh is very
ordinary Food, but their Eggs extremely good.
Here also we found a small black Fowl, that makes
Holes in the Ground to roost in at Nights, whose
Flesh is very good, and a great many Vultures and
Crows. We had careen'd our Ships, and in a
readiness to sail on the twenty sixth, and sail'd for
the Isle <HI>Fernandos,</HI> and made the middle Bay on the
seventh of <HI>August; Winter</HI> being just over there,
which contiues only two Months, <HI>viz. June</HI> and <HI>July</HI>
we have verbal Accounts here of several Men, who

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
have been lefr or cast away, and that have liv'd
sometime, and very well on this Island: Here,
we mended our Sails; there is plenty of Fish of
diverse Sorts very good, it is very pleasant on
Shore, and very healthy; so that the Men who had
been ill in our Voyage, perfectly recover'd their
Healths, for the green <HI>Piamento</HI> Trees cast a very
agreeable and refreshing healthy Smell over the
Island: Here we spent some Time in taking Wood
on Board, and likewise in laying Water up, which
is very good also, boil'd up a considerable Quanti∣ty
of Sea-Lyons, of which there is Plenty here;
we had also plenty of young Seals, which eat very
well, only their Liver is unwholesome; and at the
south End of the Island, we found some Goats, of
which we kill'd about thirty, which were excellent∣ly
good, here was also plenty of Turnips and Water-Cresses,
which did us great Service on account of
the Scurvey, and of which we gather'd a pretty
large Quantity.</P>
<P>So having refresh'd ourselves very well on this
Island, we resolv'd to steer sor <HI>Cape Verde</HI> in <HI>Chili</HI>
on the twelfth, made the Island of St. <HI>Jago,</HI> where
we anchor'd, and sent our Boat on S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here
we bought some Hogs and black Cattle (for our
Voyage round <HI>Cape Horn</HI> to the <HI>Brazils)</HI> as also
some Corn and Maize: Here the People by the
ill Usage they have formerly met with from the
<HI>French,</HI> are extremely sharp, and really dishhonest,
for if they trade with you, and cannot get the Ad∣vantage
of you that they think you would have of
them, will snatch your Goods, and run away
from you.</P>
<P>We weigh'd Anchor on the Twentieth, and
sail'd from hence round <HI>Cape Horn</HI> in 51 Degreet 15
Minuts as our Pilot inform'd me, I being only a
Merchant on Board, and therefore do not pretend
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
to take a methodical Journal, only as I promised to
give an Account of the most material Passages in
our Voyage Home. Round the <HI>Cape</HI> the Weather
favour'd us extremely, and nothing happen'd ma∣terial,
only that we were chaced by a Pyrate-Ship
for about twelve Hours on the twenty ninth,
but Night coming on, favour'd us, so that we lost
her, on the fourth of <HI>September</HI> we made <HI>Faulkland</HI>'s
Island; here we saw a great Number of Porpuses
that often leap'd out of the Water of an uncom∣mon
Sort; on the fifth, we had the Misfortune
to have one of our Men fall into the Sea, as he
was throwing the Lead, and was drown'd before
we could give him any Help: We had very brisk
Gales at south west, we sail'd and made <HI>Cape St.
Antonio</HI> near the Mouth of the River <HI>De la Plata</HI> in
<HI>Paragua,</HI> on the twenty fifth, Wind south and by
west, when we stood out to Sea, and made the
Isle of <HI>Grande</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Brazile</HI> on the twenty
ninth, we got a Pilot who conducted us into the wa∣tering
Love at the inner westermost Point of the
Island, in sounding, as we went in, we hardly met
in any Place, with less than ten Fathom Water;
the Island is about nine Leagues long, high Land,
near the Water-side, it abounds with Wood, the
Island has Monkeys and other wild Beast, plenty
of good Timber, and good Water, Oranges, and
Lemons, we had fine pleasant Weather, but ex∣tremely
hot: Here we got Beef, Mutton, Hogs,
Fowls, Sugar, Rum, Oranges and Lemons; (so that
now we did not want good Punch) during our Voy∣age
from the <HI>Galliopagos,</HI> I apply'd myself to the
Perusal of my good old Man's Memoirs, which I
took very great Delight in; and finding the whole
Series of his Minor-Years, attended with such a
Number of unaccountable Accidents hardly to be
parallel'd, I thought proper, as I design'd them to
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
be publish'd at my Arrival in <HI>England,</HI> to digest
them in a more proper manner than I found them
wrote in his Manuscript, but neither added or dimi∣nish'd,
nor did I in the least vary from what he
himself had wrote as to the Accidents of Life, on∣ly
I made some Amendments which I thought ne∣cessary:
For his Absence from <HI>England</HI> so long as
fifty Years, had occasion'd him in some manner,
not to be well acqainted with the Language as it is
now spoken, and (by his living without any Con∣versation
so great a Time) had made him in some
measure forget his own Mother-Tongue; tho' I really
think, taking that into Consideration, his Account
was very polite; yet had his Life been publish'd as
in his Memoirs, it would have appear'd very ob∣solete
and difficult to be read, tho' never so enter∣taining;
I accordingly collected all the Passages of
his first twenty eight Years together, and thought
proper to make a Book or Part by themselves, that
Part of his Life being different from his hermitical
Confinement on the Island, which at first Sight,
appear'd so full of Horrour, and nothing but a
Prospect of the most miserable Condition that could
befal him: He no sooner look'd round him, and
depending upon Providence as Supporter of the di∣stressed,
but he found almost every thing necessary for
humane Life on that small Island; and he who then
thought of nothing but immediately perishing in
the most miserablest Condition, has liv'd, by the
Help of divine Providence, in a safe and plentiful
manner, and is now so innured thereunto, that he
despises the popular World and its Vanities, also
considers its pompuous Glory to be of no more
Substance than a Shadow, and that there is no Fe∣licity
on Earth, unless in Solitude.</P>
<P>I likewise methodized his Account during his
Residence on the Island, in the former manner, and
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
made another Book or part, which with this Ac∣count
of my finding him on the Island, and my
Conference with him, completes my Design, so that
it cannot be called an imperfect Description, but com∣plete
in three Books; so I return to my Voyage.</P>
<P>In our Passage from <HI>Juan Fernandes,</HI> we saw a
Bird very large, which is called an <HI>Alcatres,</HI> they
spread their Wings from eight to ten Foot wide,
in the <HI>Braziles</HI> is a Serpent called <HI>Liboya,</HI> or the
Roe-buck Serpent, the Report of which is incredible
(in my Opinion) but affirm'd by some of the
<HI>Portuguese, viz.</HI> that there are some of them thirty
Foot long, its Body being as big as a Hogshead,
and destroys a Roe-buck at one Meal; here we traf∣fick'd
for several Sorts of Drugs, we treated the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> very civilly, who supply'd us with all
Things necessary for our Use: During our Stay
here, there arriv'd a Brigantine laden with Negroes
for the Gold-Mines; here four of our Men died,
and three run away from us, the last of which we
had Occasion to be thankful rather than sorry; for <HI>Ty∣mothy
Anchors</HI> overheard them discoursing with De∣sign
to Mutiny at our next sailing, but was doubt∣ful
whether or no they might get enough on their side
to over-power the Captain and his Party; and agreeing
among themselves, that it was a Matter very difficult
to become Masters of the Ship, and besides considering
the Hazard they run, in being punish'd after such a
severe Manner as they should be, if found out by
any means before they could accomplish their Design
or if they should fail in their Attempt, made them ra∣ther
chuse to desert from the Ship, than continue any
longer; tho' our Captain was an extraordinary good
Man, yet Rogues will be always employing their
wicked Contrivances, and neither Clemency nor
good Usage can make them perform their Duty in
their Station.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="76"/>
<HI>October</HI> the tenth, after having set <HI>Antiope,</HI> one of
our <HI>Negroe</HI> Women, on Shore, who refused to be
christned as <HI>Diana</HI> was, we came to sail, but kept
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Juno</HI> on Board the Captain resolving
she should live with him as his Servant, and by
that means would bring up <HI>Tom</HI>'s Child; we did not
meet with any thing very remarkable, but after
about twenty four Hours, easy Sail; we pass'd the
Tropick, and the next Day saw Land, we stood from
it south south west, and had close cloudy Weather
all Night, with Squalls of Rain, when Day broke we
saw the <HI>Ascention</HI> Island at about one League's distance;
about Nine a Clock we came to an Anchor: The
Sea is here very deep; the next Day we weigh'd
Anchor, and sail'd north north east till the 17th,
with a fresh Gale at west south west, we passed
the Line; the next Day happen'd an ugly Acci∣dent,
for we brought a young Bare from <HI>Mexico,</HI>
and our Men often being used to play with her, and
tease her, which prov'd very fatal to one <HI>Thad O∣bryan</HI>
an <HI>Irish</HI> Boy of about sixteen Years of Age, who
had been fretting the creature with a small Rope
which he made a Noose to, and slipt her hind Leg
in it, and so wearying her, her Blood growing
warm and enraged, by his hunting her to and fro
on the Deck, where he happen'd to slip down, and
the Bare immediately seiz'd poor <HI>Thady</HI> by the Neck,
with such Violence, that before any Body could
deliver him from her Paws, the poor Boy's Throat
was tore all to Pieces; so that he instantly died.</P>
<P>We sailed but very slowly now, as meeting with
continual Calms, and directed our Course for <HI>Cape-Verd</HI>
Islands; but on the 26th, a heavy Turnado,
attended with Lightning, which fell as if the Ele∣ment
had been on Fire; but continued only for a
small Time. Afterwards the Weather prov'd ex∣treamly
fair, the Wind being at full South, a Sail∣or
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
going up to furle the Main Top Gallant, on the
third of <HI>November,</HI> in the Morning, he saw Land,
and suppos'd it to be one of the <HI>Cape-Verd</HI> Islands,
bearing North-east, distant about seven Leagues,
smooth Water and fresh Galles. About Four a
Clock, we bore North-north-west, and went with an
easy Sail till Day-Light, and made the Island <HI>St.
Vincent,</HI> when about Nine a Clock, we anchor'd in the
Bay, in about five Fathom Water, where we rid till
next Day; and then we went to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> another,
and one of the largest of the Islands of <HI>Cape-Verd.</HI>
These Islands are called so from <HI>Cape Verd</HI> in <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI>
and are mostly inhabited by <HI>Portugueze</HI> One of
them are called <HI>Sall,</HI> it derives its Name from the
prodigious Quantity of Salt, that is naturally con∣geal'd
in Salt-ponds. There are some poor Goats
on this Island, and some wild Fowl; here are Flam∣ingoes,
a large Fowl much like a Heron, but big∣ger
and of a reddish Colour: They feed together
in muddy Ponds, or where there is little Water:
They are hard to shoot, as being very shy.</P>
<P>In St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> we traded with some of the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
for Ambergreece; but they were very fraudu∣lent,
having very much counterfeited it. Here are
some Vineyards and Plantations belonging to the
<HI>Portugueze:</HI> Here is Wine much like <HI>Madera,</HI> also
of a pale Colour and thick: The People are swarthy,
and the Inhabitants live scattering in the Vallies.</P>
<P>While we was at this Island we scrub'd our
Ship's Bottom, and dug some Wells on Shore, where
we got some Water. Here an ugly Accident had
like to have happen'd, for one of our Men going
down into the Hold with a Candle, set Fire to a
Bale of Cotton, which, by his Carlessness, had like
to have been the Loss of our Ship; but (Thanks
to God) it was discover'd by its Smother, just be∣fore
it began to blaze out; so that by immediate
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
Help we got it extinguish'd: Very soon we hoisted
it upon Deck, for fear that any of the Fire should
remain and revive again, and because we would have
it in mind for our Safety.</P>
<P>On the Eighth we went to the Isle of <HI>Mayo,</HI> ano∣ther
of <HI>Cape-Verd</HI> Islands, but made no Stay. We
saw at South-west the Island <HI>del Togo,</HI> which is re∣markable
for being a <HI>Vulcano</HI> or burning Mountain,
which issues out Flames of Fire; yet they are only
discern'd in the Night, and then are seen a great
Way at Sea: Yet there are Inhabitants on this
Island (as I have been inform'd by the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
of the Island St. <HI>Nicholas)</HI> that live at the Foot of
the Mountain, near the Sea: There is also Cocoa
Nuts, Plantins, Goats and Fowls.</P>
<P>In the Island St. <HI>Aritanio,</HI> another of the <HI>Cape-Verd</HI>
Islands, there is a Spider (as I was inform'd by
the same <HI>Portugueze)</HI> very large, that weaves its
Web between the Trees, which is so strong, that it
is difficult for a Man to get through them: Here
are also wild Asses; likewise here are Salt-Pits,
where great Quantities of Salt is naturally made by
the Sun's Heat; with which they load yearly se∣veral
Ships, and are able to sell much greater Quan∣tities
than they do, if they had but Vent for it.</P>
<P>Having dispatch'd our Affairs at the <HI>Cape-Verd</HI>
Islands, we weigh'd with the Flood, having a small
Gale at South-south-west and by South. On the
17th it began to blow, and verr'd to the South-west
and by South: That Evening we saw three Sail, at
West-north-west, bearing, as we suppos'd, for the
<HI>Canary</HI> Islands, as well as our selves. The Night
coming on, which was extreamly clear and fine,
we pass'd the Tropick about the Break of Day:
Soon after which we observ'd a North Bank lying
in the Horizon;, we provided for a Storm, which
those Clouds denote; the Wind was at North-north-west:
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
We brought our Ship under our Main-sail
and Mizon only, and ballast our Unizon, but yet
the Wind and Seas being too high for us, and every
Wave seemingly threaten'd to overwhelm us, so
that we beat up and down with only our bare Poles,
which we fear'd would break in upon our Deck, which
must have founder'd us, in case it had happen'd;
we also lower'd our Main-yard and Fore-yard down
a Port-last, as I observ'd the Sailors call'd it, that is
pretty near the Deck; and the Wind blew extreamly
fierce, so that we did not dare to loose any Head-sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at all; for if we had, they certainly would have
blown away. During the Storm it rain'd excessive
fast, which continu'd for about four Hours, when
it chang'd, and was pretty calm, and we began to get
every thing in good Order. The Wind that Even∣ing
changing to South-west, about six the next Even∣ing,
we saw the Peek of <HI>Teneriffe</HI> at about 9 Leagues
Distance: We saw some flying Fish, and a great deal

1647. His Father, <HI>Thomas Quarll,</HI>
formerly a Master-Builder, having
unfortunately ruin'd himself in Build∣ing
was at last reduc'd to work at
the laborious and mean Trade of Brick-making, his
poor Wife also was obliged to lay her Hand to the
<PB N="70" REF="84"/>
labouring Oar; so went Charing: Which sla∣vish
and confining Occupation robb'd her of the
necessary Time to attend the Fruit of her conjugal
Love, her belov'd <HI>Phil.</HI> was oblig'd (whilst she
and her poor Yoke-fellow were drudging to get him
Bread) to commit him to the Care of one kind
Neighbour or other, for a small Consideration, till
he could prattle and go alone; at which time she
put him to School to a good old Alms Woman, so
continued going till he was six Years old.</P>
<P>One Day a Neighbour, who formerly had the
Care of the Child in his Mother's Absence, having
contracted a particular Love for him, being an ex∣traordinary
pretty Child, finding him, after School,
sitting at his Father's Door, takes him by the Hand,
and leads him to his Mother, then at Work, at an
old Lady's House, in <HI>Great-Russell-Street</HI></P>
<P>The House-keeper, who was naturally fond of
Children, seeing that pretty Child, takes him up
in her Arms,, and runs up to her good old Lady,
who had just ended her accustomary private De∣votion.</P>
<P>The Child, whom the poor Woman did keep ex∣traordinary
neat and clean, beyond what could be
expected out of her small Gettings, was naturally
very handsome, being tall for his Age, and well
shap'd, his Features regular and proportion'd, his
Complexion fair, his Hair long and curling, his
Countenance mild and sprightly, his Behaviour
gentle and easy; all which Qualifications, did ren∣der
him compleately amiable, and made the old La∣dy
conceive for him an Inclination uncommon for
a Stranger's Child, and especially of so mean a
Birth.</P>
<P>Thus, having often kiss'd him, wishing he had
been her own; but why, said she, can't I do for this
lovely Creature, tho' no Kin to me by Birth? Na∣ture
<PB N="71" REF="85"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, who has endu'd him with Qualifications so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roximal and suitable to my Inclinations, has, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ympathy, made him related to me; his Mother
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave him Birth, which, without Prejudice to her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife, she could not refuse; now I'll give him Edu∣cation,
the principal and most necessary Care, where∣by
real Love can be express'd to a Child.</P>
<P>So, having given Orders that a good Shool might
be enquired after, she puts him to board to a Ma∣ster,
whose most commendable Character of instru∣cting
his Scholars, in their Duty to God and Man, as
well as in Literature, had procur'd him a consider∣able
Number of Children of uncommon Births;
there she made Account to keep him, till he was by
Years and Learning qualified for some genteel Trade,
intending to leave him in her Will forty Pounds,
to set him up, when out of his Time.</P>
<P>But now ill Fate begins to show her Averseness
to poor <HI>Phill</HI>'s Happiness; the worthy Lady dies
suddenly, and interred a few months after, to his
unspeakable Prejudice and threatning Ruine; but
watchful Providence, who had decreed him Good,
averted the apparent Evil, and only permitted some
interceptions to her Purposes should befall, the bet∣ter
to raise his Esteem of her succeeding Favours,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen sensible of them.</P>
<P>The Master, having conceiv'd a particular Love
for the Boy (whose uncommon Docility, and extra∣ordinary
Aptness in Learning, had overtaken the rest
of his School-fellows, tho' of a much longer standing)
was very much vex'd at the Thoughts of his going a∣way
to his Parents, not being in a Capacity to continue
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Schooling: Loath was he to part with the Boy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd no less disturbed to give away twelve Pounds a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear for a Boarder. His Love for the Child, whom
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had in a Manner adopted for his own, would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow and then rouse slumbering Charity, whom Self-Interest
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
too often casts asleep; Pity, said he, such
blooming Wisdom, and forward Learning, shoud
wither away for want of Cultivation. Thus, having
ponder'd a while, Love and Charity, after a long
Struggle with Interest, obtain'd the Liberty to ex∣ert
themselves, so that he be at no Expence; the old
Man concludes to give him his Learning, it his Re∣lations
only would find him in Board and other Ne∣cessaries.</P>
<P>This being concluded upon by both the Parties▪
<HI>Phill.</HI> continued coming to School, for the Space o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
four Years longer, during which Time, he mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
himself a complete Master of the Grammar, Writing,
and Arithmetick; he also made a vast Improve∣ment
in Singing, having all that Time been taugh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by a Master, who attended some Boarders thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Times a Week, who finding an extraordinary Voice,
and natural Disposition in the Boy, took a Fancy to
teach him; so that <HI>Phill.</HI> being in some Respects
qualified to attend the School, in the Nature o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

yet too young to keep the Scholars in that Awe, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is necessary in a School. The Master only gave
him his Board, till the elder Scholars left off, and
he grown bigger, intending then to allow him
Sufficiency to maintain himself, as others in that
S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation; but ill Fate still attends the poor Boy▪
The good old Man died in less than twelve Months,
and was succeeded by a superannuated Nonconfor∣mist
Minister, who having not so prosperous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
School as his Predecessor, had no Business for a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

get his Bread honesty and creditably, when she
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
should be no more able to help him, having by her
hard working and frugal living, made Shift to lay
up five Pounds, which she dedicated to that Pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Phill.</HI> who had conceiv'd a Notion that
there is a Servitude and Hardship entail'd upon that
Station, was very loath to resolve upon entering
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto it; but, as he was a very discreet Boy, nowise
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nclin'd to play, as commonly Children of his low
Birth are, seeing there was a Necessity for him to
resolve upon something. To make hs Choice the
more easy, he consults the Master's Nature and
Temper, rather than the Goodness and Profitable∣ness
of the Trade; and as there liv'd in the Neigh∣bourhood
a Locksmith, ever since he was born,
who being great with his Father, would often play
with him, when a Child, and now and then give him
Farthings to buy Fruit; he chose to be bound to
him, which was done in about a Month's Time.</P>
<P>They both agreed wonderful well, the Matter be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng
very kind and good natur'd, and the Man as di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igent
and careful; so that those Fears of meeting
with Hardship being dispersed, he chearfully work'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, without thinking the Time tedious: But, this
Happiness, altho' slight, is but of a short lasting; for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he poor Man having been bound for a Relation,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince fail'd, had all his Effects seiz'd upon, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imself thrown in Jail, and poor <HI>Phill,</HI> in a
Year's Time, oblig'd to come to his Mother a∣gain.</P>
<P>This Accident was a vast Disappointment to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy's Learning of his Trade, being oblig'd to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dle, his unfortunate Master begging he would

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Business, and set up again, so that the Lad, for

One Day, that he was playing at Leap-frog, with o∣ther
Boys, there happen'd to go by one <HI>James Turner,</HI> a
House-breaker, who taking notice of his Activity,
which much exceeded the rest, judg'd he might be
of great Use to him in the Practice of his Art; the
Meanness of his Dress, which spoke him of no con∣siderable
Family, gave him Room to hope he might
easily get him: So having stopt a while, he took
the Opportunity, that the Boy being hot with run∣ning,
and jumping, went to drink at a Pump <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard
by, he stops him by the Arm, saying, Do you
mean to kill your self Child, to go and drink <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Water, now when you are hot? come along w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h
me, and I will give thee a Draught of good Ale, y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
shall only go a short Errand for me; will you Ma∣ster?
the innocent Boy answered, I'll go your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rand,
if its not too far; so followed him to a pet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Ale-House, in a blind Alley, not far from thence,
where he commonly used; being come, he calls for
a Quart, and bids the Child take a hearty Pull;
which he did, being very dry, and the Liquor as
pleasant. This being done a second Time, it began
to creep into his Head, not being; us'd to strong
Drink; and in a little Time fell asleep, a Top of
the Bench on which he sat.</P>
<P>The Seducer thinking himself secure of him,
leaves him to take his Nap, so shuts the Door up∣on
him, charging the Folk of the House not to a∣wak
him, nor to let him go away, when awake, till
he return'd; so went to get ready the Implements
necessary to set his evil Project in Execution, having
determin'd to rob that Night a rich Merchant, in
which wicked Action he intended to make the harm∣less
Boy his chief Instrument, by putting him in at
a Hole he was to break, and then to open the Door
for him, under the Pretence that it was his Uncle,
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
who was ill natur'd, as to lock him out, if no
at Home at the Shop shutting up.</P>
<P>Having got the Tools, he return'd to the Boy,
whom he found just awake, and very uneasy to go

anger his Relations by staying out late, contrary to

<P>At the Ladies coming, the elevated Sailors, who
had been sailing on salt Water for the Space of three

Reason, so did run Head-long upon those quick
Sands, where most lost all they had before they

<HI>Quarll</HI> being off Duty, the next Day went to the
Place at the Time appointed, where he finds the
Colonel, in Company with Half a Score more
Gentlemen, who receiv'd him with more Civility
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Complisance than is commonly paid to Men
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Coat; so, having desired him to sit down a∣mongst
'em, and the Glass gone round once or twice,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Collonel having prais'd his Singing to the Com∣pany,
he was desired to complement them with a
Song, if' he pleas'd, with that he sung to the
Collonel the Night before. <HI>Quarll,</HI> having modest∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
told the Gentlemen, he wish'd that his Skill and
Voice did deserve the Honour of their Hearing, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he would do the best he could, having at their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equest drunk another Glass, sung the Song

<P>After a short Space of Time was spent in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raise of Singing, and a Talking of what engaging
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Accomplishment it is, in either Man or Woman;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of the Company holding that the Charms
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Musick, are nowise inferior to the Powers of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove; occasion'd a very agreeable Debate, there
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing in the Company a Gentleman, unfortunately
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder that Delamor, who would give Love the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upremacy over all that can affect our Mind, seeing

<P>Thus he run on, till the Company perceiving
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was beginning to be uneasy, desired <HI>Quarll</HI> to
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
sing the Gentleman a Love-Song, who spoke <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
much in its Praise; which he did, and pleas'd th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

had any Thing in the Praise of it; having also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Request answer'd, made the rest of the Company
crave a Song in the Commendation of what suite<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

for Roving, and others for a Country Life.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> being provided with such Songs, enterta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed

to do him Service; and as he was well qua∣lified

Scholars. A Gentleman in Company, having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>The Gentlemen, having given him Directio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

chang'd into his own, they every one gave h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
their Crowns a Piece; so they departed, bidd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im not fail coming there again that Day
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ev'night.</P>
<P>This unexpected but lucky Adventure, like a
sudden Surprize, unfram'd his Reason, so makes
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor <HI>Quarll</HI> over-look the only Obstacle that could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bstruct his blooming Happiness. Thus transpor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
with seeing himself Master of more Money than
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver he was worth before, and in a fair Prospect
of advancing himself, he hastens Home, and in his
Guard-Cloathes, in which he ought not to be seen
there, being a Dress obnoxious to most, and more
especially to Creditors.</P>
<P>His Landlady, who till then had been made to
expect her Money, thinking he only waited the
Ship's being discharg'd, to go another Voyage, see∣ing
him in that Hope-killing Dress, gave a Screek
as if she had seen the Devil, slanders and abuses stri∣ving
for Utterance, crowd in her foaming Mouth,
and like a rapid Torrent, which runs from a large
Extent into a narrow Channel, swells and over∣flows
her Banks; so her Passion finding her Mouth
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o small a Passage, breakes out through her Eyes:
Thus, having screek'd and roar'd a while, which
occasion'd all her Lodgers to come down; she char∣ges
poor astonish'd <HI>Quarll</HI> with Shoalls of Abuses, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he vilest and most insulting Terms, the most inve∣terate
Malice can express.</P>
<P>Thus having exhausted her Stock of Slanders,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Tongue having utter'd all the evil she could, she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et her mischievous Hands to work upon his Wife,
who being come to see the Occasion of her Screek∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng,
stood like one bereft of her Senses; so having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn her Head-Cloathes off of her Head, with Words
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uitable to the barbarous Deeds, she thrusts them
both out of Doors; which, tho' the rudest Action
that could denote the Unmercifulness of her intend∣ed
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
Revenge, was to them, at that Time, the kind∣est
Act she could perform.</P>
<P>That unexpected Treatment was no small Check
to <HI>Quarll</HI>'s chearful Disposition; but having consi∣dered,
that one Time or other he must have stood
the Shock, he rejoyces, 'tis over; so, being free from
the Care of getting her paid, he has at that Time
nothing to think of but to find another Lodging;
which being then too late to go about, he con∣cludes
to wait for Morning at a certain Celler at
<HI>Charing-Cross,</HI> which is open all Night. Going a∣long
she mildly blam'd him for his unadvis'd com∣ing
in that Dress, which he might imagin could
produce no better Effect. To which he answer'd,
He never could have wish'd for better; for by her
turning him out of Doors, she had paid her self,
which he would have done had he staid; but now
he was come away, being better provided, and in a
better Way, he would have better Lodging: So told
her of the Adventure, which much rejoic'd her;
and from that Time made her resolve to forsake her
former Way of Living, which Misfortunes only
drove her to, being not led by evil Inclination <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
many are. The Morning being come, whilst she
went to seek for Lodging, he went for the Cloathes
he was promis'd the Evening before, which hap∣pen'd
to fit him, as if made on Purpose; which
made him appear as one of the genteel Employment
he was recommended for. Being new shav'd and
powder'd, he went with the Letter, according to Or∣ders,
and was received suitably to the Recommen∣dation:
The Lady, being but just up, made him
drink Chocolate with her; then, having requir'd
a Song, she agrees with him for a Guinea a Month,
the usual Rate; and gives him a Guinea at Entrance,
as 'tis common: So did begin that very Morning,
promising to recommend him to a Lady who had
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
two Daughters, which she accordingly did, and
sent him there the next Time he came.</P>
<P>This fair Prospect of a handsome and genteel Li∣ving,
of which he always was desirous, made him
forget his past Misfortunes: Thus joyfully he re∣turns
to the Celler, where he had spent the Night
before, and where he had appointed to meet his
Wife, after that she had fix'd upon a Lodging; who
accordingly came in less than a Quarter of an Hour,
hoping she had pleased her Husband, which she re∣solv'd
for the future to endeavour; she sat down
expecting his coming, not knowing he had already
waited hers; his Change of Dress concealing him
from her, not expecting to see him in so different a
Garb, from that which she left him in; which he
perceiving, comes up to her, and takes her by the
Hand, going to ask her the Success of her Walk; but
she putting it out of his Power, in an angry Manner,
bidding him to go about his Business, having none
with her, prevented his Speaking: His Silence which
she took to proceed from Bashfulness, occasion'd her
looking him in the Face, in which discovering her
dear Husband's Features, to whose natural Hand∣someness,
his genteel Cloathes were no small Additi∣on:
She was seiz'd with such a Surprize, that it
struck her speechless for some Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> discerning her Disorder by the fading of
her fresh Complexion, was as much surpriz'd as she.
Thus trembling, he takes her in his Arms. My
Dear, said he, what's the Matter, are you not well?
Having recovered her Speech she embraceth him,
saying, how can I be ill, and my dear Heart and
Soul appear so Well.</P>
<P>These kind Words, and the Return of that Flush,
is first kindled Love's Fire in her Heart, inflames <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
a-fresh: Hardly can he govern his new-rais'd Pas∣sion,
it begins to grow abstrepolous. Thus, giving
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
her a Kiss; My Love, says he, have you got me a
Lodging? Yes, my Dear, replies the loving Wife,
you shall ever dwell in my Heart; but I want to lie
in your Arms. Answers he, that can't be done
here. Well then, said she, I have provided a fit
Place. So, having each of them taken a Dram,
they went away.</P>
<P><HI>Sally,</HI> who till then was a Stranger to real Love,
now feels its true Smart; and tho' she has for some
Time enjoy'd the Fruitions, the only Bliss, Pains-taking
Lovers aspire at, for the Reward of all their
Toils and Labours, and the happy Shore Love's
Compass points at. Yet she seems uneasy, as ex∣pecting
something more: She cavils with Time for
flying too fast. Whole Days and Nights are too
short for her to behold her Dear. She continually
bears his Image in her Heart, and wishes she could
for ever have him in her Arms, which from that
Time, she consecrates to chaste Embraces, devoting
herself wholly to the diligent and assiduous Practice
of the necessary Qualifications in a Wife, to render
a Husband truly happy: The Execution of which,
her wise and virtuous Resolutions, did gain her the
tenderest and most sincere Love and Affection, a
really fond Husband can shew or express to a dar∣ling
Wife.</P>
<P>They lived in that truly happy State about Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Year, at the End of which, cruel Fate, envious at
his uncommon Happiness, most barbarously robs
him of it, almost as soon as he had savour'd its in∣comparable
and matchless Sweets.</P>
<P>One Summer Morning, loving and truly obser∣ving
<HI>Sally,</HI> knowing her Husband delighted in
Flowers and Greens, went to <HI>Covent Garden,</HI> in Or∣der
to buy some to guarnish her Windows and
Chimney, being the only Things wanting to com∣plete
<PB N="91" REF="105"/>
the Neatness of her Lodging, which she did
keep in the greatest Order. As she was going, she
most unfortunately meet with the perjur'd Knight,
who deceiv'd her out of her Virtue, and with whom
she had liv'd a considerable Time, in Expectation of
his fulfilling the Promise he made her, when she put
him in Possession of her Maiden-Treasure; who,
being glutted with his sacrilegious Theft, most base∣ly
and ungratefully left her destitute. Fain would
she have shun'd the fatal Principle and Origin of
her past Misfortunes, and hellish Motive of her late
evil Life, which she mortally did abhore, and zea∣lously
renounc'd: But inexecrable Fate has decreed
her Ruin, she can no wise avoid him; he was too
near before she perceiv'd him, and had hold of her
Hand, e're she could shift it out of his Way.</P>
<P>Being thus suddenly stop'd by him she would
have imbrac'd the severest Death to avoid the
vile suborner, by whom her Innocence was first
betray'd, the irreconciliable Antipathy she had
conceiv'd for the mortal Enemy of her newly re∣treev'd
Vertue, being started at his terrifying Ap∣pearance
did set her whole Faculty in an uprore,
and scares away her Senses, not so much as a
Word left her to express her Trouble.</P>
<P>The amourous Knight whose late Love for the
fair <HI>Sally</HI> whose regular living had repair'd those
Charms her former lewd Life had very much
damag'd, being reviv'd and grown more passionate
than ever, flatering his Hopes with the Thoughts
that her present disorder did proceed from Joy
and Surprize, took the Opportunity of an empty
Hackney Coach that was going by, to bring her to
his Lodgings. So having stopt it, he puts the
poor dispirited Woman, altogether unsensible of
what was done or design'd: But having with the
shaking of the Coach recover'd a little Spirit;
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
finding herself so much in his Power, as aim'd at
her total ruin gave a lowd Screeck, which occasion'd
the Coach te be stop'd by some People that were
going by; but his protesting he had no other de∣sign
but to take her to a Friend's House till she
was entirely recover'd, representing also the Dan∣ger
of exposing herself by opposing his kind In∣tention.
Being then near a Street where he and
she had liv'd together a considerable time, in
some measure pacify'd her; so having put his Head
out of the Coach, he tells the People that stood
by, his Wife, who had been lately overset, was a∣fraid
of the like Accident, made her scream; so
bid the Coachman drive on, during which time he
entertains her with all the Marks of a passionate
Love, swearing over and over he was her Slave
for ever, and that now kind Fortune once more
brought 'em together none but Death shall sever
him from the Person he lov'd so dear, and that
he would expire in those soft Arms that often
gave him Life.</P>
<P>These fond Expressions she formerly had given
Credit to, are now Upbraidings and Reproaches
for her too easy a Credulity, and only encreas'd
her Hatered for the Deluder which at that time
she thought proper to conceal; thus restraining
her Passion, she assumes a feing'd Calmness, and
mildly returns him Thanks for his Love, which
she cannot indulge being marryed. Marry'd, said
he! And I living! Was you not mine? I was
indeed, reply'd she, blushing with Anger and Shame,
but what was I! I tremble to think on't, why,
said he, my Love and Heart's Delight and shall
be whilst Breath doth keep it in Motion; oh!
false Man, said she weeping most bitterly, repeat
not those deluding Words as betray'd my Virtue▪
come, said he, seace that Flood which overflows
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
my Soul with the bitterest of Sorrows, and re∣preive
the most penitent of Men from the cruellest
of Deaths; my submissive Observance to your In∣clinations
shall henceforth attone for all past
given Displeasures; mean you, said she, as you
speak? By all that's sacred I do, reply'd he, then
said <HI>Sally,</HI> joyful set me down here, and I'll for∣give
what's past. No, my Dear, this being a Re∣quest,
I cannot in Honour grant, I may without
Breach of Promise refuse, I must see you quite re∣establish'd first.</P>
<P>By this time, the Coach was arriv'd to the directed
Place, which prov'd to be a House where she had
last liv'd with the Knight; which being open, and
the Landlady at the door, oblig'd her to go in with∣out
Resistance; fearing it would be of no use, but
rather prejudicial to her Design: So she quietly
went in, hoping she should have a better Oppor∣tunity
to get away, after she had made the Land∣lady
understand she was married; but the sordid
Wretch, hoping the Knight would lodge there
again, who prov'd an extraordinary beneficial Lod∣ger
before, went out of the Room, and left her
to his Pleasure.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Sally</HI> seeing her self at the Point of being
a second time undone, there being no one to as∣sist
her within, nor Hopes of any Help from a∣broad,
the Room she was in being backwards, next
to large Gardens, and distant from the House, and
therefore out of hearing; gives herself up to De∣spair,
so seeks the Opportunity of laying hold
of his Sword, on which she did resolve to fall
rather than to y'eld to his adulterous Desires;
thus whilst the Knight was labouring to express the
height of his Love, by the most endearing Terms
and prevailing Words the most passionate Lover
could invent, she of a sudden snatch'd the Sword
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
from off his Side, and turns the Point thereof to
her Breast, in order to execute her barbarous,
tho' virtuous Resolution; what do you mean, said
he, laying hold of her Arm? To get my self at
Liberty, said she, which you basely refuse; so falls
in a violent Fit, which lasted some Minutes, and
was no sooner over but was succeeded by an other,
and so far the space of three Hours, at the End
of which time, she was so faint and weak, that
her Life was despair'd of, and so continu'd all
Day, which made the Knight repent he did force
her to stay so much against her Will heartily
wishing he knew where she did live, that he
might send her Home, which she not being sen∣sible
to tell, the Landlady, by the Knight's Orders,
got the best Room of the House fitted up for her,
so the Bed being warm'd she was carefully laid
in it and a Doctor sent for. Who, having felt
her most disorder'd Pulse, said her Indiposition
did proceed from Passion and Grief, so order'd she
might be let Blood, which would give her oppress'd
Spirits a present Relief, the Physician was no soon∣er
gone but that the Surgeon was fetcht, to per∣form
the Doctor's Orders, which gave her imme∣diate
Ease, and in a little time caus'd her to
sleep, which lasted all the Night.</P>
<P>This great and sudden Amendment much re∣joyc'd
the most afflicted Knight, who made a Vow
not to leave her till restor'd to her wonted Health,
so sat up by her all Night.</P>
<P>The next morning, <HI>Sally,</HI> whose good Night's
Rest had in a great measure recover'd both Strength
and Reason, finding herself in a strange Bed and
from her Husband, was again seiz'd with Surprise,
which did much threaten a Relapse. Heavens,
said she, by what Enchantment am I here! What
Fiends could ravish me out of my dear Spouse's
<PB N="95" REF="109"/>
Arms? then seeing the Knight stand by the Bed∣side,
she gives a loud Screek; oh! vile Ravisher,
said she, is it then by another of your Hellish
Stratagems, that I am again betray'd in your
Power? With that she fell in a violent Fit of
Crying: No, most vertuous Woman replyes the
Knight, falling on his Knees, it is by Accident, of
which I own my self to be the most miserable
Occasion, for which I heartily ask both Heaven
and you Pardon, so relates the whole Matter,
which the late Illness her excessive Grief and Pas∣sion
brought upon her, had made her forget.</P>
<P>That woful Relation did but add to her
Trouble, by hightning her Grief; oh! said she, with
a fresh Showr of Tears, how can I now look my
dear Husband in the Face when my very Justi∣fication
turns to my Shame.</P>
<P>The Knight, who was in as great a Con∣sternation
as she could be in takes her Hand,
which lay motionless out of the Bed, and bathing
on't with Tears, beggs her to forbear terrifying
his most penitent Soul; promisig to rectify all
past Wrongs: You remember, my Life, said he, the
Vows I made when first you gave your self to
me? I renew them now, and would fullfil them,
but that it would expose you to the Rigour of
the Law, therefore I'll only for the present settle
five hundred Pounds a Year upon you for your
Life, till by your Husband's Death, I am impower'd
to make you lawful Mistress of all my Estate;
pray compose your self, and sedately consider on't,
and when come to a Conclusion I'll attend for
your Answer; so withdrew for a while.</P>
<P>This generous Offer expressing the Sincerity of
his Love, for whom she formerly had more than
a common Esteam, in a great Measure appeas'd
her Passion, the offer'd Attonement disarms her
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
Revenge, she now pleads for him she before did
condemn, and blames herself for the Crime she
charg'd him with; how could, I said she, think my
Virtue safe in his Hands, on whom Love has such
an ascendent, (who it self is guilty of as many
Faults as it covers) If he went away with my
Heart it was but a Breach of Trust: Besides, his Ab∣sence
whas no Flight, being occasion'd by Bu∣siness.</P>
<P>Having made these reconcilable Reflections, and
at the Point of accepting his Offer, Conscience
starts, and oppos'd her Resolution, her Husband
stands in the way rigg'd in all those engaging Qua∣lifications
which did win her Affection; this com∣ing
into her Mind, in a manner scares away her
Reason, she can't help loving both; her Love for
the Knight pleads Seniority, and that for her Hus∣band
Justice. The first is attended with Interest,
the last is prompted by Virtue; the Debate is great,
and both their Arguments strong: Reason is call'd
to decide the Matter, which having (as 'tis her Cu∣stom)
sedately weigh'd the Cause, examin'd both Ac∣cidents
and Incidents, at last seems inclinable to fa∣vour
the Love for the Knight; but Justice, who
is always in the Right, will not resign it: Peace
and Content, the only Motives worth contending
for, must be consulted, they being also cautious of
giving a rash Verdict, examin'd on which Side they
were in most Safety; and finding themselves most
screen'd from Upbraidings and Reproaches, (their
mortal Enemies) for the Knight, gave it of his
Side; So Justice, who seldom gets its due, is
forc'd to drop the Cause, and tacitely with∣draw.</P>
<P>The Knight's Offer being the softest Choice
for an easy and quiet Life, which she could not
reasonably expect with her Husband, who doubt∣less
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
would from the late Accident, conceive an ill
Opinion of her Virtue; which, altho' at that Time
blameless, she could not with Modesty vindicate:
So, having sent for the Knight, she speaks to him af∣ter
this Manner.</P>
<P>I have had so much Reason to repent my being
too credulous, by the many Vexations it has occa∣sioned
me, now, that I should upon the bare
repeating of broken Promises, expose my self to the
same, you your self could not but blame me. In∣deed
dear <HI>Sally,</HI> said the Knight, interrupting her,
I own you have sufficient Cause to question my Sin∣cerity,
but I will this Moment remove it: So that
Moment sends for a Lawyer, and makes the pro∣pos'd
Settlement; then gives Orders a Mercer
should be fetch'd for her, to take her Choice of
the most modish Silks, and then for a Silk Night-Gown,
for her to wear till her Clothes were made;
as also, for all Manner of Linnen, Shoes and Stock∣ings:
Then, having new rigg'd her from Top to
Toe, Now, said he, my Dear you are entierly mine,
give me Direction that I may send your Husband
what he can challenge as his own; so writes the
following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Least the Absence of her, who unthinkingly
gave her self to you for a Wife (tho' not at her
own Disposal, being mine before) should cause
you any further Trouble, these are to satisfy you
that I have retaken Possession of my own; so
send you back her Clothes, as being all you
can claim Right to.</P>
<CLOSER>I am yours. <SIGNED>R. S.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Having seal'd up the Letter, and bundled up the
Cloathes, a Porter was call'd, to whom Orders was
given to carry the Bundle and Letter, to the most
perplex'd and concern'd <HI>Quarll,</HI> who spent the
Night in an unspeakable Torment. A thousand
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
dismal Accidents glear'd at his alarm'd Fancy▪
which created new Racks for his tortur'd Soul. He
tumbles on his Bed, like an unmasted Ship, toss'd
about by a violent Storm; cursing the tedious
Hours, for creeping thus in the dark Night; tax∣ing
the Sun with Sloth, and Nature with Unkind∣ness.
Thus, like one bereft of his Senses, and
quite void of Reason, snarles at the whole Crea∣tion.</P>
<P>At length the long wish'd for Day, having sent
forth its Dawn, to proclaim its Approach, he starts
from off his Bed whereon he lay, as if upon Thorns,
and mad-like, runs about to inform himself of what
he dreads more than Death to know: But having
spent several Hours in diligent Enquiry after lately
befallen Accidents, without hearing of any, Jealosie
creeps in, which, in some Measure, removes his
former Fears, but no wise lessens his Pains: Thus
he returns Home as much rack'd as before.</P>
<P>Being arriv'd, he finds on his Table a Bundle and
a Letter, which his Landlady told him were brought
by a Porter. His Impatience to know the
Contents of both was equal; but the Bundle being
most surprizing to him, he precipitately opens it
first, which, finding to be every individual Part of the
Cloathes, his Wife had on the Day before, when
she went out. With the Surprize, lets it drop out
of his Hands, and like one Thunder-struck, re∣mains
speechless for several Minutes; then se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ching
a deep and heavy Sigh attended with a Shower of
Tears, he bitterly exclaims against himself for que∣stioning
the Faithfulness of that Love, of which he
now has such fatal Proofs.</P>
<P>Thus, concluding she had drown'd herself, and
that the Letter would inform him of the cause there∣of.
He takes it up, saying, O that thou hadst been a
timely Forerunner of the fatal Tidings thou art
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
Bearer of: Yet, for her dear Sake that wrote it, I'll
peruse thee, tho' thy Contents be but Racks for me,
and the most cruel Tortures that ever were or can
be invented.</P>
<P>But great was his Surprize when he found it
to come from a man, and inexpressible his Con∣fusion
at the Contents; his Senses are all in an Up∣roar;
he blames his Eyes for not seeing right; his
Apprehension for mistaking the Meaning; his blind
Love taxes his Reason with Rashness: The mi∣staken
Expressions being but Illusions proceeding
from an Oppression upon the Intellects. So lays
down the Letter, till his disturb'd Mind was better
settled; yet he cannot be easy, he must, with some
other Writing, try whether his Eyes are still de∣fective;
on which finding no Fault, he hastily takes
up the Letter again, but alas! it was the same as
before. My Judgment, said he, has been as much
wrong'd as my Love. So, after few Considerati∣ons,
calling to Mind, that as an Accident had pro∣cur'd
her to him, he ought, without Reluctancy, to
surrender her up to it again; so, having made a
Resolution never to venture any more on that un∣certain
State, which commonly promises Happi∣ness,
but often brings Sorrow; he shifts his Lodg∣ing,
and goes to live where he was unknown, the
better to pass for a Batchelor; in which free Sta∣tion
he did enjoy Peace undisturb'd, and Pleasures
uncontroll'd, for the Space of twelve Months: But
cross Fate still pursues him, he must again be fet∣ter'd,
and bear yet heavier Chains than before. A
second Mate is allotted him, who, tho' very chaste,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooms him wretch'd, being short of other Qualifi∣cations,
necessary in a Wife to make a Husband
happy.</P>
<P>This Woman had been bred up from her Infan∣cy
under the Care of Lady, whose two Daugh∣ters
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>
<HI>Quarll</HI> did teach to sing, and had liv'd with
her in Station of a Chamber-Maid, ever since she
was big enough to officiate in that Place; during
which Time, having behav'd herself to her Mistress's
Content, she gain'd her Affection, so that this good
Lady, being desirous to advance her Maid, whose
Age fitted her for Marriage, the chief Settlement for
a Woman, she cast her Eye upon her Daughters
Singing-Master, whom she thought would make her
a good Husband, having observ'd him ever since he
came to her House, to carry and behave himself ve∣ry
decently and becomingly. Thus, having decla∣red
her Mind to her, who had already a great In∣clination
that Way, readily submited to her La∣dy's
Will, who promis'd to bring it about.</P>
<P>The good Lady, having conceived the principal
Means to bring her Design about, took the Op∣portunity
of <HI>Quarl</HI>'s next coming, to propose it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
him, promising to make her worth three hundred
Pounds, which was the only Motive as could en∣gage
him to break the Resolution he had made▪
the young Woman being also very agreeable in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Person, and extraordinary obliging to him, he rea∣dily
accepted the Offer.</P>
<P>The old Lady, having so far prevail'd upon him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
resolv'd to push on till quite concluded; so has the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

in her House, where they continued but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Month. The new married Wife thinking herself
in some Measure under Confinement, whilst in the
good Lady's House, to whom Duty and Gratitude
oblig'd her to be more than indifferently observing
being likewise somewhat ambitious of Living great
she perswades her Husband to take a House at

<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
of House-keeping, which they both till then
had been Strangers to, but in little Time became
too well acquainted with.</P>
<P>The three hundred Pounds being gone in furnish∣ing
the House, and paying two Years Rent, and

<P>Her Strength decaying and the Apothecary's

grunting Companion, at least during the Summer,</P>
<P>This Proposal suiting her Ambition, to imitate
Quality, (who for the Generality did go out of
Town about that time of the Year) was soon ac∣cepted
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
of; and that Opportunity of being freed from
one of the greatest Plagues as can befal a Man,
by him as soon improv'd.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> having got her in the Mind, was nowise
dillatory to get it persotm'd; but made diligent
Enquiry about the most convenient Place in the
Country, for Remoteness and Cheapness; which
being inform'd of, he forthwith takes Horses, and
having found a good old Country-Man, with his
Wife and Daughter, in <HI>York-Shire</HI> whose diligent
Cares and frugal Living, whilst young and strong,
had been rewarded with a moderate Competence,
to keep him from- Toyling when debilitated and
waxed old; who having a pleasant and como∣dious
Habitation distant from meddling and in∣specting
Neighbours, and Room to spare; were
very glad to take in a Gentlewoman to board,
being some Company for them in their remote Li∣ving,
and therefore stood upon no Rate: which
suiting <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Circumstance and Wishes, made him
consult on means to keep his Wise there for a
Constancy; and as he well knew she never would
consent, nor he able to force her to't by Violence,
he applies to Stratagems: Thus having given
her the best Character he could to the old Peo∣ple
for good Humour, he tells them, that indeed
she had one Failing, but that it was nowise
troublesome, provided one give her her way: she
is very vapourish and looks for great Attendence.
O dear, that's Quality Distemper; well, if that be
all, reply'd the old Folk, she shall not want for
any one thing. More, said he, I must caution
you of, she will soon be tyr'd of her Lodging,
and will be for returning to <HI>London,</HI> so will seek
all Opportunity to steal away, if she finds her∣self
oppos'd in her Desires; therefore 'tis best not to
contradict her directly, but besure watch her nar∣rowly,
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
least she gives you the slip. Never fear,
reply'd the good People, we'll take care of that,
she never shall go one step alone; she is not apt
to lay violent Hands upon herself, and do her∣self
a Mischief? No, no, reply'd he, there's no
Danger of that, you may trust her alone within
Doors at any time, but never abroad: One thing more
I must give you notice of; that is, when she finds
she cannot get away, she'll be for sending Letters,
I charge you let her have no Paper, only at first,
to write to me once or twice, or, so; and that
you'll guess when proper, by her railing, which
will be a token of her being discompos'd: And
as for her Dyet, she is something dainty, but I
see you have Poutry plenty, which she loves very
well: O dear Sir, answer'd the old Woman, she
shall have both Fish, Flesh, and Fouls, when she
pleases; we have a fine Pond in the Ground well
stock'd with Fish, and Cocks and Hens enough you
see about the Yard; and for Butchers Meat, t'is
but two or three hours Ride to the next Town.</P>
<P>So <HI>Quarll</HI> having agreed, and paid one Quarter
before hand, which he promis'd to do whilst she
boarded there, he returns to <HI>London</HI> in order to
fetch his Wife, who having projected a Greatness
of Living in the Country, which she was disap∣pointed
of in Town: Immediately inquir'd into
the Appearance of the House, the Handsomeness
of the Lodgings, and Gentillity of the Neigh∣bours:
To which Questions <HI>Quarll</HI> took care to
answer suitable to her Inclination: So having con∣cluded
to go the next Day, they went out to
make Provision of such things as cannot well be
had in the Country, as <HI>Nants</HI> Brandy, Ratafie,
Usquebaugh, Coffee and Chocolate, and such things
as were necessary to entertain genteel Company.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="118"/>
Being provided with every thing, they set out
the next Day: But as neither Lodgings, House
or Neighbourhood, answer'd her Ambition, nor
his Commendations, he contriv'd to arrive in the
Night, that she might not find the Deceit, and
as the good People of the House, according to
direction, did shew her abundance of Respect, gi∣ving
her the Title of <HI>Lady;</HI> and a good Supper
being prepar'd, she enquir'd no further into the
matter. The next Morning <HI>Quarll</HI> having represen∣ted
to his Spouse, it would be of prejudice to him
if he stay'd any longer from his Scholars,
having already lost six Days, took his Leave of
her, and left her in Bed, it not being her usual
time to rise; so having promis'd to be with her
in a short Time to see how she lik'd her Lodg∣ings,
he return'd to <HI>London,</HI> having first re∣new'd
his Charge to the good People of the
House, of giving her her Humour, and, above
all, not to let her go out alone, nor consent to
her coming up to <HI>London,</HI> which in a little time
he question'd not but she would be very desirous
of.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being gone the old People, according
to their Charge, were extraordinary diligent
and careful in pleasing their new Lodger, who
finding her Ambition gratify'd by their Obser∣vance,
kept in that Day, but the next Morning
having a fancy to walk out, the young Woman
of the House took her to see the Ground and
Cattle as did belong to them, as being the prin∣cipal
Things she could shew her, there being nei∣ther
House nor Habitation, but their own little
Cottage, within sight; she, who thought her
Lodging to be in a handsome and creditable House,
near a genteel Neighbourhood, with whom she might
Converse, finding the Reverse of her Expectation,
<PB N="105" REF="119"/>
could not conceal her Passion at the Disappoint∣ment;
so falls a railing against her Husband in
such a Rage, as frightned the poor young Woman,
who doubting she was going in one of her Fits,
run Home to fetch her Father and Mother,
who being come, were as much frightned as their
Daughter at her furious Countenance, the Blood
being ready to start out of her Face, and her
Eyes out of her Head; thus fearing she would
grow obstrepulous, they each of 'em took hold of
one of her Arms, and so in a manner dragg'd
her Home, where being come they would have
laid her upon the Bed, but she who took this Act
of their Caution, for an Effect of their careful
Attendence, told them, that indeed she could not
find Fault with them, and that their Habitation
might suit their Birth; but really it did not hers,
which her Husband very well knew, and there∣fore
never would forgive him for bringing her
there, and that he should soon know; so desir'd
them to give her Paper and Ink, if the House
could affor'd such a thing.</P>
<P>The good People, who had been caution'd to give
her her Humour in that at the Beginning, having
none at home, sent the Boy that attended their
Sheep on Horse-back to the next Town for some;
then leaving her to compose her self, they retir'd
to bewail among themselves her Misfortune, which
they perceiv'd to be the Effects of Pride, reflecting
upon the Happiness of their own Condition, ànd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Pleasure of a contented Life: “<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> The Lines mark'd with (“) are set down Word for Word with his Memoirs, for these Reasons. 1. I thought it a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity to alter any thing from his Notions of the Pleasures of a Country Life. 2. And the rather because it gives us very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ively Ideas of the perfect Happiness he enjoys in his Solitude.</NOTE> Now, said
they, she has been brought up in a City where
Excess of Pleasure and Luxury are made the
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
only means to arrive at Content; but alas! how
widely do they miss their Aim! their Life is a
continued Series of Care; their Emulation and
Vanity in Fashions, Entertainments, and such
like, together with that inseparable Companion
Envy, only contribute to make an unhappy
Life still more miserable. Here this Gentlewo∣man
wants for no manner of Necessaries to make
a Life comfortable, but has rather a Superabun∣dancy,
could she reject that horrid, pain-causing
Quality of Pride, and learn a little Humility,
'tis that brings Content, and sweetens all the
Misfortunes of this Life: How preferable is our
Station to hers, how solid is the Pleasure we
enjoy in this solitary Habitation, compar'd to
the trifling Joys the Great Ones possess in the
most populous Cities! O happy Fields and
silent Groves, where nothing but eternal Rounds
of Pleasure center; here no Debauuches, Riot∣ings,
Fashions and luxurious Entertainments,
no Envy of others good Fortune, no Drunken∣ness,
swearing, and blaspheming the Mercies of
the Almighty God, ever take place as in flou∣rishing
Cities; but Providence gives us all things
with a bountiful Hand; in short, we have all
we desire, and more than we justly deserve;
here the beauteous Birds, joyfully hopping from
Bough to Bough, stretch their tuneful Throats,
and warble out melodious Anthems to their
great Creator's Praise, while flow'ry Hills in har∣monious
Echos, repeat the same to the fruitful
neighbouring Vales; here's nothing to be seen
or heard but universal Acclamations of Praise
to the Great God of all things: This is the real
solid Pleasure; this it is that makes us perfectly
happy; for how much more eligible is the
Company of irrational Animals, or even ina∣nimate
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
animate things, than the Society of Men, who
have divested themselves of all things but Shape,
whereby to distinguish them from the most defor∣med
Brutes, or indeed from more horrible De∣vils.
This Gentlewoman has put us in Mind of
our own Happiness, of which; before her Com∣ing,
we were almost ignorant; but now we may
see, that Happiness consists not in Riches, nor
Content in gaudy Apparel.—” But why do
we tarry here; it is not proper to leave the Gentle∣woman
so long alone, lest, in one of her Fits, she
should do her self a Mischief; therefore let one
of us go to her: So the good Woman of the
House went to her, and finding her in Tears, us'd
all possible Endeavours to divert her Melancholy;
but all to no purpose; for still she was interrupted
by Exclamations against <HI>That Villain! that Rogue!</HI>
her Husband: The good Woman finding that
Words could not prevail, thought a Glass of
Ratafy might do better, so desired her to comfort
her self, and take a Glass of her Cordial, to which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he soon consented, and after that four or five more,
which had the desired Effect; for her Melancholy
was by this time turn'd into most violent Fits of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Spleen, and presently into Drowsiness; the
Landlady perceiving her Condition, desir'd her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o lie down, and refresh her self by taking a little
Sleep, so laying her down upon her Bed, and
watching her to Sleep, retird.</P>
<P>After she had slept an Hour or two, she awakes
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a very splenetick Humour, and calls to know the
Reason why Pen, Ink and Paper were refus'd her,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed, said the old Woman, we did not know that
your Ladyship was awake, and we did not care
to disturb you, but I'll bring it you presently, so
went and brought it, which she no sooner receiv'd
but began to write the following Letter:</P>
<LETTER>

<OPENER>Most barbarous of Men,</OPENER>
<P>WAS you afraid that my Indisposition (for which
you most deceitfully did persuade me to
leave <HI>London</HI>) would not kill me quick enough it self,
that you have decoy'd me to an Oven, the Dulness
whereof is sufficient to make any well-bred dog pine
itself to Death; here not being a rational Creatare to
talk to, but the insipid Folk of the Hut, who being
stript of their clumzey humane Sbape, will be as com∣pleat
Brutes as their Oxen and Cows. Pray see that
you forthwith fetch me hence, or expect to incur all the
Resentment an injur'd Wife can show, as soon as arriv'd

tho' I was to travel all the way barefoot.</P>

<SIGNED>MARY QUARLL.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter being written, the good People o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the House were in a great Consternation, whether
they ought to send it or no, but after some Consul∣tation
about the Matter, they concluded it should
go, lest her Husband might take it amiss.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who expected some such Letter from
his haughty Dame, as soon as she had disco∣ver'd
the Cheat, had, with a great deal of Judg∣ment,
prepar'd the following Answer.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>
<OPENER>My Dear,</OPENER>

</LETTER>
<P>And with that one, to her Landlord and Landlady,
whom he thanked for their Care of sending the
Letter, but desired they would not trouble them∣selves
with sending any more, nor give her Op∣portunity
or Writing, seeing it did but agravate
her Distemper, and above all things to have a par∣ticular
Care she should not give them the Slip, and
he would take care to gratify them for their Trou∣ble.</P>
<P>This obliging Letter, together with a Present
of a Pair of handsome green Stockings, and Lemon
Colour Gloves to the Daughter, did so win the
old Folk's Affection, that they were extream pun∣ctual
in observing his Orders; but that to his Wife
had a quite different Success; for instead of put∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
her into Consideration, it set her in such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
violent Rage, as would scarce permit her to read

To-morrow; for I'll go and tear that Villain to pieces.</HI></P>
<P>The good Woman was not a little displeas'd to
hear her thus dispise her House, which was the
best within a Mile round; but as she imagin'd
it was the Effect of her Vapours, instead of vindi∣cating
her House, which tho' old and low-built,
was tollerable large and very convenient, she
seem'd to acquiesce with her, wishing it had been
better for her sake; but as for sending to take a
Place, it was then too late; for by that time a
Messenger could be got to Town, the Office
would be shut up; but that the next time she
went out she would take care a Place should be
taken, so excus'd it for that Week; in the mean
time she gave her her Humour, being very respect∣ful
and observing, which suiting her Pride, made
her something more easy, and in some measure di∣verted
her raving Fits, for she fully depended up∣on
going the Week following, but was again dis∣appointed
by one Mishap or other, and so from
time time to time; till at last she begen to doubt
of their giving Orders, meaning to keep her there,
thus resolv'd to go her self, but not knowing the
way she desir'd some body might be sent along
with her, which they were very ready to grant, but
never could be had, being always out of the way
about some Business or other.</P>
<P>This continuing for the Space of a Month or
more, and no News coming from <HI>London,</HI> she be∣gan
to think it was a Contrivance of her Hus∣band's
to be rid of her, with only paying for her
Board and Lodging, which she understood he had
done beforehand, and agreed so to do during her
Stay, which very probably might be for her Life;
but resolv'd to disappoint him, by privily stealing
away, and at a venture seek out the Road to the
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
next Town, not questioning but she should find
some body as she went that would direct her: But
the old Folk having been warn'd of such an En∣terprize
by her Husband, were too vigilant to give
her an Opportunity of attempting it, never leaving
her by herself from the time of her getting up to
her going to Bed again, which over Attendance
convinc'd her of her Imprisonment.</P>
<P>Thus finding her self curb'd in her Ambition,
disappointed in her Pride, and trick'd out of her
Liberty, without Hopes of being reliev'd, the Let∣ters
she sent to her Friends being intercepted, she
falls into a Passion suitable to her Case and Disposi∣tion,
which having vented upon the People of the
House for abetting and adhearing to her perfidious
Husband in so traiterous a Deed, her Spirits be∣ing
exhausted so prodigiously with raving, that no∣thing
but a Cordial Dram could ever have brought
them to their usual Tone, and which she by
long Experience knew; calls for her grand Speci∣fick,
and after she had drank three or four refreshing
Glasses, she became more easy, and retir'd to
Rest; when having slept a few Hours, she awakes
something better compos'd; thus considering, that
all the Resentment she was capable to shew could
not mend her Condition; therefore concluded to
make her Landlord and Landlady her Friends, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f she did not enjoy her Liberty as she did propose,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he might at least enjoy a little more Content in her
Confinement.</P>
<P>Thus she resolv'd, and indeed kept her Resolution
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long time, laying aside her haughty proud Tem∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,
and curbing those violent Passions she had so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong accustom'd herself to; she now began to be
much more familiar, and condescending than what
he had hitherto shewn, to the great Joy and Sur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rize
of the good People, who by this strange Al∣teration
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
were in great Hopes her Madness was wear∣ing
off; and upon that Account were extremely in∣dustrious
to humour her in every Point, using her
with all the good manners they were capable of,
which she easily perceiving, thought to make use
of their Credulity to her Advanntage; for she was
a Woman of quick Penetration, and finding how
egregiously those ignorant People had been impos'd
upon, in relation to her Frenzy, saw the only means
to regain her Liberty was to pretend a Recovery,
and accordingly, by a counterfeit Change of Tem∣per,
endeavour'd to persuade the People into a good
Opinion of her, telling them she could never requite
their extream good Services to her during her Indis∣position,
and lamenting her own Unhappiness in
being so troublesome and fatiguing to Persons of
so kind and obliging Behaviour. They in like
manner answer'd, that if their poor Services had
contributed any thing to her Ease or Recovery,
they were sufficiently made amends for all their
Trouble.</P>
<P>Now the Scene was intirely chang'd; the raving
proud, ill-natur'd Gentlewoman became the most
pleasant, sociable and best-natur'd Person they had
ever met with; and they who just before conceiv'd
so great a Dislike to her, were now so delighted
with her Company and Conversation, that she was
less alone than formerly, they always contriving
some Diversion or other to drive away her Melan∣choly,
and to prevent a Relapse, hoping to send
the welcome News of her perfect Recovery to her
Husband, frequently pleasing her with odd Country
Tales, shewing her all the Pleasures their Fields,
Gardens, and Orchards could afford, with many
other little Contrivances to pass the time away,
while she endeavour'd to divert them with the
comical Adventures of the <HI>Londoners.</HI> This she
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
endur'd almost a whole Month, with all the seem∣ing
Good-nature, imaginable; but finding her self
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n no Way to procure her Enlargement, and rather
more strictly guarded than formerly, resolv'd to
obtain her Liberty by Stratagem, which she design'd
in the following Manner.</P>
<P>There was a Servant in the House whose Name
was <HI>Thomas,</HI> a lively, brisk, fresh-colour'd young
Man, and indeed a Fellow of admirable Sense
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd good Manners. This Spark was of a very a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orous
Disposition, well vers'd in Intrigues, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xtremely obliging in his Temper and Behaviour,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho, as soon as he saw <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Wife, began to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ink of his former way of Living. Now this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oung Fellow was born in <HI>London</HI> of very mean
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arents, whose Friends not being able to give him
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trade, was oblig'd to enter himself a Member
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ancient and honourable Society of Lacqueys:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is first Service was to a Widow Gentlewoman,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here he learnt all the necessary Qualifications of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Employ, but his Mistress being a very religious
Woman, going to Church two or three times every
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, where he was oblig'd constantly to attend her,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d so much Gravity not suiting his mercurial
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emper, soon oblig'd him to quit his Post. But
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being an Arch Wag and sly Knave, soon ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nc'd
himself to be Footman to a young No∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man.
Here he began to shew his Genius; for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Master being a young Gentleman very much
lighted with Love-Adventures, frequently made
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of him in those Cases; and finding him to be
a sharp, ready Wit, very careful, and well skill'd
Taciturnity, soon made him secret Messenger in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dinary to all his Intrigues, in which Station he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>av'd himself admirably well, having all the Ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mplishments
necessary for so weighty a Trust,
Vigilance, Dispatch and Secrecy, and these so
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
well manag'd that he seldom fail'd in his Designs:
This Post of Honour he enjoy'd a long time, with
great Credit and Reputation, and gain'd so great a
Share in his Master's Affections, that he likewise
made him first Minister to all his Affairs.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Tom</HI> is arriv'd to the very Summit of his
Fortune, regaling himself in all kind of Pleasure,
belov'd and trusted by his Master, honour'd and
respectd by his Fellow Servants, and, in short,
might be said to be perfectly happy. But he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that Jilt, which so long flatter'd him with h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
kind Embraces, at one fatal Blow, removes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

from the losty Precipice, to the deepest Sink <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Poverty imaginable.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI>'s Master, being Lover of Variety, his C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣riosity
prompted him to see the Diversion of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Country Wake, in order to start some fresh Gam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and to that purpose disguises himself like a pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

Wake was kept, was about ten Miles from the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bleman's

Cudgel-Players, with batter'd Ribs, fighting for

<P>After they had walk'd up and down the Field,

Mischief was, the Nobleman had got the Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

caus'd such a secret Envy in his Breast, that it be

<P>Now the Dance was begun with great F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

the Fellows pulling and hauling, and shoving, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
kissing, and tumbling, like so many mad Devil
while <HI>Tom</HI> and his Master, being Strangers to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kind

the Biter; and as soon as the Nobleman depart∣ed,
began to attack the Fortifications with all the
Artillery Wine and soft Words could supply him
with: But the Defendant, Proof to Battery, of
this kind, held out nobly a long time and mov'd
strongly for a Cessation of Arms, desiring leave
to go home: But <HI>Tom,</HI> acquainted with the va∣rious
Turns of Intrigues, resolv'd not to loose his
Game, being well assur'd he should bring her to
Articles in a little time, and begun a fresh At∣tack,
which lasted so long, that she was oblig'd
to cry for Quarters; but it being too late for
going home, <HI>Tom</HI> persuaded her to lie there, as∣suring
her that he would see her well provided
for; and so, in short, she blushingly consent∣ed.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>Tom,</HI> having gain'd his Point, orders a
Bed to be got ready, and then desired his Mis∣triss,
who was, by this time, much overcome with
Wine and sleep, to go to Bed: The poor Girl,
(still betwixt Doubt and Fear) knew not what to
say, but trembling denies what her Loocks desir'd;
and after a great many Arguments on both sides
she resigns herself intirely to him. The sly Knave,
Joyful of his Prey, conducts his Mistriss to Bed;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut as they were going the old crafty Inkeeper
cries, in mere form, I hope, Sir, that's your Wife;
for I would by no means have any thing dis∣honest
done in my House. Yes, yes, (says our
Rogue,) you may assure your self it is my Wife,
or else I should not have offer'd to go to Bed
with her; while the poor Girl, hiding her Face,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an up Stairs as fast as she could.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="134"/>
They had not been long above, when the No∣bleman,
uneasy at their Delay, returns to the
Inn and inquires after the couple he left. Why,
Sir, said the Host, they're a Bed. A Bed! says
the Nobleman a Bed! Yes, answer'd he, it being
too late to go home, they took up their Lodg∣ing
here. What! are they a Bed together! said
the Gentleman: Yes, yes, says the Innkeeper, I
left 'em together. The Nobleman, hearing this,
stood like one Thudner-struck, his Eyes darting
Lightning, and his Blood all in Flame; but bri∣dling
his Passion, very cooly inquir'd where they
lodg'd, saying he had some Business of moment to
impart to the Gentleman, and he must that Mi∣nute
speak to him. The Innkeeper, unacquainted
with his Design, very complacently conducted him
to their Apartment, and knocking at their Door,
told <HI>Tom</HI> the Gentleman was return'd, and want∣ed
to speak with him. <HI>Tom,</HI> not being yet un∣dress'd,
knowing his Master's fi'ry Temper, and
the just Resentment he was sure to meet with,
opens the Window, and out he jumps, without
saying a Word, and having bruis'd himself with
the Fall, lay sometime upon the Ground; till re∣covering
himself a little, precipitately got over
the Garden Wall, into which he had dropt from
the Window, and scours over the Fields as fast
as he could, without ever looking back.</P>
<P><HI>But having ran himself out of Breath, and think∣ing
himself out of Danger, down he sits, reflecting
upon his Melancholy Circumstances.</HI> O miserable
Wretch! <HI>says he,</HI> what have I done? How dare I
ever see my Master, who always repos'd his Trust i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
me, and I, like a perfidious Villain, to deceive him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
certain Death attends me if I go home; and if
I tarry here there's nothing but Begarry or Starving▪
I have at once lost all credit and Reputation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="121" REF="135"/>
nothing but Ruin, unavoidable Ruin. O Woman, Wo∣man!
curs'd bewitching Woman! what an infinite
number of Mischiefs are ye the Souree of? But why
do I exclaim against a Woman, so innocent, and so
charming, when I, the traiterous Deceiver, sought nothing
but her eternal Misery? O just Heaven, 'twas you that
sav'd her impending Ruin, and deservedly threw all
the fatal Effects upon my self: Well, I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll bear '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m
patiently; load me with all the Evils ye can bring,
till they mount so high, you can lay no more.
<HI>Raving and cursing in this manner, he tir'd his
Spirits, and fell asleep.</HI></P>
<P>Having slept sometime, he awakes, wond'ring
where he was: <HI>Did I dream,</HI> says he, <HI>or is it
real; no it is most certainly true; I am the most
wretched Mortal breathing; the very same Ruin I in∣tended
the poor innocent Girl, has justly fallen upon
my self; and what is become of her I know not, nor
dare I to enquire; but I hope as Heaven has hitherto
protected her, it will likewise preserve from the evil
Intents of my Master.</HI> Reflecting upon himself in
this manner, he walk'd about till Day-light, not
knowing what to do, or where to go: He was
now a great Way from <HI>London,</HI> destitute of Friends
or Acquaintance, little or no Money in his Poc∣ket,
and durst not see his Master: Despairing in
this Condition he sees a Company of Hay-makers,
going to work, it being Summer-time, and re∣solves
to make one of their Number, if possible,
hoping, by that means to keep himself from star∣ving,
and work his Passage up to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>With this Resolution he attacks the Hay-ma∣kers,
asking 'em from whence they came, and
whither they were going, which they answer'd
very civily, telling him they came from <HI>London,</HI>
and were going towards the North of <HI>England;</HI>
so being baulk'd in his Expectation, of coming
<PB N="122" REF="136"/>
to <HI>London</HI> along with 'em, he knew not what
to do; but at last resolves to go along with 'em,
hoping to meet something in his Way, that might
make his Journey pleasant; so tells them his Re∣solution
to make one amongst 'em: But they see∣ing
a Man genteely dress'd petitioning for a poor
Hay-makers Place, took him to be only in Jest,
and told him they should be glad of such a Com∣pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
if he spoke as he thought; he protested
to 'em the Sincerity of his Meaning, telling them
his Misfortunes drove him to such low Circum∣stances.
They then said they should be very glad
to serve him; and that their Master would be
in the Field by and by, and he would hire him,
for he wanted Hands; so he went with them, and
tarry'd till the old Farmer came, who finding a well
dress'd young Fellow wanting an Employment of
that Kind, ask'd him a great many Questions,
which <HI>Tom</HI> answer'd very pertinently; the Farmer
therefore taking it only as a Frolick, was willing
not to baulk him, and to hires him, telling he
might go to work that very Day if he would,
but <HI>Tom</HI> wanting a Fork told him, that as soon
as he could get his Tools in Readiness he would
come; so hires a Man to go to the next Town
to buy him one, which as soon as brought he
falls to work very pleasantly.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> went with 'em from Place to Place, con∣forming
himself to their Customs in every Point,
being a very merry Companion, and much be∣lov'd
by his Fellows: His present Life became
much pleasanter than his former, never inquir∣ing
after his Master or Country Girl, nor did he
know what was become of 'em. At last it fell to
his Lot to be hir'd by the Farmer he then work'd
for, who seeing him a tractable, brisk young
Fellow, ask'd him whether he would be his Ser∣vant,
<PB N="123" REF="137"/>
for he then wanted one; <HI>Tom,</HI> after a little
Hesitation, told him he should be glad of such
a Master, and so struck a Bargain, and let himself
for a Year.</P>
<P><HI>Tom</HI> had not been there much above half a
Year before <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Wife came down thither, who
being a genteel <HI>London</HI> Madam, reminded him of
his former Intrigues, and rais'd in him an Incli∣nation
for her; but being in so humble a Station,
he dar'd not to attack the haughty Dame, till he
might find a favourable Opportunity; and so took
all Occasions to oblige her, and was better
respected by her than any of the others, she often
saying that that Fellow had a certain <HI>Je-ne-s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai∣quoi</HI>
in his Face, which at once claim'd Love
and respect. <HI>Tom</HI> understanding this, thought
Time would certainly bring about his Purpose,
which not long after happen'd in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Tom,</HI> during her Alteration of Temper, had more
Liberty of Converse than before; and often di∣verting
her with entertaining Stories: And one
Day, being alone with her, open'd to her the
whole Series of his past Fortunes and Misfor∣tunes,
which she heard with great Attention, and
Pleasure; for <HI>Tom</HI> had never discover'd himself
before to any; but thinking to gain Credit with
this Gentlewoman, made her only privy to it.
When <HI>Tom</HI> was gone she began to reflect upon the
Fellow's Dexterity and believing him well skill'd
in all kind of Adventures, thought he might be
a fit Instrument for her Escape, and resolv'd to
advise with him about it; so accordingly the
next Day took an Opportunity to call him to her
again when she was alone, desiring him to divert
her with some of his merry Tales, telling him
she was then very Melancholy: Madam, says <HI>Tom,</HI>
I am sorry I should find you Melancholy, but
<PB N="124" REF="138"/>
I'll do what I can to please you. Ay, says she,
if you knew the Occasion of my Melancholy,
you'd pity me as well as be sorry; but you
can't be ignorant what a Prisoner I am made here,
how constantly I am attended, and scarce any
thing but Brutes to speak to; I can assure you this
Usage is enough to make me as mad as the Peo∣ple
take me to be; for I never was brought up
in this manner, which my Husband knows; it is
only a Contrivance of his to keep me here a close
Prisoner, if possible; but I'll deceive him; for if a
Woman's Invention can find any means to escape
this cursed Place, he shall be sure to see me in
<HI>London</HI> quickly, and that to his great Mortifica∣tion.</P>
<P>The sly Rogue heard her very quietly, and
thought he might now have his desir'd Ends, so
tells her she should be releas'd that very Night it
she pleas'd, and he himself would accompany her
to <HI>London,</HI> for he long'd to be there again: She
was glad to hear him say so, and ask'd by what
means he intended to convey her thence. O
Lord! says he, easy enough; I'll tell you how,
I'll take a Ladder, and set it against your Win∣dow,
and so come into your Room, and take your
Cloaths and every thing you have a mind to
send to <HI>London,</HI> and carry them to a particular
Acquaintance of mine; then I'll come back and
fetch you, and conduct you to the next Town,
which is not above five or six Miles off, and stay
there for the Stage-Coach, so both go to <HI>London</HI>
together. The Gentlewoman willing to get her
Liberty at any rate, agreed to the Proposal, only
desiring another Day to look after all her things,
and pack 'em up conveniently, because she would
not hurry herself, lest they should mistrust, and
stop her Journey.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="139"/>
<HI>Tom</HI> consented to what she said, and wish'd
for the approaching time, which being come, and
all things in Readiness, he brings the Ladder,
and mounts up towards her Room; while she as
readily delivers him, from the Window, all her
Baggage ready pack'd up; which <HI>Tom</HI> takes and
carries away, and presently returns to fetch the
Gentlewoman; who, overjoy'd to think herself freed
from that tiresome Place, gets out of Window,
and began to descend the Ladder, but, being over
eager, and not us'd to Entrepizes of that kind,
her Foot slips, and down she tumbles, Ladder and
all, which <HI>Tom</HI> seeing knew the Consequence and
ran away as fast as he could, leaving Mrs. <HI>Quarll</HI>
to get up by herself; for the Ladder in tumbling
broke the Windows where the old Farmer lay,
and made a horrid Noise, so that it scar'd the
good Man out of his Sleep; who got up to see what
was the Matter, and perceiving the Gentlewoman's
Window open, and a Fellow running cross the
Yard, cries out Murder! Thieves! Thieves! which
alarm'd the whole Family; some getting Pitch∣forks,
some Pokers, some one thing, some another,
in Order to scare the Thieves; but the old Man,
with his Fowling-piece in Hand, like a Noble
Commander lead the Van, searching all his House
over for Thieves, and to see what he had lost,
carefully looking into every Hole and Corner, not
daring to advance too fast for fear of a Surprize;
and coming to Mrs, <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Room, whose Window
he had seen open, calls to her a long time, but
hearing no Answer, fancy'd she was murther'd,
and therefore breaks open the Door, and scarches
the Room; but there was no Mrs. <HI>Quarll</HI> to be
found; they stared at one another, not knowing
what to think. However when they had examin'd
all the House, they boldly sally'd into the Yard
<PB N="126" REF="140"/>
to hunt the Thieves there, and looking about they
perciev'd something under the Ladder, which look'd
like Womens Cloaths, so taking it up, they pulls
from under it a real Woman, something like Mrs.
<HI>Quarll,</HI> and looking more narrowly perceiv'd it
to be the very same individual Person, almost
dead with the Fright and the Bruises she had
receiv'd.</P>
<P>And now their greatest Wonder was how she
came there, and their Opinions very various; the
old Man said he believ'd, that some Thieves had
gotten into the House, and to prevent her crying
had stop'd her Mouth, and threw her out of
Window. But, says another Wiseacre, how came
she to have her Cloaths on; I am sure she ought
to have been a Bed? Now, adds he, I believe
the Devil tempted her to throw herself out of
Window, and that must certainly be him you
see run cross the Yard so swiftly; thus they
disputed, a long time, but at last agreed that she
ought to be carry'd to Bed again, and have care
taken of her; and so carry'd her up Stairs, and
then went to finish their Search, while the good
old Woman and her Daughter undress'd her, and
got her to Bed, and sat up with her all that
Night.</P>
<P>After all was finish'd, the old Man, willing to
know what Quantity of Men he had lost, calls a
general Muster, and finding <HI>Tom</HI> missing, wonder'd
where he was got to, asking if he lay at home
that Night: They told him, no; but they believ'd
he was gone a Sweet-hearting: A Sweet-hearting,
says the old Fellow, well, let him be there al∣ways,
for he shall never come here again; how
do I know but he has sent the Thieves to rob me,
or that he is one of 'em himself; if he ever
comes here I'll turn him about his Business as
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>
soon as I see him. But <HI>Tom</HI> understood better
things than to come there again; for he knew
the Adventure would be blown, and then he should
be certainly discarded with Disgrace; so was re∣solv'd
to make the best of what he had got; went
away, and never was heard of again.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Quarll,</HI> as soon as come to her Speech,
confesses the whole Intrigue, and lays the Blame
upon her Husband, saying he sent her there to
be murder'd, and now he had his desir'd End,
only that she was the unhappy Cause of her own
Death. The old Man, as soon as he knew the
Matter perfectly, writes to her Husband a full
Account of the whole Story; telling him he was
in a fair way to lose his Wife, and that, if it
should so happen, he had no Occasion to send for
his Wife's Cloathes; for she had before lost them,
and tells him by what Means: <HI>Quarll,</HI> as soon as he
had read the Letter, was very much troubled at his
Wife's Folly, but resolv'd, if she recover'd, she
should tarry some time without Cloaths, which he
knew would be Punishment enough to her Pride;
so writes back to them, That they should take all
possible care to restore her to her Health, and
likewise to prevent any thing of that kind for
the future, telling them, that in a little time he
would send her some Cloaths, and make them
amends for their Trouble.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Quarll,</HI> in about a Month, began to be upon
the mending Hand, which her Husband being in∣form'd
of, resolv'd to make her stay another Month
without Cloaths, which he knew would be a
greater Punishment than the other Month of Sick∣ness;
but here he was mistaken; for it was al∣most
three Months before she perfectly recover'd,
who finding that, before that time, her Husband
had sent her some fine new Cloaths, was in great
<PB N="128" REF="142"/>
measure reconcil'd to him, and resolv'd, during
her stay there, to be much more easy in her
Mind than before.</P>
<P>The good People, whom she had often scar'd
with her outragious Passion, were very glad to see
her so calm, and took that Opportunity to repre∣sent
to her the Happiness of her Condition; being
well attended and as well provided with all Neces∣saries,
free from that Subjection she might be un∣der,
if with her Husband, whose cross and ill Hu∣mours
she would be oblig'd to bear with; be∣sides
twenty other Vexations incumbent to a marri∣ed
Life, from which she was screen'd by his being
from her.</P>
<P>The old Woman's wise Remonstances, being
back'd with the sudden Arrival of a fresh Supply
of several Sorts of choice Drams; as also, the en∣suing
Quarter's Money for her Board, and the Season
rendering the Country extreamly agreeable, made her
patiently submit to continue there till the Fall of
the Leaf; against which Time, she would contrive
some Way or other to go, if her Husband did not
come for her.</P>
<P>But <HI>Quarll,</HI> who ever since her being in the
Country, had enjoy'd the uncontroll'd Pleasures of
a single Life, having no Mind to interrupt them by
her Presence, took Care to secure her there; send∣ing
her Guardians now and then fresh Charge to
be watchful over her, and a small Present to en∣courage
them to it.</P>
<P>But surly Fate, who ever was averse to his Hap∣piness,
suggests a new Interruption thereto. <HI>Quarll,</HI>
having given over House-keeping, happen'd to
come and live at a Mantua-maker's of vast Business,
and reputed worth Money. She was a single Wo∣man,
pretty handsome, but intollerable proud and
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>
conceited, which was the Cause of her being still
unmarry'd, thinking herself too good forany Trades∣man,
or any thing below a Gentleman, which
seeing no Prospect to get, being courted by none,
she became a general Man-hater; but <HI>Quarll,</HI> who
was a handsome young Man, and of a genteel
Employ, tho' not a Gentleman, coming to lodge
at her House, reconcil'd her to the Sex in a little
Time, and made her change her Resolution never
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o marry, heartly wishing he would court her;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore, by her more than common Attendance
for a Lodger, did all she could to give him In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation,
but all to little Success; for <HI>Quarll,</HI> who
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad been already twice incumber'd in the trouble∣some
State of Matrimony, and but lately rid of
of his last Plague, had no mind to venture any
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore, so did not answer her Expectation; but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Love encreasing daily, without being taken
Notice of, she was oblig'd to declare it to an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld Gentlewoman, who lodg'd in the next Room
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him, who having doubtless been in the same
Condition, was by Experience capable to give her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvice.</P>
<P>The old Gentlewoman (as 'tis peculiar to them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen past the Sport themselves to love to pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote
it to others) took upon her the Manage∣ment
of that Affair, and from that Time watch'd

<P>Having, according to her Desire, go't him into

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m to deny; his Business slackens, and his

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows him up to his Chamber, with the joyful

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sad Confusion; yet he stay'd in the House, hoping
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he would, when cooler, consider of it, and be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econcil'd.</P>
<P>But great was his Surprise, when next Morning,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstead of his Wife's coming according to Ex∣pectation,
a Judgment is serv'd upon the Goods
of the House, at the Suit of an Upholsterer: So

to seek new Lodgings, where he continu'd
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> full Quarter without hearing of his Wife.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> hoping his Wife had left him in good
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arnest, indulges himself with the Thoughts of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing a third time deliver'd from the greatest
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncumbrance as can involve a Man, wondring how
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could so often fall into the same Snare; three
<PB N="134" REF="148"/>
Wives, said he, in three Years! and every one
equal Plagues, tho' of a different Nature! The first
a Whore, of whom I was most luckily rid by Ac∣cident;
the second a proud, lazy, indigent Crea∣ture;
she by Stratagem is secur'd, and the third
a conceited jealous Wretch; to her Ostentation I
owe my Deliverance; well, now I am once more
free, I'll take care how I hamper my self again;
so makes a strong Resolution, let what would hap∣pen
to live single from that time ever after.</P>
<P>But his Resolution, tho' never so strong, cannot
avert Fate's irrevocable Decrees; a fourth Wife
is allotted him, which will bring upon him
more Vexation and Trouble then he has yet gone
thorugh; his Peace will not only be broken and
his Ease disturb'd, but his Life must be in Jeo∣pardy.</P>
<P>One Evening that he was diverting his Collonel
and the rest of his Clubb, with his singing at the
Tavern, as he usually did once a Week, the
Landlady (who was then in Company) much
prais'd his Voice and Skill: The Gentlemen took
that Opportunity to propose a Match between
<HI>Quarll,</HI> who went for a Batchellor, and she, being
a Widdow, all the Company lik'd the Proposal,
and earnestly urg'd on the Match.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being a brisk, handsome, genteel
young Man, which Qualifications have a vast As∣cendent
upon the Sex, especially on Widdows,
made a considerable Impression upon the Hostess,
who being already above forty, was very willing
to intermix her supernumerary Years with those
of a Husband of a lesser Age; so turning to Jest
what she heartily wish'd to be in earnest, answers
in a joaking Manner, that Mr. <HI>Quarll</HI> doubtless
had, before this Time, made a better Choice so
would hardly agree to their Proposal: A better
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>
Choice, said the Gentleman! I deny that, here's
a handsome jolly Woman, a noble House, well
accustom'd, a Cellar well stockt with good Wine,
and Bags, doubtless, well fill'd with Money; I say
he cannot make a better Choice, nor shall he
make any other, so here's to its good Success;
thus drinks to her who in a joaking way puts it
about; the Glass having been round, now Mr.
<HI>Quarll</HI> said the Collonel, lets have a Love Song
to conclude the Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who thought the Gentleman had been
but in Jest, in his Heart wish'd it could turn to
earnest; the Notion of a good Establishment, and
Prospect of a considerable Advantage having blun∣derd
over those great Obstacles his present low
Circumstance and elevated Condition made him
over look, did all he could to forward what had
been propos'd; so having, according to Request given
the Landlady a Love Song, he goes and salutes
her with a hearty Kiss, who, smiling, ask'd him
whether he thought she was to be purchas'd with
a Song; to which he reply'd the Song was only
to express the Thought of his Heart, which he
offer'd to purchase her Love: Indeed, said she,
in a pleasant Manner, I don't know what your
Thoughts may be, but I never heard more agre∣able
Expressions. Well then, Widdow, said the
Gentlemen, you cannot in Gratitude and good
Manners but answer them kindly: Indeed Gen∣tleman,
said she, I can say no more but that
they are mighty pretty Words and charmingly
sung; well then, reply'd the Collonel, I'll say the
Rest for you; the Love having express'd his Pas∣sion
in so soft Terms and engaging a Way, you
cannot, without doing Violence to your good Na∣ture,
deny him what he requests in so melting
a Manner, nor shall not, I say the Word; which
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
was confirm'd by all the Company; to which she
making no Answer, it was taken for granted; so
the Marriage being concluded on, the next Day
was fix'd upon for the Performance thereof: Being
resolv'd not to adjourn till it was over, they be∣spoke
a splendid Supper and so spent the Night
merrily.</P>
<P>The Wedding was kept all the Week, during
which Time every Gentleman was profuse in his
Expences, for an Encouragement to the new
married Couple, whose Trade increas'd daily.</P>
<P>Their prosperous Beginning seem'd to promise
a happy Life, living in Love and Peace at Home,
and being in good Repute and Credit abroad; but
the same Fate as all along haunted poor <HI>Quarll,</HI> is still at his Heels; his Bliss was but a Blast:
His elop'd Wife unfortunately happ'ned to go by
as he was going out; she had him immediately
in her Eye, which as speedily convey'd him to
her Heart; the Addition, which a charming new
suit of Cloaths he then had on, made to his
natural Handsomeness, puts out of her Mind the
Cause of that Disdain she had conceiv'd for him, and
turns it into a more passionate Love than ever; she
cannot live any longer from him; she must ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
him with her at any Rate, and will not rest till
she finds out his Lodgings, from whence she re∣solves
to wash all sorrow away with her Tears, and
settle him again in her Arms; so she strait goes
to the Tavern she saw him come out of, sup∣posing
it might be a House hd did constantly use,
on purpose to inquire where he lodged.</P>
<P>The new Wife, who was then in the Bar, to
whom she did apply, perceiving in her some
Sort of Disorder, was very inquisitive to know
her Business, which the poor Woman refusing
to satisfy her withall, she told her that he did
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
live there, and that she was his Wife, and there∣fore
the fittest to know her Concern. At these
most dreadful Words she falls like one Thunder∣struck;
falling on the Ground, depriv'd of all
her Senses, and for a considerable Time lies as
tho' bereft of Life.</P>
<P>This dull Scene turns the new Wife's Passion
into Commiseration, and pities that Misfortune,
which in her Mind she before condemn'd as a
Crime; this, said she, is a true Sign of Love,
which a Harlot is it not capable of; I cannot
blame her for loving him, but rather condole her
Misfortune: So having order's fair Water and
Harts-horn Drops to be brought, gave her some in a
Glass of Water, which in a small Time fetch'd
her a little to Life, who recovering, cry'd out,
had I not been so bewitch'd as to go from him,
he would not have left me; these Words in a
moment turns the officious Condoler into a re∣vengeful
Rival, who immediately imagin'd she
had lately liv'd with him as a Mistress, and
doubtless would endeavour to do the same again;
so giving her Hand (which she kindly held be∣fore)
a scornful Toss from her, why you vile
Woman, said she, would you have him to live
for ever in Whoredom? You judge me wrong,
Madam, reply'd the poor afflicted Woman, I am his
lawful Wife, so produces her Certificate (which she
happen'd to have about her) which caus'd al∣most
as much Disorder in the Beholder, as she
herself was lately in.</P>
<P>Having recover'd her Speech, which the late
Surprise had obstructed, she ask'd, her in a violent
Passion, why she had been so base as to give him
the Opportunity to come and cheat her, by her
leaving him; for she was his Wife also: To
which she answer'd, that she could not justify
<PB N="138" REF="152"/>
her going from him, tho' indeed she had great
Provocation, he not proving the Man she took
him to be: What! reply'd she in the Bar, was
he not Man enough for you? I think you, are
very hard to please, however since the Deceit
made you leave him; why do you disturb your
self about him? he has not deceiv'd me unless
it be in having a Wife before; but as you left
him of your own Accord he had no more to do
with you; no, reply'd she in a Passion, but he
shall find, and so shall you, that I have to do
with him, so went away.</P>
<P>It being then about Noon, his usual Time to
come Home, from Market she went into a publick
House, opposite to that Tavern, there to waite his
Return, which was little after, as soon as she saw
him, she gave him a call over.</P>
<P>The sudden and unexpected Sight of the only
Obstacle to the Happiness he then did enjoy, was
most terribly shocking to him; he wish'd he had
met with Death to have miss'd of her, but to no
purpose; she had him in her Eye, and was fully re∣solv'd
to have him in her Arms er'e she went;
and as he did not come as quick at her Call as
her Impatience requir'd, she attempts to go over to
him; but <HI>Quarll,</HI> who knew her firy Temper, was
afraid she should break out in a Passion in the
Street, which would have expos'd him, and brought
it to his new Wife's Knowledge, being near Home,
so hastens over to the House she was in to prevent
her coming; and judging his Beginning to up∣braide
her with her Elopement would in some
Measure moderate her railling at him, he tells
her, as he enters the Room, I hope, Madam, you
have, by this Time, found a Man more to your
Mind: This was sufficient to provoke a milder Tem∣per
to reproach him with his adulterous Marriage,
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
of which she was too certain; hers is but a Fault,
and his a Crime; but as Reproaches are not proper
means to advance a Reconciliation, which was her
Intent, she bridles her Passion and Forces her Na∣ture
to a Submission, so throws herself at his
Feet, and falls a weeping, owning she had commit∣ted
a Fault for which she did heartly repent, and
promis'd to attone by her future Behaviour, cal∣ling
Heavens to witness her Chastity during her
most unhappy Separation.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being of a compassionate Temper was
soon made flexible by her Tears, so takes her up
by the Hand, who as soon fell into his Arms, un∣capable
of speaking for weeping; but <HI>Quarll,</HI> who
was in haste to be gone, being waited for at home,
it being about his time of Dinner, comply'd with the
poor afflicted Woman's crying and sobbing, whose
chief Request was that he would only see her home
that Time; which he presently granted, to be quit
of her, so order'd a Coach to be call'd.</P>
<P>His new Wife at home, being uneasy at his staying
beyond his Time, came to the Door to look
whether she could see him come, at that most un∣lucky
Time he was handing his other Wife into the
Coach, which she unfortunately spying, ran over,
as swift as a Hawk flies after his prey, and pulls
him back by the Lapet of his Coat as he was
stepping into the Coach after her: The Disorder this
second Surprize put him in, oblig'd him to go into
the House again he just came out of, where she im∣mediately
follow'd him, raving and railing as much
as the Provocation and her Passion did allow,
leaving in the Coath his former Wife, who, by
that second terrible Surprize, was again struck
speechless, and like one bereft of Senses.</P>
<P>The Coachman having waited some time, being
impatient, calls in the House, desiring the Gentle∣man
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
to make haste, or else to allow him for
waiting: At which the new Wife comes out in a
violent Passion, and bids him be gone, for he
was not wanted: What shall I do with the Gentle∣woman
in my Coach, said he, you had best to take
care of her she is not well, or tell me where,
I shall carry her, carry her; to the Devil, and
you will, said she, and so went in; you may carry
her, there reply'd the surly Coachman, you best
know the Way, so goes to the Coach and shakes
her till she comes to herself then taking her up
in his Arms; I am bid to carrey you to the Dievil,
said he, but I believe you are able to go there
your self, so I'll set you down here that you may
take your own Time; having set her down, then
drives away; there being a Milliner's Shop just by,
she goes in, desiring leave to sit a while till
she was able to go; she had scarce been there
three Minutes, but she sees her Husband hand∣ing
his new Wife over very complaisantly
which so exasperated her, that she fully resolv'd
upon Revenge, chusing he should be hang'd rather
than her Rival should enjoy him; so went direct∣ly
and took out a Warrant, which she im∣mediately
serv'd, so had him before a Justice of
the Peace, who committed him forthwith to <HI>New∣gate.</HI></P>
<P>The following Session happening to be extraor∣dinary
great by the vast Number of Criminals; his
Trial and several more were put off till the next,
so that he was confin'd at the Time he us'd to
bring the Money for his Wifes board in the Coun∣try;
and not daring to employ and Acquain∣tance
in that Affair, lest they should inquire into
the Occasion of his sending that Money, he desir∣ed
one, who often came to visit a Prisoner, to do
him that Favour, which he readily promis'd to
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
do, but did not perform; so that the People in
the Country, who were us'd to be paid a Quarter
before Hand, were a Quarter in Arrear, which with
their Boarder's pressing Importunity to come up
to <HI>London,</HI> made them at last resolve upon't, where
being arriv'd, they immediately inquir'd after un∣fortunate
<HI>Quarll,</HI> whose Imprisonment they soon
heard of, as also of the Cause thereof.</P>
<P>This did not a little exasperate the already
sufficiently provok'd Inquisitress, who presently
imagining, with good Reason, that his confining
her in the Country was merely for that Intent,
resolv'd to prosecute him according to the ut∣most
Rigour of the Law, wondering who that
good Person was as had him apprehended: So
went and consulted her Friends, who advis'd her
not to let her Husband know of her being in
Town till his Trial came on, and then she should
know the Prosecutor, and at her own Discretion
back the Prosecution.</P>
<P>The mean Time is first Wife who had la∣tely
been dismist, (the Knight as kept her being
not long since marryed to a vast Fortune) ha∣ving
hear'd of <HI>Quarll</HI>'s being in <HI>Newgate,</HI> went
straight to visit him; her Grief and his Surprise
at her coming, stopt for some time the Utterance
of both their Minds; at last <HI>Quarll,</HI> who had a
just Reason to tax her as the Author of his pre∣sent
Misfortune, reproach'd her with her leaving
him, which was the original Cause thereof: The in∣nocently
guilty <HI>Sally,</HI> whose Inclination, Disposi∣tion
and Resolution had been violated, related
the dismal Account of her fatal Ravishment, and
pleaded her Cause with such a prevailing Elo∣quence
as new kindled his former Love and made
him (tho' the Sufferer) give it of her Side.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="156"/>
Being thoroughly reconcil'd and having spent
some Hours in expressing both their Griefs, they at
last parted after a thousand cordial Embraces; and
as she was enabled, by the Settlement the Knight
had made upon her; she supply'd him with
Money and Necessaries, during his Confinement
in <HI>Newgate,</HI> and was with him constantly every
Day, almost from Morning till Night; and when
he was call'd upon his Tryal, she attended in
the Court, more concern'd than if she herself had
been arraign'd.</P>
<P>The Sessions being comenc'd, he was the first
as was call'd to the Bar, his Indictment being
read, he desir'd to be hear'd by his Council,
which was granted, the Deponant having prov'd
her Marriage, requir'd the Prisoner at the Bar,
should be oblig'd to live with her, or allow her
a sufficient Maintenance, as being his first Wife;
at which she whom he kept in the Country
starts up; that belongs to me, said she, I am the
first Wife, so produces her Certificate; a third Wife
appearing, startles both the Judges and the Pri∣soner,
who thought her secure.</P>
<P><HI>Sally,</HI> who till then had been silent, seeing the
Primority of Marriage so much pleaded for,
thought it may be worth her while to cliam it,
being her Right, which she might Chance turn to
the Prisoner's Advantage, so adresses to the Bench:
My Lords, said she, I did not think to apply for
Justice; but seeing these Women contending for that
which belongs to neither of them, I think my
self oblig'd, to cliam my Right; I am the first
Wife, and please your Lorships. How! a fourth
Wife and indicted but for two! said the Judges,
in a great Surprise: Why, My Lords, reply'd an
old surly Judge then upon the Bench, if Truth
be known, he has half a score, I see it in his
<PB N="143" REF="157"/>
Looks; these Smock-fac'd young Fellows are so ad∣mir'd
by the Women, that they have not the
Power to refuse any Thing; now I Warrant, if
he gets clear of this, h'ell Marry half a hun∣dred
more: <HI>Sally,</HI> who thought to do the Prisoner
Service, in taking the Priviledge of first Wife in
her own Hands, finding the Success of her good
Intent quite revers'd, heartly repented appearing,
and would have with drawn; but that the Judges
told her that she was now becom'd the Prosecu∣trix,
and was oblig'd to go on in the Prosecution;
this caus'd such a Disorder in her, who imagin'd
she should be the unfortunate Occasion of his being
cast, that she was ready to swoon. <HI>Quarll</HI> Coun∣cil,
perceiving her Disorder, imagin'd it might pro∣ceed
from a Regret of the Mischief she had done;
so put her in a Way to invalid her Deposition; now
Madam, said the Council, I very much Question whe∣ther
you can make your Assertion good; pray,
produce your Certificate, you can do us no hurt
else: <HI>Sally,</HI> overjoy'd to hear that, said she had
none; chusing to undergo the greatest Disgrace,
rather than he should come to the least Hurt: I
thought as much, said the Council: Well, well,
reply'd the surly Judge, she may have lost it;
where was you marryed Child? At <HI>Chatham,</HI> My
Lord, I think answer'd she very much discounte∣nanc'd:
At <HI>Chatham,</HI> do you say? reply'd the Coun∣cel,
I doubt yours has been a Sailor's Wedding
over a Pot of Drink; a Man's Wife till the next Voya∣ge,
and any Body's when he is gone: Your Lord∣ships
see how the Case stands; Yes, yes, answer'd
a Judge, if she is his first Wife that Way, I dare
say he is not her first Husband by many; so she
was hiss'd out of the Court. Then the Judge, addres∣sing
to the next Pretender; I hope, said he, yours will
not prove a Sailors Wedding as hers did: A Sai∣lors?
<PB N="144" REF="158"/>
No, My Lord, reply'd the second Wife, I
have Witnesses enough to mine; My Lady <HI>Fire∣brass,</HI>
with whom I did live, and her two Daugh∣ters,
saw me fairly marry'd in St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Church:
How come it, said the Judge, you did not sue
him before he marry'd the third Wife? you
would have prevented his Cheating any other poor
Woman; why, My Lord, said she, I knew nothing
on't, he kept me a Prisoner in the Country at
this good Womans House, where he decoy'd me
under the Pretence of being careful of me; I must go
into the Country for a Month or two to take the
Air; but when he had me there he could keep
me ever since, charging the People of the House
not to suffer me to come up to <HI>London,</HI> nor
yet to go out, pretending I was mad, because
I complain'd I was not well: A very pretty De∣vice,
reply'd the old Judge; yes, My Lord, cry'd
out all the Women in the Court (who where in
great Number come to hear a Trial about a Rape
committed by a Quaker upon a Maid of fifty Years
of Age) and a very bad Precedent, if not severely
punish'd: Should this be suffer'd, a poor Wife will
not dare to be out of order or complain, in Hopes
to be made much of, for fear her Husband, under
Colour of giving her the Pleasure of the Coun∣try
Air, shall when he was got her there, confine
her, and so marry whom he pleases at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The Judges, to quel their Clamour, were oblig'd
to call to them, and promise them it should be
no President, and that they might be sick at will,
and groan at their Pleasure, and also accept of
their Husbands Kindness when offer'd.</P>
<P>The Court being silenc'd, the Proceedings went
one, and several of the Judges having been spo∣ken
to by some of <HI>Quarll</HI>'s particular Friends,
who where related to some of them, they where
<PB N="145" REF="159"/>
more favourable in their Judgment, all but the
old surly Judge, with whom no Interest had been
made.</P>
<P>The three Wifes then present, having prov'd
their Marriage, the Prisoner at the Bar was ask'd,
what he had to say in his own Defence?</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who thought his Wife in the Country
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is secure from coming against him, had not gi∣ven
his Councel Instructions concerning her, so
was oblig'd to plead himself; My Lords, said he
the first Deponent against me, being run mad, and
thereby unfit for humane Society, I was oblig'd
to Think of some Retirement for her, as 'tis ne∣cessary
for People in her Case: Unfit for humane
Society! reply'd the second Wise, in a great Fury,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd was going one in the same Temper, but was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i to be silent, and he to proceed; so, My Lords,
said he, I propos'd the Country as the most plea∣ant
and wholsome Place, as also that which
suited her in Disposition best, being always am∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tious
to imitate the Quality, who commonly go
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to the Country in the Summer, which made her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccept of the Offer: There, My Lords, I boarded
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at very honest and sufficient People, in a
handsome, creditable and pleasant House: A plea∣ant
House! reply'd she, a perfect Hovel. There,
My Lords, I provided her every Thing she could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant or Desire, as her Landlady here present
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n justifie; his Councel who by what he had

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Plea out of his Hand and went on; and

I desire, My Lords, this good Woman (with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hom I have liv'd twelve Months) may be sworn
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hether she in all that Time did see or discern the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Simptoms of Madness in me: Indeed, reply'd
<PB N="146" REF="160"/>
the old Woman, I have often seen you in the
Vapours, but I cannot say I ever saw you, what
they say, raving mad but once. My Lord, said
the Prisoner, I beg this Letter, which she sent me
a Week after she was there may be read, and
then your Lordships may judge whether I do her
wrong.</P>
<P>Orders being given from the Bench, the Letter
was read. The old Woman, hearing her House so
despis'd, where a well-bred Dog would run mad,
if kept in; and then her Husband and she com∣par'd
to Oxen and Cows, was not a little displeas'd:
My House, Madam, said the old Woman, is not
so dispicable neither as that comes to, I'm sure
there's hardly a better, or more convenient, within
ten Miles round it; as for the Room you lay in,
no Gentlewoman, in her right Senses, but will be
contented with, specially in the Country; I must
be oblig'd to side with your Husband there; and
for my Husband and I to be reckon'd no better
than Brutes, you have little Reason to say so;
for no Woman can be us'd with more Humanity
than you have been; and as for your being con∣fin'd,
you never was shut up any where, but al∣ways
had the Liberty of walking about ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Ground, only indeed I would not consent yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
should trudge to <HI>London,</HI> as you often did offer
to do: The old Woman having done speaking
<HI>Quarll</HI>'s Councel put it to the Bench whether the
Prosecutrix ought to be accounted in her righ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Senses? The Judges having given their Opinion,
that she was frantick; the old Judge being displeas'd
at their Answer, ask'd them, whether a Man or Wo∣man's
being frantick (which but few in this To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
are more or less) do impower either to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
again, and if they will allow that, why did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
marry a third? the second is not not mad. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="147" REF="161"/>
second, reply'd the Councel, elop'd, My Lord,
and was from her Husband half a Year, and 'tis
to be question'd whether she would ever have
come a near him, had she not accidentally found
this Opportunity to trouble him: 'Tis a plain
Case, My Lord, said another Judge, the Pri∣soner
is guilty of the Crime he stands indicted
for, yet I don't see but that there is Room for
Favour, his Constitution perhaps may require a
Woman for the Maintenance of his Health, and
his Inclination is averse against vile Women;
besides, My Lord, wee don't hear that he did
cohabit or corespond with more than one at a
Time, and never sought a supply, till he was
destitute, in my Opinion, My Lord, he may be
favour'd a little. The ill-natur'd Judge told 'em
very surlily, that the Fact was plain, and that he
was try'd according to the Laws of his Country,
and must expect to suffer the Penalty of those
Laws; but he could see no Room for Favour,
unless His Majesty <HI>(Charles</HI> II.) would gratiously
be pleas'd to shew it him; and it was intirely
out of his own Power; so sums up the Evidences,
and refers it to the Jury.</P>
<P>The Jury went out accordingly, and after having
staid some time, brought in their Vernict <HI>Death.
Sally,</HI> who was just by, no sooner heard the ter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith being the fatal Cause of losing their Husband,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishing one another never to be reliev'd by Man,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd so parted: But <HI>Sally,</HI> as soon as recover'd,

As soon as the Keepers came in the Morning,
he calls for Pen, Ink, and Paper, which was
brought him, and wrote the following Letter to
his Colonel:</P>
<LETTER>

<P><HI>I</HI> AM now under the terrible Sentence of Condemna∣nation,

<P>As soon as he had finish'd, he delivers it to his
dear beloved <HI>Sally,</HI> and desires her to carry the

him reading very seriously, leaning upon his Hand
<PB N="149" REF="163"/>
with Tears in had Eyes, in a dull Posture: She
stood some time to look at him; but finding he ne∣ver
stir'd his Head, nor move his Eyes, she went
softly up to him, and spoke to him: He no sooner
heard her Voice but he starts; and looks just like
one awake from a Dream, and then burst into Tears,
and could not speak a Word, which <HI>Sally</HI> seeing,
could not forbear weeping, and fell about his
Neck, desiring him with all Tenderness to stop
the Torrent, for she had some joyful News to tell him;
What joyful News, says he, can you bring a Man
under my wretched Circumstances? can any thing
elevate the Mind whom Heaven itself has contriv'd
to depress? Am not I the very Out-cast and
Scorn of Providence? Have not I been unfortunate
from my Infancy? And why will you still add to
my Misery? 'tis you that now make me wretched;
Had you not so compassionately assisted me in this
my dismal Calamity with so much Tenderness, I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen should willingly have left this hateful World,
without thinking of you; but why mist I make
you the wretched Partner of my Misfortunes? 'tis
that adds to my Uneasiness. O that I had not seen
you in these my last Moments! <HI>Sally,</HI> interrupt∣ing
him, said, come, talk not of last Moments,
you may yet enjoy many happy Years; your Colo∣nel
has promiss'd to use his utmost Endeavours to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reserve your Life. I don't flatter my self with
my thing of that kind, says he; but if such a thing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onld happen, I am fnlly resolv'd not to tarry
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng in <HI>England,</HI> which has brought upon me so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any dire Mishaps.</P>
<P>The Colonel was as good as his Word; for he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Quarll</HI> extremely well; and therefore, as soon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Sally</HI> was gone, he orders his Coach to be got
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady, and away he posts to my Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> who
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad a great Influence at Court at that time, and
<PB N="150" REF="164"/>
who was his particular Friend: When he came
there, his Lordship was not stirring, so he
waited till he got up, who as soon as come
down cries out, So Colonel, what brings you here
so soon? Did you come to breakfast with me?
The Colonel, seeing him so facetious and pleasant,
told him his Message. My Lord, as soon as he
heard it, answer'd, that, upon his Honour, he
certainly would grant his Request, and made him
stay to breakfast with him.</P>
<P>As soon as Breakfast was over, he took his
Leave of his Lordship, and away he comes to
bring the Tidings to <HI>Quarll,</HI> whom he found a∣lone,
(<HI>Sally</HI> having just left him,) in much such
a Posture as she had before; the Colonel awakes
him out of his Lethargy, and told him he was
sorry to see him there, with other Compliments
usual in such Cases, and related to him the Suc∣cess
he had with my Lord <HI>Danby,</HI> so desired him
to be of good Cheer. <HI>Quarll</HI> fell at his Feet, and
express'd his Gratitude in the most thankful Terms
imaginable, telling him his Life should always be
at his Service: His Colonel, raising him up, told
him he was very well satisfy'd; and after a little
more Conversation left him.</P>
<P><HI>Sally,</HI> in the mean time, was not idle; for she
went and bought a rich Piece of Plate, and pre∣sented
it to the Recorder, that he might favour
<HI>Quarll</HI> in his Report to his Majesty, which had
the desired Effect; for when the dead Warrant
came down, he was excluded; and in a few Day<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
after my Lord <HI>Danby</HI> procur'd his Majesty's most
gracious Pardon; which his Colonel brought him
with great Joy.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> being discharch'd out of <HI>Newgate,</HI> re∣solv'd
not to tarry long in <HI>England,</HI> and told
his belov'd <HI>Sally</HI> that he must now leave her,
<PB N="151" REF="165"/>
for he had made a Vow not to tarry in <HI>Britain:</HI>
She endeavour'd to dissuade him from his Intenti∣ons;
but finding it to no Purpose, desir'd she
might accompany him: He ask'd her why she
desir'd to be wretched? telling her he was doom'd
to perpetual Misery: But she was resolutely bent
to follow him wherever he went; and accord∣ingly
sold what the Knight had settled upon her,
in order to carry the Money with her.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> hearing of a Ship bound for the <HI>South
Seas,</HI> which in her Return was to touch at <HI>Barba∣dos,</HI>
and the Captain of her having been first Mate
of the Ship to which <HI>Quaril</HI> did formerly belong,
encourag'd him to venture the Voyage, so accor∣dingly
went to the Commander in order to agree
with his about it. The Captain, after some Talk,
began to remind their former Acquaintance, but
wonder'd to see him so much alter'd as to his Con∣dition,
<HI>Quarll,</HI> being very handsomely dress'd, and
his Behaviour much better polish'd than formerly,
so desir'd him to give him an Account how this
strange Alteration had happen'd, and by what
means he came to this good Fortune. Good For∣tune!
do you call it, says <HI>Quarll,</HI> I suppose then
you look upon Men by their outward Appearance,
but did you know the World as well I do, you
would judge the contrary: Now, adds he, I'll give
you a short Account of my past Life, and then I'll
leave you to say, whether I am not rather th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per∣fect
Scorn and Mock of Fortune, so related to him
his past Misfortunes, which <HI>Quarll</HI> told in so mov∣ing
a manner, that it almost drew Tears from the
Captain's Eyes. As soon had made an end, well,
says the Captain, I thought that my way of Living
brought upon me more Troubles than Land Men
are subject to, for since I saw you I have been
shipwreck'd twice, once upon the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI>
where I lost the Ship and Cargo, and but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive Men
<PB N="152" REF="166"/>
sav'd; the other time, homeward bound from
the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> a violent Storm arose, and drove
upon the Coasts of <HI>France,</HI> where with great Diffi∣culty
we made the Bay of <HI>Biscay,</HI> and there cast
Anchor in order to refit our Ship, which was very
much damag'd in the late Storm; but about twelve
o' Clock the same Night we came there, a most
violent Hurricame blew in upon us, broke our Ca∣bles,
and drove us ashore, where again I lost the
Ship and Cargo, but all the Men sav'd: Thus I
think I have been unfortunate; but since they're
past, never think of them; we shall have a pleasant
Voyage; and as you say you have a Mind to re∣side
at <HI>Barbados,</HI> where I must touch at in my Re∣turn,
I'd have you lay out your Money in the
Woollen Manufacture, and Cutlery Ware, which
are very good Commodities in those Parts. <HI>Quarll</HI>
thank'd him for his Advice, and parted with him.</P>
<P>Away then he goes to <HI>Sally,</HI> and told her what
he had been doing, and whither he intended to
go. <HI>Sally</HI> answer'd, what was his Pleasure should
be hers, and that she would be a Partner in his
Fortunes and Misfortunes go where he would. So
<HI>Quarll</HI> went and bought the Goods which the Cap∣tain
advis'd him to, and sent them on board, and
soon after follow'd with himself and Wife.</P>
<P>They had not been long at Sea before his dar∣ling
<HI>Sally</HI> fell sick and dy'd, to his inexpressible
Grief; wishing ten thousand times he had dy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

took no Rest, and would eat no Victuals. The Cap∣tain
was afraid that he would die also, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
did all he could to divert him; but was a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>They sail'd on with a side Wind for the Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<PB N="153" REF="167"/>
in order to lie by till the Wind did serve; but
seeing themselves made upon by a Pyrate, they
were obliged to weigh their Anchor, and make
the best of their way before the Wind, in order to
avoid being taken by those Infidels, who pursu'd
them from four of a <HI>Fryday</HI> in the Morning, till
ten at Night the next <HI>Sunday,</HI> at which time there
arose a Storm, the Sky look'd very black, the Wind
being at North West, and Clouds began to rise and
move towards them, having hung all the Morning
in the Horizon, so that they took in their Top-sails,
and furl their Main-sail; the Sea run very
short, and broke in upon their Deck; however they
put right before the Wind, and sail'd so for three
Weeks, when they made Cape <HI>Horne,</HI> they had
no sooner got round the Cape, but the Wind
veer'd to the South, and it fell flat calm, which
continu'd for two Days, when the Wind sprung
up at South West, and they scudden before the
Wind very swift, and made an Island, whose
Name they none of them knew, the Ship hav∣ing
never been the Coast before; but there they
found Wood, Water, and Herbs of several Sorts,
some Seals and Sea-fowls; here they refresh'd them∣selves
for four Days, and then weigh'd Anchor,
the Wind being fair at full South, and traded at
several Ports on the Coast of <HI>Peru, Chili</HI> and
<HI>Mexico;</HI> from Port <HI>Aquapulco</HI> they sail'd, having a
brave Breeze, at North North East; they had not
sailed above one Day, before the Wind veer'd to
South West, and blew a violent Gale of Wind,
and there being a great Sea; so that their Ship
took in a great deal of Water; the Wind con∣tinuing
two Days, encreas'd to a very great
Storm, which held for one Day and two Nights
more, during which time they perceiv'd themselves
near some Rocks. The Storm rather increasing, and
<PB N="154" REF="168"/>
growing dark, they despair'd saving the Ship; and
as the Main-yard co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld not lower, the Ship's Tack∣ling
being disorder'd by the Violence of the Storm,
<HI>Quarll,</HI> being bold and active, took a Hatchet as
tumbled about the Deck, and ran up the Shrowds,
in order to cut down what stop'd the working of
the Main-yard; but, by that time he was got up,
there came a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which dash'd the Ship to Shat∣ters

<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> in a dismal Condition, remain'd the pre∣ceeding

being over-fatigu'd, lays himself down on the

the dismal Apprehensions the Effects of the late

daring to venture the Sea, which he imagin'd was
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a Caldron of Oil in a Blaze, resolv'd to try
whether he could not jump ashore; but just as he
was going to leap, he saw a horrid frightful
Monster, with glaring Eyes and open Mouth,
rush from the boiling Flames, and make at him,
to devour him, which scar'd him out of his
Sleep.</P>
<P>When he awoke he, was very much terrify'd
with his Dream, and star'd about him in a frighted
manner, expecting every Minute some Creature
to devour him, but taking a little Courage, put
on his Cloaths, which by this time were quite
dry. He then looks about him; but alass! could
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee nothing but the dreadful Effects of the late
Tempest, dead Corps, broken Planks, and batter'd
Chests floating, and such Aspects which at once
did fill him with Terror and Grief.</P>
<P>Turning from those shocking Objects, which
presented to his Eyes the dreadful Death he so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately had escap'd, he sees at the other side the
Prospect of one more terrible, Hunger and Thirst,
attended with all the Miseries that can make Life
burthensome. Being seiz'd with the Terror of the
threatning Evil, he turns again towards the Sea,
and looking on the dead Corps, whom the Sea
now and then drove to the Rock, and back again.

Oh! that I was like one of you, said he, past all
Dangers; I have shar'd with you in the Terrors
of Death, why did I not also partake with you
of its Relief? but why should I complain? and
have so much Reason to be thankful! Had I been
cut off, when the Cares of saving this worthless
Carcass intercepted me from seeking the Salvation
of my Soul, I should not have had present Op∣portunity
of taking care of it. So having return'd
Thanks for his late Deliverance, resigns himself
to Providence, on whom he fully relies, climbs up
the Rock, and being come to the Top, sees Land at
the Inside, bearing both Trees and Grass: Heavens
be prais'd! said he, I shall not perish upon these
barren Rocks; so made a Shift to get down to it,
the Weather then being calm.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EING come to the other side of
the Rock, he finds at the Portom
of it a narrow Lake which sepa∣rated
it from the Land; therefore
pulling off his Cloaths, the Water
being but shallow, he wades over
with them in his Arms; and, dressing himself,
walks up a considerable way in the Island, without
seeing any human Creature, or perceiving any Sign
of its being inhabited, which struck a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>amp
<PB N="158" REF="173"/>
to his Spirits; he walks it over and over, cross
ways and long ways, yet could see nothing but
Monkeys, strange Beasts, Birds and Fowls, such as
he had never seen before.</P>
<P>Having rang'd himself a weary, he sat down
under a Cluster of Trees that made an agreeable
Arbour; the Place being pleasant and cool, made
as it were for Repose, and he being still very
much fatigu'd, prompted him to lie down and
sleep, during which his Mind is continually alarm'd
with the frightful Aspect of grim Death: Some∣times
he fancies himself striving with the roling
Waves, stretching out his Arms to catch hold of
a Plank tossing by, which just come at, is beaten
back by the roaring Billows, whose terrible Noise
pronounce his Death; then other times he thinks
himself astride upon a Piece of a Mast, labour∣ing
to keep himself on, and of a sudden wash'd
away, and sunk down by a bulky Wave; on eve∣ry
side of him Men calling for Help; others spent,
and are past speaking; here some floating that
are already perish'd, and there others expiring;
thus in every Object seeing his approaching
Fate.</P>
<P>Being awak'd out of that irksome and uneasy
Sleep, he falls into as anxious and melancholy
Thoughts: I have, said he, escap'd being drown'd
but how shall I avoid starving? here's no Food for
Man; but why should I despair? did not <HI>Nebucad∣nezer</HI>
live upon Grass for several Years till re∣stor'd
to his Nation? Cannot I do the same for
a few Days, by which time, Providence, who has
hitherto protected me, may raise me some means to
get from hence: So, being intirely resign'd, he
walks about to see the Island, which he found sur∣rounded
with Rocks, at the Bottom of which there
was a small Lake which was fordable in most
<PB N="159" REF="174"/>
Places, so that he could with Ease wade over to
the Rock, which he did at every side of the Island,
to see if he could perceive any Ship whereby he
might get away: But seeing none, and drawing
towards Night, he returns and employs the Re∣mainder
of the Day in looking for the most con∣venient
Place for him to pass away the approach∣ing
Night; and having fix'd upon a thick Cluster
of Trees, which stood pretty well shelter'd from
the Wind by others that did grow hard by, he
remains there; so having chose the highest Tree,
he gets up as far he well could, fearing some wild
Beast might devour him if he slept below, where
having return'd Thanks to Heaven for his late
great Deliverance, he commits himself to its Care,
then settles, and falls asleep, and slept till Hunger
wak'd him in the Morning, having dreamt over
Night of abundance of Victuals, which he would
fain have come at, but was kept off by a cross
Cook, who bid him go and fish for some; to which
he answered, that he was a Shipwreck, and had
nothing to fish withal; well then, said the Cook to
him again, go where thou wast like to lose thy Life,
and there thou shalt find where withal to sup∣port
it.</P>
<P>Being awak'd, he makes Reflections upon his
Dream, which tho' he imagin'd might proceed from
the Emptiness of his Stomack, being customary
for People to dream of Victuals, when they
go to Bed hungry; yet at that time it might
prove ominous; so driven by Necessity, and led
by Curiosity, he went to the same side of the Rock
he had been cast upon, where having stood several
Hours without seeing Shipping, or aught that did
answer his Dream; the Air coming from the Sea
being preaty Sharp, and he faint, having taken
no manner of Food for near three Days, he gave
<PB N="160" REF="175"/>
over all Hopes of Relief. Thus submitting himself
to the Will of Heaven, whom he suppos'd decreed
a lingering Death to punish him for his past Sins;
resolves to return where he lay the Might before,
and there wait its near hand Coming; but being
stop'd by a sudden Noise which issued from a Creek
in the Rock, not far from where he stood, he had
the Curiosity to go and see what did occasion it.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place he heard the Noise pro∣ceed
from, he sees a fine large Cod-fish, near six
Foot long, dabling in a Hole in the Rock, where
the late Storm had cast it.</P>
<P>One under Condemnation of Death, and just ar∣riv'd
at the Place of Execution, could not be more
rejoic'd at the Coming of a Reprieve, than he
was at the Sight of this Fish, having felt several
sick Qualms, Forerunners of the Death he thought
he was doom'd to. Heavens be prais'd, said he,
here's my Dream right; where Providence rescu'd
my Life from the grim Jaws of Death, there it
has provided me withal to support it.</P>
<P>So having taken off both his Garters, he gets
into the Hole where the Fish lay, and having
run them through its Gills, he hawls it out, and
drags it after him, being heavy, and he very weak▪
Going along, he finds several Oysters, Mussels,
and Cochles in his way, which the Sea had cast
up and down the Rock; having a Knife about
him, he sat down and eat a few, so refresh'd him∣self,
his Spirits being exhausted for Want of Food;
this small Nutriment very much recruted his de∣cay'd
Strength, and the Thoughts of his Supply of
Provision having dispers'd the dull Ideas his late
Want had bred in his Mind, he cheerfully takes
his Fish, which he drags with much more Vigour
than before, and filling his Pockets with Salt
that was congeal'd by the Sun, which he found in
<PB N="161" REF="176"/>
the Concavities of the Rock, away he goes to the
Place where he lay the Night before, in order to
dress some of his Cod-fish; where being come,
he picks up a Parcel of dry Leaves, and with his
Knife and a Flint struck Fire and kindled them,
then getting together a few Sticks, made a Fire
presently, and broils a Slice of his Fish; of which
he eat so heartily, that it overcame his Stomach,
being grown weak with fasting: Thus sick and
out of order, he applies to the helpless Recourse,
which was lying down, and having much fatigu'd
and harrass'd himself with hauling the heavy Fish
up and down the Rock, he fell asleep till the next
Morning, during which time his Rest was very
much disturb'd with the frightful Dream of being
attack'd by a terrible Monster, such as never was
heard of either for Bigness or Grimness, which
pursu'd him, till having run himself out of Breath,
he was forc'd to lie expos'd to his Fury; but was
prevented being devour'd by a grave old Gentle∣woman
of a most graceful and majestick Counte∣nance,
at whose sudden Appearance the Monster
fled: Having recover'd Breath and Strength to
speak, he returns the old Lady Thanks for his De∣liverance,
and begs leave to wait on her home,
that he might know where to come and pay his
constant Duty to her, for this her late great Kind∣ness;
to which she answer'd, that she was fix'd in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particular Habitation, but dwelt at every poor
Man's House, her Occupation being to assist the
helpless, but not the slothful and negligent; that he
should see her again before it was long; the mean
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me she bid him not to go on in evil ways, but
whenever overtaken not to despair; for she was
always at Hand: Nevertheless, she would not have
him too depending, and so went away, leaving him
very easy and pleas'd In his Mind, that he had e∣scap'd
such vast Danger.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="177"/>
Having slept quietly the Remainder of the Night,
he awoke in the Morning pretty fresh and hearty,
but very much disturb'd at his late Dream, which
he fear'd did presage and prognosticate some ap∣proaching
Evil; but as he could make no compa∣rative
Allusion of the old Lady, who rescu'd him
from the Monster; he concludes it must be an In∣spiration
of Providence (whom the grave old Lady
did personate in his Dream) who lately had pre∣serv'd
him from a Death by all Appearance una∣voidable,
to keep him from Despair in this his
great Extremity, promising to be at Hand upon
Occasion; yet would not have him neglect Means
to get away from a Place where Want threatens
him; for tho' he might for a while subsist upon
Fish, wherewith he may be supply'd, being sur∣rounded
by the Sea; yet he could not imagine
which way he could be furnish'd with Cloaths and
Bed against the Winter; for Want of which he
must miserably perish with Cold; unless supply'd
by some such dismal Accident as expos'd him to the
Want thereof, which he heartily wishes and prays
may never happen again.</P>
<P>Having made these Considerations, he, on his
Knees, returns kind Providence his hearty Thanks
for all the Mercies that had been extended upon
him; begging the Continuation of its Assistance;
then, as he took Direction from his Dream, he
watches the Opportunity of getting away from that
melancholy Place, so goes to the other Side of
the Rock, to see if he could perceive any Ship∣ping
in Sight.</P>
<P>The Wind being pretty high, fed his Hopes,
that each succeeding Hour would gratify his wish∣ful
Looks, with that Object the preceding could not
bring forth; but was disappointed, the Night ap∣proaching,
kept back all Probability for that time,
<PB N="163" REF="178"/>
so depending on better Success the next Day, he
returns whence he came, and being hungry, makes
a Fire, and broils another Slice of his Fish, then
lays the rest upon broad, green Leaves, and strows
Salt thereon to keep it from spoiling, so goes to
rest; and as he lay undisturb'd the Night before,
under the Trees, and much more easy than a Top,
he ventur'd again, committing himself to the Cares
of Providence.</P>
<P>But his Thoughts, which all Day had been di∣sturb'd
with the Dread of those Hardships he
must probably undergo, if oblig'd to continue there
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Winter, did so run in his Mind, that it occa∣sioned
Ideas suitable to those he had form'd the
Day before; and Cold being the greatest of his Fears,
it is also the principal Subject of his Dream, which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resented to his Imagination, that he was in a spa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious
Place, pav'd with Hail-stones of a prodigious
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igness, and surrounded with high Mountains of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which echo'd with Shivers; at the further End
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereof he saw an old Man resembling Time, as he
commonly painted, with Heaps of Snow and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail about him, and himself very busy with mak∣ing
more; at his side stood a very beautiful Wo∣man,
whose Shape and Make was uncommon, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r Features and Complexion extraordinary; but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat surpriz'd him most, was her having three
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irs of Breasts, wonderfully handsome, and curi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sly
plac'd, which seem'd to adorn her Bosom far
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore than the richest Stomager made of Diamonds
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pearls could do; so that which in other Wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n
would look monstrous, was in her an Addi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on
to her matchless Beauty.</P>
<P>The Sight of that most perfect and compleat Wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,
warm'd his Blood, which the Coldness of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place had chill'd, and tempted him to come
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rer the Charmer; as he advanc'd, every Step
<PB N="164" REF="179"/>
he made, seem'd to add Strength to his Limbs, and
Vigour to his Life, which made him desirous to
come nearer to the Person from whom he receiv'd
such beneficial Effluvias, but was suddenly stop'd
by the old Man's turning towards him with a grim
aud surly Countenance, which threatned his nearer
Approach with Evil.</P>
<P>Not daring to come nearer, he stands still, won∣dering
what Business that most charming Creature
could have with that surly morose old Fellow;
so lift'ning a while, he perceiv'd she was asking
Boons of him in the Behalf of a vast Number of
all sorts of Creatures that attended her at some Di∣stance
behind, which he refus'd in a most churlish
manner; and as she still persisted in her Suit, fol∣lowing
him up and down, the ill-nrtur'd old Man
slyly steps to the frosty Mourtain, and pulls down
a large Clod of Ice which did stop a Gap therein,
from whence came out a Creature, made and fea∣tur'd
like a Man, but of a monstrous Size, and
frightful Aspect; his excessive broad Cheeks hang∣ing
down on each side of his long picked Chin, like
two empty Bladders; and his preposterous Belly
hung down looking just like a Sail without Wind;
that Monster was no sooner out, but he had Orden
from the spightful old Man to drive away the Wo∣man
and all her Attendance, which Word of Com∣mand
was no sooner given but it was put in Execu∣tion;
having fill'd his shrivel'd Jaws with Wind
which then stood out like so many Kettle Drums
he falls a blowing upon one of the Hills of Snow
and turns it into a thick Shower, which he drow
with Violence against that Angel-like Creature and
her Clients, who immediately fled for Shelter.</P>
<P>This barbarous Treatment to the most deservi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of Creatures, put him in amaze, to whom the an∣gry
old Man (seeing he did not go with the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="165" REF="180"/>
came in a Fury, saying, dost thou put me to De∣fiance?
I'll bury thee in that which I only strow'd
over them, so went to lay hold of him, which did
awake him in a wonderful Fright.</P>
<P>Being awake, he made Reflections upon his late
Dream; all my Dreams, said he, have ever prov'd
ominous, and, if I mistake not, this must have
some Signification; certainly this old Man is Time,
laying up a Store of Frost and Snow against next
Winter, and that goodly Woman is Nature, who,
being tender over all her Creatures, interceeded for
Moderation; and his surly Refusal and rough Usage
prognosticates a forward and hard Winter, to whose
Severity I must lie expos'd, being altogether unpro∣vided.</P>
<P>These Reflections bred various melancholy
Thoughts, which almost led him to Despair: Oh!
said he, that I was but a Mouse, a Bat, or a yet
meaner Creature; then should I be below the cruel
Persecutions of Fate; but Man, who was created
in the noblest Form, endu'd with Reason and Un∣derstanding,
animated with an immortal Soul; must
be aim'd at as the only Mark worthy its malignant
Darts; but why do I thus rave at those Evils we
are the Authors of? had Man continu'd in his ori∣ginal
State of Innocence, the very Name of Fate
or Fortune, would not have been known. Well,
since this is the Product of Sin, I accept this dull
Lot as justly coming to my Share, and humbly sub∣mitting
to Heaven's Decree, I thankfully take this
Dream as a timely Warning, and, in Imitation of
those Creatures represented in it, I'll provide what
Shelter I can against bad Weather comes.</P>
<P>Accordingly first he begins to think of making
himself a House to preserve him from the Injuries
of the Weather, but having nothing to make it of,
nor any Instrument but a Knife, which could be of
<PB N="166" REF="181"/>
little Service to him, so he resolves to go to that
part of Rocks where he was shipwreck'd, to see
if he could discover any thing among the Wreck
that might be serviceable to him, and therefore
takes a Branch of a Tree along with him, and
away he goes to the Place, where he strips himself,
and goes into the Water (the Water being low dis∣covering
the Tops of several sharp-pointed Rocks)
and gropes along with his Staff for sure Footing,
and went up as high as his Chin, diving to the
Bottom frequently, and feeling about with his
Hands; this he continu'd doing for almost two
Hours, but to no purpose, not daring to venture
out of his Depth, for he well knew that he could
do little Good there, because he could discover no
part of the Ship, not so much as the Mast, or
any of the Rigging, so fancy'd she lay in some deep
Hole, where it was impossible to get at her.</P>
<P>Thus despairing, and fretting and teezing him∣self,
he calls to Mind that he had a Hatchet in
his Hand when he was castaway, and thought proba∣bly
it might lie in that Clift of the Rock, into which
he was thrown, so went thither, where looking a∣bout,
he perceiv'd some thing like the Handle of
a Hatchet just above the Surface of the Water at
the Bottom of the Rock, so went down to it, and
took it up, which to his great Joy prov'd to be
the very thing he wanted.</P>
<P>Having got his Tool, he dresses himself, and
goes on to the Island again, intending to cut
down some Trees to make himself a Hut; so look∣ing
about for the properest Plants for his Use,
and taking Notice of a Sort of Trees, whose
Branches, bending to the Ground, did take Root,
and become a Plant, he thought they might be
the fittest for his Purpose, and so cuts a sufficient
<PB N="167" REF="182"/>
Parcel of them to make his Barack, which was full
Business for him that Day.</P>
<P>The next Morning, having paid his usual Devo∣tion,
he walks out again to look a pleasant and con∣venient
Place to make his Hut or Barrack upon;
he walk'd several Hours, and could find none more
shelter'd from the cold Winds than that where he
already lay, being in the middle of the Island, well
fenc'd on the North and East sides with Trees,
which did stand very thick: The Place being fix'd
upon, he hews down some Trees that did grow in
his way, and clears a Spot of Grouud about twelve
Foot square, leaving one Tree standing at each
Corner, and with the young Plants he provided the
Day before, fill'd the Distance between, quite round,
setting them about six Inches asunder, leaving a
larger Vacancy for the Door; his Inclosure being
made, he bends the Branches a Top from both sides,
and weaves them cross one another, and so makes
a Cover to it, which being something to thin, he
lay'd other Branches over, till they were grown
thicker; having finish'd the Top, he goes about
closing the sides; so takes large Branches, which
he strips of their small Twigs, and weaves them
between the Plants as they do for Sheep-pens, then
makes a Door after the same manner.</P>
<P>His Barack being finish'd, which took him up
fifteen Days hard Work; now, said he, here's a
House, but where's the Furniture? this indeed,
may keep the Weather from me, but not the Cold,
the Ground on which I do and must lie is hard,
and doubtless in the Winter will grow damp,
which, with Want of Covering, may occasion Argues
and Feavers, the Cholick and Rheumatism,
and twenty racking Distempers, as may cause me
to repent my having escap'd a milder Death.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="183"/>
In this great Consternation and Perplexity, he
goes to see if he could spy any Shipping riding
within Sight of the Island: As he was walking
along, full of heavy and dull Thoughts, which
weigh'd his Looks to the Ground, he hapned to find
a sort of high Grass that grows but here and there,
round some particular sort of Trees, which he ne∣ver
took notice of before. Heavens be prais'd,
said he, I have found wherewithal to keep my
poor Body from the Ground, whilst I am, by
Providence, doom'd to remain here; so goes on,
intending, at his Return, to cut down a sufficient
Quantity of it to make Mats that might serve him
instead of Bed and Bed-cloaths.</P>
<P>Having look'd himself almost blind, without
seeing the least Prospect of what he desir'd, he
concludes upon going to cut the Grass which he
stood in such Want of, and spread it to dry, whilst
the Weather was yet warm; that Piece of Work
kept him employ'd the Remainder of the Day,
and best part of the succeeding, having nothing
but a Pocket Knife to cut withal: That Work be∣ing
done, wanting a Tool to spread and turn his
Grass, he takes a Branch off the next Tree, which
having strip'd of all the small ones about it, all but
part of that at the Top, being forky, made a toler∣able
Fork; thus being equip'd for Hay-making, he
went on with his Work; and as he was at it, he
saw, at some Distance, several Monkeys, as busy as
himself, scratching something out of the Ground,
which they did eat upon the Spot, and carry'd the
Rest to their Home.</P>
<P>His Hopes, that those Roots might be for his Use,
those Creatures being naturally dainty, eating no∣thing
but what Men may, made him hasten to the
Place he saw them scratching at, that by the Herb
<PB N="169" REF="184"/>
they bear (which they did tear off) he might find
out the Root.</P>
<P>Having, by the Leaves, which he pick'd off the
Ground, found some of the same, he digs 'em up,
aud carry'd them to his Barack, where being come,
he broils a Slice of his Fish, and in the Ashes roasts
them, which eat something like Chesnuts done in
the same Manner.</P>
<P>This new-found-out Eatable much rejoic'd him,
and return'd his hearty Thanks to kind Providence,
that had put him in a way to provide himself
with Bread, and that of the most delicious kind;
so as soon as he had din'd, he went out on pur∣pose
to dig up a good Quantity; but as he was
going to the Place where he had taken Notice
they did grow pretty thick, he sees a Tortois, of a∣bout
a Foot over, crawling before him; Heaven be
prais'd, said he, here's what will supply me both
with Victuals, and Utensils to dress it in; so runs
and turns it on his Back to keep it from get∣ting
away, whilst he went for his Hatchet, that
he might cut the Bottom Shell from the Top, in
order to make a Kettle of the deepest, and a Dish
of the flat part.</P>
<P>Being tir'd of Cod-fish, he dresses the Tortois,
an Animal seldom eaten but upon Extremity, the
Flesh thereof often giving the Flux, nevertheless
she ventur'd upon't, and lik'd it extremely, some
part of it eating very much like Veal, which, at
that time was a very great Novelty to him, hav∣ing
eat no fresh Meat for a long time before.</P>
<P>Happning to eat of that Part of the Tortois
which is the most feeding and less hurtful, he
was in no wise discompos'd; so having boil'd it
all, he laid by the Remainder to cat now and then
between his Fish.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="185"/>
Being provided with a boiling Utensil, he often
had Change, which with the lucky finding out of
those admirable Roots, he eat the roasted ones for
Bread, and sometimes boil'd 'em with Salt-Codd, in
a great Measure mitigated his Misfortune, and sof∣ten'd
the Hardship he lay under; and seeing but
little Prospect of changing his present Condition by
getting away from thence yet a while, he thinks
on Means to make it as easy as possible whilst he re∣main'd
in it; for having projected a Bed, he takes
the Grass, which by that time was dry, so falls
to Work, and a Mat being the thing concluded
upon, he twists his Hay into Roops, the Bigness of
his Leg, then he cuts a pretty Number of Sticks,
about two Foot long, which he drives in the
Ground, ten in a Row, and near four Inches asun∣der,
and oposite to them such an other Row at six
or seven Foot Distance from the first, which made
the length of his Mat; then having fastned one
End of his Rope at one of the corner Sticks, he
brings it round the other corner Stake, and so to
the next at the other End, till he had laid his
Frame; then he weaves across shorter Ropes of the
same, in the Manner as they make Pallions on
Board with old Cable Ends; so when he had fi∣nish'd
his Mat, he beat it with a long Stick which
made it swell up, and the Grass being of a soft
cottony Nature, he had a warm and easy Bed to
lie on.</P>
<P>The Comfort and Pleasure lie found on his soft
Mat (being grown sore with lying on the Ground
for the Space of a Month and more) did so li∣berally
gratifie him for the Time and Labour he
had bestow'd in making of it, that it gave him En∣couragement
to go about another, a Covering being
the next Necessary wanted; for tho' the Weather
was as yet pretty warm, and he in a great Measure
<PB N="171" REF="186"/>
season'd by the Hardship he had gone thorough,
yet the Winter approaching, and the present Season
still favourable for him to make Provision against
it, he goes and cuts more Grass, which being
made ready for use, he lengthens his Loom to al∣low
for rolling up at one End instead of a Boltster,
and makes it thicker than the first, which he in∣tends,
in cold Weather, shall lie upon him instead
of Blankets.</P>
<P>Being provided with the most necessary Furni∣ture
he wanted, he thinks on more Conveniencies,
so resolves to make himself a Table to eat his Vic∣tuals
upon, and a Chear to sit on when at his
Meals; thus having cut several Sticks about four
Foot long, he drives them in a Row a little Way in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ground, then takes smaller, which he inter∣veaves
between, having made the Top, he sets it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon four other Sticks, sorky at the upper End,
which he stuck in the Ground, at one side of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arack to the Height of a Table; this being done
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cuts four more Branches such as he jug'd would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o best for the Seat and Back of a Chair, which he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>so drove in the Ground near his Table, and having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wisted the Branches, that did grow to them, with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch other from Back to Front; and across again
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weaves smaller between, so bottoms his Seat,
which compleats the Furniture of his Habita∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on.</P>
<P>That Care being over, another succeeds of a far
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eater Moment, here's a Dwelling, said he, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elter me from the Weather, and a Bed to rest
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is poor Body of mine, but where is Food to sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort
it? here have I subsisted near one Month up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Fish, which the late dreadful Storm as took
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay forty Lives, sent me to maintain my own:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell, since kind Providence has been pleas'd to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserve my Life preferably to so many, who fa∣tally
<PB N="172" REF="187"/>
perish'd in that dismal Accident, I am bound,
in Gratitude, to hold it pretious; and since my
Fish is almost gone, and not certain of more, I
must by Degrees bring my self to live upon Roots,
which I hope will never be wanting, being the
natural Product of this Island, so I must eat of the
small Remnant of my Fish but now and then to
make it hold out longer; Dainties or Plenty were
not allotted for him that was doom'd to Slavery,
but Labour and hard Living: And if I meet here
the latter, Heavens be prais'd, I have escap'd the
worse; I can take my Rest at my Need, and stand
in no Dread of the severe Inspector and Task-Master.</P>
<P>So being intirely reconcil'd to the State of Life
Providence had been pleas'd to call him to, on
whom fully depending, he resolves to make Pro∣vision
of those excellent Roots; so with his Hat∣chet,
he cuts a Piece of a Tree, wherewith he
makes a Shovel, in Order to dig them up with
more Ease; so with it went to the Place where
he had observ'd they did grow thickest, which being
near the Monkeys Quarters, they came down from
off their Trees in great Numbers, grinning as if
they would have flown at him, which made him
stop a while; he might indeed, with the Instrument
in his Hand, have kill'd several, and perhaps dis∣pers'd
the rest, but would not: Why, said he,
should I add Barbarity to Injustice? it is but na∣tural
and reasonable for every Creature to guard
and defend their own; this was given them by
Nature for Food, which I come to rob them of;
and since I am oblig'd to eat of them for my
Subsistance, if I am decreed to be here another
Season, I will set some in a Place distant from
theirs for my own Use.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="188"/>
Having stood still a considerable Time, those
Animals, seeing he did not go forwards, each went
and scratch'd up for it self, so retir'd, thus gave
him the Opportunity to dig up a few for himself,
and as he was not come to the Place where they
did grow thick, he laid them in small Heaps as he
dug 'em up, which those sly Creatures would,
whilst he was diging up more, come down from
the Trees, where they stood hid amongst the Leaves,
and steal them away, which oblig'd him to be
contented for that time with as many as his Pockets
would hold, resolving to bring something next time
as would contain a larger Quantity; and fearing
those Animals, who are naturally very cunning,
should dig 'em up and hide 'em, he comes early the
Morning following to make his Provision; and for
want of a Sack to put 'em in, he takes his Jacket,
which he buttons up, and ties at the Sleeves; and
as he had observed, that every Root had abundance
of little Offsets hanging at it by small Fibres, he
pull'd off his Shirt also, of which he makes ano∣ther
Sack to put them in.</P>
<P>Being naked, all but his Breeches, and the Day
being pretty hot, he thought he had as good pull
them off too, and fill them, his Jacket being but
short, and therefore holding but few; so having
taken his Bundle in one Arm, and the Shovel in
the other Hand, he gees to the Place he intended
to do the Day before, and expecting to find the
same Opposition as he did then, he brought with
him some of the Roots he had dug up the pre∣ceding
Day, in order to throw them amongst 'em,
and so quiet them; but to his great Wonder, and
as great Satisfaction, those Animals, who the time
before had oppos'd him with Noise and offensive
Motions, let him now pass by quietly, without
<PB N="174" REF="189"/>
offering to meddle with any when dug up, tho'
he laid 'em up by Heaps in their way, and he at
a considerable Distance from them.</P>
<P>This surprizing Reverence from those Creatures,
set him upon deep Reflections on what could be
the Cause thereof; whether it might not proceed
from the Proximity of their Shape and his; but
then said he, my Stature and Colour of Skin is so
different from theirs, that they cannot but distin∣guish
I am not of their kind: No, it must be a
Remnant of that Awe, intail'd by Nature upon all
Animals, to that most noble and compleat Master∣piece
of the Creation call'd <HI>Man,</HI> which now ap∣pearing
in the State he was first created in, and
undisguis'd by Cloaths, renews a Smatch of that
Respect he has forfeited by his fatal Transgression,
which ever since oblig'd him to hide the Beauty of
his Fabrick under a gaudy Disguise, which often
renders him ridiculous to the rest of Mankind, and
generally obnoxious to all other Creatures, making
a Pride of what he ought to be asham'd of: Well,
adds he, since it was my Cloaths as bred the Antipa∣thy,
I will remove that Cause, which will suit both
the Nature of those Animals, and my own Circum∣stances;
so from that time he resolves to go naked,
till the Hardness of the Weather oblig'd him to put
something on.</P>
<P>So having pick'd up a sufficient quantity of Off∣sets,
to stock about two Acres of Land, he returns
Home, leaving behind him a considerable Number
of Roots dug up for those poor Animals, that did
attend him all the Time he was at work, without
offering to touch one till he was gone.</P>
<P>Being come home, he fixes upon a Spot of Ground,
near his Habitation, aud stirs it up as well as he
could with his wooden Instrument, in order to sow
his Seed; which having compass'd in about twenty
<PB N="175" REF="190"/>
Days, he implores a Blessing upon his Labour, and
leaves it to Time to bring forth. Thus having finish∣ed
the most necessary Work about his Barack, he re∣solves
to take a more particular View of the Island,
which till then he had not time to do; so taking a
long Staff in his Hand, he walks to the Lake, which
parts the Land from the Rock, and goes along the
side of it quite round the Island, finding all the
Way new Subjects of Admiration; on the left Hand
did stand a Rampart made of one solid Stone,
adorn'd by Nature with various Forms and Shapes,
beyond the Power of Art to imitate; some parts
chalenging a Likeness to a City, and Clusters of
Houses, with here and there a high Steeple standing
above the other Buildings; another Place claiming
a near Resemblance to a distant Squardon of Men
of War in a Line of Battle; further, it bears Com∣parison
with the dull Remains of some sumptuous
Edisice, ruin'd by the often-repeated Shocks of
Time, inciting the Beholders to Condolence for the
Loss of its former Beauty; at some Distance from
thence the Prospect of a demolish'd City is presented
to the Sigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in another Place large Stones like
small Mountains, laid as it were, a top of one an∣other,
impresses the Mind with an Idea of the
Tower of <HI>Babel:</HI> And on the right Hand a most
pleasant Land cover'd with beautiful green Grass,
like unto Camomile, and here and there a Cluster
of Trees, composing most agreeable Groves, amongst
a vast Number of fine lofty Trees of diverse Height
and Shapes, who stood more distant, whose Irregu∣larity
added much to the Delightfulness of the Place.</P>
<P>As he was walking on, admiring all those won∣derful
Works of Nature, having catch'd cold (not
being us'd to go naked) he happen'd to sneeze oppo∣site
to a Place in the Rock, which hollow'd in after
the manner of the Inside of some Cathedral, and was
<PB N="176" REF="191"/>
answer'd by a Multitude of different Voices issuing
from that Place; the Agreeableness of the Surprize
induc'd him to rouze those Echos a second time;
so he gave a loud Hem, which was, like his Sneezing,
repeated in different Tones, but all very harmoni∣ous;
he hem'd again, and was so delighted with
the Repetition, that he could have spent Hours in
the hearing of it; but why should I, said he, waste
those melodious Sounds, so fit to relate the Al∣mighty's
wonderful Works, and set forth his Praise?
so falls a singing several Psalms and Hymns, with as
much Emulation and Devotion as tho' he had been
in Company with Scores of skillful and celebrated
Choiresters.</P>
<P>Having spent a considerable Time there with
much Pleasure, he proceeds in his Walk, being re∣solv'd
to make that his Place of Worship for the
future, and attend it twice a Day constantly.</P>
<P>About three or four hundred Paces further, having
turn'd on the other side of a jotting-out Part of the
Rock, he was stopt a second Time by another sur∣prizing
Product of Nature; a large Stone growing
out of the Rock, advancing quite over the Lake
at the Bottom it, representing something of a
human Shape; out of the Breast whereof issued a
Fountain of exceeding clear Water, as sweet as Milk;
and when look'd at fronting, was like an antique
Piece of Architecture, which in old Times they
built over particular Springs; and on the other side
appear'd as if springing from the Nostrils of a Sea-Horse:
These three so very different, and yet
rightly compared Likenesses, being offer'd by one
and the same unalter'd Object, made him curious to
examine what Parts of every Resemblance help'd to
make out the others; and having spent a consider∣able
time in the Examination, he found every thing
which the Front had likeness of was imploy'd in
<PB N="177" REF="192"/>
making the Side-representation, by being in some
Places shortn'd, and others lengthen'd, according to
the Point of Sight.</P>
<P>Being satisfy'd about that Subject, he enters upon
another as puzling; the Bason, in which the Foun∣tain
ran, which was about five Yards distant from
whence the Water did spring, being but about nine
Foot over, every way, without any visible Place to
evacuate its Over-compliment, and yet keeping of
the same Height, without dashing or running over,
altho' the Stream that fell into it run as big as his
Wrist; having long time search'd into the Cause,
without any Satisfaction, he conjectures it must
make its way out somewhere under Ground, so
went on till he came to the Place he had begun his
March at, which ended that Day's Work.</P>
<P>Having been round the Island, which, to the best
of his Judgment, was about ten or eleven Miles in
Circumference, of an oblong Form, going in and
but in several Places, extending from North to
South, the South end near as broad again as the
oposite; he resolves to employ the next Day in
viewing the Inside, so recommending himself to
Providence, as he never fail'd to do both Morning
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Evening, he goes to Bed; but not being sleepy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e over-active Faculty in Man, roves from one
Subject to another; his Mind runs from his present
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation to his former, re-assuming his past Pleasures,
which he never must hope to meet with again, and
alls in all the Evils his present Gender of Life lays
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n expos'd to. These dull Thoughts quite dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge
his late-born Hopes of Heavens Assistance, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes his future Dependence on Providence; he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arls and quarrels with his Fate, and repines at his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondition, which not being in his Power to mend,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wishes for Eternal Sleep, to free his Mind of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mults and Cares which croud upon him.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="193"/>
Sleep was granted him, but not Rest, his repining
is chastiz'd with terrifying Dreams of the Punish∣ment
he had been condemn'd to; all his past Trou∣bles
comes upon him, in the most grievious and
shocking Nature they cou'd appear; his raging
Wives at once fall upon him, exerting their outmost
Malice and Revenge, which he cannot avoid; but
by embracing either an ignominous Death, or a se∣vere
and vile Bondage: Those terrible Aspects
put him in the same Pains and Agony, as if already
feeling the assign'd Torment.</P>
<P>Having in his Dream, with hard Strugglings,
escap'd Death, he finds himself in an exceeding hot
Country, his half-naked Body continually bending
to the hard and dry Ground, grabling round a nau∣tious
Weed for fulsome Worms; every now and
then lash'd by cross and severe Task-Master, who
hurries him to Work: In this great Perplexity he
cries out, Oh, that I had ended my woeful Days at
the shameful Gibbet! Sure it would have been a
milder Fate! At which he did awake in such a
Consternation, that it was several Minutes before he
could be throughly satisfy'd it was but a Dream.
Having recall'd his dispers'd Senses, he made this
Reflection, that it really was the the Penalty he
had been sentenc'd to, and by Providence preserved
from; so setting his present Condition in oposition
to that, he acknowledges his Ingratitude, for which
he sorely repents, and on his Knees, with weeping
Eys, asks Pardon, imploring the Continuation of
Providence's Protection, resolving, for the future,
never to think or wish to change that State of Life
it had pleas'd Heavens to place him in, wholly de∣dicating
the Remains of his Days to God's Worship,
holding henceforth as inestimable, the Happiness
of being freed from those Cares which daily flow
on them who are concern'd with the World,
<PB N="179" REF="194"/>
which might cool or slacken his Duty to so great a
Benefactor.</P>
<P>So, having entirely resign'd himself to the Will of
God, he casts off all Cares, and banishes from his
Mind all as could create any; thus resolves to em∣ploy
those Hours, that run between the Intervals of
Time, he had dedicated to Divine Worship, in the
Contemplation of the many wonderful Works of
Nature, manifested in such various manners all over
he Island.</P>
<P>So he walks up the Land, which he found very
level, cover'd with a delightful green Grass, and
adorn'd with Trees of divers Sorts, Shapes, and
Height, inhabited with several sorts of curious sing∣ing
Birds, of various Colours and Notes, which en∣tertain'd
him with their melodious Harmony during
his Walk: In some Places stood a Cluster of Trees,
composing agreeable and delightful Groves, pro∣ceeding
from only one main Body, whose lower
Branches, being come to a certain Length, apply'd to
the Earth for immediate Nourishment, as it were
to ease the old Stem that produc'd them, and so be∣came
a Plant, and did the same.</P>
<P>Having for some time admir'd the Agreeableness
and Curiousity of the Plant, by whom Nature seem'd
to give human kind Instructions; he proceeds
looking about, if perchance he could find any thing
in his way for his own proper Use; so took along
with him a Sample of every different Herb he thought
might be eatable: Crossing the Island in several
Places, he comes at a most delightful Pond, about
two hundred Yards in Length, and one hundred
and fifty wide, with fine Trees spreading their
branchy Limbs over its Brinks, which was sur∣rounded
with a beautiful Bank, cover'd with divers
kinds of Flowers and Herbs, so naturally inter∣mix'd,
which compleated it in Ornament and Con-Conveniency,
<PB N="180" REF="195"/>
as tho' intended by Nature for more
than Mortal's Use.</P>
<P>Having walk'd several times around it, with much
Pleasure, he sat down a while upon its Bank, to ad∣mire
the Clearness of the Water, thro' which, to
his great Comfort he saw many different Sorts of
fine Fish, of various Bignesses, Shapes, and Colours;
Heavens be prais'd, said he, here is a Stock of fresh
Water Fish to supply me with Food, if the Sea
should fail me.</P>
<P>So being sufficiently diverted with their chasing
one another, which being of many beautiful and
different Colours, made a most delightful Scene, he
proceeds in his Walk, and goes to the South end of
the Island, where he finds another Subject of Ad∣miration;
a noble and spacious Wood, whose
Shades seem'd to be made for the abode of Peace
and Pleasure; he walk'd round it with much De∣light,
which made the Time seem short, yet he
could guess it to be no less than two Miles about.</P>
<P>Having view'd the out Side, whose extraordinary
Agreeableness incited the Beholders to inquire into,
which, doubtless it inclos'd; he had an unsur∣mountable
Desire to go into it, but was afraid to
venture, least there might be destructive Cretures
as might harm him; yet having recommended him∣self
to the Cares of Providence, he ventur'd into it,
finding several pleasant Walks, some straight, edg'd
with losty Trees as tho' planted for Pleasure, others
crooked and winding, border'd with a thick Hedge
of Piamento's, which did cast a most fragrant
Smell, here and there a large Cluster of Busines
and dwarf Trees, wherein shelter'd several different
kinds of wild Beasts and Fowls; sure, said he, this
Island never was intended by Nature to lie waste,
but rather reserv'd to be the happy Abode of some,
for whom Heavens had a particular Blessing in store;
<PB N="181" REF="196"/>
Here is every thing sufficient, not only for the Sup∣port,
but also for the Pleasure of Life; Heavens
make me thankful, that I am the happy Inhabitant
of so blessed a Land.</P>
<P>Being hungry and tir'd with walking, he goes
Home, in order to get some Victuals; so having
made a Fire he boils a Slice of his Salt-Fish with
some Roots, and then the Herbs he brought with
him, which prov'd of diverse Taste and all excel∣lent;
some eating like Artichoaks, others like As∣paragus
and Spinage; now, said he, what can I
wish for more? Here I possess a plentiful Land,
which produces both Fowls, Flesh, and Fish, bears
excellent Greens and Roots, and affords the best of
Water, which by Nature was ordain'd for Man's
Drink; Pomp and Greatness are but Pagentry,
which oftentimes proves more prejudicial to the
Actor, than diverting to the Beholder; Ease and
Indulgence are apt to breed the Gout and various
Distempers, which make the Rich more wretched
than the Poor: Now, these Evils, Thanks to my
Maker, I stand in no Danger of, having but what is
sufficient, which never can do any Harm.</P>
<P>Thus throughly easy in his Mind, he proposes to
spend the Afternoon at the Out-side of the Rock,
in viewing the Sea, and looking for Oysters; so
takes in his Hand his long Staff to grabble in Holes,
and his Breeches, which he ties at the Knees to
bring them in: Being come to a Place of the Rock
he never had been at before, he sees, at a Distance,
something like Linen hanging upon't, which when
come at, he found to be the Main-Sail of a Ship,
with a Piece of the Yard fasten'd to it; alass, said
he, a dismal Token of unsatiable Ambition! which
makes Men often lose their Lives, in seeking what
they seldom find, and if ever they do, 'tis common∣ly
attended with a World of Cares: Happy is he
<PB N="182" REF="197"/>
who limits his Desires to his Ability, aspiring not
above his Reach, and is contented with what Na∣ture
requires: So falls a ripping the Sheet from the
Yard, which he finds in one Place ty'd with one of
his Garters (having himself made use of it for want
of another String) Heavens be prais'd, said he, this
is no Effect of another Shipwreck, but a Fragment
of the unfortunate Ship, whose Loss was my Re∣demption,
with that falls a Weeping.</P>
<P>Having ripp'd the Sail in Pieces, he rolls them up
in such Bundles as he could conveniently carry, and
lays them down till he had got a few Oysters, so
proceeded groping in Holes with his Stick as he
went on.</P>
<P>About forty Paces further, he finds a Chest in a
Clift of the Rock, which had been wash'd up there
by the Voilence of the late Storm: Heavens, said
he, more fatal Effects of Fate's Cruelty and Man's
Temerity! Was the Sea made for Men to travel
on? Is there not Land enough for his rambling
Mind to rove? Must he hunt after Dangers and put
Death to Defiance? What is the Owner of this the
better for it now? Or, who can be the better in a
Place so remote, and the Access to it so difficult,
being not to be approach'd, but on the Wings of
Providence, and over the Back of Death? Now,
was this full of massy Gold, or yet richer Things,
I thank my God, I am above the Use of it; yet
I'll take it Home, it was sent here by Providence;
perhaps for the Relief of some so necessiated and
destitute; so goes to lift it, but could not, there∣fore
was oblig'd to fetch his Hatchet to beat it open,
that he might take away what was in it by de∣grees;
so having taken as much of the Sail-Cloath
as he could conveniently carry, with the few Oy∣sters
he had got, he went Home and fetch'd the
Tool, wherewith he wrench'd the Chest open, from
<PB N="183" REF="198"/>
which he took a Suit of Cloaths and some wearing
Linen, these, said he, neither the Owner, nor I,
do want, so laid them down, the next Thing he
took out, was a Roll of several Sheets of Parchment,
being blank Indentures and Leases; these, said he,
are Instruments of the Law, and often apply'd to
Injustice; but I'll alter their mischievious Properties,
and make them Records of Heavens Mercies, and
Providence's wonderful Liberality to me; so instead
of being the Ruin of some, they may chance to be the
reclaiming of others: At the Bottom of the Chest
lay a Rundlet of Brandy, a <HI>Cheshire</HI> Cheese, a Lea∣ther
Bottle full of Ink, with a Parcel of Pens, and a
Pen-Knife; as for these, said he, they are of Use,
the Pens, Ink, and Parchment have acquip'd me to
keep a Journal, which will divert and and pass away
a few anctious Hours; as for the Cheese and Brandy,
they will but cause me new Cares, before I had 'em,
I wanted 'em not; now, the Benefit and Comfort
I shall find in them (when gone) will make me hanker
after them most; I wish had still been without 'em,
but now they are here, it would be a Sin to let
them be lost, I'll take them Home, and only use
them at my need, which will both make them hold
out the longer, and me grow less fond of them.</P>
<P>So by by Degrees takes Home the Chest, and
what was in it; and now having Materials to begin
his Journal, he immediately fell to Work, that, for
want of other Books, he might, at his Leisure, per∣use
his past Transactions, and the many Mercies he
had receiv'd from Heaven; and, that after his De∣cease,
whoever is directed there by Providence,
upon reading his wonderful Escapes in the greatest
of Dangers, his miraculous Living, when remote
from human Assistance, that in the like Extremity
they might not despair: Thus begins, from his being
eight Years old (as well as he can remember he
<PB N="184" REF="199"/>
heard an old Aunt of his say) to the Day of his
being Cart-away, which happen'd on the 10th of
<HI>July,</HI> 1675, being then twenty eight Years of Age,
resolving to continue it to his Death.</P>
<P>Thus having written the preceeding Account of
his Shipwreck, and what had befaln him since, to
the finding of the Chest, which was on the 15th of
<HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptember,</HI> 1675 he proceeds; but calling to Mind
his last Dream but one, which did warn him to
make Provision against Winter, and the Season be∣ing
pretty far advanc'd, he gathers a good Store of
Fuel and Roots, begins to line the Out-side of his
Barack with a Wall of Turf, and lays the same at
Top, to keep out the Wet; and as he now and then
did find small Shell-fish and Oysters upon the Rock,
he makes a Bridge over the Lake, which in warm
Weather he did use to wade, that in the Winter he
might go over dry; so having compleated his Bridge,
which was made of two strong Poles, that did reach
from the Land to the Rock, and several lesser
Branches laid a cross, pretty close, he retires Home,
the Day being far spent: The following Night,
being the 18th of <HI>September,</HI> there arose a violent
Storm, attended with dreadful Claps of Thunder,
which the many Echos from the Rock render'd
more terrible, and Lightnings flashing in a most
frightful Manner, succeeding each other, before the
preceeding was well out of the Sky, which put
poor lonesome <HI>Quarll</HI> in such a Consternation, that
(notwithstanding his Reliance on Heaven's Pro∣tection)
he would have given the World (had it
been in his Possession) to have been within the
Reach of human Assistance; or, at least to have
some Company, Solitude adding much to his Terror
and Affliction.</P>
<P>The glorious Rising of the next Mornings Sun,
having laid the mortifing Rage of the blustring
<PB N="185" REF="200"/>
Winds, <HI>Quarll,</HI> whose late Alarm was hardly quell'd
still suspected its most reviving Rays, to be
terrifying Glances and Flashings of Lightnings;
but having lain a while, and hearing no Noise,
but that, which still did rage in his Mind, was at
last convinc'd the Storm was over, and so gets up,
with a Resolution to go and see if he could descern
any Effects of the late Tempest.</P>
<P>Being come at the other Side of the Rock, he saw
indeed, surprizing Objects, but not afflicting; the
Mischief that was done, being to the Inhabitants of
the Sea only, a vast Number of which, had, by the
obstropulous Wind been dis-elemented; a Quantity
of stately Whitings, fine Mackerels, large Herrings,
diverse sizes of Codlings, and several other sorts of
Fish, with a great Number of Shells, of different
Shapes and Bignesses, lying up and down upon the
Rock. Heavens be prais'd! said he, instead of Dam∣age
to bewail, what Thanks have I now to return for
this mighty Benefit? Here the powerful Agent of
Mischief is, by kind Providence, made a Minister of
Good to me; make me thankful, I am now pro∣vided
for all the next Winter, and yet longer, by
which time I'm certain to have fresh Supply.</P>
<Q><L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Least the Reader should think, these and the following Verses to be the Effect of my own Brain, I solemnly protest they are what I found in his Memoirs, written with his own Hand.</NOTE> He whom, when in Distress,</L>
<L>To GOD makes his Address;</L>
<L>And his Bounties implore,</L>
<L>Is sure; and may depend</L>
<L>That Relief he will send,</L>
<L>And at need help the Poor.</L></Q>
<P>Thus having taken up as many Fish, as he could
hold in his Arms, carries 'em Home, and brings
<PB N="186" REF="201"/>
his Shirt, which he us'd instead of a Sack; so at
several times he brought away all the Fish, and as
many of the Shells as he had occasion for, some of
which he made Boilers and Stewpans, of others
Dishes and Plates, some he kept Water in, and
others Fish in Pickle; so that he was stock'd with
necessary Vessels, as well as Provisions.</P>
<P>Being very weary with often going backwards and
forwards for his Fishes, which took up all that
Day to bring 'em Home, he set down to rest him∣self
and the Rundlet of Brandy lying by, he was
tempted to take a Sup, which was at that time
very much wanted, his Spirits being, very low; but
was loath to taste it, least he should grow fond of
the Liquor, and grieve after it when gone: Some
Moments were spent before he could come to a
Resolution; at last, having consider'd the Use of
it, which suited the present Occasion; he concludes
to take a Dram, and so use it like a Cordial, as it
was at first intended for; but the Vessel, out of
which he did drink, being at his Mouth, the Cor∣dial
turns to a Nector; one Gulp decoys another
down; so the intended Dram becomes a hearty
Draught. The Pleasantness of the Liquor made
him forget its Nature, so that poor <HI>Quarll,</HI> who
had, for the Space of near three Months before,
drank nothing but Water, was presently overcome
with the Strength of the Brandy, and fell asleep
in his Chair, with the Rundlet on his bare Lap,
from whence it soon fill to the Ground, and being
unstop'd, did run all out.</P>
<P>Being awak'd with Hunger, having slept from an
Evening till almost Noon of another Day, which
he knew not whether the succeeding, or the next
to it: seeing what had happen'd was sorely vex'd,
and could have wept at the Accident, but consi∣dering
the Liquor which had occasion'd it, might
<PB N="187" REF="202"/>
perhaps in time, have caus'd greater Mischief; he
soon was reconcil'd with that Loss, but could not
with that of the right Order of die Days, which
having intirely forgot, hinder'd the going on of his
Journal, so was oblig'd to make only a Memorial:
That Damage being repair'd, an other appears of
a far greater Consequence, the <HI>Sunday</HI> is loft which
he had so carefully observ'd to that time, how can
that be made up? Now said he, shall I daily be in
Danger of breaking the Sabbath, knowing not the
Day! Oh fatal Liquor! that ever thou wert in∣vented
to cause so much Mischief; Murders, Adul∣teries,
and Blasphemies, are daily, by thy most per∣nicious
Use, occasion'd; but why should I lay the
Blame upon the Use, when it's the Abuse as does
the Hurt, and exclaim against a Thing, which being
taken in Moderation, is of so great a Benefit, re∣viving
a fainting Heart, raising sinking Spirits,
warming cold and decay'd Nature, and asswaging
several Pains; so blames himself highly for gratify∣ing
his Appetite, with that wherewith he only
ought to have refresh'd Nature; and since that of∣ten
misguided Faculty had promped him to com∣mit
the Fault, he did dedicate that Day, in which
he became sensible of it; in Prayers and Fasting,
and every Seventh from that, he sets apart for Di∣vine
Worship only, which he hop'd would keep
him from breaking the Commandments, for keeping
Holy the Sabbath Day; it being not certain that
the Day appointed by the Church for that Purpose,
was the very Day God had sanctify'd for Rest, so
went to the Place, where the Ecchos, in many diffe∣rent
and melodious Sounds, did repeat his Thanks∣giving
to the Almighty, which he had sixt upon to
pay his Devotions, and there spent the Rest of the
Day in Prayers and singing of Psalms.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="203"/>
The next Morning, having breakfasted with some
of his usual Bread, and a Slice of the Cheese he
found in the Chest, he goes about curing of his
Fish in order to salt 'em, having lay'd by as many
for the present Use, as he thought he could eat
whilst fresh; he improves the fair Weather to dry
one Part of the Remainder, and keeps the Rest in
Pickle.</P>
<P>The Winter being near at Hand, and the Wea∣ther
growing damp and cold, hinders him from his
Walks, so being confin'd within Doors, he imploys
his idle Hours in beautifying his Utensils, which
were not to be us'd upon the Fire, and bestow'd some
Pains in scraping and polishing the Rest of his
Shells, some, as fine as tho' they had been Nakers
of Pearl, which made them not only more fit for
their intended Uses, but also a great Ornament to
his Barack, which he shelv'd round with platted
Twigs after the Manner of his Table, and so set
them upon't.</P>
<P>Thus he spent the best Part of the Winter,
making no further Remarks, but that it was very
sharp, attended with high Winds, abundance of
Hail and Snow, which oblig'd him to make a
Broom to sweep it away from about his Hut,
which otherwise would have been damag'd by it.</P>
<P>But shivering Winter, having exausted his frosty
Stores, and weary with vexing Nature, retir'd; Bo∣reas
also, grown faint with hard blowing, is forc'd
to retreat into his Cave; gentle Zephirus (who till
then kept up in his temperate Cell) now comes
forth to usher in the blooming Spring; so mildly
slips on to inform Nature of her Favourite's Ap∣proach,
who at the joyful News puts on her
gay enamel'd Garb, and, out of her rich Wardrobe
supplies all Vegetables with new Vesture, to wel∣come
the most lovely Guest. The feather'd Choi∣risters
<PB N="189" REF="204"/>
also receive new Strength, their tender Lungs
are repair'd from the Injuries the foggy and' misty
Air did occasion; and thus reviv'd, are plac'd on
every budding Tree, to grace his Entrance with
their harmonious Notes.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> also, whom bad Weather had confin'd
within Doors a considerable Time, which had in
a great Measure numb'd his Limbs, and dull'd his
Senses, now finds himself quite reviv'd, he no
longer can keep within, the fair Weather invites
him out, the singing Birds on every Side call to
him, Nature it self fetches him out to behold her
Treasures.</P>
<P>Having with unspeakable Pleasure walk'd some
time, diverted with the sweet Melody of various
kinds of singing Birds, and the Sight of abundance
of different sorts of blossom'd Trees and blooming
Flowers; all Things within the lsland, inspiring
joy; he had the Curiosity to go and view the Sea,
so goes over his Bridge, and then at the over Side
of the Rock, where he finds more Objects, requiring
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s much Admiration, but affording a great deal less
Pleasure: Vasl Mountains of Ice floating up and
flown in Numbers, threatning Emersion to all as
came in their Way.</P>
<P>These terrible Effects of the Winter, which to
that Time was a Stranger to, occasion'd his making
these Reflections:
<Q><L>He, who on Billows roves, Riches or Wealth to gain,</L>
<L>Is ever in Danger, and labours oft in vain;</L>
<L>If Fortune on him smiles, giving his Toil Success,</L>
<L>Each Day new Cares arise, which mar his Happiness;</L>
<L>The only Treasure then, worth laying up in Store,</L>
<L>Is a contented Mind, which never leaves one Poor,</L>
<L>He is not truly Rich, who hankers after more.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="205"/>
So having return'd Heaven Thanks for his happy
State, being above wishing to enjoy Content; he
creeps to the North-east Side of the Rock, at the
Foot of which lay, an extraordinary large Whale,
which the late high Wind had cast there, and dy'd
for want of Water. If this, said he, is all the Da∣mage
that has been done last Winter, it may be
born, so went down and measur'd the Length of
it, whith was above 30 Yards, and proportionably
in Bigness; there were Shoals of small Fishes
swimming about it in the shallow Water wherein
it lay, as rejoicing at its Death; thus said he, the
oppress'd rejoice at a Tyrant's Fall; what Number
of these have been destroy'd to make this mon∣strous
bulk of Fat; well, happy are they, who, like
me, are under Heaven's Government only; so with
his Knife, which he always carried in his Pocket,
cuts several Slices of the Whale, and throws them
to the small Fishes, saying, 'tis but just ye should
at last feed on that which so long fed on you; and
as Oil run in abundance from the Places he had
cut the Slices out of, it vex'd him to see that wasted,
as might turn to good Money, but why said he,
shou'd I be disturb'd at it, what Use have I for
any? Providence takes none, it gives me all <HI>gratis;</HI>
so goes on feeling for Oysters with his Staff, which
he always walk'd with, being a great Help to him,
in climbing up the Rock.</P>
<P>Having at last found a Hole, where by their rat∣tling
at the Bottom with his Staff, he judg'd there
might be a pretty many, he marks the Place, and
goes Home to contrive some Instrument to drag
them up, being yet too cold for him to go in the
Water; and as he had no Tool but his Knife and
Hatchet, both improper to make a Hole in a Board,
as requisite to make a Rake which was wanting for
that Purpose; he beats out the End of his Chest,
<PB N="191" REF="206"/>
in which there was a Knot; so having driven it out,
he fatstens the small End of a Pole in it: Thus
equip'd, he went and rak'd up Oysters, which ad∣ded
one Dish to his Ordinary, and Sauce to others;
yet at length his Stomach growing qualmish with
eating altogether Fish, and drinking nothing but
Water withal, he wishes he could have a little
Flesh, which he might easily, there being Animals
enough in the Wood apparently fit for Food, but
then he must deprive them of their Lives, barely
to make his own more easy.</P>
<P>Thus debates with himself for some time, whe∣ther
or no, it would not be Injustice for him (who
only by a providential Accident was brought there
to save his Life) now to destroy those Creatures,
whom (to preserve) Nature has given Being, in
a Land out of Man's reach to disturb; yet Nature
requires what seems to be against Nature for me to
grant: I am faint, and like to grow worse, the
longer I abstain from Flesh.</P>
<P>Having paus'd a while, why said he, should I
be so scrupulous! were not all Things created for the
Use of Man? Now, whether it is not worse to let
a Man perish, than to destroy any other Creature
for his Relief? Nature craves it, and Providence
gives it; now, not to use it in Necessity, is under∣valuing
the Gift, and despising the Donor.</P>
<P>So having concluded upon catching some of those
Animals he had seen in the Wood, he considers by
which means, having no Dogs to hunt, not Guns
to shoot; having paus'd a while, he resolves upon
making Gins, wherewith he had seen Hares catch'd
in <HI>Europe;</HI> thus taking some of the Cords which
she found with the Sail at the out-side of the Rock;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he goes to work, and makes several, which he fa∣stens
at divers Gaps in the Thick-set within the
<PB N="192" REF="207"/>
Wood, thorough which he judg'd that sort of
Beast (he had a Mind for) went.</P>
<P>Impatient to know the Success of his Snares, he
gets up by time the next Morning, and goes to ex∣amine
them, in one of which he found a certain
Animal something like a Fawn, the Colour of a
Deer, but Feet and Ears like a Fox, and as big as
a well grown Hare; he was much rejoyc'd at his
Game, whose Mouth he immediately open'd to
see if he could find out whether he fed upon
Grass, or liv'd upon Pray. The Creature being
catch'd by the Neck, and strangled with strugling
before it dy'd, had brought up in his Throat
some of the Greens it had been eating, which very
much pleas'd him, accounting those who liv'd upon
Flesh as bad as Carrion.</P>
<P>Having return'd Thanks for his good Luck, he
takes it Home in order to dress part of it for his
Dinner, so cases and guts it; but its proving to be
a Female, big with three young ones, griev'd him
to the Heart, and made him repent making those
killing Noozes; what pity said he, so many Lives
should be lost, and Creatures wasted, one would
have serv'd me four Days, and here are four kill'd
at once, three were of being, not come to Perfection,
must be thrown away; well, henceforth to prevent
the like Evil, I'll take alive what I just want, and save
all the Females; so having stuck a long Stick at
both Ends in the Ground, making a half Circle,
he hangs one Quarter of the Animal on a String
before a good Fire, and so roasts it.</P>
<P>His Dinner being ready, having said Grace, he
set to eating with an uncommon Appetite, and
whether it was the Novelty of the Dish, or that
the Meat did really deserve the Praise, he really
thought he never eat any Thing of Flesh before
comparable to't, either for Taste or Tenderness.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="208"/>
Having din'd both plentifully and deliciously,
he most zealously returns kind Providence Thanks
for the late, and all Favours receiv'd, then pursuant
to his Resolution; he goes about making Nets, in
order to take his Game alive for the future, and as
he had no small Twine to make it withal, he was
oblig'd to unravel some of the Sail which he luckily
had by him, and with the Thread, twist some of
the Bigness he judg'd proper for that Use.</P>
<P>Having made a sufficient Quantity, he makes a
couple of Nets about four Foot square, which he
fastens in the Room of the killing Snares; so re∣tir'd,
having implor'd Heaven's Blessing on his
Labour, and resolv'd to come and examine them
every Morning.</P>
<P>Several Days pass'd without taking any Thing,
so that he wanted Flesh a whole Week, which did
begin to disorder his Stomach, but not his Temper;
being intirely resigned to the Will of Providence,
and fully contented with whatever Heaven was
pleas'd to send.</P>
<P>One Afternoon, which was not his customary
Time of Day to examine his Nets, being they are
too visible in the Day for Game to run in; he hap∣pen'd
to walk in the Wood to take a full Dimention
thereof, so chanced to go by his Nets, in one of
which was taken two Animals, as big as a Kid six
Weeks old, of a bright Dun, their Horns upright
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd straight, their Shape like a Stag, most curiously
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imb'd, a small Tuff of Hair on each Shoulder and
Hip; by their Horns which were but short, they
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppear'd to be very young, which rejoyc'd him the
more, being in hopes to tame, those which he did
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot want for present Use; so carry'd them Home,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>yful of his Game, depending upon a good Din∣ner,
but was sadly disappointed, the Animals he
found they were Antilopes (calling to Mind he had
<PB N="194" REF="209"/>
seen of them in his Travels) and proving both Fe∣males,
which he had made a Resolution to preserve,
tho' they were too young to be with Kid, and he in
great need of Flesh, yet he would not kill them, so
with Cords fastens them to the outside of his Lodge,
and with constant feeding of them in two Months
time, made them so tame, that they follow'd him
up and down, which added much to the Pleasure
he already took in his Habitation, which by that
time was cover'd with green Leaves, both Top and
Sides; the Stakes it was made off, having struck
Root, and shot out young Branches, whose Strength
promising that Summer to fill up the Vacancy be∣tween
each Plant, made him pull down the Turss
wherewith he had cover'd the outside and top of
his Hut, to keep the Cold out in the Winter.</P>
<P>His former Hut being now become a pleasant Ar∣bour,
gave him Encouragement to bestow some
Pains about it, towards the Imbelishment of it,
which seemingly depends on being well attended;
he resolves upon keeping of it prun'd and water'd,
the better to make it grow thick and fast, which
answer'd his Intent, for in three Years time, the
Stems of every Plant as compos'd the Arbour,
were grown quite close, and made a solid Wall of
about six Inches thick, cover'd with green Leafs
without, which lay most regular and even, and
within, with a most agreeable smooth Bark of a
pleasant Olive-colour.</P>
<P>His late Arbour being, by his Care and Time
and Nature's Assistance, become a matchless Lodge,
as intended by Nature for something more than hu∣mane
Guest, he now consults to make it as com∣modious
as beautiful; here is, said he, a delightful
Dwelling, warm in the Winter, and cool in the
Summer, delightful to the Eye, and comfortabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the Body; pity it shou'd be imploy'd to any
<PB N="195" REF="210"/>
Use, but Repose and Delight: So resolves upon
making a Kitchen near it, as being the principal
and most prejudicial Office to a House; thus having
fixd upon a Place convenient at the next Side of his
Lodge, about six Foot from it, twelve in Length,
and eight in Breadth, which he incloses with the
Turfs as covered the outside of his Arbour, before
it was sufficiently thick to keep out the Cold; then
having lay'd Sticks a-cross the Top of the Walls,
which were about eight Foot high, he lays Turfs
thereon, and so covers it, leaving an open Place for
the Smoak to go out off.</P>
<P>The outside being done, he goes about inside Ne∣cessaries,
as Fire-places to roast and boil at; thus
cuts a Hole in the Ground at a small Distance from
the Wall, after the Manner of stew Stoves in No∣blemen's
and great Eating-house Kitchens; then
at another convenient Place, he sets two flat Stones,
about eight or nine Inches broad, and one Foot
long edge-ways, opposite one another, near two
Foot asunder, then puts a third in the same Man∣ner
at the End of the other two, so makes a Fire∣place
fit to roast at: Then for other Conveniencies,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he weaves Twigs about Sticks, stuck in the Wall
one side of his Kitchen, where he lays the Shells
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us'd for Utensils, which both adorn'd and fur∣nish'd it.</P>
<P>Having compleated that Piece of Work, he goes
and visits his Plantations, which he finds in a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hriving Condition, the Roots being, in six Months
time, grown from the bigness of a Pea (as they
were when first set) to that of an Egg; his Anti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>opes
also were come to their full Growth, and
compleat Beauty, which exceeded most four
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooted Beasts; having a magestick Presence the
Body and Limbs were like a Stag, and the
noble March of a Horse: So every Thing did con∣cur
<PB N="196" REF="211"/>
to his Happiness; for which, having return'd
his most liberal Benefactor his most grateful Ac∣knowledgments,
he thinks on Means to prevent
any Obstructious, as may intercept the Continua∣tion
thereof; and as the Want of Cloaths was the
only Cause he could think of, as might make him
uneasy; having but the Jacket and Hose which
were given him on Board, to save his own Cloths,
which when, worn out, he could not recruit;
therefore, to accustom himself to go without, he
thins those he had, so takes away the Lining from
the outside of his Clothing, in order to wear the
thickest in the coldest Weather; and so thin
his Dress by degrees, till at last, he went quite
naked.</P>
<P>Having thus concluded, as being the best Shift
Necessity could raise him, he falls a ripping his
Jacket, in the Lining whereof he finds seven
Peas and three Beans, which were got in at a
Hole, at the Corner of the Pocket.</P>
<P>Those few made him wish for more, which
he had no room to hope for, being they are
rais'd by Seed, which the Island did not pro∣duce:
These few, said he, which at present,
are hardly sufficient so satisfy a Woman's Long∣ing,
may, with Time and lndustry, be improv'd
to a Quantity, large enough to serve me for a
Meal; then lays them up against a proper Time to
set 'em, so spent the Remainder of that Summer in
walking about the Island, watering his Lodge, weed∣ing
his Root Plantation, attending his Nets, which
now and then supply'd him with an Antelope or
Goat to eat at Intervals between Fish, he com∣monly
found on the Rock after high Winds and
Storms, never failing to visit the Sea, three or
four times a Week, according as the Weather
did prove, thus diverted many anxious Hour
<PB N="197" REF="212"/>
with Variety of Objects that Element affords:
Sometimes, he had the Pleasure of seeing great
Whales chasing one another, spouting large Streams
of Water out of their Gills and Nostrils; and O∣ther
times numbers of beautiful Dolphins rolling
amongst the Waves; now and then a Quantity or
strange monstrous Fish, playing on the Surface of
the Sea, some whereof had Heads like Hogs, others
like Dogs, Calves, Horses, Lions, Bulls, Goats,
and several other Likenesses, not common to Fishes,
some chasing another Sort, who, to avoid being
taken, would quit its Element, and seeek Refuge in
the Air, and fly some Yards above Water, till
their Fins being dry, obliged them to plunge in a∣gain.</P>
<P>These Pastimes, being generally succeeded with
bad Weather and dreadful Storms, check'd the Plea∣sure
they gave, with a Dread of the Evil that
threatn'd to follow, thus commiserating the Case of
those, whose Misfortune it is to be expos'd to them.</P>
<P>Having spent several Hours in that ominous
Pastime, he goes to his usual Devotion, making the
Pond in his Way, which he had been at twice, or
thrice a Week, ever since his being in the Island,
and calling to Mind, that in all that time he never
saw a young Fish in it, he conjectur'd something
must destroy the small Ones, and as he imagin'd it
prov'd to be; for, at his Approach, then flew out
of the Pond, a large Fowl, with a Fish in his Bill,
being too large for it to swallow.</P>
<P>The Distance he was at, as also the Bird being
upon the Wing, he could not discern, neither Co∣lour
nor Make; but he had the Satisfaction of dis∣covering
the Cause why the Fish did not encrease,
being devour'd when young by that Creature,
which, to prevent for the future, he studies on
means to kill the Destroyer; Nets not being pro∣per
<PB N="198" REF="213"/>
Instruments, it being requisite for that Purpose
to have one all round, as also to cover the Pond,
which was impossible, by Reason of its Largness,
and a Less being of no use, the Bird probably not
coming to a certain Place; he wish'd for a Gun,
and Amunition fitting, as being the most probable
Thing to succeed; but no such Instrument being
in his reach, he ponders again, during which time,
a Cross-Bow offers itself to his Mind, but is as distant
from his reach as the Gun; 'tis true, there was
Stuff enough in the Island to make many, but no
Tools, but a Hatchet and a Pocket-Knife, where∣with
if he made shift to cut and shape a Bow, he
could not make a Latch and Spring necessary to it,
so he must not think on't; yet, a Bow being the
only Thing he could apply to, he goes about one
forthwith, thus having pick'd a Branch of a Tree,
which had the Resemblance of Yew and as tough,
of which they are sometimes made; he with the
Tools he had made shift to make one, of about six
Foot long, and Arrows of the same, which he
hardens and straightens over the Fire, then having
slit them at one End about two or three Inches, he
slips in a Bit of Parchment, cut sharp at one End,
and about three Inches at the other, then ties the
End close to keep it in, which serv'd for Feathers,
and with the Ravelings of some of the Sail he makes
a String to it.</P>
<P>Thus equipt for an Archer, wanting nothing but
Skill, which is only to be gain'd by Practice, he
daily exercise Shooting at a Mark for the Space
of a Fortnight; in which time he made such an
Improvment, that in three Shoots he would hit a
Mark of about three Inches square, at near fifty
Paces distance.</P>
<P>Being sufficiently skill'd, he goes and lays in
wait for iris desir'd Game; so placed him self behind
<PB N="199" REF="214"/>
a Tree, as near to the Pond as he could, where the
Bird came in few Hours after.</P>
<P>The Creature being pitch'd upon the Bank, never
stood still, but kept running round, watching for a
sizeable Fish fit to swallow, so that he had no Op∣pertunity
to shoot; till having at last spy'd out one,
it launch'd itself into the Poud, but rais'd more easily,
which gave him time to take Aim, nevertheless he
miss'd it, being in Motion; but when come to the
Top he took it thro' the Body, as it open'd its
Wings, and laid flat on the other Side of the
Pond: He took it up, wonderfully pleas'd at his
good Success the first Time of his practicing his
newly-acquir'd Art; yet, having taken Notice
of the Birds Beauty, he had a Regret for its Death,
tho' he might in time have rue'd its living; the
Stock of Fish Weekly decreasing by his own catch∣ing
one now and then with a Small-Net, he made
for that Use, when short of other Provisions, and
their recruiting prevented by that Bird's daily de∣vouring
their Young. 'Tis true, said he, I have by
killing this admirable Creature, preserv'd what is
much better for my Use; but then, I have destroy'd
that as was certainly made for Nature's Diversion,
such Variety of Colours, so regularly plac'd, and
wonderfully order'd, that at the least Motion of ei∣ther
the Object or Beholder, they seem'd to inter∣change
each-others Seat.</P>
<P>Besides, the inexpressible Beauty of the Feathers,
which were after the Nature of a Drake, every one
distingush'd from one another, by a Rim round the
Edge thereof, about the Breadth of a large Thread,
and of a changeable Colour, from Red to Aurora
and Green; the Ribs of a delightful Blue, and the
Feathers-Pearl colour, speckl'd with a bright Yellow,
the Breast and Belly (if it might be said to be of any
particular Colour) was that of a Dove's Feathers,
<PB N="200" REF="215"/>
rim'd like the Back, diversly changing; the Head,
which wae like that of a Swan for make, was Pur∣ple
also, changing according as mov'd; the Bill like
burnish'd Gold; Eyes like a Ruby, with a Rim of
Gold round it; the Feet the same as the Bill; the
Bigness of the Bird, was between a middling Goose
and a Duck, and the Make of a Swan.</P>
<P>Having bemoan'd the Death of that delightful
Creature, he carefully takes out its Flesh, which
corrupting would spoil the Outside, then fills the
Skin with sweet Herbs, which he dry'd for that
Use, then having sow'd up the Place he had cut
open to take the Flesh out, he set it up in his
Lodge.</P>
<P>His good Success in Archering, made him love
the Exercise; so, that what odd Hours he had in
the Day, besides those he set a Part for his Divine
Worship, and those necessary Occupations about his
Lodge, Plantations, and making Remarks, he be∣stow'd
in shooting at the Mark, which in Time,
made him so expert, that he hardly would miss a
standing Mark the Bigness of a Dove, at forty or
fifty Yards distance, once in ten Times, and toller∣ably
would shoot as well Flying: Having once the
Opportunity and Occasion to try it upon a mon∣strous
Eagle, who often flew rounding, over the
Place where his <HI>Antelopes</HI> and <HI>Goats</HI> fed, near his
Lodge, whom he Shot at, fearing it would damage
them and kill'd with the second Arrow.</P>
<P>The Summer being over, during which, having
been much took up about his Habitation and Plan∣tations,
he had neither Time nor Opportunity to
make Remarks, no further than that it was some
Days very Show'ry, and for the generality very
hot; but now the Weather being grown something
cold, and the Wind pretty Sharp, he must be o∣blig'd
to put on same Cloaths to keep it off, being,
<PB N="201" REF="216"/>
as yet, too tender to go any longer without, next
to provide for his <HI>Antelopes,</HI> against the Near-at-hand
Winter; so makes a Lodge for them at the
Backside of his Kitchin, with Sticks, which he
drove into the Ground about two Foot from the
Wall, and then bends them about three Foot from
the Ground, and sticks them about the said Wall, and
smaller Branches he inter-wove between them, he
shuts up the Front, and covers the Top, leaving
both Ends open for the Animals to go in at, then
lays Grass (which he got dry'd on Purpose) in the
said Lodge for them to lie on; thus having dug up
a considerable Quantity of Roots, and being already
stock'd with Salt-fish both dry and in Pickle, he
was pretty well provided for his Cattle, and himself
against the ensuing Winter, which prov'd much like
the preceeding one, only not so stormy.</P>
<P>The succeeding Spring having awak'd slumbring
Nature, and reviv'd what the preceeding hard Sea∣son
had caus'd to droop, every Vegetable puts on
new Cloathings, and recovers their wonted Beauty;
each Animal assumes fresh Vigour, the Beasts in
the Wood leap and bounce for Joy; and each Bird
on the Trees sings for Gladness, the whole Creation,
is, as it were, repair'd, and every Creature deck'd
with new Life; Love, by Nature's Direction for the
Increase of every Kind, warms their harmless Breasts,
each Animal seeks a Mate, our tame <HI>Antelope</HI>'s quit
their Abode, and range the Woods for the Relief
ordain'd to quell their innocent Passion, which being
asswag'd, they return Home, pregnant with Young,
to their Master's great Satisfaction, who having
given them over, was doubly rejoyc'd to see them
come again in an increasing Condition; Heaven's
be prais'd, said he, I shall have a Stock of my own,
and will not fear wanting.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="217"/>
So having made fitting Preparations against their
Kidding he goes and examines, the Improvement of
his new Plantation, where he found his Roots grown
full as large as any of those that grew wild; make
me thankful, said he, I am now provided with all
necessary Food, I shall no more need to rob those
poor Creatures, of that, which Nature had provided
for their own proper Use; next he goes and views
his small Stock of Peas and Beans, which he found
in a very promising Case; so, whilst the Weather
was fair, he falls a Clearing a Spot of Ground to
to set them in, as they did encrease.</P>
<P>Turning up the Ground he found several sorts of
Roots, that look'd to be eatable, some whereof was
as Big as a large Carrot, others left, he broke a Bit
of every one, some breaking Short and not Stringy,
he judg'd they might be eatable; then he smells
them, and finding the Scent not disagreeable he
tastes them, some was sweetish, others sharp and
hot like Horse-Raddish, and those he proposes to
use instead of Spice, sure, said he, these being of a
pleasant Scent and Savour, cannot be of an offensive
Nature; so having manur'd his Ground, he takes
a Sample of every Root which he judg'd eatable,
and boils them, as the surest Way to Experiment
their Goodness.</P>
<P>They most of them prov'd not only passable good,
but extraordinary; some eating like Parsnips, O∣thers
almost like a Carrot, but rather more agreeable,
some like Beets and Turnips, every one in their se∣veral
Kind, as good as ever he eat in <HI>England,</HI> but
different Colours and Make; some being Bluish, o∣thers
Blank, some Red, and some Yellow; these,
tho' not wanted, having already sufficient to gratify
a nicer Taste than his, were nevertheless extream∣ly
welcome, being something like his Native Coun∣try
Fare and Product: so having return'd Thanks
<PB N="203" REF="218"/>
for this most agreeable Addition to his Ordinary;
he sets a Mark to every Herb which those Roots
did bear, in order to get some of the Seed to sow in
a Ground he would prepare; so being provided
with Flesh, Fish, Herbs and several sorts of Roots,
he goes and examins what Improvment his Pease
and Beans had made, which he found increas'd to
Admiration, the seven Pease having produc'd one
thousand, and the three Beans one hundred; hav∣ing
return'd Thanks for that vast Increase, he lies
them by, in Order to set them at a proper Season,
as he had done the Year before.</P>
<P>By this time his <HI>Antelopes</HI> had Kidded, one of
them having brought four young Ones, and the
second three; this vast Adition to his Provisions
very much rejoyc'd him, being sure now not to
want Flesh at his need, which before he was in
danger of, finding but seldom any thing in his Net;
so makes Account to live upon two of the young
Bucks whilst they lasted, killing one as soon as sit
for Meat, and so now and then another, saving
only five to breed, one whereof should be a Mate
to keep the Females in Rutting-time from the
Wood, least, at one time or other they should stay
away for good and all.</P>
<P>The old Ones being well sed, as he always took
Care to do, providing for them store of those
Greens he knew they lov'd, as also boil'd Roots for
them now and then, Of which they are very fond;
the young Ones throve a Pace, and did grow very
fat, so, that in three Weeks time they were large
and fit to eat: He kill'd one, which being roasted,
did prove more delicious than any House-Lamb,
Sucking-Pig, young Faun, or any other Sucklings
whatever.</P>
<P>Having liv'd upon that, with now and then a little
Fish, about one Month, which was as long as he
<PB N="204" REF="219"/>
could keep it eatable, having dress'd it at two differ∣ent
times, five Days interval, eating the cold Re∣mains
in several Manners, reserving one of the other
two Males for a Time he should be scanted and
want of Flesh, but was unluckily dsappointed by a
Parcel of large Eagles, who flying one Morning o∣ver
the Place where the young <HI>Antelopes</HI> playing,
being of a say, as well as active Disposition, who
lanc'd themselves with Precipitation upon the Male,
he reserv'd for Time of Need, and one of the Fe∣males,
which he kept for breed, seeing his beloved
Diverters carrying away by those Birds of Prey,
he runs in for his Bow; but came too late with it
the Eagles being gone.</P>
<P>The Loss of his two dear <HI>Antelopes,</HI> especially
the Female, having doom'd the Male for his own
eating, hardly could forbear weeping, to think of
their being cruelly torn to Pieces by those ravenous
Creatures: Thus, having for some Time lamented
his Loss, and bewail'd their hard Fate, he thinks on
Means to prevent the like Evil, for the Time to
come; and as his Bow was not always at Hand, he
resolves upon making a Net, and fasten it between
the Trees he law them come in at.</P>
<P>The succeeding Winter proving very Wet and
Windy, gave him but little Invitation to take his
usual Walks; so having every Thing he had occa∣sion
for at Hand, he kept close to his Net-making;
for which, having Twine to twist, and Thread to
ravel out, to make the said Twine, kept him im∣ploy'd
till the following Spring, which came on a
pace.</P>
<P>Having finish'd his Net, and every Thing as did
belong to't, he goes and fastens it to the Trees, as
he had propos'd; then takes a Walk to his new
Plantations, which he found in a thriving Conditi∣on;
for which, and other Benefits already receiv'd,
<PB N="205" REF="220"/>
he resolves, as in Duty bound, to attend at his
usual Place of Worship, and sing Thanksgiving
Psalms, which the Hardness of the Weather had
kept him from all the late Winter; but coming into
his Mind, that whilst he was at his Deuotion, re∣turning
Thanks for the fair Prospect of a plentiful
Crop, his <HI>Antelope</HI>'s would break into the Close, the
Hedge being as yet, but thin, and devour the pro∣mising
Buds, which are the principle Occasion of
his Devotion: This not altogether unproper Consi∣deration,
puts a sad Check to his Religious Intenti∣on;
and tho', there was a vast Obligation, to prompt
him to the Performance of that Part of his Duty,
yet he could not, with Wisdom, run the Hazard, out
of meer Devotion, to lose so promising a Crop,
which he should never be able to retrieve, all his
Stock of Seed being then in Grass.</P>
<P>As he was debating in his Mind, between Reli∣gion
and Reason, whether the Latter ought not to
be a Director to the First, he perceiv'd his <HI>Ante∣lopes</HI>
making towards the Pease, where, they doubt∣less
would have got in, had he not return'd, and
drove them another way, which Accident did con∣vince
him he might find a more proper Time to go
about his Devotion, no Man being required to wor∣ship
to his Prejudice; so, having put off his religi∣ous
Duty, till he had better secur'd his Pease and
Beans, he cuts a parcel of Branches, wherewith he
stops those Gaps, to prevent the Creatures going
in; so having compleated his Work, he goes to his
Devotion, adding to his usual Thanksgiving, a par∣ticular
Collect for his lucky being in the Way, to
prevent his being frustrated of the Blessing Heaven
so fairly promis'd to bestow on his Labours.</P>
<P>Having paid his Devotion, he walks about the
Island, being all the Way delighted with the Birds
celebrating their Maker's Praise, in their different
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
harmonious Notes, every Thing in Nature, said
he, answers the End of their Creation, but ungrate∣ful
man! Who, ambitious to be wise as his Creator,
only learns to make himself wretched; so walks
till the Evening, making several Reflections on the
different Conditions of Men, esteeming his present
State to that of <HI>Adam</HI> before his Fall, who could
not be sensible of Happiness, having never known a
Reverse, otherwise he would have been more care∣ful
to prevent; so being come Home, and near Bed∣time,
he first eats his Supper, and them having per∣form'd
his customary religious Service, he goes to
Bed, and the next Morning, after paying his usual
Devotion, he takes a Walk to his Plantations, on
which he implores a Continuation of the prosperous
Condition they appear to be in; next he goes to ex∣amine
his new Nets, in which he finds a Brace of
Fowls like Ducks, but as large again, and exceeding
beautiful, the Drake (which he knew by a colour'd
Feather on his Rump) was of a fine Cinamon Co∣lour
upon his Back, his Breast of a Mazarine Blue,
the Belly of a deep Orange, his Neck Green, Head
Purple, his Eyes, Bill and Feet Red, every Colour
changing most agreeable as they mov'd; the Duck
was also very beautiful, but of quite different Co∣lours,
much paler than the Drake's.</P>
<P>The Disapointment in catching those delightful
Fowls instead of ravenous Eagles, as he did purpose,
no ways displeas'd him, but rather was rejoyc'd to
have such beautiful Fowls to look at; yet, it went
much against his Mind, to deprive those Creatures
of their Liberty (the greatest Comforts in Life)
whom Nature took such Pains to adorn; but, said
he, they were created for the Use of Man; so, in
keeping them for my Pleasure, they will but answer
the End of their Creation, their Confinement shall
be no stricter than my own, they shall have the
<PB N="206" REF="222"/>
whole Island to range in; so he pinions them, and
puts them in the Pond; then makes Baskets for
them to shelter in, which he places in the Branches
of those Trees that hung closest to the Water, ta∣king
particular Care to feed them daily with Roots
roasted and boil'd; and the Guts of the Fishes, and
other Creatures, he us'd for his own eating, which
made them thrive mainly, and take to the Place; so
that they bred in their Season.</P>
<P>The five Antelopes had, by this Time, kindled
and brought sixteen young ones: His Pease and
Beans also were wonderfully improv'd, having that
Season enough to stock the Ground the Year fol∣lowing.
Thus he return'd kind Providence Thanks
for that vast Encrease, and concludes to live upon
the young Antelopes as long as they lasted, reserv∣ing
only one, for Suck of the old ones, to keep them
in Milk, of which he had taken Notice they were
very flush, designing to draw it daily for his own
Use; so that, in a little Time he had enough to
skim for Cream, which he did use for Saufe in∣stead
of Butter, and made small Cheeses with the
rest: Now having a pretty Store;of Dary-Ware, he
resolves to make a Place to keep it in; the Kitchen
wherein he was oblig'd to lay his Salt-Fish (which
commonly smells strong) not being a proper Place
for Cream and milk, so makes a Dairy-House at the
other Side of his Dwelling, with Branches of Trees,
after the Manner of a closs Arbour, and thatches it
over with Grass; which answering the Kitchen in
Form and Situation, made uniform Wings, that
added as much to the Beauty as Conveniency of
the Habitation.</P>
<P>So having compleated his Dairy, he proceeds in
his Resolution of making Cheese, having learn'd the
Way in <HI>Holland;</HI> and for Want of Runnet to turn
his Milk, he takes some of the Horse-Rardice Seed,
<PB N="208" REF="223"/>
which, being of a hot Nature, had the same Effect;
so having Curd to his Mind, he seasons it to his Pa∣late;
then with his Hatchet, he cuts a Notch round
in the Bark of a Tree, about eighteen Inches in Cir∣cumference,
and a second in the same Manner six In∣ches
below that; then slits the Circle, and with
his Knife gently opens it, so parts it from the Tree;
thus he makes as many Hoops as he judg'd would
contain his Paste, which being girded round with
Cords to keep them from opening, he fills with the
said, and lays them by, till sit to eat; observing
the same Method he had taken Notice they did
whom he saw make them.</P>
<P>This being done which compleated his Provisions,
he returns Thanks for those Blessings which
he had been so liberally bestow'd on him; now, said
he, Heavens be prais'd, I exceed a Prince in Happi∣ness;
I have a Habitation strong and lasting, beau∣tiful
and convenient free Hold, a Store of Com∣forts,
with all Necessaries of Life, free-cost, which
I enjoy with Peace undisturbable, and Pleasure un∣controll'd;
yet, I think there is still something wan∣ting
to complete my Happiness, if a Partner in
Grief lessens Sorrow, certainly it must in Delight
augment the Pleasures. What Objects of Admira∣tion
are here conceal'd, and like a Miser's Treasure,
hid from the World! if Man, who was created for
Bliss, could have been compleatly happy alone, he
would not have had a Companion given him; so
walks about thoughtful till Bed-Time; Sleep, says
he, which unsits Men for Company, is the fittest
State for me who can get none, so that I could un∣der
its dark Shades pass away the Remainder of
my lonesome Life, those anxious Hours, which
vex my Soul, would inoffensively slip away.</P>
<P>In that dull Disposition he goes to Bed, and as
Vexation commouly stupisies the Senses, he soon fell
<PB N="209" REF="224"/>
asleep: The Night also being windy added to his
heavy Disposition; but his disturbed Mind finds no
Repose, it still runs on upon the Subject, that took
it up the Day before, and forms Ideas suitable to
its Inclination; and as Solitude was the Motive of
its being disturbed, he indulges it with the Thoughts
of Company, so dreams that the Fame of his Stati∣on,
and happy State of Life was spread about the
World, that it did prompt a vast Number of Peo∣ple
from all Parts to come to it, which at last did
enduce several Princes to claim a Right to it, which
being decided by a bloody War, a Governor was
sent, who laid Taxes, demanded Duties, rais'd
Rents, and warns him to be gone (having fix'd upon
his Habitation for himself to dwell in, being sadly
disturbed with that Dream) he cries out in his
Sleep, This is a great Punishment for my Uneasi∣ness;
could I not be contented with being Lord of
this Island, without provoking Heavens to bring
me under the Power of extorting Governors.</P>
<P>There happening a great Noise, he starts out of
his Sleep, with the Thought of hearing a Proclama∣tion,
cry'd out, Alas! said he, 'tis too late to pro∣claim
an Evil which is already come; but being
throughly awake, and the Noise still continuing, he
found he had been dreaming, which very much re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oic'd
him; so puts on his Cloaths, and hastens to
the Pleace he heard the Noise come from.</P>
<P>Being within forty or fifty Yards thereof, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw a Number of Monkeys of two different Kinds,
the one Sort squeeling and fighting against the o∣ther,
without intermixing, but still rallying as they
scatter'd in the Scuffle. He stood sometime admir∣ing
the Order they kept in, and the Battle still conti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing
as fierce as at first, he advanc'd to see what
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey fought about; for he took Notice they very
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch strove to keep their Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="225"/>
At his approach the Battle ceas'd, and the Com∣batants
retiring at some Distance, left the Spot of
Ground, on which they fought, clear, whereon lay
a considerable Quantity of wild Pomgranates, the
Wind had shook off the Trees the Night before,
which were the Occasion of their Strife.</P>
<P>His coming having caus'd a Truce, every one of
those Creatures keeping still and quiet during his
stay, he resolves to use his Endeavours to make a
through Peace; and as that Difference did arise
from the Fruit there present, to which he could see
no Reason, but that each Kind had an equal Right,
he devides it in tow even Parcels, which he lays
opposite to each other towards both the Parties; so
retir'd a little Way, to see whether his Expedient
should decide the Quarrel, which answer'd his In∣tent,
those Animals quietly coming to that Share
next to them, and peaceably carries it away, each
to their Quarters; this occasion'd several Reflecti∣ons
on the frivolous, and often unjust Quarrels that
arise among Princes, which create such bloody
Wars, as prove the Destruction of vast Numbers of
their Subjects; if Monarchs, said he, did always
act with as much Reason as these Creatures, how
much Blood and Money would they save? Thus
goes on to his usual Place of Worship, in order to
return Thanks, that he was free of that Evil, the
Dream, whereof he had so tortur'd his Mind, tho'
he confes'd he justly deserv'd the Reality, for his
Uneasiness in the happiest of Circumstances.</P>
<P>Having pay'd his Devotion, he takes a Walk to see
how his Pease and Beans came on, which he found
in a very improving Disposition, each Stem bearing
a vast Number of well-fill'd Codds; Heaven's be
prais'd! said he, I shall eat of this Year's Crop
and have sufficient to stock my Ground the ensuing
one.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="226"/>
Thus being plentifully supply'd for Necessaries and
in a pleasant Island, every Thing about him being come
to Persection, and still promising Improvement; his
Dwelling, which seems intended by Nature for some
immortal Guest, being by Time, yearly repair'd and
improv'd, leaving no room for Care; yet the unwise
Man, as tho' Enemy to his own Ease, cannot be
concented with the Enjoyment, of more than he
could reasonably crave, but must desturb his Mind
with what concerns him not: What pity, said he, so
delightful a Habitation, attended with such Conve∣niencies,
and situated in so wholesome an Air and
fruitful a Land, should at my Death lose all these
wonderful Properties, being become useless for want
of some Body to enjoy them, what Admiration will
here be lost for want of Beholders? But what kind
of Man could I settle it upon, worthy of so fine an
Inheritance? Was it at my Pleasure to chuse myself
an Heir, such as appears virtuous, whose weak Na∣ture
confides to Chastity; every Constitution can∣not
bear Excess, want of Courage occasions Mild∣ness,
and lack of Strength good Temper; this Vir∣tue
is made a Cloke to Infirmity; but, why do I
thus willingly hamper myself with those Cares Pro∣vidence
has been pleas'd to free me of?</P>
<Q><L>Leave the Miser'd the knowing Care,</L>

<L>Thus racks his Soul with Discontent,</L>

Sun till the going down thereof; therefore, shall the
Day before, make all necessary Provision for that Day.</P>
<P>THAT, he shall after any tempestuous Wind or
Storm, visit the Sea at the Out-side of the Rock, at
the East, South, West and North sides, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ends,
in order to assist any one in Distress.</P>
<P>HE shall not be wasteful of any thing whatsoever,
especially of any Creatures Life, killing no more,
than what is necessary for his Health, but shall e∣very
Day examine his Nets, setting at Liberty the
Over-plus of his Necessity, least they should perish
in their Confinement.</P>
<P>HE must also keep every Thing in the same Order
and Cleanness he shall find them in; till and ma∣nure
the Ground yearly, set and sow Plants and
Seeds fit for Food in their proper Seasons.</P>
<P>Having written this at the Bottom of the Map
he had drawn, being Supper-time he takes his Meal,
then goes to his usual Evening-devotion, and after
an Hours walk to his Bed, so slept quietly all Night,
being easy in his Mind.</P>
<P>The next Morning he takes his usual Walks, and
visits his Nets; in that he had set for Eagles, he
found a Fowl as big as a Turkey, but the Colour
of a Pheasant, only a Tail like a Partridge; this
having no Sign of being a Bird of Prey, was loath
to kill it; but having had no fresh Meat for above a
<PB N="214" REF="229"/>
Week, he yields to his Appetite and dresses it, so
eats part thereof for his Dinner, it was very fat and
plump, and did eat much like a Pheasant, but ra∣ther
tenderer and fuller of Gravey.</P>
<P>Tho' he was very well pleas'd with the Bird he
had taken, yet he had rather it had been one of the
Eagles, which held his young Antelopes in Jeopardy,
but as he could not destroy them with his Net,
which had hung a considerable Time without the
intended Success, he proiects the Prevention of their
Encrease, by destroying their Eggs, so leaves his
Nets wholy for the Use they had been successful in,
and searches the Clifts of the Rock next to the Sea,
where those Birds commonly build, and having
found several Nests, he takes away the Eggs that
were in them (being then their breeding-time) so
carries them Home, in order to empty the Shells,
and hang them up and down in his Habitation, a∣mongst
the green Leaves which cover'd the Ceiling
thereof; but having accidently broke one, and the
Yolk and White thereof being like that of a Turkey,
he had the Curiosity to boil one and taste it, which
eat much after the manner of a Swans, the rest he
sav'd to eat now and then for a Change, so reaps a
double Advantage by robbing those Birds, lessening
thereby the Damage they might do him in Time
and adding a Dish to his present Fare.</P>
<P>In this prosperous way he liv'd fifteen Years, find∣ing
no Alteration in the Weather or Seasons, nor
happening all the Time any Transactions worthy of
Record, still performing his usual Exercises, and
taking his usual Walks with all the Content and Sa∣tisfaction
his happy Condition could procure, in∣tirely
forsaking all Thoughts or Desires of ever
quitting the blessed Station he then had in his Pos∣session.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="230"/>
Thus having walk'd the Island over and over,
which, tho' delightful, yet the often Repetition of
the Wonders it produces, renders them, as it were,
common and less admirable, so he proceeds to view
the Sea, whose fluid Element being ever in Motion
daily afords new Objects of wonder.</P>
<P>The Day being very fair, and the Weather as
calm, he sat himself down upon the Rock, taking
pleasure in seeing the Waves roll, and as it were to
chace one another, the next pursuing the first, on
which it rides when come at, and being itself over∣taken
by a succeeding, is also mounted on, thus,
Wave upon Wave till come to a bulky Body, too
heavy for the Undermost to bear, sunk altogether;
this, said he, is a true Emblem of Ambition, Men
striving to out do one another, are often undone.</P>
<P>As he was making Reflections on the emptyness
of Vanity, and the insolidity of Pride, returning
Heavens thanks that he was from the World, which
abounds in nothing else. A Ship appears at a great
Distance, a Sight he had not seen since his Ship∣wreck;
unlucky Invention, said he, that thou should
ever come into Mens thoughts! The <HI>Ark,</HI> which
gave the first Notion of floating Habitation, was
order'd for the Preservation of Man, but its fatal
Coppies daily expose him to Destruction; so hav∣return'd
Heaven's thanks for his being out of those
Dangers, he makes a solemn Vow, never to run in
them again, tho' it was to gain the World; but his
Resolution prov'd as brittle as his Nature was frail:
The Men on Board, had 'spy'd him out with their
Perspective-Glasses, and supposing him to be a Ship∣wreck
that wanted Relief, sent their Long-Boat with
two Men to fetch him away.</P>
<P>At their approach his Heart alters its Motion,
his Blood stops from its common Course, his Si∣news
are are all stagnated, which entirely unframes
<PB N="216" REF="231"/>
his Reason, and makes him a Stranger to his own
Inclination, which strugling with his wavering Re∣solution,
occasions a Debate between Hope and Fear;
but the Boat being come pretty nigh gave Hope
the Advantage, and made his late Resolution yield
to his reviv'd Inclination, which being now encou∣raged
by a probable Opportunity of being answer'd
rushes on to Execution, quitting all his former Re∣liance
on Providence, depends altogether upon his
getting away, blessing the lucky Opportunity of
seeing his Native Country again, for which Plea∣sure
he freely quits and forsakes all the Happiness he
did enjoy, gladly abandoning his delightful Habita∣tion
and plentiful Island, so thinks no more of Pro∣vidence,
his Mind is entirely took up with his Voy∣age;
but, Disapointment which often attends the
greatest Probabilities, snatches Success out of his
Hand before he could grasp it, so intercepts his
thought-infallible Retreat, the Boat could not ap∣proach
him, by reason of the Rocks running a great
way into the Sea under Water, nor could come at the
Boat for sharp Points and deep Holes, which made
it unfordable as well as unnavigable; so that after
several Hours striving in vain on both sides, to come
at one another; the Men, after they had strove all
the could but to no purpose, said something to him
in a Rage, which he understood not, went without
him, more wretched than he was when he was first
cast away; his full Dependance upon a Retreat made
him to abandon all further Reliance on Providence,
whom then he could implore; but now having un∣gratefully
despis'd Heaven's Bounties, which had
been so largly bestow'd on him, he has forfeited all
hopes of Assistance from thence, and expects not
from the World: Thus destitute, and in the great∣est
Perplexity, he cries out, where shall I now fly
for help? the World can give me none, and I dare
<PB N="217" REF="232"/>
not crave any more from Heaven. Oh cursed De∣lusion!
but rather cursed Weakness! Why did I
give way to it? Had I not enough of the World,
or was I grown weary of being happy? With that,
he falls a Weeping; could I shed a Flood of Tears,
sufficient to wash away my Fault, or ease me of the
Remorse it does create; but why does my destracted
Fancy propose Impossibilities? Is not the Ocean
sufficient to rid me of this wretched Life? Then
adieu infectious World, thou Magician of Iniquity!
the Thoughts of which are now more offensive
than the most nautious Odour of an old Sepulchre;
so was going to cast himself into the Sea; but a
vast large Monster, raising out of the Water, with
its terrible Jaws wide open, looking at him in a
most dreadful manner, stop'd the Execution of his
desperate Design: Thus, Death appearing in a dif∣ferent
Shape than he had propos'd to meet him in,
frightens away his resolution of dying: I may,
said he, condemn my self, but Vengeance belongs to
God alone, who rejects not Tears of Repentance;
but always extends his Mercies towards the Peni∣tent;
and since St. <HI>Peter,</HI> after thrice denying his
LORD and MASTER, was by repenting and weeping
over his Sin, received again into favour; so I
hope these my weak but sincere Tokens of Repen∣tance
will be accepted off, for ever divorcing myself
from the World, and never think of its alluring
Pleasures, but to despise them: And for the better
performance of that pious Resolution, he sets that
woeful Day apart (in which he did commit that
fatal Deed) for Prayer and Fasting: Thus he went
Home, and having eat nothing since the Day be∣fore,
he spent the Remainder of that in fasting and
praying, singing penitential Psalms till dark Night,
that Nature urg'd him to repose.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="233"/>
The Pains and Labour he had been at in the Days
climbing up and down the Rock, draging himself
to and through, to come at the Boat, having very
much rack'd his Limbs, and the Disappointment of
his full Dependance on the said promsing success;
as also the tormenting Remorse, and heavy Grief
for his sinful Reliance thereon, did much fatigue his
Mind, render'd Sleep, which is ordain'd for the
Refreshment of Nature, of no Manner of Help to
him; his Thoughts are continually disturb'd with
frightful Visions, all his past Dangers glare at him,
as if threatning their Return; but that which terri∣fied
him most was the frightful Idea of the terrible
Monster, which did rise out of the Sea at that In∣stant
he was going to plunge himself in it.</P>
<P>Being awak'd out of his restless Sleep, rather
more fatigu'd than when he lay down, having still
the terrible Aspect of the Sea Monster in his Mind,
he made several Reflections on the execrable Na∣ture
of his intended Sin, admiring the immense
Goodness of Providence, who, to deter him from the
committing of the enormous Act, did order that
(past-Imagination) terrible Object, as the most suit∣able
to the Barbarity of his Design, to strike in him
that Terror which the Gender of Death he had
fix'd upon could could not. Thus having with
Tears acknowledg'd the Enormity of his Resoluti∣on,
he returns Providence Thanks for its inesti∣mable
Goodness, who (notwithstanding his late
most ungrateful Elopement) did preserve him from
eternal, as well as temporal Ruin; so haing paid his
Devotion, and sung a thanksgiving Psalm, he takes a
little Nourishment, his Spirits being low with his
past Fatigue and Fasting; and as he could not put
out of his Eyes the terrible Aspect of the Monster,
which being beyond any Chimerical Conception, he
resolves to draw it according to the Idea he had in
<PB N="219" REF="234"/>
his Mind, perhaps, said he, having often the Re∣presentation
before mine Eyes, 'twill make the Ob∣ject
more familiar, thus less frightful; so takes Pen
and Ink and a Sheet of Parchment, now, said he,
how shall I represent what is past Imagination to
conceive; a Form without Likeness, and yet com∣parable
to the most terrible Part of every frightful
Creature; a vast large Head, resembling that of a
Lyon, bearing three Pairs of Horns, one Pair up∣right,
like that of an <HI>Antelope,</HI> another Pair like
a wild Goats, two more bending backwards; it's
Face arm'd all round with Darts, like a Porcupine;
vast great Eyes, sparkling as a Flint struck with a
Steel; it's Nose like a wild Horse, always snarling;
the Mouth of a Lyon, and Teeth of a Panther; the
Fences of an Elephant, and the Tusks of a wild
Boar; shoulder'd like a Giant, with Claws like an
Eagle, body'd and cover'd with Shells like a Rino∣cero<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
and the Colour of a Crocodile.</P>
<P>Having similed every different Part, he proceeds
in the Representation thereof; which being finish'd,
put him in the greatest of Admirations: Sure, said
he, if Nature had a Hand in thy making it was to
assume in one Creature, all that the fiercest and
dreadfulest Animals, that are most frightful and ter∣rible;
now perhaps, this being constantly before me,
may come less in my Mind; so fixes it against his
Wall, this, said he, will be also a Memorandum of
my late VOW, never to endeavour, or wish to go
from hence, what ever Opportunity offers, tho' at∣tended
with never so great a Probability of Success
and Prospect of Gain; fully settling his whole Mind
and Affection on the State and Condition Heavens
has been pleas'd to place him in, resolving to let
nothing enter into his Thoughts, but his most
grateful Duty to so great a Benefactor, who
<PB N="220" REF="235"/>
has so often and miraculously riscu'd him from
Death.</P>
<P>Thus having entirely banish'd the World out of
his Mind, which before often disturb'd it, he limits
his Thoughts within the Bounds of his blessed Pos∣session,
which affords him more than is sufficient to
make his Life happy, where Plenty flows on him,
and Pleasure attends his Desires, abounding in all
Things that can gratifie his Appetite, or delight
his Fancy: A Herd of delightful <HI>Antelopes</HI> bouncing
and playing about his Habitation divert him at
Home, and in his Walks he is enteretain'd with the
Harmony of diverse Kinds of singing Birds; every
Place he comes at offers him new Objects for Plea∣sure:
Thus all seems to concur in compleating his
Happiness.</P>
<P>In this most blessed State he thinks himself as
<HI>Adam</HI> before his Fall, having no Room for Wish∣es,
only that every Thing may continue in its pre∣sent
Condition; but it connot be expected that fair
Weather, which smiles on his Beauty, will change.
The Sun must go its Course, and the Seasons take
their Turn, Which Considerations must for the
present admit some small Care, he is naked, and his
tender Constitution susceptible to the Cold; there∣fore
the Cloaths he was cast away in being worn
out, he is oblig'd to think of providing something
to defend his Limbs from the Hardness of the ap∣proaching
Winter, whilst it is yet warm; so having
consider'd what to make a Wrapper of, he concludes
upon using some of the same Grass he made his Mats
of, on which he lay, being soft and warm, very fit
for that Purpose; so he goes and cuts down a suffi∣cient
Quantity, which, when ready to work, he
makes small Twine with, and plats it in narrow
Breeds, which he sues together with some of the
<PB N="221" REF="236"/>
same, and so shapes a long loose Gown that cover'd
him to his Heels, and a Cap of the same.</P>
<P>By that Time he had finish'd his Winter-Garb,
the Weather was grown cold enough for him to put
it on; the frosty Season came on apace, in which
there fell such a Quantity of snow that he was
forc'd to make a Broom and sweep it away from a∣bout
his Habitation twice a Day; as also the same
he made to the Places he had Occasion to go to,
tossing the Snow on each Side, which before the
Winter was over did meet a Top; and so cover'd
it all the Way, which oblig'd him to keep within
Doors for a considerable Time, and melt Snow in∣stead
of Water, least going for some he might chance
to be buried among the Snow.</P>
<P>The Winter being over, and the Snow dissolv'd,
the gay Spring advances apace, offering Nature its
usual Assistance, repairing the Damages the late
Frost had done, which joyful Tidings made every
Thing smile; <HI>Quarll</HI> also finds himself reviv'd,
did take his former Walks, which the preceeding
bad Weather had kept him from, tho there had been
no considerable Storm the Winter before.</P>
<P>He having a Mind to view the Sea, being come
to the Outside of the North-west End of the Rock,
he sees at the Foot thereof something like Part of
the Body of a large hollow Tree, the Ends whereof
were stop'd with its own Pitch, and the Middle,
which was slit open from End to End, and kept
gaping by a Stick laid a cross.</P>
<P>This put him in mind of Canoes which the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
paddle up and down their Lakes and Rivers with,
and being on that Side of the Rock next to the
Island <HI>California,</HI> he fancy'd some of them were come
to visit his Island, tho' not many in Number, their
Canoes holding, at the most, but two Men, and for
the Generality one only; yet as some of these Peo∣ple
<PB N="222" REF="237"/>
are accounted great Thieves, daily robbing one
another, he hastens Home to secure what he had,
but was too late; they had been there already, and
had taken away the Cloaths he found in the Chest,
which being, by far, too little for him, hung need∣less
on a Pin behing his Door; had they been con∣tented
with that, he would have found no Miss; but
they carried away some of his fine Shells, and what
griev'd him most, the fine Bird he had taken such
Pains to dress and stuff, and Care to preserve, as al∣so
his Bow and Arrows.</P>
<P>Having miss'd these Things which he much valu∣ed,
he hastens to the Outside of the Rock, with his
long Staff in his Hand, in Hopes to light on them
before they could get into their Canoe; but hap∣pen'd
to come too late, they being already got near
Half a League from the Rock; yet they did not car∣ry
away their Theft, there arising some Wind,
which made the Sea something rough, did overset
their Canoe, so that what was in it was all lost, but
the two <HI>Indians,</HI> who most dexterously turn'd it on
its Bottom again, and with unexprimable Activity
leapt in it, one at the one Side, and the other at
the opposite, so the Canoe being trim'd at once,
they paddled out of his Sight.</P>
<P>Having seen as much of them as he could, he
walks to the North-east Side, in Order to see if he
could perceive any Effect of the high Wind which
happen'd the Night before.</P>
<P>Being come to the Outside of the Rock, he per∣ceives
at a Distance something like a large Chest,
but having no Lid on't, taking that to be the Pro∣duct
of some late Shipwrack, he greiv'd at the fatal
Accident; How long, said he, will covetousness de∣coy
Men to pursue Wealth at the Cost of their
precious Life? has not Nature provided every Na∣tion
and Country Sufficiency for its Inhabitants,
<PB N="223" REF="238"/>
that they most rove on this most dangerous and
perilous Sea, which may be titled <HI>Death's Dominions,</HI>
many perishing thereon, and not one on it being
safe.</P>
<P>As he was bewailing their Fate whom he ima∣gin'd
had been cast away, he sees two Men come
down the Rock, with each a Bundle in his Arms,
who went to that which he had taken to be a Chest,
and having put their Load in it, push'd it away till
come to deeper Water; then having got in it, with
a long Staff shov'd it off, till they could row to a
Long-boat that lay at some Distance behind a jot∣ting
Part of the Rock, which screen'd it from his
Sight, as also the Ship it did belong to.</P>
<P>The Sight of this much surpriz'd him, and made
him cease condolling others suppos'd Loss, to run
Home and examine his own, well knowing those
Bundles he saw carried away must needs belong to
him, there being no other Moveables in the Island,
but what was in his Lodge.</P>
<P>Being come Home he finds indeed what he sus∣pected,
those Villains had most sacrilegiously rifled
and ransack'd his Habitation, not leaving him so
much as one of the Mats to keep him poor Body
from the Ground; his Winter-Garb also is gone,
and what else they could find for their Use.</P>
<P>The Loss of those Things which he could not be
without, fill'd him with Sorrow; Now, said he,
I am in my first State of Being, naked I came into
the World, and naked shall I go out of't, so fell a∣weeping.</P>
<P>Having griev'd a while, Why, said he should I
thus cast my self down? is not Providence, who
gave me them, able to give me more? so having re∣solv'd
before Winter to replenish his Loss, he rests
himself contented, and gives the Ruffians evil Acti∣on
the best Construction he could. Now I think
<PB N="224" REF="239"/>
on't, said he, these surely are the Men, who about
twelve Months since, would charitably have carried
me hence, but could not for Want of necessary Im∣plements,
and now, being better provided, come to
accomplish their hospitable Design; but not finding
me, suppos'd I was either dead or gone; so took
away what was here of no Use; much good may
what they have got do them, and may it be of as
much Use to them as it was to me: Thus walks out
in Order to cut Grass to dry, and make himself new
Bedding and a Winter-Garb.</P>
<P>Having walk'd about Half a Mile, he perceives
the same Men coming towards the Pond, Heavens
be prais'd said he, here they be still; now
when they see I am not gone, nor willing to go
they will return my Things, which they are sen∣sible
I cannot do without; so goes up to them.</P>
<P>By that Time they had catch'd his two old
Ducks, which being pingion'd could not fly away as
the rest did: He was much vex'd to see the best of
his Stock thus taken away, yet as he thought they
were come to do him Service, he could grudge them
nothing, as would anywise gratifie so good an In∣tent;
so having return'd them Thanks for their
good Will, he told them he was very happy in the
Island, so made a Vow never to go out of it.</P>
<P>These being <HI>French</HI> Men, and of an Employ∣ment,
where their Politeness is of little Use, being
Fishermen, not understanding what he said, only
laugh'd in his Face, thus went on to the Purpose they
came about; so having as many of the Ducks as
they could get, they proceeded towards the House,
where they had seen the <HI>Antelopes,</HI> some of which
not running away at their Approach, they propos'd
to catch hold of them.</P>
<P>Being come to the Place where the us'd to seed,
which was near the Dwelling, the young ones not
<PB N="225" REF="240"/>
being us'd to see any Men in Cloathes, nor any Bo∣dy
but their Master, presently fled, but the two
old Ones, which he had bred up, were so tame, that
notwithstanding of the Strangers, they stood still;
only when the Men come to them, they crept closs
to him, which gave the Men Opportunity to lay
Hold on them, who, notwithstanding <HI>Quarll</HI>'s beg∣ging
and praying, they tied a Halter about their
Horns, and so barbarously led them away.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> was griev'd to the Heart to see his Dar∣lings,
which he had taken such Care to breed up,
and who were become the principal Part of his De∣light,
following him up and down, and by their
jumping and playing before him, often dispers'd me∣lancholly
Thoughts, all these endearing Qualificati∣ons
augmented his Grief to see them thus hail'd a∣way:
He weeps, and on his Knees begs they may
be left; and tho they understood not his Words,
his Actions were so expressive and moving, that
had they had the Humanity of Canabals, which
eat one another, they would have yielded to so
melting an Object, as the poor broken hearted <HI>Quarll</HI>
was; but the inflexible Boors went on, cruely hall∣ing
and draging the poor Creatures, who, as tho'
sensible of the Barbarity of the Act, did look back
to their afflicted Master, as craving his Assistance,
which at last so exasperated him, that he was seve∣ral
Times tempted to lay on the Ravishers with his
long Staff; but as often was stopt by the following
Consideration, Shall I, said he, be the Destruction
of my fellow-Creature, to rescue out of their Hands
Animals, of which I have an improving Store left,
and deprive them of their Healths, and perhaps of
their Lives, to recover what costs me nought? l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
them go with what they have, and the Merit of
their Deed be their Reward. Thus he walks about
melancholy, bemoaning his poor <HI>Antelopes</HI> Fate, and
<PB N="226" REF="241"/>
his own Misfortune; They were us'd to Liberty,
said he, which they now are depriv'd of, and so
which they will pine and die, which for their Sake
I cannot but wish, for Life without Liberty is a con∣tinual
Death, which holds during Life.</P>
<P>As he was walking thinking, as 'tis usual, after
the Loss of any Thing one loves, of the Pleasure
he had during the Enjoyment, the Ruffians, having
secur'd the poor Animals, came back with Ropes in
their Hands. What do they want next, said he,
have they not all they desire? would they carry a∣way
my Habitation also? sure they have no De∣sign
on my Person, if so they will not take it so
easily as they did my dear <HI>Antelopes;</HI> thus resolv'd
to exercise his Quarter-Staff, if they offer'd to lay
Hands on him. The Villains, whose Design was to
bind him, and so carry him away, seeing him arm'd
and resolute, did not judge it safe for them to ad∣vance
within the Reach of his Weapon, but keep
at some Distance, divining how to seize him.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who by their consulting, guest at their
Design, did not think proper to let them come to a
Resolution, so makes at the nearest, who immedi∣ately
takes to his Heels, and then to the next, who
immediately does the same; thus he follows them
about for a considerable Time; but they divided in
Order to trie him with running, till the Night ap∣proaching,
and the Wind rising, made them fear
their Retreat might be dangerous, if they deferr'd it;
so they went clear away, which being all he de∣sir'd,
he return'd assoon as he saw them in their
Long-boat, which they row'd to their Ship that lay
at Anchor some Distance from the Rocks.</P>
<P>These Wretches being gone, he returns Heavens
Thanks for his Deliverance; and as his Bridge had
favour'd their coming, he pulls it off, and only laid
it over when he had a Mind to view the Sea; so
<PB N="227" REF="242"/>
goes Home to eat a Bit, having not as yet broke his
Fast; so having eaten some of his Roots and Cheese,
and being wearied with hunting those Boors, he con∣sults
how to lie, his Bed and Beding being gone; as
also his Winter-Gown, and the Nights being as yet
cold; so, after a small Time of Consideration, he
concludes to lie in the Lodge, which was left vacant
by the stolen <HI>Antelopes</HI> Absennce, whose Litter be∣ing
made of the same Grass as his Mats were of, he
lay both soft and warm.</P>
<P>When laid down, being sore fatigu'd he soon fell
asleep; and as the Plunderers had the precceding
Day took up his Cares, they fill'd his Mind in the
Night; he has them continually before his Eyes,
sometimes with his beloved Antelopes in their pilfer∣ing
Hands, as other Times, barbarously hawling
them by the Horns, with a Halter, which they
ought to have about their own Necks. These
Acts of Austerity provoke his Anger, and urge him
on to Revenge; thus he lifts his Staff, which of a
sudden is turn'd into <HI>Hercules</HI>'s Club, startl'd to see
that wonderful Change, he stops from laying on the
intended Blow; rescuing, said he, my darling Ani∣mals
I shall lose my most pretious and inestimable
Peace of Mind, what can attone for the Life of a
Man? Whilst he was making those Reflections, the
Men got clear away with the Fowls and <HI>Antelopes,</HI>
so left him in deep melancholly. Thus as he was
bewailing his Loss, calling to Mind the agreeable
Pastimes they had often been to him, and the many
anxious Hours he had dispers'd with their Diversi∣on,
a grave Gentlewoman appear'd before him, of a
most agreeable, yet demure Countenance, dress'd in
plain Dove-colour'd Cloathes, in most Places
thread-bare, and in others patch'd with divese Sorts
of Stuffs, yet genteel and becoming; he starts at
her Appearing, wondering what she could come for,
<PB N="228" REF="243"/>
having nothing more to lose. I come not, said she,
to seek ought from thee, but to restore what thou
hast lost. He being overjoy'd at the Words, looks
about expecting his beloved <HI>Antelopes,</HI> and what else
the Men had taken away; but seeing nothing, he
thought that Vision proceeded from Vapours, which
the great Grief for his late Loss had occasion'd, so
falls a thinking till being a second Time interrupted
by her, bidding him look her in the Face. Be sa∣tisfied,
be satisfied Woman, said he, why I neither
know thee nor what thou meanest. Well then, re∣ply'd
she, I'll inform thee of both; I am Patience,
whom all the World strive to grieve, and whom
none can provoke, and what I promise to restore
thee is Content, which you throw away after
worthless Things; so she evanishes, at which he a∣wakes.</P>
<P>Having made Reflections upon the latter Part of
his Dream, the first Part thereof being but a Repe∣tition
of what happen'd the Days before, he makes
this Application; This, said he, is a Check for my
discomposing that Peace upon such a freevolous
Account, which by Providence was intended I
should enjoy, having supplied me with all Necessa∣ries
to maintain it; he therefore makes a Resoluti∣on
never to be vex'd, let what will happen, but
with Patience submit to the will of GOD, who has
the Direction of all Things; so, having paid his
usual Devotion, he goes into the Kitchen, in Or∣der
to break Fast, and then to take his accustomary
Walk. Whilst he was eating there arose a Noise
in the Air, as proceeding from a Quantity of Rooks,
Jackdaws, Crows, and such like Birds, whole com∣mon
Notes he was acquainted with, and as the
Noise approach'd, he had the Curiosity to go and
see what was the Matter, but was prevented by the
coming of a large Fowl which flew over his Head,
<PB N="229" REF="244"/>
as he was going out; he turn'd back to admire the
Bird, whose Beauty seiz'd him with Admiration;
the Pleasure of seeing so charming a Creature quite
put out of his Mind the Curiosity of looking from
whence proceeded the disagreeable Noise without,
which easing as soon as the Bird was shelter'd, made
him imagine those carrion Birds had been a chasing
that beautiful Fowl, who seeing it self out of Dan∣ger
stood still very calm and compos'd, which gave
him the Opportunity of making a Discussion of e∣very
dividual Agreement as compos'd so delight∣ful
an Object, it was the Bigness and Form of a
Swan, almost headed like it, only the Bill was not
so long nor so broad, and red like Coral; his Eyes,
like those of a Hawk, his Head of a Mazarine
Blew, and on the Top of it a Tuff of shining gold-colour'd
Feathers, which did spread over it, hang∣ing
near three Inches beyond all round; its Breast,
Face, and Part of its Neck Milk-white, couriously
speckled with small black Spots, a Gold-colour'd
Circle about it, its Back and Neck behind of a fine
Crimson speckled with Purple, its Legs and Feet the
same Colour of its Bill, its Tail long and round,
spreading like that of a Peacock, compos'd of six
Rows of Feathers all of different Colours, which
made a most delightful Mixture.</P>
<P>Having spent several Minutes admiring the Bird,
he lays Pease and crumbled Roots both roasted and
boil'd before it, as also Water in a Shell; so with∣drew
to give it Liberty to eat and drink; and stood
out peeping to see what it would do, who, being a∣lone,
having look'd about him, picks a few Pease
and drinks heartily, then walks towards the Door,
in a composing and easy Manner, much like that
of a Cock.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> being at the Outside, was of twenty Minds
whether he should detain him or let him go; his
<PB N="230" REF="245"/>
Affection for that admirable Creature equally prompts
him to both; he cannot bear the Thoughts of part∣ing
with so lovely an Object, nor harbour that of
depriving it of its Liberty, which it so implicitly
did intrust him withal. Thus, after a small Pause,
Generosity prevails over self-Pleasure, why should I,
said he, make the Place of its Refuge its Prison? so
makes Room for him to go, who, with a slow Pace,
walks out; and having look'd about him a small
Time, mounts up a considerable Height, then takes
its Course North-west.</P>
<P>The Bird being gone out of Sight, he made Re∣flections
on the Adventure, which he judges to be a
Prognostick of some Rebellion or revolution in <HI>Eu∣rope;</HI>
so having recommended his native Country
to the Protection of Heavens, begging for a Conti∣nuation
of Peace, and an End of those unhappy
Divisions, which often prove the Ruin of Nations;
he goes and sets down in his Memorial-Book the
Transactions of that Year being 1689, and the I5th
since his being in the Island, which prov'd more
fruitful in Events than any of the preceeding;
the Picture which he had drawn of the ter∣rible
Sea-Monster, being against his Wall he
accustom'd himself with the frightful Object that
constantly disturb'd his Mind, he draws that of the
two Ruffians, committing their Barbarity, and
hangs it by the Place; the Idea whereof being
to him more obnoxious than the preceeding, he
could not suffer it to be long in his Sight so
takes it down, and draws on the Back-side of it,
the Villains on a Gibbet, now, said he, this
being what ought to be the End and Explana∣tion
of the History, shall now be the right Side
of the Picture.</P>
<P>There happening nothing the Remainder of the
Year, worthy of Record, he imploys it in his ac∣customary
<PB N="231" REF="246"/>
Occupations, as pruning and watering
his Lodge and Dairy, making his Mats to lie on,
as also his Winter-Garb, every Day milking his
Antelopes and Goats, making now and then Butter
and Cheese, attending his Nets, and such like neces∣sary
Imployment.</P>
<P>The mean Time, the <HI>French</HI> Mariners, who pro∣bably
got Money by what they had taken from him
the Year before, return'd, it being much about the
same Season, and being resolv'd to take him away,
and all they could make any Thiug of, out of the
Island, were provided with Hands and Implements
to accomplish their Design; as Ropes to bind what
they could get alive, and Guns to shoot what they
could not come at, Saws and Hatchets to cut down
Logwood aud Brazil, Pick-Ax's and Shovels to dig
up Oris-Roots and others of worth, which they
imagin'd the Island did produce; likewise flat-bot∣tom'd
Boats to tow in shallow Water, where others
could not come, and thus by degrees to load their
Ship with Booty; but ever-watchful Providence
blasted their evil Projects, and confounded their De∣vices,
at the very Instant they thought themselves
sure of Success: The Implements in a flat-bottom'd
Boat were tow'd to the very Foot of the Rock, by
a young Fellow, who being lighter than a Man, was
thought fittest to go with the Tools, which pretty
well loaded the Boat.</P>
<P>Their Materials being landed to their great Sa∣tisfaction,
the Men on Board embark'd in two more
of the same sort of Boats, but were no sooner in 'em,
but a Storm arose, which dash'd their slender Bot∣tom
to Pieces, and wash'd them into the Sea, in
which they perish'd, also over-set the flat-bottom'd
Boat on Shore, with the Load and Lad underneath
it.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="247"/>
The Storm being over, which lasted from about
eight in the Morning, till almost twelve at Noon,
when <HI>Quarll,</HI> according to his Custom, went to see
if he could perceive any Damage done by the late
Tempest, and if any distress'd by it stood in want
of help.</P>
<P>Being at that side of the Rock he us'd to visit, he
could see nothing but a few Fishes and Shells the Sea
had left in the Clifts; if this, said he, be all the
Damage that has been done, make me thankful, it
will recruit me with fresh Fish and Utensils; so he
goes on to the N. W. part, where he sees a batter'd
Boat, floating with the Keel upwards, this, said he,
boades some Mischief, but thought it not to be of
any Consequence; having gone about fifty Yards
further, he 'spies a small Barrel at the Foot of the
Rock, with several Planks and Fragments of a Ship,
floating with the Tide. Alas! said he, these are
too evident Proofs of a Shipwreck, to hope other∣wise;
as he was looking about, he hears a Voice
cry out, much like that of a Man, at some distance
behind a Part of the Rock; being advanc'd a small
matter, beyond where he was, Heaven's be prais'd,
said he, there is some Body, whom I am luckily
come to save, and he most fortunately come to be
my Companion, I cannot but rejoyce at the Event,
tho' I heartily grieve for the Accident; so hastens
to the Place where he thought the Cries came from,
which, as he advanc'd he could discern to be too
shrill for a Man's Voice, certainly, said he, this must
be some Woman by the Noise. This sets his Blood
a Glowing, his Heart alters its Motion; Now, said
he, joyful Providence has compleated my Happiness,
I shall have a Companion and a help Mate, and go's
on with fresh Vigour, as tho' he had recover'd his
Strength, and got new Limbs: The rough and sa∣vage
Rock, which was before, in a Manner inacces∣sible,
<PB N="233" REF="248"/>
is now made easy to Walk; he climbs the
high Places with Activity, and goes down the steep
as nimbly, and soon arrives where he judg'd the
Person to be, yet seeing nothing, but what he took
to be a Chest, begun to be disheartn'd, sure, said
he, this is not a second Allusion, to decoy my
Fancy after what is not to be had! Thus his Joy
of a sudden turn'd into a deep Melancholy; but
the Creature underneath, who having heard some
Noise near at hand, ceas'd crying, to liften, yet see∣ing
no Body come, cries out again, something loud∣er
than before.</P>
<P>This reviv'd him quite and repeals his Hopes; it
is a Woman, said he, and in that Chest, so was a
going to break it open, but stops of a Suddain;
What am I going to do? How do I know the Cause
of her being thus lock'd up, tho' Women are in
a Manner become a Merchandize, yet they never
are pack'd up or chested? She must be in there for
a Punishment, which in some Countries is inflicted
on Witches. The Boy, who heard a Voice calls
out in <HI>French,</HI> which <HI>Quarll</HI> not understanding, he
was afraid to let it out; but at his mentioning <HI>Christ</HI>
being intelligible to him, made him change his
Opinion, for <HI>Christ</HI> his sake doth she say? That
holy Name Witches seldom make Use of; however
in that Name I'll let her out, if she be under Con∣demnation,
was I not so? Had she by Heaven been
decreed to die, she would not been here; so with
his Staff he endeavour'd to break that which he took
to be the Lid of the Chest, but prov'd the Bottom;
and as he was striking, the Boy underneath calling
to him to turn it up, did thrust his Hand under the
Side, which he perceiving, tho he understood him
not, stood still, finding his Mistake, this<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, said he,
is a flat-bottom'd Boat such as the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> us'd the
Year before, when they came and plunder'd me,
<PB N="234" REF="249"/>
now, am I safe if I turn it up? Doubtless they are
come in greater Numbers; so pauses a while, but
the Lad (whom he took to be a Woman) still con∣tinuing
his moan, he was mov'd to Compassion,
and having consider'd the Boat could not hold any
great Number, he ventures, let what will come on't,
or who will be under; for the poor Woman's sake
I'll relieve them, there cannot be many Men, how∣ever,
I'll let but one out at a Time, if he be mis∣chievious
I'm able to deal with him; so he puts the
End of his Staff where he had seen the hand, and
litfs it up about a Foot from the Ground, out or the
opening immediately creeps out the Boy, who on
his Knees falls a Begging and Weeping, expecting
Death every Moment, as being the merited Punish∣ment
for the evil Purpose he was come about: <HI>Quarll</HI>
who expected there was a Woman besides, fearing
the Gap the Youth came out at, would be too un∣easy
for her to come thro', made Motions for the
Boy to help him, iu order to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the Boat on its
Bottom, which he did: <HI>Quarll</HI> seeing the Imple∣ments
instead of the Woman, was as much vex'd as
disappointed, his Countenance changes, sometimes
looks at the Things, and then at the Boy, who see∣ing
him appear Angry, thought of nothing but
present Death, again falls on his Knees, holding up
his Hands, almost drown'd in Tears, begging for
Mercy in such a moving Manner, that <HI>Quarll</HI> could
not forbear shedding some Tears, and tho' the late
Disappointment of his propos'd Happiness, and the
Sight of the Preparations made for his intended
Ruin, had moved him to Anger against that mer∣cenary
Nation; he helps the young Fellow up by
the Hand, and the Night coming on a Pace, he takes
one of the Hatchets that lay by, and gave another
to the Boy, then falls a knocking the Boat to pieces,
and directed him to do the same, which accordingly
he did.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="250"/>
The Boat being demolish'd, they carried the
Boards up higher on the Rock, as also the Rest of
the Things, least in the Night some Storm should
raise as might wash them back into the Sea, it being
then too late to bring them away: Having done
they each of them took up what they could carry,
and to went Home. The young <HI>Frenchman</HI> finding
a kinder Treatment then either he deserved or ex∣pected
was extraordinary submissive and tractable,
which made <HI>Quarll</HI> the more kind and mild; so
instead of condemning his his evil Attempt, com∣miserated
his Misfortune, and in room of Resent∣ment
shew'd him Kindness; thus having given him
of what he had to eat, he puts him to Bed in the
Lodge, wherein he did lie, till he had got his Mats
made up, then went to Bed himself, but could not
sleep for thinking of his late Disappointment, which
did intercept those Pleasures he so much depended
on, thinking himself sure of a Female Partner, who
in sharing Happiness with him, would have much
added to his Bliss,</P>
<P>Having toss'd and tumbl'd a considerable Time,
he begins to be heavy spirited, Nature is fatigu'd
and must be refresh'd; thus he falls a sleep, and as
his Hopes the preceeding Day had indulg'd his
Desires, his Mind his so impress'd in the Night
with the Idea of the Female Object, that he dreams
he has her by his Side, condoling her for the Dan∣gers
she has gone thro', congratulating her lucky
Escape, and greeting her happy Arrival into so
blessed an Abode.</P>
<P>Thus expressing his Joy, in possessing the only
Object as could compleat his Happiness, with all the
Softness and Eloquence the most passionate Love
can impress, he reaches out his Arms to embrace the
lovely Phantom his Inclination had breed in his
Imagination; but having grop'd a while, and find∣ing
<PB N="236" REF="251"/>
nothing, he starts out of his sleep at this most
shocking Disappointment.</P>
<P>Being awak'd, the late delusive pleasures call'd to
his Mind the real, which he had formerly enjoy'd
and which he then did hanker after: What is Man,
said he, without that Part of himself, out of which
God made him a Mate? <HI>Adam,</HI> who tho' possessing
all the World, was still wanting, till he had a Wo∣man
to keep him Company; in this melancholy
Disposition he again falls a sleep, and dreams a-fresh
in which his Imagination gluts his Inclination with
those Pleasures, it so much desir'd; Fruition to him
is but like Liquor to a Man sick of a violent Fever,
which only for a Minute quenches his Heat, but
augments the Distemper; so at last destroys the
Patient; excessive Love is but short-liv'd, what is
violent is not lasting, Time with Pleasure runs fast
away, but dwells long with Sorrow, Cares weakens
Love, and Indifferences breeds Discontent, then Jar∣ings
follow which introduces Division; the Mother
of Poverty.</P>
<P>These dismal Accidents, incumbent to unconsi∣derate
Love, coming into the amorous Dreamer's
Mind, whose great Heat being quench'd, took time
to consider his Condition, and seeing himself liable
to them, is struck with such a Fear as blots all Plea∣sures
out of his Thoughts, and fills them with
dread of feutur Cares, which he unadvisedly
run himself into, and all for the Sake of a short
Pleasure.</P>
<P>Starting out of his Sleep at the Approach of those
sad Troubles, he returns Heaven Thanks that it was
but a Dream, and begs Pardon for having given so
much way to the Concupiscence of Flesh; so gets
up, tho' sooner than ordinary, lest he should fall
a Sleep, and dream again of Women.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="252"/>
Having walk'd about till he thought it Time for
the Boy to rise, he calls him up, and takes him to
the Place that he usually went every Morning and
Evening to sing Psalms; where the Youth being
come, and hearing so many different Voices, and
seeing no Body, was scar'd out of his Wits, and took
to his Heels, making towards the Rock as fast as he
could; but as he was not acquainted with the easi∣est
and most practicable Parts thereof, <HI>Quarll</HI> had
made an End of his Psalm, and overtook him be∣fore
he could get to the Sea-Side, where he certain∣ly
would have cast himself into with the Fright;
but <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Coming, who, by the Boy's Staring,
guest his Disorder, not having the Benefit of the
Language, endeavour'd to calm him by his pleasing
Countenance; so prevented his drowning himself;
but could not keep off a violent Fit, the Fright
had occasion'd, which held him several Mi∣nutes.</P>
<P>The Fit being over, he and the Boy took a∣way,
at diverse Times, the Remains of the Chest,
and of what was in it, which they could not car∣ry
Home the Day before; so taking up two Guns,
Now, said he these unlucky Instruments, which
were intended for Destruction, shall be employ'd for
the Preservation of that they were to destroy; so
takes them to his Lodge, and sets them at each
Side of the Door; then being Dinner-Time, he
strikes a Light, and sets the Boy to make a Fire,
whilst he made some of the Fish fit to fry, which
he pick'd up upon the Rock the Evening before;
then takes dripping he sav'd when he roasted any
Flesh, to fry them withal. The Boy, who had liv'd
some Time in <HI>Holland,</HI> where they use much But∣ter,
seeing Dripping employ'd in Room thereof,
thought to please his Master in making some; and
as he had seen Milk and Cream in the Dairy-Ar∣bour,
<PB N="238" REF="253"/>
wanting a Churn only; there being a small
Roundlet lying by empty, he takes one of the Ends
of it, in which the next Day he beat Butter.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> seing the Youth industrious, begins to fan∣cy
him, notwithstanding the Aversion he had con∣ceiv'd
for his Nation, ever since the ill Treatment
he had receiv'd from his Country Men; and as
Speech is one of the most necessary Faculties to
breed and maintain Fellowship, he took Pains to
teach him <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The Lad, being acute and ingenious, was soon
made to understand it, and in six Months capable
to speak it sufficiently, so as to give his Master a
Relation of his late coming, and to what Intent.
The Men, said he, who about one Year since carried
away from hence some Antelopes, with extraordi∣nary
Ducks, and several Rarities, which they said
did belong to a monstruous. <HI>English</HI> Hermit, whose
Hair and Bard cover'd all his Body, having got a
grat deal of Money by shewing of them, did en∣courage
others to come; so several joining toge∣ther,
hir'd a Ship to fetch away the Hermit, and
what else they could find, therefore brought with
them Tools, and Guns to shoot what they could not
take alive. Barbarous Wretches, reply'd he, to
kill my dear Antelopes and Ducks! pray what did
they intend to do with me? Why, said the Boy,
to make a Show of you. To make a Show of me!
sordid Wretches, is a Christian then such a Rarity
amongst them? Well, and what were the Saws and
Hatchets for? To cut down your House, which
they intended to make a drinking Booth of. Ho,
monstruous! what Time and Nature have been fif∣teen
Years in compleating, they would have ruin'd
in a Moment; well, Thanks to Providence, their e∣vil
Design is averted. Pray, what is become of those
sacrilegious Persons? They are all drown'd, said
<PB N="239" REF="254"/>
the Boy. Then replies he, the Heavens are satisfy'd,
and I aveng'd; but how came thou to escape, for
thou wast with them? No, reply'd the Youth, I
was upon the Rock when their Boat was dash'd a∣gainst
it, and was over-set with the same Sea, under
the flat bottom'd Boat, where you found me. That
was a happy Overset for thee; well, is there no Gra∣titude
due to Providence for thy Escape? due to
Providence, said he, why, I thought you had sav'd
me? I'm sure you let me out. Yes, reply'd <HI>Quarll,</HI>
but I was sent by Providence for that Purpose.
That was kindly done to said the Boy, well, when,
I see him I will thank him; doth he live here a∣bout?
Poor ignorant Creature, replied <HI>Quarll,</HI> why,
Providence is every where; what! didst thou ne∣ver
hear of Providence, what Religion art thou?
Religion, answer'd the Youth, I don't know what
you mean, I am a Fisherman by Trade, which my
Father did live by. Well, said <HI>Quarll,</HI> did he teach
thee nothing else, no Prayers? Prayers, reply'd the
Lad, why, Fishermen have no Time to pray, that's
for them who have nothing else to do, poor Folk
must work and get Money, that's the Way of our
Town, Covetous Wretches! Well, said he, I
grudge them not of what they possess, since its all
the Happiness they aspire at; but thou shalt Iearn
to pray, which will be of far more Advantage to
thee than Work, both here and hereafter; so from
that Time begins to teach him the Lord's Prayer
and the ten Commandments, as also the Principles
of the Christian Religion: All which Instructions
the Youth taking readily, won his Affection the
more; and likewise taught him to sing Psalms,
which qualified him the more to be his Companion
in spiritual Exercises, as well as in temporal Occu∣pations.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="255"/>
Now having Company, he is oblig'd to enlarge
his Bed; the Lodge being wanting for his Ante∣lopes,
against Breeding Time, so adds to his Matts;
his other Provisions also wanting to be augmented,
and he having both Tools and Boards, out of the
flat-Boat which he had taken to Pieces; he and the
Lad went about making large Boxes to salt Flesh
and Fish in; then with the Boards that
were left they made a Table for his Dwelling that
he had before, and one for his Kitchen, as also
Shelves in the Room of those that were made of
Wicker; then having recruited his Shell-Utincils
that were stolen the Year before. He was compleat∣ly
furnish'd with all Manner of Conveniencies, and
Providence supplying him daily with other Ne∣cessaries,
there was no Room left him for Wishes,
but for Thanksgiving, which they most religiously
daily paid.</P>
<P>In this most happy State they liv'd in Peace, and
Concord the Space of ten Year, unanimously do∣ing
what was to be done, as it lay in each of their
Way, without relying on one another.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who before, tho' alone, and depriv'd of
Society (the principal Comfort of Life) thought
himself bless'd, now cannot express his Happiness,
there being none in the World to be compar'd to
it, heartily praying he might find no Alteration
till Death; but the young Man not having met
with so many Disappointments in the World as he,
had not quite withdrawn his Affections from it;
his Mind sometimes will run upon his native Coun∣try
where he has left his Relations, and where he can∣not
help wishing to be himself: Thus, Opportuni∣ty
offering it self one Day as he went to get Oy∣sters,
to make Sauce for some fresh God-Fish which
<HI>Quarll</HI> was dressing, he saw at a Distance a Ship, at
which his Heart fell a panting, his Pulses double
<PB N="241" REF="256"/>
their Motion, his Blood glows warmer and warmer,
till at last inflam'd with desire of getting at it, he
lays down the Bag he brought to put the Oysters
in, as also the Instrument to drudge them up with;
and takes to swiming: The Men on Board having
'spy'd him out, sent their Boat to take him up; so
he went away without taking his Leave of him he had
receiv'd so much Good of; who having waited a con∣siderable
Time, fearing some Accident would befal
him, leaves his Cooking, and goes to fee for him;
and being come at the Place where he was to get
the Oysters, he sees the Bag and Instrument lie,
and no Body with them; having call'd several
Times, without being answer'd, various racking
Fears tortur'd his Mind, sometimes he doubts he is
fallen in some Hole in the Rock, there being many
near that Place where the Oysters were; so with
his Staff, which he always carried with him when
he went Abroad, at the other Side of the Rock, he
grabled in every one round the Place, and feel∣ing
nothing, he concludes some Sea-Monster had
stolen him away; so falls a weeping, condemning
himself as the Cause of this fatal Accident, resolv∣ing
for the Future to punish himself by denying,
his Appetite, and only eat to support Nature, and
not to please his Palate,</P>
<P>Having given over Hopes of getting him again, re∣turns
Home in the greatest of Afflictions, resolving
to fast till that Time, the next Day; but happening
to look West-ward, in which was the Point the
Wind did stand, he perceives sometheing like a
Boat at a great Distance; so wipes the Tears off
his Eyes, which offuscated his Sight; then looking
stedfastly, he discovers a Sail beyond it, which
quite alter'd the Motive of his former Fear; no
Monster, said he, hath devour'd him, 'tis too plain
a Case that he has villainously left me; but what
<PB N="242" REF="257"/>
could I expect of his Son, who had projected such E∣vil
against me? so went Home, and made an End
of dressing his Dinner, and afterwards hangs up the
Picture which he had taken down upon his Account,
being the true Emblem of what he deserv'd (so re∣sting
himself contented, (being but as he was before,
and rather better) having more Conveniencies, and
Tools to till his Ground, and dig up his Roots
with; so, having recommended himself to Provi∣dence,
he takes his usual Works and Recreations,
resolving that no Cares should mar his Happiness
for the Future, being out of all those unresistable
Temptations Way, of which the World abounds in,
and daily lay the best Mens Hopes in Jeopardy.</P>
<P>Being again alone, the whole Business of the
House lies upon his Hands; he now must prune,
and trim his Habitation, that daily Harbours him,
being made of fine growing Plants which yearly
shoot out young Branches; so makes 'em grow
out of Shape; he must also till the Ground, set
and gather his Pease and Beans in their Season,
milk and feed his <HI>Antelopes</HI> daily, make Butter and
Cheese at proper Time, dig up his Roots, fetch in
Fuel and Water, when wanted, attend his Nets, go
Eagle-nesting, and every Day dress his own Victu∣als;
all which necessary Occupations, besides the
Time dedicated for Morning and Evening Devo∣tions,
did keep him wholly employ'd, which made
his renew'd Solitude less irksome, and having walk∣ed
all that Afternoon to divert his Thoughts, ad∣miring
all the Way the wonderful Works of Na∣ture,
both in the surprizing Rocks which surroun∣ded
the Island, and in the delightful Creatures, and
admirable Plants that are in it.</P>
<P>Being weary with Walking, he returns Home
thanking kind Providence for settling him in so
blessed a Place, and in his Way calls at his invisi∣ble
<PB N="243" REF="258"/>
Quiere, where having sung a thanksgiving Psalm,
aid his usual Evening Hymn, he goes to Supper,
and then to Bed, with a throughly contented Mind,
which occasions pleasant Dreams to entertain his
Thoughts.</P>
<P>During his Sleep his Fancy is delighted with be∣ing
in Nature's Garden of Pleasure, where none but
her Friends are permitted to enter.</P>
<P>The Place appear'd very spacious, and of an ad∣mirable
Form, full of all Sorts of Nature's Works,
both Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals, every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vidual
thing excelling Perfection, and tho' some
were distant, yet all appear'd as at Hand.</P>
<P>The lofty Trees, which stood on a level Ground,
cover'd with curious Grass, embaml'd with many
different colour'd Flowers, exceeding in Beauty any
Carpet that the most expert Artist could make, did
spread their branchy Arms over Creatures of all
Kinds, which lay beneath their delightful Shades:
There the bold Lyon lies by the innocent Lamb,
the fierce Panther wear the harmless Sheep, the ra∣venous
Woolf with the mild Goat, Leopard and
Deer, Tyger and Hare repos'd together in Peace; on
the Trees Eagles, Vultures, Falcons, and Hawks,
quietly did pearch, with the Turtle and the
Dove.</P>
<P>These most agreeable Objects, join'd with the
delightful Noise of the Fountains falling into their
Basins, and the purling Streams running their
Course, together with the various harmonious
Notes of diverse Kinds of Singinig-Birds, did put
him into an Ecstasie; sure, said he, this is the Gar∣den
of <HI>Eden,</HI> out of which unfortunate <HI>Adam</HI> was
cast after his Fall, as being a Dwelling only for
Innocence.</P>
<P>Having walk'd a little Way, there being on every
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e curious Lanes, every one affording new Ob∣jects
<PB N="244" REF="259"/>
of Admiration; he comes to a Walk, edg'd
with Orange and Lemon Trees, full of Fruit and
Blossoms, at the Foot of which was a narrow Bank,
border'd with Junquils, Tuberoses, Jacents, and o∣ther
delightful Flowers, both for Sight and Smell:
At the End of it there was an Arbour of the same,
but so beautiful, that at first Sight he took it for a
Tapestery, the most expert Artist had exerted him∣self
in making, to shew the Curiosity of Trade and
Greatness of his Skill: In it there sat three Ladies
of uncommon Beauty; the middlemost, who was
the lustiest, appear'd to be the eldest, being of a
most fedate Countenance, a moderate Number of
Years having both establish'd her Judgment and set∣tled
her Features; she, at her Right-hand, seem'd
to be of a weaker Constitution; she had in her
Hand an Olive-Branch bearing Fruit, which, when
gathered, was immediately succeeded with Blossom;
so that it never was without the one or the other.
The Lady who fat on the left Side was more jolly
and gay, yet look'd somewhat careful; she had in
her Hand a long Vessel, broad at one End, and sharp
at the other like a Horn, bending towards the Point,
full of all Sorts of Fruits.</P>
<P>Having stood still a short Space of Time, look∣ing
at those Ladies, thinking it ill Manners to inter∣rupt
their Conversation; they perceiving his Mo∣desty
would not permit him to advance, but got up
and went another Way, to give him the Opportu∣nity
of viewing the Garden; so he went quite round,
till come to the Place he first did begin his Walk,
where he saw a stately Cock, of an extraordinary
Size, strutting from Animal to Animal, taking from
most of them something, whilst they were asleep,
which having secur'd, he falls a crowing in such a
loud Manner, that he startled all the other Crea∣tures;
who being awake, and every one missing
<PB N="245" REF="260"/>
something, challeng'd him with it, who having
crow'd a second Time in an insulting and daring
manner, struted most haughtily away, at which the
Losers being much offended, consulted together on
Means to retake by Force, what he had in so clan∣destine
a Manner taken from them, so chose the
Lion for their Director; but the watchful Cock,
who whilst they were indulging themselves, had
carefully made sufficient Provision to maintain what
he had done, so bid them all Defiance.</P>
<P>There happening a great Noise of Squeeling,
wak'd him out of his Dream, and his Mind being
impress'd with Notions of War, which at first seiz'd
him with Terror, but being something Settled, and
the Noise still continuing, he perceiv'd it did pro∣ceed
from the two different Kinds of Monkeys in
the Island, who were fighting for the wild Pomgra∣nates
which the high Wind had shook off the Trees
the preceeding Night, which prov'd very boistrous.</P>
<P>Having guess'd the Occasion of their Debate, he
gets up, in Order to go and quell their Difference,
by dividing amongst them the Cause thereof; so
getting up, he opens the Door, at the Out-side of
which an old Monkey of each sort, were quietly
waiting his Levy, to intice him to come, as he once
did before, and put an End to their bloody War.</P>
<P>He was not a little surpriz'd to see two such in∣veterate
Enemies, who at other times never meet
without fighting, at that Juncture agree so well.</P>
<P>That most surprizing Sign of Reason in those
Brutes, who knowing his Decision would cease their
Comrades Difference, came to implore it, which put
him upon these Reflections; would Princes, said he,
be but reasonable, as those who by Nature are ir∣rational,
how much Blood and Money would be
saved? Having admired the Uneasiness of those
poor Creatures, who still did go a few Steps for∣ward
<PB N="246" REF="261"/>
and then backward to him; he was in Hopes
to decay one or both into his Lodge, by throwing
Meat to them; but those Example-giving-Animals,
hearing their Fellows in Trouble, had no regard to
their seperate Interest, so took no Notice of what he
gave them, but kept moving to and again with all
the Tokens of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>easiness they could Express;
which so mov'd him, that he hasten'd to the Place,
where his Presence caus'd immediately a Cessation
of Arms, and each Party mov'd a considerable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> each other, waiting his sharing the
Wind-al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; which being done, they quietly took
that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eap as lay next each Kind, so went to their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ters.</P>
<P>This Accident, which in some manner made out
his Dream of Wars, brought it also fresh into his
Mind, which being full of Cares about his Country,
whom he much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear'd, if any should happen in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
would be involv'd therein; and calling to Re∣membrance
the indigent Disposition he left it in, he
fear'd it would lay it open to some usurping Prince's
Power; but lest further Speculation should occasion
evil Prognoscication as may disturb his Peace, so
leaves the Event of all Things to the Direction of
Providence, and so goes Home to set down his
Dream, and the Year he dream'd it, which was in
1690.</P>
<P>Fourteen Years more being past, every Thing
keeping its natural Course, there happening no∣thing
extrordinary, each succeeding Year renoving
the Pleasures the Preceeding did produce: Thunders
and high Winds being frequent, tho' not equally
violent, he thought it not material to Record them,
or their Effects, as blowing and throwing Fishes,
Shells, empty Vessels, batter'd Chests, &amp;c. upon
the Rock, only Transactions and Events wonderful
and uncommon, and there happening a most sur∣prizing
<PB N="247" REF="262"/>
one a few Days after, which tho' of no great
Moment, is as worthy of Record as any of far
greater Concern, being a wonderful Effect of Pro∣vidence,
manifested in a miraculous Manner, tho'
not to be said Supernatural.</P>
<P>One Morning, when he had roasted a Parcel of
those Roots, which he us'd to eat instead of Bread,
and this he commonly did once a Week, eating best
when Stale, having spread them on his Table and
Chest to cool, he went out to walk, leaving his
Door open to let the Air in.</P>
<P>His Walk, tho' grac'd with all the Agreements
Nature could adorn it withal to make it delightful,
a Grass Carpet, imbroider'd with beautiful Flowers
of many different Colours and Smell under his Feet
to tread on; before and on each side of him, was
fine lofty Trees of various Forms and Height,
cloath'd with pleasant green Leaves trim'd with rich
Blossoms of many Colours to divert his Eye; a
Number of several sorts of melodious Singing-Birds
pearching in their most lovely Shades, as tho' Na∣ture
had studied to excell Man's brightest Imagina∣tion
and Exquisiteness of Art; yet all these Profuse∣nesses
of Nature's Wonder, are not sufficient to keep
away or expell anxious Thoughts from his Mind;
it runs upon his two dear Antelopes, the darling
Heads of his present Stock, whom he took such
care to bring up, and were become so engaging al∣ways
attending him in those fine Walks, adding by
their swift Races, active Leapings, and other un∣common
Diversions to the natural Pleasantness of
the Place, which now, by their most lamented Ab∣sence,
is become a dull <HI>Memorandum</HI> of the barba∣rous
Manner they were ravish'd away from him.</P>
<P>In these melancholy Thoughts, which his Lone∣somness
every now and then did create, he returns
Home, where Providence had provided a Remedy
<PB N="248" REF="263"/>
for his Grievance; a Companion far exceeding any
he ever he had, waits his return, which was a beau∣tiful
Monkey of the finest Kind, and the most com∣pleat
of the Sort, as tho' made to manifest the un∣parallel'd
Skill of Nature, is sent him by Providence
to dissipate his Melancholy.</P>
<P>Being come to his Lodge, and beholding that
wonderful Creature, and in his own Possession, being
at the furthest End of it, and he at the Enterance
thereof, to oppose its flight, if offer'd, he is at once
fill'd with Joy and Admiration; long, said he, I
endeavour'd in vain to get one, and would have
been glad of any, tho' of the worst Kind, and even
the meanest of the Sort, and here kind Providence
has sent me one of an unparellel'd Beauty.</P>
<P>Having a considerable Time admir'd the Beast,
who all the while stood unconcern'd, now and then
eating of the Roots that lay before him, he shuts
the Door and goes in, with a Resolution of staying
within all Day, in order to tame him, which he hop'd
would be no difficult Matter, his Disposition be∣ing
already pretty familiar, little thinking, that
Providence, who sent him there, had already qual∣lify'd
him for the Commission he bore; which hav∣ving
found out by the Creatur's surprizing Docility,
he returns his Benefactor his most hearty Thanks
for that miraculous Gift.</P>
<P>This most wonderful Animal, having by its sur∣prizing
Tractability and good Nature join'd, to its
matchless Handsomness, gain'd its Master's Love,
beyond what is usual to place on any sort of Beasts,
he thought himself double recompenc'd for all his
former Losses, especially for that of his late ungrat∣ful
Companion, who notwithstanding all the Obli∣gations
he held from him, basely left him, at a
Time he might be most helpful; and as he fancied
his dear <HI>Beaufidelle</HI> (for so be call'd that admirable
<PB N="249" REF="264"/>
Creature) had some sort of Resemblance to the Pict∣ture
he dream'd of him, he takes it down, thinking
it unjust to bear in his Sight, that vile Object could
not any wise claim a Likeness to so worthy a Crea∣ture
as his beloved Monkey.</P>
<P>One Day as this lovely Animal was officiating
the Charge, it had of its own accord taken, being
gone for Wood, as wont to do when wanted, he
finds in his Way a wild Pomgranate, whose extra∣traordinary
size and weight had caus'd to fall off
the Tree, he takes it Home, and then returns for
his Faggot, in which time <HI>Quarll,</HI> wishing the
Goodness of the Inside might answer its outward
Beauty, cuts it open, and finding it of a dull Lucti∣tiousness
too flat for eating, imagin'd it might be
used with things, of an Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Sharp taste; so
having boild some Water he puts it into a Vessel
with a sort of an Herb, which is of the Taste and
Nature of Creasses, and some of the Pomgranate, so
lets them infuse some time, now and then stirring
it, which the Monkey having taken Notice off did
the same, but one very hot Day happening to lay
the Vessel in the Sun, which made it turn sower.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll,</HI> who very much wanted Vinegar in his
Sauces, was well pleas'd with the Accident, and so
continu'd the souring on't, which proving excellent,
he made a five Gallon Vessel of it, having several,
which at times he found upon the Rock.</P>
<P>Having now store of Vinegar, and being a great
Lover of Pickles, which he had learnt to make by
seeing his last Wife, who being an extraordinary
Cook, and made of all sorts every Year; he calls
to Mind he had often in his Walks seen something
like Mushrooms, so makes it his Business to look
for some; thus having pick'd up a few, of which
<HI>Beaufidelle</HI> (who follow'd him up and down) having
taken Notice, immediately ranges about, and being
<PB N="250" REF="265"/>
nimbler footed than his Master, and not oblig'd to
stoop so low, pick'd double the Quantity in the
same Space of Time; so that he soon had enough
to serve him till the next Season.</P>
<P>His good Success in making that sort of Pickle,
encourages him to try another; and having taken
notice of a Plant in the Wood, that bears a small
green Flower, which before it is blown looks like
a Caper, he gathers a few, and their Taste and Fla∣vour
being no ways disagreeable, he judg'd, that
when pickl'd, they would be pleasant, so tries them,
which according to his Mind were full as good as
the real Ones: He gathers a sufficient Quantity,
with the Help of his Attendant, so stocks himself
with two as pleasant Pickles, as different sorts; but
there's another which he admires above all, none to
his Mind like the Cucumber, and the Island pro∣ducing
none, left him no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oom to hope for any;
yet (as Likeness is a vast help to Imagination) if he
could but find any thing, which ever so little resem∣bles
them in Make, Nature or Taste, it will please
his Fancy: He therefore examaines every kind of
Buds, Blossoms, and Seeds, having at last found
that of a wild Parsnip, which being long and nar∣row,
almost the Bigness and Make of a Pickling
Cucumber, green and crisp withal, full of a small
flat Seed, not unlike that of the Thing he would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain have it to be, he pickles some of them, which
being of Colour and near upon the Make, he fancies
them quite of the Taste.</P>
<P>His Beans being at that Time large enough for
the first Crop, he gathers some for his Dinner, the
Shells being tender and of a delicate green, it came
into his Mind, they might be made to imitate
<HI>French</HI> Beans; they are, said he, near the Nature,
I can make them quite of the Shape, so be they
have the same Savour; so he cuts them in long nar∣row
<PB N="251" REF="266"/>
Slips, and pickles some, the other Part he boils,
and there being none to contradict their taste, they
past current, for as good <HI>French</HI> Beans as any that
ever grew.</P>
<P>The Disappointment of having something more
comfortable than Water to drink, being retriev'd
by producing in the Room thereof, withal to make
his Eatables more delicious, he proceeds in his first
Project, and taking necessary Cares to prevent that
Accident which intercepted Success in his first un∣dertaking,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he accomplishes his Design, and makes
a Liquor no wise inferior to the best Cider; so,
that now he has both to revive and keep up his Spi∣rits,
as well as to please his Palate and sute his
Appe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite.</P>
<P>Having now nothing to crave or wish for, but
rather all Motives for Content, he lies down with a
peaceable Mind, no Care or Fear disturbing his
Thoughts, his Sleep is not interrupted with fright∣ful
Fancies, but rather diverted with pleasant and
diverting Dreams, he is not startled at Thunder or
Storms, tho' never so terrible, his Trust being on
Providence, who at sundry Times, and in various
manners has rescu'd him from Death, tho' appa∣rently
unavoidable, being for above thirty Years mi∣raculously
protected and maintain'd in a Place so
remote <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om all human Help and Assistance.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding his Firmness and whole
Trust on Providence, he is oblig'd to give way to
the Weakness of his Nature; a strange and shocking
Noise is heard at a Distance in the Air, which hav∣ing
reach'd the Place where he stood, covers it
with Darkness for several Minutes, at which he is
so alarm'd, that he thinks himself past all Hopes,
till the Noise being ceas'd, and that which intercep∣ted
the Light dispers'd, his scar'd Senses returning
to their proper Seat, and his stray'd Reason repeal'd,
<PB N="252" REF="267"/>
he is asham'd of the Weakness of his Faith, and
begs Pardon for his late Mistrust of the Continua∣tion
of Providence's Protection, who had all along
given him all imaginable reason to depend on it at
all Times; thus having open'd his Door, he steps
out to see if he could discover the Cause of the late
most surprizing and sudden Darkness, in a bright
Sun-shining Day, which having found out by the
vast Number of dead Birds of several Kinds, laying
up and down the Ground, he was seiz'd with no
small Amazement, tho' with less Fear.</P>
<P>From that most surprizing Aspect, he infers there
had been a Battle of those Creatures in the Air, the
great Number of which had occasion'd the late de∣crease.</P>
<P>Having made Reflections upon that astonishing
Transaction, he can draw from thence no other
Inference, but a Prognostication of dreadful Wars
in <HI>Europe,</HI> from which he begs Heavens to protect
his native Country: And least the dead Birds that
lay in great Numbers should (with laying) infect
the Island, he and his Monkey carried them to the
other Side of the Rock, so threw them into the Sea,
only as many of them as had soft Feathers on their
Breasts and Bellies he pluck'd away to stuff a Pil∣low
for the Beast, being a little too hot at Nights
for it to lie upon the Bed; so having clear'd the
Place, and being tir'd with often going up and
down the rugged Rock, he stay'd at Home the Re∣mainder
of the Day, and at Night goes to Bed;
but as the late Omen of approaching Evil had pre∣occupated
his Thoughts in the Day, with Cares
concerning his Country, his Mind run upon't in the
Night; so dreams he sees Wives weeping and melt∣ing
in Tears, taking their Leaves of their indulging
Husbands, hanging destitute of Strength about their
Necks, whose Grief did weigh them to the Ground:
<PB N="253" REF="268"/>
Turning from that afflicting Object, he sees another
as shocking; the old Father bath'd in Tears em∣bracing
his only Son, bidding him farewel, and
with him to all the Comforts of this Life, and sup∣port
of his Age; moving his Eyes from that, they
light on full as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bad a Sight, the tender Mother
swoning in her dear Child's Arms, whom an inex∣orable
Press-Gang ïs hawling away. Thus every
Face expressing Grief for a Relation or a Friend;
not being able to see those terrifying Objects (which
the Town did abound in) he betakes himself to the
Country, that by keeping from the Afflicted, he
may avoid Grief.</P>
<P>Having quit the Town, he finds himself on a
sudden, in a Place as full of Terrors, where he saw
Gores of Blood here and there, lose Horses kicking
and prancing about, some draging their late Rider
by the Stirrop, others wounded and their Guts
hanging out, at a Distance crouds of Men in Flame
and Smoak, confusedly moving like Heaps of Dust
in a Whirl-wind, leaving behind them as they
mov'd vast Numbers of Men and Horses, both dead
and dying; some without Legs, others without
Arms, and abundance with but one of each.</P>
<P>At a Distance from thence, some in pursuit of
their Enemies, hacking and cutting them down all
the Way before them, like Wood for Fewel, others
flying from being Slain, cast themselves into rapid
Rivers, where they perish by thousands.</P>
<P>As he was looking at those terrible Objects, he
finds himself of a sudden surrounded by rustical
Soldiers, holding their Swords and Bayonets to his
Breast, asking him in a surly Manner, whether
<HI>High</HI> or <HI>Low;</HI> at which being very much startled,
not knowing what to Answer, being a Stranger to
their meaning, he told them he was an <HI>Englishman,</HI>
which they appearing to be also, made him hope
<PB N="254" REF="269"/>
for better Usage; but they seizing him in a violent
Manner, saying he might he <HI>Engligh,</HI> and yet an
Enemy to the Country, then he awak'd in a won∣derful
Fright; but being come to himself he con∣cludes,
that his Dream did proceed from his late
Surprize, at the preceeding Day's astonishing Trans∣actions;
so having again recommended his Country
to Heavens Protection, he goes about making the
Bed for his Monkey, as he had concluded on be∣fore,
and with some Sail-Cloth makes a Case, so
stuffed it with the Feathers he had saved for that
Purpose.</P>
<P>The Night being come, he lays the Couching
which he made for the Beast, by his own Bed, who
very readily went to it, being very soft and easy.</P>
<P>And as Cares for his Country had in the Day
occupay'd his Thoughts, his Mind in the Night is
impress'd with the Subject, tho' not with so dismal
an Idea as the Preceeding, having since been divert∣ed
with such Objects as remov'd the terrifying As∣pects,
as before offer'd themselves to his Imagination,
which now is taken up with being in St. <HI>James</HI>'s-Park,
where he had formerly taken Pleasure, and
which he fancies had since lost many of its former
Agreements.</P>
<P>As he was walking, a Report was rais'd, that a
certain great Person (who by his late great Services
to the Nation, lhaed gain'd a Title to the Palace) was
just deceas'd, having before his Death intail'd the
same upon a Foreign Prince of great Renown; this
surprizing Piece of News occaxion'd a sudden Alter∣ation
in every Body's Countenance, some look'd
pale with Grief, others red with Wrath, but every
Thing in Nature seem'd to express a Feeling for
the Loss, the Trees shed half their Virtues, and the
Grass wither'd.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="270"/>
This dull Scene having lasted some small Time,
the Trees and Grass recover their former Verdure
brighter than before; the lofty Oaks, which he
fancied bordered the Mall, bore fine Roses in vast
Number.</P>
<P>This additional Beauty in those noble Plants
so already fam'd Abroad for their Toughness and
Strength, prompts People of all Nations, to come
and refresh themselves under their lofty and fra∣grant
Shades.</P>
<P>Having with great Satisfaction admired the sur∣prizing
improvment of the Oaks, which to his
Imagination did prognosticate Prosperity to the
Nation; then he walks on Northwards where see∣ing
abundance of Thistles, which made him wonder
they were permitted to grow in a Place where
every thing ought to contribute to its Agreements
and Pleasantness; but having considered the Stout∣ness
of the Plant, which denoted their being well
rooted, the judg'd it impossible to clear the Ground,
Besides, the Bees loving to settle on them, probably
sucking more Honey from their Blossoms, than
any more agreeable or sweeter scented Flower, for
that Reason he imagin'd might be the Occasion
they were not gather'd.</P>
<P>Walking back again, he meets with several No∣blemen,
some with a blew Cordoon, others with
green; each with a Gardening Tool in their Hand,
going to turn up and till the Ground, between that
where the Thistles did grow, and that where the
Oaks stood. He was startled to see those great
Persons, who hardly will concern themselves with
their own Lands and Possessions, labour to improve
that wherein every private Person had a Share; he
stood some Time admiring their Dexterity, and
Readiness at their Work; then walks on to the
Mall, which he found throng'd with a Quantity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="256" REF="271"/>
all Nations, every one having a Rose in their
Hand, wherewith they diverted themselves as they
walked.</P>
<P>Having gaz'd about him a considerable Time, he
had a Fancy to go and see how the noble Gard∣ners
went on with their Work; where being come,
he finds, to his great Admiration, the Ground had
been so wonderfully well manur'd, that the Oaks
and Thistles had struck their Roots through it, and
did meet; so growing together, had produc'd a
Plant which bore both Roses and Thistles, to every
Body's Wonder, which ever since made the Thistles
so valu'd, that but few great or fine Gardens, that
have not more or less of them.</P>
<P>His Monkey being startled out of his Sleep, in a
mighty Fright, running behind his Back squecking,
awak'd him in the Midst of his Amazement; thus
being exceedingly pleas'd with his late Dream, of
which he conceiv'd a mighty good Omen to Old-<HI>England,</HI>
differing so very much from the preceed∣ings,
both in Nature and Signification.</P>
<P>Thus, tho' earlier than he usually did rise, he gets
up to set it down, whilst fresh in his Mind, and
also the Year, being 1707; then goes to take a
Walk before Breakfast, and the Beast with him,
who, being not yet recovered of its late Fright, keeps
closs to his Master, every now and then looking be∣hind,
as tho' still fearing, at which <HI>Quarll</HI> concludes
the Creature must needs have been disturbed in its
Sleep the Night before, with some frightful Dream,
which made him wonder that an Animal void of
Reason, and uncapable of Reflections, should be
susceptible to Imagination.</P>
<P>The Day being past without any Thing extraor∣dinary
happening, he made no further Remarks, but
follow'd his usual Occupati <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and then went to
his Rest, and the Monkey to his new Bed, as the
<PB N="257" REF="272"/>
Night before; which he took Care to draw as closs
to its Master as he could; then having been twice
or thrice about the Room, examining every Cor∣ner,
he lies down and sleeps quietly, till the Dawn∣ing
of the Morning, at which Time he starts up
again as the Night before.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being second Time awaked in the fame
Manner, and much about the same Hour, concludes
the Cause must proceed from the Pillow, and re∣solves
to experiment it himself the next Night, at
which Time Crowds of terrifying Aspects appears in
his Imagination, which allure his whole Faculties
and set all his Senses in an Uproar; his Eyes are
took up with frightful Objects, and his Ears fill'd
with a terrible Noise, at which the rest of his
Senses have left their Offices, and are become
useless.</P>
<P>Being awake the next Morning, he finds himself
inlcine to believe that the Pillow had really some In∣fluence
on the Imagination; but as one Night's Ex∣perience
was not a sufficient Solution to his Enquiry
in that supernatural Operation, having often dream'd
before he us'd the Pillow, and resolves to try it se∣veral
Nights successively; during which his Mon∣key
slept very quiet, and he as disturb'd: This
works a great Way towards the Perswasion of what
he had a strong Fancy to believe; yet to be better
satisfied of the Reality of it, he lays by the Pillow
for three or four Nights together, during which
Time both he and the Beast did sleep very quiet.</P>
<P>This added much to his Opinion, that evil
Effluvies issued out of those Feathers the Pillow
was stuffed with; but as he formerly dream'd and
had many Nights Intermission between those that
were entertain'd with Dreams, he will once more
try before he fully concludes that it is so: Thus
puts it again under his Head that Night, and as it
<PB N="258" REF="273"/>
was the last Experiment, it prov'd also the most
troublesome, being at the Time terrified with more
shocking Objects than that preceedings, which tho' they
represented fierce and bloody Battles to his Imagi∣nation,
yet were less terrible to him, having not
as yet discern'd his native Country engag'd therein,
whom now he finds to be the principal Party con∣cern'd,
on whom all Success depends, and which
cannot be strove for, without vast Expences, and ir∣retrievable
Loss of his dear Countrymen, for which
his Heart did bleed, as flush as for those whom he
dream'd he did see in their Gore.</P>
<P>Having with Terror and Greif fatigu'd his Eyes
with the most shocking and afflicting Effects of
War, Men and Horses lying as thick upon the
Ground as Grass in a Meadow, and Streams of
Blood running like so many Brooks, supplied by a
strong Spring; he lifts up his Eye to Heaven im∣ploring
an End to that execrable Devourer of Man∣kind.</P>
<P>And whilst his Eyes were still fix'd to the Hea∣vens,
he sees Victory rushing thro' thick Clouds of
Obstacles approaching to her, which having over∣come,
did settle over the Army his Countrymen
belong'd to, over whose Head she and flou∣rish'd
her Colours, pointing at approaching Peace,
attended with Plenty; but in a sudden there arose
an infectious Mist out of the Ground, which cramp∣ing
the <HI>Englishmen</HI>'s Hands, that they could no
more use their conquering Arms; which fatal Ac∣cident
having both encourag'd and strengthen'd the
Enemy, they fell on the unfortunate Remains of
the Army, with unmerciful Fury; who now hav∣ing
lost all their Support and Dependance, were
most cruelly cut to Pieces; at which most dismal
and afflicting Object he did awake; and tho' this
Dream was a sufficient Proof of the Feathers Influ∣ence,
<PB N="259" REF="274"/>
yet he cannot be satisfy'd but it must be omi∣nous,
having so much Relation to the preceedings;
so sets it down with them, and for a more certain
Conviction of what he had all Cause imaginable to
believe; he is resolv'd to try his Monkey once
more the Night following; but the Beast, who had
not yet forgot the Uneasiness that that Bed had
caused him, chose to lie on the Ground, which en∣tirely
convinced <HI>Quarll</HI> that there was a malignant
Quality into those Feathers; so throws them into
the Sea, and fills the Case with a Sort of soft Moss,
which grew at the Bottom of a particular Tree,
on which the Creature lay very quiet ever after.</P>
<P>And as his yearly stripping the Eagles of their
Eggs, had prevented their Encrease, it also favour'd
and advanc'd that of the Creatures in the Island,
on whose Young they did feed; so that the Num∣ber
of the wild Monkeys being considerably aug∣mented,
made their Food scant, which caus'd
them now and then to come and steal some∣what
out of <HI>Quarll</HI>'s Ground. <HI>Beanfidelle,</HI> whose
good keeping and warm lying had made to thrive
in Bigness and Strength exceeding his Kind, finding
some of them stealing his Master's Roots, did beat
them away, which oblig'd those subtile Creatures
to come several together, the better to be able
to encounter him, which <HI>Quarll</HI> having taken No∣tice
of, and being willing to add a new Sport to his
usual Diversions, cuts a Stick of the Length
and Bigness that the Creature could manage, which
he gave him, and taking his own Staff exercises it
before him, who did the same with his; and ap∣prehending
what Use it was given him for, he had
it often in his Hands, and with it drove away
the others when they came, tho' ten or a Do∣zen
together; so that the Roots were very
well guarded, by his continual Watching, which
<PB N="260" REF="275"/>
made those sly and spightful Creatures watch an
Opportunity to take him at a Disadvantage: Thus
finding him one Morning as he was going for Wa∣ter
by himself, as he was wont to do; and being
then without his Staff, of which they stood in great
Fear, a considerable Number fell upon him, and
did so bite and beat him, that he lay as dead;
but his Master appearing, who being uneasy at
his extraordinary Stay, was gone to see what was
the Occasion thereof, did put them to the Flight;
and so less the poor Creature with just Breath e∣nough
to keep the Life of it in, and scarce Strength
sufficient to draw it.</P>
<P><HI>Quarll</HI> being come to the Place where his beloved
<HI>Beaufidelle</HI> lay in a most dismal bloody Condition,
he could not forbear shedding Tears to see him
thus miserably dying; but finding still Breath in
him, gave him Hopes of his Recovery: And
takin him up in his Arms, with all the Care he
could, he hastens Home, and gives him a little of
the Liquor he had made, which by that Time, had
got both Body and Spirit; then having laid him
upon its Bed, and cover'd him with his Winter-Wrapper,
he makes a Fire and warms some of the
said Liquor, and fresh Butter, wherewith he washes
its Sores; so lays him down again, giving him all
the careful Attendance he could during its Illness,
which held but one Week, at the End of which if
died, to his unspeakable Grief, who from that
Time did grow so melancholly, that he had not
the Courage to go on with his Memorial, till
having a most remarkable Dream about twelve
Months after, he chang'd his Resolution, so pro∣ceeded
in his Memoirs; and as he did set down
his Dream, he also did the Death of his beloved
Beast, happening near the same Time.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="276"/>
Having spent the Year but dully, for Want of his
diverting Company at Home, whom to put as
much out of his Mind as he could, he walk'd the
spare Hours he had left from his usual Occupation;
thus being one Day something fatigu'd, having lost
that wonted Alacrity his wonted Chearfulness did
create, he sat down under the next Cluster of Trees
he came at, and being in a dull Disposition,
he was soon lull'd asleep, at a lonesome Note of a cer∣tain
Sort of melancholly Bird, who shuns others
Company (tho' of its own Kind) at all Times but in
Breeding Time; which having plac'd it self in the
thickest and shaddiest Part of the Grove, where <HI>Quarll</HI>
had made Choice to lie, he falls a singing his melan∣cholly
Notes, which being suitable to his Disposition
of both Body and Mind, soon lull'd him asleep, du∣ring
which he dream'd that he saw an old Man sit∣ting
in a large Circle, around which all the Signs of
the Zodiack were, and the old Gentleman appear'd
extreme busie stringing of small Beeds, some white
and some black; and when he had strung a certain
Number, he began another String, and so on. He had
the Curiosity to tell how many he put in a String;
so keeps an Account of the next he did begin, and
tells just 60; having made as many of those Strings
as there were Beeds in each, he puts them together,
and begins again to string, mixing white and black as
they came to his Hand, twisting every sixty String in
Parcels, till he had made sixty of them, which he
neately plates together, so proceeded as from the Be∣ginning,
and makes 24 of those Plates, which he
weaves together, making a flat Piece of Beed-work,
changeable upon black, which, when look'd upon one
Way seem'd pleasant, and being seen from another
as disagreeable. He work'd on till he had made three
hundred and sixty four such Pieces, then lays them
<PB N="262" REF="277"/>
up in a Bundle; so goes to Work again, beginning
to string as at the first.</P>
<P>Having look'd himself weary with seeing still the
same, of which he could make nothing, he goes away
leaving the old Gentleman stringing his Beeds; who
seeing him go, lays by his Work and follows him,
and having overtaken him, ask'd him what he had
been looking at all that Time; he being surpriz'd
at the surly Question, he modestly replies, He had
been admiring his Work, in which doing he hop'd
there was no Offence; No, said the old Man, pro∣viding
thou learnest something by what thou hast
seen; to which he answer'd, It was impossible for
him to learn such a mysterious Business, with once
seeing it done; so much less, being entirely a
Stranger to it. A Stranger to it art thou? reply'd
the old Man, in a surly Manner, and hast wasted so
much of my Work; I am TIME, whom thou hast
often ill-us'd, and those white and black Beeds, that
thou hast seen me string, are good and bad Mo∣ments,
I crowd into Minutes, which I link into
Hours; thus weave Days, wherewith Years are
compos'd. Thou hast seen me compleat the pre∣sent,
which is reckoned the Year 1713. I tell thee
before the ensuing is ended, I will grace the <HI>British</HI>
Throne with an illustrious Race, to the End of
Kings Reigns; so vanish'd. Then he awak'd in a
great Surprise, and goes Home pondering on
his Dream, of which he inserr'd that if there
be any Signification in the roving Conceptions
of the Mind, this must prognosticate the sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣dy
Ascention of some great Monarch upon the
<HI>English</HI> Throne; so sets in his Memorial that most
remarkable Dream, which happen'd in 1713. hearti∣ly
wishing the Accomplishment thereof, for the
Quiet and Prosperity of his dear Country.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="278"/>
There happen'd nothing after for the Space of
four Years, but great Thunders and Lightnings in
the Summer, and Abundance of Hail and Snow in
the Winter, with now and then Storms which did
leave several Sorts of Fishes in the Clifts and
Holes of the Rocks, and sometimes Fragments of
staven Ships, and batter'd Casks, or broken Chests,
with a Plank and such like Products of Ship∣wreck,
not worth recording; so, for Want of
Employment, he has several idle and sullen Hours
in the Day-Time, which his late beloved Animal's
diverting Company made to slip away with Pleasure;
and for Want of which they now creep slowly on,
being loaded with dull and heavy Thoughts, which
made those Walks irksome, he at that Time took
for Ease; that by the Diversity of Objects Abroad,
his Mind might be withdrawn from his anxious
Solitude.</P>
<P>Having one Day perus'd his Memorial, as he
commonly did once a Year, the Dream he had in
1713, wherein TIME did predict such great Happi∣ness
to his Country the Year ensuing, made such an
Impression in his Mind, that he always thought of
it; so being walking, and the Day proving extraor∣dinary
hot, he goes to shelter himself in one of his
natural Groves, where having lain himself down on
the Grass, he was soon lull'd a Sleep; during which,
the Idea he had conceiv'd of his former Dream, re∣presented
to his Imagination a most Majestick and
Graceful Monarch, fitting on a magnificent Throne,
round which did stand many delightful Olive-plants,
which much added to his Lustre.</P>
<P>Having, with a great deal of Pleasure, gaz'd at
the most graceful Countenance of the King, which
denoted Justice, Equity, Love, and Clemency; he
gave Heaven thanks for the mighty Blessing bestow'd
on his Country, so comes away, in order to return
<PB N="264" REF="279"/>
to his Island, with the additional Happiness to the
many he already enjoy'd.</P>
<P>Being come from Court, on his Journey he meets
the same old Gentleman, of whom he dream'd the
Year before, who taking him by the Hand, said, I
find thou hast been to see, the Accomplishment of
my Prediction, now I'll tell the more,
<Q><L>E'er one Thousand seven Hundred and forty is written,</L>
<L>All Divisions will cease in <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></L></Q>
next I show thee what I have done, to secure the
Arrival of my Prophesy; so takes him upon a high
Place, from whence he could see in the Cabinet of
all the Prince's in <HI>Europe,</HI> in several of which he took
notice lay a vast Heap of rich and costly Things,
but confus'd, shapeless, and fit for no Use; now,
said the old Man to him, these are Disappointments
and defeated Projects, made to intercept what I did
determine, so vanishes; at which he awak'd ex∣ceeding
glad to find himself safe in his blessed Island,
and wonderfully pleas'd with his Dream, which be∣token'd
so much good to his dear Country: This
was the Conclusion of his Records in 1724.</P>
