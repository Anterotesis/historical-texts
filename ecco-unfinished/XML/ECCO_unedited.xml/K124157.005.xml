<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Pleasant Adventure.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA was again called upon for her note,
before she had read the letter it was to answer;
but relieved now from the pressure of her own
terrifying apprehensions, she gave it complete and
willing attention.</P>
<P>It contained four sides of paper, closely yet ele∣gantly
written in the language of romantic senti∣ment.
Mrs. Berlinton said she had spent, as yet,
only a few minutes with her aunt; but they had
been awfully important; and since she had exacted
from her a promise to stay the whole day, she
could not deny her disappointed friendship the
transient solace of a paper conversation, to sooth
the lingering interval of this unexpected absence.
“My soul pines to unburden the weight of its
sorrows into thy sympathising bosom, my gentlest
friend; but oh! there let them not sojourn! receive
but to lighten, listen but to commiserate, and then,
far, far thence dismiss them, retaining but the re∣membrance
thou hast dismissed them with conso∣lation.”
She then bewailed the time lost to soft
communication and confidence, in their journey,
from the presence of others; for though one was a
brother she so truly loved, she found, notwith∣standing
the tenderness of his nature, he had the
prejudices of a man upon man's prerogatives, and
her woes called for soothing, not arguments; and
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
the other, she briefly added, was but an accidental
passenger. “'Tis to thee only, O my beauteous
friend! I would trust the sad murmurs of my irre∣versible
and miserable destiny, of which I have
learnt but this moment the cruel and desperate
secret cause.” She reserved, however, the discovery
for their meeting, and called upon her pity for
her unfortunate brother, as deeply involved in his
future views, as she in her past, by this mystery:
“And have I written this much,” she bursts forth,
“without speaking of the cherished correspondent
whom so often I have described to thee? Ah! be∣lieve
me not faithless to that partner of my chosen
esteem, that noble, that resistless possessor of my
purest friendship! No, charming Camilla, think
not so degradingly of her whom fate, in its sole
pitying interval, has cast into thy arms.” Two
pages then ensued with his exclusive encomium,
painting him chief in every virtue, and master of
every grace. She next expressed her earnestness to
see Indiana, who Camilla had told her would be
at Southampton. “Present me, I conjure thee, to
the fair and amiable enslaver of my unhappy bro∣ther!
I die to see, to converse with her, to catch
from her lovely lips the modest wisdom with which
he tells me they teem; to read in her speaking eyes
the intelligence which he assures me illumines
them.” She concluded with desiring her to give
what orders she pleased for the coach, and the ser∣vants,
and to pass the day with her friends.</P>
<P>Camilla, whose own sensations were now revived
to happiness, read the letter with all the sympathy
it claimed, and felt her eyes fill with generous tears
at the contrast of their situations; yet she highly
blamed the tenderness expressed for the unknown
correspondent, though its innocence she was sure
must vanquish even Edgar, since its so constant
avowal proved it might be published to all man∣kind.
She answered her in language nearly as af∣fectionate,
though less inflated than her own, and
resolved to support her with Edgar, till her sweet∣ness
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
and purity should need no champions but
themselves. She was ashamed of the species of ex∣pectation
raised for Indiana, yet knew not how to
interfere with Melmond's idea of her capacity,
lest it might seem unkind to represent its fallaci∣ousness;
but she was glad to find her soft friend
seemed to have a strict guardian in her brother;
and wished eagerly to communicate to Edgar a
circumstance which she was sure would be so
welcome to him.</P>
<P>Impatient to see Eugenia, she accepted the offer
of the carriage, and desirous to escape Mrs. Mittin,
begged to have it immediately; but that notable
person came to the door at the same time as the
coach, and, without the smallest ceremony, said she
would accompany her to the hotel, in order to
take the opportunity of making acquaintance with
her friends.</P>
<P>Courage frequently, at least in females, becomes
potent as an agent, where it has been feeble as a
principal. Camilla, though she had wished, upon
her own account, to repress Mrs. Mittin in the
morning, had been too timid for such an under∣taking;
but now, in her anxiety to oblige Edgar,
she gathered resolution for declining her company.
She then found, as is generally the case with the
fearful, the task less difficult than she had expected;
for Mrs. Mittin, content with a promise self-made,
that the introduction should take place the next
day, said she would go and help Mrs. Berlinton's
woman to unpack her lady's things, which would
make a useful friend for her in the house, for a
thousand odd matters.</P>
<P>The carriage of Sir Hugh was just driving off
as Camilla arrived at the hotel.</P>
<P>She hurried from Mrs. Berlinton's coach, de∣manding
which way the company was gone; and
being answered, by a passing waiter, up stairs, ran
on at once, without patience or thought of asking
if she should turn to the right or left; till seeing a
gentleman standing still upon the landing place,
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
and leaning upon the bannisters, she was retreating,
to desire a conductor, when she perceived it was
Dr. Orkborne; who, while the ladies were looking
at accomodations, and inquiring about lodgings,
in profound cogitation, and with his tablets in his
hands, undisturbed by the various noises around
him, and unmoved by the various spectators con∣tinually
passing and repassing, was finishing a period
which he had begun in the coach for his great
work.</P>
<P>Camilla, cheerfully greeting him, begged to
know which way she should find Eugema; but,
making her a sign not to speak to him, he wrote
on. Accustomed to his manner, and brought up
to respect whatever belonged to study, from the
studious life and turn of her father, she obeyed the
mute injunction, and waited quietly by his side; till,
tired of the delay, though unwilling to interrupt him,
she glided softly about the passage, watching and ex∣amining
if she could see any of the party, yet fearing
to offend or mortify him if she called for a waiter.</P>
<P>While straying about thus, as far off as she could
go without losing sight of Dr. Orkborne, a door
she had just passed was flung open, and she saw
young Halder, whose licentious insolence had so
much alarmed her in the bathing-house, stroam
out, yawning, stretching, and swearing unmean∣ingly,
but most disgustingly, at every step.</P>
<P>Terrified at his sight, she went on, as she could
not get to the Doctor without passing him; but the
youth, recollecting her immediately, called out:
“Ah, ha! are you there again, you little vixen?”
and pursued her.</P>
<P>“Dr. Orkborne! Dr. Orkborne!” she rather
screamed than said, “pray come this way! I con∣jure—I
beseech—I entreat—Dr. Orkborne!—”</P>
<P>The Doctor, catching nothing of this but his
name, querulously exclaimed: “You molest me
much!” but without raising his eyes from his tab∣lets;
while Halder, at the appeal, cried: “Ay, ay,
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
Doctor! keep your distance, Doctor! you are best
where you are, Doctor, I can tell you, Doctor!</P>
<P>Camilla, then, too much scared to be aware she
ran a far greater risk than she escaped, desperately
sought refuge by opening the nearest door: though
by the sudden noises upon the stairs, and in all the
adjoining passages, it seemed as if Dr. Orkborne
were the only one not alarmed by her cries.</P>
<P>No one, however, could approach so soon as
the person of whose chamber she had burst the
door; who was an old gentleman, of a good and
lively countenance, who promptly presenting him∣self,
looked at her with some surprise, but good-humouredly
asked her what she was pleased to
want in his room.</P>
<P>“That gentleman,” she cried, panting and
meaning to point to Dr. Orkborne; “that gentle∣man
I want, sir!” but such a medley of waiters,
company, and servants, had in a moment assembled
in the space between them, that the Doctor was
no longer to be discerned.</P>
<P>“Do you only open my door, then,” said he,
drily, “to tell me you want somebody else?”</P>
<P>Yet when Halder, vowing he owed her an ill
turn for which she should pay, would have seized
her by the hand, he protected with his own arm,
saying: “Fie, boy, fie! let the girl alone! I don't
like violence.”</P>
<P>A gentleman now, forcing himself through the
crowd, exclaimed: “Miss Camilla Tyrold! is it
possible! what can you do here, madam?”</P>
<P>It was Dr. Marchmont, whom the affrighted
Camilla, springing forward, could only answer in
catching by the arm.</P>
<P>“Tyrold” repeated the old gentleman; “Is her
name Tyrold?”</P>
<P>Sorry now to have pronounced it in this mixt
company, Dr. Marchmont evaded any answer;
and, begging her to be composed, asked whither,
or to whom, he might have the honour of con∣ducting
her.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7"/>
“Almost all my family are here,” cried she,
“but I could not make Dr. Orkborne shew me
the way to them.”</P>
<P>The old gentleman then, repeating “Tyrold!
why if her name is Tyrold, I'll take care of her
myself;” invited her into his apartment.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont, thanking him, said: This
young lady has friends, who in all probability are
now uneasily seeking her; we must lose no time in
joining them.”</P>
<P>“Well, but, well,” cried the old stranger, “let
her come into my room till the coast is clear, and
then take her away in peace. Come, there's a good
girl, come in, do! you're heartily welcome; for
there's a person of your name that's the best friend
I ever had in the world. He's gone from our parts,
now; but he's left nothing so good behind. Pray,
my dear, did you ever hear of a gentleman, an old
Yorkshire Baronet, of your name?</P>
<P>“What! my uncle?”</P>
<P>“Your uncle! why are you niece to Sir Hugh
Tyrold?”</P>
<P>Upon her answering yes, he clapped his hands
with delight, and saying: “Why then I'll take
care of you myself, if it's at the risk of my life!”
carried, rather than drew her into his room, the
Doctor following. Then, loudly shutting his door
in the face of Halder, he called out: “Enter my
castle who dare! I shall turn a young man myself,
at the age of seventy, to drub the first varlet that
would attack the niece of my dear old friend!”</P>
<P>They soon heard the passage clear, and, without
deigning to listen to the petulant revilings with
which young Halder solaced his foolish rage,
“Why, my dear,” he continued, why did not you
tell me your name was Tyrold at once? I promise
you, you need carry nothing else with you into our
parts, to see all the doors fly open to you. You
make much of him, I hope where he is? for he left
not a dry eye for twenty miles round when he quit∣ted
us. I don't know how many such men you may
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
have in Hampshire; but Yorkshire's a large county,
yet the best man in it would find it hard to get a
seat in Parliament, where Sir Hugh Tyrold would
offer himself to be a candidate. We all say, in
Yorkshire, he's so stuffed full of goodness and kind∣ness,
that there's no room left in him for any thing
else; that's our way of talking of him in Yorkshire;
if you have a better way in Hampshire, I shall be
glad to learn it; never too late for that; I hate pride.”</P>
<P>No possible disturbance could make Camilla in∣sensible
to pleasure in the praise of her uncle, or
depress her spirits from joining in his eulogy; and
her attention, and brightening looks, drew a narra∣tive
from the old gentleman of the baronet's good
actions and former kindnesses, so pleasant both to
the speaker and the hearer, that the one forgot he
had never seen her before, and the other, the fright∣ful
adventure which had occasioned their meeting
now.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont at length, looking at his watch,
inquired what she meant to do? to seek her sister
and party, she answered; and, returning her host
the warmest acknowledgments for his assistance
and goodness, she was going; but, stopping her:
“How now? he cried, “don't you want to know
who I am? Now I have told you I am a friend of your
uncle, don't you suppose he'll ask you my name?</P>
<P>Camilla, smiling, assured him she wished much
to be informed, but knew not how to trouble him
with the question.</P>
<P>“Why my name, my dear, is Westwyn, and
when you say that to your uncle, he won't give you
a sour look for your pains; take my word for that
beforehand. I carried over his nephew and heir,
a cousin, I suppose, of yours, to Leipsic with me,
about eight years ago, along with a boy of my own,
Hal Westwyn; a very good lad, I assure you, though
I never tell him so to his face for fear of pussing
him up; I hate a boy puffed up; he commonly
comes to no good; that's the only fault of my ho∣noured
friend; he spoils all young people—witness
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
that same cousin of yours, that I can't say I much
like; no more does he me; but tell your good uncle
you have met me; and tell him I love and honour
him as I ought to do; I don't know how to do
more, or else I would; tell him this, my dear.
And I have not forgot what he did for me once,
when I was hard run; and I don't intend it; I'm
no friend to short memories.”</P>
<P>Camilla said, his name, and her uncle's regard
for him, had long been familiar to her; and told
him Clermont Lynmere was of the party to South∣ampton,
though she knew not how to enter abruptly
into an explanation of his mistake concerning the
inheritance. Mr. Westwyn answered he was in no
hurry to see Clermont, who was not at all to his
taste; but would not quit Hampshire without visiting
Cleves: and when he gathered that two more nieces
of Sir Hugh were in the house, he desired to be
presented to them.</P>
<P>Upon re-entering the passage, to the great amuse∣ment
of Dr. Marchmont, and serious provocation
of Camilla, they perceived Dr. Orkborne, standing
precisely where he had first stationed himself; attend∣ing
no more to the general hubbub than to her parti∣cular
entreaty, and as regardless of the various jolts
he had received during the tumult, as of the obstruc∣tion
he caused, by his inconvenient position, to the
haste of the passers by. Still steadily reposing against
the bannisters, he worked hard at refining his para∣graph,
persuaded, since not summoned by Miss
Margland, he had bestowed upon it but a few
minutes, though he had been fixed to that spot near
an hour.</P>
<P>Miss Margland received Camilla with a civility
which, since her positive and public affiance to
Edgar, she thought necessary to the mistress of
Beech Park; but she looked upon Dr. Marchmont,
whom she concluded to have been her advocate, with
a cold ill-will, which, for Mr. Westwyn, she seasoned
still more strongly by a portion of contemptuous
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
haughtiness; from a ready disposition to believe
every stranger, not formally announced, beneath her
notice.</P>
<P>The Doctor soon retired, and found Edgar in his
apartment, just returned from a long stroll. He re∣counted
to him the late transaction, with reiterated
exhortations to circumspection, from added doubts
of the solidity, though with new praise of the
attractions of Camilla. “She seems a character,”
he said, “difficult to resist, and yet more difficult to
attach. Nothing serious appears to impress her for
two minutes together. Let us see if the thought∣lessness
and inadvertence thus perpetually fertile of
danger, result from youthful inexperience, or have
their source in innate levity. Time and reason will
rectify the first; but time, and even reason, will
but harden and embolden the latter. Prudence,
therefore, must now interfere; or passion may fly,
when the union it has formed most requires its con∣tinuance.”</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Time-keeper.</HEAD>
<P>MR. WESTWYN, charmed to meet so many
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear relations of a long-valued friend, struck
by the extraordinary beauty of Indiana, and by the
sensible answers of the child, as he called Eugenia;
as well as caught by the united loveliness of person
and of mind which he observed in Camilla, could
not bring himself to retire till the dinner was upon
the table: pleading, in excuse for his stay, his for∣mer
intimacy with Sir Hugh. Miss Margland,
seeing in him nothing that marked fashion, strove to
distance him by a high demeanour: but though not
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
wanting in shrewdness, Mr. Westwyn was a perfectly
natural man, and only thinking her manners disagree∣able,
without suspecting her intention, took but
little notice of her, from the time he saw she could
give him no pleasure: while with the young party,
he was so much delighted, that he seriously regretted
he had only one son to offer amongst them.</P>
<P>When the dinner was served, Eugenia grew uneasy
that Dr. Orkborne should be summoned, whose non∣appearance
she had not ventured to mention, from
the professed hatred of his very sight avowed by Miss
Margland. But Camilla, brought up to exert con∣stantly
her courage for the absent, told the waiter to
call the gentleman from the head of the stairs.”</P>
<P>“My master himself, ma'am,” he answered “as
well as I, both told the gentleman the company he
came with were served; but he as good as bid us
both hold our tongues. He seems to have taken a
great liking to that place upon the stairs; though
there's nothing I know of particular in it.”</P>
<P>“But, if you tell him we wait dinner—” cried
Eugenia; when Miss Margland, interrupting her
said, “I'm sure then, you won't tell him true: for
I beg we may all begin. I think it would be rather
more decorous he should wait for us!”</P>
<P>The waiter, nevertheless, went; but presently
returned, somewhat ruffled; saying, “The gentle∣man
does not choose to hear me, ma'am. He says,
if he mayn't be let alone one single minute, it will be
throwing away all his morning. I can't say I know
what he means; but he speaks rather froppish. I'd
as lieve not go to him again, if you please.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland declared, she wished him no better
dinner than his pot-hooks; but did not doubt he
would come just before they had done, as usual;
and he was no more mentioned: though she never
in her life eat so fast; and the table was ordered to
be cleared of its covers, with a speed exactly the re∣verse
of the patience with which the Doctor was in∣dulged
on similar occasions by the baronet.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
Miss Margland, when the cloth was removed,
proposed a sally in search of lodgings. Camilla and
Eugenia, desirous of a private conference, begged to
remain within; though the latter sought to take
care of her absent preceptor, before she could enjoy
the conversation of her sister; and when Miss Marg∣land
and Indiana, in secret exultation at his dinner∣less
state, had glided, with silent simpering, past him,
flew to beseech his consent to take some nourishment.</P>
<P>Such, however, was his present absorption in
what he was writing, that the voluntary kindness of
his pupil was as unwelcome as the forced intrusion of
the waiter; and he conjured her to grant him a little
respite from such eternal tormenting, with the plain∣tive
impatience of deprecating some injury.</P>
<P>The sisters, now, equally eager to relate and to
listen to their mutual affairs, shut themselves up in
the apartment of Eugenia; who, with the greatest
simplicity, began the discourse, by saying, “Have
you heard, my dear sister, that Clermont has refused
me?”</P>
<P>Camilla was severely shocked. Accustomed her∣self
to the face and form of Eugenia, which, to
her innocent affection, presented always the image of
her virtuous mind and cultivated understanding, she
had not presaged even the possibility of such an
event; and, though she had seen with concern the
inequality of their outward appearance, Clermont
had seemed to her, in all else, so inferior to her
sister, that she had repined at his unworthiness, but
never doubted the alliance.</P>
<P>She was distressed how to offer any consolation;
but soon found none was required. Eugenia was
composed and contented, though pensive, and not
without some feeling of mortification. Yet anger
and resentment had found no place in the transaction.
Her equity acknowledged that Clermont had every
right of choice: but while her candour induced her
to even applaud his disinterestedness in relinquishing
the Cleves estate, her capacity pointed out how ter∣rible
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
must be the personal defects, that so speedily,
without one word of conversation, one trial of any
sort how their tastes, tempers, or characters might
accord, stimulated him to so decisive a rejection.
This view of her unfortunate appearance cast her, at
first, into a train of melancholy ideas, that would
fast have led her to unhappiness, though wholly un∣mixed
with any regret of Clermont, had not the
natural philosophy of her mind come to her aid; or
had her education been of a more worldly sort.</P>
<P>When Camilla related her own history, her plan
of making Edgar again completely master of his
own proceedings met the entire approbation of Eu∣genia,
who, with a serious smile, said, “Take
warning by me, my dear sister! and, little as you
have reason to be brought into any comparison with
such a one as me, anticipate the disgrace of de∣fection!”</P>
<P>Camilla, much touched, embraced her, sincerely
wishing she were half as saultless as her excellent self.</P>
<P>The return of Miss Margland and Indiana obliged
them to quit their retreat: and they now found
Dr. Orkborne in the dining-room Having finished
his paragraph, he had sought his party of his own
accord; but, meeting with no one, had taken a
book from his pocket, with which he meant to be∣guile
the appetite he felt rising, till the hour of
dinner, which he had not the smallest suspicion was
over: for of the progress of time he had no know∣ledge
but by its palpable passage from the sun to the
moon; his watch was never wound up, and the
morning and the evening were but announced to him
by a summons to breakfast and to supper.</P>
<P>The ladies seated themselves at the window.
Indiana was enchanted by the concourse, of gay
and well dressed people passing by, and far from in∣sensible
to the visible surprise and pleasure she excited
in those who cast up their eyes at the hotel.
Eugenia, to whom a great and populous town was
entirely new, found also, in the diversity as well as
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
novelty of its objects, much matter for remark and
contemplation; Miss Margland had experienced the
utmost satisfaction in seeing, at last, some faces and
some things less rustic than had been presented to her
in Yorkshire or at Cleves; and Camilla had every
hope that this place, in Edgar's own expression,
would terminate every perplexity, and give local date
to her life's permanent felicity.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, a youth appeared on the oppo∣site
pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement, whose air was new to none of the
party, yet not immediately recollected by any. It
was striking, however, in elegance and in melan∣choly.
Eugenia recollected him first, and starting
back, gasped for breath; Indiana the next moment
called out, “Ah!—it's Mr Melmond!” and
blus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing high, her whole face was bright and dim∣pled
with unexpected delight.</P>
<P>He walked on, without looking up, and Indiana,
simply piqued as well as chagrined, said she was glad
he was gone.</P>
<P>But Eugenia looked after him with a gentle sigh,
which now first she thought blameless, and a pleasure,
which, though half mournful, she now suffered her∣self
to encourage. Free from all ties that made her
shun this partiality as culpable, she secretly told her∣self
she might now, without injury to any one, in∣dulge
it for an object whom, little as he was known to
her, she internally painted with all the saultless qua∣lities
of ideal excellence.</P>
<P>From these meditations she was roused by Dr.
Orkborne's looking rather wishfully round him, and
exclaiming, “Pray—don't we dine rather late?”</P>
<P>The mistake being cleared up, by Miss Marg∣land's
assuring him it was impossible to keep dinner
waiting all day, for people who chose to stand whole
hours upon a staircase, he felt rather discomforted:
but when Eugenia privately ordered him a repast in
his own chamber, he was amply consoled, by the
unconstrained freedom with which he was empowered
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
to have more books upon the table than plates; and
to make more ink spots than he eat mouthfuls.</P>
<P>Camilla had the mortification to find, upon her
returh home, that Edgar had made his promised
visit, not only in her absence, but while Mrs. Ber∣linton
was still with her aunt.</P>
<P>That lady then communicated to Camilla the se∣cret
to which, while yet in ignorance of its existence,
she now found she had been sacrificed. Mrs. Ecton,
two years ago, had given her hand, in the most so∣lemn
privacy, to her butler, who now attended her
to Southampton. To avoid disobliging a sick old
relation, from whom she expected a considerable le∣gacy,
she had prevailed with her husband to consent
that the marriage should not be divulged: but cer∣tain
that whatever now might be her fortune, she
had no power to bequeath it from her new con∣nexion,
the terror of leaving utterly destitute a
beautiful young creature, who believed herself well
provided for, had induced her to nearly force her
acceptance of an almost superannuated old man of
family; who, merely coveting her beauty, inquired
not into her inclination. The same latent cause had
made her inexorable to the pleadings of young
Melmond; who, conceiving his fortune dependent
upon the pleasure of his aunt, his certain income
being trifling, thought it his duty to fly the fair
object of his adoration, when he discovered the de∣ceit
of Lionel with regard to the inheritance of Sir
Hugh. This sick old relation was now just dead,
and had left to her sole disposal a considerable estate.
The husband naturally refused to be kept any longer
from his just rights; but the shame she felt of mak∣ing
the discovery of a marriage contracted clandes∣tinely,
after she was sixty years of age, with a man
under thirty, threw her into a nervous fever. And,
in this state, unable to reveal to her nephew an event
which now affected him alone, she prevailed with Mr.
Ulst, who was willing to revisit his original home,
Southampton, to accompany her thither in his usual
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
capacity, till she had summoned her nephew and
niece, and acquainted them with the affair.</P>
<P>To herself, Mrs. Berlinton said, the evil of this
transaction has been over, while yet it was unknown;
she had heard it, therefore, in silence, and forborne
unavailing reproach. But her brother, to whom
the blow was new, and the consequences were still
impending, was struck with extreme anguish, that
while thus every possible hope was extinguished with
regard to his love, he must suddenly apply himself
to some business, or be reduced to the most obscure
poverty.</P>
<P>Camilla heard the account with sincere concern for
them both, much heightened for young Melmond,
upon finding that, by his express desire, his sister
now relinquished her design of cultivating an acquain∣tance
with Indiana, whom he had the virtue to de∣termine
to avoid, since his fortune, and even his
hopes, were thus irretrievably ruined.</P>
<P>They conversed together to a late hour; and Ca∣milla,
before they parted, made the most earnest apo∣logies
for the liberty taken with her house by Mrs.
Mittin: but Mrs. Berlinton, with the utmost sweet∣ness,
begged she might stay till all her business with
her was settled; smilingly adding, business alone,
she was sure could bring them together.</P>
<P>Much relieved, she then determined to press Mrs.
Mittin to collect and pay her accounts immediately;
and to avoid with her, in the meanwhile, any further
transactions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An agreeable Hearing.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY the next morning, Camilla went to
the hotel, in the carriage of Mrs. Berlinton;
eluding, though not without difficulty, the company
of Mrs. Mittin. She found the party all in good
spirits; Indiana, in particular, was completely
elated; joined to the admiration she believed awaited
her in this large and fashionable town, she now
knew she might meet there the only person who had
ever excited in her youthful, and nearly vacant
breast any appropriate pleasure, super-added to the
general zest of being adored. She did not, indeed,
think of marrying any one who could not offer her
a coach and four; but so little was she disturbed by
thinking at all, that the delight of being adulated
by the man she preferred, carried with it no idea of
danger. Eugenia too, soothed with the delusions
of her romantic but innocent fancy, flattered her∣self
she might now see continually the object she
conceived formed for meriting her even reverential
regard; and Miss Margland was importantly occu∣pied
upon affairs best suited to her taste and ancient
habits, in deliberating how first to bring forth her
fair charge with the most brilliant effect.</P>
<P>Camilla was much embarassed how to parry an
introduction to Mrs. Berlinton, upon which all the
females bulk as the foundation of their Southampton
prosperity; the young ones, already informed she
was the sister of Melmond, languishing to know her
for his sake; and Miss Margland, formerly acquainted
with the noble family of her husband, being impa∣tient
to resume her claims in similar circles; but an
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
awkard beginning apology was set aside by the
entrance of Edgar and Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>Indiana now poured forth innumerable questions
upon what she might look forward to with respect to
balls and public places; Eugenia asked nearly as
many concerning the buildings, antiquities, and
prospects; and Miss Margland more than either,
relative to the company, their genealogies and con∣nexions.
The two Doctors soon sat aloof, con∣ferring
upon less familiar matters; but Edgar only
spoke in reply, and Camilla uttered not a word.</P>
<P>Soon after, a voice on the stairs called out,
“O never mind shewing me the way; if I come to
a wrong room, I'll go on till I come to a right;”
and the next minute young Lynmere sallied into the
apartment.</P>
<P>“I could not get to you last night,” “cried he;”
“and I can only stay a moment now. I have a
pretty serious business upon my hands; so if you
can give me any breakfast, don't lose time.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland, willing to please the brother of
Indiana, readily ordered for him whatever the inn
could afford, of which he failed not heartily to par∣take,
saying, “I have met with a good comic sort
of adventure here already Guess what it is?</P>
<P>Indiana complied; but his own wish to communi∣cate
was so much stronger than that of any one to
hear, that, before she could pronounce three words,
he cried: Well, if you're so excessive curious, I'll
tell it you. I'm engaged in a duel.</P>
<P>Indiana screamed; Miss Margland echoed her
cry; Eugenia, who had looked down from his en∣trance,
raised her eyes with an air of interest; Ca∣milla
was surprised out of her own concerns; and
Edgar surveyed him with an astonishment not wholly
unmixt with contempt; but the two Doctors went
on with their own discourse.</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, Dye, don't be frightened; 'tis not
a duel in which I am to fight myself; I am only to
be second. But suppose I were first? what signifies?
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
these are things we have in hand so often, we
don't think of them.”</P>
<P>“La! brother! you don't say so?” cried Indi∣ana:
“La! how droll!” He then pretended that
he would tell nothing more.</P>
<P>Camilla inquired if he had seen Mr. Westwyn,
whom she had met with the preceding day.</P>
<P>“Not I, faith! but that's a-propos enough;
for it's his son that has asked me to be his second.”</P>
<P>“O, poor good old Mr. Westwyn!” cried Ca∣milla,
now much interested in this history; “and
can you not save him such a shock? can you not
be mediator instead of second? he seems so fond of
his son—”</P>
<P>“O, as to him, it's no matter; he's such a harsh
old huncks, I shall be glad to have him worked a
little; I've often wanted to pull him by the nose,
myself, he takes such liberties with me. But did
you ever hear of such a fool as his son? he deserves
to be badgered as bad as his father; he's going to
fight with as fine an honest fellow as ever I met
with, for nothing at all! absolutely nothing!”</P>
<P>“Dear! how droll!” said Indiana.</P>
<P>“But why can you not interfere?” cried Ca∣milla:
“poor Mr. Westwyn will be made so un∣happy
if any evil befals his son!”</P>
<P>“O, faith, as to him, he may take it as he will;
I shan't trouble my head about him; he has made
free enough with me, I can assure you; it's only to
have him out of the way, that the business is put
off till noon; it was to have been in the morning,
but the old tyrant took it into his pate to make
poor Henry, who is one of your good ones, and
does nothing to vex him on purpose, ride out with
him; he has promised, however, to get off by
twelve o'clock, when four of us are to be at a cer∣tain
spot that I shan't name.”</P>
<P>Camilla again began to plead the merits of the
father; but Indiana more urgently demanded the
reason of the combat. “I dare say, brother, they
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
fight about being in love with somebody? don't
they, brother? now do tell me?”</P>
<P>“Not a whit! it's for a girl he don't care a
straw for, and never saw but once in his life, and
don't care a farthing if he never sees again.”</P>
<P>“Dear, how droll, brother! I thought people
always fought about being in love with somebody
they wanted to marry; and never but when she
was excessive pretty.”</P>
<P>“O, faith, marriage seldom deserves a fighting
match; but as to being pretty, that's all Harry has
in his excuse, so he pretends she's as divine as an
angel.”</P>
<P>“Dear! well, and don't you know any thing
more than that about it?”</P>
<P>“No, nor he either; he only saw her at a bath∣ing
house, where a fine jolly young buck was pay∣ing
her a few compliments, that she affected not to
like; and presently, in a silly dispute whether she
was a girl of character, they had a violent quar∣rel,
and Harry was such a fool as to end it with a
challenge.”</P>
<P>At the words <HI>a bathing house,</HI> the blood forsook
the cheeks of Camilla with sudden personal alarm;
but it mounted high into them again, upon hear∣ing
the nature of the dispute; though yet again it
sunk, and lest them wholly pallid, at the brief and
final conviction she was the sole cause of this duel,
and upon so disgraceful a dispute.</P>
<P>The emotions of Edgar, though less fearful,
were not less violent nor painful. That Camilla
should be the subject of any challenge was shock∣ing,
but of such a one he thought a dishonour;
yet to prevent, and with the least publicity, its
effect, was the immediate occupation of his mind.</P>
<P>A short pause ensued, broken presently by Cler∣mont,
who, looking at his watch, suddenly jumped
up, and calling out, “Faith, I shall be too late!”
was capering out of the room; but the shame of
Camilla in the disgrace, was overpowered by her
terror of its consequences, and starting up, and
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
clasping her hands, “O cousin! O Clermont!”
she cried, “for Heaven's sake stop this affair!”</P>
<P>Clermont, satisfied that a sufficient alarm was
raised to impede the transaction, without any con∣cession
on his part, declared himself bound in ho∣nour
to attend the appointment, and, in extreme
seeming haste and earnestness, walked off: stop∣ping,
however, when he came to the door, not to
listen to the supplications of his cousin, but to toss
off a fresh cup of chocolate, which a waiter was
just carrying to the next room.</P>
<P>Camilla now, her face varying in colour twenty
times in a minute, and her whole frame shaking,
while her eyes were cast, conscious and timid, on
the floor, approached Edgar, and saying, “This
young man's father is my dear uncle's friend!—”
burst into tears.</P>
<P>Edgar, wholly dissolved, took her hand, pressed
it to his lips, besought her, in a low voice, to dis∣miss
her apprehensions, in the confidence of his
most ardent exertions, and again kissing her hand,
with the words, “Too—O, far too dear Camilla!”
hastened after Lynmere.</P>
<P>Affected in a thousand ways, she dropt, weep∣ing,
upon a chair. Should the duel take place, and
any fatal consequences follow, she felt she should
never be happy again; and even, should it be pre∣vented,
its very suggestion, from so horrible a
doubt of her character, seemed a stain from which
it could never recover. The inconsiderate facility
with which she had wandered about with a person
so little known to her, so underbred, and so for∣ward,
appeared now to herself inexcusable; and
she determined, if but spared this dreadful punish∣ment,
to pass the whole of her future life in un∣remitting
caution.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with the kindest sympathy, and Indi∣ana
and Miss Margland, with extreme curiosity,
sought to discover the reason of her emotion; but
while begging them to dispense with an explana∣tion,
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
old Mr. Westwyn was announced and ap∣peared.</P>
<P>The horrors of a culprit, the most cruel as well
as criminal, seemed instantly the portion of the
self-condemned Camilla; and, as he advanced with
chearful kindness, to inquire after her health, his
ignorance that all his happiness, through her
means, was that moment at stake, pierced her with
a suffering so exquisite, that she uttered a deep
groan, and sunk back upon her chair.</P>
<P>An instant's recollection brought her more of
fortitude, though not of comfort; and springing
up and addressing, though not looking at Mr.
Westwyn, who was staring at her with astonish∣ment
and concern: “Where, sir,” she cried, “is
your son? If you have the least knowledge which
way he is gone—which way he may be traced—
pursue and force him back this moment!—Imme∣diately!—”</P>
<P>“My son!” repeated the good old gentleman,
wanting no other word to participate in any alarm;
“what, Hal Westwyn?—”</P>
<P>“Follow him—seek—him—send for him—and
do not, a single instant, lose sight of him all
day!—”</P>
<P>“My dear young lady, what do you mean? I'll
send for him, to be sure, if you desire it; but what
makes you so good as to think about my son? did
you ever see my son? do you know my son? do
you know Hal Westwyn?”</P>
<P>“Don't ask now, dear sir! secure him first, and
make what inquiries you please afterwards.”</P>
<P>Mr. Westwyn, in evident consternation, walked
out, Camilla herself opening the door; but turn∣ing
back in the passage, strongly said: “If the boy
has been guilty of any misbehaviour, I won't sup∣port
him; I don't like misbehaviour; it's a bad
thing; I can't take to it.”</P>
<P>“O no! no! quite the contrary!” exclaimed the
agitated Camilla, he is good, kind, generous! I
owe him the greatest obligation! and I desire
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
nothing upon earth so much, at this moment, as to
see him, and to thank him!”</P>
<P>The old gentleman's eyes now filled with tears,
and coming back, and most affectionately shaking
hands with her, “I was afraid he had misbehaved,”
he cried; “but he was always a good lad; and if
he has done any thing for the niece of my dear
Sir Hugh Tyrold, I shall hug him to my heart!”
and then, in great, but pleased perturbation, he
hurried away, saying to himself, as he went: “I'll
take him to her, to be sure; I desire nothing
better! God bless her! If she can speak so well of
my poor Hal, she must be the best girl living! and
she shall have him—yes, she shall have him, if she's
a mind to him; and I don't care if she i'n't worth
a groat; she's niece to my old friend; that's
better.”</P>
<P>Camilla speeding, but not hearing him, returned
to her seat; yet could not answer one question,
from the horrors of her fears, and her shame of the
detail of the business.</P>
<P>When the breakfast was over, Miss Margland
desired every one would get ready to go the lodg∣ings;
and, with Indiana, repaired herself to visit
them, and give general orders. Dr. Marchmont
had glided out of the room, in anxiety for Edgar;
to the great dissatisfaction, and almost contempt of
Dr. Orkborne, with whom he was just discussing
some controverted points upon the shield of Achil∣les;
which, that he could quit for the light concerns
of a young man, added again to his surmises that,
though he had run creditably the usual scholastic
race, his reputation was more the effect of general
ability and address, than of such sound and consum∣mate
learning as he himself possessed. Ruminating
upon the ignorant injustice of mankind, in suffer∣ing
such quacks in literature and philology to
carry the palm of fame, he went to his chamber, to
collect, from his bolster and bedside, the hoard of
books and papers, from which, the preceding
night, he had disencumbered his coat, waistcoat,
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
and great coat pockets, inside and out, to review
before he could sleep; and which now were again
to encircle him, to facilitate their change of
abode.</P>
<P>But Eugenia would not quit her afflicted sister,
who soon, in her gentle breast, deposited the whole
of her grief, her apprehensions, and her plans;
charging her instantly to retire, if Edgar should
return, that whatever might be the event he should
unfold, she might release him immediately from an
engagement that his last words seemed to avow
did not make him happy, and that probably he
now repented. The design was so consonant to
the native heroism of Eugenia, that she consented,
with applause, to aid its execution.</P>
<P>About half an hour, which seemed to be pro∣longed
to twenty times the duration of the whole
day, passed in terrible expectation; Edgar then ap∣peared,
and Eugenia, suspending her earnest cu∣riosity,
to comply with the acute feelings of her
sister, retreated.</P>
<P>Camilla could scarce breathe; she stood up, her
eyes and mouth open, her face pale, her hands up∣lifted,
waiting, but not daring to demand intelli∣gence.</P>
<P>Edgar, entering into her distress with a tender∣ness
that drove from him his own, eagerly satis∣fied
her: “All,” he cried, “is safe; the affair has
been compromised: no duel has taken place; and
the parties have mutually pledged themselves to
forget the dispute.”</P>
<P>Tears again, but no longer bitter, flowed copi∣ously
down her cheeks, while her raised eyes and
clasped hands expressed the fervency of her thank∣fulness.</P>
<P>Edgar, extremely touched, took her hand; he
wished to seize a moment so nearly awful, to en∣force
upon her mind every serious subject with
which he most desired it to be impressed; but sor∣row
was ever sacred to him: and desiring only, at
this period, to console her: “This adventure,” he
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
cried, “has now terminated so well, you must not
suffer it to wound you. Dismiss it, sweet Camilla,
from your memory!—at least till you are more
composed.”</P>
<P>“No, sir!” cried Camilla, to whom his softness,
by restoring her hope of an ultimately happy con∣clusion,
restored strength; “it ought never to be
dismissed from my memory; and what I am now
going to say will fix it there indelibly.”</P>
<P>Edgar was surprised, but pleased; his most anxi∣ous
wishes seemed on the point of being fulfilled;
he expected a voluntary explanation of every per∣plexity,
a clearance of all mystery.</P>
<P>“I am sensible that I have appeared to you,”
she resumed, “in many points reprehensible; in
some, perhaps, inexcusable—”</P>
<P>“Inexcusable? O no! never! never!”</P>
<P>“The letters of Sir Sedley Clarendel I know
you think I ought not to have received—”</P>
<P>Edgar, biting his nails, looked down.</P>
<P>“And, indeed, I acknowledge myself, in that
affair, a most egregious dupe!—”</P>
<P>She blushed; but her blush was colourless to
that of Edgar. Resentment against Sir Sedley beat
high in every vein; while disappointment to his
delicacy, in the idea of Camilla duped by any man,
seemed, in one blow, to detach him from her per∣son,
by a sudden dissolution of all charm to his
mind in the connection.</P>
<P>Camilla saw, too late, she had been too hasty in
a confession which some apologising account should
have preceded; but what her courage had begun,
pride now aided her to support, and she continued.</P>
<P>“For what belongs to that correspondence, and
even for its being unknown to my friends, I may
offer, perhaps, hereafter, something in exculpa∣tion;—hereafter,
I say, building upon your long
family regard; for though we part—it will be, I
trust, in amity.”</P>
<P>“Part!” repeated Edgar recovering from his
displeasure by amazement.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26"/>
“Yes, part,” said she, with assumed firmness;
“it would be vain to palliate what I cannot dis∣guise
from myself—I am lessened in your esteem.”
She could not go on; imperious shame took pos∣session
of her voice, crimsoned her very forehead,
blushed even in her eyes, demolished her strained
energy, and enfeebled her genuine spirit.</P>
<P>But the conscious taciturnity of Edgar recalled
her exertions; struck and afflicted by the truth she
had pronounced, he could not controvert it; he
was mute; but his look spoke keen disturbance and
bitter regret.</P>
<P>“Not so low, however, am I yet, I trust, fallen
in your opinion, that you can wonder at the step I
now take. I am aware of many errours; I know,
too, that appearances have often cruelly misrepre∣sented
me; my errours you might have the can∣dour
to forget, and false appearances I could easily
clear in my own favour—but where, and what is
the talisman which can erase from my own re∣membrance
that you have thought me unworthy?”</P>
<P>Edgar started; but she would not give him time
to speak; what she had last uttered was too pain∣ful
to her to dwell upon, or hear answered, and
rapidly, and in an elevated manner, she went on.</P>
<P>“I here, therefore, solemnly release you from
all tie, all engagement whatever with Camilla
Tyrold! I shall immediately acquaint my friends
that henceforth—we Both are Free!</P>
<P>She was then retiring. Edgar, confounded by a
stroke so utterly and every way unexpected, neither
answering nor interposing, till he saw her hand
upon the lock of the door. In a voice then, that
spoke him cut to the soul, though without at∣tempting
to stop her, “This then,” he cried,
“Camilla is your final adieu.”</P>
<P>She turned round, and with a face glowing, and
eyes glistening, held out to him her hand: “I
knew not if you would accept,” she said “a
kinder word, or I should have assured you of my
unaltered regard—and have claimed the continu∣ance
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
of your friendship, and even—if your pati∣ence
is not utterly exhausted, of your watchful
counsel—Farewell! remember me without seve∣rity!
my own esteem must be permanent as my ex∣istence!”</P>
<P>The door, here, was opened by Miss Margland
and Indiana, and Camilla hastily snatched away the
hand which Edgar, grasping with the fondness of
renovated passion, secretly meant to part with no
more, till a final reconciliation once again made it
his own; but compelled to yield to circumstance,
he suffered it to be withdrawn; and while she
darted into the chamber of Eugenia, to hide her
deep emotions from Indiana, who was tittering,
and Miss Margland, who was sneering, at the situ∣ation
in which she was suprised, he abruptly took
leave himself, too much impressed by this critical
scene, to labour for uninteresting discourse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ideas upon Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE, in the bosom of her faithful sister,
Camilla reposed her feelings and her fears, al∣ternately
rejoicing and trembling at the temerity
of the resolution she had exerted; Edgar sought
his not less faithful and honourable, but far more
worldly friend, Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>He narrated, with extreme emotion, the scene he
had just had with Camilla; asserting her possession
of every species of excellence from the nobleness
of her rejection, and abhorring himself for having
given her a moment's doubt of his fullest esteem.
Not a solicitude, he declared, now remained with
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
him, but how to appease her displeasure, satisfy
her dignity, and recover her favour.</P>
<P>“Softly, softly!” said the Doctor; “measure
your steps more temperately, ere you run with
such velocity. If this refusal is the result of an
offended sensibility, you cannot exert yourself too
warmly in its consolation; even if it is from pride,
it has a just claim to your concessions, since she
thinks you have injured it; yet pause before you
act, may it not be merely from a confidence of
power that loves to tyrannize over its slaves, by
playing with their chains? or a lurking spirit of
coquetry, that desires to regain the liberty of trifl∣ing
with some new Sir Sedley Clarendel or, per∣haps,
with Sir Sedley himself?”</P>
<P>“Dr. Marchmont! how wretchedly ill you
think of women!”</P>
<P>“I think of them as they are! I think of them
as I have found them. They are artful, though
feeble; they are shallow, yet subtle.”</P>
<P>“You have been unfortunate in your con∣nexions?”</P>
<P>“Yet who had better prospects? with energies
as warm, with hopes as lively as your own, twice
have I conducted to the altar two beings I thought
framed for my peculiar felicity; but my peace,
my happiness, and my honour, have been torn up
by the root, exactly where I thought I had planted
them for my whole temporal existence. This
heart, which to you appears hard and suspicious,
has been the dupe of its susceptibilities; first,
in a creature of its own choice, next, where it be∣lieved
itself chosen. That first, Mandlebert, had
you seen her, you would have thought, as I thought
her myself—an angel! She was another Camilla.”</P>
<P>“Another Camilla!”</P>
<P>“Grace, sweetness, and beauty vied in her for
pre-eminence. Yes, another Camilla! though I
see your incredulity; I see you think my compa∣rison
almost prosane; and that grace, sweetness,
and beauty, awaited the birth of Camilla to be made
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
known to the world. Such, however, she was, and
I saw and loved at once. I knew her character
fair, I precipitately made my addresses, and con∣cluded
myself beloved in return—because I was
accepted!”</P>
<P>Edgar shrunk back, and cast down his eyes.</P>
<P>“Nor was it till the moment—heart-breaking
yet to my recollection!—of her sudden death, that
I knew the lifeless, soulless, inanimate frame was
all she had bestowed upon me. In the private
drawer of her bureau, I then found a pocket-book.
In the first leaf, I saw a gentleman's name;—I
turned over, and saw it again; I looked further,
and still it met my view; I opened by chance,—
but nothing else appeared:—there it was still,
traced in every hand, charactered in every form,
shape, and manner, the wayward, wistful eye could
delight to fashion, for varying, yet beholding it
without end: while, over the intermediate spaces,
verses, quotations, short but affecting sentences,
were every where scattered, bewailing the misery
of disappointed hope, and unrequited love; of a
heartless hand devoted at the altar; of vows en∣chaining
liberty, not satisfying affection! I then
—alas, too late! dived deeper, with, then, useless
investigation,—and discovered an early passion,
never erased from her mind;—discovered—that I
had never made her happy! that she was merely
enduring, suffering me—while my whole confid∣ing
soul was undividedly hers!”—</P>
<P>Edgar shuddered at this picture; “But why,
then,” he cried, “since she seemed amiable as well
as fair, why did she accept you?”</P>
<P>“Ask half the married women in the nation
how they became wives: they will tell you their
friends urged them;—that they had no other esta∣blishment
in view;—that nothing is so uncertain
as the repetition of matrimonial powers in women;
—and that those who cannot solicit what they
wish, must accommodate themselves to what of∣fers.
This first adventure, however, is now no
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
longer useful to you, though upon its hard re∣membrance
was founded my former caution: but
I am even myself satisfied, at present, that the ear∣liest
partiality of Camilla has been yours; what
now you have to weigh is, the strength or inadequacy
of her character, for guiding that partiality to
your mutual happiness. My second melancholy
history will best illustrate this difficulty. You
may easily believe, the last of my intentions was
any further essay in a lottery I had found so in∣auspicious;
but, while cold even to apathy, it was
my inevitable chance to fall in the way of a pleas∣ing
and innocent young creature, who gave me,
unsought and unwished for, her heart. The
boon, nevertheless, soon caught my own: for
what is so alluring as the voluntary affection of a
virtuous woman?”</P>
<P>“Well,” cried Edgar, “and what now could
disturb your tranquillity?”</P>
<P>“The insufficiency of that heart to its own de∣cision.
I soon found that her apparent predilec∣tion
was simply the result of the casualty which
brought me almost exclusively into her society,
but unmarked by any consonance of taste, feeling,
or understanding. Her inexperience had made her
believe, since she preferred me to the few who sur∣rounded
her, I was the man of her choice: with
equal facility I concurred in the same mistake;—
for what is so credulous as self-love? But such a
regard, the child of accident, not selection, was
unequal, upon the discovery of the dissimilarity of
our dispositions, to the smallest sacrifice. My
melancholy returned with the view of our mutual
delusion; lassitude of pleasing was the precursor of
discontent. Dissipation then, in the form of amuse∣ment,
presented itself to her aid: retirement and
books to came mine. My resource was safe, though
solitary; her's was gay, but perilous. Dissipation,
with its usual Proteus powers, from amusement
changed its form to temptation, allured her into
dangers, impeached her honour, and blighted her
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
with disgrace. I just discerned the precipice
whence she was falling, in time to avert the dreadful
necessity of casting her off for ever:—but what was
our life thence forward? Cares unparticipated,
griefs uncommunicated, stifled resentments, and
unremitting weariness! She is now no more; and
I am a lonely individual for the rest of my pilgri∣mage.</P>
<P>“Take warning, my dear young friend, by my
experience. The entire possession of the heart of
the woman you marry is not more essential to your
first happiness, than the complete knowledge of her
disposition is to your ultimate peace.”</P>
<P>Edgar thanked him, in deep concern to have
awakened emotions which the absorption of study,
and influence of literature, held generally dor∣mant.
The lesson, however, which they incul∣cated,
he engaged to keep always present to his
consideration; though, but for the strange affair
of Sir Sedley Clarendel, he should feel confident
that, in Camilla, there was not more of exterior
attraction, than of solid excellence: and, with re∣gard
to their concordance of taste and humour, he
had never seen her so gay, nor so lovely, as in
scenes of active benevolence, or domestic life. She
had promised to clear, hereafter, the transaction
with Sir Sedley; but he could not hold back for
that explanation: hurt, already, by his apparent
scruples, she had openly named them as the motives
of her rejection: could he, then, shew her he yet
demurred, without forfeiting all hope of a future
accommodation?</P>
<P>“Delicacy,” said Dr. Marchmont, “though the
quality the most amiable we can practise in the ser∣vice
of others, must not take place of common
sense, and sound judgment, for ourselves. Her
dismission does not discard you from her society;
on the contrary, it invites your friendship—”</P>
<P>“Ah, Doctor! what innocence, what sweetness
does that very circumstance display!”</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32"/>
“Learn, however, their concomitants, ere you
yield to their charms: learn if their source is
from a present, yet accidental preference, or from
the nobler spring of elevated sentiment. The
meeting you surprised with Sir Sedley, the pre∣sumption
you acknowledge of his letters, and the
confession made by herself that she had submitted
to be duped by him.”</P>
<P>“O, Dr. Marchmont! what harrowing draw∣backs
to felicity! And how much must we rather pity
than wonder at the errors of common young wo∣men,
when a creature such as this is so easy to be
misled!”</P>
<P>“You must not imagine I mean a censure upon
the excellent Mr. Tyrold, when I say she is left
too much to herself: the purity of his principles, and
the virtue of his character, must exempt him from
blame; but his life has been both too private and
too tranquil to be aware of the dangers run by
Female Youth, when straying from the mother's
careful wing. All that belongs to religion, and to
principle, he feels, and he has taught; but the impe∣diments
they have to encounter in a commerce
with mankind, he could not point out, for he does
not know. Yet there is nothing more certain,
than that seventeen weeks is not less able to go
alone in a nursery, than seventeen years in the
world.”</P>
<P>This suggestion but added to the bias of Edgar
to take her, if possible, under his own immediate
guidance.</P>
<P>“Know, first,” cried the Doctor, “if to your
guidance she will give way; know if the affair with
Sir Sedley has exculpations which render it single
and adventitious, or if there hang upon it a light∣ness
of character that may invest caprice, chance,
or fickleness, with powers of involving such an∣other
entanglement.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How to treat a Defamer.</HEAD>
<P>AS the lodgings taken by Miss Margland could
not be ready till the afternoon, Camilla re∣mained
with her sister; a sojourn which, while it
consoled her with the society, and gratified her by
the approbation of Eugenia, had yet another al∣lurement;
it detained her under the same roof with
Edgar; and his manner of listening to her rejection,
and his undisguised suffering before they were
parted, led her to expect he might yet demand a
conference before she quitted the hotel.</P>
<P>In about an hour, as unpleasantly as unceremo∣niously,
they were broken in upon by Mrs. Mitten.
“How monstro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lucky, my dear,” cried she to
Camilla, “that I should find you, and your little
sister, for I suppose this is she, together! I went
into your dining room to ask for you, and there I
met those other two ladies; and I've made ac∣quaintance
with 'em, I assure you, already; for I
told them I was on a visit at the Honourable Mrs.
Berlinton's. So I've had the opportunity to re∣commend
some shops to 'em, and I've been to tell
some of the good folks to send them some of their
nicest goods for'em to look at; for, really, since I've
been bustling a little about here, I've found some
of the good people so vastly obliging, I can't but
take a pleasure in serving 'em, and getting 'em a
few customers, especially as I know a little civility
of that sort makes one friends suprisingly. Often
and often have I got things under prime cost my∣self,
only by helping a person on in his trade. So
one can't say good nature's always thrown away.
However, I come now on purpose to put a note
into your own hands, from Mrs. Berlinton; for
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
all the servants were out of the way, except one, and
he wanted to be about something else, so I offered to
bring it, and she was very much pleased; so I fancy
its about some secret, for she never offered to shew it
me; but as to the poor man I saved from the walk,
I've won his heart downright; I dare say he'll go of
any odd errand for me, now, without vails. That's
the best of good nature, it always comes home to
one.”</P>
<P>The note from Mrs. Berlinton contained a tender
supplication for the return of Camilla, and a pressing
and flattering invitation that her sister should join their
little party, as the motives of honour and discretion
which made her, at the request and for the sake of her
brother, sacrifice her eagerness to be presented to Miss
Lynmere, operated not to impede her acquaintance
with Miss Eugenia.</P>
<P>This proposition had exquisite charms for Eugenia.
To become acquainted with the sister of him to whom,
henceforward, she meant to devote her secret thoughts,
enchanted her imagination. Camilla, therefore, ne∣gotiated
the visit with Miss Margland, who, though
little pleased by this separate invitation, knew not
how to refuse her concurrence; but Indiana, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dig∣nant
that the sister of Melmond should not, first, have
waited upon her, and solicited her friendship, pri∣vately
resolved, in pique of this disrespect, to punish
the brother with every rigour she could invent.</P>
<P>Camilla, upon her return, found Mrs. Mitten al∣ready
deeply engaged in proposing an alteration in the
dress of Eugenia, which she was aiding Molly Mill to
accomplish; and so much she found to say and to do,
to propose and to object to, to contrive and to alter,
that, from the simplicity of the mistress, and the igno∣rance
of the maid, the one was soon l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to conclude
she should have appeared improperly before Mrs. Ber∣linton,
without such useful advice; and the other to
believe she must shortly have lost her place, now her
young lady was come forth into the world, if she had
not thus miraculously met with so good a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35"/>
During these preparations, Camilla was summoned
back to the dining-room to receive Mr. Westwyn.</P>
<P>She did not hear this call with serenity. The
danger which, however unwittingly, she had caused
his son, and the shocking circumstances which were
its foundation, tinged her cheeks, and confounded her
wish of making acknowledgments, with an horror that
such an obligation could be possible.</P>
<P>The door of the dining-room was open, and as soon
as her steps were heard, Mr. Westwyn came smiling
forth to receive her. She hung back involuntarily;
but, pacing up to her, and taking her hand, “Well,
my good young lady,” he cried, “I have brought
you my son; but he's no boaster, that I can assure
you, for though I told him how you wanted him to
come to you, and was so good as to say you were so
much obliged to him, I can't make him own he has
ever seen you in his life; which I tell him is carrying
his modesty over far; I don't like affectation—I have
no taste for it.”</P>
<P>Camilla, discovering by this speech, as well as by
his pleased and tranquil manner, that he had escaped
hearing of the intended duel, and that his son was still
ignorant whose cause he had espoused, ardently wished
to avert farther shame by concealing herself; and, step
by step, kept retreating back towards the room of
Eugenia; though she could not disengage her hand
from the old gentleman, who, trying to draw her on,
said: “Come, my dear! don't go away. Though
my son won't confess what he has done for you, he
can't make me forget that you were such a dear soul
as to tell me yourself, of his good behaviour, and of
your having such a kind opinion of him. And I have
been telling him, and I can assure you I'll keep my
word, that if he has done a service to the niece of
my dear old friend, Sir Hugh Tyrold, it shall value
him fifty pounds a-year more to his income, if I
straighten myself never so much. For a lad, that
knows how to behave in that manner, will never
spend his money so as to make his old father ashamed
of him. And that's a good thing for a man to know.”</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36"/>
“Indeed, sir, this is some mistake,” said the
young man himself, now advancing into the passage,
while Camilla was stammering out an excuse from
entering; “it's some great mistake; I have not the
honour to know—”</P>
<P>He was going to add Miss Tyrold, but he saw her
at the same moment, and instantly recollecting her
face, stopt, blushed, and looked amazed.</P>
<P>The retreating effort of Camilla, her shame and her
pride, all subsided by his view, and gave place to the
more generous feelings of gratitude for his intuitive
good opinion, and emotion for the risk he had run in
her defence; and with an expression of captivating
sweetness in her eyes and manner, “That you did
not know me,” she cried, “makes the peculiarity of
your goodness, which, indeed, I am more sensible to
than I can express.”</P>
<P>“Why, there! there, now! there!” cried Mr.
Westwyn, while his son, enchanted to find whose
character he had sustained, bowed almost to the
ground with respectful gratitude for such thanks;
“only but listen! she says the very same things to
your face, that she said behind your back! though I
am afraid it's only to please an old father; for if not,
I can't for my life find out any reason why you should
deny it. Come, Hal, speak out, Hal!”</P>
<P>Equally at a loss how either to avow or evade
what had passed in the presence of Camilla, young
Westwyn began a stammering an awkward apology;
but Camilla, feeling doubly his forbearance, said:
“Silence may in you be delicate—but in me it would
be graceless.” Then, turning from him to old Mr.
Westwyn, “you may be proud, sir,” she cried, “of
your son! It was the honour of an utter stranger he
was protecting, as helpless as she was unknown at the
time she excited his interest; nor bad he even in view
this poor mede he now receives of her thanks!”</P>
<P>“My dearest Hal!” cried Mr. Westwyn, wringing
him by the hand; “if you have but one small grain
of regard for me, don't persist in denying this! I'd
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
give the last hundred pounds I had in the world to be
sure it was true!”</P>
<P>“That to hear the name of this lady,” said the
young man, “should not be necessary to inspire me with
respect for her, who can wonder? that any opportu∣nity
could arise in which she should want defence, is
all that can give any surprise.”</P>
<P>“You own it, then, my dear Hal? you own you've
done her a kindness? why then, my dear Hal, you've
done one to me! and I can't help giving you a hug
for it, let who will think me an old fool?”</P>
<P>He then fervently embraced his son, who confused,
though gratified, strove vainly to make disclaiming
speeches. “No, no, my dear Hal,” he cried, “you
sha'n't let yourself down with me again, I promise,
you, though you've two or three times tried to make
me think nothing of you; but this young lady here,
dear soul, speaks another language; she says I may be
proud of my son! and I dare say she knows why, for
she's a charming girl, as ever I saw; so I will be proud
of my son! Poor dear Hal! thou hast got a good
friend. I can tell thee, in that young lady! and she's
niece to the best man I ever knew; and I value her
good opinion more than any body's.”</P>
<P>“You are much too good,” cried Camilla, in an
accent of tender pleasure, the result of grateful joy,
that she had not been the means of destroying the pa∣ternal
happiness of so fond a father, joined to the
dreadful certainty how narrowly she had escaped that
misery; “you are much too good, and I blush even
to thank you, when I think—”</P>
<P>What she meant to add was in a moment forgotten,
and that she blushed ceased to be metaphorical, when
now, as they all three entered the dining-room toge∣ther,
the first object that met her eyes was Edgar.</P>
<P>Their eyes met not again; delighted and consci∣ous,
she turned hers hastily away. He comes, thought
she, to reclaim me! he will not submit to the separa∣tion;
he comes to re-assure me of his esteem, and to
receive once more my faithful heart!</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38"/>
Edgar had seen, by chance, the Westwyns pass
to the room of the Cleves party, and felt the most
ardent desire to know if they would meet with
Camilla, and what would be her reception of her
young champion, whose sword, with extreme trou∣ble,
he had himself that morning sheathed, and
whose gallantry he attributed to a vehement, how∣ever
sudden passion. Dr. Marchmont acknowledg∣ed
the epoch to be highly interesting for observa∣tion,
and, presuming upon their old right of inti∣macy
with all the party, they abruptly made a se∣cond
visit.</P>
<P>Miss Margland and Indiana, who were examin∣ing
some goods sent by Mrs. Mittin, had received
them all four without much mark of civility; and
Mr. Westwyn immediately desired Camilla to be
sent for, and kept upon the watch, till her step
made him hasten out to meet her.</P>
<P>Edgar could not hear unmoved the dialogue
which ensued; he imagined an amiable rival was
suddenly springing up in young Westwyn, at the
very moment of his own dismission, which he now
even thought possible this incipient conquest had
urged; and when Camilla, walking between the
father and the son, with looks of softest sensibility,
came into the room, he thought he had never seen
her so lovely, and that her most bewitching smiles
were purposely lavished for their captivation.</P>
<P>With this idea, he found it impossible to speak
to her; their situation, indeed, was too critical for
any common address, and when he saw that she
turned from him, he attempted to converse with
the other ladies upon their purchases; and Camilla,
left to her two new beaux, had the unavoidable
appearance of being engrossed by them, though
the sight of Edgar instantly robbed them of all
real attention.</P>
<P>Soon after, the door was again opened, and Mr.
Girt, the young persumer, came, smirking and
scraping, into the room with a box of various toys,
essences, and cosmetics, recommended by Mrs.
Mittin.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39"/>
Ignorant of the mischief he had done her, and
not even recollecting to have seen him, Camilla
made one to look at his goods; but Edgar, to whom
his audacious assertions were immediately brought
back by his fight, would have made him feel the
effects of his resentment, had not his passion for
Camilla been of so solid, as well as warm a texture,
as to induce him to prefer guarding her delicacy,
to any possible display he could make of his feel∣ings
to others, or even to herself.</P>
<P>Mr. Girt, in the midst of his exhibition of me∣morandum
books, smelling bottles, tooth-pick
cases, and pocket mirrors; with washes to immor∣talize
the skin, powders becoming to all counte∣nances,
and pomatums to give natural tresses to old
age, suddenly recollected Camilla. The gross mis∣take
he had made he had already discovered, by
having dodged her to the house of Mrs Berlinton;
but all alarm at it had ceased, by finding, through
a visit made to his shop by Mrs. Mittin, that she
was uninformed he had propagated it. Not gifted
with the discernment to see in the air and manner
of Camilla her entire, though unassuming superio∣rity
to her accidental associate, he concluded them
both to be relations of some of the upper domestics;
and with a look and tone descending from the most
profound adulation, with which he was presenting
his various articles to Miss Margland and Indiana,
into a familiarity the most facetious, “O dear,
ma'am,” he cried, “I did not see you at first; I
hope t'other lady's well that's been so kind as to
recommend me? Indeed I saw her just now.”</P>
<P>Young Westwyn, to whom, as to Edgar, the bold
defamation of Girt occurred with his presence,
but whom none of the nameless delicacies of the
peculiar situation, and peculiar character of Edgar,
restrained into silence, felt such a disgust at the pre∣sumption
of effrontery that gave him courage for
this facetious address, to a young lady whose inno∣cence
of his ill usage made him think its injury double,
<PB N="39" REF="40"/>
that unable to repress his indignation, he abruptly
whispered in his ear, “Walk out of the room, sir!”</P>
<P>The amazed perfumer, at this haughty and un∣expected
order, stared, and cried aloud, “No
offence, I hope, sir?”</P>
<P>Mr. Westwyn asked what was the matter? while
Camilla, crimsoned by the familiar assurance with
which she had been addressed, retired to a window.</P>
<P>“Nothing of any moment, sir,” answered Hen∣ry;
and again, in a low but still more positive
voice, he repeated his command to Girt.</P>
<P>“Sir, I'm not used to be used in this manner!”
answered he, hardily, and hoping, by raising his
tone, for the favourable intervention of the company.</P>
<P>Indiana, now, was preparing to scream, and
Miss Margland was looking round to see whom
she should reprehend; but young Westwyn, coolly
opening the door, with a strong arm, and an able
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erk, twisted the perfumer into the passage, saying,
“You may send somebody for your goods.”</P>
<P>Girt, who equally strong, but not equally adroit
as Henry, strove in vain to resist, vowed vengeance
for this assault. Henry, without seeming to hear
him, occupied himself with looking at what he had
left. Camilla felt her eyes suffuse with tears; and
Edgar, for the first time in his life, found himself
visited by the baleful passion of envy.</P>
<P>Miss Margland could not comprehend what this
meant; Indiana comprehended but too much in
finding there was some disturbance of which she
was not the object; but Mr Westwyn, losing his
look of delight, said, with something of severity,
“Hal! what did you turn that man out of the
room for?”</P>
<P>“He is perfectly aware of my reason, sir,” said
Henry; and then added it was a long story, which
he begged to relate another time.</P>
<P>The blank face of Mr. Westwyn shewed displea∣sure
and mortification. He lifted the head of his
cane to his mouth, and after biting it for some
time, with a frowning countenance, muttered, “I
<PB N="40" REF="41"/>
don't like to see a man turned out of a room. If
he's done any harm, tell him so; and if it's worse
than harm, souse him in a horse-pond; I've no ob∣jection:
But I don't like to see a man turned out of
a room; it's very unmannerly; and I did not think
Hal would do such a thing.” Then suddenly, and
with a succinct bow, bidding them all good bye, he
took a hasty leave; still, however, muttering, all
the way along the passage, and down the stairs,
loud enough to be heard: “Kicking and jerking a
man about does not prove him to be in the wrong.
I thought Hal had been more of a gentleman. If
I don't find the man turns out to be a rascal, Hal
shall beg his pardon; for I don't like to see a man
turned out of a room.</P>
<P>Henry, whose spirit was as irritable as it was ge∣nerous,
felt acutely this public censure, which,
though satisfied he did not deserve, every species
of propriety prohibited his explaining away. With
a forced smile, therefore, and a silent bow, he fol∣lowed
his father.</P>
<P>Miss Margland and Indiana now burst forth with a
torrent of wonders, conjectures and questions; but
the full heart of Camilla denied her speech, and
the carriage of Mrs. Berlinton being already at the
door, she called upon Eugenia, and followed, per∣force,
by Mrs. Mittin, left the Hotel.</P>
<P>Edgar and Dr. Marchmont gave neither surprise
nor concern by retiring instantly to their own
partment.</P>
<P>“Dr. Marchmont,” said the former, in a tone
of assumed moderation, “I have lost Camilla! I
see it plainly. This young man steps forward so
gallantly, so ingenuously, nay so amiably, that the
contrast—chill, severe, and repulsive—must render
me—in this detestable state—insupportable to all
her feelings. Dr. Marchmont! I have not a doubt
of the event!”</P>
<P>“The juncture, is, indeed, perilous, and the
trial of extremest hazard; but it is such as draws
all uncertainty to a crisis, and, therefore, is not
<PB N="41" REF="42"/>
much to be lamented. You may safely, I think,
rest upon it your destiny. To a generous female
heart a duel is the most dangerous of all assaults,
and the most fascinating of all charms; and a duel∣list,
though precisely what a woman most should
dread, as most exposing her to public notice, is the
person of all others she can, commonly, least resist.
By this test, then, prove your Camilla. Her cham∣pion
seems evidently her admirer, and his father
her adorer. Her late engagement with you may
possibly not reach them; or reaching but with its
dissolution, serve only to render them more eager.”</P>
<P>“Do you suppose him,” cried Edgar, after a
pause of strong disturbance; “do you suppose
him rich?”</P>
<P>“Certainly not. That the addition of fifty
pounds a-year, to his income should be any object,
proves his fortune to be very moderate.”</P>
<P>“Clear her, then, at least,” said he, with a so∣lemnity
almost reproachful; “clear her, at least,
of every mercenary charge! If I lose her—” he
gasped for breath—“she will not, you find, be
bought from me! and pique, anger, injustice, nay
inconstancy, all are less debasing than the sordid
corruption of which you suspected her.”</P>
<P>“This does not, necessarily, prove her disinter∣ested;
she is too young, yet, to know herself the
value she may hereafter set upon wealth. And,
independent of that inexperience, there is com∣monly
so little stability, so little internal hold, in
the female character, that any sudden glare of ad∣ventitious
lure, will draw them, for the moment,
from any and every regular plan of substantial be∣nefit.
It remains, therefore, now, to be tried, if
Beech Park, and its master united; can vie with
the bright and intoxicating incense of a life volun∣tarily
risked, in support—not of her fair same, that
was unknown to its defender—but simply of the
fair countenance which seemed its pledge.”</P>
<P>Edgar, heartless and sad, attempted no further
argument; he thought the Doctor prejudiced against
<PB N="42" REF="43"/>
the merits of Camilla; yet it appeared, even to
himself, that her whole conduct, from the short
period of his open avowal, had seemed a wilful se∣ries
of opposition to his requests and opinions.
And while terror for surrounding dangers gave
weight to his disapprobation of her visiting South-hampton,
with a lady she knew him to think more
attractive than safe or respectable, her sufferance
of the vulgar and forward Mrs. Mittin, with whom
again he saw her quit the hotel, was yet more of∣fensive,
since he could conceive for it no other in∣ducement
than a careless, if not determined hu∣mour,
to indulge every impulse, in equal contempt
of his counsel, and her own reflection.</P>
<P>All blame, however, of Camilla, was short of his
self-dissatisfaction, in the distance imposed upon
him by uncertainty, and the coldness dictated by
discretion, at a period so sensitive, when her spirit
was alarmed, and her delicacy was wounded, that
a stranger should start forward, to vindicate her in∣nocence,
and chastise its detractors, was singular,
was unfortunate, was nearly intolerable; and he
thought he could with thankfulness, have renounc∣ed
half his fortune, to have been himself the sole
protector of Camilla.</P>

<P>THE two sisters were silent from the hotel to

return of Edgar, Camilla was sunk into the lowest

meeting: while Eugenia was absorbed in mute joy,

and wrapt in expectation. But Mrs. Mittin, un∣disturbed

<P>Eugenia was enraptured. Ah! thought she, this
is indeed the true sister of the accomplished Mel∣mond!—she
shall share with him my adoration.
My heart shall be devoted—after my own dear fa∣mily—to
the homage of their perfections!</P>
<P>The ode, to her great delight, lasted till the din∣ner
was announced, when Melmond appeared: but
her prepossession could alone give any charm to his
sight: he could barely recollect that he had seen
her, or even Camilla before; he had conversed
with neither; his eyes had been devoted to Indiana,
and the despondence which had become his portion
since the news of the marriage of his aunt, seemed
but rendered the more peculiarly bitter, by this
intimate connection with the family of an object so
adored.</P>
<P>Yet, though nothing could be more spiritless
than the hour of dinner, Eugenia discovered in it
no deficiency; she had previously settled, that the
presence of Melmond could only breathe sweets and
perfection, and the magic of prejudice works every
event into its own circle of expectation.</P>
<P>Melmond did not even accompany them back
to the drawing-room. Eugenia sighed; but no∣body
heard her. Mrs. Mitten said, she had some∣thing
of great consequence to do in her own room,
and Mrs. Berlinton, to divert the languor she
found creeping upon them all, had recourse to
Hammond's elegies.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45"/>
These were still reading, when servant brought
in the name of Lord Valhurst. “O, deny me to
him! deny me to him!” cried Mrs. Berlinton;
“'tis a relation of Mr. Berlinton's and I hate
him.”</P>
<P>The order was given, however, too late; he
entered the room.</P>
<P>The name, as Camilla knew it not, she had heard
unmoved; but the sight of a person who had so
largely contributed to shock and terrify her in the
bathing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> house, struck her with horror. Brought
up with the respect of other times, she had risen at
his entrance; but she turned suddenly round upon
recollecting him, and instead of the courtsie she in∣tended
making, involuntarily moved away her
chair from the part of the room to which he was
advancing.</P>
<P>This was unnoticed by Mrs. Berlinton, whose
chagrin at his intrusion made her wish to walk
away also; while with Lord Valhurst it only passed,
joined to her rising, for a mark of her being but
little accustomed to company. That Eugenia rose
too was not perceived, as she rather lost than
gained in height by standing.</P>
<P>Most obsequiously, but most unsuccessfully, the
peer made his court to Mrs. Berlinton; inquiring
after her health, with fulsome tenderness, and ex∣tolling
her good looks with nearly gross admiration.
Mrs. Berlinton listened, for she was incapable of
incivility; though, weary and disgusted, she seldom
made the smallest answer.</P>
<P>The two sisters might, with ease, equally have
escaped notice, since, though Mrs. Berlinton occa∣sionally
addressed them, the peer would never have
turned from herself, had not Mrs. Mitten, abruptly
entering in search of a pair of scissars, perceived
him, and hastily called out, “O lauk, sir, if it is not
you! I know you again well enough! But I hope,
now you see us in such good company as this good
lady's, you'll believe me another time, when I tell
you we're not the sort of persons you took us for!
<PB N="45" REF="46"/>
Miss Tyrold, my dear, I hope you've spoke to the
gentleman?”</P>
<P>Lord Valhurst with difficulty recollected Mrs.
Mitten, from the very cursory view his otherwise
occupied eyes had taken of her; but when the
concluding words made him look at Camilla,
whose youth and beauty were not so liable to be
forgotten, he knew at once her associate, and was
aware of the meaning of her harangue.</P>
<P>Sorry to appear before his fair kinswoman to any
disadvantage, though by no means displeased at an
opportunity of again seeing a young creature he
had thought so charming, he began an apology to
Mrs. Mitten while his eyes were fixed upon Ca∣milla,
vindicating himself from every intention
that was not respectful, and hoping she did not so
much injure as to mistake him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten was just beginning to answer that
she knew better, when the words, “Why, my
Lord, how have you offended Mrs. Mitten?”
dropping from Mrs. Berlinton, instantly new
strung all her notions. To find him a nobleman
was to find him innocent; for, though she did not
quite suppose that a peer was not a mortal, she had
never spoken to one before; and the power of
title upon the ear, like that of beauty upon the
eye, is, in its first novelty, all-commanding; mani∣fold
as are the drawbacks on the influence of either,
when awe is lost by familiarity and habitual re∣flection
takes place of casual and momentary admi∣ration.
Title then, as well as beauty, demands
mental auxiliaries; and those who possess either,
more watched than the common race, seem of
higher responsibility; but proportioned to the
censure they draw where they err, is the veneration
they inspire where their eminence is complete. Nor
is this the tribute of prejudice, as those who look up
to all superiority with envy love to aver; the impar∣tial
and candid reflectors upon human frailty, who, in
viewing it, see with its elevation its surrounding
temptations, will call it but the tribute of justice.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47"/>
To Mrs. Mitten, however, the mere found of a title
was enough; she felt its ascendance without examin∣ing
its claims, and, dropping the lowest courtsie her
knees could support, confusedly said, she hoped his
lordship would excuse her speaking so quick and im∣properly,
which she only did from not knowing who
he was; for, if she had known him better, she should
have been sure he was too much the gentleman to do
any thing with with an ill design.</P>
<P>His lordship courteously accepted the apology; and
advanced to Camilla, to express his hopes she had not
participated in such injurious suspicions.</P>
<P>She made no answer, and Mrs. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linton inquired
what all this meant?</P>
<P>“I protest, my dear madam,” said the peer, “I do
not well comprehend myself. I only see there has
been some misunderstanding; but I hope this young
lady will believe me, when I declare, upon my ho∣nour,
that I had no view but to offer my protection, at
the time I saw her under alarm.”</P>
<P>This was a declaration Camilla could not dispute,
and even felt inclined to credit, from the solemnity
with which it was uttered; but to discuss it was
every way impossible, and therefore, coldly bowing
her head, she seemed acquiescent.</P>
<P>Lord Valhurst now pretty equally divided his at∣tention
between these two beautiful young women;
looking at and complimenting them alternately, till a
servant came in and said, “The two Mr. Westwyns
desire to see Miss Tyrold.”</P>
<P>Camilla did not wish to avoid persons to whom she
was so much obliged, but begged she might receive
them in the next apartment, that Mrs. Berlinton might
not be disturbed.</P>
<P>The eager old gentleman stood with the door in
one hand, and his son in the other, awaiting her.
“My dear young lady,” he cried, “I have been
hunting you out for hours. Your good governess had
not a mind to give me your direction, thinking me, I
suppose, but a troublesome old fellow; and I did not
know which way to turn, till Hal found it out. Hal's
<PB N="47" REF="48"/>
pretty quick. So now, my dear young lady, let me
tell you my errand; which I won't be tedious in, for
fear, another time, you may rather not see me. And
the more I see you, the less I like to think such
a thing. However, with all my good will to
make haste, I must premise one thing, as it is but
fair. Hal was quite against my coming upon this
business. But I don't think it the less right for that;
and so I come. I never yet saw any good of a man's
being ruled by his children. It only serves to make
them think their old fathers superannuated. And if
once I find Hal taking such a thing as that into his
head, I'll cut him of with a shilling, well as I love
him.”</P>
<P>“Your menace, sir,” said Henry, colouring, though
smiling, “gives me no alarm, for I see no danger.
But—shall we not detain Miss Tyrold too long from
her friends?”</P>
<P>“Ay now, there comes in what I take notice to be
the taste of the present day! a lad can hardly enter
his teens, before he thinks himself wiser than his father,
and gives him his counsel, and tells him what he
thinks best. And, if a man i'n't upon his guard, he
may be run down for an old dotard, before he knows
where he is, and see his son setting up for a member
of parliament, making laws for him. Now this is
what I don't like; so I keep a tight hand upon Hal,
that he mayn't do it. For Hal's but a boy, ma'am,
though he's so clever. Not that I pretend I'd change
him neither, for e'er an old fellow in the three king∣doms.
Well, but, now I'll you what I come for.
You know how angry I was about Hal's turning that
man out of the room? well, I took all the pains I
could to come at the bottom of the fray, intending, all
the time, to make Hal ask the man's pardon; and
now what do you think is the end? Why, I've
found out Hal to be in the right! The man proves to
be a worthless fellow, that has defamed the niece of
my dear Sir Hugh Tyrold; and if Hal had lashed him
with a cat-o'nine-tails, I should have been glad of it.
I can't say I should have found fault. So you see,
<PB N="48" REF="49"/>
my dear young lady, I was but a cross old fellow, to
be so out of sorts with poor Hal.”</P>
<P>Camilla, with mingled gratitude and shame, of∣fered
her acknowledgements; though what she heard
astonished, if possible, even more than it mortified her.
How in the world, thought she, can I have provoked
this slander?</P>
<P>She knew not how little provocation is necessary for
calumny; nor how regularly the common herd,
where appearances admit two interpretations, decide
for the worst. Girt designed her neither evil nor good;
but not knowing who or what she was, simply filled
up the doubts in his own mind, by the bias of his own
character.</P>
<P>Confused as much as herself, Henry proposed imme∣diately
to retire; and, as Camilla did not invite them
to stay, Mr. Westwyn could not refuse his consent:
though, sending his son out first, he stopt to say,
in a low voice, “What do you think of Hal, my dear
young lady? I'n't he a brave rogue? And did not
you tell me I might be proud of my son? And so I
am, I promise you! How do you think my old
friend will like Hal? I shall take him to Cleves.
He's another sort of lad to Master Clermont! I
hope, my dear young lady, you don't like your cousin?
He's but a sad spark, I give you my word. Not a bit
like Hal.”</P>
<P>When the carriage came for Eugenia, who was self∣persuaded
this day was the most felicitous of her life,
she went so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>luctantly, that Mrs. Berlinton, caught
by her delight in the visit, though unsuspicious of its
motive, invited her to renew it the next morning.</P>
<P>At night, Mrs. Mittin, following Camilla to her
chamber, said, “See here, my dear! what do you
say to this? Did you ever see a prettier cloak? look
at the cut of it, look at the capes! look at the mode!
And as for the lace, I don't think all Southampton can
produce its fellow; what do you say to it, my dear?”</P>
<P>“What every body must say to it, Mrs. Mittin;
that it's remarkably pretty.”</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50"/>
“Well, now try it on. There's a set! there's a
fall off the shoulders! do but look at it in the glass.
I'd really give something you could but see how it be∣comes
you Now, do pray, only tell me what you
think of it?”</P>
<P>“Always the same, Mrs. Mittin; that it's ex∣tremely
pretty.”</P>
<P>“Well, my dear, then, now comes out the se∣cret!
It's your own! you may well stare; but it's
true; it's your own, my dear!”</P>
<P>She demanded an explanation; and Mrs. Mittin said,
that, having taken notice that her cloak looked very
mean by the side of Mrs. Berlinton's, when she com∣pared
them together, she resolved upon surprising her
with a new one as quick as possible. She had, there∣fore,
got the pattern of Mrs. Berlinton's and cut it
out, and then got the mode at an haberdasher's, and
then the lace at a milliner's, and then set to work so
hard, that she had got it done already.</P>
<P>Camilla, seeing the materials were all infinitely
richer than any she had been accustomed to wear, was
extremely chagrined by such officiousness, and gravely
inquired how much this would add to her debts.</P>
<P>“I don't know yet, my dear; but I had all the
things as cheap as possible; but as it was not all at
one shop, I can't be clear as to the exact sum.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who had determined to avoid even the
shadow of a debt, and to forbear every possible expence
till she had not one remaining, was now not merely
vexed, but angry. Mrs. Mittin, however, upon whose
feelings that most troublesome of all qualities to its
possessors, delicacy, never obtruded, went on, extoll∣ing
her own performance, and praising her own good
nature, without discovering that either were imperti∣nent;
and, was so far from conceiving it possible they
could be unwelcome, that she attributed the concern
of Camilla to modesty, on account of her trouble;
and mistook her displeasure for distress, what she could
do for her in return. And, indeed, when she finished
her double panegyric upon the cloak and its maker,
with confessing she had sat up the whole night, in
<PB N="50" REF="51"/>
order to get it done, Camilla considered herself as too
much obliged to her intention to reproach any further
its want of judgment; and concluded by merely in∣treating
she would change her note, pay for it imme∣diately,
discharge her other accounts with all speed,
and make no future purchase for her whatsoever.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Scuffle.</HEAD>
<P>EUGENIA failed not to observe her appointment
the next morning, which was devoted to elegiac
poetry. A taste so similar operated imperceptibly upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Berlinton, who detained her till she was com∣pelled
to return to prepare for a great hall at the pub∣lic
rooms; the profound deliberations of Miss Marg∣land,
how to exhibit her fair pupil, having finished,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most deliberations upon such subjects, by doing
that which is done by every body else upon the same
occasion.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had given directions to Miss Margland to
clear his three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eces equally of all expences relative
to public places. Camilla, therefore, being entitled
to a ticker, and having brought with her whatever
was unspoilt of her Tunbridge apparel, thought this
the most seasonable opportunity she could take for
again seeing Edgar, who, in their present delicate
situation, would no longer, probably, think it right to
inquire for her at a stranger's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton had not purposed appearing in pub∣lic,
till she had formed her own party; but an irre∣pressible
curiosity to see Indiana induced her to accom∣pany
Camilla, with no other attendant than Lord
Valhurst.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin sought vainly to be of the party; Mrs.
Berlinton, though permitting her stay in her house,
<PB N="51" REF="52"/>
and treating her with constant civility, had no idea
of including her in her own society, which she aimed
to have always distinguished by either rank, talents,
or admirers: and Camilla, who now felt her integrity
involved in her economy, was firm against every hint
for assisting her with a ticket.</P>
<P>Lord Valhurst, who alone, of the fashionable so∣journers,
had yet discovered the arrival of Mrs. Ber∣linton,
was highly gratified by this opportunity of
attending two such fair creatures in public.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, as usual, was the last to enter the
room; for she never began the duties of the toilette
till after tea-time. Two such youthful beauties were
not likely to pass without observation. Mrs. Berlin∣ton,
already no longer new to it, had alternately the
air of receiving it with the most winning modesty, or
of not noticing she received it at all: for though, but
a few months since, she had scarcely been even see<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by twenty persons, and even of those had never met a
fixed eye without a blush, the feelings are so often the
mere concomitants of the habits, that she could now
already know herself the principal object of a whole
assembly, without any sensation of timidity, or ap∣pearance
of confusion. To be hold was not in her
nature, which was soft and amiable; but admiration
is a dangerous assaulter of diffidence, and familiarity
makes almost any distinction met unmoved.</P>
<P>Camilla was too completely engrossed by her heart,
to think of her appearance.</P>
<P>Lord Valhurst, from his time of life, seemed to be
their father, though his adulating air as little suited
that character as his inclination. He scarce knew
upon which most to lavish his compliments, or to
regale his eyes, and turned, half expiring with extasy,
from the soft charms of his kinswoman, with some∣thing,
he thought, resembling animation, to the more
quickening influence of her bright-eyed companion.</P>
<P>But the effect produced upon the company at large
by the radiant beauty of Indiana, who had entered
some time, was still more striking than any immediate
powers from all the bewitching graces of Mrs. Ber∣linton,
<PB N="52" REF="53"/>
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d all the intelligent loveliness of Camilla.
Her faultless face, her perfect form, raised wonder in
one sex, and overpowered envy in the other. The
men looked at her, as at something almost too celestial
for their devoirs; the women, even the most charming
amongst them, saw themselves distanced from all pre∣tensions
to rivalry. She was followed, but not ap∣proached;
gazed at, as if a statue, and inquired
after, rather as a prodigy than a mortal.</P>
<P>This awful homage spread not, however, to her
party; the watchful but disdainful eyes of Miss
Margland obtained for herself, even with usury, all
the haughty contempt they bestowed upon others:
Eugenia was pronounced to be a foil, brought merely
in ridicule: and Dr. Orkborne, whom Miss Margland,
though detesting, forced into the set, in preference to
being without a man, to band them from the carriage,
and to call it for them at night, had a look so forlorn
and distressed, while obliged to parade with them up
and down the room, that he seemed rather a prisoner
than an esquire, and more to require a guardian to
prevent his escaping himself, than to serve for one in
securing his young charges from any attack.</P>
<P>Miss Margland augured nothing short of half a
score proposals of marriage the next day, from the
evident brilliancy of this first opening into life of her
beautiful pupil; whose own eyes, while they dazzled
all others, sought eagerly those of Melmond, which
they meant to vanquish, if not annihilate.</P>
<P>The first care of Miss Margland was to make herself
and her young ladies known to the master of the cere∣monies.
Indiana needed not that precaution to be im∣mediately
the choice of the most elegant man in the
room; yet she was piqued, not delighted, and Miss
Margland felt still more irritated, that he proved to
be only a baronet, though a obleman, at the same
time, had presented himself to Eugenia. It is true
the poet was ruined; but his title was unimpaired;
and though the fortune of the baronet, like his person,
was in its pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, Indiana thought herself degraded by
<PB N="53" REF="54"/>
his hand, since the partner of her cousin was of supe∣rior
rank.</P>
<P>Eugenia, insensible to this honour, looked only for
Melmond; not like Indiana, splendidly to see and
kill, but silently to view and venerate. Melmond,
however, was not there; he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w his little command
over his passion, in presence of its object; he knew,
too, that the expence of public places was now beyond
the propriety of his income, and virtuously devoted
his ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning to his sick aunt.</P>
<P>Edgar had waited impatiently the entrance of Ca∣milla.
His momentary sight of L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd Valhurst, at the
bathing room, did not bring him to his remembrance
in his present more sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wy apparel, and he was gra∣tified
to see only an old <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in her immediate suite.
He did not deem it proper, as they were now cir∣cumstanced,
to ask her to dance; but he quietly ap∣proached
and bowed to her, and addressed some civil
inquiries to Mrs. Berlinton. The Westwyns had
waited for her at the door; and the father had imme∣diately
made her give her hand to Henry to join the
dancers.</P>
<P>“That's a charming girl,” cried old Mr. Westwyn,
when she was gone; “a very charming girl, I pro∣mise
you. I have taken a prodigious liking to her;
and so has Hal.”</P>
<P>Revived by this open speech, which made him hope
there was no serious design, Edgar smiled upon the
old gentleman, who had addressed it to the whole
remaining party; and said, “You have not known
that young lady long, I believe, sir?”</P>
<P>“No, sir; but a little while; but that I don't
mind. A long while and a short while is all one,
when I like a person; for I don't think how many
years they've got over their heads since first I saw
them, but how many good things they've got on the
inside their hearts to make me want to see them
again. Her uncle's the dearest friend I have in the
world; and when I go from this place, I shall make
him a visit; for I'm sure of a welcome. But he has
never seen my Hal. However, that good girl will
<PB N="54" REF="55"/>
he sure to speak a kind word for him, I know; for
she thinks very well of him; she told me herself, I
might be proud of my son. I can't say but I've loved
the girl ever since for it.”</P>
<P>Edgar was so much pleased with the perfectly na∣tural
character of this old gentleman, that, though
alarmed at his intended call upon the favour of Sir Hugh,
through the influence of Camilla, for Henry, he would
yet have remained in his society, had he not been
driven from it by the junction of young Lynmere,
whose shallow insolence he thought insupportable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who declined dancing, had arrived
so late, that when Henry led back Camilla, the com∣pany
was summoned to the tea-table. She was lan∣guishing
for an introduction to Indiana, the absence
of Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mond obviating all present objection to their
meeting; she therefore gave Camilla the welcome task
to propose that the two parties should unite.</P>
<P>Many years had elapsed since Miss Margland had
received so sensible a gratification; and, in the coa∣lition
which took place, she displayed more of civility
in a few minutes, than she had exerted during the whole
period of her Yorkshire and Cleves residence.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all she had heard of her charms,
Mrs. Berlinton still saw with surprise and admiration
the exquisite face and form of the chosen of her
brother, whom she now so sincerely bewailed, that, had
her own wealth been personal or transferrable, she
would not have hesitated in sharing it with him, to aid
his better success.</P>
<P>Lord Valhurst adhered tenaciously to his kins∣woman;
and the three gentlemen who had danced the
last dances with Indiana, Eugenia, and Camilla,
assetted the privilege of attending their partners at the
tea-table.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Lynmere, coming up to them,
with “Well, have you got any thing here one can
touch?” leant his hand on the edge, and his whole
body over the table, to take a view at his ease of its
contents.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56"/>
“Suppose there were nothing, sir?” said old
Westwyn; “look round, and see what you could
want.”</P>
<P>“Really, sir,” said Miss Margland, between whom
and Camilla, Lynmere had squeezed himself a place,
“you don't use much ceremony!”</P>
<P>Having taken some tea, he found it intolerable,
and said he must have a glass of Champaign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>“La, brother!” cried Indiana, “if you bring
any win<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I can't bear to stay.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland said the same; but he whistled, and
looked rou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him without answering.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who, though she had thought his
uncommonly fine person an excuse for his intrusion,
thought nothing could excuse this ill-breeding, pro∣posed
they should leave the tea-table, and walk.</P>
<P>“Sit still, ladies,” said Mr. Westwyn, “and
drink your tea in peace.” Then, turning to Lynmere,
“I wonder,” he cried, “you an't ashamed of your∣self!
If you were a son of mine, I'll tell you what;
I'd lock you up! I'd serve you as I did when I car∣ried
you over to Leipsic, eight years ago. I always
hated pert boys. I can't fancy 'em.”</P>
<P>Lynmere, affecting not to hear him, though in∣wardly
firing, called violently after a waiter; and,
in mere futile vengeance, not only gave in order for
Champaigne, but demanded some Stilton cheese.”</P>
<P>“Cheese!” exclaimed Miss Margland, “if you
order any cheese. I can't so much as stay in the
room. Think what a nauseous smell it will make<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>”</P>
<P>The man answered they had no Stilton cheese in the
house, but the very best of every other sort.</P>
<P>Lynmere, who had only given this command to
shew his defiance of control, seized, with equal a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣dity,
the opportunity to abuse the waiter; affirming
he belonged to the worst served hotel in Christendom.</P>
<P>The man walked off in dudgeon, and Mr.
Westwyn, losing his anger in his astonishment at this
effrontery, said, “And pray, Mr. Lynmere, what
do you pretend to know of Stilton cheese? do they
make it at Leipsie? did you ever so much as taste it
in your life?”</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57"/>
“O, yes! excellent! excellentissimo! I can eat
no other.”</P>
<P>“Eat no other! it's well my Hal don't say the
same! I'd churn him to a cheese himself if he did!
And pray Mr. Lynmere, he so good as to let me
know how you got it there?”</P>
<P>“Ways and means, sir; ways and means!”</P>
<P>“Why you did not send across the sea for it?”</P>
<P>“A travelled man, sir, thinks no more of what
you call across the sea, than you, that live always
over your own fire-side, think of stepping across a
kennel.”</P>
<P>“Well, sir, well,” said the old gentleman, now
very much piqued,! “I can't but say I feel some con∣cern
for my old friend, to have his money doused about
at such a rantipole rate. A boy to be sending over
out of Germany into England for Stilton cheese! I
wish it had been Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with all my heart! I promise
you I'd have given him enough of it. If the least
little thought of the kind was but once to have got in
his head, I'd have taken my b st oaken stick, and
have done him the good office to have helped it out
for him: and have made him thank me after too!
I hate daintiness; especially in boys. I have no great
patience with it.”</P>
<P>Only more incensed, Lynmere called aloud for his
Champaigne. The waiter civilly told him, it was
not usual to bring wine during tea: but he p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsisted;
and Mr. Westywn, who saw the ladies all rising, au∣thoritatively,
told the waiter to mind no such direc∣tions.
Lynmere, who had entered the ball-room in
his riding-dress, raised a switch at the man, which he
durst not raise at Mr. Westwyn, and protested, in a
threatening attitude, he would lay it across his shoul∣ders,
if he obeyed not. The man, justly provoked,
thought himself authorised to snatch it from him:
Clerm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t resisted; a fierce scuffle ensued; and though
Henry, by immediate intervention, could have parted
them, Mr. Westywn insisted there should he no inter∣ference,
saying, “If any body's helped, let it be the
waiter; for he's here to do his duty: he don't come
<PB N="57" REF="58"/>
only to behave unmannerly, for his own pleasure.
And if I see him hard run, it's odds but I lend him
my own fist to right him.—I like fair play.”</P>
<P>The female party, in very serious alarm at this un∣pleasant
scene, rose to hurry away. Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alhurst
was ambitious to suffice as guardian to both his fair
charges; but Henry, when prohibited from stopping
the affray, offered his services to Camilla, who could
not refuse them; and Mrs. Berlinton, active and im∣patient,
flew on foremost; with more speed than his
lordship could follow, or even keep in fight. Indiana
was handed out by her new adorer, the young baro∣net;
and Eugenia was assisted by her new assailer, the
young nobleman.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had hurried to Camilla at the first tu∣mult,
was stung to the heart to see who handed her
away; and, forcing a passage, followed, till Henry,
the envied Henry, deposited her in the carriage of
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>The confusion in the room, meanwhile, was not
likely soon to decrease, for old Mr. Westwyn, de∣lighted
by this mortifying chastisement to Clermont,
would permit neither mediation nor assistance on his
side; saying, with great glee, “It will do him a
great deal of good! My poor old friend will bless
me for it. This is a better lesson than he got in all
Leipsic. Let him feel that a Man's a Man; and not
take it into his head a person's to stand still to be
switched, when he's doing his duty, according to his
calling. Switching a man is a bad thing. I can't say
I like it. A gentleman should always use good words;
and then a poor man's proud to serve him; or, if he's
insolent for nothing, he may trounce him and wel∣come.
I've no objection.”</P>
<P>Miss Margland, meanwhile, had not been remiss in
what she esteemed a most capital feminine accomplish∣ment,
screaning; though, in its exercise, she had
failed of any success, since, while her voice called
remark, her countenance repelled its effect. Yet as
she saw that not one lady of the group retreated un∣attended,
she thought it a disgrace to seem the only
<PB N="58" REF="59"/>
female, who, from internal courage, or external ne∣glect,
should retire alone; she therefore called upon
Dr. Orkborne, conjuring, in a shrill and pathetic
voice, meant more for all who surrounded than for
himself, that he would protect her.</P>
<P>The Doctor, who had kept his place in defiance of
all sort of inconvenience, either to himself or to
others; and who, with some curiosity, was viewing
the combat, which he was mentally comparing with
certain pugilistic games of old, was now, for the first
time in the evening, receiving some little entertainment,
and therefore composedly answered, “I have a very
good place here, ma'am; and I would rather not quit
it till this scene is over.”</P>
<P>“So you won't come, then, Doctor?” cried she,
modulating into a soft whine the voice which rage,
not terror, rendered tremulous.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who was any thing rather than lo∣quacious,
having given one answer, said no more.</P>
<P>Miss Margland appealed to all present upon the
indecorum of a lady's being kept to witness such un∣becoming
violence, and upon the unheard-of inatten∣tion
of the Doctor: but a short, “Certainly!—”
“To be sure, ma'am!—” or, “It's very shocking
indeed!” with a hasty decampment from her neigh∣bourhood,
was all of sympathy she procured.</P>
<P>The entrance, at length, of the master of the
house, stopt the affray, by calling off the waiter.
Clermont, then, though wishing to extirpate old
Westwyn from the earth, and ready to eat his own
flesh with fury at the double disgrace he had endured,
affected a loud halloo, as if he had been contending
for his amusement; and protesting Bob, the waiter,
was a fine fellow, went off with great apparent satis∣faction.</P>
<P>“Now, then, at least, sir,” cried Miss Margland,
imperiously to the Doctor, who, still ruminating upon
the late contest, kept his seat, “I suppose you'll
condescend to take care of me to the coach?”</P>
<P>“These modern clothes are very much in the
way,” said the Doctor, gravely; “and give a bad
<PB N="59" REF="60"/>
effect to attitudes.” He rose, however, but not
knowing what <HI>to take care of a lady to a coach</HI> meant,
stood resolutely still, till she was forced, in despera∣tion,
to walk on alone. He then slowly followed,
keeping many paces behind, notwithstanding her con∣tinually
looking back; and when, with a heavy sigh
at her hard fate, she got, unassisted, into the carriage,
where her young ladies were waiting, he tranquilly
mounted after her, tolerably reconciled to the loss of
his evening, by some new annotations it had suggested
for his work, relative to the games of antiquity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Youthful Effusion.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA now thought herself safe in harbour;
the storms all over, the dangers all past, and but
a light gale or two wanting to make good her landing
on the bosom of permanent repose. This gale, this
propitious gale, she thought ready to blow at her cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:
for she deemed it no other than the breath of jealousy.
She had seen Edgar, though he knew her to be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected,
follow her to the coach, and she had seen, by
the light afforded from the lamps of the carriage, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
her safety from the crowd and tumult was not the sole
object of his watchfulness, since though that, at the
instant she turned round, was obviously secure, his
countenance exhibited the strongest marks of distur∣bance.
The secret spring, therefore, she now thought,
that was to re-unite them, was in her own possession</P>
<P>All the counsels of Mrs. Arlbery upon this subject
occurred to her; and imagining she had hitherto erred
from a simple facility, she rejoiced in the accident
which had pointed her to a safer path, and shewn her
that, in the present disordered state of the opinions of
<PB N="60" REF="61"/>
Edgar, the only way to a lasting accommodation was
to alarm his security, by asserting her own independ∣ence.</P>
<P>Her difficulty, however, was still considerable as to
the means. The severe punishment she had received,
and the self blame and penitence she had incurred,
from her experiment with Sir Sedley Clarendel, all
rendered, too, abortive, by Edgar's contempt of the
object, determined her to suffer no hopes, no feelings
of her own, to engross her ever more from weighing
those of another. The end, therefore, of her deli∣beration
was to shew general gaiety, without appro∣priate
favour, and to renew solicitude on his part by
a displayed ease of mind on her own.</P>
<P>Elated with this idea she determined upon every
possible public exhibition by which she could execute
it to the best advantage. Mrs. Berlinton had but to
appear, to secure the most fashionable persons at
Southampton for her parties, and soon renewed the
same course of life she had lived at Tunbridge, of
seeing company either at home or abroad every day,
except when some accidental plan offered a scheme of
more novelty.</P>
<P>Upon all these occasions, young Westwyn, though
wholly unsought, and even unthought of by Camilla,
was instinctively and incautiously the most alert to
second her plan; he was her first partner when she
danced, her constant attendant when she walked, and
always in wait to converse with her when she was
seated; while, not purposing to engage him, she per∣ceived
not his fast growing regard, and intending to
be open to all alike, observed not the thwarting effect
to her design of this peculiar assiduity.</P>
<P>By old Mr. Westwyn this intercourse was yet more
urgently forwarded. Bewitched with Camilla, he
carried his son to her wherever she appeared, and said
aloud to every body but herself: “If the boy and
girl like one another, they shall have one another;
and I won't inquire what she's worth; for she thinks so
well of my son, that I'd rather he'd have her than
an empress. Money goes but a little way to make
<PB N="61" REF="62"/>
people happy; and true love's not a thing to be got
every day; so if she has a mind to my Hal, and Hal
has a mind to her, why, if they have not enough,
he must work hard and get more. I don't like to cross
young peop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Better let a man labour with his hands,
than fret away his spirit. Neither a boy nor a girl are
good for much when they've got their hearts broke.”</P>
<P>This new experiment of Camilla, like every other
deduced from false reasoning, and formed upon false
principles, was flattering in its promise, pernicious in
its progress, and abortive in its performance. Edgar
saw with agony what he conceived the ascendance of
a new attachment built upon the declension of all
regard for himself; and in the first horror of his appre∣hensions,
would have resisted the supplanter by en∣forcing
his own final claim; but Dr. Marchmont
represented that, since he had heard in silence his right
to that claim solemnly withdrawn, he had better first
ascertain if this apparent connection with young
Westwyn were the motive, or only the consequence
of that resumption: “If the first be the case,” he
added, “you must trust her no more: a heart so in∣flammable
as to be kindled into passion by a mere acci∣dental
blaze of gallantry and valour, can have nothing
in consonance with the chaste purity and fidelity your
character requires and merits: If the last, investigate
whether the net in which she is entangling herself is
that of levity, delighting in change, or of pique, dis∣guising
its own agitation in efforts to agitate others.”</P>
<P>“Alas!” cried the melancholy Edgar, “in either
case, she is no more the artless Camilla I first adored!
that fatal connection at the Grove, formed while her
character, pure, white, and spotless, was in its en∣chanting,
but dangerous state of first ductility, has
already broken into that clear transparent singleness of
mind, so beautiful in its total ignorance of every spe∣cies
of scheme, every sort of double measure, every
idea of secret view and latent expedient!”</P>
<P>“Repine not, however, at the connection till you
know whether she owes to it her defects, or only their
manifestation. A man should see the woman he would
<PB N="62" REF="63"/>
marry in many situations, ere he can judge what chance
he may have of happiness with her in any. Though
now and then 'tis a blessed, 'tis always a perilous state;
but the man who has to weather its storms, should
not be remiss in studying the clouds which precede
them.”</P>
<P>“Ah, Doctor! by this delay—by these experi∣ments—should
I lose her!—”</P>
<P>“If by finding her unworthy, where is the loss?”</P>
<P>Edgar sighed, but acknowledged this question to be
unanswerable.</P>
<P>“Think, my dear young friend, what would be
your sufferings to discover any radical, inherent fail∣ing,
when irrem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diably her's! run not into the very
common error of depending upon the gratitude of
your wife after marriage, for the in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quality of her
fortune before your union. She who has no fortune
at all, owes you no more for your alliance, than she
who has thousands; for you do not marry her because
she has no fortune! you marry her because you think
she has some endowment, mental or personal, which
you conclude will conduce to your happiness; and
she, on her part, accepts you, because she supposes
you or your situation will contribute to her's The
object may be different, but neither side is indebted to
the other, since each has self, only, in contempla∣tion;
and thus, in fact, rich or poor, high or low,
whatever be the previous distinction between the par∣ties,
on the hour of marriage they begin as equals.
The obligation and the debt of gratitude can only
commence when the knot is tied: self, then, may
give way to sympathy; and whichever, from that
moment, most considers the other, becomes immedi∣ately
the creditor in the great account of life and
happiness.”</P>
<P>While Camilla, in gay ignorance of danger, and
awake only to hope, pursued her new course, Euge∣nia
had the infinite delight of improving daily and
even hourly in the good graces of Mrs. Berlinton;
<PB N="63" REF="64"/>
who soon discovered how wide from justice to that
excellent young creature was all judgment that
could be formed from her appearance. She found
that she was as elegant in her taste for letters as
herself, and far more deeply cultivated in their
knowledge; that her manners were gentle, her sen∣timents
were elevated, yet that her mind was hum∣ble;
the same authors delighted and the same passa∣ges
struck them; they met every morning; they
thought every morning too short, and their friend∣ship,
in a very few days, knit by so many bands of
sympathy, was as fully established as that which al∣ready
Mrs. Berlinton had formed with Camilla.</P>
<P>To Eugenia this treaty of amity was a delicious
poison, which, while it enchanted her faculties by
day, preyed upon her vitals by night. She fre∣quently
saw Melmond, and though a melancholy
bow was almost all the notice she ever obtained
from him, the countenance with which he made it,
his air, his figure, his face, nay his very dress, for
the half instant he bestowed upon her, occupied
all her thoughts till she saw him again, and had
another to con over and dwell upon.</P>
<P>Melmond, inexpressibly wretched at the depriva∣tion
of all hope of Indiana, at the very period when
fortune seemed to favour his again pursuing her,
dreamt not of this partiality. His time was devoted
to deliberating upon some lucrative scheme of fu∣ture
life, which his literary turn of mind rendered
difficult of selection, and which his refined love of
study and retirement made hateful to him to un∣dertake.</P>
<P>He was kind, however, and even consoling to
his aunt, who saw his nearly desolate state with a
compunction bitterly increased by finding she had
thrown their joint properties, with her own per∣son,
into the hands of a rapacious tyrant. To
soften her repentance, and allow her the soothing
of all she could spare of her own time, Mrs. Ber∣linton
invited her to her own house. Mr. Ulst, of
course included in the invitation, made the removal
<PB N="64" REF="65"/>
with alacrity, not for the pleasure it procured his
wife, but for the money it saved himself; and Mrs.
Mittin voluntarily resigned to them the apartment
she had chosen for her own, by way of a little peace-offering
for her undesired length of stay; for still,
though incessantly Camilla inquired for her ac∣count,
she had received no answer from her credi∣tors,
and was obliged to wait for another and ano∣ther
post.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ulst, though not well enough, at present,
to see company, and at all times, fanatically averse
to every species of recreation, could not entirely
avoid Eugenia, whose visits were constant every
morning, and whose expected inheritance made a
similar wish occur for her nephew, with that which
had disposed of her niece; for she flattered herself
that if once she could see them both in possession
of great wealth, her mind would be more at ease.</P>
<P>She communicated this idea to Mr. Ulst, who,
most willing, also, to get rid of the reproach of the
poverty and ruin of Melmond, imparted it with
strong exhortation for its promotion, to the young
man; but he heard with disdain the mercenary
project, and protested he would daily labour for
his bread, in preference to prostituting his probity,
by soliciting a regard he could never return, for
the acquirement of a fortune which he never
could merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Ulst, much too hard to feel this as any re∣flection
upon himself, applied for the interest of
Mrs. Berlinton; but she so completely thought
with her brother, that she would not interfere,
till Mr. Ulst made some observations upon Eugenia
herself, that inclined her to waver.</P>
<P>He soon remarked, in that young and artless
character, the symptoms of the partiality she had
conceived in favour of Melmond, which, when
once pointed out, could not be mistaken by Mrs.
Berlinton, who, though more than equally suscep∣tible
with Eugenia, was self-occupied, and saw nei∣ther
her emotion at his name, nor her timid air at
<PB N="65" REF="66"/>
his approach, till Mr. Ulst, whose discernment had
been quickened by his wishes, told her when, and
for what, to look.</P>
<P>Touched now, herself, by the double happiness
that might ensue, from a gratified choice to Euge∣nia,
and a noble fortune to her brother, she took
up the cause, with delicacy, yet with pity; repre∣senting
all the charming mental and intellectual
accomplishments of Eugenia, and beseeching him
not to sacrifice both his interest and his peace, in
submitting to a hopeless passion for one object,
while he inflicted all its horrors upon another.</P>
<P>Melmond, amazed and softened, listened and
sighed; but protested such a change, from all of
beauty to all of deformity, was impracticable; and
that though he revered the character she painted,
and was sensible to the honour of such a preference,
he must be base, double, and perjured, to take ad∣vantage
of her great, yet unaccountable goodness,
by heartless professions of feigned participation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, to whom sentiment was irresist∣able,
urged the matter no longer, but wept over
her brother, with compassionate admiration.</P>
<P>Another day only passed, when Mrs Mittin
picked up a paper upon the stairs, which she saw
fall from the pocket of Eugenia, in drawing out her
handkerchief, but which, determined to read ere she
returned, she found contained these lines.</P>
<P>O Reason! friend of the troubled breast guide
of the wayward fancy, moderator of the flights
of hope, and sinkings of despair, Eugenia calls
thee!</P>
<LG>
<L>“O! to a feeble, suppliant Maid,</L>
<L>“Light of Reason, lend thy aid!</L>
<L>“And with thy mild, thy lucid ray,</L>
<L>“Point her the way</L>
<L>“To genial calm and mental joy!</L>
<L>“From Passion far! whose flashes bright</L>
<L>“Startle—affright—</L>
<L>“Yet ah! invite!</L>
<PB N="66" REF="67"/>
<L>“With varying powers, attract, repel,</L>
<L>“Now fiercely beam,</L>
<L>“Now softly gleam,</L>
<L>“With magic spell</L>
<L>“Charm to consume, win to destroy!</L>
<L>“Ah! lead her from the chequer'd glare</L>
<L>“So false, so fair!—</L>
<L>“Ah, quick from Passion bid her fly,</L>
<L>“Its sway repulse, its wiles defy;</L>
<L>“And to a feeble, suppliant heart</L>
<L>“Thy aid, O Reason's light, impart!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>“Next, Eugenia, point thy prayer</L>
<L>“That He whom all thy wishes bless,</L>
<L>“Whom all thy tenderest thoughts confess,</L>
<L>“Thy calm may prove, thy peace may share.</L>
<L>“O, if the griefs to him assign'd,</L>
<L>“To thee might pass—thy strengthened mind</L>
<L>“Would meet all woe, support all pain,</L>
<L>“Suffering despise, complaint disdain,</L>
<L>“Brac'd with new nerves each ill would brave,</L>
<L>“From Melmond but one pang to save!”</L>
</LG>
<P>Overjoyed by the possession of the important
secret this little juvenile effusion of tenderness be∣trayed,
Mrs. Mittin ran with it to Mrs Berlinton,
and without mentioning she had seen whence the
paper came, said she had found it upon the stairs:
for even those who have too little delicacy to attri∣bute
to treachery a clandestine indulgence of curi∣osity,
have a certain instinctive sense of its unfair∣ness,
which they evince without avowing, by the
care with which they soften their motives, or
their manner, of according themselves this species
of gratification.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who scrupulously would have
withheld from looking into a letter, could not see
a copy of verses, and recognize the hand of Euge∣nia,
already known to her by frequent notes, and
refrain reading. That she should find any thing
personal, did not occur to her; to peruse, there∣fore,
<PB N="67" REF="68"/>
a manuscript ode or sonnet, which the humi∣lity
of Eugenia might never voluntarily reveal,
caused her no hesitation; and she ran through the
lines with the warmest delight, till, coming sud∣denly
upon the end, she burst into tears, and flew
to the apartment of her brother.</P>
<P>She put the paper into his hand without a word,
He read it hastily. Surprised, confounded, dis∣ordered,
he looked at his sister for some explana∣tion
or comment; she was still silently in tears;
he read it again, and with yet greater emotion;
when, holding it back to her, “Why, my sister,”
he cried, “why would she give you this? why
would you deliver it? Ah! leave me, in pity, firm
in integrity, though fallen in fortune.!”</P>
<P>“My brother, my dear brother, this matchless
creature merits not so degrading an idea; she gave
me not the precious paper—she knows not I pos∣sess
it; it was found upon the stairs: Ah! far from
thus openly confessing her unhappy prepossession,
she conceals it from every human being; even her
beloved sister, I am convinced, is untrusted; upon
paper only she has breathed it, and breathed it as
you see—with a generosity of soul that is equal to
the delicacy of her conduct.”</P>
<P>Melmond now felt subdued. To have excited
such a regard in a mind that seemed so highly cul∣tivated,
and so naturally elegant, could not sail to
to touch him; and the concluding line deeply pe∣netrated
him with tender though melancholy grati∣tude.
He took the hand of his sister, returned her
the paper, and was going to say: “Do whatever
you think proper;” but the idea of losing all right
to adore Indiana checked and silenced him; and
mournfully telling her he required a little time for
reflection, he entreated to be left to himself.</P>
<P>He was not suffered to ruminate in quiet; Mrs.
Mittin, proud of having anything to communicate
to a relation of Mrs. Berlinton's, made an oppor∣tunity
to sit with Mrs. Ulst, purposely to commu∣nicate
to her the discovery that Miss Eugenia
<PB N="68" REF="69"/>
Tyrold was in love with, and wrote verses upon,
her nephew. Melmond was instantly sent for; the
important secret was enlarged upon with remon∣strances
so pathetic, not to throw away such an
invitation to the most brilliant good fortune, in
order to cast himself, with his vainly nourished
passion, upon immediate hardships, or lasting penu∣ry;
that reason as well as interest, compelled him
to listen; and, after a severe conflict, he gave his
reluctant promise to see Eugenia upon her next
visit, and endeavour to bias his mind to the con∣nexion
that seemed likely to ensue.</P>
<P>Camilla who was in total ignorance of the whole
of this business, received, during the dinner, an in∣coherent
note from her sister, conjuring that she
would search immediately, but privately, in her
own chamber, in the dressing-room of Mrs. Berlin∣ton,
in the hall, and upon the stairs, for a paper
in her hand-writing, which she had somewhere
lost, but which she besought her, by all that she
held dear, not to read when she found; protesting
she should shut herself up for ever from the whole
world, if a syllable of what she had written on
that paper were read by a human being.</P>
<P>Camilla could not endure to keep her sister a
moment in this suspensive state, and made an ex∣cuse
for quitting the table that she might instantly
seek the manuscript. Melmond and Mrs. Berlin∣ton
both conjectured the contents of the billet,
and felt much for the modest and timid Eugenia;
but Mrs. Mittin could not confine herself to silent
suggestion; she rose also, and running after Ca∣milla,
said: “My dear Miss, has your sister sent
to you to look for any thing?”</P>
<P>Camilla asked the meaning of her inquiry; and
she then owned she had picked up, from the
stairs, a sort of love letter, in which Miss Euge∣nia
had wrote couplets upon Mr. Melmond.</P>
<P>Inexpressibly astonished, Camilla demanded their
restoration; this soon produced a complete expla∣nation,
and while, with equal surprise and concern,
<PB N="69" REF="70"/>
she learnt the secret of Eugenia, and its discovery to
its object, she could not but respect and honour all she
she had gathered from Mrs Berlinton of the behaviour
of her brother upon the detection; and his equal free∣dom
from presumptuous vanity, or mercenary projects,
induced her to believe her sister's choice, though wholly
new to her, was well founded; and that if he could
conquer his early propensity for Indiana, he seemed,
of all the characters she knew▪ Edgar alone and always
excepted, the most peculiarly formed for the happiness
of Eugenia.</P>
<P>She begged to have the paper, and entreated her
sister might never know into whose hands it had fallen.
This was cheerfully agreed to; but Mrs. Mittin, dur∣ing
the conference, had already flown to Eugenia, and
amidst a torrent of offers of service, and professions of
power to do any thing she pleased for her, suffered her
to see that her attachment was betrayed to the whole
house.</P>
<P>The agony of Eugenia was excessive; and she re∣solved
to keep her chamber ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l she returned to Cleves,
that she might neither see nor be seen any more by
Melmond nor his family. Scarce could she bear to be
broken in upon even by Camilla, who tenderly hasten∣ed
to console her. She hid her blushing conscious
face, and protested she would inhabit only her own
apartment for the rest of her life.</P>
<P>The active Mrs. Mittin failed not to carry back the
history of this resolution; and Melmond, to his un∣speakable
regret in being thus precipitated, thought
himself called upon in all decency and propriety to an
immediate declaration. He could not, however, assume
fortitude to make it in person; nor yet was his mind
sufficiently composed for writing; he commissioned,
therefore, his sister to be the bearer of his overtures.</P>
<P>He charged her to make no mention of the verses,
which it was fitting should, on his part, pass unnoticed,
though she could not but be sensible his present address
was their consequence; he desired her simply to state
his high reverence for her virtues and talents, and his
his consciousness of the inadequacy of his pretensions
<PB N="70" REF="71"/>
to any claim upon them, except what arose from the
grateful integrity of esteem with which her happiness
should become the first object of his future life, if she
forbade not his application for the consent of Sir Hugh
and Mr. Tyrold to solicit her favour.</P>
<P>With respect to Indiana, he begged her, unless
questioned, to be wholly silent. To say his flame for
that adorable creature was extinguished would be ut∣terly
false; but his peace, as much as his honour,
would lead him to combat, henceforth, by all the
means in his power, his ill-fated and woe-teeming
passion.</P>
<P>This commission was in perfect consonance with
the feelings of Mrs. Berlinton, who, though with
difficulty the gained admission, executed it with the
most tender delicacy to the terrified Eugenia, who,
amazed and trembling, pale and incredulous, so little
understood what she heard, so little was able to believe
what she wished, that, when Mrs. Berlinton, with
an affectionate embrace, begged her answer, she asked
if it was not Indiana of whom she was speaking!</P>
<P>Mrs Berlinton then thought it right to be explicit;
she acknowledged the early passion of her brother for
that young lady, but stated that, long before he had
ventured to think of herself, he had determined its
conquest; and that what originally was the prudence
of compulsion, was now, from his altered prospects in
life, become choice: “And believe me,” added she,
from my long and complete knowledge of the honour
and the delicacy of his opinion, as well as of the ten∣derness
and gratitude of his nature, the woman who
shall once receive his vows, will find his life devoted
to the study of her happiness.”</P>
<P>Eugenia flew into her arms, hung upon her bosom,
wept, blushed, smiled, and sighed, alternately; one
moment wished Indiana in possession of her fortune,
the next thought she herself, in all but beauty, more
formed for his felicity, and ultimately gave her tacit
but transported consent to the application.</P>
<P>Melmond, upon receiving it, heaved what he fondly
hoped would be his last sigh for Indiana, and ordering
<PB N="71" REF="72"/>
his horse, set off immediately for Cleves and Ether∣ington;
determined frankly to state his small income
and crushed expectations; and feeling almost equally
indifferent to acceptance or rejection.</P>
<P>Camilla devoted the afternoon to her agitated but
enraptured sister, who desired her secret might spread
no further, till the will of her father and uncle should
decide its fate; but the loquacious Mrs. Mittin, hav∣ing
some cheap ribands and fine edgings to recommend
to Miss Margland and Indiana, could by no means
refrain from informing them, at the same time, of the
discovered manuscript.</P>
<P>“Poor thing!” cried Indiana, “I really pity her.
I don't think,” imperceptibly gliding towards the
glass; “I don't think, by what I have seen of Mr.
Melmond, she has much chance; I've a notion he's
rather more difficult.</P>
<P>“Really this is what I always expected!” said
Miss Margland; “It's just exactly what one might
look for from one of your learned educations, which
I always despised with all my heart. Writing love
verses at fifteen! Dr. Orkborne's made a fine hand
of her! I always hated him, from the very first.
However, I've had nothing to do with the bringing
her up, that's my consolation! I thank Heaven I
never made a verse in my life! and I never intend
it.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Computations of Self-Love.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA left her sister to accompany Mrs. Berlin∣ton
to the Rooms; no other mode remaining for seeing
Edgar, who, since her rejection, had held back from
repeating his attempt of visiting Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>In mutual solicitude, mutual watchfulness, and
mutual trials of each other's hearts and esteem, a week
<PB N="72" REF="73"/>
had already passed, without one hope being extirpated,
or one doubt allayed. This evening was somewhat
more, though less pleasantly decisive.</P>
<P>Accident, want of due consideration, and sudden
recollection, in an agitated moment, of the worldly
doctrine of Mrs. Arlbery, had led Camilla, once more,
into the semblance of a character, which, without
thinking of, she was acting. Born simple and ingenu∣ous,
and bred to hold in horror every species of art,
all idea of coquetry was foreign to her meaning,
though an untoward contrariety of circumstances,
playing upon feelings too potent for deliberations,
had eluded her into a conduct as mischievous in its
essects, and as wide from artlessness in its appearance,
as if she had been brought up and nourished in fashi∣onable
egotism.</P>
<P>Such, however, was not Camilla: her every pro∣pensity
was pure, and, when reflection came to her
aid, her conduct was as exemplary as her wishes.
But the ardour of her imagination, acted upon by
every passing idea, shook her judgment from its yet
unsteady seat, and left her at the mercy of wayward
Sensibility—that delicate, but irregular power, which
now impels to all that is most disinterested for others,
now forgets all mankind, to watch the pulsations of its
own fancies.</P>
<P>This evening brought her back to recollection.—Young
Westywn, urged by what he deemed encou∣ragement,
and prompted by his impatient father,
spoke of his intended visit to Cleves, and introduction
to Sir Hugh, in terms of such animated pleasure, and
with a manner of such open admiration, that she could
not mistake the serious purposes which he meant to
imply.</P>
<P>Alarmed, she looked at him; but the expression of
his eyes was not such as to still her suspicions.
Frightened <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t what now she first observed, she turned
from him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vely▪ meaning to avoid conversing with
him the rest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the evening; but her caution came too
late; her first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vilities had flattered both him and his
father into a belief of her favour, and this sudden
<PB N="73" REF="74"/>
drawback he imputed only to virgin modesty, which
but added to the fervour of his devoirs.</P>
<P>Camilla now perceived her own error: the perseve∣rance
of young Westwyn not merely startled, but
appalled her. His character, unassuming, though
spirited, was marked by a general decency and pro∣priety
of demeanour, that would not presumptuously
brave distancing; and awakened her, therefore, to a
review of her own conduct, as it related, or as it
might seem, to himself.</P>
<P>And here not all the guiltlessness of her intentions
could exonerate her from blame with that finely scru∣tinizing
monitor to which Heaven, in pity to those
evil propensities that law cannot touch, nor society
reclaim, has devolved its earthly jurisdiction in the
human breast. With her hopes she could play, with
her wishes she could trifle, her intentions she could
desend, her designs she could relinquish—but with her
conscience she could not combat. It pointed beyond
the present moment; it took her back to her impru∣dence
with Sir Sedley Clarendel, which should have
taught her more circumspection; and it carried her on
to the disappointment of Henry and his father, whom
while heedlessly she had won, though without the
most remote view to beguile, she might seem artfully to
have caught, for the wanton vanity of rejecting.</P>
<P>While advice and retrospection were thus alike
oppressive in accusation, her pensive air and withdrawn
smiles proved but more endearing to young Westwyn,
whose internal interpretation was so little adapted to
render them formidable, that his assiduities were but
more tender, and allowed her no repose.</P>
<P>Edgar, who with the most suffering suspense, ob∣served
her unusual seriousness, and its effect upon
Henry, drew from it, with the customary ingenuity
of sensitive minds to torment themselves, the same infe∣rence
for his causeless torture, as proved to his rival a
delusive blessing. But while thus he contemplated
Henry as the most envied of mortals, a new scene
called forth new surprise, and gave birth to yet new
doubts in his mind. He saw Camilla not merely turn
<PB N="74" REF="75"/>
wholly away from his rival, but enter into conversa∣tion,
and give, apparently, her whole attention to
Lord Valhurst, who, it was palpable, only spoke to her
of her charms, which, alternately with those of Mrs.
Berlinton, he devoted his whole time to worshipping.</P>
<P>Camilla by this action, meant simply to take the
quickest road she saw in her power to shew young
Westwyn his mistake. Lord Valhurst she held nearly
in aversion; for, though his vindication of his up∣right
motives at the bathing-house, joined to her in∣difference
in considering him either guilty or innocent,
made her conclude he might be blameless in that trans∣action,
his perpetual compliments, enforced by star∣ing
eyes and tender glances, wearied and disgusted
her. But he was always by her side, when not in the
same position with Mrs Berlinton; and while his
readiness to engage her made this her easiest expedi∣ent,
his time of life persuaded her it was the safest.
Little aware of the effect this produced upon Edgar,
she imagined he would not more notice her in any
conversation with Lord Valhurst, than if she were
discoursing with her uncle.</P>
<P>But while she judged from the sincerity of reality,
she thought not of the mischief of appearance. What
in her was designed with innocence, was rendered
suspicious to the observers by the looks and manner
of her companion. The pleasure with which he found,
at last, that incense received, which hitherto had been
slighted, gave new zest to an adulation which, while
Camilla endured merely to shew her coldness to young
Westwyn, seemed to Edgar to be offered with a gross
presumption of welcome, that must result from an
opinion it was addressed to a confirmed coquette.</P>
<P>Offended in his inmost soul by this idea, he scarce
desired to know if she were now stimulated most by a
wish to torment Henry, or himself, or only by the
general pleasure she found in this now mode of amuse∣ment.
“Be it,” cried he to Dr. Marchmont, “as
it may, with me all is equally over! I seek not to
recall an attachment liable to such intermissions, such
<PB N="75" REF="76"/>
commotions. What would be my peace, my tran∣quillity,
with a companion so unstable? A mind all
at large in its pursuits?—a dissipated wife!—No!—I
will remain here but to let her know I acquiesce in
her dismission, and to learn in what form she has
communicated our breach to her friends.”</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont was silent, and they walked out
of the room together; leaving the deceived Camilla
persuaded he was so indifferent with regard to the old
peer, that all her influence was lost, and all her late
exertions were thrown away, by one evening's re∣missness
in exciting his fears of a young rival.</P>
<P>Melmond returned to Southampton the next morn∣ing
with an air of deep and settled melancholy. He
had found the two brothers together, and the candour
of his appearance, the plainness of his declaration,
the openness with which he stated his situation, and
his near relationship to Mrs. Berlinton, procured him
a courteous hearing; and he soon saw that both the
father and the uncle, though they desired time for
consideration and inquiry, were disposed to favour
him. Mr. Tyrold, though, to his acknowledged
recent disappointment of fortune, he attributed his
address, had so little hope that any man at once ami∣able
and rich would present himself to his unfortunate
Eugenia, that, when he saw a gentleman well edu∣cated,
well allied, of pleasing manners, and with
every external promise of a good and feeling charac∣ter,
modestly, and with no professions but of esteem
and respect, seek her of her friends, he thought him∣self
not even entitled to refuse him. He told him,
however, that he could conclude upon nothing in a
matter of such equal interest to himself and his wife,
without her knowledge and concurrence; and that
during the time he demanded before he gave a final
answer, he required a forbearance of all intercourse,
beyond that of a common acquaintance. His first
design was immediately to send for Eugenia home;
<PB N="76" REF="77"/>
but the young man appeared so reasonable, so mild,
so unlike a fortune-hunter, that, constitutionally in∣dulgent
where he apprehended nothing criminal, he
contented himself with writing to the same effect to
Eugenia, fully satisfied of her scrupulous punctua∣lity,
when once his will was known.</P>
<P>Melmond, though thus well received, returned
back to Southampton with any air rather than that
of a bridegroom. The order, not to wait upon Eu∣genia
in private, was the only part of his task he
performed with satisfaction; for though a mind really
virtuous made him wish to conquer his repugnance to
his future partner, he felt it could not be by com∣paring
her with Indiana.</P>
<P>Eugenia received the letter of her father, written
in his own and her uncle's name, with transport; and,
to testify her grateful obedience, resolved to name the
impending transaction to no one, and even to relinquish
her visits to Mrs. Berlinton, and only to see Melmond
when accident brought him before her in public.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Mittin, through words casually dropt,
or conversations not very delicately overheard, soon
gathered the particulars of her situation, which hap∣pily
furnished her with a new subject for a gossiping
visit to Miss Margland and Indiana. The first of
these ladies received the news with unconcern, rather
pleased than otherwise, that the temptation of an
heiress should be removed from any rivalry with the
charms of her fair pupil; who, by no means, how∣ever,
listened to the account with equal indifference.
The sight of Melmond at Southampton, with the
circumstance of his being brother to the Honourable
Mrs. Berlinton, had awakened all the pleasure with
which she had first met his impassioned admiration;
and while she haughtily expected from every public
exhibition, “to bring home hearts by dozens,” the
secret point she had in view, was shewing Melmond
that her power over others was as mighty as it had
been over himself. She had not taken the trouble to
ask with what end: what was passed never afforded
<PB N="77" REF="78"/>
her an observation; what was to come never called
forth an idea. Occupied only by the present moment,
things gone remained upon her memory but as mat∣ters
of fact, and all her expectations she looked for∣ward
to but as matters of course. To lose▪ therefore,
a conquest she had thought the victim of her beauty
for life, was a surprise nearly incredible; to lose him
to Eugenia an affront scarcely supportable; and she
waited but an opportunity to kill him with her disdain.
But Melmond, who dreaded nothing so much as an
interview; availed himself of the commands of Mr.
Tyrold, in not going to the lodgings of Eugenia,
and lived absorbed in a melancholy retirement which,
books alone could a little alleviate.</P>
<P>The conclusion of the letter of Mr. Tyrold, gave
to Camilla as much pain as every other part of it
gave to Eugenia pleasure: it was an earnest and pa∣rentally
tender prayer, that the alliance with Mel∣mond,
should his worth appear such as to authorise
its taking place, might prove the counterpart to the
happiness so sweetly promised from that of her sister
with Edgar.</P>
<P>While Camilla sighed to consider how wide from
the certainty with which he mentioned it was such an
event, she blushed that he should be thus uninformed
of her insecurity: but while a reconciliation was not
more her hope than her expectation with every rising
sun, she could not endure to break his repose with the
knowledge of a suspense she thought as disgraceful as
it was unhappy. Yet her present scheme to accele∣rate
its termination, became difficult even of trial.</P>
<P>The obviously serious regard of Henry was a con∣tinual
reproach to her; and the undisguised approba∣tion
of his father was equally painful. Yet she could
now only escape them by turning to some other, and
that other was necessarily Lord Valhurst, whose close
siege to her notice forced off every assailant but him∣self.
This the deluded Camilla thought an expedient
the most innoxious; and gave to him so much of her
time, that his susceptibility of the charms of youth
<PB N="78" REF="79"/>
and beauty was put to a trial beyond his fortitude;
and in a very few days, notwithstanding their dispro∣portion
in age, his embarrassed though large estates,
and the little or no fortune she had in view, he de∣termined
to marry her; for when a man of rank and
riches resolves to propose himself to a woman who has
neither, he conceives his acceptance not a matter of
doubt</P>
<P>In any other society, his admiration of Camilla
might easily, like what he had already experienced
and forgotten for thousands of her sex, have escaped
so grave or decided a tendency; but in Mrs. Berlin∣ton
he saw so much of youth and beauty bestowed
upon a man whom he knew to be his own senior in
age, that the idea of a handsome young wife was per∣petually
present to him. He weighed, like all people
who seek to entice themselves to their own wishes, but
one side of the question; and risked, like all who suc∣ceed
in such self-seduction, the inconvenience of finding
out the other side too late. He saw the attractions
of his fair kinswoman; but neglected to consider of
how little avail they were to her husband; he thought
with exultation of that husband's age, and almost
childishness; but forgot to take into the scales, that
they had obtained from his youthful choice only
disgust and avoidance.</P>
<P>While he waited for some trinkets, which he had
ordered from town, to have ready for presenting with
his proposals, Edgar only sought an opportunity and
courage to take his last farewel. Whenever Camilla
was so much engaged with others that it was impossi∣ble
to approach her, he thought himself capable of
uttering an eternal adieu; but when, by any open∣ing,
he saw where and how he might address her, his
feet refused to move, his tongue became parched, and
his pleading heart seemed exclaiming: O, not to∣night!
yet, yet, another day, ere Camilla is parted
with for ever!</P>
<P>But suddenly, soon after, Camilla ceased to ap∣pear.
At the rooms, at the plays, at the balls, and
<PB N="79" REF="80"/>
at the private assemblies, Edgar looked for her in
vain. Her old adulator, also, vanished from public
places, while her young admirer and his father hover∣ed
about in them as usual, but spiritless, comfortless,
and as if in the same search as himself.</P>

<DIV2 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Juvenile Calculations.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Norfield, a lady whom circumstances had
brought into some intimacy with Mrs. Berlinton upon
her marriage, had endeavoured, from the first of her
entrance into high life, to draw her into a love of
play; not with an idea of doing her any mischief,
for she was no more her enemy than her friend; but
to answer her own purposes of having a Faro table
under her own direction. She was a woman of fashion,
and as such every-where received; but her fortune
was small, and her passion for gaming inordinate;
and as there was not, at this time, one Faro table at
Southampton, whither she was ordered for her health,
she was almost wearied into a lethargy, till her re∣iterated
intreaties prevailed, at length, with Mrs.
Berlinton to hold one at her own house.</P>
<P>The fatigue of life without view, the peril of ta∣lents
without prudence, and the satiety of pleasure
without intermission, were already dangerously assault∣ing
the early independence and premature power of
Mrs. Berlinton; and the moment of vacancy and
weariness was seized by Mrs. Norfield, to press the
essay of a new mode of amusement.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton's house opened, failed not to be
filled; and opened for a Faro table, to be filled with
a peculiar set. To game has, unfortunately, always
its attractions; to game with a perfect novice is not
what will render it less alluring; and to see that no∣vice
rich and beautiful is still less likely to be repelling.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81"/>
Mr. Berlinton, when he made this marriage,
supposed he had engaged for life a fair nurse to
his infirmities; but when he saw her fixed aver∣sion,
he had not spirit to cope with it; and when
she had always an excuse for a separation, he had
not the sense to acquaint himself how she passed
her time in his absence. A natural imbecility of
mind was now nearly verging upon dotage, and as
he rarely quitted his room but at meal times, she
made a point never to see him in any other part of
the day. Her antipathy rendered her obdurate,
though her disposition was gentle, and she had now
left him at Tunbridge, to meet her aunt at South∣ampton,
with a knowledge he was too ill to follow
her, and a determination, upon various pretences,
to stay away from him for some months. The ill
fate of such unequal alliances is almost daily exem∣plified
in life; and though few young brides of old
bridegrooms fly their mates thus openly and de∣cidedly,
their retainers have seldom much cause to
rejoice in superior happiness, since they are gene∣rally
regarded but as the gaolers of their young
prey.</P>
<P>Moderation was the last praise to which Mrs.
Berlinton had any claim; what she entered upon
through persecution, in an interval of mental su∣pineness,
she was soon awake to as a pleasure, and
next pursued as a passion. Her beloved corres∣pondent
was neglected; her favourite authors were
set aside; her country rambles were given up;
balls and the rooms were forgotten; and Faro
alone engrossed her faculties by day, and her dreams
during the short epoch she reserved for sleep at
night. She lost, as might be expected, as constantly
as she played; but as money was not what she na∣turally
valued, she disdained to weigh that circum∣stance;
and so long as she had any to pay, resigned
it with more grace than by others it was won.</P>
<P>That Camilla was not caught by this ruinous
fascination, was not simply the effect of necessity.
Had the state of her finances been as flourishing as
<PB N="81" REF="82"/>
it was decayed, she would have been equally steady
in this forbearance: her reason was fair, though
her feelings frequently chased it from the field.
She looked on, therefore, with safety, though not
wholly with indifference; she had too much fancy
not to be amused by the spirit of the business, and
was too animated not to take part in the successive
hopes and fears of the several competitors; but
though her quick sensations prompted a readiness,
like that of Mrs. Berlinton, to enter warmly into
all that was presented to her, the resemblance
went no further; what she was once convinced was
wrong, she was incapable of practising.</P>
<P>Upon Gaming, the first feeling and the latest
reflection are commonly one; both point its
hazards to be unnecessary, its purposes rapacious,
and its end desperate loss, or destructive gain; she
not only, therefore, held back; she took the
liberty, upon the privilege of their avowed friend∣ship,
to remonstrate against this dangerous pastime
with Mrs. Berlinton. But that lady, though emi∣nently
designed to be amiable, had now contracted
the fearful habit of giving way to every propensity;
and finding her native notions of happiness were
blighted in the bud, concluded that all which now
remained for her was the indulgence of every lux∣ury.
She heard with sweetness the expostulation
of her young friend; but she pursued her own
course.</P>
<P>In a very few days, however, while the blush of
shame dyed her beautiful cheeks, she inquired if
Camilla could lend her a little ready money.</P>
<P>A blush of no less unpleasant feelings overspread
the face of her fair guest▪ in being compelled to
own she had none to lend; but she eagerly pro∣mised
to procure some from Mrs. Mitten, who had
a note in her hand to exchange for the payment of
some small debts contracted at Tunbridge. Mrs.
Berlinton, gathering from her confusion, how ill
she was stored, would not hear of applying to this
resource, “though I hate,” she cried, “to be in∣debted
<PB N="82" REF="83"/>
to that odious old cousin, of whom I was
obliged to borrow last night.”</P>
<P>Glaring imprudence in others is a lesson even to
the most unthinking; Camilla, when she found
that Mrs. Berlinton had lost every guinea she could
command, ventured to renew still more forcibly
her exhortations against the Faro table; but Mrs.
Berlinton, notwithstanding she possessed an excel∣lent
capacity, was so little fortified with any prac∣tical
tenets either of religion or morality, that
where sentiment did not take part of what was
right, she had no preservative against what was
wrong. The Faro table, therefore, was still opened;
and Lord Valhurst, by the sums he lent, obtained
every privilege of intimacy in the family, except
that of being welcome.</P>
<P>Against this perilous mode of proceeding Camilla
was not the only warner. Mrs. Ulst saw with ex∣treme
repugnance the mode of life her niece was
pursuing, and reprimanded her with severe re∣proach;
but her influence was now lost; and Mrs.
Berlinton, though she kindly attended her, and
sought to alleviate her sufferings, acted as if she
were not in existence.</P>
<P>It was now Mrs. Mittin gained the highest point
of her ambition; Mrs. Berlinton, tired of remon∣strances
she could not controvert, and would not
observe, was extremely relieved by finding a per∣son
who would sit with her aunt, comply with her
humours, hear her lamentations, subscribe to her
opinions, and beguile her of her rigid fretfulness by
the amusement of gossiping anecdotes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin had begun life as the apprentice to
a small country milliner; but had rendered herself
so useful to a sick elderly gentlewoman, who lodged
in the house, that she left her a legacy, which, by
sinking into an annuity, enabled her to quit her
business, and set up, in her own conception, for a
gentlewoman herself; though with so very small
an income, that to sustain her new post, she was
frequently reduced to far greater dependance and
<PB N="83" REF="84"/>
hardships than she experienced in her old one.
She was good-humoured, yet laborious; gay, yet
subservient; poor, yet dissipated. To be useful
she would submit to any drudgery; to become
agreeable, devote herself to any flattery. To please
was her incessant desire, and her rage for popularity
included every rank and class of society. The
more eminent, of course, were her first objects, but
the same aim descended to the lowest. She would
work, read, go of errands, or cook a dinner; be a
parasite, a spy, an attendant, a drudge; keep a
secret, or spread a report; incite a quarrel, or coax
contending parties into peace; invent any expedi∣ent,
and execute any scheme—all with the pretext
to oblige others, but all, in fact, for simple ego∣tism;
as prevalent in her mind as in that of the
more highly ambitious, though meauer and less
dangerous.</P>
<P>Camilla was much relieved when she found this
officious person was no longer retained solely upon
her account; but still she could neither obtain her
bills, no answers ever arriving, nor the money for
her twenty pound note, Mrs. Mitten always evad∣ing
to deliver it, and asserting she was sure some∣body
would come in the stage the next day for the
payment she had promised; and when Camilla
wanted cash for any of the very few articles she
now allowed herself to think indispensible, instead
of restoring it into her hands, she flew out herself
to purchase the goods that were required, and al∣ways
brought them home with assurances they
were cheaper than the shopkeepers would let her
have them for herself.</P>
<P>Camilla resisted all incitements to new dress and
new ornaments, with a fortitude which must not
be judged by the aged, nor the retired, who weigh∣ing
only the frivolity of what she withstood, are
not qualified to appreciate the merit of this sort of
resignation; the young, the gay, the new in life,
who know that, amongst minor calamities, none
are more alarming to the juvenile breast than the
<PB N="84" REF="85"/>
fear of not appearing initiated in the reigning
modes, can alone do justice to the present philoso∣phy
of Camilla, in seeing that all she wore, by the
quick changes of fashion, seemed already out of
date; in refusing to look at the perpetual diversity
of apparel daily brought, by various dress model∣lers,
for the approbation of Mrs. Berlinton, and in
seeing that lady always newly, brightly, and in a
distinguished manner attired, yet appearing by her
side in exactly the same array that she had constantly
worn at Tunbridge. Nor was Camilla indifferent
to this contrast; but she submitted to it as the
duty of her present involved situation, which ex∣acted
from her every privation, in preference to be∣stowing
upon any new expence the only sum she
could command towards clearing what was past.</P>
<P>But, after a very short time, the little wardrobe
exhibited a worse quality than that of not keeping
pace with the last devises of the <HI>ton;</HI> it lost not
merely its newness, but its delicacy. Alas! thought
she, how long, in the careful and rare wear of
Etherington and Cleves, all this would have served
me; while here, in this daily use, a fortnight is
scarce passed, yet all is spoilt and destroyed. Ah!
public places are only for the rich!</P>
<P>Now, therefore, Mrs. Mittin was of serious
utility; she failed not to observe the declining
state of her attire; and though she wondered at the
parsimony which so resolutely prohibited all orders
for its renewal, in a young lady she considered as
so great an heiress, she was yet proud to display her
various powers of proving serviceable. She turned,
changed, rubbed, cleaned, and new made up all
the several articles of which her dress was com∣posed,
to so much advantage, and with such strik∣ing
effect, that for yet a few days more all seemed
renewed, and by the arts of some few alterations,
her appearance was rather more than less fashion∣able
than upon her first arrival.</P>
<P>But this could not last long; and when all,
again, was fading into a state of decay, Mrs. Ber∣linton
<PB N="85" REF="86"/>
received an invitation for herself and her
fair guest, to a great ball and supper, given upon
the occasion of a young nobleman's coming of age,
in which all the dancers, by agreement, were to be
habited in uniform.</P>
<P>This uniform was to be clear fine lawn, with
lilac plumes and ornaments.</P>
<P>Camilla had now, with consuming regret, passed
several days without one sight of Edgar. This
invitation, therefore, which was general to all the
company at Southampton, was, in its first sound,
delicious; but became, upon consideration, the re∣verse.
Clear lawn and lilac plumes and ornaments
she had none; how to go she knew not; yet Edgar
she was sure would be there; how to stay away she
knew less.</P>
<P>This was a severe moment to her courage; she
felt it faultering, and putting down the card of in∣vitation,
without the force of desiring Mrs. Berlin∣ton
to make her excuse, repaired to her own room,
terrified by the preponderance of her wishes to a
consent which she knew her situation rendered un∣warrantable.</P>
<P>There, however, though she gained time for re∣flection,
she gathered not the resolution she sought.
The stay at Southampton, by the desire of Lyn∣mere,
had been lengthened; yet only a week now
remained, before she must return to her father and
her uncle—but how return? separated from Ed∣gar?
Edgar whom she still believed she had only
to see again in some more auspicious moment, to
re-conquer and six for life! But when and where
might that auspicious moment be looked for? not
at Mrs. Berlinton's; there he no more attempted
to visit: not at the Rooms; those now were de∣cidedly
relinquished, and all general invitations
were inadequate to draw Mrs. Berlinton from her
new pursuit: where, then, was this happy expla∣nation
to pass?</P>
<P>When our wishes can only be gratified with dif∣ficulty,
we conclude, in the ardour of combating
<PB N="86" REF="87"/>
their obstacle, that to lose them, is to lose every
thing, to obtain them is to ensure all good. At
this ball, and this supper, Camilla painted Edgar
completely restored to her; she was certain he
would dance with her; she was sure he would sit
by no one else during the repast; the many days
since they had met would endear to him every mo∣ment
they could now spend together, and her active
imagination soon worked up scenes so important
from this evening, that she next persuaded her be∣lief
that all chance of reconciliation hung wholly
upon the meeting it offered.</P>
<P>Impelled by this notion, yet wavering, dissatis∣fied,
and uncomfortable, she summoned Mrs. Mit∣ten,
and intreated she would make such inquiries
concerning the value of the ball-dress uniform, as
would enable her to estimate its entire expence.</P>
<P>Her hours passed in extreme disquietude; for
while all her hopes centred in the approaching fes∣tival,
the estimate was to determine her power of
enjoying it was by no means easy to procure.
Mrs. Mittin, though an adept in such matters,
took more pleasure in the parade than in the per∣formance
of her task; and always answered to her
inquiries, that it was impossible to speak so soon;
that she must go to such another shop first; that
she must consult with such and such a person; and
that she must consider over more closely the orders
given by Mrs. Berlinton, which were to be her di∣rection,
though with the stipulation of having ma∣terials
much cheaper and more common.</P>
<P>At length, however, she burst into her room,
one morning, before she was dressed, saying:
“Now, my dear miss, I hope I shall make you
happy;” and displayed, upon the bed, a beautiful
piece of fine lawn.</P>
<P>Camilla examined and admired it, asked what it
was a yard, and how much would suffice for the
dress.</P>
<P>“Why, my dear, I'll answer for it there's
enough for three whole dresses; why it's a whole
<PB N="87" REF="88"/>
piece; and I dare say I can get a hankerchief and
an apron out of it into the bargain.”</P>
<P>“But I want neither handkerchief, nor apron,
nor three dresses, Mrs. Mittin; I shall take the
smallest quantity that is possible, if I take any
at all.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten said that the man would not cut it,
and she must take the whole, or none.</P>
<P>Camilla was amazed she could so far have mis∣understood
her as to bring it upon such terms, and
begged she would carry it back.</P>
<P>“Nay, if you don't take this, my dear, there's
nothing in the shops that comes near it for less than
fifteen shillings a-yard; Mrs. Berlinton gives
eighteen for her's, and it don't look one bit to
choose; and this, if you take it all together, you
may have for ten, for all its width, for there's 30
yards, and the piece comes to but fifteen pound.”</P>
<P>Camilla protested she would not, at this time,
pay ten shillings a-yard for any gown in the
world.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, who had flattered herself that the
handkerchief and apron, at least, if not one of the
gowns, would have fallen to her share, was much
discomposed by this unexpected declaration; and
disappointed, murmuring, and conceiving her the
most avaricious of mortals, was forced away; leav∣ing
Camilla in complete despondence of any power
to effect her wish with propriety.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin came back late, and with a look of
dismay; the man of whom she had had the muslin,
who was a traveller, whom she had met at a friend's,
had not waited her return; and, as she had left the
fifteen pounds with him, for a pledge of the secu∣rity
of his goods, she supposed he had made off, to
get rid of the whole piece at once.</P>
<P>Camilla felt petrified. No possible pleasure or
desire could urge her, deliberately, to what she
deemed an extravagance; yet here, in one moment,
she was despoiled of three parts of all she possessed,
<PB N="88" REF="89"/>
either for her own use, or towards the restitution
of her just debts with others.</P>
<P>Observing her distress, though with more dis∣pleasure
than pity, from believing it founded in
the most extraordinary covetousness, Mrs. Mitten
proposed measuring the piece in three, and dispos∣ing
of the two gowns she did not want to Mrs.
Berlinton, or her sister and Miss Lynmere.</P>
<P>Camilla was a little revived; but the respite of
difficulty was short; upon opening the piece, it was
found damaged; and after the first few yards;
which Mrs. Mittin had sedulously examined, not a
breadth had escaped some rent, fray, or mischief.</P>
<P>The ill being now irremediable, to make up the
dress in the cheapest manner possible was the only
consolation that remained. Mrs. Mittin knew a
mantua-maker who, to oblige her, would under∣take
this for a very small payment; and she pro∣mised
to procure every thing else that was neces∣sary
for the merest trisle.</P>
<P>Determined, however, to risk nothing more in
such hands, she now positively demanded that the
residue of the note should be restored to her own
keeping. Mrs. Mittin, though much affronted,
honestly refunded the five pounds. The little ar∣ticles
she had occasionally brought were still unpaid
for; but her passion for detaining the money was
merely with a view to give herself consequence, in
boasting how and by whom she was trusted, and
now and then drawing out her purse, before those
who had less to produce; but wholly without any
design of imposition or fraud; all she could obtain
by hints and address she conceived to be fair
booty; but further she went not even in thought.</P>
<P>Three days now only remained before this
event-promising ball was to take place, and within
three after it, the Southampton expedition was to
close. Camilla scarce breathed from impatience
for the important moment, which was preceded
by an invitation to all the company, to take a sail
on the Southampton water on the morning of the
entertainment.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Water Party.</HEAD>
<P>THE ball dress of Camilla was not yet ready,
when she set out for the amusement of the morn∣ing.
Melmond, upon this occasion, was forced
into the excursion; his sister represented, so pathe∣tically,
the ungrateful ill-breeding of sequestering
himself from a company of which it must so pub∣licly
be judged Eugenia would make one, with the
impossibility of for ever escaping the sight of Indi∣ana,
that he could not, in common decency, any
longer postpone the double meeting he almost
equally dreaded.</P>
<P>And this, with all that could aggravate its
misery, from seeing the two objects together, im∣mediately
occurred. Sir Hugh Tyrold's coach,
containing Miss Margland, Indiana, Eugenia, and
Dr. Orkborne, was arrived just before that of
Mrs. Berlinton; and, the morning being very fine,
they had just alighted, to join the company assemb∣ling
upon the beech for the expedition. Miss
Margland still continued to exact the attendance of
the Doctor, though his wry looks and sluggish
pace always proclaimed his ill will to the task.
But Clermont, the only proper beau for her par∣ties,
was completely unattainable. He had con∣connected
himself with young Halder, and his as∣sociates,
from whom, while he received instruc∣tions
relative to the stables and the dog-kennels, he
returned, with suitable edification, lessons on the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulinary art.</P>
<P>Melmond, deeply distressed, besought his sister
not to alight till the last moment. She pitied him
too sincerely not to comply; and, in a very short
time, she had herself an aggregate of almost all the
gentlemen on the beech before the coach.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91"/>
Among these, the first to press forward were the
two Westwyns, each enraptured to again see Ca∣milla;
and the most successful in obtaining notice was
lord Valhurst, with whom Camilla still thought it
prudent, however irksome, to discourse, rather than
receive again the assiduities of Henry: but her
mind, far from them all, was hovering on the edge
of the shore, where Edgar was walking.</P>
<P>Edgar, for some time past, had joined the utmost
uneasiness what conduct to pursue with regard to
the friends of Camilla, to the heart-rending deci∣sion
of parting from her for ever. He soon learnt
the new and dangerous manner in which Mrs.
Berlinton spent her evenings, and the idea that
most naturally occurred to him, was imparting it
to Mr. Tyrold. But in what way could he ad∣dress
that gentlemen, without first knowing if Ca∣milla
had acquainted him with the step she had
taken? He felt too strongly the severe blow it
would prove, not to wish softening it with every
palliation; and while these still lingering feelings
awed his proceedings, his servant learnt, from
Molly Mill, that Melmond had been favourably
received at Cleves, as a suitor to Eugenia. Find∣ing
so near an alliance likely to take place with the
brother, he gave up his plan of remonstrating
against the sister, except in private counsel to Ca∣milla;
for which, and for uttering his fearful
adieu, he was now waiting but to speak to her un∣observed.</P>
<P>Still, however, with pain unabating, he saw the
eager approach to her of Henry, with disgust that
of lord Valhurst, and with alarm the general herd.</P>
<P>Lord Pervil, the young nobleman who deemed
it worth while to be at the expence of several
hundred pounds, in order to let the world know
how old he was, now, with his mother, a widow
lady, and some other relations, came down in a su∣perb
new equipage, to the water-side. Mrs. Ber∣linton
could not be so singular, as not to join in
the general crowd that flocked around them with
<PB N="91" REF="92"/>
congratulations; and all parties in a few minutes,
were assembled on one spot.</P>
<P>Edgar, when he had spoken to the group to
which the honours of the day belonged, made up
to Camilla, gravely enquired after her health; and
then placed himself as near to her as he was able,
in the hope of conferring with her when the com∣pany
began to move.</P>
<P>Her spirits now rose, and her prospects re∣opened
to their wished termination. All her re∣gret
was for Henry, who saw her present avoid∣ance,
and bemoaned her long absence, with a sad∣ness
that reproached and afflicted her.</P>
<P>A very fine yacht, and three large pleasure-boats,
were in readiness for this company, sur∣rounded
by various other vessels of all sorts and
conditions, which were filled with miscellaneous
parties, who meant to partake the same gales for
their own diversion or curiosity. The invited set
was now summoned to the water, lord Pervil and
his relations leading the way by a small boat to the
yacht, to which Mrs. Berlinton and the Cleves
party were particularly selected guests.</P>
<P>Camilla, depending upon the assistance of Edgar,
in passing through the boat to the yacht, so obvi∣ously
turned from Henry, that he lost all courage
for persevering in addressing her, and was even,
though most unwillingly, retiring from a vicinity
in which he seemed palpably obtrusive, had not
his father insisted upon detaining him, whispering,
“Be of good heart, Hal! the girl will come round
yet.”</P>
<P>Edgar kept equally near her, with a design that
was the counterpart of her own wish, of offering
her his hand when it was her turn to enter the
boat; but they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both disappointed, the Peer,
not waiting that rotation, presented her his arm
as soon as lady Pervil had led the way. There
was no redress, though Camilla was as much pro∣voked
as either of the young rivals.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93"/>
Lord Valhurst did not long exult in his vic∣tory;
the unsteadiness of the boat made him rather
want help for himself, than find force to bestow it
upon another, and, upon mounting at the helm to
pass her on the yacht, he tottered, his foot slipt,
and he must have sunk between the two vessels, had
not a waterman caught him up, and dragged him
into the yacht, with no further misfortune than a
bruised shin, wet legs and feet, and a deplorably
rueful countenance, from mingled fright and mor∣tification.</P>
<P>Edgar, not wholly unsuspicious such an acci∣dent
might happen, was darting into the boat to
snatch Camilla from its participation, when he
felt himself forcibly pulled back, and saw, at the
same moment, Henry, who had also started for∣ward,
but whom nothing had retarded, anticipate
his purpose, and aid her into the yacht.</P>
<P>Looking round to see by what, or by whom, he
had so unaccountably been stopt, he perceived old
Mr. Westwyn, his forefinger upon his nose in sign
of silence and secresy, grasping him by the coat.</P>
<P>“What is the humour of this, Sir?” cried he,
indignantly.</P>
<P>Mr. Westwyn, still making his token for discre∣tion,
and bending forward to speak in his ear, said,
“Do, there's a good soul, let my boy help that
young lady. Hal will be much obliged to you, I
can tell you: and he's a very good lad.”</P>
<P>The nature of Edgar was too candid to suffer
his wrath to resist a request so simple in sincerity;
but deeply he sighed to find, by its implication,
that the passion of Henry was thus still fed with
hopes.</P>
<P>The passing of other ladies, with their esquires,
prevented him, who had no lady he wished to con∣duct,
from making his way yet into the yacht; and
the honest old gentleman, detained by the same
reason, entered promptly into the history of the
present situation of his son with regard to Camilla;
relating, frankly, that he thought her the sweetest
<PB N="93" REF="94"/>
girl in the world, except that she did not know her
own mind; for she had been so pleased with his
son first of all, that he really thought he should
oblige her by making it a match: “which I could
not,” added he, “have the heart to refuse to a
girl that gave the boy such a good character.
You'd be surprised to know how she took to him!
you may be proud, says she to me, you may be
proud of your son! which is what I shall never
forget; for though I loved Hal just the same before,
I never could tell but what it was only because he
was my own. And I'm so afraid of behaving like
a blind old goose, that I often snub Hal, when he's
no more to blame than I am myself, for fear of his
getting out of my hands, and behaving like a cer∣tain
young man he has been brought up with, and
who, I assure you, deserves to have his ears cropt
ten times a day, for one piece of impudence or
other. I should not have been sorry if he'd fallen
into the water along with that old lord, whom I
don't wish much good to neither; for, between
friends, it seems to me that it's he that has put her
out of conceit with my poor Hal: for all of a
sudden, nobody can tell why nor wherefore, she
takes it into her head there's nothing else worth
listening to, but just his old compliments. And
my poor Hal, after thinking she had such a kind∣ness
for him, that he had nothing to do but put on
his best coat—for I told him I'd have none of his new-fangled
modes of affronting my worthy old friend,
by going to him like a postillion, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cropt head,
and half a coat—after thinking he'd only to ask his
consent, for he'd got mine without ever a word, all
at once, without the least quarrel, or either I or
Hal giving her the least offence, she won't so
much as let him speak to her; but turns off to
that old fellow that tumbled into the water there,
and had near made her flip in after, if it had not
been for my son's stopping her, which I sha'n't
forget your kindness in letting him do; but what's
more, she won't speak to me neither! though all I
<PB N="94" REF="95"/>
want is to ask her the reason of her behaviour!
which I shall certainly do, if I can catch her any
five minutes away from that lord; for you'll never
believe what good friends we were, before she took
so to him. We three, that is, she and I, and
Hal, used to speak to nobody else, scarce. Poor
Hal thought he'd got it all his own way. And I
can't but own I thought as much myself; for there
was no knowing she'd hold herself so above us,
all at once. I assure you, if we don't bring her to,
it will go pretty hard with us; for I like her just
as well as Hal does. I'd have made over to them
the best half of my income immediately.”</P>
<P>Edgar had never yet felt such serious displeasure
against Camilla, as seized him upon this artless
narrative. To have trifled thus, and, as he be∣lieved,
most wantonly, with the feelings and peace
of two amiable persons, whether from the vanity
of making a new conquest, or the tyranny of per∣secuting
an old one, shewed a love of power the
most unjustifiable, and a levity the most unpardon∣able.
And when he considered himself as exactly
in the same suspensive embarrassment, as a young
man of little more than a fortnight's acquaint∣ance,
he felt indignantly ashamed of so humiliating
a rivalry, and a strong diminution of regret at his
present purpose.</P>
<P>Melmond, meanwhile, pressed by his sister, se∣conded
by his own sense of propriety, had forced
himself to the Cleves' party; and, after bowing
civilly to Miss Margland, who courteously smiled
upon one who she imagined would become master
of Cleves, and most profoundly to Indiana, who
coloured, but deigned not the smallest salutation in
return, offered his hand to Eugenia; but with a
mind so absorbed, and steps so uncertain, that he
was unable to afford her any assistance; and her
lameness and helplessness made her so much require
it, that she was in danger of falling every moment;
yet she felt in paradise; she thought him but en∣feebled,
as she was enfeebled herself, by a tender
<PB N="95" REF="96"/>
sensibility; and danger, therefore, was not merely
braved, it was dear, it was precious to her.</P>
<P>Indiana now consoled her mortification, with the
solace of believing a retaliation at hand, that would
overcome the otherwise indelible disgrace of being su∣perseded
by Eugenia, in a conquest. Full of her
own little scheme, she imperiously refused all offers of
aid, and walked on alone, till crossing the boat, she
gave a shriek at every step, made hazardous by her
wilful rejection of assistance, and acted over again
the charm of terror, of which she well recollected
the power upon a former occasion.</P>
<P>These were sounds to vibrate but too surely to the
heart of Melmond; he turned involuntarily to look
at her; her beauty had all its original enchantment;
and he snatched away his eyes. He led on her whom
still less he durst view; but another glance, thus sur∣prised
from him, shewed Indiana unguarded, unpro∣tected;
his imagination painted her immediately in a
watery grave; and, seeing Eugenia safe, though not
accommodated, he rushed back to the boat, and with
trembling respect implored her to accept his aid.</P>
<P>Triumphant, now, she conceived herself in her
turn, and looking at him with haughty disdain, said,
she chose to go alone; and when again he conjured
her not to risk her precious safety, added, “you
know you don't care about it; so pray go to your
Miss Eugenia Tyrold.”</P>
<P>Young Melmond, delicate, refined, and well bred,
was precisely amongst the first to feel, that a reply
such as this must be classed among the reverse of those
three epithets—had it come from any mouth but that
of Indiana!—but love is deaf, as well as blind, to
every defect of its chosen object, during the season
of passion: from her, therefore, this answer, leaving
unobserved the littleness and spleen which composed
it, retained but so much of meaning as belongs to
announcing jealousy, and in giving him that idea, filled
him with sensations that almost tore him asunder.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97"/>
Urged by her pique, she contrived, and with real
risk, to jump into the yacht alone; though, if swayed
by any less potent motive, she would sooner have re∣mained
in the boat the whole day. But what is the
strength which may be put upon a par with inclina∣tion?
and what the general courage that partial en∣terprize
will not exceed?</P>
<P>Melmond, who only to some amiable cause could
attribute whatever flowed from so beautiful an object,
having once started the idea of jealousy, could give
its source only to love: the impure spring of envy
entered not into his suggestions. What, then, was
his distraction, to think himself so greatly miserable!
to believe he was secretly favoured by Indiana, at the
instant of his first devoirs to another! Duty and de∣sire
were equally urgent to be heard; he shrunk in
utter despondence from the two objects that seemed
to personify both, and retreated, to the utmost of
his power, from the sight of either.</P>
<P>Miss Margland had more than echoed every scream
of Indiana, though nobody had seemed to hear her.
Dr. Orkborne, the only beau she could compel into
her service, was missing; her eye and voice alike
every where demanded him in vain; he neither ap∣peared
to her view, nor answered her indignant calls.
—Nor, indeed, though she forced his attendance, had
she the most remote hope of inspiriting him to any
gallantry: but still he was a man, and she thought it
a mark of consequence to have one in her train; nor
was it by any means nothing to her to torment Dr.
Orkborne with her reproaches. To dispositions highly
irascible, it is frequently more gratifying to have a
subject of complaint than of acknowledgment.</P>
<P>The ladies being now all accommodated upon the
deck, sailing orders were given, when an “holla!
holla!” making the company look round, Lynmere
desired to be admitted. All the party intended for
the yacht were already on board, and lord Pervil told
Mr. Lynmere he would find a very good place in one
of the pleasure boats: but he answered he was just
<PB N="97" REF="98"/>
come from them, and preferred going in the yacht.
Lord Pervil then only hoped the ladies would excuse
being a little crowded. Edgar had already glided in,
and Mr. Westwyn had openly declared, when asked
to go to one of the boats, that he always went where
Hal went, be it where it might.</P>
<P>Clermont, now, elbowing his way into a group of
gentlemen, and addressing himself to young Halder,
who was amongst them, said: “Do you know what
they've got to eat here.”</P>
<P>“No.”</P>
<P>“What the deuce! have you not examined the
larder? I have been looking over the three boats,
—there's nothing upon earth!—so I came to see if
I could do any better here.”</P>
<P>Halder vowed if there were nothing to eat, he
would sooner jump over board, and swim to shore,
than go starving on.</P>
<P>“Starving?” said Mr Westwyn, “why I saw,
myself, several baskets of provisions taken into each
of the boats.”</P>
<P>“Only ham and fowls,” answered Clermont con∣temptuously.</P>
<P>“Only ham and fowls? why what would you
have?”</P>
<P>“O the d—l,” answered he, making faces,
“not that antediluvian stuff! any thing's better than
ham and fowls.”</P>
<P>“Stilton cheese, for instance?” cried Mr. West∣wyn,
with a wrathful sneer, that made Clermont,
who could not endure, yet, for many reasons, could
not resent it, hastily decamp from his vicinity.</P>
<P>Mr. Westwyn, looking after the young epicure
with an expression of angry scorn, now took the arm
of Edgar, whose evident interest in his first commu∣nication
encouraged further confidence, and said:
“That person that you see walk that way just now,
is a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a
good caning to. I can't say I like him; yet he's ne∣phew
and heir to the very best man in the three
<PB N="98" REF="99"/>
kingdoms. However, I heartily hope his uncle
will disinherit him, for he's a poor fool as well as
a sorry fellow. I love to speak my mind plainly.”</P>
<P>Edgar was ill-disposed to conversation, and in∣tent
only upon Camilla, who was now seated be∣tween
Mrs. Berlinton and Eugenia, and occupied
by the fine prospects every where open to her; yet
he explained the error of Clermont's being heir,
as well as nephew, to Sir Hugh; at which the old
gentleman, almost jumping with surprize and joy,
said: “Why, then who's to pay all his debts at
Leipsic? I can't say but what I'm glad to hear this.
I hope he'll be sent to prison, with all my heart,
to teach him a little better manners. For my old
friend will never cure him; he spoils young people
prodigiously. I don't believe he'd so much as give
'em a horse-whipping, let 'em do what they would.
That i'n't my way. Ask Hal!”</P>
<P>Here he stopt, disturbed by a new sight, which
displaced Clermont from his thoughts.</P>
<P>Camilla, to whom the beauties of nature had
mental, as well as visual charms, from the bles∣sings,
as well as pleasure, she had from childhood
been instructed to consider as surrounding them,
was so enchanted with the delicious scenery every
way courting her eyes, the transparent bright∣ness
of the noble piece of water upon which she
was sailing, the richness and verdure of its banks,
the still and gently gliding motion of the vessel,
the clearness of the heavens, and the serenity of
the air, that all her cares, for a while, would have
been lost in admiring contemplation, had she not
painfully seen the eternal watching of Henry for
her notice, and gathered from the expression of his
eyes, his intended expostulation. The self-reproach
with which she felt how ill she could make her de∣fence,
joined to a sincere and generous wish to spare
him the humiliation of a rejection, made her seek
so to engage herself, as to prevent the possibility of
his uttering two sentences following. But as this
was difficult with Eugenia, who was lost in silent
<PB N="99" REF="100"/>
meditation upon her own happiness, or Mrs. Ber∣linton,
who was occupied in examining the beauty
so fatal to the repose of her brother, she had found
such trouble in eluding him, that, when she saw
lord Valhurst advance from the cabin, where he
had been drying and refreshing himself, she wel∣comed
him as a resource, and, taking advantage of
the civility she owed him for what he had suffered
in esquiring her, gave him her sole attention; al∣ways
persuaded his admiration was but a sort of
old fashioned politeness, equally without design in
itself, or subject for comment in others.</P>
<P>But what is so hard to judge as the human heart▪
The fairest observers misconstrue all motives to
action, where any received prepossession has found
an hypothesis. To Edgar this conduct appeared the
most degrading fondness for adulation, and to Mr.
Westwyn a tyrannical caprice, meant to mortify
his son. “I hope you saw that! I hope you saw
that!” cried he, “for now I don't care a pin
for her any longer! and if Hal is such a mere
fool as ever to think of her any more, I'll never
see his face again as long as I live. After looking
askew at the poor boy all this time, to turn about
and make way for that nasty old fellow; as who
should say, I'll speak to nothing but a lord! is
what I shall never forgive, and I wish I had never
seen the girl, nor Hal neither. I can't say I like
such ways. I can't abide 'em.”</P>
<P>A sigh that then escaped Edgar, would have told
a more discerning person, that he came in for his
ample share in the same wish.</P>
<P>“And, after all,” continued he, “being a lord
is no such great feat that ever I could learn. Hal
might be a lord too, if he could get a title. There
is nothing required for it but what any man may
have; nobody asks after what he can do, or what
he can say. If he's got a good head, it's well;
and if he has not, it's all one. And that's what
you can't say of such a likely young fellow as my
son. You may see twenty for one that's as well
<PB N="100" REF="101"/>
looking. Indeed, to my mind, I don't know that
ever I saw a prettier <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad in my life. So she might
do worse, I promise her, though she has used my
son so shabbily. I don't like her the better for it,
I assure her; and so you may tell her, if you please.
I'm no great friend to not speaking my mind.”</P>
<P>The fear of being too late for the evening's ar∣rangements,
made lord Pervil, after two hours sail,
give orders for veering about: the ladies were ad∣vised
to go into the cabin during this evolution,
and Camilla was amongst those who most readily
complied, for the novelty of viewing what she had
not yet seen. But when, with the rest, she was
returning to the deck, lord Valhurst, who had
just descended, entreated her to stop one moment.</P>
<P>Not at all conjecturing his reason, she knew not
how to refuse, but innocently begged him to speak
quick, as she was in haste, not to lose any of the
beautiful landscapes they were passing.</P>
<P>“Ah what,” cried the enamoured peer, “what
in the world is beautiful in any comparison with
yourself? To me no possible object can have such
charms; and I have now no wish remaining but
never to lose sight of it.</P>
<P>Amazed beyond all measure, she stared at him a
moment in silence, and then, confirmed by his
looks that he was serious, would have left the cabin
with precipitance; but, preventing her from pas∣sing:
“Charming Miss Tyrold!” he cried, “let
the confession of my flame meet your favour, and I
will instantly make my proposals to your friends.”</P>
<P>To Camilla this offer appeared as little delicate,
as its maker was attractive; yet she thought herself
indebted for its general purport, and, as soon as
her astonishment allawed her, gracefully thanked
him for the honour of his good opinion, but en∣treated
him to make no application to her friends,
as it would not be in her power to concur in their
consent.</P>
<P>Concluding this to be modest shyness, he was
beginning a passionate protestation of the warmth
<PB N="101" REF="102"/>
of his regard, when the effusion was stopt by the
appearance of Edgar.</P>
<P>Little imagining so serious a scene to be passing
as the few words he now gathered gave him to un∣derstand,
his perplexity at her not returning with
the other ladies, made him suggest this to be a fa∣vourable
moment to seize for following her himself,
and demanding the sought, though dreaded confe∣rence.
But when he found that his lordship, in∣stead
of making, as he had supposed, his usual
fond, yet unmeaning compliments, was pompously
offering his hand, he precipitately retired.</P>
<P>No liveliness of temper had injured in Camilla
the real modesty of her character. A sense there∣fore,
of obligation for this partiality accompanied
its surprise, and was preparing her for repeating
the rejection with acknowledgements though with
firmness, when the sight of Edgar brought an en∣tirely
new train of feelings and ideas into her
mind. O! happy moment! thought she; he must
have heard enough of what was passed to know me,
at least, to be disinterested! he must see, now, it
was himself, not his situation in life, I was so
prompt in accepting—and if again he manifests
the same preference, I may receive it with more
frankness than ever, for he will see my whole
heart, sincerely, singly, inviolably his own!</P>
<P>Bewitched with this notion, she escaped from the
peer, and ran up to the deck, with a renovation
of animal spirits, so high, so lively, and so buoyant,
that she scarce knew what she said or did, from
the uncontrolable gaiety, which made every idea
dance to a happiness new even to her happy mind.
Whoever she looked at, she smiled upon; to what∣ever
was proposed, she assented: scarce could she
restrain her voice from involuntarily singing, or
her feet from instinctively dancing.</P>
<P>Edgar, compared with what he now felt, be∣lieved
that hitherto he had been a stranger to what
wonder meant. Is this, thought he, Camilla?
Has she wilfully fascinated this old man seriously
<PB N="102" REF="103"/>
to win him, and has she won him but to triumph
in the vanity of her conquest? How is her delicacy
perverted! what is become of her sensibility? Is
this the artless Camilla? modest as she was gay,
docile as she was spirited, gentle as she was intelli∣gent?
O how spoilt! how altered! how gone!</P>
<P>Camilla, little suspicious of this construction,
thought it would be now equally wrong to speak
any more with either Henry or lord Valhurst, and
talked with all others indiscriminately, changing
her object with almost every speech.</P>
<P>A moment's reflection would have told her, that
quietness, alone, in her present situation, could
do justice to the purity of her intentions: but re∣flection
is rarely the partner of happiness in the
youthful breast; it is commonly brought by sor∣row,
and flies at the first dawn of returning joy.</P>
<P>Thus, while she dispensed to all around, with
views the most innocent, her gay and almost wild
felicity, the very delight to which she owed her
animation, of believing she was evincing to Edgar
with what singleness she was his own, gave her the
appearance, in his judgment, of a finished, a vain,
an all-accomplished coquette. The exaltation of
her ideas brightened her eyes into a vivacity almost
dazzling, gave an attraction to her smiles that was
irresistible, the charm of fascination to the sound of
her voice, to her air a thousand nameless graces,
and to her manner and expression an enchantment.</P>
<P>Powers so captivating, now for the first time
united with a sacility of intercourse, soon drew
around her all the attendant admiring beaux.</P>
<P>No animal is more gregarious than a fashionable
young man, who, whatever may be his abilities to
think, rarely decides, and still less frequently acts
for himself. He may wish, he may appreciate,
internally with justice and wisdom; but he only
says, and only does, what some other man of
fashion, higher in vogue, or older in courage,
has said or has done before him.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104"/>
The young lord Pervil, the star of the present day,
was now drawn into the magic circle of Camilla;
this was full sufficient to bring into it every minor
luminary of his constellation; and even the res∣plendent
and incomparable beauty of Indiana, even
the soft and melting influence of the expressively
lovely Mrs. Berlinton, gave way to the superior as∣cendance
of that varied grace, and winning viva∣city,
which seemed instinctively sharing with the
beholders its own pleasure and animation.</P>
<P>To Edgar alone this gave her not new charms:
he saw in her more of beauty but less of interest;
the sentence dictated by Dr. Marchmont, as the
watchword to his feelings, <HI>were she mine,</HI> recurred
to him incessantly; alas! he thought, with this
dissipated delight in admiration, what individual
can make her happy? to the rational serenity of
domestic life, she is lost!</P>
<P>Again, as he viewed the thickening group before
her, offering fresh and fresh incense, which her
occupied mind scarce perceived, though her ele∣vated
spirits unconsciously encouraged, he inter∣nally
exclaimed: “O, if her trusting father saw
her thus? her father who, with all his tender le∣nity,
has not the blind indulgence of her uncle,
how would he start! how would his sense of sair
propriety be revolted!—or if her mother—her res∣pectable
mother beheld, thus changed, thus undig∣nified,
thus open to all flattery and all flatterers,
her no longer peerless daughter—how would she
blush! how would the tint of shame rob her im∣pressive
countenance of its noble confidence!”</P>
<P>These thoughts were too agitating for observati∣on;
his eyes moistened with sadness in associating
to his disappointment that of her revered and ex∣emplary
parents, and he retreated from her sight
till the moment of landing; when with sudden
desperation, melancholy yet determined, he told
himself he would no longer be withheld from ful∣filling
his purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105"/>
He made way, then, to the group, though with
unsteady steps; his eye pierced through to Camilla;
she caught and fixt it. He felt cold; but still ad∣vanced.
She saw the change, but did not under∣stand
it. He offered her his hand before lady Per∣vil
arose to lead the way, lest some competitor
should seize it; she accepted it, rather surprised by
such sudden promptness, though encouraged by it
to a still further dependance upon her revived and
sanguine expectations.</P>
<P>Yet deeper sunk this flattering illusion, when she
found his whole frame was shaking, and saw his
complexion every moment varying. She con∣tinued,
though in a less disengaged manner, her
sprightly discourse with the group; for he uttered
not a word. Content that he had secured her
hand. he waited an opportunity less public.</P>
<P>Lady Pervil, who possessed that true politeness
of a well-bred woman of rank, who knows herself
never so much respected as when she lays aside mere
heraldic claims to superiority, would not quit the
yacht of which she did the honours, till every
other lady was conducted to the shore. Edgar had
else purposed to have detained Camilla in the ves∣sel
a moment later than her party, to hear the
very few words it was his intention to speak.
Frustrated of this design, he led her away with
the rest, still totally silent, till her feet touched the
beech: she was then, with seeming carelessness,
withdrawing her hand, to trip off to Mrs. Berlin∣ton;
but Edgar, suddenly grasping it, tremulously
said: “Will it be too much presumption—in a
rejected man—to beg the honour of three minutes
conference with Miss Tyrold, before she joins
her party?</P>
<P>A voice piercing from the deep could not have
caused in Camilla a more immediate revulsion of
ideas; but she was silent, in her turn, and he led
her along the beech, while Mrs. Berlinton, attended
by a train of beaux, went to her carriage, where,
thus engaged, she contentedly waited.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106"/>
“Do not fear,” he resumed, when they had
passed the crowd, “do not fear to listen to me,
though, once more, I venture to obtrude upon you
some advice; let it not displease you; it is in the
spirit of the purest good will; it is singly, solely,
and disinterestedly as a friend.”</P>
<P>Camilla was now all emotion; pale she turned,
but Edgar did not look at her; and she strove to
thank him in a common manner, and to appear
cool and unmoved.</P>
<P>“My opinion, my fears rather, concerning
Mrs. Berlinton, as I find she hopes soon for a near
connexion with your family, will henceforth re∣main
buried in my own breast: yet, should you,
to any use hereafter remember them, I shall re∣joice:
though should nothing ever recur to remind
you of them, I shall rejoice still more. Nor will
I again torment you about that very underbred
woman who inhabits the same house, and who
every where boasts an intimacy with its two ladies,
that is heard with general astonishment: nor yet
upon another, and far more important topic, will
I now touch,—the present evening recreation at
Mrs. Berlinton's. I know you are merely a spec∣tatress,
and I will not alarm your friends, nor
dwell myself, upon collateral mischiefs, or event∣ual
dangers, from a business that in three days
will end, by your restoration to the most respecta∣ble
of all protections. All that, now, I mean to
enter upon, all that, now, I wish to enforce, a few
words will comprise, and those words will be my—”</P>
<P>He would have said <HI>my last,</HI> but his breath failed
him; he stopt; he wanted her to seize his meaning
unpronounced; and, though it came to her as a
thunder bolt from heaven, its very horror helped
her; she divined what he could not utter, by feel∣ing
what she could not hear.</P>
<P>“Few, indeed,” cried he, in broken accents,
“must be these final words! but how can I set out
upon my so long procrastinated tour, with an idea
that you are not in perfect safety, yet without at∣tempting
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
to point out to you your danger? And
yet,—that you should be surrounded by admirers
can create no wonder;—that you should feel your
power without displeasure, is equally natural;—I
scarcely know, therefore, what I would urge—yet
perhaps, untold, you may conceive what struggles
in my breast, and do justice to the conflict between
friendship and respect, where one prompts a free∣dom,
which the other troubles to execute. I need
not, I think, say, that to offend you is nearly the
only thing that could aggravate the affliction of
this parting.”—</P>
<P>Camilla turned aside from him; but not to
weep; her spirit was now re-wakened by resent∣ment,
that he could thus propose a separation,
without enquiring if she persisted to desire it.</P>
<P>“I tire you?” resumed he, mournfully; “yet
can you be angry that a little I iinger? Farewell,
however—the grave, when it closes in upon me, can
alone end my prayers for your felicity! I commit
wholly to you my character and my conduct, with
regard to your most honoured father, whom I be∣seech
and conjure you to assure of my eternal gra∣titude
and affection. But I am uncertain of your
wishes; I will, therefore, depart without seeing
him. When I return to this country, all will be
forgotten—or remembered only—” <HI>by me,</HI> he
meant to say, but he checked himself, and, with
forced composure, went on:</P>
<P>“That I travel not with any view of pleasure,
you, who know what I leave—how I prize what I
lose,—and how lately I thought all I most coveted
mine for ever, will easily believe. But if earthly
bliss is the lot of few, what right had I to expect
being so selected? Severe as is this moment, with
blessings, not with murmurs, I quit you! blessings
which my life, could it be useful to you, should
consecrate. If you were persuaded our disposi∣tions
would not assimulate; if mine appeared to
you too rigorous, too ungenial, your timely pre∣caution
has spared more misery than it has
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
inflicted. How could I have borne the light, when
it had shewn me Camilla unhappy—yet Camilla
my own—?”</P>
<P>His struggle here grew vain, his voice faultered;
the resentment of Camilla forsook her; she raised
her head, and was turning to him her softened
countenance, and filling eyes, when she saw Mel∣mond,
and a party of gentlemen, fast approaching
her from Mrs. Berlinton. Edgar saw them too,
and cutting short all he meant to have added,
kissed, without knowing what he did, the lace of
her cloak, and ejaculating “Be Heaven your guard,
and happiness your portion!” left her hand to that
of Melmond, which was held out to her, and
slightly bowing to the whole party, walked slowly,
and frequently looking back, away: while Camilla,
nearly blinded now by tears that would no longer
be restrained, kept her eyes fixedly upon the earth,
and was drawn, more dead than alive, by Mel∣mond
to the coach.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Touches of Wit and Humour.</HEAD>
<P>THE suddenness of this blow to Camilla, at the
moment when her expectations from Edgar were
wound up to the summit of all she desired, would
have stupified her into a consternation beyond even
affliction, had not the mildness of his farewell, the
kindness of his prayers, and the friendship of his
counsels, joined to the generosity of leaving wholly
to herself the account of their separation, subdued
all the pride that sought to stifle her tenderness,
and penetrated her with an admiration which left
not one particle of censure to diminish her regret.</P>
<P>Melmond and his sister, always open to distress,
and susceptible to pity, saw with true concern this
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
melancholy change, and concluded that Mandlebcrt
had communicated some painful intelligence.</P>
<P>She went straight to her own room, with a sign
of supplication that Mrs Berlinton would not fol∣low;
and turning quick from Mrs. Mittin, who
met her at the street door.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton yielded; but Mrs. Mittin was not
easily rebuffed. She was loaded with lilac plumes,
ribbands, and gauzes, and Camilla saw her bed
completely covered with her new ball dress.</P>
<P>This sight was, at first, an aggravation of her
agony, by appearing to her as superfluous as it was
expensive: but wherever hope could find an aper∣ture
to creep in at, it was sure of a welcome from
Camilla. Edgar was undoubtedly invited to the
ball; why should he not be there? he had taken
leave of her, indeed, and he certainly proposed go∣ing
abroad; but could a mere meeting once more,
be so repugnant as not to be endured.</P>
<P>The answer to this question was favourable to
her wishes, for by her wishes it was framed: and
the next play of her fertile and quick reviving ima∣gination,
described the meeting that would ensue,
the accidents that would bring them into the same
set, the circumstances that would draw them again
into conversation, and the sincerity with which she
would do justice to her unalterable esteem, by as∣suring
him how injurious to it were his surmises
that she thought him rigorous, austere, or in any
single instance to blame.</P>
<P>These hopes somewhat appeased, though their
uncertainty could not banish her terrors, and she
was able to appear at dinner tolerably composed.</P>
<P>Another affair, immediately after, superseded
them, for the present, by more urgent difficulties.</P>
<P>Soon after her arrival at Southampton, a poor
woman, who washed for her, made a petition in
behalf of her brother, a petty shop-keeper, who,
by various common, yet pitiable circumstances of
unmerited ill success in business, was unable to give
either money or security to the wholesale dealers,
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
for the renewal of his exhausted stock in trade;
though the present full season, made it rational
to suppose, that, if he had his usual commodities,
he might retrieve his credit, save himself from
bankruptcy, and his children from beggary.
These last, which were five in number, were
all, upon various pretences, brought to Camilla,
whose pity they excited by the innocence with
which they seemed ignorant of requiring it;
and who received them with smiles and encou∣ragement,
however frivolous their errands, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>requent their interruptions. But the goods
which their father wanted to lay in, to revive
his trade, demanded full thirty pounds, which,
Camilla declared, were as absolutely out of her
power to give as thirty thousand, though she
promised to plead to Sir Hugh for the sum, upon
her return to Cleves, and was prevailed with to
grant her name to this promise for the wholesale
dealers. These would trust, however, to no verbal
security; and Mrs. Mittin, who from collateral
reasons was completely a friend of the poor man,
offered to be bound for him herself, though
thirty pounds were nearly her year's income,
provided Camilla would sign a paper, by which
she would engage <HI>upon her honour,</HI> to indemnify
her of any loss she might eventually sustain
by this agreement, as soon as she was of age, or
should find it in her power before that time.</P>
<P>The seriousness of this clause, made Camilla
refuse the responsibility, protesting she should
have no added means in consequence of being
of age. But Mrs. Mittin assured Higden, the
poor man, as she assured all others, that she
was heiress to immense wealth, for she had
it from one that had it from her own brother's
own mouth; and that though she could not
find out why she was so shy of owning it, she
supposed it was only from the fear of being
imposed upon.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111"/>
The steadiness of Camilla, however, could not
withstand her compassion, when the washerwoman
brought the poor children to beg for their father; and,
certain of her uncle's bounty, she would have run a
far more palpable risk, sooner than have assumed the
force to send them weeping away.</P>
<P>The stores were then delivered; and all the family
poured forth their thanks.</P>
<P>But this day, in quitting the dining parlour, she was
stopt in the hall by Higden, who, in unfeigned ago∣nies,
related that some flasks of oil, in a small hamper,
which were amongst the miscellaneous articles of his
just collected stores, had, by some cruel accident, been
crushed, and their contents, finding their way into all
the other packages, had stained or destroyed them.</P>
<P>Camilla, to whose foresight misfortune never pre∣sented
itself, heard this with nearly equal te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>or for
herself, and sorrow for the poor man: yet her own
part, in a second minute, appeared that of mere in∣convenience,
compared with his, which seemed ruin
irretrievable; she sought, therefore, to comfort him;
but could afford no further help, since she had pain∣fully
to beg from her uncle the sum already so use∣lessly
incurred. He ventured still to press, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
again he could obtain a supply, every evil chance
should be guarded against; but Camilla had now
learned that accidents were possible; and the fear
which arises from disappointed trust, made her think
of probable mischiefs with too acute a discernment, to
deem it right to run again any hazard, where, if there
were a failure, another, not herself, would be the
sufferer. Yet the despair of the poor man induced her
to promise she would write in his favour, though not
act in it again unauthorised,</P>
<P>With feelings or still augmented discomfort, from
her denial, she repai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to her toilette; but attired
herself without seeing what she put on, or knowing,
but by Mrs. Mittin's descriptions and boastings, that
her dress was new, of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> uniform, and made
precisely like that of Mrs. Berlinton. Her agitated
spirits, suspended, not between hope and fear, but
<PB N="111" REF="112"/>
hope and despair, permitted no examination of its
elegance: the recollection of its expence, and the
knowledge that Edgar thought her degenerating into
coquetry, left nothing but regret for its wear.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who never before, since her mar∣riage,
had been of any party where her attractions had
not been unrivalled, had believed herself superior to
pleasure from personal homage, and knew not, till she
missed it, that it made any part of her amusement in
public. But the Beauty, when first she perceives a
competitor for the adulation she has enjoyed exclu∣sively,
and the Statesman, at the first turn of popular
applause to an antagonist, are the two beings who,
perhaps, for the moment, require the most severe dis∣play
of self-command, to disguise, under the sem∣blance
of good humour or indifference, the disappoint∣ment
they experience in themselves, or the contempt
with which they are seized for the changing multitude.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, though she felt no resentment
against Camilla for the desertion she had occasioned
her, felt much surprize; not to be first was new to
her: and whoever, in any station of life, any class of
society, has had regular and acknowledged precedency,
must own a sudden descent to be rather aukward.
Where resignation is voluntary, to give up the higher
place may denote more greatness of mind than to
retain it; but where imposed by others, few things
are less exhilarating to the principal, or impress less
respect upon the by-stander.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton had never been vain; but she could
not be ignorant of her beauty; and that the world's
admiration should be so wondrously <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ickle, or so cu∣riously
short-lived, as to make even the bloom of youth
fade before the higher zest of novelty, was an earlier
lesson than her mind was prepared to receive. She
thought she had dressed herself that morning with too
much carelessness of what was becoming, and devoted
to this evening a greater portion of labour and study.</P>
<P>While Camilla was impatiently waiting, Mrs.
Pollard, the washerwoman, gained admittance to her,
and bringing two interesting little children of from
<PB N="112" REF="113"/>
four to five years old, and an elder girl of eleven,
made them join with herself to implore their bene∣factress
to save them all from destruction.</P>
<P>Higden having had the imprudence, in his grief,
to make known his recent misfortune, it had reached
the ears of his landlord, who already was watchful
and su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picious, from a year and half arrears of his
rent; and steps were immediately preparing to seize
whatever was upon the premises the next morning;
which, by bringing upon him all his other creditors,
would in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y immure him in the lingering hope∣lessness
of a prison.</P>
<P>Camilla now wavered; the debt was but eighteen
pounds; the noble largesses of her uncle in charity,
till, of late, that he had been somewhat drained by
Lionel, were nearly unlimited.—She paused—looked
now at the pleading group, now at her expensive dress;
asked how, for her own hopes she could risk so much,
yet for their deliverance from ruin so little; and with
a blush turning from the mirror, and to the children
with a tear, finally cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted that the landlord should
apply to her the next morning.</P>
<P>Lord Pervil had some time opened the ball before
Mrs. Berlinton's arrival; but he looked every where
for Camilla, to succeed to a young lady of quality with
whom he had danced the first two dances.</P>
<P>He could not, however, believe he had found,
though he now soon saw and made up to her. The
brilliancy of her eyes was dimmed by weeping, her
vivacity was changed into dejection, sighs and looks
of absence took place of smiles and sallies of gaiety,
and her whole character seemed to have lost its spring
and elasticity. She gave him her hand, to preserve
her power of giving it if claimed by Edgar, and though
he had thought of her without ceasing since she had
charmed him in the yacht, till he had obtained it,
not a lady appeared in the room, by the time these
two dances were over, that he would not more chear∣fully
have chosen for two more: her gravity every
<PB N="113" REF="114"/>
minute encreased, her eye rolled, with restless anxiety,
every where, except to me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his, and so little were
her thoughts, looks, or conversation bestowed upon
her partner, that instead of finding the animated beauty
who had nearly captivated him on board the yacht, he
seemed coupled with a fair lifeless machine, whom
the music, per-force, put in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion; and relinquished
her hand with as little reluctance as she withdrew it.</P>
<P>Melmond had again, by his sister, been forced into
the party, though with added unwillingness, from his
new idea of Indiana. Now, however, to avoid that
fair bane was impossible: Indiana was the first object
to meet every eye, from the lustre of her beauty, and
the fineness of her figure, each more than ever trans∣cendently
conspicuous, from the uniform which had
obliged every other female in the room to appear in
exactly the same attire. Yet great and unrivalled as
was the admiration which she met, what came simply
and naturally was insufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the thirst with which
she now quaffed this intoxicating beverage; and to
render its draughts still more delicious, she made
Eugenia always hold by her arm. The contrast here
to the spectators was diverting as well as striking,
and renewed attention to her own charms, when the
eye began to grow nearly fated with gazing. The
ingenuous Eugenia, incapable of suspecting such a
design, was always the dupe to the request, from the
opinion it was made in kindness, to, to save her from
fatigue in the eternal sauntering of a public place;
and, lost to all fear, in being lost to all hope, as to
her own appearance, chearfully accompanied her beau∣tiful
kinswoman, without conjecturing that, in a com∣pany
whence the illiterate and vulgar were excluded,
personal impersections could excite pleasantry, or be
a subject of satire.</P>
<P>Camilla, who still saw nothing of Edgar, yet still
thought it possible he might come, joined them as soon
as she was able. Miss Margland was full of com∣plaints
about Dr. Orkborne, for his affording them no
assistance in the yacht, and not coming home even to
dinner, nor to attend them to lord Pervil's; and Eu∣genia,
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
who was sincerely attached to the Doctor, from
the many years he had been her preceptor, was be∣ginning
to express her serious uneasiness at his thus
strangely vanishing; when Clermont, with the most
obstreperous laughter, made up to them, and said:
“I'll tell you a monstrous good joke! the best thing
you ever heard in your life! the old Doctor's been
upon the very point of being drowned!—and he has
not had a morsel to eat all day!”</P>
<P>He then related that his man, having seen him
composedly seated, and musing, upon a pile of planks
which were seasoning upon the beech, with his face
turned away from the company to avoid its interrup∣tions,
had enquired if he had any commands at home?
whither he was going: “Not for meaning to do
them,” continued Lynmere: “No, no! catch Bob
at that! but only to break in upon him; for Bob's a
rare hand at a joke. He says he's ready to die with
laughing, when he speaks to the old Doctor while
he's studying, because he looks so much as if he
wished we were all hanged. However, he answered
tolerably civilly, and only desired that nobody might
go into his room till he came home from the sail, for
he'd forgot to lock it. So Bob, who smoked how the
matter was, says: “The sail, Sir, what are you
going alone, then? for all the company's been gone
these two hours.” So this put him in such a taking,
Bob says he never laughed so much in his life. He
jumped up as if he'd been bit: “Gone?” says he,
“why where's Miss Eugenia, I promised Sir Hugh
not to lose sight of her.” So he said he'd go after her
that very moment. “Call me a boat,” said he: just
as if he'd ordered a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ackney coach; for he knows
about as much of winds and tides as my little bay
Filly, that I bought of Halder yesterday for fifty
pounds, but that I shall make worth seventy in less
than a month. Well, there was nothing to be had
but a small fishing boat, so Bob winks at the man to
take in a friend; for he has all those fellows in a
string. So in went his Latinship, and off they put.
Bob fell into such a fit of laughter, he says, I might
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
have heard him a mile off. I don't think Bob has his
fellow upon earth for fun.</P>
<P>Eugenia now interrupted the narration, with a seri∣ous
enquiry where Dr. Orkborne was at present.</P>
<P>Lynmere, shouting at what he thought the ridicule
of this concern, answered, that Bob had told the
fisherman to go about his own business, unless the
Doctor offered to pay him handsomely for taking him
on board the yacht; but thinking it would be a good
joke to know what was become of him, he had gone
himself, with Halder, and some more choice blades,
to the beech, about half an hour ago, to make Bob
see if the fishing boat was come in; and, by good
J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck, they arrived at the very nick of time, and saw
the Doctor, the fish, and the fishing-tackle, all hauled
out together. “And a better sight was never seen
before, I promise you!” continued Lynmere; I
thought I should quite have burst my sides with looking
at him, he was so wet and so cold, and so miserable;
and when I thought of his having had no dinner, I
shouted till I was ready to roll on the beech—and he
smelt so of the fish, that I could have hugged Bob,
'twas such monstrous good sport. He got three half
crowns in a minute for his ingenuity. Halder be∣gan;
—and two others of us gave two more.”</P>
<P>“Poor Dr. Orkborne! and where is he now?”
said Eugenia</P>
<P>“Why we got about the fisherman, and then we
had all the same fun over again: He says, that, at
first the poor gentleman was in a great taking, fretting
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and looking out for the yacht, and seem∣ing
almost beside himself for hurry to get to it; but
after that, he takes out a little red book and a pencil,
and falls to writing, just as hard as if he'd come into
the boat for nothing else; insomuch, that when they
were just coming along-side the yacht, he never lifted
up his head, nor listened to one word, but kept
making a motion with his hand to be let alone▪ and
when the man said the yacht would be passed, he bid
him hold his peace, and not interrupt him so, in such
a pettish manner, that the man resolved to take honest
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
Bob's advice, and go on about his own business. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
so he did, and the Doctor was as content as a lord▪
till he had scribbled all he could scratch out of his
noddle: but then came the best sport of all; for
when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had nothing more to write, and looked up,
and saw the boat stock still, and the man fishing at
his leisure, and heard the yacht had been bound home∣ward
of a good hour, he was in such a perilous pas∣sion,
the man says, that he actually thought he'd have
jumped overboard. I'll bet what you will he won't
ask Bob to call him a boat again in a hurry.”</P>
<P>“As to his behaviour,” said Miss Margland, “it's
the last thing in the world to surprize me, after what
I have seen myself; nor any body else, I believe,
neither. Who is Dr. Orkborne? I doubt much if
any body ever heard his name before. I should like to
know if any body can tell who was his grand-father!”</P>
<P>She then declared, if she could get any soul to
fetch him, he should still come, if it were only that
he might not pass the evening all in his own way▪
which would be just the thing to encourage him to
hide himself out of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, on purpose not to help them
another time.</P>
<P>Eugenia was going to beg he might not be disturbed;
when Melmond, all alacrity to seize any means of
absenting himself from the two cousins, who produced
in him so severe a conflict, offered his services to
carry a message to the Doctor; which being readily
accepted, he set off.</P>
<P>Indiana and Eugenia, not wholly without similarity
of sensation, looked after him. Indiana had now caught
his eye; and though quickness was no part of her
character, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale it told had convinced her that her
power, though no longer acknowledged was not ex∣tinguished;
it required neither elemental precepts,
nor sagacious perceptions, to make this discovery, and
she exultingly determined to appease her late mortifi∣cation,
by reducing him to her feet. She stopt not
to enquire what such a step might be to Eugenia, nor
what was likely, or even desirable to be its event.
Where narrow minds imagine they have received in∣jury,
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
they seek revenge rather than redress, from an
opinion that such a conduct asserts their own impor∣tance.</P>
<P>Still vainly, and wretchedly, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes of Camilla
sought Edgar: the evening advanced, but he came
not; yet, catching a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every possible chance for hope,
she thought some other room that they had not visited,
might be open for company, where, finally they might
meet.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne accompanied Melmond back. Miss
Margland was preparing him a reproachful reception,
but was so much offended by the fishy smell which
he brought into the room, that she had immediate re∣course
to her falts, and besought him to stand out of
her way. He complied without reluctance, though
with high disdain.</P>
<P>The young ladies were all dancing, Indiana had no
sooner perceived Melmond, than she determined to
engage his attention: the arts of coquetry require but
slender parts, where the love of admiration is potent;
she pretended, therefore, to feel extremely ill, put
her hand to her forehead, and telling her partner,
Mr. Halder, she could not stand another minute,
hastened to Miss Margland, and cast herself, as if
fainting, upon her neck.</P>
<P>This had all the success with Melmond that his own
lively imagination could give it. He flew to a side∣table
to get her a glass of water, which his trembling
hand could scarce hold, but which she received from
him with a languishing sweetness, that dissolved every
tie but of love, and he “<HI>hung over her enamoured</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>;”
while Miss Margland related that she could hardly
keep from fainting herself, so much she had been
shocked and disordered by the horrid smell of Dr.
Orkborne.</P>
<P>Indiana now caught the infection, and protested
she was so much worse, that if she had not a little air
she should die. Melmond was flying to open a win∣dow,
but a lady who sat close to it, objected; and he
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
had then recourse to two folding doors, leading to a
portico open to a large garden.</P>
<P>Hither Indiana permitted herself to be led, and led
by the thrice happy, yet thrice miserable Melmond.
Miss Margland was accompanying them, but lady
Pervil, advancing to enquire what went wrong, gave
her an opportunity irresistible to inveigh against Dr.
Orkborne; and as her well-bred hearer, though little
interested in such a detail, would not interrupt it, In∣diana
arrived alone in the portico with Melmond.
Halder, who had danced with her, followed, but
supposing Melmond the favoured man, walked singing
off, and made the tour of the garden.</P>
<P>This situation was to Melmond as dangerous, as to
Indiana it was exulting. She now suddenly withdrew
her hand, with an air of poignant disdain, which the
illuminated portico and house made amply visible; and
when, surprised and much moved, he tremblingly
enquired if she were worse, she answered, “Why do
you ask? I am sure you do not care.”</P>
<P>Easily deprived of all forbearance, “Heavens!”
he exclaimed, “do I live, yet suffer this imputation!
O divine Indiana! load me with every other reproach,
rather than this dreadful charge of insensibility to all
that is most lovely, most perfect upon earth!”</P>
<P>“I thought,” said Indiana, again softening her fine
eyes, “you had quite forgot me, and all the vows
you made to me.”</P>
<P>“Wretch that I am,” cried Melmond, nearly dis∣tracted
by this charge, and by the regret at losing
him, which seemed its purpose, “condemned to
every species of woe! O fair, angelic Indiana! in a
cottage with you would I have dwelt, more delight∣edly,
and more proudly, than any potentate in the
most gorgeous palace: but, alas! from you—formed to
enchant all mankind, and add grace to every dignity—
from you could I dare ask such a sacrifice?</P>
<P>Indiana now listened with an attentive softness no
longer factitious; though all her views wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted her to
splendour and high life, her ear could not withstand
the romantic sound of love and a cottage; and though
<PB N="119" REF="120"/>
no character was ever less formed to know and taste the
blessings such a spot may bestow and reciprocate, she
imagined she might there be happy, for she considered
such a habitation but as a bower of eglantine and roses,
in which she might repose and be adored all day long.
Melmond saw but too quickly the relenting cast of her
countenance; and extacy and despair combated which
should bear sway in his breast. “Ah, madam,” he
cried, “most ado<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble and most adored of women!
you know my terrible situation, but you know not the
sufferings, nor the constancy of my heart!—the per∣secution
of friends, the pressure of distress, the hope∣lessness
of my idolized Indiana—”</P>
<P>A deep sigh interrupted him—it came not from
Indiana—startled, he looked round—and beheld Eu∣genia,
leaning against the door by which she seemed
to have intended entering, pale, petrified, aghast.</P>
<P>Shame now tied his tongue, and tingled, with
quick reproach, through his whole frame. He looked
at Indiana with despair, at Eugenia with remorse;
injured rectitude and blushing honour urged him to the
swistest termination of so every way terrible a scene,
and bowing low to Eugenia, “I durst not, madam,”
he cried, “ever hope for your pardon! yet I rather
deluded myself than deceived you when I ventured to
solicit your acceptance. Alas! I am a bankrupt both
in fortune and in heart, and can only pray you will
hasten to forget—that you may forbear to execrate
me!”</P>
<P>He then disappeared, finding a way out by the gar∣den,
to avoid re-entering the ball-room.</P>
<P>Eugenia, who, in this speech, comprehended an
eternal adieu, sunk upon the seat of the portico, cold,
shivering, almost lifeless. Little prepared for such an
event, she had followed Indiana the moment she was
disengaged from the dance, not suspicious of any
<HI>téte-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ì-tête,</HI> from believing Halder of the party. The
energy of Melmond made her approach unheard; and
the words she unavoidably caught, nearly turned her
to marble.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121"/>
Indiana was sorry for her distress, yet felt a triump<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in its cause; and wondered how so plain a little crea∣ture
could take it into her head to think of marrying.</P>
<P>Camilla now joined them, affrighted at the evident
anguish of Eugenia, who, leaning upon her affection∣ate
bosom, had the relief excited by pity, of bursting
into tears, while despondingly she uttered: “All is
over, my sister, and over for life with Eugenia!
Melmond flies and detests me! I am odious in his
fight! I am horror to his thoughts!”</P>
<P>Camilla wept over her in silent, but heart breaking
sympathy. Indiana returned to the dance: but the
two suffering sisters remained in the portico till sum∣moned
to depart. They were insensible to the night
air, from the fever of their minds. They spoke no
more; they felt the insufficiency of words to express
their griess, and their mutual compassion was all that
softened their mutual sorrows.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Adi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u.</HEAD>
<P>LOST to all happiness, and for the first time in her
life, divested of hope, Camilla at a late hour returned
to Mrs. Berlinton's And here, her heart-breaking
disappointment received the cruel aggravation of the
most severe self-reproach, when in facing the mirror
to deposit her ornaments upon the toilette table, she
considered the expensive elegance of her whole dress,
now, even in her own estimation, by its abortive pur∣pose,
rendered glaringly extravagant. Since her pro∣ject
had failed she saw the impropriety of having risked
so much in its attempt; and a train of just reflections
ensued, to which her understanding was always equal,
though her gaiety was seldom disposed. “Would
Edgar,” thought she, “wait the event of a meeting
at a ball to decide his conduct? Had he not every
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
title to claim a conference with me, if he had the
smallest inclination? Rejected as he calls himself, I
had not pretended to demand our separation from any
doubts, any displeasure of my own. From the mo∣ment
he suffered me to quit, without reclamation, the
roof under which I had proposed our parring. I ought
to have seen it was but his own desire, perhaps design,
I was executing. And all the reluctance he seemed
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel, which so weakly I attributed to regard, was
but the expiring sensibility of the last moment of inter∣course.
Not with murmurs, he says, he will quit
me—nor with murmurs will I now resign him!—with
blessings, he says, he leaves me—O Edgar! mayest
thou too be blest! The erring and unequal Camilla
deserved thee not!”</P>
<P>A more minute examination of her attire was not
calculated to improve her serenity. Her robe was
every where edged with the finest Valencienne <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace;
her lilac shoes, sash, and gloves, were richly span∣gled
with silver, and finished with a silver fringe; her
ear-rings and necklace were of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lac and gold beads;
her fan and shoe roses were brilliant with lilac foil,
and he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bouquet of artificial lilac flowers, and her
plumes of lilac feathers, were here and there tipt
with the most tiny transparent white beads, to give
them the effect of being glittering with the dew.</P>
<P>Of the cost of all this she was no judge, but, cer∣tain
its amount must be high, a warm displeasure arose
against the incorrigible Mrs. Mittin, who had not
only taken the pattern, but the value of Mrs. Berlin∣ton's
dress for her guide: and a yet greater dissatis∣faction
ensued with herself, for trusting the smallest
commission to so vain and ungovernable an agent.
She could only hope to hoard the payment from the
whole of her next year's allowance, by living in so
sorbearing and retired a manner, as to require nothing
for herself.</P>
<P>The new, but all powerful g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est which now assail∣ed
her, unhappiness, had still kept here yes from closing,
when she was called up to Mr. Tennet, the landlord
of Higden. Her fuller knowledge of her own hope∣less
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
debts, could not make her faithless to her engage∣ment;
for her acquaintance with misery awakened
but more pity for the misery of others. She admitted
him, therefore, without demur; and found he was
a land <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>eyor, who had often been employed by Sir
Hugh at Cleves. He accepted her verbal promise to
be answerable for the rent now due, declining her
note of hand, which her minority made illegal, and
engaging not to hurry her for the money; well satisfi∣ed,
by the Tyrold character in the whole county, he
might abide by her word of honour, sounded upon
the known munificence of her uncle.</P>
<P>This delay was a relief, as it saved a partial de∣mand,
that must have forced an abrupt confession of
her own debts, or have deceived the baronet into a
belief the had nothing to solicit.</P>
<P>When this business was transacted, she hastened to
Eugenia, to console whose sufferings was all that
could mitigate her own.</P>
<P>One of the maids then came to say she had forgotten
to inform her, that, some time after she had set out for
lord Pervil's, a stranger, much muffled up, and with a
hat flapped over his face so as wholly to hide it, had
enquired for her, and seemed much disturbed when he
heard she was at the ball, but said he would call again
the next day at noon.</P>
<P>No conjecture occurred to Camilla but that this
must be Edgar; it was contrary to all probability;
but no other image could find way to her mind. She
hastened, inexpressibly perturbed, to her sister, deter∣mining
to be at home before twelve o'clock, and
fashioning to herself all the varieties such a meeting
could afford; every one of which, however they be∣gan,
ended regularly with a reconciliation.</P>
<P>She found Eugenia weeping in bed. She embraced
her with the extremest tenderness: “Ah my sister!”
said the unhappy mourner, “I weep not for my
disappoinment, great as it may be—and I do not
attempt describing it!—it is but my secondary sor∣row.
I weep, Camilla, for my own infatuation! for
the folly, the blindness of which I find myself culpa∣ble.
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
O Camilla! is it possible I could ever—for a
moment, a single moment, suppose Melmond could
willingly be mine! could see his exquisite susceptibi∣lity
of every thing that is most perfect, yet persuade
myself he could take, by choice, the poor Eugenia for
his wife! the mangled, deformed,—unfortunate Eu∣genia!</P>
<P>Camilla, touched to the heart, wept now more than
her sister. “That Eugenia,” she cried, “has but to be
known, to leave all beauty, all figure, every exterior
advantage aloof, by the nobler, the more just superi∣ority
of intrinsic worth. Let our estimates but be
mental, and who will not be proud to be placed in pa∣rallel
with Eugenia?”</P>
<P>She was then beginning her own sad relation, when
an unopened letter upon the toilette table caught her
eye. It had been placed there by Molly Mill, who
thought her mistress asleep. Struck by the shape of
the seal, Camilla rose to examine it: what was her
palpitation, then, to see the cypher E M, and, turn∣ing
to the other side, to perceive the hand-writing of
Edgar!</P>
<P>She put it into her sister's hand, with expectation
too big for speech. Eugenia opened it, and they read
it silently together.</P>
<LETTER>

<P>'Tis yet but a short time—in every account but my

<P>At the kind wish upon her own opening prospects,
Eugenia wept afresh; but when Camilla took the let∣ter
to press to her lips and her heart what he said of

lines more:—</P>

<P>“No, my dear Eugenia,” cried she, then colour∣ing,
and putting down the letter, “your mediation
will be spared. He acquaints us he is quitting Eng∣land.
He can only mention it to avoid the persecuti∣on
of an answer. Certainly none shall be obtruded
upon him.”</P>
<P>Eugenia pleaded that still a letter might overtake
him at the I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Wight, and all misunderstanding
might be rectified. “And then, my sister, all may be
well, and your happiness renewed.—It is not slown from
you—like that of Eugenia—from any radical cause.
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
Her's is not only gone, past all resource, but has left
behind it disgrace with sorrow, derision with disap∣pointment!”</P>
<P>Camilla strove to soothe her, but would no longer
listen to any mediation; she resolved, at once, to write
of the separation to her father, and beseech him to
send for her to Eitherington, and never again suffer
her to quit that ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, where alone her peace was with∣out
disturbance, her conduct without reproach. Even
her debts, now, she felt equal to avowing, for as, far
from contracting new ones, she meant in future to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide
in complete obscurity, she hoped the feelings of
this moment would procure pardon for her indiscreti∣ons,
which her own sedulous future oeconomy should
be inde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigable to repair.</P>
<P>Eugenia would not strive longer against a proccdure
which she deemed dignisied, and the departure of Ca∣milla
was hurried by a messenger, who brought word
that the strange man, with the flapped hat, was return∣ed,
and entreated her, for Heaven's sake, to let him
sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak with her one moment.</P>
<P>Dead, now, to the hope she had entertained of this
enquirer. she merely from his own urgency complied
with his call; for her curiosity was gone since she now
know it could not be Edgar.</P>
<P>Edgar, indeed, was actually departed. His heart
was loaded with sorrow, his prospect seemed black
with despondence; but Camilla was lost to that per∣fect
confidence, and unbounded esteem, he required
to feel for his wise, and no tenderness without them,
no partial good opinion, nor general admiration, could
make him wish to lead her to the altar. “No!” cried
he, “Dr. Marchmont; you judged me better than
my first passion, and her untried steadiness enabled me
to judge myself. Misery only could have followed
my view of her in the mixt society in which the thou∣sand
accidents of life might occasionally have placed
us. I can only be happy with a character as simple in
the world, as in retirement; as artless at an assembly,
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
as in a cottage. Without that heavenly simplicity, the
union of all else that renders life desirable, were
vain! without that—all her enc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anting qualities, with
which nothing can vie, and which are entwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed around
my heart-string<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, were ineffectual to my peace.”</P>
<P>“You are right,” said the Doctor, and your time∣ly
caution, and early wisdom, will protect you from
the bitterness of a personal experience like mine. With
all the charms she assembles, her character seems too
unstable for private domestic life. When a few years
more have blunted the wild vivacity, the floating am∣bition,
the changing propensities which now render
her inconsistent to others, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uating even to her∣self,
she may yet become as respectable, as she must
always be amiable. B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t now,.… whoever takes
her from the circle in which she is playing, will see
her lost to all gaiety, though without daring to com∣plain,
from the restraint of bidden duties, which make
the bidder a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yrant.</P>
<P>Edgar shrunk from such a part, and immediately pre∣pared
for his long projected tour.</P>
<P>He had, originally, purposed visiting Mr. Tyrold
before he set out, and conversing with him upon the
state of danger in which he thought his daughter;
but his tenderness for her feelings, during his last
adi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, had beg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled him of this plan, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t it should
prove painful, injurious, or inauspicious to her own
views or designs in breaking to her friends their breach.
He now addressed a few lines to his revered guardian,
to be delivered by Dr. Marchmont; to whom he gave
discretionary powers, if any explanation should be de∣manded;
though clogged with an earnest clause, that
he would neither advance, nor confess any thing that
could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urt Camilla, even a moment, unless to avert
from her some danger, or substantiate some good.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont determined to accompany him to
the Isle of Wight, whither he resolved to go, and wait
for his baggage; and undertook the superintendance
of his estate and affairs in his absence.</P>
<P>When they were summoned to the little vessel,
Edgar changed colour, his heart beat quick, and he
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighed rather than breathed. He h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld his hand upon
his eyes and forehead for a few minutes, in ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny in∣expressible,
then silently gave his servant the letter he
had written for Eugenia, took the Doctor by the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,
walked to the beech, and got aboard; his head <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
turned wholly towards the town, his eyes looking above
it, as if seeking to fix the habitation of Camilla. Dr.
Marchm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt sought to draw his attention another way,
but it was rivetted to the spot they were quitting.</P>
<P>“I feel truly your unhappiness, my dear Mandle∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt,”
said he, “that this young creature, with de∣fects
of so cruel a tendency, mingles qualities of so
endearing a nature. Judge, however, the predomi∣nance
of what is fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lty, since parents so exemplary
have not been able to make the scales weigh down on
the side of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight. Alas! Mr. Tyrold has himself erred,
in committing, at so early a period, her conduct into
her own reins. The very virtues, in the first youth,
are so little regulated by reflection, were they not watch∣ed
nor aided, they run into extremes nearly as perni∣cious,
though not so unamiable as the vices. What
instance more than this now before us can shew the
futility of education, and the precariousness of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate
worth, when the contaminating world is allowed to
seize its inexperienced prey, before the character is
fixed as well as formed?”</P>
<P>A deeply assenting sigh broke from the bosom of
Edgar, whose strained eyes held their purpose, till
neither beach, nor town, nor even a spire of South∣ampton,
were discernible. Again, then, for a mo∣ment,
he covered them with his hand, and exclaimed:
“Farewell! Camilla, farewell!”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A modest Request.</HEAD>
<P>QUICK, though without a wish of speed, was
the return home of Camilla; she felt at this moment
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
in that crushed and desolate state, where the sudden
extinction of hope leaves the mind without energy to
form even a wish. She was quick only because too
nervous to be slow, and hurried on, so little knowing
why, that when she came to Mrs. Berlinton's, she was
running to her own room, wholly forgetting what had
called her from Eugenia, till the servant said, “this
is the man, ma'am.”</P>
<P>She then saw, parading up and down the hall, a
figure wrapt round in a dark blue roquelo, with
no part of his face visible, from the flaps of his
hat.</P>
<P>At another time she might have been startled: but
she was now indifferent to every thing, and only en∣quired
what was his business.</P>
<P>He made no answer but by a low bow, pointing, at
the same time to the door of one of the parlours, and
then, in a supplicating manner, putting together his
hands, as if begging to speak to her in private.</P>
<P>Careless, rather than courageous, she was going
into an empty room with him, when the servant
whispered her to be upon her guard, as the man had
a very suspicious look.</P>
<P>Stopping short, then, she again repeated her questi∣on,
adding, “I can hear any thing you have to say
say where we now are.”</P>
<P>The stranger shook his head, with a motion to∣wards
the servant, that seemed to demand his ab∣sence.</P>
<P>Alas! thought she, it is some gentleman in distress,
who wants to beg and is ashamed. I have nothing to
give him! I will, at least, therefore, not insist upon
his exposing himself. She then whispered the foot∣man
to keep in the hall, and near the parlour, which
she entered, telling the incognito<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he might fol∣low.</P>
<P>But she was seriously alarmed out of her apathy,
upon seeing him cautiously shut the door, and se∣dulously
examine the apartment.</P>
<P>She wanted not presence of mind, when not
robbed of it by some peculiar and poignant feelings.
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
She turned immediately to the bell, certain its
first touch would bring in the footman: but,
perceiving her purpose, the stranger seized her by
the arm, and in a hoarse low voice said: “Are you
mad, Camilla? don't you know me?” and the re∣cognized
her brother.</P>
<P>She expostulated upon his having so causelessly
terrified her, and enquired why he came so dis∣guised.</P>
<P>He laughed heartily at her affright, and extolled
his own skill in personating a subtle ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian; de∣claring
he liked to have a touch at all trades, in
case of accidents.</P>
<P>“And have you come hither, Lionel, only for
this foolish and very unpleasant trick?</P>
<P>“O no, my dear! this was only for my open∣ing.
I have an hundred smart freaks in my head,
any one of them worth a little trip to Southamp∣ton.
Besides, I wanted to know what you were
about. How does a certain master Edgar Mandle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bert
do? Don't blush, child. What a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
rogue you have been! hey ho? Tears?—My dear
Camilla! what's all this?”</P>
<P>She entreated him to make his enquiries of
Eugenia.</P>
<P>“Well, you took me in, I promise you. I fully
thought the young baronet had been the man.
And, really he's as fine a fellow as I ever saw.”</P>
<P>“Do not speak of him, I beg! O Lionel!—i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
you knew—” She was going to say, how through
your means, that affair has injured me—but she
checked complaints which she now regarded as
useless, and therefore degrading; and, wiping her
eyes, asked if he had yet considered the large sum,
for the obligation of which he had made her seem
responsible to Sir Sedley, whom she should not
know how ever to meet, nor consequently, how
ever to visit in the county, till some payment, if
not made, were at least arranged.</P>
<P>“Pho, pho, my dear child, don't be so Vellum∣like;
you'll be fit for nothing, soon, but to file bills
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
and score accounts. What's two hundred to him?
Hang him! I wish 'twere as much again—I hate
making a fuss about nothing. But come, tell me
something to raise my spirits—I am horribly me∣lancholy.
I've some notion of making a little
sport here with Miss Sca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-crow, How does she go
on? Waspish as ever?”</P>
<P>“Do tell me, seriously, Lionel, what is it has
brought you hither?</P>
<P>“Two things, my dear. The first of which is
the pleasure of seeing you; and the second is a lit∣tle
amusement I propose myself with old Dr. Hic,
Haec, Hoc. I find Clermont's had rare sport with
him already. It's duced unlucky I did not come
sooner.”</P>
<P>“Clermont? When did you see Clermont?</P>
<P>“Don't be curious, child. I never encourage
curiosity. It always leads to disagreeable questions.
You may tell me any thing you please, but ask no∣thing.
That's my manner of dealing with little
girls. How did you like my sending the Major to
you? Was not that good fudge? What do you look
so grave for, my dear? You're enough to give one
the vapours.”</P>
<P>Camilla attempted not to rally; she felt pierced
as by a poignard at the very fight of Lionel. The
debt he had made her contract with Sir Sedley, the
secrecy it exacted, the correspondence it had drawn
on, the cruel circumstances it had produced, and
the heart-breaking event to which it had, ultimate∣ly,
led, made his view excite sensations too corro∣sive,
and reflections too bitter, for any enjoyment
of a gaiety, which her utmost partiality could not
disentangle from levity the most unfeeling.</P>
<P>“Come, come, for pity's sake, be a little less
stupid, I conjure you. How terribly you want a
good shaking! shall I give you one? by the way,
you have never thanked me for sending you that
smart young tinker. You are horribly ungrateful
to all my tender care to provide you a good spouse.
What! not a smile? Not one dear little dimple for
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
all my rattle? Nay then, if that's the case, let's to
business at once. Any thing is better than mawk∣ishness.
I always preferred being flogged for a
frolic, to being told I was a good boy, at the ex∣pence
of sitting still, and learning my lesson.”</P>
<P>“And what business, my dear Lionel? Have you
really any?</P>
<P>“O yes, always; nobody has more; only I do it
so briskly, people always suppose it nothing but
pleasure. However, just at this minute, I am
really in rather an ugly dilemma. You know, my
dear girl, there is a certain little rather awkward
affair of mine, which I once hinted to you.”—</P>
<P>“Lionel, I hope, at least,”——</P>
<P>“O, none of your hopes with that grave face!
Hope, with a grave face, always means fear. Now,
as I am already half shoes over in the slough of
despond, 'twill be horrid ungenerous to poke me
still lower.”</P>
<P>Camilla now began to tremble, and would ask
no questions—Lionel, when he had silenced her,
seemed at a loss how to proceed; he walked about
the room with quick jerks, opened and shut the
window, seated himself upon every chair, and
every table; and then, in a half passion, said: “so
you don't want to hear any more? and you don't
care a fig if I'm hanged or drowned?”</P>
<P>“My spirits are not high, my dear Lionel; and
my head is full, and my heart is oppressed: if you
have any thing, therefore, important to say, speak,
I beg without trifling.”</P>
<P>“Nay, there's nothing new; so don't look fright∣ened;
it's all the same old story.”</P>
<P>“You continue, then, that dark, mysterious
connexion? O brother!”</P>
<P>“Why she's so pretty! so monstrous pretty!
besides, she doats upon me. You don't half con∣ceive
what a pretty fellow I am, Camilla. A sister
never knows how to judge a man. All the women
like me prodigiously.”</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133"/>
“Indeed, Lionel, you take an undue advantage
of my affection. I must seriously insist that you
mention this subject to me no more.”</P>
<P>“I don't intend it. I intend to finish with this
once—provided you do me one last good turn.
Will you, now? Come, don't be queer.”</P>
<P>“I will do nothing, absolutely nothing in so
improper—so shocking a business. Indeed, I know
not how to forgive you for naming it again.”</P>
<P>“Well, then, I'll pledge you my word and ho∣nour
you shall never hear of it more, if you'll only
grant me this one favour.”</P>
<P>Displeased at the past, and frightened for what
might be to come, she protested she would immedi∣ately
leave the room, if he continued this persecu∣tion:
adding “how affectionately I love you, I
need not, I am sure, say; but a con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idence such as
this, from a brother to a sister, disgraces us both:
and let me penetrate, but not irritate you, if I own,
that I much doubt whether I ought not from the
beginning, to have revealed this transaction at
Etherington. Do not be angry Lionel: has not
every consideration been surmounted by the fear of
giving you pain?”</P>
<P>Finding he still would be heard, she was peremp∣torily
quitting the room; but when she had her
hand upon the door, he effectually stopped her, by
saying, “Nay, then, if nothing will content you
but getting the whole out at once, you may make
yourself easy, the business is at end, for——we're
blown!”</P>
<P>“I must certainly be glad if such a business is at
an end, Lionel; but how do you mean blown? to
whom? in what manner?</P>
<P>“To every body, I'm afraid; for the husband's
upon the point of getting at it.”</P>
<P>“Husband?”</P>
<P>“O, the deuce! I did not mean to say that: how∣ever,
it's out! and as it must have been known
sooner or later”——</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134"/>
Camilla had now an air the nearest to severity
she had ever worn: “Adieu, Lionel!” she cried,
“I am sorry for you, indeed; but you must find
another hearer for this guilty history.—I will lis∣ten
to no more!”</P>
<P>Lionel now detained her by force. “How can
you take up the thing so wrong,” said he; “when
I tell you it's over, isn't that enough? Besides, I
promise you I have not wanted for my punishment:
when you hear all, you'll find that.”</P>
<P>Too sick for speech, yet too weak for resistance,
she was constrained to return to her seat, and hear
what he pleased to relate.</P>
<P>“My adventure, my dear, was discovered entire∣ly
by the want of a little hush money. 'Tis the
very deuce and all for a man to be in love when
he is poor. If I had only had a little hush money—
yes, yes, I understand that eye! but as to those pal∣try
sums I have had, from time to time, since this
affair, why they could not be expected to last for
ever: And the first went to a house-maid,—and
the second to the groom,—and the third.”——</P>
<P>“Lionel! Lionel! is this a communication—are
these particulars for me?”</P>
<P>“Nay, I only mention it to let you know it's all
gone fairly. Besides, as to her being a married
woman, which, I see, is what you think so much
the worst of all, I assure you, if you knew
her husband, you would not wonder; he de∣serves
every thing. Such a tiresome quiz! it
was often hours before we could get rid of
him. You never knew such a blockhead. The
poor thing can't bear him<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But she's fond of me
to distraction. Nay, nay, don't frown so! If you'll
believe me, Camilla, you'll quite spoil your face.
Well, the fellow that threatens to betray us,
won't keep our secret under three hundred pounds!
There's an unconscionable knave! However I
thought that better than a trial too; not that she
would have broken her heart at a separation, you'll
believe; but then … there's a certain horrid thing
called damages! And then my father's particulari∣ties,—and
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
my mother's seeing things in such
strong lights—and a parson's son,—and all that.”—</P>
<P>Camilla, shaking and pale, now entreated him to
get her a glass of water, and, for a while, at least,
to forbear continuing this terrible story.</P>
<P>He consented to ring for the water, and then,
more briefly, went on.</P>
<P>“Finding it vain to hope any longer for entire
concealment, I thought a private discovery less
shocking than a public one; and therefore, telling
my story as well as I could I stated that three hun∣dred
pounds would save both the expences and
publicity of a trial; and, with every possible pro∣fession
of contrition and reformation, I humbly
petitioned for that sum from my uncle.”</P>
<P>“My poor uncle! alas! what unreasonable—unmerciful
claims every way surround him!”</P>
<P>“He's well revenged for mine, I promise you!
There's no plague lost between us, as you'll own,
when you've heard the end of my poor petiti∣on.
I followed up my letter, according to my
usual custom, the next day, in order to receive my
money, knowing poor uncle hates writing worse
than giving: well, and when I arrived, my mind
just made up to a few gentle reprimands against
naughtiness, and as many gentle promises to do so
no more; out pops me the old butler, and says his
master can't see me! Not see me? Why, who's
with him? Your father, sir! O, then for your life,
cries I, don't say I have been here—but now—now
Camilla will you think me punished or not?—My
uncle had a little go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in his right-hand, and had
made my father open and read—that very day,—all
his letters! If ever you knew old Nick serve a
poor young fellow a worse turn than that, tell me
so? I owe him such a grudge for it, I could almost
find in my heart to turn parson myself.”</P>
<P>Camilla could not utter a word. She dropt her
head over her folded arms upon the table, to hide
her offending brother from her sight, whom now,
placed in opposition to her all-excellent father, she
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
blamed beyond her powers, beyond what she con∣ceived
even her rights of expression.</P>
<P>“Why now, my dear Camilla, what do you hide
your face for? Do you think I'm not as sorry for
this thing as you can be for the life of you; How∣ever,
now comes the worst; and if you don't pity
me when you hear this, you may depend upon it
you have no bowels. I was making off as fast as I
could, mum the word to the servants, when in
comes old Jacob with a letter. I snatched it from
him, hoping my uncle had privately sent me a
draft—but the direction was written by my father!
Don't you begin to feel a little for me now?”</P>
<P>She could only raise her head to ejuculate, “My
poor—poor father!” and then, nearly in an agony,
dropt it again.</P>
<P>“Hey-day, Camilla? how's this? what! not
one word of poor, poor brother, too? why you
are harder than flint. However, read that letter.
And then, if you dont think me the most unhappy
young fellow in existence, you are fit to devise
tortures for the inquisition.”</P>
<P>She took the letter eagerly, yet awfully, kissed
in weeping the hand-writing, and read what fol∣lows:</P>
<Q><HI>To</HI> LIONEL TYROLD, <HI>Esq.</HI></Q>
<P>To have brought up my family with the purity

known; how grossly they have failed has reached
my own knowledge but this moment. I here re∣sign

<P>Camilla stopt, sunk upon her knees, and devout∣ly
repeated the last sentence, with her own ardent
supplications joined to it, before she could proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"/>
A few words more must, for the present, suffice
between us. Accident, by throwing into my hands
this last letter to the uncle whose goodness you have
most unwarrantably and unfeelingly abused, has given
birth to an investigation, by which I have arrived at
the discovery of the long course of rapacity by which
you have pillaged from the same source. Henceforth,
you will find it dry. I have stated to my brother the
mistake of his compliance, and obtained his solemn
word, that all intercourse between you, that has not
my previous approbation, shall here finally cease. You

which, but for you, have only been opened to the

her daughters just opening into life, by my folli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
and indiscretions I have driven my mother—by my
guilt I shall make her blush to return to them?—</P>
<P>Camilla wept over this letter till its characters
were almost effaced by her tears. To withhold from
her father the knowledge of the misconduct of Lio∣nel,
what had she not suffered? what not sacrificed?
yet to find it all unavailing, to find him thus inform∣ed
of his son's wanton calls for money, his culpable
connection, and his just fears of seeing it published
and punished,——and to confider with all this, that
Edgar, through these unpardonable deviations from
right, was irretrievably lost to her, excited sorrow
the most depressing for her father, and regrets scarce
supportable for herself.</P>
<P>“Well,” cried Lionel, “what do you think of
my case now? Don't you allow I pay pretty hand∣somely
for a mere young man's gambol? I assure you
I don't know what might have been the consequence,
if Jacob had not afforded me a little comfort. He
told me you were going to be married to 'squire
Mandleb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and that you were all at Southton, and
that he was sure you would do any thing in the world
to get me out of jeopardy; and so, thinking pretty
much the same myself, here I am! Well, what say
you, Camilla? Will you speak a little word for me
to Edgar?”</P>
<P>Shame, now taking place of affliction, stopt her
tears, which dried upon her burning cheeks, as she
answered, “He is well known to you, Lionel:—
you can address him yourself!”</P>
<P>“No; that's your mistake, my dear. I have a
little odd money matter to settle with him already;
and besides, we have had a fort of a falling out upon
the subject; for when I spoke to him about it last,
he gave himself the airs of an old justice of the
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
peace, and said if he did not find the affair given up,
nothing should induce him ever to help me again.
What a mere codger that lad has turned out!”</P>
<P>“Ah, noble Edgar! just, high-principled, and
firm!” half pronounced Camilla, while again the
the icicles dissolved, and trickled down her face.</P>
<P>“See but the different way in which things strike
people! however, it is not very pretty in you, Ca∣milla,
to praise him for treating me so s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urvily. But
come, dost think he'll lend me the money?”</P>
<P>“Lend,” repeated she, significantly.</P>
<P>“Ay lend; for I shall pay it every farthing; and
every thing else.”</P>
<P>“And how? And when?”</P>
<P>“Why,—with old unky Relvil's fortune.”</P>
<P>“For shame, brother!”</P>
<P>“Nay, nay, you know as well as I do, I must
have it at last. Who else has he to leave it to? Come,
will you beg the three hundred for me? He dare not
refuse you, you know, in your day of power.”</P>
<P>“Lionel,” cried she, with extreme emotion, “I
shall see him no more! nor, perhaps may you!—He
has left England.”</P>
<P>“Impossible! why Jacob told me unky was work∣ing
night and day at preparations for your keeping
the wedding at Cleves?”</P>
<P>“I cannot talk upon this subject. I must be∣seech
you to reserve your enquiries for Eugenia”</P>
<P>“I must go to her then, directly. I have not a
moment to lose. If you won't make Edgar help me
in this business—and I know he won't do it of his
own accord, I am utterly done up. There will re∣main
but one single thing for me. So now for my
roquelo. But do only tell me, Camilla, if you ever
knew such a poor unlucky wight? for before I came
to you, certain it would not be easy to make that
young prig do any thing he had already declared
against, I found out cousin Clermont. What a hand∣some
coxcomb that is! Well, I told him my case,
for one young fellow soon comprehends the difficul∣ties,
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
of another, and begged him to ask for the mo∣ney
of uncle Hugh, as if for himself, telling him,
that as he was a new comer, and a new beginner, he
could not so readily be refused; and promising to
serve him as good a turn myself, when he had got a
little into our ways, and wanted it, with my good
uncle Relvil. Well! what do you think was the
next news? It's enough to make a man's hair stand
an end, to see what a spite fortune has taken to me!
Do you know he has got debts of his own, of one
sort or another, that poor unky has never heard of,
to the amount of upwards of a thousand pounds.”</P>
<P>He then muffled himself up and departed.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Self-dissection.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA remained in a state of accumulated
distress, that knew not upon what object most to
dwell: her father, shocked and irritated beyond the
mild endurance of his character; her brother, wan∣tonly
sporting with his family's honour, and his own
morals and reputation; her uncle, preparing for n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣tials
broken off without his knowledge; Edgar, by
a thousand perversities of accident, of indiscretion,
of misunderstanding, for ever parted from her;—
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ushed all together upon her mind, each combating
for precedence, each individually foiled, yet all col∣lectively
triumphant. Nor were even these her sole
subjects of affliction: yet another cause was added,
in debts contracted from mingled thoughtlessness, in∣experience,
and generosity, augmented to she knew
not what sum, and to be paid by she knew not what
means. And this topic, which in itself seemed to
her the least interesting, soon, by the circumstances
with which it was connected, grew the most pressing
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
of any. How, at a moment like this, could she
make her purposed confession to her father, whose
wounded mind demanded all she could offer of con∣dolement?
How call upon her uncle to be responsible
for what she owed, when she now knew the enormous
accounts preparing for him from Clermont, of which
he was himself yet uninformed?</P>
<P>Lionel soon returned. “So it's really all off?”
he cried; “dame Fortune, methinks, has a mind
to give me a taste of her art that I shan't easily for∣get.
Eugenia would tell me no particulars. But,
since things are thus, there is only one step left for
poor Pilgarlick. I must whisk over to the Conti∣nent.”</P>
<P>“To the Conti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent? without consulting my fa∣ther?
without—”</P>
<P>“My father?—Why, you see he gives me up.
He thinks—I thank him!—a little wholesome dis∣cipline
will do me good. Don't you understand what
he means by <HI>seclusion from the world?</HI> A prison, my
dear! a gaol! However, I'm not quite of that opi∣nion.
I really think a man's as well off in a little
open air. So fare thee well child. As soon as ever
my dear uncle Relvil says good night, I'll come
home again, and wish you all good morning.”</P>
<P>“Lionel! Lionel!—”</P>
<P>“Well, well! I know it's very wrong, and all
that; so say nothing. Dont't distress me, I beg,
for I hate to be hipped. Besides, old Relvil don't
deserve much better; why can't he behave like a
man, and settle an annuity upon himself, and an old
servant, and a dog, and a cat, and a parrot, and then
let an honest young fellow see a little of the world
handsomely, and like a gentleman? But your bache∣lor
uncles, and maiden aunts, are the most tantalizing
fellows and fellowesses in the creation.”</P>
<P>He then kissed her, and was going; but, earnestly
detaining him, she conjured that he would let her
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
first hint his design to their father, that at least it
might be set aside, if it would still more deeply dis∣turb
him.</P>
<P>“No child, no; I know his way of reasoning
already. He thinks every man should pay for what
he owes, either with money or stripes. Now my poor
dear little body is not of that opinion. And what
would they get by having me shut up in prison? And
I'll defy 'em to cast me in any other damages. I've a
few debts, too of my own, that make me a little un∣easy.
I don't mean to trades people; they can wait
well enough; our credit is good: but a man looks
horrid small, walking about, when he can't pay his
debts of honour. However, when I disappear, per∣haps
my father will take compassion upon my character.
If not, the Relvil estate shall wipe off all in the long
run.”</P>
<P>“And is it possible, Lionel, thus lightly, thus
negligently, thus unmoved, you can plan such a jour∣ney?
such an exile?”</P>
<P>“Why what can I do? what can I possibly do?
I am obliged to be off in my own defence. Unless,
indeed, I marry little Miss Dennel, which I have
once or twice thought of; for she's a monstrous fool.
But then she is very rich. How should you like her
for a sister? Nay, nay, I'm serious. Don't shake your
head as if I was joking. What do you think of her
for my spouse?”</P>
<P>“She is a good girl, I believe, Lionel, though a
simple one; and I should be sorry to see her unhappy:
and how could either of you be otherwise, with con∣tempt
such as this?”</P>
<P>“Bless thy heart, my little dear, what have hus∣bands
and wives to do with making one another un∣happy?
Prithee don't set about forming thy notions of
married people from the parsonage-house, and conclude
a wife no better than a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal rib, sticking always close
to a man's side. You grow so horrid sententious, I
really begin to believe you intend to take out your
diploma soon, and put on the surplice my father
meant for his poor son.”</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143"/>
“Alas, Lionel!—how changed, how hard—for∣give
me if I say how hard must you be grown, to be
capable of gaiety and rattle at this period!”</P>
<P>“You'll die an old maid, Camilla, take my word
for it. And I'm really sorry, for you're not an ugly
girl. You might have been got off. But come, don't
look so melancholy at a little silly sport. The world
is so full of sorrow, my dear girl, so little visited by
happiness, that chearfulness is almost as necessary as
existence, in such a vale of tears.”</P>
<P>“What can induce you to laugh, Lionel, at such
words?”</P>
<P>“I can't help it, faith! I was thinking I spoke so
like a parson's son!”</P>
<P>Camilla cast up her eyes and hands:</P>
<P>“Lionel, she cried, what have you done with your
heart? has it banished every natural seeling? has the
affecting letter of the best of fathers, his cruel separa∣tion
from the most excellent of mothers, and even your
own dreadfully censu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able conduct, served but to
amuse you with ridicule and derision?”</P>
<P>“Camilla,” cried he, taking her hands, “you
wrong me! you think I have no feeling, because I
am not always crying. However, shall I tell you the
truth? I hate myself! and so completely hate myself
at this moment, that I dare not be grave! dare not
suffer reflection to take hold of me, left it should
make life too odious for me to bear it. I have run on
from folly to wickedness for want of thought; and now
thought is ready to come back, I must run from that,
for want of fortitude. What has bewitched me, I
know no more than you; but I never meant to play
this abominable part. And now, if I did not flog up
my spirits to prevent their flagging, I suppose I should
hang or drown. And, believe me, if I were condemned
to the galleys, I should think it less than I deserve;
for I hate myself, I repeat—I honour my father, though
I have used him so ill; I love my mother,—for all
her deuced severity,—to the bottom of my soul; I
would cut off my left arm for Lavinia and Eugenia;
and for thee, Camilla, I would lop off my right!—But
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
yet, when some frolic or gambol comes into my
way, I forget you all! clear out my memory you all
walk, as if I had never beheld you!”</P>
<P>Camilla now embraced him with a deluge of tears,
entreated him to forgive the asperity his seeming
want of all feeling had drawn from her, and frequently
to write to her, and acquaint her how he went on, and
send his direction for her answers; that so, at least,
their father might know how he employed himself,
and have the power to give him counsel.</P>
<P>“But how, my poor Lionel,” she added, “how
will you live abroad? How will you even travel?”</P>
<P>“Why as to how I shall live there, I don't know;
but as well as I deserve easily: however, as to how
I shall get there, look here,” taking from his pocket
a handful of guineas, “that little good Eugenia has
given me every thing, even to the last half crown,
that she had at Southampton, to help me forward.”</P>
<P>“Dear excellent, ever generous Eugenia! O that
I could follow her example! but alas! I have no∣thing!—and
worse than nothing!!</P>
<P>They then affectionately embraced each other, and
and parted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Reckoning.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT Camilla experienced at this juncture she
believed inadmissible of aggravation. Even the break∣ing
off with Edgar seemed as a new misfortune from
the new force which circumstances gave to its afflic∣tion.
With his sympathising aid, how might she have
softened the sorrows of her father! how have broken
the shock of the blow Clermont was preparing for her
uncle? But now instead of lessening their griefs, she
must herself inflict upon them a heavier evil than any
they had yet suffered. And how could she reveal
tidings for which they were so wholly unprepared?
<PB N="144" REF="145"/>
how be even intelligible in the history, without ex∣posing
the guilty Lionel beyond all chance of pardon?</P>
<P>Again she went to counsel with Eugenia, who, with
her usual disinterested affection, proposed taking the
painful business upon herself at their return home.
Camilla, with tears of gratitude accepted the sisterly
office, and resolved to devote the rest of her short time
for Southampton to Mrs. Berlinton; who, shocked to
see her evident unhappiness, hung over her with the
most melting tenderness: bewailing alike the disap∣pointment
of Eugenia, and the conduct of her brother;
who now, with exquisite misery, shut himself wholly
up in his room.</P>
<P>This compassionate kindness somewhat softened her
anguish; but when the engagements of Mrs. Berlinton
called her away, Mrs. Mittin burst briskly into her
chamber.</P>
<P>“Well, my dear,” cried she, “I come with bet∣ter
news now than ever! only guess what it is!”</P>
<P>Nothing could less conduce to the tranquillity of
Camilla than such a desire; her conjectures always
flowed into the channels of her wishes; and she thought
immediately that Mrs. Mitten had been informed of
her situation, and came to her with some intelligence
of Edgar.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten, after keeping her a full quarter of an
hour in suspence, at last said: “Do you know Miss
Dennel's going to be married?—though she was fifteen
only yesterday!—and I am invited to the wedding?”</P>
<P>No surprise had ever yet produced less pleasure to
Camilla, who now ceased to listen, though Mrs.
Mitten by no means ceased to speak, till her attention
was awakened by the following sentence: So, as I
am to go to town, to shop with her, at her own papa's
desire, you can give me the money, you know, my
dear, and I can pay off your Tunbridge bills for you.”</P>
<P>She then took out of her pockets some accounts,
which, she said, she had just received; though, in
fact, they had been in her possession more than a week;
but till the invitation of Miss Dennel called her so
pleasantly away, she had thought it prudent to keep
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
every motive in reserve, that added importance to her
stay.</P>
<P>Camilla, with the utmost apprehension, took the
papers into her hands: they were the bills from Tun∣bridge,
of the milliner, she shoe-maker, the haber∣dasher,
and the glover, and amounted altogether to
sixteen pounds.</P>
<P>The chief articles had been nearly forced upon her
by Mrs. Mittin, with assurances of their cheapness,
and representations of their necessity, that, joined to
her entire ignorance of the enormous charges of fashion,
had led her to imagine four or five guineas the utmost
sum at which they could be estimated.</P>
<P>What now, then, was her horror! if to sixteen
pounds amounted the trifles she had had at Tunbridge,
what calculation must she make of articles, so infinitely
more valuable, that belonged to her debts at Southamp∣ton?
And to whom now could she apply? The un∣happy
situation of her father was no longer an only
reason to forbear such a call upon him: Lionel, still
under age, was flying the kingdom with debts, which,
be they small as they might, would, to Mr. Tyrold's
limited income, be as heavy as the more considerable
ones of her cousin upon Sir Hugh; yet who besides
could give her aid? Eugenia, whose yearly allow∣ance,
according to her settled future fortune, was five
times that of her sisters, had given what help she had
in her power, before she quitted Cleves, upon the
affair of the horse; and all that remained of a con∣siderable
present made for her Southampton expedition
by her uncle, who in every thing distinguished her
as his successor and heiress, she had just bestowed
upon Lionel, even, as he had declared, to her last
half-crown. Mrs. Berlinton, whose tender friendship
might, in this emergence, have encouraged solicita∣tion,
was involved in debts of honour, and wanted
money for herself; and to Mrs. Arlbery, her only
other acquaintance rich enough to give assistance, and
with whom she was intimate enough to ask it, she al∣ready
owed five guineas; and how in conscience or
decency, could she address her for so much more,
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
when she saw before her no time, no term, upon
which she could fix for restitution?</P>
<P>In this terrible state, with no one to counsel her,
and no powers of self-judgment, she felt a dread
of going home, that rendered the coming day a
day of horror, though to a home to which, hither∣to,
she had turned as the first joy of her happiness,
or softest solace of any disturbance. Her filial
affections were in their pristine force; her short
commerce with the world had robbed them of
none of their vivacity; her regard for Edgar,
whom she delighted to consider as a younger Mr.
Tyrold, had rather enlarged than divided them;
but to return a burthen to an already burthened
house, an affliction to an already afflicted parent—“No!”
she broke out, aloud, “I cannot go
home!—I cannot carry calamity to my father!—He
will be mild—but he will look unhappy; and
I would not see his face in sorrow—sorrow of my
own creating—for years of after joy!”</P>
<P>She threw herself down upon the bed, hid her
face with the counterpane, and wept, in desperate
carelessless of the presence of Mrs. Mittin, and an∣swering
nothing that she said.</P>
<P>In affairs of this sort, Mrs. Mittin had a quick∣ness
of apprehension, which, though but the
attribute of ready cunning, was not inferior to the
keenest penetration, possessed, for deeper investiga∣tions,
by characters of more solid sagacity. From
the fear which Camilla, in her anguish, had ut∣tered
of seeing her father, she gathered, there must
be some severe restriction in money concerns; and,
without troubling herself to consider what they
might be, saw that to aid her at this moment
would be the highest obligation; and immediately
set at work a brain as fertile in worldly expedi∣ents,
as it was barren of intellectual endowments,
in forming a plan of present relief, which she con∣cluded
would gain her a rich and powerful friend
for life.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148"/>
She was not long in suggesting a proposition,
which Camilla started up eagerly to hear, almost
breathless with the hope of any reprieve to her
terrors.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, amongst her numerous friends,
counted a Mr. Clykes, a money-lender, a man, she
said, of the first credit for such matters with people
of fashion in any difficulty. If Camilla, therefore,
would collect her debts, this gentleman would pay
them, for a handsome premium, and handsome
interest, till she was able, at her own full leisure,
to return the principal, with a proper present.</P>
<P>Camilla nearly embraced her with rapture for
this scheme. The premium she would collect as
she could, and the interest she would pay from her
allowance, certain that when her uncle was cleared
from his embarrassments, her own might be re∣vealed
without any serious distress. She put,
therefore, the affair wholly into the hands of Mrs.
Mittin, besought her, the next morning, to de∣mand
all her Southampton bills, to add to them
those for the rent and stores of Higden, and then to
transact the business with Mr. Clykes; promising
to agree to whatever premium, interest, and pre∣sent,
he should demand, with endless acknowledg∣ments
to herself for so great a service.</P>
<P>She grieved to employ a person so utterly disa∣greeable
to Edgar; but to avert immediate evil
was ever resistless to her ardent mind.</P>
<P>The whole of the Southampton accounts were
brought her early the next morning by the active
Mrs. Mittin, who now concluded, that what she
had conceived to be covetousness in Camilla, was
only the fear of a hard tyrant of a father, who
kept her so parsimoniously, that she could allow
herself no indulgence, till the death of her uncle
should endow her with her own rich inheritance.</P>
<P>Had this arrangement not taken place before the
arrival of the bills, Camilla, upon beholding them,
thought she should have been driven to complete
distraction. The ear-rings and necklace, silver
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
fringes and spangles, feathers, nosegay, and shoe-roses,
with the other parts of the dress, and the
fine Valencienne edging, came to thirty-three
pounds. The cloak also, that cheapest thing in
the world, was nine guineas; and various small
articles, which Mrs. Mittin had occasionally brought
in, and others with which Camilla could not dis∣pense,
came to another five pounds. To this, the
rent for Higden added eighteen; and the bill of
stores, which had been calculated at thirty, was
sent in at thirty-seven.</P>
<P>The whole therefore, with the sixteen pounds
from Tunbridge, amounted to one hundred and
eighteen pounds nine shillings.</P>
<P>Struck to the very soul with the idea of what she
must have endured to have presented, at such a
period, so large an account, either at Cleves or at
Etherington, she felt lifted into paradise by the
escape of this expedient, and lost sight of every
possible future difficulty, in the relief of avoiding
so severe a present penalty.</P>
<P>By this means, also, the tradesmen would not
wait; and she had been educated with so just an
abhorrence of receiving the goods, and benefiting
from the labours of others, without speeding them
their rights and their rewards, that she felt des∣picable
as well as miserable, when she possessed
what she had not repaid.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin was now invested with full powers
for the agency, which her journey to London
would give her immediate means to execute. She
was to meet Miss Dennel there in two days to assist
in the wedding purchases, and then to accompany
that young lady to her father's house in Hampshire,
whence she could visit Etherington, and finally
arrange the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ransaction.</P>
<P>Camilla, again thanking, took leave of her, to
consign her few remaining hours to Mrs. Berlinton,
who was impatient at losing one moment of the
society she began sincerely to regret she had not
more uniformly preferred to all other. As sad
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
now with cares as Camilla was with afflictions, she
had robbed her situation of nearly the only good
which belonged to it—an affluent power to gratify
every luxury, whether of generosity or personal
indulgence. Her gaming, to want of happiness,
added now want of money; and Camilla, with a
sigh, saw something more wretched, because far
deeper and more wilful in error than herself.</P>
<P>They mingled their tears for their separate per∣sonal
evils, with the kindest consolation that either
could suggest for the other, till Camilla was told
that Eugenia desired to see her in the parlour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, ashamed, yet delighted to meet
her again, went down at the same time. She em∣braced
her with fondness, but ventured not to
utter either apology or concern. Eugenia was
serious but composed, sighed often, yet both ac∣cepted
and returned her caresses.</P>
<P>Camilla enquired if Miss Margland expected
them immediately.</P>
<P>“Yes,” she answered; “but I have first a little
business of my own to transact.” Then, turning
to Mrs. Berlinton, and forcing a smile, “You
will be surprised,” she said, “to hear me ask for
.… your brother! … but I must see him be∣fore
I can leave Southampton.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton hung her head: There is cer∣tainly,”
she cried, “no reproach he does not me∣rit
… yet, if you knew … the respect … the
… the …”</P>
<P>Eugenia rang the bell, making a slight apology,
but not listening to what Mrs. Berlinton strove to
say; who, colouring and uneasy, still attempted
to utter something softening to what had passed.</P>
<P>“Be so good,” said Eugenia, when the footman
appeared, “to tell Mr. Melmond I beg to speak
with him.”</P>
<P>Camilla astonished, and Mrs. Berlinton silenced,
waited, in an unpleasant pause, the event.</P>
<P>Eugenia, absorbed in thought, neither spoke to,
nor looked at them, nor moved, till the door
<PB N="150" REF="151"/>
opened, and Melmond, who durst not refuse so
direct a summons, though he would have preferred
any punishment to obeying it, blushing, bowing,
and trembling, entered the room.</P>
<P>She then started, half heaved, and half checked
a sigh, took a folded note out of her pocket-book,
and with a faint smile, said, “I fear my desire
must have been painful to you; but you see me
now for the last time—I hope!—without any ill-will.”</P>
<P>She stopt for breath to go on; Melmond, amaz∣ed,
striving vainly to articulate one word of ex∣cuse,
one profession even of respect.</P>
<P>“Believe me, Sir,” she then continued, “surprise
was the last sensation I experienced upon a late…
transaction. My extraordinary personal defects
and deformity have been some time known to me,
though—I cannot tell how—I had the weakness or
vanity not to think of them as I ought to have
done!——But I see I give you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> uneasiness, and
therefore I will be more concise.”</P>
<P>Melmond, confounded, had bowed down his
head not to look at her, while Camilla and Mrs.
Berlinton both wept.</P>
<P>“The sentiments, Sir,” she then went on, “of
my cousin have never been declared to me; but it
is not very difficult to me to divine what they may
be. All that is certain, is the unkindness of For∣tune,
which forbids her to listen or, or you to
plead to them. This, Sir, it shall be my care”—she
stopt a moment, looking paler, and wanting
voice; but presently recovering, proceeded—“my
happiness, let me say, to endeavour to rectify. I
have much influence with my kind uncle; can I
doubt, when I represent to him that I have just
escaped making two worthy people wretched, he
will deny aiding me to make them happy? No!
the residence already intended at Cleves will still
be open, though one of its parties will be changed.
But as my uncle, in a manner unexampled, has
bound himself, in my favour, from any future dis∣position
<PB N="151" REF="152"/>
of what he possesses, I have ventured, Sir,
upon this paper, to obviate any apprehensions of
your friends, for the unhappy time when that ge∣nerous
uncle can no longer act for himself.”</P>
<P>She then unfolded, and gave him the paper,
which contained these words:</P>
<P>“I here solemnly engage myself, if Miss Indiana
Lynmere accepts, with the consent of Sir Hugh
Tyrold, the hand of Frederic Melmond, to share
with them, so united, whatever fortune or estate I
may be endowed with, to the end of my life, and
to bequeath them the same equal portion by will
after my death.</P>
<CLOSER>Signed.
<SIGNED>EUGENIA TYROLD.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Unable to read, yet conceiving the purport of
the writing, Melmond was at her feet. She endea∣voured
to raise him, and though extremely affect∣ed,
said, with an air of some pleasantry, “Shew
less surprise, Sir, or I shall conclude you thought
me as frightful within as without! But no! Pro∣vidence
is too good to make the mind necessarily
deformed with the body.”</P>
<P>“Ah, Madam! exclaimed Melmond, wholly
overcome, the noblest as well as softest of human
hearts I perceive to be yours—and were mine at
my own disposal—it must find you resistless!”—</P>
<P>“No more, no more!” interrupted she, pene∣trated
with a pleasure in these words which she
durst not indulge, “you shall hear from me soon.
Meanwhile, be Hope your motto, Friendship shall
be mine.”</P>
<P>She was then going to hold out her hand to
him; but her courage failed; she hastily embraced
Mrs. Berlinton, took the arm of Camilla, and
hurried out of the house, followed by the footman
who had attended her.</P>
<P>Melmond, who had seen the motion of her hand
now advancing, now withdrawn, would have
given the universe to have stamped upon it his
grateful reverence; but his courage was still less
<PB N="152" REF="153"/>
than her own; she seemed to him, on the sudden,
transformed to a deity, benignly employed to res∣cue
and bless him, but whose transcendent good∣ness,
he could only at a distance, and in all humi∣lity,
adore.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton was left penetrated nearly as
much as her brother, and doubtful if even the
divine Indiana could render him as happy as the
exalted, the incomparable Eugenia.</P>
<P>The two sisters found Miss Margland in extreme
ill-humour waiting their arrival, and the whole
party immediately quitted Southampton.</P>
<P>It not seldom occurred to Miss Margland to be
cross merely as a mark of consequence; but here
the displeasure was deep with herself as with others.
She had entered Southampton with a persuasion
her fair pupil would make there the establishment,
so long the promised mede of her confinement;
and Indiana herself, not knowing where to stop
her sanguine and inflated hopes, imagined that the
fame of her beauty would make the place where
it was first exhibited the resort of all of fashion in
the nation. And the opening of the scene answer∣ed
their fullest expectations: no other name was
heard but Indiana Lynmere, no other figure was
admired, no other face could bear examination.</P>
<P>But her triumph, though splendid, was short;
she soon found that the overtures of eyes were
more ready than those of speech; and though one
young baronet, enchanted with her beauty, im∣mediately
professed himself her lover, when he
was disdained, in the full assurance of higher offers,
and because a peer had addressed himself to Euge∣nia,
she saw not that he was succeeded by any
other, nor yet that he broke his own heart. Men
of taste, after the first conversation, found her
more admirable to look at than speak with; ad∣venturers
soon discovered that her personal charms
were her only dower; the common herd were re∣pulsed
from approaching her by the repulsive man∣ners
of Miss Margland; and all evinced, that
<PB N="153" REF="154"/>
though a passion for beauty was still as fashionable
as it was natural, the time was past when the
altar of Hymen required no other incense to
blaze upon it.</P>
<P>The governess, therefore, and the pupil, quit∣ted
Southampton with equal disappointment and
indignation; the first foreseeing another long and
yawning sojourn at Cleves; the second firmly be∣lieving
herself the most unaccountably ill used
person in the creation, that one offer only had
reached her, and that without repetition, though
admired nearly to adoration, she literally rather
than metaphorically conceived herself a de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣goddess.</P>
<P>One solitary offer to Eugenia, of an every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay
ruined young nobleman, though a blast both to
the settlement and the peace of Indiana, was to
herself wholly nugatory. Intent, at that period,
upon dedicating for ever to Melmond he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> virgir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
heart, she was sorry, upon his account, for the ap∣plication,
but gave it not, upon her own, a mo∣ment's
consideration. This proposition was made
upon her first arrival, and was followed by no
other. She was then, by the account given to the
master of the ceremonies by Miss Margland, re∣garded
as the heiress of Cleves: but, almost im∣mediately
after, the report spread by Mrs. Mittin,
that Camilla was the true heiress, gained such
ground amongst the shop-keepers, and thence tra∣velled
so rapidly from gossip to gossip, and house
to house, that Eugenia was soon no more thought
of; though a species of doubt was cast upon the
whole party, from the double assertion, that kept
off from Camilla, also, the fortune seekers of
the place.</P>
<P>But another rumour got abroad, that soon en∣tirely
cleared Eugenia, not merely of lovers but
acquaintances; namely, her studies with Dr. Ork∣borne.
This was a prevailing theme of spite with
Miss Margland, when the Doctor had neglected
and displeased her; and a topic always at hand for
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
her spleen, when it was angered by other circum∣stances
not so easy of blame or of mention.</P>
<P>This, shortly, made Eugenia stared at still more
than her peculiar appearance. The misses, in tit∣tering,
ran away from the learned lady; the bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
contemptuously sneering, rejoiced she was too
ugly to take in any poor fellow to marry her.
Some imagined her studies had stinted her growth;
and all were convinced her education had made her
such a fright.</P>
<P>Of the whole party, the only one who quitted
Southampton in spirits was Dr. Orkborne. He
was delighted to be no longer under the dominion
of Miss Margland, who, though she never left
him tranquil in the possession of all he valued, his
leisure, and his books and papers, eternally an∣noyed
him with reproaches upon his absence, non-attendance,
and ignorance of high life; asking
always, when angry, “If any one had ever heard
who was his grandfather?”</P>
<P>The doctor, in return, despising, like most who
have it not, whatever belonged to noble birth, re∣garded
her and her progenitors as the pest of the
human race; frequently when incensed by interrup∣tion,
exclaiming, “Where intellect is uncultivated,
what is man better than a brute, or woman than
an ideot?”</P>
<P>Nor was his return to his own room, books,
and hours, under the roof of the indulgent Sir
Hugh, the only relief of this removal; he knew
not of the previous departure of Dr. Marchmont,
and he was glad to quit a spot where he was open
to a comparison which he felt to be always to his
disadvantage.</P>
<P>So much more powerful and more prominent is
character than education, that no two men could
be more different than Dr. Marchmont and Dr.
Orkborne, though the same university had finished
their studies, and the same passion, pursuit, and
success in respect to learning, had raised and spread
their names and celebrity. The first, with all his
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
scholastic endowments, was a man of the world,
and a grace to society; the second, though in
erudition equally respectable, was wholly lost to
the general community, and alive only with his pen
and his books. They enjoyed, indeed, in common,
that happy and often sole reward of learned la∣bours,
the privilege of snatching some care from
time, some repining from misfortune, by seizing
for themselves, and their own exclusive use, the
whole monopoly of mind; but they employed it
not to the same extension. The things and people
of this lower sphere were studiously, by Dr. Ork∣borne,
sunk in oblivion by the domineering pre∣valence
of the alternate transport and toil of in∣tellectual
occupation; Dr. Marchmont, on the
contrary, though his education led to the same
propensities, still held his fellow-creatures to be of
higher consideration than their productions.
Without such extravagance in the pursuit of his
studies, he knew it the happy province of literary
occupations, where voluntary, to absorb worldly
solicitudes, and banish for a while even mental
anxieties; and though the charm may be broken
by every fresh intrusion of calamity, it unites
again with the first retirement, and, without di∣minishing
the feelings of social life, has a power,
from time to time, to set aside their sufferings.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Brides and no Brides.</HEAD>
<P>IN the hall of the Cleves mansion the party from
Southampton were received by Sir Hugh, Mr.
Tyrold, and Lavinia. The baronet greeted in par∣ticular
the two nieces he regarded as brides elect,
with an elation that prevented him from observing
their sadness; while their confusion at his mistake
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
he attributed to the mere bashfulness of their situ∣ation.
He enquired, nevertheless, with some
surprise, why the two bridegrooms did not attend
them? which, he owned, he thought rather odd;
though he supposed it might be the only new way.</P>
<P>The changing colour and starting tears of the
two sisters still escaped his kindly occupied but un∣discerning
eyes: while Mr. Tyrold, having ten∣derly
embraced, avoided looking at them from the
fear of adding to their blushes, and sat quiet and
grave, striving to alleviate his present new and
deep sorrow, by participating in the revived hap∣piness
of his brother. But Lavinia soon saw their
mutual distress, and with apprehensive affection
watched an opportunity to investigate its cause.</P>
<P>“But come,” cried Sir Hugh, “I shan't wait
for those gentlemen to shew you what I've done
for you, seeing they don't wait for me, by their
following their own way, which, however, I sup∣pose
they may be with their lawyers, none of those
gentlemen having been here, which I think rather
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low, considering the rooms are almost ready.”</P>
<P>He would now have taken them round the house;
but, nearly expiring with shame, they entreated
to be excused; and, insupportably oppressed by the
cruel discovery they had to divulge, stole apart to
consult upon what measures they should take.
They then settled that Camilla should accompany
Mr. Tyrold to Etherington, but keep off all dis∣closure
till the next morning, when Eugenia
would arrive, and unfold the sad tidings.</P>
<P>When they returned to the parlour, they found
Sir Hugh, in the innocency of his heart, had
forced Indiana, Miss Margland, and even Dr. Ork∣borne,
to view his improvements for the expected
nuptials, judging the disinterestedness of their
pleasure by his own; though to the two ladies,
nothing could be less gratifying than preparations
for a scene in which they were to bear no part,
and the Doctor thought every evil genius at work to
detain him from his study and his manuscripts.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158"/>
“But what's the oddest” cried the Baronet,
“of all, is nobody's coming for poor Indiana;
which I could never have expected, especially in
the point of taking off little Eugenia first, whom
her own cousin did not think pretty enough;
which I can never think over and above good na∣tured
in him, being so difficult. However, I hope
we shall soon forget that, now for which reason,
I forgive him.”</P>
<P>Indiana was so much piqued, she could scarce
refrain from relating the portico history at lord
Pervil's; but the Baronet, not remarking her dis∣composure,
turned to Camilla and Eugenia, smi∣lingly
exclaiming: “Well, my dear girls, I sha'n't
mention what we have been looking at in your
absence, because of your blushes, which I hope
you approve. But we shall soon, I hope, see it
all together, without any of your modesty's mind∣ing
it. I shall have to pinch a little for it the rest
of the year, which, God knows, will be a plea∣sure
to me, for the sake of my two dear girls, as
well as Mr. Edgar; not to mention the new young
gentleman; who seems a pretty kind of person
too, though he is not one of our own relations.”</P>
<P>He was rather disappointed when he found
Camilla was to go to Etherington, but desired
there might be a general meeting the next day,
when he should also invite Dr. Marchmont. “For
I think” said he, “he's as little proud as the best
dance amongst us; which makes me like him as
well. And I can't say but I was as much obliged
to him that day about the mad bull, as if he had
been one of my nephews or nieces himself: which
is what I sha'n't forget.”</P>
<P>In the way back to Etherington, Camilla could
scarce utter a word; and Lavinia, who had just
gathered from her, in a whisper “All is over
with Edgar!” with divided, but silent pity, looked
from her father to her sister, thought of her bro∣ther,
and wept for all three. Mr. Tyrold alone
was capable of any exertion. Unwilling to give
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
Camilla, whom he concluded impressed with the
thousand solicitudes of her impending change of
situation, any abrupt account of her brother's
cruel conduct, he spoke with composure though
not with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>lness, and hoped, by a general
gravity, to prepare, without alarming her, for the
ill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he must inevitably <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But he soon,
however, observed an excess of sadness upon her
countenance, far deeper than what he could attri∣bute
to the thoughts he had first suggested and
wholly different from an ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation in which though
fear bears a part, hope preponderates.</P>
<P>It now struck him that probably Lionel had
been at Southampton: for so wide was every idea
from supposing any mischief with Edgar, that,
like Sir Hugh, upon his non appearance, he had
concluded him engaged with his lawyer. But of
Melmond, less sure, he had been more open in en∣quiry,
and with inexpressible concern, for his be∣loved
and unfortunate Eugenia, gathered that the
affair was ended: though her succeding plan by her
own desire, Camilla left for her own explanation.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Etherington, taking her
into his study, “Camilla,” he said, “tell me, I
beg… do you know any thing of Lionel”</P>
<P>An unrestrained burst of tears convinced him
his conjecture was right, and he soon obtained all
the particulars of the meeting except its levity
and flightiness. Where directly questioned, no
sisterly ten lerness could induce her to filial preva∣rication;
but she rejoiced to spare her brother all
exposure that m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re silence could spare; and as Mr.
Tyrold suspected not her former knowledge of his
extravagance and ill conduct, he neither asked, nor
heard, any thing beyond the last interview,</P>
<P>At the plan of going abroad, he sighed heavily,
but would take no measures to prevent it. Lionel,
he saw was certain of being cast in any trial; and
though he would not stretch out his arm to avert
the punishment he thought deserved, he was not
sorry to change the languid waste of imprison∣ment
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
at home, for the hardships with which he
might live upon little abroad.</P>
<P>A calamity such as this seemed cause full suffici∣ent
for the distress of Camilla; Mr. Tyrold sought
no other; but though she wept, now, at liberty,
his very freedom from suspicion and enquiry in∣creased
her anguish. “Your happy fate,” cried
he, “is what most, at this moment supports me;
and to that I shall chiefly owe the support of
your mother; whom a blow such as this will more
bitterly try than the loss of our whole income,
or even than the life itself of your brother. Her
virtue is above misfortune, but her soul will shud∣der
at guilt.”</P>
<P>The horror of Camilla was nearly intolerable
at this speech, and the dreadful disappointment
which she knew yet to be awaiting her loved pa∣rents.
“Take comfort, my dearest girl,” said Mr.
Tyrold, who saw her suffering, “it is yours, for
all our sakes to be chearful, for to you we shall
owe the worthiest of sons, at the piercing juncture
when the weakest and most faulty fails us.”</P>
<P>“O my father!” she cried, “speak not such
words! Lionel himself…” she was going to say:
has made you less unhappy than you will be made
by me: but she durst not finish her phrase; she
turned away from him her streaming eyes, and stopt.</P>
<P>“My dearest child,” he cried, “let not your
rising prospects be thus dampt by this cruel event.
The connection you have formed will be a consola∣tion
to us all. It binds to us for life a character
already so dear to us; it will afford to our Lavinia,
should we leave her single, a certain asylum; it
will give to our Eugenia a counsellor that may
save her hereafter from fraud and ruin; it may
aid poor Lionel, when, some time hence, he re∣turns
to his country, to return to the right path,
whence so widely he has strayed; and it will heal
with lenient balm the wounded, bleeding bosom
of a meritorious but deeply afflicted mother!
While to your father, my Camilla…”</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161"/>
These last words were not heard; such a mention
of her mother had already overpowered her, and un∣able
to let him keep up his delusion, she supported her
shaking frame against his shoulder, and exclaimed in
a tone of agony: “O my father! you harrow me
to the soul!—Edgar has left me!—has left England!
—left us all!”——</P>
<P>Shocked, yet nearly incredulous, he insisted upon
looking at her: her countenance impelled belief. The
woe it expressed could be excited by nothing less than
the deprivation of every worldly expectation, and a
single glance was an answer to a thousand interroga∣tories.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now sat down, with an air between
calmness and despondence, saying, “And how has
this come to pass?”</P>
<P>Again she got behind him, and in a voice scarce
audible, said, Eugenia would, the next morning, ex∣plain
all.</P>
<P>“Very well, I will wait;” he quietly, but with pal∣pably
stifled emotions, answered: “Go, my love, go
to Lavinia; open to her your heart; you will find
consolation in her kindness. My own, I confess, is
now weighed down with sorrow! this last and unex∣pected
stroke will demand some time, some solitude,
to be yielded to as it ought.” He then held out to
her his hand, which she could scarcely approach from
trembling, and scarcely kiss for weeping, and added:
“I know what you feel for me—and know, too, that
my loss to yours is nothing,—for yours is not to be
estimated! you are young, however, and, with your∣self
it may pass away.… but your mother—my
heart, Camilla, is rent for your unfortunate mo∣ther!”</P>
<P>He then embraced her, called Lavinia, and retired
for the night.</P>
<P>Terribly it passed with them all.</P>
<P>The next morning, before they assembled to break∣fast,
Eugenia was in the chamber of Camilla.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162"/>
She entered with a bright beam upon her counte∣nance,
which, in defiance of the ravaging distemper
that had altered her, gave it an expression almost ce∣lestial.
It was the pure emanation of virtue, of dis∣interested,
of even heroic virtue. “Camilla,” she
cried, “all is settled with my uncle! Indiana …
you will not wonder—consents; and already this
morning I have written to Mr. Mel—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>”</P>
<P>With all her exultation, her voice faultered at the
name, and, with a faint smile, but deep blush, she
called for the congratulations of her sister upon her
speedy success.</P>
<P>“Ah, far more than my congratulations, my es∣teem,
my veneration is yours, dear and generous Eu∣genia!
true daughter of my mother! and proudest
recompence of my father!</P>
<P>She was not sufficiently serene to give any particu∣lars
of the transaction; and Mr. Tyrold soon sent for
her to his room.</P>
<P>Camilla, trembling and hanging over her, said:
“You will do for me, I know, better than I could
do for myself;—but spare poor Lionel—and be just
to Edgar!—</P>
<P>Eugenia strictly obeyed: in sparing Lionel she
spared also her father, whom his highly unfeeling be∣haviour
with regard to Sir Sedley would yet further
have incensed and grieved; and, in doing justice to
Edgar, she flattered herself she prevented an aliena∣tion
from one yet destined to be nearly allied to him,
since time, she still hoped, would effect the reconci∣liation
of Camilla with the youth whom—next to
Melmond—she thought the most amiable upon earth.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, by this means, gathered no further
intelligence than that they had parted upon some mu∣tual,
though slight dissatisfaction. He hoped, there∣fore,
with Eugenia, they might soon meet again;
and resolved, till he could better judge what might
prove the event, to keep this distress from Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>He then met Camilla with the most consolatory
kindness; yet would not trust her ardent mind with
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
the hopes he cherished himself, dreading infinitely
more to give than to receive disappointment. He
blamed her for admitting any doubts of the true re∣gard
of Edgar, in whom promise was always short
of performance, and whom he conceived displeased
by unjust suspicions, or offended by undue expecta∣tions
of professions, which the very sincerity of his
rational and manly character prevented him from
making.</P>
<P>Camilla heard in silence suggestions she could not
answer, without relating the history of Sir Sedley:
“No, Lionel, no!” she said to herself, “I will not
now betray you! I have lost all!—and now the loss
to me is irreparable, shall I blast you yet further to
my poor father, whose deepest sigh is already for
your misconduct?”</P>
<P>The story of Eugenia herself he learnt with true
admiration, and gave to her magnanimity its dearest
mede, in her mother's promised, and his own imme∣diate
approbation.</P>
<P>But Sir Hugh, notwithstanding all Eugenia could
urge in favour of Melmond, had heard her account
with grief and resentment. All, however, being ac∣tually
ready for the double wedding, he could not, he
said, answer to his conscience doing so much for the
rest, and refusing the same for Indiana, whom he
called upon to accept or reject the preparations made
for her cousin.</P>
<P>Indiana stood fluttering for a few minutes between
the exultation of being the first bride, and the mor∣tification
of marrying a man without fortune or title.
But the observation of Sir Hugh, upon the oddity
of her marrying the last, she was piqued with a most
earnest ambition to reverse. Nor did Melmond him∣self
go for nothing in this affair, as all she had of
heart he had been the first to touch.</P>
<P>She retired for a short conference with Miss Mar∣gland,
who was nearly in an equal dilemma, from
unwillingness to dispose of her beautiful pupil with∣out
a title, and from eagerness to quit Cleves, which
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
she thought a convent for dullness, and a prison for
confinement. Melmond had strongly in his favour
the received maxim amongst match-makers, that a
young lady without fortune has a less and less chance
of getting off upon every public appearance, which
they call a public failure: their joint deliberations
were, however, interrupted by an abrupt intiusion
of Molly Mill, who announced she had just heard
that Miss Dennel was going to be married.</P>
<P>This information ended the discussion. The dis∣grace
of a bridal appearance anticipated in the neigh∣bourhood
by such a chit, made Indiana hastily run
down stairs, and tell her uncle that the merit of Mel∣mond
determined her to refuse every body for his
sake.</P>
<P>A man and horse, therefore, at break of day the
next morning, was sent off by Eugenia to South∣ampton
with these words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><HI>To</HI> FREDERIC MELMOND, <HI>Es{que}</HI></OPENER>
<P>You will be welcome, Sir, at Cleves, where you
will forget, I hope, every painful sensation, in the
happiness which awaits you, and dismiss all retrospec∣tion,
to return with sincerity the serene friendship of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>EUGENIA TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now visited Cleves with only his
younger daughter, and excused the non-appearance
there, for the present, of Camilla; acknowledging
that some peculiar incidents, which he could not yet
explain, kept Mandlebert away, and must postpone
the celebration of the marriage.</P>
<P>The vexation this gave Sir Hugh, redoubled his
anxiety to break to him the evil by degrees, if to
break it to him at all should become indispensable.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Hint for Debtors.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold was well aware that to keep from
Sir Hugh the affliction of Camilla, he must keep
from him Camilla herself: for though her sighs she
could suppress, and her tears disperse, her voice
had lost its tone, her countenance its gaiety; her
eyes no longer sparkled, her very smiles betrayed
anguish. He was the last to wonder at her suffer∣ings,
for Edgar was nearly as dear to him as her∣self;
but he knew not, that, added to this annihi∣lation
of happiness, her peace was consumed by
her secret knowledge of the blows yet impending
for himself, and for her uncle. Concealment, al∣ways
abhorrent to her nature, had, till now, been
unknown even to her thoughts; and its weight,
from a species of culpability that seemed attached
to its practice, was, at times, more dreadful to
bear than the loss even of Edgar himself. The
latter blackened every prospect of felicity; but the
former, still more tremendous to the pure princi∣ples
in which she had been educated, seemed to
strike even at her innocence. The first wish of an
ingenuous mind is to anticipate even inquiry; the
feeling, therefore, that most heavily weighs it
down, is any fear of detection.</P>
<P>While they were at breakfast the following
morning, the servant brought in the name of Dr.
Marchmont.</P>
<P>Camilla felt nearly fainting. Why he was come
—whence—whether Edgar accompanied him—or
sent by him any message—whether he were return∣ed
to Beach Park—or sailed for the Continent——were
doubts that pressed so fast, and so vehemently
upon her mind, that she feared to quit the room
lest she should meet Edgar in the passage, and
feared still more to continue in it, lest Dr. March∣mont
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
should enter without him. Mr. Tyrold,
who participated in all her feelings, and shared
the same ideas, gently committed her to Lavinia,
and went into his study to the Doctor.</P>
<P>His own illusion was there quickly destroyed.
The looks of Dr. Marchmont boded nothing that
was happy. They wore not their customary ex∣pression.
The gravity of Mr. Tyrold shewed a
mind prepared for ill news, if not already oppressed
with it, and the doctor, after a few general speech∣es,
delivered the letter from Edgar.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold received it with a secret shuddering;
“Where,” he said, “is Mandlebert at present?”</P>
<P>“I believe, by this time—at the Hague.”</P>
<P>This sentence, with the grieved, yet still air
and tone of voice which accompanied it, was
death at once to every flattering hope: he immedi∣ately
read the letter, which, conceived in the ten∣derest
terms of reverence and affection, took a
short and simple, though touchingly respectful
leave of the purposed connexion, and demolished
at once every distant view of future conciliation.</P>
<P>He hung his head a moment, and sighed from
the bottom of his heart; but the resignation which
he summoned upon every sorrow was never deaf
to his call, and when he had secretly ejaculated a
short and silent prayer for fortitude to his beloved
wife, he turned calmy to the doctor, and began
conversing upon other affairs.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont presumed not to manifest the
commiseration with which he was filled. He saw
the true christian, enduring with humility mis∣fortune,
and the respectable parent supporting the
dignity of his daughter by his own. To the first
character, complaint was forbidden; to the second,
it would have been degrading. He looked at him
with veneration, but to spare further useless and
painful efforts, soon took leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, shaking hands with him, said, as
they were parting, “when you write to Mandle∣bert,
assure him of my constant affection. The
<PB N="166" REF="167"/>
world, Dr. Marchmont is too full of real evil, for
me at least, to cause one moment of unnecessary
uneasiness to any of its poor pilgrims. 'Tis strange,
my dear doctor, this is not more generally consi∣dered,
since the advantage would be so reciprocal
from man to man. But wrapt up in our own short
moment, we forget our neighbour's long hour!
and existence is ultimately embittered to all, by
the refined susceptibility for ourselves that mono∣polizes
our feelings.”</P>
<P>Doctor Marchmont, who in this last sentence
construed a slight reflection upon Edgar, expres∣sively
answered, “Our sensibility for others is not
always dormant, because not apparent—How much
of worth and excellence may two characters sepa∣rately
possess, where yet there are disuniting
particles which impede their harmonizing with
each other!”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, powerfully struck, saw now the
general nature of the conceptions which had caused
this lamented breach. He could not concur, but
he would not attempt to controvert: opinion in
this case must have even the precedence of justice.
If Edgar thought his daughter of a disposition with
which his own could not sympathise, it were vain
to expatiate upon her virtues or her sweetness;
that one doubt previously taken might mar their
assimilating efficacy. Comprehending, therefore,
the cause at large, he desired no detail; the words
of Dr. Marchmont, though decisive, were not of∣fensive,
and yet they parted perfect friends, each
perceiving, yet forgiving, that each cast upon the
other the error of false reasoning; Edgar to the
one, and Camilla to the other, appearing faultless
in the separation.</P>
<P>But not in the tasks which succeeded were their
offices as easily to be compared. Dr. Marchmont
wrote to Edgar that all was quietly relinquished,
and his measures were honourably acquitted; while
Mr. Tyrold, shut up in his study, spent there some
of the severest minutes of his life, in struggling for
<PB N="167" REF="168"/>
the equanimity he covetted to pronounce to his
daughter this last doom. Pity for her suspence
accelerated his efforts, and he then sent for her
down stairs.</P>
<P>His utmost composure, in such an interview,
was highly necessary for both. The pale and
trembling Camilla advanced with downcast eyes; but
when he took her in his arms, and kissed her, a
sudden ray of hope shot across her quick imagina∣tion,
and she looked up: an instant was now suffi∣cient
to rectify her mistake. The tenderness of
of her father wore no air of congratulation, it was
the mere offspring compassion, and the woe with
which it was mixt, though mild, though patient,
was too potent to require words for explanation.</P>
<P>The glance sufficed; her head dropt, her tears
in torrents bathed his bosom; and she retired to
Lavinia while yet neither of them had spoken.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, contented with virtuous exertions,
demanded not impossibilities; he left to nature
that first grief which too early exhortation or con∣troul
rather inflames than appeases. He then
brought her back to his apartment.</P>
<P>He conjured her, there, to remember that she
grieved not alone; that where the tears flowed not
so fast from the eyes, the sources were not dry
whence they sprung, and that bridled sorrow was
sometimetimes the most suffering.</P>
<P>“Alas, my dearest father, to think you mourn
too—and for me!—will that lessen what I feel?”</P>
<P>“Yes, my dear child, by a generous duty it
will point out to watch that the excess of one
affliction involve you not in another.”</P>
<P>“What a motive,” she answered, “for exer∣tion!
If the smallest part of your happiness—of
my honoured mother's—depends upon mine, I
shall be unhappy, I think, no more!”</P>
<P>A gush of tears ill accorded with this fond decla∣ration;
but Mr. Tyrold, without noticing them,
kindly replied, “Let your filial affection, my
child, check the inordinacy of your affliction,
<PB N="168" REF="169"/>
and I will accept with pleasure for your virtuous
mother, and with thanks for myself, the exertion
which, beginning for our sakes, may lead you to
that self denial which is the parent of our best hu∣man
actions, and approximates us the most to what
what is divine.”</P>
<P>Broken-hearted as was Camilla, her sorrows
would, at least apparently, have abated from con∣solation
so tender, if all she felt had been known;
if no latent and lurking evil had hung upon her
spirits, defeating all argument, and blighting all
comfort, by the cruel consciousness of concealed
mischief, which while incessantly she studied the
best moment for revealing, accident might prema∣turely
betray.</P>
<P>Upon this subject her thoughts were unremit∣tingly
bent, till, in a few days time, she received
a letter from Mrs. Mittin, informing her she had
just seen the money-lender, Mr. Clykes, who,
finding her so much under age, would not under∣take
the business for less than ten per cent, nor
without a free premium of at least twenty pounds.</P>
<P>The latter demand, so entirely out of her power
to grant, gave to her the mental strength she had
yet sought in vain; and determining to end this
baneful secret, she seized her own first moment of
emotion to relate to her father the whole of her
distresses, and cast herself upon his mercy.</P>
<P>I shall be happier, she cried, much happier, as,
with tottering steps, she hurried to the study; he
will be lenient, I know; and even if not, what
displeasure can I incur so severe as the eternal ap∣prehension
of doing wrong?</P>
<P>But her plan though well formed, had fixed upon
an ill-timed moment for its execution. She en∣tered
the room with an agitation which rather
sought than shunned remark, that some enquiry
might make an opening for her confession: but Mr.
Tyrold was intently reading a letter, and examin∣ing
some papers, from which he raised not his eyes
at her approach. She stood fearfully before him
<PB N="169" REF="170"/>
till he had done; but then, still not looking up,
he leant his head upon his hand, with a counte∣nance
so disturbed, that, alarmed from her design,
by the apprehension he had received some ill tidings
from Lisbon, she asked, in a faint voice, if the
foreign post were come in?</P>
<P>“I hope not!” he answered: “I should look
with pain, at this moment, upon the hand of your
unhappy mother!”</P>
<P>Camilla, affrighted, knew not now what con∣jecture;
but gliding into her pocket the letter of
Mrs. Mittin, stood suspended from her purpose.</P>
<P>“What ā reception,” he presently added, “is
preparing for that noblest of women when her
exile may end! That epoch, to which I have
looked forward as the brightener of my every
view upon earth—how is it now clouded!”</P>
<P>Giving her, then, the letter and papers; “The
son,” he said, “who once I had hoped would
prove the guardian of his sisters, the honour of
his mother's days, the future prop of my own—See,
Camilla, on how sandy a foundation mortal
man builds mortal hopes!”</P>
<P>The letter was from a very respectable tradesman,
containing a complaint that, for the three years Lio∣nel
had been at the University, he had never paid
one bill, though he continually ordered new articles:
and begging Mr. Tyrold would have the goodness
to settle the accounts he enclosed; the young gen∣tleman,
after fixing a day for payment, having
suddenly absconded without notice to any one.</P>
<P>“The sum, you see,” continued Mr. Tyrold,
“amounts to one hundred and seventy-one pounds;
a sum, for my income enormous. The allowance
I made this cruel boy, was not only adequate to
all his proper wants, and reasonable desires, but
all I could afford without distressing myself, or in∣juring
my other children: yet it has served him,
I imagine, but for pocket money! The im∣mense
sums he has extorted from both his uncles,
must have been swallowed up at a gaming table.
<PB N="170" REF="171"/>
Into what wretched courses has he run! These
bills, large as they are, I regard but as forerunners
of others; all he has received he has squan∣dered
upon his vices, and to-morrow, and the
next day, and the next, I may expect an encreas∣ing
list of his debts, from his hatter, his hosier,
his shoe-maker, his taylor,—and whoever he has
employed.</P>
<P>Camilla, overwhelmed with internal shame, yet
more powerful than grief itself, stood motionless.
These expences appeared but like a second part of
her own, with her milliner, her jeweller, and her
haberdasher; which now seemed to herself not less
wanton in extravagance.</P>
<P>Surprised by her entire silence, Mr. Tyrold
looked up. Her cheeks, rather livid than pale,
and the deep dismay of her countenance, extremely
affected him. The kindness of his embraces re∣lieved
her by melting her into tears, though the
speech which accompanied them was, to her con∣sciousness,
but reproach: “Let not your sisterly
feelings thus subdue you, my dearest Camilla. Be
comforted that you have given us no affliction
yourself, save what we must feel for your own un∣deservedly
altered prospects. No unthinking im∣prudence,
no unfeeling selfishness, has ever, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or an
instant, driven from your thoughts what you owe
to your duty, or weakened your pleasure in every
endearing filial tie. Let this chear you, my child;
and let us all try to submit calmly to our general
disappointment.”</P>
<P>Praise thus ill-timed rather probed than healed her
wounds. Am I punished? am I punished? She inter∣nally
exclaimed; but could not bear to meet the eyes
of her father, whose indulgence she felt as if abusing,
and whose good opinion seemed now but a delu∣sion.
Again, he made her over to the gentle
Lavinia for comfort, and fearing serious ill effects
from added misery, exerted himself, from this time,
to appear chearful when she was present.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172"/>
His predictions failed not to be fulfilled: the ap∣plication
made by one creditor, soon reached every
other, and urged similar measures. Bills there∣fore,
came in daily, with petitions for payment;
and as Lionel still wanted a month or two of being
of age, his creditors depended with confidence upon
the responsibility of his father.</P>
<P>Nor here closed the claims springing from
general ill conduct. Two young men of fashion,
hard pressed for their own failures, stated to Mr.
Tyrold the debts of honour owing them from
Lionel: and three notorious gamesters, who had
drawn in the unthinking youth to his ruin, en∣forced
the same information, with a hint that, if
they were left unsatisfied, the credit of the young
man would fall the sacrifice of their ill treatment.</P>
<P>The absence of Mrs. Tyrold at this period, by
sparing her daily difficulty as well as pain, was re∣joiced
in by her husband; though never so strongly
had he wanted her aiding counsel, her equal in∣terest,
and her consoling participation. Obliged
to act without them, his deliberation was short and
decisive for his measures, but long and painful for
their means of execution. He at once determined
to pay, though for the last time, all the trades
people; but the manner of obtaining the money
required more consideration.</P>
<P>The bills, when all collected, amounted to some∣thing
above five hundred pounds, which was but one
hundred short of his full yearly income.</P>
<P>Of this, he had always contrived to lay by an hun∣dred
pounds annually, which sum, with its accumu∣lating
interest, was destined to be divided between
Lavinia and Camilla. Eugenia required nothing; and
Lionel was to inherit the paternal little fortune. The
portion of Mrs. Tyrold, which was small, the estate
of her father having been almost all entailed upon
Mr. Relvil, was to be divided equally amongst her
children.</P>
<P>To take from the little hoard which, with so ten∣der
a care, he had heaped for the daughters, so large
<PB N="172" REF="173"/>
a share for the son, and to answer demands so unduly
raised, and ill deserved, was repulsive to his inclina∣tion,
and shocked his strong sense of equal justice.
To apply to Mr. Relvil would be preposterous; for
though upon him dwelt all his ultimate hopes for
Lionel, he knew him, at this moment, to be so
suffering and so irritated by his means, that to hear of
any new misdemeanours might incense him to an irre∣vocable
disinheritance.</P>
<P>With regard to Sir Hugh, nothing was too much
to expect from his generous kindness; yet he knew
that his bountiful heart had always kept his income
from overflowing; and that, for three years past,
Lionel had drained it without mercy. His prepara∣tions,
also, for the double marriages had, of late,
much straitened him. To take up even the smallest
part of what, in less expensive times, he had laid by,
he would regard as a breach of his solemn vow, by
which he imagined himself bound to leave Eugenia
the full property she would have possessed, had he
died instantly upon making it. Reason might have
shewn this a tie of supererogation; but where any man
conceived himself obeying the dictates of his consci∣ence,
Mr. Tyrold held his motives too sacred for
dispute.</P>
<P>The painful result of this afflicting meditation, was
laying before his daughters the whole of his difficul∣ties,
and demanding if they would willingly concur
in paying their brother's bills from their appropriate
little store, by adopting an altered plan of life, and
severe self-denial of their present ease and elegance,
to aid its speedy replacement.</P>
<P>Their satisfaction in any expedient to serve their
brother that seemed to fall upon themselves, was sin∣cere,
was even joyful: but they jointly besought
that the sum might be freely taken up, and deducted
for ever more from the hoard; since no earthly grati∣fication
could be so great to them, as contributing their
mite to prevent any deprivation of domestic enjoy∣ment
to their beloved parents.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174"/>
His eyes glistened, but not from grief; it was the
pleasure of virtuous happiness in their purity of filial
affection. But though he knew their sincerity, he
would not listen to their petition. “You are not
yet,” said he, “aware what your future calls may be
for money. What I have yet been able to save,
without this unexpected seizure, would be inadequate
to your even decent maintenance, should any accident
stop short its encrease. Weep not, my dear children!
my health is still good, and my prospect of lengthened
life seems fair. It would be, however, a temporal
folly as well as a spiritual presumption, to forget the
precarious tenure of human existence. My life, my
dear girls, will he happier, without being shorter,
for making provisions for its worldly cessation.”</P>
<P>“But, Sir! but my father!” cried Camilla∣hanging
over him, and losing in filial tenderness her
personal distresses; “if your manner of living is
altered, and my dear mother returns home and sees
you relinquishing any of your small, your temperate
indulgencies, may it not yet more embitter her sufferings
and her displeasure for the unhappy cause? For her
sake then, if not for ours.”—</P>
<P>“Do not turn away, dearest Sir!” cried Lavinia;
“what mother ever merited to have her peace the first
study of her children, if it is not ours?”</P>
<P>“O Providence benign!” said Mr. Tyrold, fold∣ing
them to his heart, “how am I yet blessed in my
children!—True and excellent daughters of my in∣valuable
wife—This little narration is the solace I
shall have to offer for the grief I must communicate.”</P>
<P>He would not, however, hearken to their proposi∣tion;
his peace, he said, required not only immediate
measures for replacing what he must borrow, but also
that no chasm should have lieu in funding his usual
annual sum for them. All he would accept was the
same severe forbearance he should instantly practice
himself, and which their mother, when restored to
them, would be the first to adopt and improve. And
this, till its end was answered, they would all steadily
<PB N="174" REF="175"/>
continue, and then, with chearful self-approvance,
resum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their wonted comforts.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold had too frequent views of the brevity
of human life to postpone, even from one sun to ano∣ther,
any action he deemed essential. A new general
system, therefore, immediately pervaded his house.
Two of the servants, with whom he best could dis∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
were discharged; which hurt him m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re than
any other privation, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he loved, and was loved by
every domestic who lived with him. His table, al∣ways
simple though elegant, was now reduced to plain
necessaries; he parted with every horse, but one to
whose long services he held himself a debtor; and
whatever, throughout the whole oeconomy of his small
establishment, admitted simplifying, deducting, or
abolishment, received without delay, its requisite
alteration or dismission.</P>
<P>These new regulations were quietly, but complete∣ly,
put in practice, before he would discharge one bill
for his son; to whom, nevertheless, though his con∣duct
was strict, his feelings were still lenient. He
attributed not to moral turpitude his errors nor his
crimes, but to the prevalence of ill example, and to
an unjustifiable and dangerous levity, which irresista∣bly
led him to treat with mockery and trifling the most
serious subjects. The punishment, however, which
he had now drawn upon himself would yet, he hoped,
touch his heart.</P>
<P>But the debts called debts of honour, met not with
similar treatment. He answered with spirited resent∣ment
demands he deemed highly flagitious, counselling
those who sent them, when next they applied to an un∣happy
family to whose calamities they had contribut∣ed,
to enquire first if its principles, as well as its
fortune, made the hazards of gaming amongst its do∣mestic
responsibilities.</P>
