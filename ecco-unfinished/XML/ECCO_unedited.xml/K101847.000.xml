<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THIS little publication was made for
a particular child, but the public
is welcome to the use of it. It was
found that, amidst the multitude of books
professedly written for children, there is
not one adapted to the comprehension of
a child from two to three years old. A
grave remark, or a connected story, how∣ever
simple, is above his capacity; and</HI>
nonsense <HI>is always below it; for Folly
is worse than Ignorance. Another great
defect is the want of</HI> good paper, <HI>a</HI>
<PB REF="3"/>
clear and large type, <HI>and</HI> large spaces.
<HI>They only, who have actually taught
young children, can be sensible how ne∣cessary
these assistances are. The eye of
a child and of a learner cannot catch,
as ours can, a small, obscure, ill-formed
word, amidst a number of others all
equally unknown to him.—To supply
these deficiencies is the object of this book.
The task is humble, but not mean; for
to lay the first stone of a noble building,
and to plant the first idea in a human
mind, can be no dishonour to any hand.</HI></P>
