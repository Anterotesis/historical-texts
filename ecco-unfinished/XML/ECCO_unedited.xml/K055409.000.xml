<P>I TAKE the Liberty to inscribe this Dra∣matic Production to yourself, in Hopes it may be thought a Proof of your Judgment as well as of your Friendship. If, however, on Perusal, it should unfortunately be rejected as an Evidence of the one, your Treatment of it will incontestibly re∣main a Record of the other, towards</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE very extraordinary circumstances which attended the hearing, or rather the not hearing of this piece, with the subsequent contentions which it occasioned, would seem sufficiently to call for its publication: these circumstances, however, the Author would certainly have foregone, ra∣ther than appear to make appeals from the deter∣mination of the Public; but having been charged with bringing on a polite Theatre many low and gross indecencies, many vulgar and improper allusions, justice, and not vanity, obliges him in some measure to rescue himself from so ungen∣tleman-like a conduct. In doing this, however, the Author begs that it may now, as well as for∣merly, be perfectly understood, he could never
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
mean to dispute the judgment, or oppose the de∣cided opinion of the town;—all he ever wished or requested was, a fair and candid trial, that their opinion might be supported by dignity and justice.</P>
<P>Without entering into the reasons why a piece, which had drawn three of the most brilliant au∣diences in London, should be taken from the stage, the Author desires to say a few words in his own behalf:—The amusement of his leisure hours was the first cause of his dramatic endea∣vours; the indulgence of the public has alone encouraged their continuance, and has always been his best reward. The ridiculous insinua∣tion that pecuniary advantage was the sole ob∣ject of his literary pursuits, scarcely deserves the Author's serious reply; though had his situation in life made such an attention necessary, he sees no reason why it should be branded with re∣proach. Circumstanced as he is, he takes the liberty to contradict every assertion of the kind; nor does he think any impartial person will ima∣gine, he could for a moment wish to impose a Drama upon the town against their consent, for the trifling consideration of a night's emolu∣ment: on the contrary he saw, or thought he saw, a great majority for two evenings in his
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
favour, and that majority consisting of many of the first and most respectable names in this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Colman, to be sure, as a Gentleman and a man of letters, knowing the difficulties which every dramatic writer is subject to, and the ene∣mies he has to encounter, took a warm and zea∣lous part in his support, for which he shall al∣ways think himself under great obligations: at the same time he makes no doubt, but Mr. Col∣man imagined himself justified in his conduct from the apparent sentiments of the audience; for though he might have felt for the Author as a friend, he never could have forgot his own situation so far, as to presume to dictate to the public entertainment in opposition to the public voice.</P>
<P>Thus much in justification of the repeated en∣deavours to have the Comedy quietly repre∣sented. That it contains not those numerous indelicacies ascribed to it, the Author hopes the perusal of his play will sufficiently prove: in con∣tradiction even of such a design, he begs it may be remembered, that having frequently had the honour of bringing his labours before the pub∣lic,
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
which they have deigned not to disapprove, he has some reason to plead past conduct in his favour: but were he even weak and absurd enough to offend seriously in this particular, such indelicacies, he is warranted in saying, could ne∣ver have escaped the discerning and judicious eye of Mr. Colman.</P>
<P>In a word, the Author begs again to repeat, that he does not mean to murmur at the public decree; but having been charged with inten∣tions he is not conscious of, and having been unkindly denied a candid hearing, after he had carefully erased every passage he could conceive objectionable, he takes the opportunity, when tumult has subsided, and the voice of conten∣tion is heard no more, to leave it in the breast of every dispassionate reader to determine, whe∣ther dulness and indecency pervade his scenes throughout.</P>
<P>Having said thus much in apology for the present publication, it may probably be ex∣pected that the Author should enlarge a little upon the nature of the piece itself, and account for the novelty which may in some measure have contributed to hurry its fate.—Characters and
<PB N="ix" REF="7" MS="y"/>
situations drawn from ordinary life, being in every one's view, accommodate themselves to every apprehension; but manners and customs of other times and countries are not to be go∣verned by the standard of modern and domestic observation: it is requisite to consider how far they accord with the accounts we have of them, before we determine on their merits, and to re∣collect that, like strangers at our table, though they may not immediately strike the fancy, yet if received with caution and politeness, we may relish their converse as they grow familiar, and they may in the end turn out pleasant compa∣nions of our lives.</P>
<P>On perusing the anecdote from which this play is taken, the Author imagined the story might succeed on the stage, by the addition of some fresh personages in the Drama, and on that account he introduced the family that are not found in the Novel. To contrast the poverty and pride of the German Baron, with the vul∣garity and wealth of a Dutch trader would, as it appeared to him, produce that light and shade so necessary for dramatic effect; to make the son of that Dutchman the lover and husband of Cecil was, he thought, the most forcible me∣thod
<PB N="x" REF="8"/>
of exciting the Baron's contempt and in∣dignation. If it should be objected that the language of the Hollanders is not polite, he can only answer, that he should think it incompa∣tible with their situation; and had he given them ideas, and made them discourse like people of fashion, such a dialogue, so far from heightening the merit of the piece, would, in his opinion, totally have destroyed it. The whimsical words put into the mouths of the Dutchman and his wife, and used in some of their songs, are absolutely Dutch phrases and terminations anglicised; they are not introduced as specimens of elegant writing, but purposely to enforce the characters; and therefore ought not to be tried by the nice rules of refined cri∣ticism. The preservation of character is, in the Author's opinion, the first distinction of dramatic writing; if he is mistaken, he alone must suffer for his error: but however lightly it may rest upon gentlemens' minds to pass hasty judgments on the works of others, he hopes it will be considered how painful it is, to a person of any sensibility, to experience those marked and pub∣lic censures, which, distinct from the merits or demerits of the piece, the dramatic, more than any other writer, is often doomed to bear; to
<PB N="xi" REF="9"/>
have his character arraigned, his private life in∣vestigated, and every sentiment of his heart tra∣duced and vilified, when the only crime he has committed has been a laudable desire of honest fame, and an anxious wish to entertain the pub∣lic, though with abilities perhaps too confined to bring those wishes to perfection.</P>

<LG>
<L>NO wondering, good folks—I've done my best—</L>
<L>Bedizen'd a-la-German, like the rest!</L>
<L>Thanks to our Author and his Gothic play,</L>
<L>Fine havock has our wardrobe felt to-day;</L>
<L>Old modes new made, such flouncing and fresh facing,</L>
<L>Such trimming, cutting, butt'ning and tight lacing;</L>
<L>Great, squat, old German milleners in troops,</L>
<L>'Squires in trunk hose, and fat Dutch frows in hoops;</L>
<L>'Twere odd, indeed, if 'midst this general riot,</L>
<L>A female's curious temper could be quiet;</L>
<L>So, like our mother Eve, resolv'd to see</L>
<L>If some old fig-leaf garment suited me,</L>
<L>Up stairs I stole, without our prompter's call,</L>
<L>And here I am—Ruff—Fardingale and all!</L>
<L>Well, gentlemen, what think ye? do I strike ye?</L>
<L>Speak truth for once, and say you do not like me.</L>
<L>'Tis true no ton—no prince's stripe I boast—</L>
<L>Choice requisite to make a modern toast;</L>
<L>No Vestris blue, to tempt one spark to marriage,</L>
<L>No brimstone, I confess it, in my carriage;</L>
<L>But a plain, simple, strange, old-fashion'd creature,</L>
<L>Without e'en art enough to banish nature.</L>
<L>Yet still from this odd dress some uses flow,</L>
<L>Arm'd cap-a-peé one dares to meet a beau;</L>
<L>This frizzled ruff, methinks, looks like resistance,</L>
<L>And whalebone petticoats say—"keep your distance!"</L>
<L>"Psha! cries my Lord,—now pox—it is one's duty</L>
<L>"To lop off all incumbrances from beauty;</L>
<L>"Nature I love most liberally display'd,</L>
<L>"Charms without veil, and lawns without a shade;</L>

"Give me the fair who laughs at ogling, sighing,</L>
<L>"Drills you recruits, hunts fox-hounds, and shoots flying,</L>
<L>"Tow'rs o'er her sex, a coachman in—a wig,</L>
<L>"And drives in hand—six ponies, and—a gig."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If this is <HI>ton</HI>—I easily foresee</L>
<L>The judgment that awaits my dress and me:</L>
<L>I own bad <HI>habits</HI> should be laid aside—</L>
<L>And <HI>this</HI> remov'd—your censures should subside.</L>
<L>One serious truth, and one is not too hard—</L>
<L>I bring, ye fair, commission'd from our bard:</L>
<L>He bids me say—that howsoe'er we boast</L>
<L>"To drive, hunt, shoot, talk loud, and be a toast;</L>
<L>"To win by gentler manners should be ours,</L>
<L>"To soothe the troubles of domestic hours;</L>
<L>"And say those manly ladies what they will,</L>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Franz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it may appear odd—but my reasons, to reason logically, are twofold—the first, because my party are ordered into this part of the country; the next, because I expect my worthy father here every moment; and I, like a dutiful son and an obedient officer, am come hither to perform two obligations at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And, pray what can have induced your wor∣thy father, as you call him, to leave Holland and visit Gottingen? Formerly, I recollect he used to be a a little more attentive to the main chance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very reason that brings him hither, for you must know, that said attention has made him at∣tach himself to a small territory in this neighbourhood; and he is coming to see that it is not run away from him.</P>

<P>Why then in two words, my careful father has a mortgage upon a castle which belongs to Baron Kinkver—damn his long name! I can never pronounce it; but it contains about fifteen syllables, and he lives within a league of this place.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, I know him—tho' I believe you'll find his name and his pedigree longer than his rent-roll.</P>

<P>I suppose so, and the Family Tree the only one upon the estate. But, <HI>apropos,</HI> as I am going to be introduced, pray inform me what the houshold consists of.</P>

<P>WELL, Baron, you see that I and my frow are come as far as from Amsterdam to see you, and to meet my Son, and to pay our compliments, and to look after our money, as our Burgo▪Master says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mef.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yaw, yaw; we have done all this out of pure kindness to you, Baron, and to have an eye to our pro∣perty—as Hubby has told you.</P>

<P>You are too good, Mynheer Boterham.—I hope you and your wife, and your son, will find no reason to repent of your journey.</P>

<P>That is impossible, Monsieur le Baron.—A reception so polite—A family so old and so respectable—</P>

<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, allow me to say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say?—I don't mind any thing that officers say, because you see they affect to be so polite, and all that—they don't quite stick to—you understand me?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fran.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, that truth is not inconsistent with good breeding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good breeding!—It was your mother that made you a soldier; if I had had my will, you should have borne no other arms than I have done all my life; but she could never be satisfied—you understand me, Baron?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Zounds, Mynheer Boterham, what compari∣sons you are making!

<P>Oh, how lightly one treads in pursuing a good action, especially when one does it out of spite!

You wretch, says he, dow durst you presume to ally my undutiful daugh∣ter with that dog! "Lord! Baron," says I, "it's because 'tis my duty to do it." To have the assurance, says he, to put a stop to the honor of my family! "Why," says I, "it is the only way to encrease it." Then, says he again, my uncle, the Duke of Hogstye—my aunt Flabigastiberg—my great grandfather—"And now," says I, "you'll be a grandfather your∣self"—Zounds! you dog, I'll break every bone in your skin. "Heytitity," says I,—Oh no! I could never say any thing to that in my life.—After all, what have I lost by quitting the Baron? Some excel∣lent abusive words, intermixed with a few blows; a charming plenty of work, and a good scarcity of meat; various opportunities of activity in the day-time, and a night's rest in an old clothes press.</P>
