<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Work may, perhaps, re∣mind
the Reader of Two Vo∣lumes
which have appeared in
the World under the same Ti∣tle;
but they are desired to observe, to
prevent Mistakes, that those Volumes en∣joy
nothing of the Subject of this Work,
but the meer Title; nor is there the least
Similitude between them.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
What those Books contain is none of our
Business here, and this Work will speak
for it self.</P>
<P>The Instructor here is the Master of
a Family, whose Business and Duty is to
inform and confirm his Children in
right Principles; How he discharges
the paternal Obligation, will appear in the
very first Entrance: The Work has a
double Aspect;</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Example</HI> from the Father <HI>in∣structing:</HI>
This, indeed, is of the last Im∣portance
to Parents, and Heads of Fa∣milies,
as it is a Pattern presented for
their Imitation; and so it is an Instruction
to Fathers, as well as a Father's Instruc∣tion
to Children: I could be glad to say
that Part was less useful than the rest; but
by how much the Example is wanting, by
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
so much the Work will be the more va∣luable.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The other Face of this Work respects
the Children <HI>Instructed;</HI> and there the
Example of a sober, well-taught, and re∣ligiously
educated Family is very particu∣lar;
shewing how receptive such are of
farther Instruction: Such drink in Know∣ledge
as a Fish drinks in Water, <HI>viz.</HI> for
Life; receiving it as Infants suck their
Mothers Milk, with Pleasure and De∣light.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Children here are brought in eager
to know, willing to be instructed; de∣siring
their Father to inform them of the
Principles, and of the Mistakes too, of
the Religious Part of the World. It is
true, that Parents are under unquestioned
Obligations to teach and instruct their
Children; but I will not say that no Pa∣rents
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
want Helps to quicken them to the
Work, as well as to enable them to per∣form
It; here we shall find both.</P>
<P>Some Parents would instruct their
Children; if they knew how; I doubt
more neglect it that do know how. There
seems to be more Reluctance to the Work
to answer for, than Ignorance how to
perform it; especially in this enlighten'd
Age, and this instructed Part of the
World. 'Tis hard we should prompt
Children to prompt their Parents to in∣struct
Them; but I believe this may pass
for a Truth in most of our Families, that
if Children would be more busy enquiring
of their Parents, they would all be
better instructed than they are. No
Wonder whole Families are ignorant and
dark, when the Parents are as back∣ward
to teach, as their Children are to
be taught.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
It is a fad Reproof to a Parent,
when the want of his instructing his
Children discovers itself first to him by
their Ignorance: It was a saucy, but a
melancholy Return, which I once heard a
Child make to his Father, for calling him
Fool, <HI>viz. That he should have been
wiser, if</HI> his Father <HI>had taught him
better.</HI></P>
<P>The Children here are represented in∣quiring
and asking Questions, not of a
Father unable or unwilling to instruct
Them, but as guiding the Father's Dis∣courses
to that in particular which they
stood most in need of being instructed in;
such Inquiry is a Part of their own In∣struction,
and a Guide to their Instructor
also; for they first shew the Father what
it is they stand in more than ordinary Oc∣casion
of being taught, and he turns his
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
Discourse accordingly; so they direct him
how to instruct them.</P>
<P>Thus it will always he where the
Family is compleatly instructed, and apt
for Instruction; and 'tis a happy Con∣junction
for Improvement, where a Parent
instructing, is led by the Inquiries of his
Children to that particular Part of In∣struction
which they most want.</P>
<P>The Points of Instruction which take
up this Work, intimate, that the Children
were not too young to be talked with upon
the most nice and difficult Points of
Religion, and yet were not too old to he
taught; and in particular, did not think
themselves too old for Teaching, or too
wise to learn.</P>
<P>'Tis one of the worst Parts of Folly,
when Children think they need no Teach∣ing.
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>
It is the Character of the Brutish
only, that he <HI>hates Instruction,</HI> Prov.
xii. 1. Nothing can be farther off from
Wisdom, than he that thinks himself above
being wiser. The conceited Man is ge∣nerally
the ignorant Man; he that is
humble is always teachable; and he knows
very little that scorns to increase his
Knowledge; 'tis a preposterous Pride,
and has both the Folly and the Vice: A
Man ought no more to despise being
made wiser, than he should despise his
being made richer, which very few incline
to.</P>
<P>But not to dwell upon that fashionable
Madness; the Family I am to bring up∣on
the Stage, is the Reverse of it: Here
is the Father ready to instruct, and the
Children willing to be instructed; both
valuable Examples, and both instructive
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
in their Kind, as well to Fathers as to
Children, and both intended to be so.</P>
<P>I have nothing to apologize for, in the
Plainness and Deficiency of the Instructi∣on;
every Thing here is suited to the Ca∣pacity
of Children, and therein answers
the End it is designed for. There might,
no doubt, be more said to the Subject, and
farther Explanations be given of the Points
discoursed of, nor does the Author think
he boasts, an saying he could have said
more upon the same Heads.</P>
<P>But Necessity, and the several Cir∣cumstances
of Things answer for him in
most, if not all the Cases, where such
Objection would otherwise lie against
him.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Want of Room: The Work is prescrib'd
in Bulk, and could not exceed, with∣out
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
loading the Reader and swel∣ling
the Book; and this, as it is a
Limitation, he calls a <HI>Necessity.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Several Subjects necessary to be
treated of, in the narrow Compass so
limitted; none of which could be
more fully handled without thrusting
others out.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Nature of instructing Children
is peculiar to itself, and forbids pro∣lix
Discourses; We are not upon a
critical Dissertation, but a plain,
open, and concise Reasoning; suited
to the Reading of Children, and
suited to the Questions which are
supposed the Children were capable of
propounding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Hence the plainest Things are proposed,
and the plainest Answers are given, with∣out
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
entring into a tedious Search into. An∣tiquity,
and without drawing up the
Champions and Arguments on either
Side, like Armies in <HI>Battalia.</HI></P>
<P>Capital Truths are supported by the
fewest Credentials; 'tis enough to bring
good Authority for the Fundamentals or
Principles, and then stand by those
Principles as established. Thus the Fa∣ther
first confirms the Divine Authority of
the Scripture, and then brings the Scrip∣ture
as an undoubted Authority for what
it supports.</P>
<P>As to Popery, 'tis treated, indeed, with
Ridicule and Jest; but then it is not in
a Way of Buffoon and Raillery, but the
Ridicule is form'd upon its own Absurdities,
as well in Doctrine as Practice; and those
Practices reduced into Evidence: So that
no Injustice is willingly done the Papists,
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
either as to their Persons or their Prin∣ciples.</P>
<P>If they have exposed themselves by of∣fering
such gross things to the World, as
to make the very Children laugh at them;
if their Practice is loaded with innume∣rable
Fripperies; if a ridiculous Pagean∣try
glares in our Faces in their most so∣lemn
Things; they must bear with the
World for mobbing them off the Stage;
and if they are hiss'd at, they must be con∣tent,
while they do Things that cannot he
otherwise treated.</P>
<P>There is, however, an Account given
in the Work itself, why the Father chose to
talk of Popery in such a Way; being what
suited best the Method which his Apostatiz'd
Son took with his Sisters, and best fur∣nished
the Children to answer him in his
own Way; yet, even the merriest Tale of
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
them all, is vouched by justifiable Authori∣ties,
and supported by authentick History;
so the Authors quoted are answerable for
it, that 'tis no Slander.</P>
<P>The last and most important Branch of
the Parents Instruction, may, perhaps, be
most cavill'd at, as it is, indeed, a Subject,
which at present, is, disputed in the World,
chiefly by the Help of Cavil and Cri∣ticism:
I shall say no more than this for it;
Tho' all may not be said, that the Cause
would admit, yet nothing is said but what
is, I believe, well supported by the Au∣thority
of Scripture, and that Scripture
Authority made so plain too, that even
the Children could not only receive it,
but receive Satisfaction by it.</P>
<P>The Arguments upon the weighty Sub∣ject
of the Divinity of our Saviour, have
been so long, and so learnedly controverted
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
in the World, that some are apt to say,
there remains nothing to be said upon that
Point that has not been said before; but
I must take upon me to answer in the Ne∣gative,
and refer to the Work within;
where, I believe, some Arguments are
brought for the Affirmative, which how∣ever
old the Dispute is, and howsoever
learned the Disputants, yet have never
been handled before, at least among us.
The Author says, those Arguments have
been convincing, nay, confirming to him∣self,
and, he hopes, they may be so to
others; at least, he has done his Endea∣vour,
with Diligence and Sincerity, and
hopes he may, with a composed Mind,
expect a Blessing. A MEN.</P>

<HEAD>A NEW
Family Instrucor, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> FORMER Work, which bore this
Title, has gone very successfully thro'
those Branches of Instruction, which
more especially concern'd the first and
youngest Stages of Life, and for in∣stilling
the most early Notions, of God and Religion,
into the Minds of Children not grown up.</P>
<P>But, Religious Instruction is never at End, till
our Children cease to be Children; nor even then,
while there is a Disposition in them to be farther in∣form'd:
Masters of Families can never be too care∣ful
to fortify the Minds of their Posterity with good
Principles; and prepare them to encounter those Ene∣mies
of all serious Religion, which they shall be sure
to meet with, as they grow up, in an Age so bold in
Error as this is.</P>
<P>For these Reasons, I have made it my Study
for several Years, to find out some Family, if it
was possible, whose Example might be Historically
recommended to the World, and where other
Parents, and other Children might have a Pattern
laid before them, a Rule to walk and act by; and
<PB N="2" REF="16"/>
from whom, I might take a Light to guide my self,
in the great Work of instructing Families, and that
Children might have a Standard for their Conduct
in Ages to come.</P>
<P>The Family, who I have thus made the Point in
Perspective, and set before you for Imitation in this
Work, are not nam'd: Decency forbids it; we should
no more publish our Praises by Name, than Re∣proaches.
'Tis enough that such Families have been,
and, we may be encourag'd to believe, such may be
again; that Fathers, alike diligent in the instructing
their Children, shall have the like Success; for Chil∣dren
so instructed, generally make good Instructors in
their Turn, and Religion is propagated in Families by
the Examples of the Teachers that went before them.</P>
<P>There dwelt in the City of <HI>London,</HI> a Person of a
middling Size, as to Figure and Estate, being what we
call a Sabstantial Tradesman, or Shopkeeper; one that
had been many Years in Business; and had by In∣dustry,
and an honest Application in his way of
Trade, obtained some tolerable Share of Wealth; in
a Word, one who pass'd for a Rich Man, in propor∣tion
to his Trade, which was that of an Apothecary,
and he liv'd not far from <HI>Leadenball-Street.</HI></P>
<P>He had several Children, who he had Educated
very carefully, as well with respect to their Manners
and Morals, as their Principles and Religion: And it
appear'd in their Behaviour, as Family Government
generally does: Education is an Ornament, that
shines in the Children who are Instructed, and
reflects back a Lustre on the Parent Instructing;
and so it was here, for the Parent and the Children
were Ornaments to one another; their Neighbours
valued them; the Father was respected by every
Body, as the most known and eminent Example, for
the well Ordering, and good Government of his
Family; and the Children were observ'd, for having
an Original Beauty upon their Appearance, a Modesty,
<PB N="3" REF="17"/>
Decency, and Sober Behaviour, peculiar, as it were,
to themselves; which shew'd they had been well
Taught, and that they had been obedient Observers
of their Father's good Instrucions.</P>
<P>This, as it gave their Father a general Character,
as I have said, so it recommended the Children; the
sober Families in the Neighbourhood, placed them
as Patterns for the Conduct of their own Children,
recommending these for Companions to them, and for
Examples; being always mighty well satisfied, when
they saw any of their own Children keep Company
with Mr.—the Apothecary's; for then they were
sure to hear nothing amiss; So that, in a Word, The
Children of this honest Man, had the Character of
sober, well-bred, religious Youths, above all the rest
of the Neighbourhood, and were beloved and
esteem'd by every body on that Account.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but his own Example spread itself
among other Families; it encouraged other Masters
of Families in the same Street, and in neighbouring
Places to do the same; and several of them set about
the great and necessary Work of Family Instruction,
by his Example.</P>
<P>The Apothecary was a Man well Educated him∣self,
and particularly he had had a Religious Father;
and tho' he had not, what we call a Liberal Education,
that is, had not been bred at the University; yet he had
some Learning; as, indeed, his Calling of an Apothe∣cary,
in some measure, requir'd; and this qualify'd him
still the more, for the great Work of instructing his Chil∣dren,
as it gave him the Knowledge, not of Religion only,
in the common and ordinary practical Parts of it: But
also, had made him Casuist enough, and able to inform
his Children, in the most difficult and disputed Arti∣cles
of Religion; especially those Points chiefly de∣bated
between the Popish, and the Reformed
Churches. And as he lived in a Time when those
Points came more than ordinarily to be disputed;
<PB N="4" REF="18"/>
namely, From the Time of the Restoration of King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. when Popery began to be more than,
usually encourag'd, and to encroach upon this Nation;
and to the Time of King <HI>James</HI> II. when it made a
bold Push at a Re-establishment; So he had a more
than ordinary Occasion, to make use of his Know∣ledge
and Experience in those Controversies; to con∣firm
his Children in the best Principles, and to qua∣lify
them to encounter with Error, and with all the
Auxiliar Powers of Idolatry, such as Superstition
Blind Zeal, Ignorance, and Ignorant Devotion; all
which were exceedingly growing, and getting Ground
upon this Nation, during that whole Interval, how∣ever
long, from 1661, to 1688; that is to say▪
when it received that fatal Blow by the Revolution▪
in which the Religion, as well as Liberties of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
were effectually Settled and Establish'd, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they continue to this Day: 'Tis true, Popery begin
now, indeed, to struggle again, and to gain Ground
too among us; an eminent Sign of the Decay of
Christian Knowledge, and of reviving the loose Prin∣ciples
of Ignorance and Superstition among us; al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which concurs to make the present Undertaking the
more useful, and even absolutely necessary among us.
But to return to my Subject;</P>
<P>The Apothecary's Custom in his Family, and
which is very useful to describe for the Imitation, of
others, was as follows.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. When his Children were Young, he constantly
every Day read to them Two Chapters of the
Bible in the Morning, and Two in the
Afternoon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Which I should have mentioned first, but that
his Reading was always first; He constantly
call'd them all together, with his whole House,
Servants as well as Children, to his Family
Worship.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="19"/>
3. Every Day, for about an Hour, which was
generally after Dinner, he took Occasion to
talk familiarly to his Children upon any useful
Subject, as Things proper for Conversation pre∣sented;
especially, making his Discourse, at
those Times, agreeable, pleasant to his Chil∣dren,
and suitable to' their Understanding.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>As his Children grew up, he chang'd his Reading
the Scripture, before his Morning and Evening
Prayer, to his causing his Children to read it them∣selves,
and to read so in their Turns, as to be sure
to have them all read alike.</P>
<P>And then, instead of his daily Discourses, after
Dinner, he employ'd the Hour, for two Days only
in a Week, in Catechising his Children, and his Ser∣vants
also, that is to say, his Apprentices, and such
other as would submit to it; tho' Servants began
even then, to be a little above submitting to be cate∣chised,
as most of them are since.</P>
<P>After some Years more, the Children grew too big
for the Catechise too, and being also perfect in all
the Answers, not only of the particular Cate∣chism,
but of all such Questions as related to the
grounding them in the Principles of Christian Know∣ledge,
then he resum'd those two Hours, or the
dining Hours of those two Days, for his former Kind
of Discourses.</P>
<P>Only 1. As they encreased in Knowledge and
Years, so he suited his Lectures, or <HI>Table-Talk</HI> (as
it might be called) to their Years, carrying them on
from one Thing to another, till, in a Word, he
made them Masters of almost all sorts of useful
Knowledge, and of all the needful Points of Reli∣gion;
I mean, the disputed Points, especially such
as related to Idolatry, to <HI>Socinian</HI> Errors, and to all
the Modern Heresies of the Times; such as to
Deism, Scepticism, and Atheism, with all our
<PB N="6" REF="20"/>
Free-thinking Errors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Things which were but
newly started up in the World, in his Time,
and were not grown to the flagrant Height as
we have since seen them come to; and which his
Successors in this happy Practice, found it much
more difficult to struggle with. By this daily
Practice, conscientiously and diligently continued
his Children grew up to such a Degree of Know∣ledge,
and to such a solid Judgment, in all needful
Points, that they were not to be equall'd as a Fa∣mily,
and were the Admiration of all that knew
them; especially as this Degree of their Understand∣ing
in the best Things, was join'd with a Degree o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Modesty and Humility in their Behaviour, according
to the Pattern of their worthy Father, which was
admired by all People, and imitable but by very few.</P>
<P>Those Things going on with them till they came
to riper Years, they became a very happy Family▪
and being bless'd, and successful too in the World▪
the ancient Father, grown so by living near Eighty
Years of Age, died in Peace; having liv'd to se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
most of his Children well and comfortably settle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in the World, treading happily in his own Steps▪
as well of Religion as Sobriety, and governing their
own Families in the same excellent Order, after hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Example.</P>
<P>While the pious Father was alive, it was observ'd▪
that the good Order and Government of his Family
was such, that, as I have said, several other Master
of Families, in the Neighbourhood, set up the
same, or like Family Orders, in their Houses by
his Example, and some of them would use so much
Freedom with him, as to come and discourse with
him, as they found Occasion, in order to have his Ad∣vice
and Direction, in Cases wherein they met with
Difficulty and Obstruction in the Way of their per∣forming
it; some from refractory Children, some
from disorderly Servants, and some from the Hin∣drance
<PB N="7" REF="21"/>
of other Relations; some of one Kind, some
of another.</P>
<P>This good Man was always their Oracle, in those
Difficulties, and he gave his Advice with such Ten∣derness
and Concern for the Persons occasioning
those Obstructions, he being a Man of a large
Heart, an extensive Charity, and abounding with a
Sweetness of Temper, that he never got the Ill-will
of any Body, tho' he found himself oblig'd to be,
as it were, a Counsellor against them.</P>
<P>He had put his eldest Son out Apprentice to an
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, in the same Street, who was a
very sober good Man, and had a sober Family, tho'
not quite so religious a Family as the Apothecary but
who, being acquainted with the Apothecary and his
Family, soon follow'd the Example, at least in some
Part of it; particularly, the Merchant kept extraordi∣nary
Family-Orders, and a constant Family-Worship,
and, which was very remarkable in a Gentleman bred
abroad, that is to say, in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> he was
a very strict Observer of the Lord's Day.</P>
<P>Nor did he sanctify the Day, according to our
modern Practice of keeping the Sabbath in Time of
<HI>Divine Service</HI> only, as if the Command had been
under their Correction, or that it had been worded
thus: <HI>Remember,</HI> all the Time of Divine Service, on
<HI>the Sabbath Day to keep it holy;</HI> but from the Evening
of the Sabbath there were, in his Family, visible
Tokens of its Approach by a Kind of gradual Pre∣paration.</P>
<P>It was with him as it is in the Course of Na∣ture
on the Break of Day, that as there is a
Twilight in the Morning before the Sun rises,
intimating that the Day is approaching, that the
Shades of the Night are scattering; that the Peo∣ple,
if they are awake, may think of getting up,
and going about their proper Calling; So on the
<HI>Saturday</HI> Evening there was an <HI>Apparatus</HI> for the
<PB N="8" REF="22"/>
approaching Day, a gradual ceasing from Busi∣ness,
laying down the daily Labour sooner than
at other Times; going to Bed sooner that they
might not be oblig'd to lie a Bed in the Morning
longer than usual; retiring in the Evening for suita∣ble
Meditations, preparatory for the Sabbath, and,
as the good Merchant himself used to call it, getting
his Sabbath-Day Thoughts about him; and in this
Particular, the Merchant even out-did the Apothe∣cary:
There were, indeed, two Things, which were
accidental to their respective Callings, which made a
Difference in the Manner of their Family-Govern∣ment,
as it related to the Particular above, and yet
they were both strict and religious Observers of
all such Duties as Conscience and good Principles
requir'd.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Merchant, by the Course of his Business,
being call'd out to the Exchange (for the Ex∣change-Time
was then usually about One
o'Clock) could not spare the Time, from the
close of his Dinner, to sit, and talk, and con∣verse
familiarly, with his Children, as the
other did; his Business necessarily called him
away, and he was oblig'd to attend the Call.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Apothecary, by the Course of his Busi∣ness,
being call'd, on many Occasions, to visit
his Patients, make up Medicines, and give At∣tendance
on Physicians on the Sabbath Day,
all which were Works of Christianity, and with∣in
the very express Letter of Christ's Com∣mand,
who was Lord of the Sabbath; could
not be so exactly and literally strict in the Ob∣servance
of the Day, as to setting it apart for
religious Worship, as the Merchant might be.</ITEM>

<P>Now, as, I say both these were accidental to their
Business, and visible Callings, so they might, as
<PB N="9" REF="23"/>
above, cause some Difference in the Manner of
their Family Order; but they neither of them hin∣dred,
but that a strict Observance of religious Duties
was the general Design of both the Families, and of
the whole Tenour of their Practice.</P>
<P>The Apothecary's eldest Son, being put an Ap∣prentice
to this religious <HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, it was
little more than removing him out of one religious
Academy to another; for excepting the Difference
of the Business, he was still under the same religious
Government, had a Master who carried him on to∣wards
Heaven, in the same Way or Road, (as it
might be said) which he went in before; and as he
was, from his Childhood, soberly and religiously in∣clin'd,
he had all possible Encouragement and Assist∣ance
to be so still.</P>
<P>In the Course of Business, the Merchant sent him
over into <HI>Languedoc,</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where he had, for a
while, the Advantage of the Protestant Worship,
the Protestant Religion having not been then for∣bidden
in <HI>France;</HI> but it was soon after; and there he
had the miserable Occasion of seeing the Ruin and
Destruction of the Protestant Interest in <HI>France,</HI> their
King (<HI>Lewis</HI> XIV.) having at once revoked the fa∣mous
Edict of <HI>Nantes.</HI></P>
<P>On this sad Occasion, he received suitable Ideas
of Popish Cruelty, as by the same Means he did of
Popish Idolatry, of both which he entertain'd a just
Abhorrence in his Mind; and from thence, though
much Art was used with him by the Priests at <HI>Mar∣seilles,</HI>
to pervert him and draw him over from the
Protestant Faith, it was all in vain; their Cruelty
had given him such an Idea of their Religion, that
he could never be prevail'd with, by their Subtilties
and fair Means; But withal, It made him so uneasy
in his Business, which was then at <HI>Marsilles,</HI> that
he resolv'd to quit <HI>France,</HI> and accordingly he went
to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> where he lived several Years, and
<PB N="10" REF="24"/>
traded with good Success, whence he afterwards re∣turn'd
to <HI>England,</HI> and settled himself in <HI>London</HI>
marry'd, had no less than Seven Children, and bein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in very good Circumstances, as to Estate, he left o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Business, or, at least, the greatest Part of it, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
lived private, but in very good Figure and Fash<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on, in and near the City, till he was very old.</P>
<P>This being the General History of his Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
remains only to add, that after the Example of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Father, and of his Master, he was a most pious an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seriously religious Person; and shew'd it nor only b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Personal Behaviour, through the whole Series o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a long Life, as is said above; but, particularly, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the well ordering, and good Government of his Fa∣mily;
instructing, teaching, and educating his Chil∣dren
in the Paths of Virtue and Religion; in whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his own Example went a great way, and kept a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
equal pace with his Influence. But in particular h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
took up the very same Method of Family Order a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
his religious Father had done before him, (<HI>viz.</HI>) t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
make himself useful and agreeable to his Children
and to bring them, by the happy Pleasantness of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Temper, to delight in his Instructions, as well as to
be better'd by them; so that he made his Dictates be
as pleasant as profitable, and his Children took a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
much Delight to hear him discourse to them o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
solid, serious, and profitable Things, as others would
do in hearing a pleasant Tune, sung by a fine charm∣ing
Voice, or a good musical Instrument, touch'd
by a skilful Hand.</P>
<P>So exquisite was his Art in thus insinuating him∣self
into the Affections of his Children, that they de∣lighted
in him, and it added to their Taste of the
good Things he discoursed to them of; nor did his
Years lessen the Affection, or render his Society less
delightful to them, for he retain'd the Youth of
his Temper, even to the last, as he did the Strength
of his Memory.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="25"/>
His Skill, in the Choice of a Subject, which he
discoursed to them of, was no less delicate than the
exquisite Manner of his discoursing; he made every∣thing
pleasant and agreeable, by the extraordinary
Method he took to discourse of it; even the gravest
and most solemn Subjects were, by his artful Man∣ner,
made delightful to them to receive; and yet, at
the same Time, retained the Gravity and Solemnity
of their Nature; nor did his discoursing of them
lose or lessen the awful Reverence due to the most
sacred and majestick Things; for he was far from,
treating grave and serious Subjects with Levity, or
in a manner that would lessen the Dignity and Au∣thority
of Truth; but, on the other Hand, he did
not load the Subject with a heavy and troublesome
Ceremony, with dark and doubtful Expressions,
like the Heathen Rites, that were made Mystick,
loaded with Barbarisms, and uncouth horrid Gestures,
to fill the Mind with Horror, and so build a Reve∣rence
upon the meer Foundation of their being un∣intelligible.</P>
<P>On the contrary, while he gave sacred Things
their just Regard, and placed them at a due Distance
from Things ludicrous, or Things less serious, he
yet endeavour'd to place them in a true Perspective,
and in a Level with the Understanding; that his
Children might receive just Ideas of them, might
compleatly understand them, and might conceive of
them as they ought to be conceived of.</P>
<P>In this Manner he went on educating and breeding,
or bringing up, his Children in the Fear and Know∣ledge
of God, in the Love of Religion, and Divine
Truth, and in all the best and most improving Parts
of Human Knowledge, that he thought suitable to
make them wise and religious both together; accord∣ing
to the just Notions, and excellent Example of
his Father, and his Master, of which I have spoken
already.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="26"/>
Nor was his Success less encouraging, or the
Blessing of it less visible, than that of his Father; for
his Family was a little College, where the Youth
were happily introduced, and his daily Discourses to
them were like the publick Lectures in an University;
sometimes upon one Subject, sometimes upon ano∣ther;
sometimes upon religious Points; and of these,
sometimes the more Practical and Doctrinal Points,
at other Times Points in Controversy; in all which,
he studied to make his Discourses short, to bring
every Question into a narrow Compass, and to ex∣press
every Thing in few Words, plain and intelli∣gible,
suited to the Capacity and Understanding of
his Children; and to increase and widen those Ca∣pacities
too, that by understanding, they made them∣selves
more and more capable to understand.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when he undertook that Part with
his Children, as he was forced to do, on Account of
his eldest Son's being unhappily seduc'd; he took this
Way: He told his Children so many Stories of Po∣pery,
all of them true, vouched from the Papists own
Mouths, and the Practice of their own Champions,
that they laugh'd Popery, and their Popish Bro∣ther
too (who thought to convert them all) quite out
of the Family.</P>
<P>He took the same Course with Socinianism and
other Errors, and with the like Success: So that, in
a Word, mingling thus the serious and the comick,
he stript those Errors stark naked; brought his Chil∣dren
to entertain solid Truth, with a serious and so∣lemn
Steadiness of Resolution, and hiss'd their Oppo∣sitcs
off the Stage, pelting them with their own Dirt,
stisling them with their own Rubbish; till, in
short, instead of being perverted by their Brother,
they were made the happy Instrument of bringing him
back, to his Senses, and to receive and embrace again
the Truths, which he had so unhappily forsaken.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="27"/>
But he did not confine his Instructions to these
Controversies; the young Heads, who were under
his Care, required other Work also; they were to be
made wise as well as religious, and knowing of their
Way through the World, as well as the Way out of it:
'Tis true, he made Religion his first Work, and his
chief Care, as he knew it to be their chief Concern;
but he knew a useful Variety also would make all the
rest the more Entertaining; and therefore he wisely
mixt the pleasant with the profitable, and not dwelling
too much upon the grave and the solemn, he inter∣lac'd
it with other Things (in their Kind) also neces∣sary;
So he would talk one Day of Religion and the
Scripture, another Day of the World, and its De∣scription
by the Maps and Globes; one Day of Mo∣ral
Subjects, another of Things Philosophical; giv∣ing
them a View of natural Experiments, Disco∣veries,
and the like; sometimes of one Thing, some∣times
of another, but in all making Things easy
and natural to them, so that they always understood
what he said to them, and what he talk'd of, before
he left them, whatever they did before.</P>
<P>When he discoursed upon Moral Subjects, he di∣gested
all into an easy and familiar Stile, general∣ly
supporting his Discourses with some Examples,
either within their own Knowledge, as to Persons and
Things present and about them, or from Books.</P>
<P>He taught them History, especially Modern Hi∣story
and Geography; so that when any of the great
Affairs of the World abroad came before them, he
brought the Maps of those Parts of the World to
them, and shewed them where every Thing was done;
so that afterwards, if his Children, nay, his Daugh∣ters
as well as Sons, read any History, they would
keep the Maps and Globes before them, to observe
which Way the several Armies march'd, where the
Towns and Cities stood which were besieg'd, and how
reliev'd either by Land or Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="28"/>
Thus he fill'd their Heads with Knowledge, stor'd
their Minds with Understanding and judgment; and,
above all, fortified them in good Principles, and good
Morals, introducing them to the World with infinite
Advantage to themselves; and made them superior
to all the Children of their Years that were any
where to be found.</P>
<P>When he entred upon Controversies of any Kind,
and especially in religious Things, where the Prin∣ciples
he oppos'd were erroneous and heretical; he
studied to expose those Errors to the Understanding of
his Children, by bringing them into Story, repre∣senting
the Absurdity, and most scandalous Parts of
them, as in Picture and Perspective, Piece by Piece;
but always doing it faithfully, shewing the Doctrines
and Principles just as they were owned and practised
by those that professed them, and no otherwise; not
shewing them by any false Light, or cloathing them
with, any false Glosses of his own.</P>
<P>Plainness was, in his Opinion, the fairest Way to
deal with <HI>Errors in Religion,</HI> and the easiest Way al∣so
to convince any one's Judgment, that those
Things were really Errors: And so in particular,
he used to speak of the Errors of Popery, which he,
having lived Abroad and seen so much of, was a
very good Judge of.</P>
<P>He always said, there needed no other Art to ex∣pose
the Errors of Popery, than to dress them up in
their own Cloaths, paint them in their own Colours,
and express them in their own Words; then setting them
before the Eyes of the weakest Understanding, in the
open Day, and letting them but judge for themselves:
He used to say, that no Body would fall in Love
with the Whore of <HI>Babylon,</HI> if they were to see
her naked, wash the Paint off from her Face, and
pull the Feathers out of her Cap; that no Body
would be seduced with Popery, if they were to see
it stript of its false Robes, and shewn by Day-light.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="29"/>
That the best Way, therefore, to fight the Papists,
was to laugh at them, to expose them to the Ridicule
of the World, bring all their Trinkets and Trumpery
upon the Stage, and let the People see them.</P>
<P>Add to all that has been said, that he was a most
kind, tender, and affectionate Father to all his Chil∣dren;
sincerely aimed at, and faithfully pursued their
Good, both Soul and Body; and made it his whole
Study to oblige them, so far as they were to be
Oblig'd by Reason and good Usage; But still he kept
close to the main Point, namely, that it was for their
Good, and consistent with his Affection, that where
their Desires might, <HI>through their Mistake,</HI> tend to
their own Prejudice; there, <HI>and there only,</HI> his Duty,
even to themselves, demanded, that he should re∣strain
them; and yet, even this, he shewed evidently,
he did not do without Reluctance and Unwillingness,
and where Conscience, and a Sense of their Benefit
oblig'd him to do it.</P>
<P>His eldest Son, bred up with all these Advan∣tages,
was a very agreeable and promising Gentle∣man:
He had been introduc'd into the World in
very happy and easy Circumstances, and so as that,
having no Occasion, as he had no Inclination, to in∣gage
himself in the Hurries of Business, he had no∣thing
before him, but to live in the Fullness of com∣mon
Enjoyments, be easy, and improve both the
World and himself.</P>
<P>His Father had the Satisfaction of seeing, some
Years before his Son came to a full-grown Age, or,
<HI>as we call it,</HI> to Man's Estate, that his Inclinations
were sober; for that Part, if well inquired into,
may generally be discover'd early, and in the first
Steps which Youth ordinarily take after they have a
little of the Reins in their own Hands.</P>
<P>He found him inclined to Books, and applying
himself to manly, and masterly Studies, such as Hi∣story,
Astronomy, and several of the most useful
<PB N="16" REF="30"/>
Parts of the Mathematicks; and having gone through
a Course of Philosophy at the University, he (th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Father) found at his Return, that his Son brought
the Love of Learning with him, from, the Nurser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of it; that he gave himself very much up to the
Pursuit of Knowledge, and that not superficial an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
fashionable Knowledge, but to the Study of the be
and most valuable Things.</P>
<P>After he was assured of the Solidity of his Son
Temper, his Genius for Improvement, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
warm. Application to the best Studies, and particu∣larly
of his Virtue and Morals, he consented, the
not without great Importunity, to give him Leav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to travel, and, as it is commonly called, to see th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
World.</P>
<P>Before he went Abroad the old Gentleman, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Father, endeavoured to prepare his Mind for all the
ordinary Incidents of such an Undertaking, by sea∣sonably
warning him against the several Surprize
he might be in Danger of, and the Snares of Life
as well religious as others, which usually attende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
young Gentlemen in their travelling through the
several Countries he was to go through. His Father
was no Stranger to the World, having been bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Abroad, as I have said, lived some Years in <HI>Langue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
dock,</HI> and at <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and <HI>Leghoril;</HI> knowing th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mischiefs therefore which attended his Son, he took
the more Liberty to discourse very freely with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon the Subject of Travelling, and very often too<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the nearer his Time of going away came on.</P>
<P>He told him, That he was not so averse to he
Travelling, merely from his Fondness of his Compa∣ny;
tho' being the eldest Son he had, It was not th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
easiest Thing in the World to him to send him away
nor for the Hazards of the Journey, seeing the Pro∣tection
of Heaven, which he hop'd would be over
him, was equally his Safeguard in all Climates and
Countries; much less was it for the Expence, being
<PB N="17" REF="31"/>
satisfy'd that his Prudence would keep him within
the Bounds which he should consent to be prescrib'd
to; but that as he had liv'd abroad himself, and had
seen the ruinous Consequence of those Liberties, which
our <HI>English</HI> Youth (especially) give themselves Leave
to take, and withal the bad Principles which he
would continually converse among, he was greatly
anxious for both his Morals and his Religion.</P>
<P>He hinted to him, tho' very gently, that he had,
indeed, observ'd with Pleasure his Inclination seem'd
to lead him to a Life of Virtue; but that it was not
a little Abatement of his Satisfaction, that he seem'd
rather moral and sober, than religious; and added,
that really it was the most dangerous Thing in the
World for a young Gentleman, sober and virtuous,
to venture into <HI>Italy,</HI> till he was thoroughly ground∣ed
in Principle, and had fixt his Mind immoveably
in Matters of Religion; for that nothing was more
ordinary, than for such, either to be seduc'd, by the
Subtlety of the Clergy, to embrace a false Religion,
or by the Artifice of a worse Enemy, to give up all
Religion, and sink into <HI>Scepticism</HI> and <HI>Deism,</HI> or,
perhaps, <HI>Atheism.</HI></P>
<P>The young Gentleman listen'd with Respect to his
Father's Discrourse, especially to the first Part; and
gave him many Assurances, that he would have all
possible Regard to his Instructions, would keep with∣in
the Limits, as to Expence, which he should pre∣scribe
him; and that he would be always bound by
his Order where-ever he went. As to the last Part,
relating to Religion, he seem'd to wave it only with a
kind of common Notice, signifying, that he would
take Care of himself as much as was possible.</P>
<P>This was not the Subject of one or two, but of
many of his Father's Discourses with him; but as it
would take up too much Room in this small Tract, to
set down at large all the good Instructions which an
anxious and seriously religious Parent gave to a Son
<PB N="18" REF="32"/>
who he had so much Value for, and in a Case so
very important as that of sending him Abroad in the
World, so neither can I wholly omit them: Take,
then, the following, as some of the most earnest,
and, perhaps, the last of his Discourses, and which
I set down, as it may be of Use either to Fathers
on a like Occasion, or to young Gentlemen who go
Abroad and have no Fathers, or none so capable, to
instruct them.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Father is to be suppos'd now to be pre∣vail'd
with, after many Importunities, and the
Intercession of Friends, to consent to part with his
Son, tho' not without some Conditions and Limita∣tions
which he had thought fit to prescribe to him
for his Conduct abroad: he had, I say, yielded to
let him travel; but before it went so far as to make
any Preparation for his Journey, much less appoint∣ing
him the Time when he should set out, he took at
Occasion one Evening to discourse with him more
seriously, and more at large upon that Subject, that
he had ever done before: The Substance of which
Discourse you may take in the following Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Son, I find your Heart is very much
set upon this Ramble; I wish it may answer your
End; but I am very full of Thoughts about it
I am not half so easy in it as you are, or perhaps a
you think I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to see you so uneasy about it, Sir
I hope you shall have no Cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are more Causes for a Father's Uneasi∣ness
in it, than you perhaps can be sensible of; you
do not see the Dangers you are running into, it may
be, so well as I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see any Dangers in it at all, the com∣mon
Accidents of Life excepted, which we are safe
from no where: You have been abroad, Sir, and
you know the Dangers there, are no more than upon
an ordinary Journey in our own Country, nor hard∣ly
so many; I have heard you say so yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know but I may have been a little
too forward in talking so indeed, not thinking of
what now happens to be the Case; for I cannot say
neither, that travelling is so perfectly safe and free,
from Dangers abroad as it may be here: But, how∣ever,
those are not the Dangers that I am speaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you do not mean such Dangers, Sir, that's
another Case; indeed I see no other Dangers than are
at Home, except the Hazards of the Sea, and some∣times
of Robbers, Banditti, and Highwaymen, who,
I have been told, are not apt to be so generous
abroad as they are here; for sometimes, it seems,
they kill before they rob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I neither mean the Dangers of the
Sea, or of Highway Robbers; they do not al∣ways
kill before they rob: I was robb'd myself in
the <HI>Lyons</HI> Coach, which they call there <HI>La Diligence,</HI>
between <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Chalons,</HI> and I receiv'd no other
Injury than the Loss of my Portmanteau, and about
sixty Pistoles; the Fellows were very civil to us,
give them their due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are not always so, I doubt; we had a
sad Example of it upon some <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen in
<HI>France</HI> last Year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, they are not always so; but it is
then chiefly when the Passengers have Servants on
Horseback well arm'd, and have Fire-Arms them∣selves;
in which Case they begin the Battle before
<PB N="20" REF="34"/>
the Plunder; or on some other particular Occasions;
what the <HI>English</HI> Gentlemens Case was, I do not re∣member,
but that is not the thing, <HI>I tell you,</HI> that I
mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then. Sir, can you be so uneasy about?
I hope my Conduct has not been such at Home, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to make you fear I will go to ruin myself Abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say, neither, that my Fears are so
much for you on account of your Virtue; there are
but two Things Abroad to attack your Morals, and
they are Wine or Women; the first you will see no
Nations practise as we do here, and he that will be
sober at Home, seldom turns Drunkard when he
comes Abroad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you have not seen my Inclina∣tions
look that way; I mean to either Wine or
Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do my Anxieties point that way neither;
indeed, Son, I am more in Pain for your Religion
than your Morals, and that for many Reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I shall give you no occasion, Sir, to
be afraid of me on that account neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be glad to hope so too, but there may
be more Dangers that Way than you are yet aware
of; because you will have more Attempts made on
the Chastity of your Soul, than of your Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What kind of Attempts, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you will see as soon as you come to any
Place in <HI>Italy,</HI> or in <HI>France,</HI> or in <HI>Spain,</HI> for it is
much the same, you will there have a Specimen of
their Church Policy: And, first, the Priests come
immediately about you; they think it meritorious to
make a Proselyte, and they go about it in the artfullest
Manner imaginable; 'tis almost imposible to suspect
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Courses will they take, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, their Art, I say, is inexpressible; they
first insinuate into your Company, on pretence of
<PB N="21" REF="35"/>
your being a Stranger, they offer you all imaginable
Civilities, give you the utmost Respect, shew you
every thing that is rare and curious, wait upon you
to your Apartments, officiously serve you with the
greatest Diligence, and with such inimitable Courtesy,
so faithful, so assiduous, so apparently disinterested,
'tis impossible not to be obliged by them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear they will be so helpful, for
as a Stranger, one cannot be unwilling to be obliged,
especially since, Sir, you say they will do it faithfully,
and disinterestedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I say, apparently it is so; nor do
I say or suggest, that they have any real self-interested
View, I mean, for Gain, to make any personal Ad∣vantage
of you, or to get any thing from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Danger can there be then, Sir, either
of them, or from them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they will carry it farther, if you offer
them Money, they'll civilly refuse it, or ask you leave
to give it to the Poor before your Face.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they safe, then, as to Cheating or Frauds?
I thought quite otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just the contrary, and therein lies the Snare,
they will convince you, that they scorn to make the
least Advantage of you that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought they had been all Cheats and
Pick-pockets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing like it, that is to say, the particular
Sort of them that I speak of; they profess Poverty,
and a Contempt of Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This must be a Cheat, that they may at the
same Time make a Prey of a Stranger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it is a Cheat, I do not deny, and that
of the worst Kind; but their Designs are of a higher
Nature than that of Money: Nay, if they find that
you really want Money, they will frequently find
ways to supply you; and though they pretend to have
no Money themselves, they'll bring Gentlemen to
<PB N="22" REF="36"/>
you that shall generously lend you, nay, perhaps, give
you Sums of Money, as it were, in compliment to
your Occasion; and they'll do it with such a Pream∣ble,
such a handsome Introduction, telling you that
they find you are a Gentleman; that, perhaps, you
may be under some Disappointment; that 'tis not
their Business to inquire into your Occasions; but beg
you will be pleas'd to accept such a Trifle; that they
should be glad to receive the same Favour, if they
were Strangers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I have known them on such
Occasions, the Priest having first let them into the
Secret of it, put Twenty Pistoles into a Gentleman's
Hand, and tell him, he should oblige them, if he
Pleas'd to accept it, as a Loan far his present Occasions,
and that he might return it, if he thought fit, at his
leisure; or giving his Parole, that he would give
it to the Poor, when he came into Circumstances to
do it, and that he would take it for full Payment,
expressing himself religiously Charitable on that ac∣count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can there be any ill Design, Sir, in such
generous Things as these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they'll go further, they will ask you,
What Rout you think to take in your Travels? and
whether they may be farther serviceable to you? that,
if you think fit to trust them with letting them know
so much of your Affairs, (which, however, they do
not desire, but for your Service) they will give you
Letters to some of their Friends in this or that
Country (such as you shall mention) which shall be
no Disservice to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is, indeed, strangely obliging; can there
be any Deceit in such Behaviour as this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, all Cheat still, and the most dan∣gerous
of all Cheats: But I have not done with it,
for they will go farther than all this still.</P>
</SP>
<P>If you accept of the Offer, as, indeed, who can
decline it? and tell them the next City or the next
<PB N="23" REF="37"/>
Province you are bonnd to; they give you Letters
of Recommendation to such a Merchant, or, per∣haps
to a Person of Quality, in which they treat
you, as if you were their particular Friend, Intimate,
or even Relation; and that whatever Service they
do you, shall be received as done to themselves;
so that you are sure to be received like a Prince, and
treated with the utmost Distinction and Respect.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What harm, is it possible, there, can be in all
this, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in the first Place, the Priests View is to
convince you of their Piety, Sincerity, impartial
Beneficence, general Courtesy, disinterested Practice
in doing Good, and the like; that you, who have been
bred among Hereticks, and in Prejudices against their
Religion, and especially against their Orders, may be
convinc'd by such undeniable Proofs, that they are
not the People that they have been represented; that
they are not Murtherers and Thieves, but Christians;
and that they practise the Works of Charity, and
doing Good, without Distinction, to all Men, accord∣ing
to the blessed Rule of the Scriptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, even this has no Harm in it, for
no Man can be blam'd for desiring not to be misre∣presented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, if that was all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the rest is of the same kind, I should
think still, it must be very good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is still the Poison of Asps under their
Lips; there is a Snare laid deep as Hell under all
this; and that not to delude your Body, or dip into
your Purse, or to make a Gain of you; as I said
before, they act above all that; but to insnare the
Soul, and draw you into the Arms of their Church,
so to pervert your Principles, and deceive you every
way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can they think to pervert my Principles,
by doing Good?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="38"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is no Mystery at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do nor see into it, Sir, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is the very Reason of my Fear; there
is the main Danger I am warning you of; for if once
you see it, the Danger is over; you know the Text,
<HI>In vain is the Net spread in the Sight of the Bird.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge, if there is a Snare in all this,
'tis very well to be forewarn'd, for there is nothing
more dangerous than a Hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they are not Hypocrites neither; for,
first, their Habits tell you what they profess, and
the Artifice used, is to wheedle you into a good Opi∣nion
of their Profession; all that Part is real and above∣board.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where, then, Sir, can the Danger of them
lie?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is the Case; by all that officious
Kindness and Goodness, they first make their Ac∣quaintance
with you, and insinuating gradually, they
form an Interest in you, upon Point of Friendship
only: In this Friendship, having a large Share in
your Conversation, they carry it with the utmost Im∣partiality
between your Opinions and theirs; pretend
to value you for being true to your own Principles,
and strongly insist, that you cannot like them worse,
for the like Fidelity to theirs; and thus keeping things
upon a Balance, they act only the Friendship ab∣stracted
from Religion, for a great while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, does this assist their Design, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very much; for this breaks in upon your
Prejudices against them, as a cruel, a bloody, a false
and treacherous Generation, which yet you will be
sure to find them at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Prejudices, I believe, Sir, are too well
rooted to be easily removed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If yours are, and I hope it is so, yet every
one is not in the same Case: With these they carry
on the Profession of Friendship as high as possible,
<PB N="25" REF="39"/>
till, by innumerable Acts of Kindness and disinterested
Benefactions, such as I mentioned just now, they get
ground insensibly upon you; till they bring you, first,
into love with their Persons, and at last with their
Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, Sir, the Treatment you spoke of
just now, is extraordinary, and cannot fail to oblige;
it is impossible, almost, not to be in love with any
Gentleman, who should treat a Man in such a Manner
as that, and in a strange Country too; but then you
say, Sir, this is not the Priest, but some other Per∣son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, and a Person, to be sure, of no mean
Figure, for they never want such; nor does the
Gentleman himself do it with any seeret Design of
Fraud, but that I am speaking of, namely, the re∣ligious
Fraud; but being a Zealot too himself, and
Bigot enough to think it is meritorious, and will be
the Advantage of his Soul, to endeavour the saving
of yours, he is brought in by the Priest, as I said,
to act all this upon a mere Principle of supererrogating
Charity and Goodness, and therefore you are in no
Danger of any other Cheat in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The rest must be couch'd very close then, for
'tis cover'd with so much Christianity, and so much
generous Kindness, that I confess I cannot see thro'
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me go on with it then; for they will
carry it a great way farther yet, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, indeed, a little surpriz'd with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have received the Bounty offer'd
you, supposing you had Occasion of it, you can do
no less than acknowledge the generous Favour;
perhaps, Justice will move you to offer to give a Note
under your Hand, or Acknowledgment, or Obligation
for it, or, perhaps, a Bill of Exchange, according
as your own Circumstances may admit, for I am not
speaking just of Your Circumstances in particular,
<PB N="26" REF="40"/>
but of the ordinary Cases that may happen to any
Gentleman-Stranger on such an Occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand it, Sir, just as I believe you mean;
no doubt I should make such an Offer: any Man
that had a Sense of the thing, would do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, he is sure to refuse it with the same Ge∣nerosity,
and 'tis ten to one, but he talks to you thus:
No, Sir, no, by no means; I don't desire any Re∣compence:
Our holy Religion teaches us not to give,
in order to receive again; if your Circumstances re∣quire
it as a Gift, there is one that will take care of my
Payment (pointing to the <HI>Padre,</HI> who, he suggests, will
record his Charity in Heaven for him) and if you are
above the want of it, Sir, I take your Word of Honour
for it, that yon will pay unto <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> to whom I
assign the Loan, by giving it in his Name to such of
his poor Servants as your own Charity shall direct,
and as his Grace shall lay in your Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is still a Prodigy of sincere Charity,
and seems so founded on the Cnristian Doctrine, that
'tis hard, so much as to suspect it: But pray, Sir, be
pleas'd to go on with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you have acquainted them where you
purpose to go next; suppose you were before at <HI>Turin,</HI>
and design next to go to <HI>Genoa,</HI> or take it where else
you will, the next Day the Gentleman is sure to send
the <HI>Padre</HI> or Priest to you, to desire you to dine with
him, or to meet him, in the Refectory of the Abbey,
which is as much as to say, I invite you to dine with
the Priest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay we with Safety, eat with them in their
Religious Houses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, they treat you there with the utmost
Civility; you have not, perhaps, all the Formalities
of a Feast; but you have what we call a Cold Treat,
with abundance of Conserves, Sweetmeats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
the best Wine, to be sure, that is in the Country:
the Gentleman gives you his Letters of Recom∣mendation
<PB N="27" REF="41"/>
to the Eminent Person he promised, and
you are sure to have it in all the Terms of Civility
imaginable; and as to Money, 'tis a mere Letter of
Credit to you, without so much as asking whether
you want it or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all strange indeed, Sir; but does he not
tell me, that there is a borrowing Clause in the Letter,
and that 'tis, as you say, Sir, a Letter of Credit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not directly; but when he puts it into
your Hand, he will say, Sir, my Friend will not let
you want any thing your Occasions may call for, if
you shew him this Letter; so dismisses you with all
possible Civilities, desiring the Favour of your Cor∣respondence
in your Travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and then I am gone, Sir; and yet I do
not see the Harm you were pleased to say there was in
all this: Where lies the Plot of it all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall bring you on to it gradually, Son, as
they do: When the Gentleman has thus taken his
Leave of you, the <HI>Padre</HI> comes to you, and begs
the Favour of you, that you will take a Letter or
two from him in your Pocket; that you will permit
your Servant to deliver them when you come to
<HI>Genoa,</HI> intimating that one of them, which he shews
you in particular, is to a Brother of their Order,
who, he knows, will think it a Favour, if you will ac∣cept
of the usual Civilities of their Profession, and
will be sure to shew you all the Rarities of the Place,
and, in a Word, to pay to you all the Respect possible,
as you are a Stranger. The Gentleman having dis∣charged
his Civilities, as I told you, has taken his
Leave and is gone, and the good <HI>Padre,</HI> with, per∣haps,
another, entertains you afterwards; carries you
all over the House, shews you how religiously they
spend their Hours, and yet how agreeably they live;
and then brings you into his Cell, where he regales
you with Sweetmeats again, and Wine; then shews
you his Books, if he has any, for as the House has a
<PB N="28" REF="42"/>
publick Library, the Priests have not always many
Books of their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is very well yet, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here he takes Occasion to enter into Discourse
with you upon any Subject, such as by his former
Conversation he finds most suited to your Genius,
whether of Philosophy, or Physick, or History, or
Politicks; talks of the War, if any upon the Stage,
or if not, of the last that have been, and of the In∣terest
of the several Parties; still avoids any Discourse
of Religion; but fails not to tell you, that he shuns
it in good Manners to your being of a different Opini∣on;
not but that he prays devoutly to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI>
and with that he lifts up his Eyes and Hands, that
you should be inspired by Divine Grace, to come in∣to
the Pale of the Church, and to embrace the Ca∣tholick
Faith, adding, with an Air of Affection, how
sensibly it touches him, that so fine a Gentleman as
you, and of so bright a Genius, should be so long
before the heavenly Illumination should reach your
Soul; and that, however, he is assur'd you shall be
bless'd from Christ, with saving Inspirations in his
due time: This is very good, you will say, in its
kind; and it is so, and I may venture to say of some
of them, that they think as they speak; however,
even this he brings in very seldom, and never but as
if forc'd from him by the Discourse you were upon,
and he always ends it with asking your Pardon for
the Excursion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to observe there is some Subtlety in
all this, Sir; but it seems all to be very friendly and
sincere: supposing we are to grant they believe them∣selves
in the right Way, and in the only right Way
to Heaven, I cannot see any Evil in it yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not charge them with Evil, they compass
Sea and Land to make a Proselyte; but the Evil lies
in the Effect of it upon you, or the Person I am
supposing to be the Object; the Mischief is in the
<PB N="29" REF="43"/>
Danger of being seduc'd by this Excess of Kindness
and Charity, to enter into the Merits of their Cause,
and to commence Disputes; which they always chuse
to fix upon the less disputed Points of Religion, en∣deavouring
to let you suggest that it is the same Jesus
they worship, which we also acknowledge; how or∣thodox
and uniform they are in their Belief of his
Deity, and their Adoration of his Person; and, at
last, what little Difference there is between us and
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Sir, is always supposing a Man will
enter into the Debate with them; not else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very difficult to avoid it, at least now and
then a little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, as I said before, this is but for a
Day or two, or a Week, or as long as I stay in the
Place; but the next Day or two, perhaps, I am
gone; and then there is an End of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are quite mistaken; they begin the Work,
and the Compliment made you by the Gentleman,
intangles you yet farther when you come to <HI>Genoa;</HI>
for at the same time that you are loaded afresh with
new Civilities from the Person you are recommended
to, he is secretly advertis'd that the Religeuse have been
with you; that's enough, the Meaning is, they have
made some Progress, have Hopes from the Goodness
of your Disposition to prevail; and he understands
the rest, <HI>viz.</HI> that he should set some more upon you:
Besides this, the Letters the Priest gave you to deli∣ver
to some of the Brotherhood, fail not to have
this Expression, Pray omit not to do all the good
Offices of Civility to this Gentleman, which, as he
is a Stranger and a Gentleman, Hospitality requires.
He gives you this Letter open, that you may see
what he writes; and tho' you see nothing to give
you the least Intimation of their Design, they per∣fectly
understand one another; nay, at the Place of
signing the Letter, they always make the Sign of the
<PB N="30" REF="44"/>
Cross with the Name; and the Padre to whom it is
written knows the Meaning of it exactly, only by
observing either the Place where it is so set, or the
Number of Crosses, or some other particular Mark
about it; as suppose instead of a plain Cross thus †,
it shall have the Addition only of a Dot or Speck, as
if dropt by Accident from the Pen, thus†; by that
Part of the Cross where the Speck lies, the Person
perfectly understands his Meaning, and there he
intimates that he has made some Progress and Hopes
for Success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This indeed, Sir, intimates that they carry on
the same Design every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does so; and as they suppose that the Cen∣tre
of your Travel is, for some time at least, ap∣pointed
at the Vatican, this Strain of Civility never
leaves you till you come to <HI>Rome;</HI> and you are thus
recommended from City to City, and, as it were,
loaded with Kindnesses and good Offices to the very
Place: There you are presently surrounded with
new Favours, and carry'd to all the publick Places,
shew'd all the Rarities, and even the Pope himself;
and particularly you are introduc'd to some of the
Cardinals, the Favourite, in especial Manner, by
whom you are receiv'd in a Manner so obliging, that,
in a Word, 'tis no small Hazard that you are over∣come
with the Caresses and Compliments of these
People in Matters of Conversation only, and they
send away many a Gentleman even proselyted by
their Favours; nor is it often that they fail to make
Impressions upon those which they attack in this
Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see into it now indeed, Sir; it is certain they
manage with a Perfection of Art and Subtlety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Add to this, that all the while you stay at
<HI>Rome,</HI> you see the Pomp and Glory of their Religi∣on,
which even in itself goes a great Way, and
makes great Impression on the Mind; as no doubt
<PB N="31" REF="45"/>
the Magnificence and immense Riches of the Temple
of <HI>Solomon</HI> did upon the Nations adjoining to <HI>Judea,</HI>
to bring Proselytes to their Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That might do in those Days, Sir, perhaps,
more than it does since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It preys upon uninstructed Minds; many are
in Love with the Pomp of Religion; and when they
are not well grounded in the Simplicity of the Gospel,
are easily drawn aside.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope there is no Danger of me, Sir, in that
Point; you have not brought me up in Ignorance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That reproaches me very severely; for I have
not added so much to your religious Instruction as I
should have done, and as I might have done, if I
had been careful of my Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you have been very careful of me,
Sir; have you not given me the Advantage of a libe∣ral
Education, and sent me to the great Nursery of
Learning the University? Tho' it is true I want a
great deal; yet whatever I want, it is not my Fa∣ther's
Fault, but my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say that, Son: 'Tis true, I sent you to
the University; but I doubt tho', we may rather call
it a Nursery of Learning than of Religion: I like
their Philosophy better than their Divinity; they
make more Scholars than Christians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true that there is not so much Care
of the religious Principles of the Youth who study
there, as there might be, yet a Man may gain a
Fund of orthodox Principles there, if he will apply
to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We won't dispute that now, Son; but De∣monstration
is on my Side: how many well-read
Atheists, and learned Hereticks, do we see come
finish'd in Error from the Universities, and begin to
propagate corrupt Doctrines as soon as they come
from the Schools? But that is not the Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="46"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it then, Sir? What would you have
me say to this Point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is the Bottom indeed of all my Discourse;
It is, in short, this, That, as I know you will not
fail to be attack'd with all possible Artifice, as I have
said, in order to wheedle you out of your own Opi∣nion,
or, at least, into a good Opinion of theirs;
so you, or any one else, who have any Value for
the true Religion, ought not to go abroad, till they are
thoroughly fortify'd against the Subtlety and Artifice
of the craftiest People in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>How must any Body be thoroughly fortify'd,
Sir? It must be a special Work upon the Mind, and
wrought there by a superior Hand, that must, and
only can, effectually fortify the Soul against the Delu∣sions
of Error.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear you say so, Son; you
are very right, and 'tis the Spirit of God alone; that,
as he is the Comforter and the Sanctifier of his Peo∣ple,
so is he their Instructor, their Guide into all
Truth, and their Keeper in the Truth, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 13.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This then being the Case, what need we fear
the Delusions of Error, and the Insinuations of the
Priests? I do not see what I have to do, but to be
forewarn'd, as you are pleas'd to do, and leave the
rest to a higher Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is more than that to be done; for
I think you huddle Things up too close, and bring it
all into too narrow a Compass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand you, Sir: If there be
any thing else, I desire to know it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is for this Reason that I desir'd to talk with
you: I shall explain myself in several Particulars,
and such as I shall expect you to think immediately
upon.</P>
</SP>
<P>1. No young Gentleman ought to travel into Coun∣tries
of different Religions, till he is thoroughly ground∣ed
in the Principles of his own.</P>
<SP>
<PB N="33" REF="47"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how, Sir, must I understand the Words
thoroughly grounded?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad you ask me that Question. By
being thoroughly grounded in his Principles, I
mean,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That he is a compleat Convert to Religion in
general, (<HI>viz.</HI>) fully convinc'd of the Being of
God, the Object of all Religion; fully con∣vinc'd
that every Man ought to be of some
Religion or other, that so he may pay his
natural Homage to God, in the best Manner
he is able, and in the Way most agreeable to
his Will, and thankfully satisfied that the Re∣ligion
he professes is that one and only best,
which is so suitable to the God he is to wor∣ship,
and will be accepted by him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That he has so well informed himself of this,
that he is able to defend the Principles he has
entertain'd, and to give an Account of his
Faith where-ever he comes, and in the Teeth
of Gainsayers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That tho' he may not be able so far to ma∣nage
a Dispute, in Defence of his Principles,
as to overthrow all that oppose him, yet, that
he may be able so to defend them, as to under∣stand
himself, and not to receive a Shock in
his Faith, for not being able to baffle the So∣phistry
of every cavilling querulous Priest that
may attack him.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>In a Word, he should be fully persuaded of the
Truth of the Protestant Religion, and steadily re∣solv'd
in the Faith of it, otherwise he ought never
to venture himself Abroad: But, take this with you
<PB N="34" REF="48"/>
too, that he is not to reject the Teaching, and
Guiding, of a superior Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say, indeed, that I may be able to
answer and confute all the Priests, or other Champi∣ons,
of the Popish Religion; for I have never set up
for a Casuist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' you could not confute them, it would
be necessary for you to keep them from confuting
you; for it will be very hard for you to continue of
any Opinion that you cannot defend, or not to be
of that Religion which you cannot confute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is more, indeed, in that, Sir, than I
had yet thought of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is so much in it, that I should be very
loth to give my Consent for your going abroad, till
you have taken some Steps in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you please to have me do, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the first Thing, I mean, as to Human
Means, is this: I would have you take some Pains
with your self, and study, a little, the Controversy
between Popery and the Protestant Religion. I
have a great many very good Tracts, in my Library,
wherein, all that has or can be said, on both Sides,
is, I believe, summ'd up, and disputed. Take some
Time, and make your self fully Master of the great
Questions between us; the Doctrine of Transubstan∣tiation;
of Image-Worship; the Absurdity of ado∣ring
the Relicks of dead Saints; Human Pardons,
for Offences against Divine Power, and, which is
still more absurd, buying those Pardons for Money;
also, selling Indulgences, and Licences, to sin
against God; a few of these will furnish you, Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you were saying, just now, That there
is some Danger from the Pomp, and Gaiety, of Po∣pery,
when we come into those Countries, where it
is all so fine, and so rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Son, I know it has been fatal to some
weak Heads; but, I think, a little Stock of Re∣flection
<PB N="35" REF="49"/>
will furnish you against that: I have seen
all the Legerdemain of the Priests, and of their
Worship; and, I must say, that if the Subtlety of
the Priests, their Sophistry in Argument, and the
Use they make of those pompous Things, does not
insnare and captivate the Mind, I am persuaded,
very few Protestants would ever be perverted by
what they should see; for that, (I mean in their
publick Worship) especially, take it in the Gross, and
particularly as practised Abroad, 'tis such a Piece of
Pageantry, such a Puppet Show of Religion, that
nothing of a well instructed Mind can be in any
Danger from the Sight of it; it would make a Man of
Sense rather despise and abhor them, especially, when
he is, I say, prepar'd to do so by proper Advices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you please to direct me to,
Sir, in order to prepare my Thoughts beforehand,
so as to make a right Judgment of these Things,
when I come to see them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you propose the Question in that
Manner, for this is bringing the Business into as
narrow a Compass as we can: I'll lay down a Scheme
for you in a few Words.</P>
<P><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Bestow a little Reading upon the Original of
the Christian Religion, and enter into the Chro∣nology
of Things, from the first planting the
Gospel in the World.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Then enter distinctly into the History of the
Primitive Times, and there you will see, very
clearly, 1. In what Purity the Christian Doc∣trine
was first preach'd; what it really is, and
what the first Christians practis'd. 2. By what
Degrees it became corrupt; how Error, Ido∣latry,
Superstition, Enthusiasm, and the Doc∣ctrine
of Devils crept in; all which were sup∣ported,
as they were introduced, by Church
<PB N="36" REF="50"/>
Tyranny, and abominable Imposition, which
is the Essence of Popery.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Then make your self Master of the Protestant
Doctrine, the Principles which we profess; the
Reason and Foundation of them; how esta∣blish'd
in Truth; directed by, and founded in
the Holy Scriptures; confirmed by the Writings
and Practice of the Primitive Fathers of Christi∣anity,
and sealed with the Testimony of their
Blood.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Then look into the History of the Reforma∣tion,
and see the Reason why, and the Manner
how, the first Reformers broke off from the
<HI>Romish,</HI> which was then call'd, tho' falsly, the
universal Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If you look into these four Particulars, and search
impartially into the Original of Truth, you will
find this the best Way to confirm your Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a Study, that requires a grave Ap∣plication,
and long Time: I believe you do not
design me, Sir, for a Clergyman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a little short upon me, <HI>Son;</HI> I do not
design to make a Priest of you, it's true, but I
would make a Christian of you, and every Christian
Man ought to study Principles: I hope you do not
think that the Study of Truth belongs only to the
Clergy, and that we are to apply to them only for
our Knowledge of it; that's Popery, indeed, in the
very Abstract.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think we should go to them in plain
Cases, but, in disputed Points, I think they, whose
Business it is to study those Things, should be always
ready to instruct their People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they should, but their People too should
endeavour to be able to judge of the Instructions
<PB N="37" REF="51"/>
they give, as you seem to do now (and a little too
far, I think,) of my plain Advices</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not offend you, Sir: But if they are not
our Teachers in difficult Cases, what Business have
they with us, or we with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, a great deal, they are Teachers, and we
ought to listen to their Teaching; but not so as to
give up our Senses to their <HI>Positives,</HI> or <HI>Negatives,</HI>
and look no farther: Even our blessed Saviour, the
only infallible Teacher that ever was on Earth, re∣fers
us even beyond himself, and bids his Disciples
search the Scriptures, <HI>For they,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>are
they which testify of me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should, indeed, Sir, desire to be satisfied
that the Clergyman I talk with, is an honest disinte∣rested
Man, and then I should be apt to depend very
much upon what he says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are as fit to be turn'd into a Papist,
as a Popish Emissary could wish to talk with, and
this is the very Thing I have been speaking of. I
am very sorry my Discourse has made no farther Im∣pression
than this upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will hear the Reasons of
what I say, before you draw such a hard Conclusion.
I think, Sir, in the first place, an honest Man will
not impose upon any Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Son, these are honest Men; at least
I'll suppose they are, and that they do not go about
to impose upon you: they believe themselves to be in
the Right, and 'tis a very honest Principle if we are
first satisfied we are right, to endeavour to bring
others to be so too; why else do all People bring
up their Children in their own Way? you cannot
suppose they would willingly impose upon their own
Children, and deceive them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are Arguments on my Side; I shall
always believe I am safe with such People as will not
designedly impose upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="38" REF="52"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they may be mistaken in the Articles
they persuade to, and then their being honest makes
them the more dangerous, for having been impos'd on
themselves, they impose upon you in mere Charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where then shall any Man be safe, if he is
in Danger from honest Men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honest Men may not always embrace honest
Principles, they may be deceiv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must be as cautious as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think that shews a great Indifference in the
Case, as if it was of small Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I have done all that I can, Sir, I must
venture it, or not go Abroad at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had much better not go Abroad at all,
than to go Abroad among Enemies, and be unpro∣vided
for your Defence; 'tis going blindfold into a
<HI>Bear-garden.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you disappoint me, Sir, in the main
Part of my Education; which depends much upon
this Proposal of Travelling, and which you had al∣ready
consented to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did consent to your Travelling, but hop'd
you would not have made a Difficulty of my giving
you needful Cautions to prevent the Ruin of your
Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not oppose being caution'd; but, Sir,
the Proposal, you make, is the Work of an Age:
I ought to lock my self up in a Study seven Years
for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, nor one Year, nor half a Year; I
would propose but six Months for you, provided you
would give some Application to it for that six
Months, and look up to God to give Assistance to
your Enquiries, and to add the Divine Illuminations
of his Spirit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, the last of it self would be sufficient
without the first; the Divine Teaching is able to open
the Understanding without Study.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="53"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Son; but you really bring that
Argument as if it were to excuse the Application;
I should be glad my Suggestion could be call'd un∣just;
God's Grace attends the ordinary Means, and
seldom acts by Miracles: Inspirations are very much
ceased, if not quite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you may venture me, Sir, upon the
Force of the Cautions you have already given.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! upon that Foot, that you suppose ho∣nest
Men will never impose upon you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think otherwise, unless where I see
them evidently mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! and how shall you see that, but
by entering a little into the State of the Case be∣tween
them and you, between the Protestant and
the Papist? that is, the very Thing I argue upon;
that you may put your self into a Capacity to judge
whether they are wright or wrong, mistaken or not
mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I am sufficiently prepar'd: I am not
an utter Stranger to the Controversy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, I see evidently, you do not lay so much
Stress upon it, as I think the Case requires; you
think there's no Danger, and that's the very Essence
of Danger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say, there is no Danger, Sir; but,
as I resolve to be as cautious as I can, I hope the
Danger is not so great, and, I am for venturing, if
you please, unless you positively forbid me, which,
I hope, you will not, after having promised me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my Concern, for your Good, that makes
me afraid; but, I see, you make light of the Adven∣ture,
which makes me still like it the worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not dispute with my Father; but I
must say, I see no great Hazard in it: and it would
be unkind to put a Stop to my Travels on such a
Scruple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="54"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor would I dispute with my Son, in a
Thing I see him so bent upon; but I may have the
Privilege to persuade, I hope, without being thought
unkind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you only persuade, Sir, you give a Li∣berty
to me to chuse; but you seem to persuade with
the Solemnity of a Command.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Son, since you think it a Hardship, I
shall not Command, if you are resolv'd to go, after
all the Cautions I have given you, only remember,
that your Father did warn you, and used his utmost
Endeavours to persuade; I am sorry you will run
the Risque.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I see no Risque in it, that is of
Force enough to ballance the many Advantages of
Travelling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And indeed. Son, I see much the more Ha∣zard
in it for that very Reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, however, if you please, I am in∣clin'd
to venture; I hope, when I return, you will
be of another Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I believe, when you return, you will be
of another Mind too; for, I expect to see you go
out a Protestant, and come back a Papist; I think
you go out as if you were preparing your self
for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you may live to see your self
mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I see it too plainly; an indifferent
Protestant is half a Papist, ready form'd; the Priests
Work is done to their Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not indifferent, Sir; but, I do not (it
may be) lay all the Stress of Life upon that Dispute:
I think my only way not to be misled, is not to enter
into any Dispute with them about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say you should enter into any Di∣sputes
with them, I rather say you should carefully
avoid it, because of the Subtlety and Sophistry of
<PB N="41" REF="55"/>
the People you will have to deal with; but a
Man would be able to defend himself, as I said be∣fore,
for his own Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well satisfied already.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Speaking with an Air of Coldness, and Slight.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Son, since you treat the Subject so
coldly, let me ask you a close Question upon the
Subject of Religion in General: You have read the
Scriptures, you have been taught the Principles of
Religion in your Catechism, you have not been edu∣cated
in Atheistical Notions, or bred up to a Con∣tempt
of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't shew any Contempt of Religion, Sir,
as I know of, in any of my Discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but let me come to my Question; How
do you understand Religion as it relates to the Life
of Man? Is it the chief or ultimate Concern <HI>of Life?</HI>
or is it only an Accident <HI>to Life?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is as we make it to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is too true in Fact, but my Question
does not relate to the Fact, but to the Right; not
what we make it, but what we ought to make it,
what it really is in its own Right, and what we
ought to esteem it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we often make more Show of Reli∣gion
than we need to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you, Son, do not shuffle with the Que∣stion;
I am not disputing with you, but sincerely
endeavouring to inform you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not desire to dispute, and am not back∣ward
to be informed, where I am ignorant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry you are willing to appear more, ig∣norant
than you are; and yet, I cannot but say, you
are in this main Point more ignorant than I thought
you had been: I will therefore turn my Question in∣to
a Proposition, and not to catechise, but to inform
you; I hope, tho' you are past the first, you will
allow your Father the Liberty of the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="56"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very willing, as I said before, to be
informed if I am ignorant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are not ignorant, <HI>as I said before,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
you are cold and indifferent, 'tis the same Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
this Case; only that the latter is the worst; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
shall speak of that afterward: In the mean Time
take my Thoughts about Religion, thus:
<Q><P>The Belief of the Being <HI>of a God</HI> is the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
Principle; 'tis the first Truth Nature dictates<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
That a Homage is due to that <HI>God,</HI> as the firs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and Supreme Power, is the next.</P>
<P>The Manner how that Homage is to be paid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is the third; and this we call Religion.</P></Q></P>
<P>As the Supreme Power, so acknowledged, is, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
must necessarily be our ultimate End, because h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is and was our first Cause; so paying the Homag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
due to him, is the undoubted Debt and Duty of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Nature; and consequently, the performing it in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
right Manner, <HI>which is Religion,</HI> is, and ought to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the most important Article of Life.</P>
<P>Thus, Son, by short and necessary Consequences<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
I form a Proposition, which I offer to your Reason<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
deny it if you can.</P>
<P>That Religion, or the right worshipping of God,
is the most important Article of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not pretend, Sir, to dispute with my
Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Son, I am not drawing you to dispute▪
here is no Room for it; here is nothing doubtful o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
disputable.</P>
</SP>
<P>If you deny my Proposition, that the right per∣forming
our Homage to God is of such Importance,
you must deny the Homage it self to be a Debt.</P>
<P>If you deny the Homage to be due, you must
deny the Person to whom it is due to be Supreme▪
<PB N="43" REF="57"/>
for the Supreme must claim a Right to our Submis∣sion,
which is Homage.</P>
<P>If you deny him to be Supreme, you must deny
him to be Prior, the first Cause and Creator of our
Being; for whatever is before all, must be above
all.</P>
<P>If you deny him to be the first Cause of Being,
you must deny him to be GOD; for, whatever is
before all Being, must Be and Exist infinitely, and
in himself; and whatever is Infinite and Self-existent,
must be GOD.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no Answer, Sir; I am to hear you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The System is perfect, it is a Chain of Con∣sequences;
there is no Room for an Answer, unless,
as above, you will deny Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope I am no Atheist, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I hope so too, and I go upon that
Supposition; let me then proceed.</P>
<Q><P>If Religion is the chief Concern of Life, the
most important Article, and on which our
Eternal Felicity depends; then it is of the ut∣most
Consequence to us, that we be thorough∣ly
and rightly informed concerning this Thing
called <HI>Religion;</HI> and that more especially, be∣cause
fatal Mistakes, Errors, and Heresies, are
crept into the World about it, and that there
is a false as well as a true Religion.</P>
<P>By being rightly informed concerning Religion,
I mean this short Point, <HI>viz.</HI> That when we
pay that Homage to the Great Supreme
Power, and which, as I mentioned above,
we acknowledge to be our Debt and Duty, we
should do it in such a Manner as is agreeable
to his revealed Word and Will; or, <HI>in short,</HI>
so as he will be best pleased with it: And this,
whether it respects, (1.) What we are to be∣lieve
<PB N="44" REF="58"/>
concerning him; or (2.) What we are
to do and perform in Worshipping and Obey∣ing
him.</P></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, we find the World infinitely divided
in their Opinions about these Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That does not at all lessen the Importance of
our being at a Certainty about them, but increases
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I grant it does not lessen it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Son; then still my Proposition stands
unmov'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>Religion</HI> is the most impor∣tant
Article of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I do not pretend to oppose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; then my Son will allow, I hope,
that I have great Reason to lay all the Stress imagi∣nable,
upon what I was persuading him to, <HI>namely,</HI>
to be thoroughly fixed in his Principles, in this im∣portant
Thing called RELIGION, before he ventures
Abroad among those who, professing erroneous and
mistaken Opinions themselves, will use their utmost
Skill and Cunning to pervert and deceive him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too many for me, Sir; I said before,
I would not dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, It is not that I am too many for
you; it is the Energy of this weighty Truth, <HI>That
Religion is the main Concern of Life;</HI> 'tis that which
bears down all before it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But were it less demonstrable, yet, your Way
of arguing is too strong for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' that's a Compliment upon your Father,
'tis a Satyr upon your self, in the very Case before
me; for if an artful Way of disputing may over∣come
you, tho' in a Case less demonstrable; <HI>Ware
Popery!</HI> That is the very Thing that I said above; The
Subtlety and Sophistry of the Priests may be too many
for you: How then could you say, There was no
Danger?</P>

<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not say there was no Danger, but that
I was inclined to venture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if then you own the Danger, and
that in a Case of the highest Importance, why are
you inclin'd to venture? This brings me to the other
Part, Namely, That I see in you a fatal Indifference
in a Thing of the highest Consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it does not argue, I hope, Sir, that you
should pass such a severe Conclusion upon it, that I
should therefore turn Papist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I cannot think the Conclusion was
severe, tho' I did not say directly you would turn
Papist; but I must acknowledge, I should expect it,
if you went Abroad with such an Indifference, as
you seem to have, about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I perceive still, you design to disappoint
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Son, that is not just; I propose needful
Preparations, you decline them as troublesome, and
would argue their being needless; I have proved the
Affirmative, if you decline to qualify your self, you
disappoint your self, 'tis not I do it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It lies before you, you may go or stay, as you
please; but I must act as I direct you to act; I
must not act against Principle: If you will travel
Abroad into Popish Countries, without being arm'd
against Popish Delusions, without being acquainted
with Popish Errors, and well grounded in Protestant
Truths; you must do it when you are out of the
Bounds of my Influence, and are no more under
your Father's Authority; but while it is other∣wise,
I must Invade Principle and Conscience,
lay aside all Affection to you as a Father, and all
Regard to your eternal Felicity, if I should come
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
into it; I cannot do it: you must not expect it of
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot go to School again at this Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you may study the Scripture at any
Age; you may read Ecclesiastic History, and look
into the Chronology of the World, and inquire into
the Reason of Things; no Age is too far gone for
Men to search into Truth, or to inform themselves
of what has been done in Ages past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's University Work too; it's too late
now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Son, if it be <HI>too late for you</HI> to establish
your self, in Matters of the utmost Importance, it
would be much <HI>too soon,</HI> I must tell you, <HI>for me</HI> to
send you Abroad into the World without it; I can∣not
do it, take it as you please.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here the Son broke off the Discourse a little rude∣ly,
murmuring at the Thing as unkind in general;
intimating, that he would find a Way to go Abroad
without so much Ceremony: All which, the Father,
acting with Prudence, not willing to ruffle his Tem∣per,
and put him upon any rash Resolutions, took
no Notice of.</P>
<P>However, the short History of that Part was this;
That applying himself to an Uncle, his Mother's
Brother, and to some other Relations, they over-per∣suaded
his Father, at length, to let him go Abroad,
which he did, tho' with great Reluctances; and
which, as he often said, with a sincere Sorrow after∣wards,
was against the strongest Conviction of his
Conscience; foreboding to himself, that if ever he
went Abroad, he would come back again entirely
ruined in his Principles; and so it prov'd.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, for his Son not only turn'd Pa∣pist,
by a Delusion of an <HI>English</HI> Priest, who he
found at <HI>Chaalons</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and who travelled with
him from thence into <HI>Italy;</HI> I say, he not only turn'd
<PB N="46" REF="61"/>
Papist himself, and as his Father believed, tho' he
would never acknowledge that Part, had taken Or∣ders;
but after his Return, he applied himself, with
his utmost Skill and Cunning, to draw over his Two
younger Brothers, and, especially, one of' his Sisters,
to follow his Example; till his Father, after many
a sore Battle with him in Argument, was oblig'd to
dispose him out of his Family, and almost forbid
him coming to his House for a Time; but he did
hot keep quite away, as you shall hear in its Order.</P>
<P>After he was gone, the Father apply'd him∣self,
with his utmost Diligence, to the Instruction of
the rest of his Children, in order to fortify them
against the Attacks which their Popish Brother had
made upon their Principles; and in which, he had
Difficulty enough, tho' at length he effectually ma∣stered
it all.</P>
<P>When he first set about this necessary Work, he
was greatly perplexed with the Obstinacy, and even
Impertinences, of his eldest Son, who made it a
Piece of Conscience to pervert the Family; and to
that End, his greatest Application was still to counter∣act
all the good Foundations which his Father had
lodg'd, by his most early Instructions, in the Minds
of his Children, and to persuade them into a Belief
of the contrary Doctrines, upon the Authority of
what he called an infallible Interpreter of Scripture,
namely, the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>This he did with such Subtlety and Art, and had
so far insinuated himself into their weaker Judg∣ment,
that the Father found it very difficult to weed
out the Tares which his Son had sown, and found,
by sad Experience, that Errors are not only sooner
planted in the Minds of Men, than Truth; but that,
like Weeds in a Garden, being the Natives of the
Soil, they take a deeper Root, and are not so easily
cleared out again, as the more solid Truths which
had been established there before.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="62"/>
Upon this Account, he took Two Methods with
his Children; first, he avoided, on all Occasions,
entring into Disputes with his perverted Son, I mean
publick Disputes; but knowing very well, that Po∣pery
had rendred it self ridiculous for some Ages,
by entertaining the grossest Absurdities, and ranging
them among the <HI>Credenda,</HI> or Things to be believ'd;
and that the Priests had carried these Things on to
such inconsistent, preposterous Lengths, that them∣selves
could not defend them; he always took his
Son by this Handle, and furnishing himself from
History, of which he was a complete Master, with
the full Relations of some of the most astonishing
Enthusiasms, and surfeiting gross Pieces of Idolatry
and Popery, that he thought to his Purpose, his
Son could never propose any Thing in Discourse in
Favour of any Popish Principles, but the Father
would bring in some Story or other, from good Au∣thority,
which should expose, not only Popery i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
self in the gross, but should render the Practice of
those Principles absurd and ridiculous in particular.</P>
<P>For Example: One Day, his Son pretended, at
Table, to argue upon, and defend the Supreme Au∣thority
of the <HI>Pope</HI> and his Superiority, over the rest
of the Clergy, as universal Bishop: His Father
heard him out, and then, not directing his Speech
to his Son, but to his other Children; <HI>Pray,</HI> says
the Father, <HI>ask your Brother,</HI> how <HI>the Pope</HI> came
by this Superiority? and how long it was before the
Church acknowledged him for <HI>universal Bishop?</HI></P>
<P>The Son, too ignorant in History to deal with his
Father, told them it was always so; he derived it
from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and that he was acknowledged to be
such in all Ages: Upon this, the Father, smiling at
his Son's Folly, but turning to his eldest Daughter,
Come, <HI>my Dear,</HI> says he, I'll tell you how this bles∣sed
Thing, called the <HI>Pope,</HI> obtained the Title of
<HI>Universal Bishop.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="63"/>
In the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Mauritius,</HI> and
about 590 Years after Christ, <HI>Gregory,</HI> Sir∣named
the Great, being then Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> there
was one <HI>Phocas,</HI> a Soldier or Centurion in the Em∣peror's
Guards; a bold, bloody, and enterprizing
Fellow, but of no great Interest: This <HI>Phocas,</HI> find∣ing
Things went but very indifferently at Court, that
the Factions and Parties began to cabal one against
another, and that the Emperor's Interest declined
very much, thought he might set up a Party as well
as others; and filling his Head with aspiring Thoughts,
began to aim at the Empire.</P>
<P>In thinking of proper Instruments to assist him in
his treasonable Design, it came to his Mind, that
<HI>Gregory,</HI> the Bishop <HI>Rome,</HI> had a long Time
struggled for the Title of Universal Bishop; but was
always opposed by the Emperor <HI>Mauritius,</HI> in Fa∣vour
of <HI>John</HI> IV. Bishop of <HI>Constantinople:</HI> Upon this,
he proposes to himself a Scheme of double Villany;
namely, of Treason and Murther; and so to answer
both their Designs (<HI>viz.</HI>) that <HI>Phocas</HI> should mur∣ther
the Emperor <HI>Mauritius</HI> and his Son, who were
Enemies to both, and usurp the Throne Imperial:
That upon this Murther, <HI>Gregory</HI> should acknow∣ledge
<HI>Phocas</HI> to be Emperor, and <HI>Phocas,</HI> in return,
would acknowledge <HI>Gregory</HI> to be Universal Bishop:
And thus the Supremacy of the Pope, above the
rest of the Bishops, <HI>says the Father,</HI> was first design'd
by a double Conspiracy of Treason and Murther;
and if this be the great Original they have to boast
of, let them make their best of it.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>says the Father, Gregory</HI> did not live to
take up the Title, for he had written vehemently
against it; but <HI>Boniface</HI> the Third compleated the
Conspiracy, and enjoy'd the Title; and <HI>Gregory</HI> in
his Life Time congratulated the Murtherer. The
Son was horridly ashamed of this Story, and would
fain have suggested that it was not true; but his Fa∣ther
<PB N="50" REF="64"/>
offering undoubted Evidence from the most
authentick Writers of those Times, he had nothing
to say; and the Sister, to whom the Father directed
his Discourse, laugh'd heartily at it; which provok'd
her Brother so much, that he could hardly keep his
Temper with her, and the keen satyrical Girl,
made the more of a Jest about it.</P>
<P>This Method proving thus effectual, his Father
often took the same Course with him; and ever,
when he had the least Argument to bring about his
Popish Trumpery, his Father would confute him,
by telling one Story or other out of Antiquity to ex∣pose
it, which always brought his Brothers and Si∣sters
to ridicule him, and fail'd not effectually to put
an End to his Discourse.</P>
<P>This, in the End, deliver'd the Family from the
importuning young Casuist; tir'd him, and made
him sick of his Attempt to proselyte his Brother and
Sister; but the pious anxious Father, greatly concern'd
to see, that not only the Sophistry of the Priests
in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> had perverted and deluded his Son,
and so had robbed him of his eldest Comfort, but
that they had listed him a Missionary for the propaga∣ting
Popery in his Family, and had set him on work to
deceive the rest, apply'd himself very seriously to see
that none, under his Roof, should be infected with
the Contagion; and therefore, setting apart some
Time every Day for so good a Work, he entered
solemnly into all the Points of Protestant and Po∣pish
Doctrine with them, for their fuller Instruction.</P>
<P>In doing this, in occurr'd to him, that the only
Way to confirm his Children in the good Principles
he had begun to instill into them, would be to set
Popery in a true Light; to dress it up in its own
Cloaths, and shew them its Picture drawn to the
Life. That so the Delusions commonly attending
Popish Councils might no more prevail on them, and
they might see what a Monster it really was.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="65"/>
This Part of his Work necessarily running him
out into pleasant Historical Discourses, useful and
profitable to others, as well as to his Children, occa∣sioned
this Publication, and you will see something
of them in the following Dialogues.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Time after this first Broil with the Son,
which the Father, as I have said, turned off with
a Story; and after which, the Father took all Occa∣sions
to talk with his Children upon the same Subject:
It happened that the second Son, a young Gentle∣man
of about Eighteen Years of Age, who his Fa∣ther
had carefully instructed in sound Principles, fell
into a little Dispute with his eldest Sister, upon the
Subject of reading Romances.</P>
<P>The Father, who was not in the Room at the begin∣ning
of the Debate, came in and out occasionally seve∣ral
Times while it lasted; and at length, set himself
down to hear it out: they would have stopp'd their
Discourse upon that, but he told them he would
withdraw, rather than they should break it off, and
that he would be no more than a Hearer; for he
would not influence them in the least on one Side or
other; or speak a Word, unless, on any particular
Occasion, they ask'd his Opinion.</P>
<P>The Dispute began about the Reading or not
Reading Romances, or fictitious Stories: They were
both, as well Brother as Sister, against the Reading
them as a Diversion, there being no possible Plea∣sure
in reading a Story which we knew to be false,
but related as if it were a Truth: But the Sister
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
would have it to be, that it was not fit they should be
read at all; nay, that it was a Sin; and that, as the
making and writing them was criminal in itself, be∣ing,
as she explained it, what the Scripture meant by
<HI>making a Lye;</HI> so no pretended Use that might be
made of it, could justify the Action: And that, if
the writing or publishing a Romance, was a Lye;
so, of Consequence, the reading it, that is to say, the
reading it as a Diversion, or with Delight, must be
the same.</P>
<P>The Brother argued, That, as the End and Use
of every Fable was in the Moral; so a Fiction, or
what they call'd a Romance, told only with Design
to deceive the Reader, bring him to believe, that the
Fact related was true, and so to please and delight
him with a Falshood instead of a History, must be
what she had call'd it, criminal and wicked, and <HI>mak∣ing
a Lye;</HI> being done with a Design to deceive,
and was made still more so, by how much it was
more or less design'd to deceive prejudicially, and to
the Hurt of the Person, as particularly where it was
calculated to recommend Vice, discourage Virtue,
debauch the Ears and Minds of Youth, raise
loose and vain Conceptions of Things in the
Thoughts, and the like.</P>
<P>But on the contrary, where the Moral of the Tale
is duly annex'd, and the End directed right, wherein
it evidently accords; the enforcing sound Truths;
making just and solid Impressions on the Mind; re∣commending
great and good Actions, raising Senti∣ments
of Virtue in the Soul, and filling the Mind
with just Resentments against wicked Actions of all
Kinds: He insisted then, and in such Cases, Fables,
feigned Histories, invented Tales, and even such as
we call <HI>Romances,</HI> have always been allow'd as the
most pungent Way of writing or speaking; the most
apt to make Impressions upon the Mind, and open
the Door to the just Inferences and Improve∣ment
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
which was to be made of them. He added,
that for some Ages, it was the most usual, if not the
only Way of Teaching in the World; the brightest
Part of Oratory, and was used in Cases of the last
Moment, as the most Persuasive; that we find it fre∣quent
in Scripture, as in the Speech of the wise
Woman of <HI>Tekoah</HI> to King <HI>David, 2 Sam.</HI> xiv. 4,
5, 6, 7. the like of <HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet to the same
King <HI>David,</HI> on Occasion of the Murther of <HI>Uri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h,</HI>
and the debauching his Wife, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xii. from the first
to the fifth Verse: and again, the like in the Message
of <HI>Joash</HI> King of <HI>Israel</HI> to <HI>Amazia</HI> King of <HI>Judah,</HI>
2. <HI>Chron.</HI> xxv. 18. and several others. He went on
to the several Allusions made use of by the Prophets,
and that by the Direction of Heaven, as particularly
that of the Prophets <HI>Ezekiel, Isaiah, &amp;c.</HI> and
he at last instanc'd in the Parables or Historical
Relations, left upon Record by our Saviour himself;
such as that of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> that of the Prodi∣gal
Son, and especially of the Sower, who went forth
to sow, and sowed his Corn by the Highway Side;
and many others.</P>
<P>The Brother went a great Way farther in that
Part of his Discourse, but lest they should seem
too large in his Allowance of Romances in General;
he forget not, however, to make a kind of Proviso
at the End of his Discourse, against approving of
such Fables and Romances as are usually the Pro∣duct
of the present Age, having no such moral or
justifiable End attending them; and to recommend
to his Sister the bringing her Taste of Things to
such a Perfection, that she might be apt to judge
of Truth, and receive due Impressions of Wisdom
and Knowledge, tho' not dress'd up with far∣fetch'd
Allusions, Allegories, and invented Stories to
enforce them; and to this Purpose, he gave her the
just Characters of several fabulous Writings, which
were much in Vogue in the Town, and also of their
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
Writers: From which Discourse, they descended to
those of Operas, Plays, Tragedies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and they
had several Discourses afterwards upon the same Sub∣ject,
which would be very well worth recording; but
being foreign to the present Purpose, I lay them by
for another Occasion.</P>
<P>The good Father was exceedingly delighted with
the Discourse, and especially to hear his Son arguing in
so solid and serious a Manner; but he was surprized
with the sudden Turn of his Daughter's Wit on that
Occasion: Whether the young Lady thought her self
out-done by the solid Arguments her Brother made
use of; or that she rather yielded to, than differ'd from
his Opinion, but was perhaps loth to let him see it, I
know not; but she stopt the Discourse; and turning
to her Father, she says, Sir, you used to tell us some
old Stories about Popery, a hundred Times more to
the Purpose than this grave Discourse; Pray, Sir,
have you ever a Tale left to divert us that Way?</P>
<P>No, Daughter, <HI>says the Father,</HI> not so much more
profitable than this neither, for I like your Discourse
on both Sides very well; you see I did not interrupt
you.</P>
<P>But, says she, my Brother talks too grave for me;
I love a short close Answer, and then I have done
with it; I don't love making a short Question be a
Text for a long Sermon.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Sister is all Wit, and she expects one of
her nice Questions, should be answered as concisely
as she proposes it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother is all Sense, and he expects to
make me as wise as himself, and that is a Difficulty
out of his reach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Satyr upon your Brother's Sense,
at the same Time that you seem to commend it, for
where's the Sense of expecting it, if it is out of reach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, you have both of you too much Sense
to differ on such a Point as this; I like the Discourse
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>
on both Hands: My Daughter's Objection against
Romances, is good, only a little too general; and my
Son's Exceptions are just too, with a due Caution not to
encourage the corrupt Usage of the Age, in putting
Romances upon us without their Moral, and affirming
them not to be Romances: and this puts me in Mind
of a Story which may be necessary for your Instruc∣tion
on both Sides, and is not remote to the present
Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daught.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not doubt but my Father would
have a good Story for us, to serve for a Moral to
our <HI>romantick Discourses.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Story begins with a Question, and your
own Discourse introduces it: You have been speak∣ing
about Romances, and reading Romances, and you,
Daughter, in particular, have pass'd a kind of Sar∣casm
upon your own Discourses, and call'd them
<HI>Romantick;</HI> Pray what do you mean by a <HI>Romance,</HI>
and whence do you derive the Word <HI>Romantick?</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>They all sat silent a good while; at last, the
Daughter said, Brother, do you speak; and the Bro∣ther
said, No, Sister, do you speak, my Father di∣rects
his Question to you.</P>
<P>Nay, says the <HI>Sister,</HI> I must own, I can't tell, do
you speak, Brother.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a Dfficulty, <HI>says the Brother,</HI> in the
Question: It has Two different Parts in it; if I an∣swer
to the Word <HI>Romances</HI> only, I must say, we ge∣nerally
understand it to be a formal made Story in
Print, raised out of the Invention of the Author,
and put upon the World to cheat the Readers, in
the Shape or Appearance of Historical Truth; but
if I must explain my Sister's Term (<HI>viz.</HI>) of <HI>roman∣tick
Discourses,</HI> I cannot answer; I hope we have
been telling no Lyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I meant nothing, but that we were gotten
into a Strain of Discourse above our Understanding,
at least above mine; and I think, to talk of Things
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
above our Reach, with a Supposition that we were
sufficient to the Discourse, is to talk <HI>Romantick.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have both answered me to my Satisfaction;
for I am not going to cavil at Trifles, but to bring it to
my Purpose; and the next part of my Question is
this: I suppose these Accounts to be both right in
their Places respectively, but how came these fictitious
Stories to be called <HI>Romances?</HI> and those Discoursing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of what we do not understand, with the Vanity and
Pride of pretending to understand them, <HI>Romantick?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sir, you have a little pos'd me in
that; I must consider and inquire a litttle before I
answer: let my Sister give an Account of it, perhaps
she knows better than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no Matter for inquiring or jesting with
your Sister; I'll tell you whence it comes.</P>
</SP>
<P>When the <HI>Romish</HI> Priests, having set up a New
Pageantry of Worship in the Christian Church, and
which we, for divers good Causes and Considerations
call <HI>Popery;</HI> they found it very difficult to suppor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
all the gross Impositions, which they put upon Man∣kind
for want of <HI>Miracles.</HI></P>
<P>Real <HI>Miracle</HI> was out of their Power; the False∣hood
of their Faith plac'd all those Things beyond
their Reach; but the Cause must be upheld, <HI>fas
aut nefas;</HI> and real Miracle not being to be had,
imaginary Wonder was made use of to supply:
These being attested by the Priests in every Place, and
some very remote from <HI>Rome;</HI> it was no Wonder,
that they were swallowed greedily by the People in
those Days, when, by long Ignorance, their Minds
were prepar'd to be impos'd upon.</P>
<P>The Accounts of these suppos'd Miracles, swel∣ling
in Bulk, and growing too numerous to be re∣tain'd
in Memory, were first recorded by the Monks,
in their several Registers; and then brought to
<HI>Rome,</HI> to be registered also in the Books or Records
of the <HI>Vatican.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="71"/>
The Books where those lying Tales were set down,
were called <HI>Legenda,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>English, Le∣gends;</HI>
and because they were kept, as I said, at
<HI>Rome,</HI> from whence Copies were transmitted to all
Parts of the World, they were called <HI>Roman Legends.</HI></P>
<P>The most scandalous Falshoods, the most ridiculous,
simple, and impossible Things, being thus put upon
the World by the Priests; and the Belief of them im∣pos'd,
on Pain of <HI>Anathema</HI> and Excommunication;
the more enlightned World began at length to open
their Eyes; nor was it the least Step to the Reforma∣tion;
for even, long before <HI>Luther,</HI> the <HI>Lollards,</HI> the
<HI>Wickliffians,</HI> the <HI>Hussites,</HI> and others, who first saw
thro' those Fables, began to expose them to the
World; thus gradually they grew into Contempt,
till at length, they became a Thing of mere Scorn;
a <HI>Roman Legend</HI> was soon taken, in general, to
be a Collection of Lyes; and by Consequence, any
other false Stories put together to abuse the World,
were soon after esteemed a <HI>Roman Legend.</HI> Hence,
the learned Part of the World, abridging the Speech
with more Propriety, call'd speaking falsly, <HI>Roman∣cing,</HI>
and a bold Way of advancing Falshood by
mere dint of Face, was from thence called <HI>Roman∣tick;</HI>
if it was in Writing, it was called a <HI>Romantick
Style;</HI> if in Speech, a <HI>Romantick</HI> Discourse, and the
like.</P>
<P>Hence, I derive the Word Romance, (<HI>viz.</HI>) from
the Practice of the <HI>Romanists,</HI> in imposing Lyes and
Fables upon the World; and I believe, without inju∣ring
any one, I may venture to say, that Popery is a
<HI>Romantick Religion,</HI> and, if Opportunity offers, I
may convince you all of it, in a little Time.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I said, my Father would find something
upon the Subject that would both instruct us and
make us merry too; I never heard any Thing more
to the Purpose in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Thing is very probable, for I have
heard, indeed, that those Legends are a Bulk of
strange and most ridiculous Things, brought to∣gether
by the Priests, and collected from all the
Corners of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the farther off the better, because
as the People are bound to believe them, so, if
they would dispute them, they have no Oppor∣tunity
to unravel the Fraud; 'tis plac'd at so re∣mote
a Distance there is no searching into it: Such
as the miraculous Tomb of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in the
Kingdom of <HI>Golconda</HI> in the <HI>Indies;</HI> the Miracle
of St. <HI>Hilarion</HI> riding over the <HI>Nile</HI> upon a <HI>Cro∣codile,</HI>
and many such like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you will give us some particular
Stories of this Kind, at your Leisure; that we may
see a little farther into the Knavery of the Priests,
since they are so busy with us to bring us over: I wish
my Brother had heard this Story in particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall give you Evidence enough of the Impu∣dence
of their Legends, if that will be any Help to
you: But first let me lay the Foundation, and tell
you how, and by what Degrees, this <HI>Romish</HI> Anti∣christ
set her self up in Christ's Throne, and usurp'd
his Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would, Sir; for nothing can be so
sure a Foundation for us to go upon, as to know the
true History of Popery, and where she began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>She began indeed right; her Foundation is
built upon the Ruin of the true Christian Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is the more likely to be Idolatrous her∣self;
for the Corruption of the best Things is the
worst: Naturalists tell us, that nothing is more con∣tagious
than the Plague upon a human Body, which
in itself is the most beautiful of all God's Creatures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know the Thing is tedious in itself,
but my Father can sum up the History of it in a few
Words, if he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A few Words will not indeed describe it; the
History of a Thousand Years is not easily abridg'd,
or brought into the Compass of a Story of Ten Mi∣nutes,
and now would be too long for your hearing;
but you may take it piece-meal, and I'll give it you
some and some, as I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother, Sir, insists much upon it, that
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was at first the true Christian
Church, and the only true Church, and that we ac∣knowledge
it to be so; that it was the same that suf∣fer'd
all those Severities under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors,
which we call the Ten Persecutions, and that they
only were the true Primitive Christians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he adds, that all the glorious Martyrs,
who we call the Fathers, such as St. <HI>Polycarpe,</HI> St.
<HI>Ignatius,</HI> St. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and an innu∣merable
Company of Martyrs, were Members of
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and that several of their <HI>Popes</HI>
were Martyrs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Son, you run too fast; you should say
Bishops of <HI>Rome,</HI> not <HI>Popes,</HI> for they were not come
to be <HI>Popes,</HI> in the Sense we now understand the
Word, for several hundred Years after the Ten Per∣secutions
were over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother call'd them <HI>Popes,</HI> Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and so all the Bishops of other Churches
were call'd <HI>Popes,</HI> till after a long Series of Trea∣son,
Conspiracy, and even War and Blood, the
Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> assum'd Temporal Power, and at
last the Primacy; of which I told you the Story,
when your Brother was here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish, Sir, you would tell us that Story over
again; it confounded our new Convert so, that he
had not a Word to say; and I am persuaded, it would
make any Body that was to hear it, sick of Popery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it seems you remember it, Child; there's
no need to repeat it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, but I ha'n't all the Particulars, I would
be so Mistress of the whole Story, as to be able to
tell it again in Company; for sometimes we meet
with a Papist or two, and they are generally pretty
talkative, especially the Ladies; and it would be a
rare Story to tell them, when they are in their
Altitudes, crying up the <HI>Pope,</HI> and his infallible
Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you should have more of the Story,
Child, than I had Time to tell to your Brother. I
assure you it is worth your hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you said that the Bishops of other
Churches were call'd <HI>Popes</HI> too; I do not remember
that ever I heard that before: I thought there had
never been any <HI>Popes</HI> but the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, the Word Pope was originally no
more than <HI>Papa,</HI> or Father, and to this Day, in fo∣reign
Countries, all the Priests are called <HI>Padres,</HI> that
is to say, Fathers; and as we in <HI>England</HI> call our
Bishops Right Reverend Fathers, and the Arch∣bishops
the Most Reverend Fathers, so in those Days
the Christian Bishops were call'd Fathers, that is
Papa's, or Popes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I suppose they did not use the very
same Word Pope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes they did, the very same Word, as may
be seen in History. <HI>Cornelius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> in
his Writings to his Brethren the Bishops of <HI>Asia,</HI>
speaking of St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> calls him <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Carthage;
Dionysius,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> Successor of <HI>Atha∣nasius,</HI>
calls his Predecessor <HI>Heraclias,</HI> the Blessed
<HI>Pope Heraclias;</HI> and <HI>Sidonius,</HI> a famous Christian
Father, in all his Epistles to <HI>Hilary,</HI> and other his
Contemporaries, calls all the Bishops of <HI>France, Popes;</HI>
and the Emperor <HI>Constantine,</HI> writing to St. <HI>Athanasius,</HI>
calls him, <HI>Your Holiness:</HI> So that the Stile is not at
all a Peculiar to the Bishop of <HI>Rome;</HI> the Bishop of
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and of several other
Capital Cities, were call'd <HI>Popes,</HI> as far back as to
<HI>Constantine</HI> himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is more indeed than I had consider'd
before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it seems we call our Bishops <HI>Popes</HI> here
in <HI>England;</HI> I never minded that before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would be very angry if you should call
them so, for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if you please, Sir, let us go back a little
to those Times, and let us hear how long the
Church of <HI>Rome</HI> continu'd Christian; it seems she
was the Primitive and Only Christian true Church
at first; that, you say, we must grant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis granted; and they boast much of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they do; my Brother made a great
Bluster about it; and, in particular, that the Pro∣testants
acknowledg'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have very little to boast of upon that
Account; let 'em look into the <HI>Lam.</HI> v. 16. The
<HI>Jewish</HI> Church was God's pure Church many Hun∣dred
Years: But what says the Prophet; <HI>The Crown
is fallen from Our Heads;</HI> WOE <HI>unto us that We have
sinned!</HI> They were once a flourishing Church, <HI>that
is true;</HI> but the Crown is fallen from their Heads:
The Reason is plain; they fell from their Primitive
Purity, which was their Glory, and being gradually
subjected to the Tyranny of the Clergy; they (the
Clergy) drew them from that Purity of Doctrine, to
all those gross Absurdities and Errors, till they re∣duc'd
their Primitive Purity of Principles into one
great Mass, or Bulk of Idolatry and Superstition,
such as we find it to be at this Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this was not all at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Child; as the Church was several
Hundred Years growing under the Tyranny of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, so it was some Ages flourishing
in Liberty and Prosperity, under the Dominion and
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
Protection of Christian Emperors; and it was from
thence several Hundred Years in its declining State;
till it might be said to be arriv'd to the Full Per∣fection
of its Decay, and to be the mere <HI>Seat of the
Beast,</HI> as describ'd in the Scripture, and as we see it
this Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, when do you reckon the Primi∣tive
Church to be in its Heighth of Purity and Prospe∣rity?
For certainly it was once in a most glorious State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, that is a difficult Thing to point out to
you; for no sooner did the Church get Liberty and
Ease, and the Enemies of Religion cease to perse∣cute,
but Pride and Strife broke in upon its Peace
by the haughty Behaviour of the Clergy: Prosperity
puff'd them up: The Emperor <HI>Constantine,</HI> in his
abundant Zeal for Religion, gave the Priests such an
excessive Sway in the Empire, that they knew not
how to moderate themselves: In short, he forgot
that, tho' the Bishops were Christians, and good
Christians too, yet that they were Men also, and
subject to like Passions as other Men; and, in a
Word, he gave them such a Head, and such a Loose
to their Pride (as Priests) and set them up so high,
that all the Kings of the Earth have not been able to
bring them down again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was an ill Use made of the good Inten∣tions
of a pious Prince; for in all the Histories that
I have read of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, they represent
him as a wonderful Prince for his Zeal, and sincere Af∣fection
to the Christian Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they do him but Right, for it was his
Due: But I say too, it was the weakest Part of
that Prince. He ador'd the Clergy; he set them up
as little Idols in the Government of the Church;
who the People were not only to obey, but to re∣verence,
and almost to worship; and, at the same
Time, he forgot that they were Men, till they put
him in Mind of it by their Folly and Pride; for they
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
were continually falling out and wrangling with one
another, and that chiefly for Superiority, and the
highest Places in the Synagogue; and this not only
perplex'd the Emperor, and was very grievous to
him, in the latter End of his Days, but it raised
Sects and Divisions in the Church, and Factions, and
even Tumults in the State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was very early to begin in that Manner,
when they were but just got, as it were, out of the
Fire of Persecution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so; but that was not all: For it not
only brought in Divisions and Factions, but with
those came in Errors and Heresies of divers Sorts;
such as were afterwards fatal to the Church's Peace,
and scandalous to the very Name of Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, the Church had but a very short
Space of Prosperity; for <HI>Constantine</HI> himself, I think,
did not reign above Two and thirty Years, and a
long Reign too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis true, her Prosperity was short, if you
reckon only the Time when her Tranquillity was un∣disturb'd,
and her Profession uncorrupted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think she could not be said to be in a State
of Prosperity, when she enjoy'd neither Purity in
Doctrine, or Peace in Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true; and that was indeed her Case,
in the breaking out of the <HI>Arian</HI> Heresy, which
shew'd itself even in the Reign of <HI>Constantine</HI> himself,
the first Christian Emperor; and grew to such a
Heighth, and with such a swift and speedy Advance,
that the next Emperor, <HI>Constantius,</HI> was a profess'd
<HI>Arian,</HI> and an Encourager of all those that had
disturb'd the Church before; the Consequence of
which was, that the Orthodox Professors were depo∣sed,
and Persecution broke out again in a lamentable
Manner: For the Christians persecuted one another
alternatively; the <HI>Arians</HI> the Orthodox, and the
Orthodox the <HI>Arians,</HI> as Power came into their
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
Hands, with almost as much Vehemence and Cruelty,
as the Heathens had before used them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Confirmation of what I have often
observ'd, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That Liberty has not always been
an Advantage to the Christian Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from it, that, on the contrary, it seems
as if God had thought fit to cause the Afflictions of
his Church to be the best Means of its Establishment;
but that's a Speculation too tedious for our brief Way
of Talking, and would require a Recapitulation of
the History of the Church in all Ages, as well the
<HI>Jewish</HI> as the Christian; for even from the Begin∣ning
of an establish'd Worship, the Professors always
fell back from their Profession in the Times of Liber∣ty
and Toleration; and return'd to humble them∣selves,
when under the Oppression of their Enemies,
in Captivity, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Reason can be assign'd for it? We
know it is so, and even to this Day 'tis evident
among the reform'd Churches thro' all <HI>Europe;</HI> but
'tis very strange that it should be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's likewise too long, and too melancholy
a Subject for our Way of Talking; it would be an
excellent Discourse for a Fast-Day Sermon; for 'tis a
suitable Subject of Humiliation to us, and all Pro∣testants:
But your Father is no Minister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think my Father is a very good Minister
to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>While you think so, Child, I may hope for
the more Success; but I desire to keep within the
Bounds of my Place: I may instruct as a Father,
tho' not preach as a Minister, and so far I am a Mi∣nister
in my Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, Sir, go on with the State of the
Church, where you left off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the Disturbance that <HI>Arius</HI> gave the
Church did not last long; <HI>Constantius</HI>'s Reign was
short; and <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, threatning the whole
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
Fabrick of the Church with a Dissolution, and the
Restoration of Paganism, the Christians began to be
a little better united; and his Reign being short, the
Orthodox Part recover'd; and tho' the Errors of
<HI>Arius</HI> continu'd, yet the Government was Orthodox,
and so the Church might be said to enjoy Peace and
Liberty for a long Time.</P>
</SP>
<P>But in this Time of Liberty, the Brigues and In∣trigues
of the Clergy ruin'd all another Way; for
they were continually quarrelling for Trifles, such as
the Observation of <HI>Easter,</HI> the Manner of receiving
Penitents, and the like; but above all, the great
Affair of the Primacy, and who should be upper∣most;
and this agitated the Church till the Year
590, and so I am come down to the Story of Pope
<HI>Gregory</HI> and the Emperor <HI>Phocas,</HI> where I left off with
your Brother.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's the Story that I want to hear over
again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why 'tis a Story worth hearing, especially
for young Popish Converts, or such as are in Dan∣ger
of being perverted by the Craft of the Priests.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> the Great was Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> at the
same Time that <HI>Mauritius</HI> was Emperor of <HI>Constanti∣nople;</HI>
it's plain that a Contest had been car∣ried
on for several Years between the Bishops of
<HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> for the Title of <HI>Universal</HI>
Bishop: But that <HI>Constantinople</HI> being the Capital of
the Empire, and where the Emperor kept his Re∣sidence,
the Bishop of that City had a great Ad∣vantage,
and, by rhe Favour of the Court, main∣tain'd
his Primacy with Ease; so that the Bishops
of <HI>Rome</HI> could not come in for several Years.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory,</HI> tho' willing enough to have been the
Head of the Church, yet finding it out of his
Reach, play'd a new Game; for, like the Fox,
because he could not come at the Grapes, he despis'd
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
'em, and said they were sour and unwholsome; so he
not being able to obtain the Title of Universal Bishop
for himself, anathematiz'd all those that pretended to
it; declaring it to be a most impious Thing, unbe∣coming
a Christian Bishop, a Scandal to the Name
and Profession of the Christian Religion, and the
like; and this he push'd on to such a Height, that
there are several publick Acts of his now ex∣tant,
which are full of the warmest Expressions of
Zeal against those that sought this Superiority; some
of which I'll give you in Writing, that you may be
sure to remember them on all Occasions; for this
<HI>Gregory</HI> was a famous Man in the Church, and was
for many Reasons stil'd the <HI>Great.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not that he, who, they say, was the last of
the good Bishops, and the first of the bad ones?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the same; only, that 'tis a little differing∣ly
exprest, for they said rather, that he was the worst
of the Good Bishops, and far from being the best
of the Bad ones: But you shall have his Character
best laid before you, in the History of his Conduct
in this particular Affair: The Story is pretty long,
but 'tis fit you should hear it.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>John</HI> IV. was Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and he
being Bishop of the Imperial City, and having a par∣ticular
Interest in, and Influence upon the Emperor,
began the Emulation, by insisting, That the Imperi∣al
City, as it had the chief Civil Magistrate on Earth,
so it ought to have the chief Spiritual Officer, resi∣ding
in it, for the Good, and for the Service of the
Church. Upon this Insinuation, to which he obtain∣ed
the Emperor's Assent, he assumed the Title of
OECUMENICAL, that is to say, UNIVERSAL BISHOP.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> opposed this Usurpation,
as he call'd it, with all his Might; but that Em∣peror
openly taking <HI>John</HI> IV's. Party, and as 'tis
suggested, having a private Resolution to humble
<PB N="67" REF="81"/>
<HI>Gregory</HI> upon some former Misunderstanding be∣tween
them; <HI>Gregory</HI> soon found it was in vain for
him to struggle with <HI>John,</HI> in Behalf of his own See
of <HI>Rome,</HI> for the Emperor had sent him a peremp∣tory
Command, to submit to POPE <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI>
and give him the Title of <HI>OEcumenical:</HI>
I say, finding himself thus over-match'd, and that he
could not expect the Honour of being call'd Univer∣sal,
he falls upon the Title itself, and condemns it as an
Usurpation; affirming, that no Christian Bishop
ought to presume to take such a Title upon him.</P>
<P>This is to be seen in several of <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Epistles,
which are still extant: Some of his Expressions of
this kind have been faithfully collected and translated
from the Fourth Book of <HI>Pope Gregory</HI>'s<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See for this St. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Epistle to the Emperor, in F. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Hist. of tte Council of <HI>Trent.</HI> Fol. 773.</NOTE>
Epistles.</P>
<P>Upon this Discourse, the Father gave his Daughter
a Copy of the Quotations in Writing, for the
Help of her Memory; and then went on with
his Observations, thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus you see, what a blessed Original the
Establishment of Popery has to boast of, and from
what Springs of Blood, Treason, and Usurpation,
all the Streams which have hitherto watered the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church, have flow'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sad Beginning, indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we have heard Abundance of fine Things
said of this Pope <HI>Gregory,</HI> and he is cried up very
much by some, as an Extraordinary Man; nay, as
a Good, as well as Great Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, there is a great deal to be said of
him indeed, and he would never have obtained the
Name of <HI>Gregory the Great,</HI> if there were not; but
let us see of what Kind it is.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="68" REF="82"/>
He was the Father of Superstition, and that in
such a notorious Degree, that he is said to be the
Contriver of several of the most gross and fatal Er∣rors
of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, and the Introducer of
them into Practice: For Example; Father <HI>Plautina</HI>
tells us,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The whole Office, or Ecclesiastical <HI>Formula,</HI>
which is now called the MASS, was of his
Forming, and his mere Invention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He first introduc'd the Celibacy of the Clergy,
forbidding the Deacons of <HI>Sicily</HI> to have any
Wives; a plain Doctrine of <HI>D.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He set up the <HI>Invocation</HI> of <HI>Saints.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He set up the <HI>Dedication</HI> of <HI>Churches,</HI> to the
Names and Memory of departed Saints and to
Angels.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. He was the most zealous Monk-maker that
ever sat in the Episcopal Chair of the Diocese of
<HI>Rome,</HI> and oppos'd the Emperor <HI>Mauritius,</HI>
when he forbid the Soldiers deserting the Army
to turn Monks, in Times of War; a most rea∣sonable
Negative!</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. He first assum'd the Title of <HI>Servus
Servorum,</HI>
us'd by the Popes to this Day.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These are some of the Things for which he ob∣tained
the Name of <HI>Great:</HI> As to the Title of <HI>Uni∣versal
Bishop,</HI> it is true, he did not live to receive
the <HI>Diploma</HI> from the Emperor <HI>Phocas;</HI> but there is
a most visible Testimony, how much he was of a
Turn-coat, and a Time-server in his particular Con∣duct
and Behaviour to those Emperors, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
<HI>Maurice</HI> and <HI>Phocas.</HI></P>
<P>While the Emperor <HI>Maurice</HI> or <HI>Mauritius</HI> was in
the Throne, tho' he hated him for taking Part with
<HI>John</HI> IV. Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as I have said,
yet see how the flattering Bishop writes to him in
<PB N="69" REF="83"/>
the most servile and subjected Manner. See Two of
his Letters to the Emperor for an Example.</P>
<P>“<HI>He is Responsible for it,</HI> says the Bishop in his
first Letter, <HI>before Almighty</HI> GOD, <HI>whosoever he be,</HI>
that shall either, in Word or Deed, <HI>be found guilty
against his Gracious Lord; and so were</HI> I, your most
unworthy Servant, <HI>if in this Case, &amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>Again, in another Letter; “<HI>When I presume to
speak</HI> unto my Lord, <HI>what am I but Dust,</HI> and a
very Worm of the Earth? <HI>Power is given unto</HI> my
Lord, <HI>over all Men;</HI> and Christ <HI>shall one Day
speak unto you, saying,</HI> To thee have I committed
<HI>my</HI> Priests <HI>and</HI> Bishops,” <HI>to be governed in my Fear.</HI>
Who can think this was written by a Pope, while the
Popes have since lorded it over so many Emperors?</P>
<P>A little while after this, <HI>Phocas,</HI> of whom I have
told you something, butchered this good and religious
Emperor, and his Wife and Children, in a most
cruel and barbarous Manner, usurping the Imperial
Throne: But <HI>John</HI> IV. Bishop of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> ho∣nestly
oppos'd <HI>Phocas,</HI> and detesting the Murtherer of
his Lord and Master, suffer'd under the same Tyranny.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> chopt in, taking the Advantage of his Op∣posite
being suppress'd, and writes his Compliment
to the Murtherer, in the most fulsome and ridicu∣lous
Flattery, as follows. You may read it in his
36th Epistle; for all his worthy Epistles are collected
together.</P>
<P>He begins his Epistle prophanely in the very first
Words, being the Song of the Angels, at the Nati∣vity
of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>GLORY BE TO GOD ON HIGH! says he,</HI>
who changeth the Times, and translateth Kingdoms;
who sometimes in his Justice, sendeth Princes to af∣flict
his People; <HI>and at other Times,</HI> in his Mercy,
those which again shall cherish them; <HI>for which
Cause,</HI> we rejoice that <HI>YOU</HI> are brought, <HI>BY GOD,</HI>
unto the Empire: Let the <HI>HEAVENS</HI> send forth Ac∣clamations,
<PB N="70" REF="84"/>
<HI>the Earth</HI> leap for Joy; <HI>and</HI> let all
the People be glad thereof.”</P>
<P>To <HI>Leontia</HI> the Empress, Wife to the bloody
Tyrant, he writes thus: “<HI>What Tongue can speak,
what Heart conceive, the Thanks which we owe to</HI>
GOD, <HI>for the Felicity of your Reign? Let</HI> the An∣gels
<HI>give Glory to</HI> GOD the Creator, in HEAVEN
<HI>above; and let all Mankind offer their Thanks on
Earth beneath,</HI> &amp;c.” and closes all with begging
their Protection of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and to be
mindful of TU ES PETRUS; promising, in Return,
that <HI>Peter</HI> should not be unmindful of them.</P>
<P>Here's, the Picture of a Christian Bishop, a Ser∣vant
of Servants; who at the same Time that he
protested against it in lofty Terms, and assumed that
humble Stile, was forming a Conspiracy, in secret
Design, to confirm to himself, the haughty Title of
<HI>Universal Bishop;</HI> and not only his Successor obtain'd
it, but all his Successors have since usurp'd it to this
Day.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to make of such a Man as
this; and yet I observe, Sir, all Writers cry him up
for a very pious good Man; and, I think, the <HI>Roman
Church</HI> have Sainted him many Ages ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must take the Character of the Man, and
of the Times, and put them together: He was a
mighty good Man, as Goodness went in those Days;
and, particularly, he was a mighty Stickler for Ce∣remony
and Superstition: In short, he laid the Foun∣dation
on which almost all the Errors and Delusions
of Popery have been built.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have enough of him; I think Popery ne∣ver
began to be true Popery till his Time: I suppose
the Successors went on as <HI>Gregory</HI> began.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>Boniface</HI> III. finished the Conspi∣racy;
for he being chosen Pope while he was at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> so far insinuated himself into the Ty∣rant
and Murtherer, who then reign'd as Emperor,
<PB N="71" REF="85"/>
I mean <HI>Phocas,</HI> that he declared the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI>
to be <HI>Oecumenical</HI> or <HI>Universal Bishop,</HI> whose Suc∣cessors
have kept the Title ever since, notwithstand∣ing
all the Declarations which <HI>Gregory</HI> made against
it: And thus you are come to the first Usurpations
of Popery. It is a long and a dismal Story, if con∣sider'd
in the fatal Consequences of it: But at first,
the Mischief was not perceiv'd; at least, not so
much as it has been since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray Sir, where lay the <HI>Snake in the
Grass</HI> all this while? What was the mighty Conse∣quence
of this Title of <HI>Universal?</HI> And what was it
to the World who enjoy'd it, whether the Bishop of
<HI>Rome</HI> or of <HI>Constantinople?</HI> I don't see much in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! you are mistaken, Child; as they boast
that Christ said to <HI>Peter,</HI> Upon <HI>this Rock</HI> will I
build my Church, meaning <HI>Peter</HI> personally; so up∣on
this Rock of Offence, all manner of Error, all
the abominable Cheats and horrid Idolatries of the
Papists, have been introduced into the <HI>Roman</HI> Church
to this Day: Such as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Bishop of Rome</HI> being declared <HI>Universal,</HI>
became thereby superior to all the Bishops;
and the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> to all the Churches in
the World; and this brought the Ecclesiastick
Legislature necessarily into their Hands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Hence,</HI> all the other Bishop Successors to <HI>Bo∣niface</HI>
III. assum'd the Right of Introducing
Rites and Modes of Worship into the Church,
and Imposing those Modes of Worship upon
the People; thence began Innovations, and
teaching, for Doctrine, the Commandments of
Men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Hence</HI> they brought in the great Cheat of In∣fallibility;
and that made them absolute Ty∣rants
over the Consciences of the People: For,
if the <HI>Pope</HI> was Head, or <HI>Universal,</HI>
and also
<PB N="72" REF="86"/>
<HI>Infallible,</HI> it was natural that all Men ought to
submit to him, upon Pain of Eternal Dam∣nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Upon this Doctrine of Submission to the Pope,
the whole Christian World became Slaves to the
<HI>Roman Pontiff;</HI> and they (the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI>)
rul'd it, indeed, with a Curb-Bridle: For,
they planted Churches, establish'd Bishops, call'd
Councils, and dissolv'd them at Pleasure; and,
in a Word, they truly, and literally, trod upon
the Necks of Princes; Deposing, Anathemati∣zing,
and even Murthering them, at Pleasure;
of which our own Histories, and the Histories
of Neighbouring Nations, are full of terrible
Examples.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see a little farther into it, indeed, than I
did before; 'Tis plain, that setting up as Heads,
would give them a Liberty of Tyrannizing at Plea∣sure;
and I shall never doubt but that when the
Churchmen have Power in their Hands, they al∣ways
find means to make the most of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>From this Time Monkery was farther encou∣rag'd;
it was set on foot in the Church but a little
before: And, what a Nest of Villainy was built up∣on
it afterwards, for the propagating of Enthusiasm,
and the most horrid Delusions, I shall take an Occa∣sion
to bring to your Remembrance as we go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think, Sir, we should trouble you
to look back thro' all the Particulars of a Popish
Legend of Lyes; and that you should be bound to
give us the Detail of all the Attacks which those
Wretches have made upon the Minds of the igno∣rant
People: The General History of these things
will lead us to inquire into the Particulars. That I
most wonder at, is, that such a Man as St. <HI>Gregory</HI>
should be drawn into such a Snare, as that of Setting
up the Idol of the Mass and other Trumpery; for
<PB N="73" REF="87"/>
he seems to be the Father of Superstition in the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis not to be wonder'd at at all, if you con∣sider
the great Advantages which Churchmen made
on those Occasions, to exalt their Power, encrease
their Gains, and give them an Influence in the
Councils of all the Courts in the World.</P>
</SP>
<P>This was not to be resisted by the Clergy, however
they might pretend to Sanctity and Self-denial: By
<HI>Gregory</HI>'s Example, almost every Pope, added some∣thing
New to the Lump and Formality of the Chri∣stian
Worship. SABINIANUS, the worthless Succes∣sor
for of <HI>Gregory the Great,</HI> began immediately, and
brought in the Use of Canonical Hours, which he
instituted in Distinction from other Times, accord∣ing
to the Custom among the <HI>Jews,</HI> of <HI>the Hour of
Prayer:</HI> He also ordained, that Tapers should be
kept continually burning upon the Altar; and yet
this Creature, of whom <HI>Plautina</HI> says, he merited
not to be remembered, held the Pontificate but
Seventeen Months and Nine Days: Had he liv'd
longer, he would have done all the Work himself.</P>
<P>His next Successor, <HI>Boniface</HI> III. held it but Eight
Months and some odd Days; and yet, he established
the Title of <HI>Universal Bishop</HI> upon the Chair of St.
<HI>Peter,</HI> by the Favour of the Tyrant and Murtherer
<HI>Phocas,</HI> as I have told you; and which they retain
to this Day: Thus every <HI>Pope,</HI> from this Time for∣ward,
imposed some Innovation or other upon the
Church, to exalt the outward Pomp and Power of
their Worship; till at length, it came up to the
Prodigy of Blasphemy and Idolatry, which we now
call <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boniface</HI> V. ordained the Church to be a Sanctu∣ary;
and that even Criminals, of the worst Kind,
such as for Murther, or Treason, or any Thing but
Sacrilege, if they fled to the Church, should not
be taken from thence by Force; an Immunity which
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church never parted with to this Day.
It was in his Time that <HI>Mahomet</HI> began to broach
his Imposture in the World; so that, in short, Po∣pery
and Mahometism, are not much differing in
their Age, being almost contemporary; only that Po∣pery
is the elder Error.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could they propose, Sir, to themselves
by those Innovations? There was nothing of Religion
in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The End they aimed at, is veiy plain; first it
tended to place a particular Dignity upon the Persons
of the Priests, to give a Superiority to them in all
Things; that so the Church might be exalted up to
Heaven, that the Mitre might be set above the
Crown, and the Popes, reign over all the Kings of
the Earth: In a Word, they aimed at Power; and
to give Sanction to their Authority, equal to what
the <HI>High Priest</HI> had in the old Levitical Institution,
who turned the King out of the Temple. (2.) And
in Order to this, it was needful to reassume as much
of the splendid Part of Religion as possible, that the
Pomp and Ceremony might command the Reverence
of the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they could not bring it to pass, I sup∣pose,
Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are greatly mistaken in that too, for they
did bring it to pass: Did they not obtain their End,
when, <HI>as you may see in History,</HI> Kings laid their
Crowns at their Feet? and the Popes brought
Princes and Kings, nay, Emperors, to kiss their
Toes, to kneel at their Foot-stools, to receive their
Crowns at their Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, indeed, they did so afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They could never have been brought to those
mean and abject Things, if the Popes had not first
brought into Usage abundance of those pompous,
ostentatious, insolent Things in the Church; Such
as,
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Ecclesiastical Immunities, I last mentioned,
by which they took upon them to protect Re∣bels,
Traytors, Murtherers; so that Kings
could not sit easy upon their Thrones, could
not do themselves Justice upon the worst Cri∣minals,
nor enjoy their just Authority in Safety,
for fear of the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Power of discharging Subjects from their
Allegiance to their lawful Sovereigns; dispensing
with Oaths, and the most sacred Obligations;
so setting up against their Matters, and forming
Rebellion, in the Name of GOD, who ap∣pointed
Obedience and Submission.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Forgiving Sins, and even giving Licence to
commit Things, which God had positively for∣bidden.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Setting up other Mediators, in Heaven, be∣sides
<HI>the One Mediator between God and Man;</HI>
who the Scripture declares to be <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Deposing Princes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Praying to, and worshipping Images, and the
rotten Reliques of dead Saints.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Feigned and fictitious Miracles, wrought not
only by the living Priests and Clergy, but even
by the Bones, or Images, or Pictures of the
dead Saints; and some of those Saints such,
whose History gives Room to believe, without
any Breach of Charity, that they are so far
from interceding for us in Heaven, that they
themselves never were there, and never will be
there: And abundance more, which I could
sum up to you, by which they exalted the
Power of the Mitre above the Sword; nay,
above the Crowns of the greatest Kings;
which, they could never have done, if they
had not gradually introduced these pompous
Things into the Church, and one, by one,
brought them to be submitted to by the People.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be too tedious for you, Sir, to
give us the long Detail of all the Errors embraced
by the <HI>Roman</HI> Church, and by what Degrees they
came into it; 'tis enough, now we see the Reason
and Design of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had rather my Father would let us into
something of the Errors themselves, be they intro∣duced
how, and by who they will.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You love a merry Story, Child; but how
shall we bring them in, to suit with such a serious
Subject?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard you say, Sir, that you durst
undertake, to expose the Absurdities of Popery,
to such a Degree, that any Thing but a meer Bigot,
would be laugh'd out of it, and might be made
asham'd of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am, indeed of the same Opinion still; and
believe it is the best Way to deal with a Papist, if he
is a Man of any Sense; for there are such ridicu∣lous
Things practised among them, and so many of
them, that a Man, who is at all guided by his
Reason, must blush to hear them. So that, indeed,
we want nothing but to set out Popery in its
proper Dress, give the World a Sight of it
in a clear Light, and in its true Colours; and if
this be done, as it ought to be, Popery would
certainly be hiss'd out of the World.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P>SOME Time after these first Dialogues, and du∣ring
the Time that the elder Brother, being un∣der
their Father's Displeasure, liv'd in Lodgings by
himself, as has been observed, as the second Brother,
and eldest Sister were visiting at the House of one
of their Relations, their elder Brother came in.</P>
<P>The young Lady was under some Surprize, when
she saw him come, and especially when she saw him
come with another Man in his Company; which, as
she said afterwards, she immediately concluded, was
one of the same Stamp; and she immediately said
<HI>to her Aunt,</HI> at whose House she was, I am very sor∣ry
to see my Brother come in; I see we shall have a
Battle.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, <HI>says her Aunt,</HI> don't be afraid,
he shall do you no harm, you shall have no Engage∣ment

shall keep the Peace among you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, says she, I don't think he will
quarrel with his own Brother, but I am afraid of his
Tongue; he has a subtle cunning Way with him.</P>

<P>No matter for that, <HI>says her Aunt,</HI> you
have a good Cause, don't be afraid.</P>

<P>Never fear, Sister, I warrant you, we will
defend our selves.</P>

<P>But, do you know, Brother, who that is
with him? I warrant you it is a Priest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know him, but I have seen them of∣ten

pleasant Countenance, and-looks like a good Sort of
a Man enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I warrant you he is a Priest; they often put
on an Air of Gravity and Good-humour, the better

<P>Let him be what he will, Sister, be not con∣cern'd;

Religion by any Body, be he Clergyman, or Lay∣man,
or if he were the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am not afraid to be frightned out of
my Religion, I am more afraid of being wheedled;
a good Cause ill defended, exposes the Cause it
self, and gives the Enemy Cause to boast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They shall have no Room, I hope, to boast
over us; but if you think 'tis a Priest, we will de∣cline
any Disputes with them at all; I think that's
the best Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had rather you would indeed, Brother, for
they are an Over-match for us; and if we do stand
our Ground, so far as may be to our own Satisfaction,
yet, the Priest by his pretended Victory, will tri∣umph
over us, in his Arguments to my Brother,
and so confirm him the farther in his Error.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, you think, if we receive no Hurt
our selves, we may do our Brother Hurt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am afraid of that, for he is a poor de∣luded
Creature, and our Weakness may confirm his
Delusions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, don't trouble your self about that,
he is bigotted enough already; he is so far gone,
there's no fetching him back, and you can't make
him worse than he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid of being an Instrument to con∣firm
his Popery, by my weak defending my own
Principles: <HI>Dear Aunt,</HI> I am but young in those
Things, I am not able to dispute; I know my Pro∣fession
<PB N="79" REF="93"/>
is sound, but, it may be, I cannot answer all
their Cavils.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then say nothing, Sister, only laugh at
them; I warrant you, we will conquer them by one
Way or other.</P>
<P>This short Discourse was among themselves, while
the Gentleman was receiving their Brother, and be∣fore
he was come into the Room; but as he, and the
Gentleman that came with him, came forward to
pay their Civilities, they were obliged to break it off,
and fall into other Discourses.</P>
<P>After some Time, and, I think, a Dinner between,
the young Gentleman begins with his Sister in jest:
Well, Sister, says he, I hope you will allow me
to come and take my Leave of you, before I go to

I hope you will bid me <HI>Adien.</HI></P>

<P>Kind! do you call it, to forbid me his
House!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know the Reason, Brother; his Affection
to all the rest of his Children oblig'd him, particu∣larly,
because you would not refrain your daily In∣sinuations,
in Favour of your Popish Stuff, and
would be continually endeavouring to wheedle us, and

himself; he owned it to be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>The like Zeal for Truth, and the same, tho'

<P>Nay, Brother, that re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lects upon my Fa∣ther:
Whatever has pass'd between my Father and
you, or whatever we have been instructed to think
of the Principles of your Religion, we were never
taught to treat you with Disrespect; nor did any of

<P>No, I don't admit that, because I know I
am right; and I cannot bear to hear the <HI>Catholick

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, whenever you debate with any

cutting of Throats; for they will claim the same

<P>Sir, if all the Histories that I have read, or

</SP>
<SP>

<P>O, Sir, she has read nothing of that; she

to instruct them all, by Way of Quotation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Leave reproaching our Father; I say, I

us by sound, and well-digested Reasonings,

But let that alone; my Father is not here: If he was,
he would be too hard for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What with a Parcel of Stories, from your In∣solent
Writers, who have answered the solid Argu∣ments
of Religion by Buffoonry, and turning the
Catholick Doctrine into Banter and Jest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was such Banter and Jest, as you
could make no Reply to; but did then, as you do
now, fly into a Passion: Why, yours must be a
strange Religion, that it will not bear cool Reason∣ing;
but that, when you are pinch'd a little, you
must fly out into Excesse, and lose your Temper;
you see, the sharp Repartee of a poor Girl, puts
you besides your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why does she talk so irreverently then of
sacred Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>If you will espouse a ridiculous Cause,
you must expect to be made the Ridicule of all you
talk with.</P>

<P>I would advise you to talk with no Wo∣men

can do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Brother is a little passionate, Madam;
let me prevail with you to abate your Warmth a
little too: he complains of some hard Usage in the
Family, and, perhaps, is the sooner moved on that
Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad he has a Gentleman of so much
Temper to associate with him; it inay be a Security
to him, if he comes into Company: I can assure you,
he has had no hard Usage among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is grating to him, to have the <HI>Catho∣lick
Religion</HI> jested with; and, as he calls it, insult∣ed,
calling it a bloody and persecuting Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I said, Sir, we must be imposed upon,
by all the History of former Times, if it is not
so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, as I hinted too, if you look
into other Histories, you will find, that the Primi∣tive
Christians suffered Persecution from the Pagan
Government, with that glorious Constancy, as is,
to this Day, the Subject of Praises to God from all
the Catholick Church; who give Thanks for the
whole Army of Saints and Martyrs, who sacrificed
their Lives for the Catholick Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I have heard of that too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, and was not that the same
Catholick Church, which still retains the glorious
Name of <HI>Universal?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the true Primitive Christian Church,
Sir, planted by Christ himself and his Apostles, I
make do doubt of that; but I do not see what the
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
Papists have to value themselves for upon that
Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, are not those you call Pa∣pists,
the Successors of the same Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, they may be their Successors in se∣veral
Things; but wofully degenerated in both Prin∣ciples
and Practice, as I have been fully informed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Madam; there may have been
some Ceremony introduced into Worship, which the
Church had always Power to appoint; but I hope
the Doctrine is the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of another Opinion, Sir; I am mistaken,
if their Doctrine is the same, almost in any one
Thing: they are fallen off in all the essential Points
of Faith; and tho' I am not qualified to go over
them all, one by one; and you Gentlemen of Let∣ters,
are able to overcome me in your Forms of Ar∣guments;
yet I can go over them enough to satisfy
my self, and that is sufficient to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ay, ay, Sister, you are easily able to believe
your self, and so you are a Match for every Body.</P>
</SP>

<P>I believe my self a Match for you, Brother,
in this particular, tho' not for this Gentleman; he

I am loth Truth should be ill-defended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

off from the Primitive Purity, and cannot tell in
what? That is Shuffling with a good Face.</P>

of Fact, than any other Bishop, or Parish-Priest
in the Nation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Pope's Claim to the Primacy, and to be
Universal Bishop, which I can prove to be an
Usurpation; and that it was never claimed by
any of the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> it self, for Six
Hundred Years after Christ.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Their deposing Princes, and dissolving the Al∣legiance

<P>These, and a great many more, such as these, I

</SP>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, they deny the Pope the Power of Ab∣solution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gent.</SPEAKER>
<P>That can never be deny'd; every private
Confessor has it, by virtue of that Power given by
our Saviour to St. <HI>Peter, Mat.</HI> xvi. 18. <HI>Whatsoever
thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in</HI> Heaven,
<HI>and whatsoever thou shalt loose on</HI> Earth, <HI>shall be
loosed</HI> in Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I insisted on those Words; and that St. <HI>Peter</HI>
gave that Power to his Successor, the Pope; and,
by the same Succession, to all the Popes; and, by
the Popes, to their Priests, to the End of the World.</P>
</SP>

<P>But you know, don't you, what the Child

<P>I cannot remember all her foolish Tattle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll put you in Mind of some of it then,
Brother; She ask'd you, if St. <HI>Peter</HI> gave <HI>Christ</HI> any
Money for that Power of granting Indulgences? At
which, if you remember, we all fell a-laughing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="89" REF="103"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and you might be ashamed to mention
it again, I think; for you ought to have laugh'd at
her, or have reprov'd her for her ill Manners; for
that Question was both rude and silly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Brother, I must acknowledge I
thought it was neither; for, 1st, the Child did not
speak it rudely; and, 2d, there is more in it than
wiser People might have said, and a great deal more
in it than you were able to answer then, or, I be∣lieve,
are yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see nothing in it; 'tis plain the Power of
Absolution is given to the Church, in the Person of
St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would engage you and I into a long
Discourse, if we should enquire how far this Power
of Absolution extends; and how it is given to
the Church; and I mould prove easily that so much
of it as was practis'd in the Primitive Church, was
practis'd in quite a different Manner from what the
<HI>Papists</HI> now use it in; and that even in that Case the
Church of <HI>Rome</HI> is corrupted and degenerated: But
I choose to do as the Child did, and, waving that
Question, come to the other, about the Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you first grant me that the Church has
Power to grant Absolution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I should, for Discourse-sake, and for
the present Purpose, suppose it were so, (tho' I do
not grant it) does it follow that the Church has
Power to sell those Pardons for Money; to set a
certain Rate upon them; and distinguish the Price of
one Sin from another; or, in a Word, like Books
sold by Auction, sell them to who bids most?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Slander, the Fact cannot be prov'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Brother, 'tis not a Slander; if you
look into the History of those Times, you will find
that this selling of Pardons, in such a scandalous
Manner, by <HI>Eugenius,</HI> the Pope's Pardon-Factor in
<HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> was the first Thing that gave a
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
Shock to the People of that Country, and of all
<HI>Germany;</HI> and being farther expos'd by the Preach∣ing
of <HI>Luther;</HI> that very Absurdity may be said to
have begun the Reformation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, that impudent Monk made those
Things his Excuse; I neither know or believe any
more of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It matters not, what you please to be∣lieve,
or not to believe; 'tis not to be denied; the
whole World were Witnesses to it; the very Papists;
themselves were ashamed of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But, Brother, you forget the chief Part of
little <HI>Tab</HI>'s Discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is very possible, I may; for she said a
great many pretty Things to him: pray, what is it
I have omitted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you remember, how she turn'd short
upon him, and said, <HI>But this is not all,</HI> Brother,
<HI>Pray does not the Pope sell People Licenses to sin too,
or Time to come?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I remember it very well, by the
same Token, my Brother deny'd it, and flew in
such a Passion, that he frighted the Child, and set
her a crying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might well deny it; but this is all the Effect
of my Father's telling you all a Parcel of <HI>Chimney-corner
Stories,</HI> to ridicule the Catholicks, and expose the
true Christian Religion to Scorn and Contempt.</P>
</SP>

<P>How can you deny it, Brother? do you
not know, that the Pope grants Indulgences for cer∣tain
Sins, however criminal? Nay, for all Sins at a
Venture, for a certain Term of Years to come;
let them, be guilty of whatsoever Sins they will,
or can commit within that Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I deny it, and it is the unfair and unjust Re∣presentations
of those Things; which make you He∣reticks
so obstinate.</P>

<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Brother, we do not misrepresent
them at all; the Fact is plain; you may deny what
you please, but it is not to be contradicted: I can
prove it, not only from the Practice of your Popish
Priests, but from the Writings of the most eminent
Casuists in your Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You read our Writers to your Children, and
Ignorant People, just in such a Sense as you would

<P>Why when you are charg'd with these Ab∣surdities,
such as Pardons and Dispensations, if you
are arguing with Men of tolerable Capacities, then
you deny the Fact, and will not own that the
Church gives out any Pardons or Indulgences or
Dispensations at all: But if you talk with ignorant
and weak People, then you justify them, and insist
upon it, that such Things are lawful and useful in
the Church; that they ought to be, and a due Re∣gard
ought to be paid to them. So you play Leger∣demain
with the World, as best serves your Oc∣casion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all Raillery; there's nothing in it but
Abuse and Injustice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you put me upon the Proof of it, that's
another Case; I assure you I am ready to prove
every Word of it, and much more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will you prove? That the Church
grants Indulgences? We own that, and insist that se
<PB N="92" REF="106"/>
has Power to do so, and that Christ gave her
the Power; I nam'd you the Commission given to
<HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's going from the Point, Brother;
did Christ give St. <HI>Peter</HI> Authority to sell Pardons
and Dispensations for Money, and in the scandalous
Manner we speak of? And was it given like an Inhe∣ritance
to him, and his Heirs for ever? You will
find it hard to make out that Part, Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>First it must be determin'd, had he Power
given him to <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>loose?</HI> If he had, he had
Power also to depute that Authority to his Suc∣cessors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not grant that neither; but to wave
it for the present: Did Christ give <HI>Peter</HI> Power to
grant me Leave to sin for Twenty or Thirty Years
together, and to pardon all those Sins before-hand,
before they were committed? Had <HI>Peter</HI> this Power?
If he had, pray, when was it given him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the very Thing his little Sister <HI>Tab.</HI>
put to him; only the Child could not put it into
such good Order and Words as you do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sister, I think she did that too; I
am sure she spoke it so naturally, and in such pretty
innocent Expressions, that we were all very well
pleased with her, and I am only telling her Tale
over again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think 'tis a Child's Tale still, let who will
tell it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You won't call that answering it, I sup∣pose,
Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is enough, Christ gave St. <HI>Peter</HI> the Power
to <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>loose,</HI> as you see in the Text; the Church
is the Interpreter of Scripture, and can alone tell
how far that Power extends; nay, the Church can
extend it as the infallible Spirit directs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed Popery, in the Abstract:
You say, the Church has this Power, but you do
<PB N="93" REF="107"/>
not prove it; we deny it; and it lies upon you to
prove the Affirmative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>We know it, and that's enough to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we that are Protestants cannot take
Truths of that Consequence upon such sorry Evi∣dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Evidence would you have?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Scripture: You bring Scripture to
prove that Peter had the Power to <HI>bind</HI> and <HI>loose.</HI> If
Christ had given this Power, so extended, to <HI>Peter,</HI>
and whoever he should depute it to, 'tis reasonable
to believe the same Scripture would have said so:
But the Scripture neither gives the Power in such a
Manner, nor extends it to such a Length. You have
the like Presumption in your pretending, that the
Pope comes to be Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> by Succession from
St. <HI>Peter,</HI> when you cannot prove St. <HI>Peter</HI> was ever
Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> himself, or indeed that he was ever
at <HI>Rome</HI> in his Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's another Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so; but I think you have said as
much of the first as you can say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have said as much as need to be said; for I
have brought it to the Foundation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P. Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, only with this Difference, that your
Foundation is the Church, and our Foundation is
the Scripture; your Authority is the Voice of Men,
<HI>fallible Men!</HI> ours is the Word of God; that Word
of which himself has said, HEAVEN <HI>and</HI> EARTH
<HI>shall pass away, but my</HI> WORD shall not pass away?
Luke xxi. 33. And this, I think, is the grand Di∣stinction
between a <HI>Protestant</HI> and a <HI>Papist;</HI> namely,
the one builds his Faith on the infallible eternal
Word of GOD; and the other rests upon the San∣ction
of the Church; that is to say, a Body of
mortal, fallible Men, subject to Error, and often fall∣ing
into Error; differing from the great Pattern of
Truth, the blessed Saviour of the World; and dif∣fering
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
frequently from one another, to a most scan∣dalous
Heighth. Let this be the Difference between
us for ever, till it shall please God to enlighten the
World, by his blessed Spirit, in a more clear and
effectual Manner, so as to bring all Men to the saving
Knowledge of the Truth, and that this Knowledge
may <HI>fill the Earth, as the Watters cover the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Their Discourse broke off here, for the present,
and they parted tolerably civil; tho' the Brother
seem'd to be warm to the last, and to resent his ill
Treatment, as he call'd it, in the Family; and that
he was unkindly used by his Father: Upon which,
they had, afterwards, a Discourse by it self which,
as not relating to this Subject, I omit: Only thus far
'tis necessary to mention (<HI>viz.</HI>) that it produced
another Meeting among them, with some Friends
on both Sides; in which it was agreed, that their
elder Brother should write a submissive Letter to his
Father; and that those Friends, with his other Brother
and Sister, should do their good Offices with their
Father, to bring about a Reconciliation.</P>
<P>It is but too easy a Work, sometimes, to bring
a tender, affectionate, and religious Parent to accept
of the least Advances made by a disobliging Child,
towards an Acknowledgment and Return: Nothing
is sooner imposed upon, in such Cases, than a Fa∣ther
desirous of his Son's Amendment; nothing wil∣linger,
and apter to believe the seeming Penitent
sincere; and this was the Case here.</P>
<P>Upon the receiving a submissive Letter from his
Son, and some interposing Friends speaking to it at the
same Time, the good Gentleman, with Tears in his
Eyes, presently forgave the former Conduct of his
Son, and consented to a Reconciliation; tho' he saw,
with a sad Heart, that it must be without reclaiming
him from his Errors in Religion, which he was
oblig'd to leave to the Divine Mercy; in which, as he
said, he could do no more than pray for him.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="109"/>
However, when the Friends, who acted as Medi∣ators
between them, came to speak to him of that
Point, <HI>viz.</HI> his forewarning, or forbidding his Son
from coming to his House, they found it difficult to
get over it; and the Difficulty lay upon this particu∣lar
Article, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Father, knowing his Son's
insinuating Temper, was afraid he should delude his
Brothers and Sisters, who were yet but young, and
draw them over to his Opinions; and therefore, tho'
he did at last yield to his coming to the House, and
conversing with the Family, and sometimes to lodge
in his House; yet he was inflexible in this Part, that
he would not consent to it, but upon express Con∣dition,
that he should never enter into any Discourses
with his Brothers and Sisters, upon any religious
Points whatever; but especially such as were in Dis∣pute
between the Papists and the Protestants, except
when his Father was present.</P>
<P>This Condition, the Son agreed to, tho' with some
apparent Reluctcance; and with a kind of Insult, or
Triumph, as if he would insinuate, that his Father
was sensible, that the Popish Arguments would be too
strong for the Protestants; and that he should be
wanted to quash Things by his Authority, where
Reason would be defective. In short, that his Father
was sensible he should have the Better of them, and
therefore, was afraid to trust it to a Dispute.</P>
<P>However, as this did not reach his Father's Ears,
and that he yielded to the Condition, the Recon∣ciliation
was made, and he was received in the Fa∣mily
again; that is to say, as a Brother and as a Son,
tho' not an Inhabitant; and his going Abroad again,
was adjourned for the present.</P>
<P>It was plain, that, however he consented to the
Condition of forbearing all religious Disputes, and
Insinuations of Popery in the Family, he never in∣tended
to be bound by, or to perform it; which,
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
in the End, brought on a second Breach between his
Father and him, as you will see in the rest of the Story.</P>
<P>Not his Father only, but all his Brothers and Si∣sters,
received him with open Arms, and gave him
innumerable Testimonies of a sincere Affection, and
a complete Reconciliation; and they liv'd, for a
Time, in perfect Amity, forgetting all that had
pass'd, and conversing with all possible Freedom and
Kindness.</P>
<P>But he could not be content with the Liberty al∣low'd
him; and as he never intended to keep within
the Bounds or Limitations which were set him by his
Father, so he soon discover'd it; for he would be
always entring into Disputes with them about Reli∣gion,
wheedling with the younger Children (espe∣cially);
for he did not much care to engage with his
eldest Protestant Brother, or with his eldest Sister.</P>
<P>Also he brought his Friend often with him, the
grave Gentleman that was with him before: Their
Friend acted with the utmost Cunning, and pruden∣tially
keeping himself always under a kind of Re∣serve
of Civility, seldom offered to interpose when
they were debating, never beginning any Dispute
himself, and always moderating when they were
any thing warm; for the Brother was often apt to
be hot and passionate, and then the Stranger would
always seem to be against him, and so bring him to
Temper again.</P>
<P>But under this cautious and reserv'd Behaviour,
he had infinite Advantage, and he fail'd not to
make me of it, with the utmost Artifice, to insinuate
their Popish Delusions with all the possible Gildings
and Varnish, that plausible Error could have Occa∣sion
for.</P>
<P>He took this Caution tho', that he always began
these Discourses with some other Subject, perfectly
remote; and generally he introduc'd them with cu∣rious
Observations upon Astronomical or Philosophi∣cal
<PB N="97" REF="111"/>
Points, pretending to acquaint the young inqui∣ring
Heads with the Motions of the Heavenly Bo∣dies,
their Revolutions and Influences, always clo∣sing
them with handsome and just Remarks upon
the Wisdom of the Creator, and the Power and
Government of his Providence, and such serious Re∣flections
as tended to prepossess the young People
very much in his Favour, as a very good Man, and
whole Religion, <HI>be it what it would,</HI> led him to
make the belt Use of every thing, and that turn'd
all his Discourses to a good End.</P>
<P>Having thus insinuated himself into their good
Opinion, and that upon a Foundation so reasonable,
he had this Advantage by it, that it added a Weight
to whatever he said upon any other Subject: By
this Artifice, he gradually brought into Discourse
religious Subjects of other Kinds, and especially
such as render'd Popery less differing from other Opi∣nions;
such as the <HI>Being</HI> of a GOD, against Atheists;
the Influence and Government of his Providence in
the smallest Matters, in Opposition to <HI>Scepticism</HI> and
<HI>Deism;</HI> the Divinity of Christ, against the <HI>Arians</HI>
and <HI>Socinians;</HI> the Authority of Scripture, and the
like; not failing on the Occasion now and then, but
with the utmost Subtlety and Caution, to bring in
the Difficulty of understanding some particular Text
in the Scriptures, and the Necessity of an infallible
Interpretation, and how the Interpretation of all
Scripture should be left to the Church, and so, at
last, to the Head of the Church, the <HI>Pope.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in short, he gave Popery a sure Footing in
the Minds of the younger Children, even while they
themselves knew nothing of the Matter; Nor was
their Brother's Discourse with them near so dan∣gerous
as that of this subtle Manager; for the Bro∣ther
brought in his Popery like a new Convert in∣deed,
with Heat and Passion, barefac'd, and pro∣fessedly;
but the other couched it in the most artful
<PB N="98" REF="112"/>
Manner, under the Cover of those Things in which
we all agree; leaving upon their Minds first a kind
of favourable Impression of the Popish Religion in
general, as not differing from us so much as they
had supposed, or been told it did; and as agreeing
in the most essential Points, and so making Room
for the Reception of the erroneous Part, as Things
indifferent, or at least not so essential; and which,
being to be left to the Decision of the Church and
of the Priests, lay upon them to defend and to
answer for, if not right: And had their Brother
acted with the same Craft as this grave Person did,
who, by the Way, was certainly a <HI>Popish Priest,</HI> and
the same who had perverted their Brother; I say,
had he acted as artfully as the Priest, they had gone
a great Way to have poison'd the whole Family, as
to Principles; and, perhaps, planted Popery too
deep for all the pious Father's Endeavours to have
rooted it out again.</P>
<P>But the Brother did not see so far into Things,
as the graver Gentleman did, nor had he Patience
enough to carry it on with a suitable Policy: But
his Precipitation undid the whole Work, discover'd
the Breach of his limited Agreement, and brought
his Father and him to a new Quarrel, which put
an End, for a while, to the whole Design.</P>
<P>It is true, however, this was not presently; no,
nor did the Father immediately differ with him,
tho' he knew that he did now and then break
out of his Bounds, being 10th, if it could have
been avoided, to come to Extremities with him.
But this occasion'd other Measures on every Side;
for the Children, especially the eldest Daughter,
who was the Champion of the Family, under her
Father, always had Recourse to her Father, when
either her Brother, or that artful Gentlemen had
offer'd any thing difficult; and she never fail'd to
come back fortify'd against their Sophistry, and
<PB N="99" REF="113"/>
made able both to confirm the young Children,
and confute him; and the happy Event of this
Method we shall see as we go on: In the mean
time, when her Father found his Son had been
pushing at them, I mean the rest of his Children,
with his Popish Arguments, and that he seem'd to
make some Impression on them, he frequently took
the Opportunity to talk with them also upon the
same Points, that he might see whether his Son's
Discourse had done any Mischief, or no; and that
he might fortify them against it: And this was the
Original of the following Dialogues.</P>
</SP>
<TRAILER>The End of the Third <HI>DIALOGUE.</HI></TRAILER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS I have observ'd in the former Dialogues,
that the Father perceiv'd his Son, notwith∣standing
the Injunction he had laid upon him, and
which he had voluntarily consented to, did yet
daily break his Promise, and frequently engag'd the
Children in Discourses, and Sometimes in Disputes
upon the Subject of Religion; and, which was
worse, that he found those Disputes made some
dangerous Impressions upon them, he resolv'd upon
a very particular Method for the establishing the
Minds of his Children in the Truth of Religion.</P>
<P>He call'd them all together one Evening, and
told them, that he found, <HI>as above,</HI> their Bro∣ther,
notwithstanding he had engag'd to the con∣trary
was continually battering them with his
Popish Delusions; that he prompted them to Dis∣putes
<PB N="100" REF="114"/>
and tedious Debates upon the Subject of his
Religion; that he had Recourse every Day to his
Priests to furnish him with Sophistry and Cavil, to
direct him how to puzzle them with Arguments;
and that he flatter'd himself with Success, perhaps,
from their being unable to answer him to all his par∣ticular
Fallacies and Quibbles: He told them also,
that he understood he brought a Gentleman (per∣haps
a Priest, <HI>says the Father</HI>) to assist him in his
carrying on these Disputes, which was still a farther
Breach of the Terms upon which he consented to
admit him again into the Family: That he, the Fa∣ther,
had Reason to resent this Conduct of his Son,
and withal he added, that he did not take it well
that they had enter'd into these Debates with him,
and had suffer'd themselves to be thus harrass'd with
his Arguings and Disputes, and had not acquainted
him with it, at the same Time they knowing it was
contrary to his Capitulation with their Brother;
and also, that it left them without the Assistance
which he might have given them to defend them∣selves.</P>
<P>His eldest Daughter, for to her he seem'd to di∣rect
his Discourse, answer'd, in Behalf of the rest,
That it was true, their Brother had frequently at∣tack'd
them, and engag'd them in little Disputes
about <HI>Popery;</HI> but that as for the Gentleman that
came with him, they must needs say, he always be∣hav'd
with so much Modesty and Civility, that
there was not the least Room to suspect him of any
Design; and that he often reprov'd their Brother,
and check'd him for being so warm in his Discourse;
that he always avoided religious Disputes, but en∣tertain'd
them with curious and pleasant Observations
upon other Subjects.</P>
<P>Here her Father interrupted her a little warmly:
Other Subjects! <HI>said be,</HI> what Subject could he
discourse of, that a subtle designing Head could not
<PB N="101" REF="115"/>
turn to pernicious Ends? But answer me this, Is the
Man a Papist, or is he not?</P>
<P>They said, they acknowledg'd he seem'd to be on
that Side, but he behav'd with so much <HI>Moderation,</HI>
that it was not easy to say positively whether he
was a Papist, or no.</P>
<P>Moderation! <HI>says the Father,</HI> you should say
Cunning.</P>
<P>They all seem'd to take it amiss, in Behalf of the
grave Gentleman, and repeating to their Father
the general Tenour of his Discourses, as I have
mention'd above, insisted, that he never so much
as nam'd the Disputes of Religion, or any thing
about it, but always shun'd them: So effectually had
he blinded them by his artful engaging Manner,
chat they really did not see the Popery which lay
at the Bottom of it all.</P>
<P>Well, well, <HI>says the Father,</HI> I see he is a Papist
for all that, and I doubt not but he is a <HI>Popish
Priest</HI> too, as I told you before, and all this Smooth∣ness
is but an artful Way to wheedle you into an
Opinion of his Modesty and Sincerity, that he may
find the Way into your Opinion, and add Weight
to what he may say, when he thinks fit to discover
himself more fully.</P>
<P>His Daughter seem'd not to come into her Father's
bad Opinion of the Man, no more did any of the
rest; but thought he wrong'd him very much in
suggesting that he was a designing Man: But how∣ever
she said, tho' they were very sorry to lose him,
yet seeing he, their Father, thought there was Dan∣ger
in it, it was in his Power to dismiss both of
them again, in order to make himself easy, and
that they mould submit to it, let it be how it
would.</P>
<P>Their Father, after some Pause, told them No,
he would not forbid their Brother, nor his Friend
coming to the House, no nor to go on with their
<PB N="102" REF="116"/>
Disputings, and other Methods for carrying on
their Popish Designs, for that would be to interpose
Power instead of Argument; but he would be con∣tent
they should go on as they pleased, and do their
utmost for their Cause, upon Condition they (his
Children) would promise him, that every Time they
had any of these Engagements with their Brother
or his Friend, they would give him an Account of
the Points they argued upon, and, as near as they
could remember, what they had to say for them;
not that he would enter into any more Disputes
with his Son, for that had been resolv'd before;
but that he might, as was his Duty, and he hop'd
would be for their Benefit, give them a right Infor∣mation,
arm them against Delusions and Error, and
set the Questions in a true Light; that so they might
judge for themselves between GOD and <HI>Baal,</HI> be∣tween
true Religion and Idolatry; for, <HI>said their
Fatter,</HI> I cannot satisfy myself by any Means to
have my Children impos'd upon and deluded, and
not be able to open their Eyes, and give them
a true Knowledge of Things; but let me have but
Room to answer, and to inform them, and set them
to rights, when they are deceiv'd, I desire no more,
let their Brother and his Priest do their worst.</P>
<P>They readily acknowledg'd that the Proposal was
very reasonable, and promised accordingly that they
would give him a true Account of every Dispute
that should happen among them, and, as near as
they could remember, the Arguments that were used
to prevail upon them.</P>
<P>I matter not their Arguments, <HI>says the Father,</HI>
let me but know the Subject m Debate; I shall
satisfy myself with giving you a true State of the
Case, with the Historical Account of Facts, as they
lie, and as they are to be prov'd, and I dare ven∣ture
it, that, with God's Blessing, the mere History
of Popery, in any Branch of it, and in any Part
<PB N="103" REF="117"/>
they can dispute about, is enough, when rightly re∣lated,
to secure any Protestant from being deluded
by them, in almost any Case that can be disputed
upon.</P>
<P>Having thus brought his Children to consent to
his Proposal, there was no Notice taken of it to the
eldest Son their Popish Brother: But he came and
went, and his Friend with him; and they wrangled
and disputed daily about Religion, as before; never
knowing that his Father had any Information of it;
nor did he so much as suspect it, On the contrary,
he concluded, that if his Father had known it, he
Should soon have found the Effect of his Resent∣ment;
as he did at last, tho' upon a quite different
Occasion.</P>
<P>As this was the State of the Case, it could not be
long before the Brother gave an Occasion for the
Father to begin his Instructions to his Children in
the manner proposed; and the Subject, which first
offer'd to be discours'd upon was, upon the Word
<HI>Catholick Church;</HI> which his Popish Son always took
Notice of, and laid a mighty Stress upon, in his
Discourses among the other Children; telling them,
that there was but one Church of Christ in the
World, and that was the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> That
this was in ail Ages said to be the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI>
and that was to say the only and <HI>Universal Church:</HI>
He spent a great deal of learned Pains to prove to
them, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Church was always call'd <HI>Ca∣tholick;</HI>
and that to be Catholick signified Universal;
and that therefore the <HI>Roman</HI> Church was the Uni∣versal
Church; out of which there could be no Sal∣vation.</P>
<P>His Sister was a little shock'd with that Part of
the Discourse; and told her Father, that she was so.
<HI>Indeed, Sir,</HI> says she, <HI>I find my Brother is always
upon the Catch with me;</HI> and it makes me suspect
<PB N="104" REF="118"/>
there is some Fraud, some Double-meaning, in every
thins he says; but I cannot find it out yet.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it may be found out, Child, tho'
you don't see it at first; for almost every Part of
Popery is built upon Fraud and Cheat; and there∣fore
let me hear what it is in particular he has so
much the Advantage of you in; perhaps I may un∣riddle
it to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it does seem to me, according to
Protestant Principles, that there is but one Church,
one True Church of Christ in the World, where∣soever
and howsoever dispers'd among all the Na∣tions
of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose that; for, according to our
Principles, it is true, the Church of Christ is the
whole Body of Believers, where-ever and however
dispers'd, as you say in the World, tho' we do call
every particular Society of Christians a Church; and
so does the Apostle, even when he speaks but of a
Family, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 2. <HI>To the Church in thy House;</HI> and
in the 2d of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> the Societies of Christ
in several Cities, are called the Churches; yet, when
we speak in general of the Church, or of Christ's
Church, we mean the whole Body of Christians in
the World, professing one Faith, united in one Hope,
believing in one and the same God, and under one
supreme Government, even that of Jesus Christ,
who is the only Head of his Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this I understand, but he talks of those
things in another, and a narrower Sense; and gives
it a particular Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Name, Child? I suppose he calls it the
<HI>Catholick Church;</HI> does he not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does he say he means by that?
does he not pretend, that this <HI>Catholick Church</HI> is the
Church of <HI>Rome?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and says, that there is no Salvation
but in that Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what does he pretend to mean by the
Word Catholick, and Catholick Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! he says, he takes it for granted,
that we understand, that to say the Catholick
Church, is to say, the Universal Church, containing
all the whole Body of Believers in the World; and
as there are none can be saved, but who believe in
Christ; so there are no true Believers, but what are
within the Pale of this Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what does he infer From hence,
then? I hope we that are Protestants are within the
Pale of this Church; for we believe in Chnrist; and
so there is no Harm done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, he will not allow that; He says,
this Catholick Church is the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> only,
and the Protestants are all Hereticks; are shut out
from the Catholick Church; and therefore cannot
be sav'd till they return, and are received into the
Bosom of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how does he prove all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir! He says so many plausible things,
that we don't know how to answer; and tho' I
think he will never make a Papist of me, because
I have seen so many simple things among them; yet
I don't know what to say for my Brothers and Si∣sters;
I am afraid of them; for he makes strange
Impressions upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so! I am sorry to hear it: But I don't
doubt I shall make all his plausible Stories appear,
as they really are, no more than Plausible and Sto∣ries.
Pray call them in, and let me talk to you all
together.</P>
<P>Here his Daughter brought them all together,
and the Father, beginning where she left off,
told them, he was sorry to hear that their
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
elder Brother, who was already poison'd in
his own Principles by the Artifice of the Priests,
should get ground among them, and pretend to
delude them into Popery; that he thought
they had been all along carefully instructed
in the Christian Doctrines, and particularly in
Protestant Principles, in Proportion to what
their Age made them capable to receive; and
he had always, as Occasion presented, warn'd
them against Popery, and Popish Errors, tho'
he did not foresee they would be assaulted thus
in their young Days, and within his own Doors
too; but since it was so, and seeing also they
were now all come to Years of Understanding,
to be able to judge of Things better than
they were when they were taught by their Ca∣techisms,
and by the ordinary Instructions of
their Mother, when she was living; and by
reading Books, hearing Protestant Ministers
preach, and the like; he would take upon
him to run thro' all the Principles of Popery
with them, that is to say, those that their Bro∣ther
had insisted so much upon, and furnish
them with sufficient Arguments to prevent their
being deluded by him.</P>
<P>Then, directing his Discourse to his eldest Daughter,
to whom he was talking before, he repeated what
she had told him, and bad the rest take Notice
of it.</P>
<P>When he came to speak of that Part of their
Brother's Arguments (<HI>viz.</HI>) of the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> being the true Catholick Church, he turn'd
his Speech to them all; Thus I suppose, said he,
your Brother argues, That as there is no being
saved out of the Bosom of Christ's Church, or,
as he calls it, the Catholick Church, so the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> being the Catholick Church, there is no
<PB N="107" REF="121"/>
being sav'd till you are reconcil'd to, and receiv'd
into the Bosom of the Church of <HI>Rome:</HI> Is not this
the State of the Case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, says the Daughter; and so they
all said too; for as the Father, I say, had turn'd his
Discourse to them all, so he ask'd them all the
Question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, daughter, I see I must take my old
Method with Popery, which I always found was
the best and most proper Means to fence against it;
namely, to fortify your Minds in the Truth, by
shewing you the Falshood and Fallacy of Popery in
general, and of all the Arguments in particular,
which the Papists make use of to support it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, Sir, you used to tell my
Brother such black Stories of them, as made him
half distracted; for first he was, as it were, resolv'd
not to believe them, and yet, in the next Place, he
could not confute them; or deny the Matters of
Fact; and he was so provok'd sometimes, that we
could hear him curse us all for damn'd Hereticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I don't doubt that, Father and all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, good Manners made him forbear
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what his Manners might do to re∣strain
him, but I am well satisfy'd his Principles
would not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he reproaches us all still with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reproach you, Child! with what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he says you treated the Catholick
Church with Jest and Ridicule, and brought up old
Stories, instead of Arguments, against her; that
you always turn'd the Discourse, which he began
with the greatest Seriousness, into Banter, and end∣ed
it all with telling a Tale.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child; but could he say that I ever
told one Story of them but what was true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, we did not come to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="108" REF="122"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you shall go farther with me: Did I
ever bring in any things, however ridiculous and ab∣surd,
but what I had their own <HI>Legends, Missals,
Church-Registers,</HI> or other authentick <HI>Books,</HI> written
by their own Authors, to support?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did not go so far with him neither;
for we could not examine them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but when you meet with it again, you
may ask him the Question; I suppose he will give
you Opportunity enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Yes: He is always reproaching us
with it; that this or that is one of my Father's old
Chimney-Corner Stories against the <HI>Roman</HI> Catho∣licks;
and that it Is the way of the Hereticks, for
Want of Argument, to make Ballads and Songs of
the most sacred things; turning it all to Banter and
Ribaldry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but bring him close to it: Tell him
your Father never brought any Stories, or Ballads,
or Songs, into his Discourse, but what were their
own; and if they made such Stories and Ballads
themselves, as expos'd them to the Jest and Con∣tempt
of the World, whose Fault was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>We can say that to him at any Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Child; you mean, I sup∣pose,
that you can say it, but that he will deny it,
and ask you to prove it: Now I will undertake to
prove it of every Thing that comes out of my
Mouth, and so make you able to prove it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very glad of that; I am sure,
he sahll not want it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, indeed, the easiest Thing in the World,
to expose Popery to Ridicule, from their own Books,
from the Extravagancies of their own Enthusiasms,
and the Stupidity of their own Clergy; and from
thence it is, that I have always said, and repeat it
now, that the best Way to confute and confound a
Papist, and to confirm Protestants in their Abhor∣rence
<PB N="109" REF="123"/>
of the Popish Delusions, is to do no more than
to strip her naked, and hang her out in the open
Air; that by a clear and undisguised Sight of her,
every Christian may judge for himself, which is most
likely to be the faithful and true Spouse of Christ,
the Protestant or the Popish Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, does he complain so much of
being injured, and of being expos'd? If they have
expos'd themselves, 'tis their own Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it turn upon that Issue, and let it be seen,
whether they are not the Publishers of their own
Shame: As to the Question, Whether it be their
Fault, or whether it is an Infatuation from Heaven
upon them? That's a Question of another Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Brother pretends, 'tis the <HI>Devil</HI> who
sets on the Hereticks to buffoon the Church; I use
his own Words; and to persecute the Servants of
Christ, the <HI>Pope</HI> and his Clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, whether the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>
be the Church of Christ, or the Pope and his Clergy
be the Servants of Christ, and who are the Persecu∣tors,
they, or the Protestants, will best appear, as I
said, by letting them out in their own Colours, dress∣ing
them up in their own Cloaths, and answering
them out of their own Mouths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, that's a Way will be the
most suited to our Capacities, and the easiest for us
to understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us begin then, at these Two Articles;
(1.) The Meaning of the Word Catholick, and that
it signifies Universal; and that therefore, the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> being the Catholick Church, is an Univer∣sal
Church; tho' I shall make it appear, she is nei∣ther
Catholick or Universal: And (2.) The Pope
being the Universal Bishop, or Supreme, and Head of
the Catholick Church; for upon these. Two
Points they build the whole Fabrick of Popery; and
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
'tis upon these Two Heads, it seems, that your
Brother pretends to argue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, it is so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, pray, ask your Brother, when
you are upon those Points again, if he remembers
one St. <HI>Pacianus,</HI> an eminent Father of their Church,
and who, in succeeding Times, was beatify'd, and
afterwards canonized?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be, he will say, he does not re∣member
such a Saint.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he will be ashamed to say so; for he
is one of the Saints who they pray to as an Interces∣sor,
in Spite of the Scripture, which says, there is
but one God, and one Mediator between GOD and
<HI>Man.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if he, suspecting what will fol∣low,
should not think fit to own him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he should not, bid him look in his <HI>Kalendar</HI>
for his Name; and tell him, you can find the Day
(if you look for it) when they celebrate a Mass in
Memory of him, and that you will put him in Mind
of it next Time you meet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, may we not know what this
Saint was, that we may be able to throw him into
my Brother's Way, if there is Occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, he was Bishop of <HI>Barcelona</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI>
he was born in the Fourth Century, and died in the
Year 480.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he was not called a Saint then,
I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he was beatifyed, as they call it, and
canonized many Ages after, when the Custom of
Canonizing ancient Fathers, was brought into the
Church: and they wanted Red-letter Men to grace
the Kalendar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, at first, they chose out good
Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="111" REF="125"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, and the most famous Men for their
Learning and Writings that they could find; and
therefore, I said, your Brother would not say, he
did not know St. <HI>Pacianus,</HI> for he was a very noted
Father of the Church, and was really a pious, good,
primitive, and Christian Bishop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if he owns him, Sir, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, ask him, if he will believe his
Testimony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, he will say NO; or will decline
answering till he knows the Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he dares not say, he won't believe
the Testimony of a canoniz'd Bishop of the <HI>Roman</HI>
Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is his Testimony given upon,
and in what Case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this very Case, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Mean∣ing
of the Word <HI>Catholick</HI> is not Universal. The
Case was this: This good Bishop, was a great Oppo∣ser
of the <HI>Novatians,</HI> a Sect of Hereticks your
Brother has heard of: What they were, we may talk
of another Time; but the Bishop writing an Epistle
to <HI>Sempronianus,</HI> against the <HI>Novatians;</HI> and speak∣ing
there of the Name of <HI>Catholick,</HI> and of its being
given to <HI>Christ's Church,</HI> has these Words.</P>
</SP>
<P>“Since the Ascension of Jesus Christ, <HI>says he,</HI>
notwithstanding the Mission of his infallible Spi∣rit,
there have appeared innumerable Sects and
Divisions in the Church, which have all been de∣nominated
from the Names of their Authors; but
the Name of CATHOLICK, <HI>says the old Bishop,</HI> has
been, alone, continued in the true Church of
Christ, and that, because she is the <HI>true Church;</HI>
for the Word or Name CATHOLICK, <HI>adds be,</HI> is
by the learned Men understood to mean obedi∣ent
(tho' commonly construed to mean, <HI>General,</HI> or
<HI>Universal</HI>): The true Church then, is only ho∣noured
with the Title of <HI>Catholick,</HI> because she is
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
the only Church, which is true and obedient to
the Commands of her Lord and Master, Christ:
They are <HI>Catholick</HI> because truly Christian, and
not Christian unless obedient to Christ. My
Name, says the Holy Father, is Christian, <HI>Christi∣anus
mihi nomen est, Catholicus Cognomen:</HI> My Name
is <HI>Christian,</HI> my Sur-name is <HI>Catholick;</HI> for I have
vowed my Obedience to my Lord and Master
Christ, whose Name I bear.” Thus far the Bi∣shop:
What strange Abuses then, have the Papists
put upon the Word Catholick? And how do they
falsly construe it to signify Infallible and Universal?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a plain Testimony against them in∣deed;
I fancy, my Brother knows nothing of this
Saint <HI>Pacianus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or at least, perhaps, he may know nothing
of this Epistle of his; but you may bid him look
for it among the celebrated Writings of that Saint,
and he shall certainly find it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will certainly give it him at full Length.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, when you do, ask him, if he
knows any other Title to give the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
instead of this of <HI>Catholick;</HI> for 'tis plain, that will
Hand them in no Stead, unless he will prove that
Church to be the most obedient of all other
Churches, and the most humble; and he will find
that a hard Task to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, Sir, he will talk no more of the
Word Catholick and Universal, after this Story is
told him; at least, not for a while, or not in the
Sense he has done all-along: But he has another
mighty Plea in Favour of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
which he nails us all down with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he says, That we Protestants ac∣knowledge
the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> was originally the
true Christian Church, and the only true Christian
Church in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="113" REF="127"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would he infer from thence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, but that he would have us
tell him, why it is not so now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what can be easier to do in the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what we are a little short in, and
he triumphs over us in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is only for want of knowing a little of the
History of Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Sir, we are not acquainted
with the History of Popery; no, nor enough with
the History of the Primitive Times of Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, a little History will serve to ex∣pose
his Church, for the greatest Seminary of Dege∣neracy
and Apostacy, that ever was in the World;
and nothing is more wonderful in it, than that they
should desire to have any Search made into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it true, that they were once the
only true Church, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, nothing like it: That the Church
of <HI>Rome</HI> was once a true Christian Church, is most
certain; that their Bishops were Holy Men, and ma∣ny
of them suffered Martyrdom for the Christian
Faith, all this we grant; but it amounts to no
more than this, that she was a Member of the Pri∣mitive
Church, not that she was the only Church,
or the whole Church; there is a great Difference be∣tween
being A Church, and being THE Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but he insists, that the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> was the only Church; that it was founded by
St. <HI>Peter,</HI> by Virtue of Christ's Words, that on <HI>this
Rock</HI> he (Christ) would build his Church; which
Church, is the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> of which, St. <HI>Peter</HI>
was the first Bishop, and gave all the Power that
Christ gave <HI>Peter, viz.</HI> of Binding and Loosing,
and of the <HI>Keys of Heaven,</HI> to the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI>
and their Successors, by whom it is kept up to this
Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a plausible Story, indeed; and this
I know, they make much Noise about, and it has
but one Misfortune attending it, which spoils all;
and that is, that there is not one Word of Truth
in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Is it not true, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> was
Bishop of <HI>Rome?</HI> And that he was Founder of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far from it, Child, that we do not find,
that he was ever at <HI>Rome</HI> at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surprized, Sir! Why, they build
their whole Church Fabrick upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Scripture does not say one Word of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, there must be Something in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have a great deal of Reason to think there
is not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not St. <HI>Peter</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome!</HI> Why, it
will make my Brother raving and distracted, he
would be in such a Passion, if we should but make
a Question of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray, do but ask him, how he proves
it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare not so much as suggest it to him:
Why, he calls him the First Bishop of the whole
Christian Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you, Child, he was so far from being
the First, that we do not believe he was ever Bishop
of any Church; he was an Apostle, indeed, but not
a Bishop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, they say he was an Apostle, and
Prince of the Apostles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that is a Popish Falshood too; 'tis plain,
St. <HI>Peter</HI> neither pretended to it himself, neither did
Christ ever erect such a Superiority among his Apo∣stles;
neither did any of the other Apostles acknow∣ledge
him to be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Papists are strange Folks then! Why,
did they invent all these Things themselves? Sure
<PB N="115" REF="129"/>
they have some Scripture to make it probable, or
same Authentick History to make it certain; for
they all insist, that <HI>Peter</HI> was the Prince of the
Apostles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is running from one Thing to another,
pray, let's take Things as they lie: First about his
being Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, if it be the same Thing to
you, pray, speak to his Dignity first, as Prince of
the Apostles, for they make a great Stir about
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, do so; I am indifferent., as to that, for
I shall make but short Work of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure they make a long Do about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to say, your Brother does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he lays a vast Stress upon it: St. <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>
is the greatest Man with him, that ever was in the
World, next to Christ himself; sure they must have
undeniable Authority for what they say of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All they have for it in the Scripture, is,
that he is often first named; as in <HI>Matth.</HI> x. and xvii.
and several other Places; and that on several Occa∣sions
he is said to speak, as it were, in the Name
of the rest; as in <HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 1, 2. and xiv. 38. and
several other Places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that Christ took him with him,
on several Occasions, when he left others out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that he answered Christ in the Name
of the rest of the Apostles, when our Saviour ask'd
them, <HI>Who do ye say that I am?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes; there he made the first Confes∣sion
of his Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then? He fully ballanc'd it after∣wards;
for he was the first; nay, the only Disciple
that ever den'y'd him, except <HI>Judas,</HI> that betrayed
him.</P>

<P>That's true, indeed, but they say no∣thing
of that.</P>

<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with this Aggravation too, that his Con∣fession
of Christ was in private, and only among
themselves; but his denying him was publick, and in
the Face of all the Crowd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he was the eldest Apostle too; he
was first called.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Mistake too; for his Brother <HI>Andrew</HI>
was called at the same Time. See the Text, <HI>Matth.</HI>
iv. 19. He saw them together, called them both
in the same Breath, not one after another; and they
both left their Nets together, and follow'd him toge∣ther;
so that there's no Seniority in that: They are,
if you will, the Two eldest; but in their Call, ay,
and in their Obedience to that Call, they are Twins;
there's no Primogeniture in the Heavenly Birth
among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true indeed; I wonder they can
take hold of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis usual with them to take hold where there
is no Hold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Drowning People indeed do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And theirs is a drowning Cause, and always
was, or they would never have fled to such pitiful
Shifts to support it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, their Cause in those Days, Sir, was
good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Child, not in those Days; that is to say,
not when they began to usurp the Primacy and su∣preme
Authority in God's Church; it was a Usur∣pation
in its Beginning; and to support it, they took
hold of these ridiculous things, these miserable Shifts;
and that they were such, I shall soon shew you: But I
let us keep to the Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I desire to may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>St. <HI>Peters,</HI> you say, they will have to be the
Prince of the Apostles, Chief among the Disciples;
and thence he is supposed to be the eldest Son of
Christ's Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="117" REF="131"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>See then what the Scripture says of it, and
what Christ himself says, whole Disciples they were,
and whose Laws they obey'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure that's the best Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Christ's Words are express; it seems they
were at it among themselves, even then setting up
for a Supremacy one over another; perhaps it was
<HI>Peter</HI> himself, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 43.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember the Case, in one Place 'tis
said, there began to be a Strife among them, which
should be Greatest; but it does not say it was
<HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's true, but, perhaps, it might:
However, the Answer is to them all; it is in <HI>Luke</HI>
xxii. 26. <HI>But ye shall not be so: But he that is greatest
among you, let him be as the Younger; and he that is
Chiefs as he that dotb serve.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, Sir, they say Christ gave the
chief Authority to <HI>Peter, Matth.</HI> xvi. 19. <HI>And I
will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Hea∣ven:
And whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth,</HI> shall
be bound in Heaven; And whatsoever thou shall loose
on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the grand Cheats of Popery:
'tis evident, that when Christ ask'd the Question, in
the 15th Verse of the Chapter, <HI>But whom say ye
that I am?</HI> That he spoke to all the Disciples, or at
least, to all that were present at that Time; so by
Consequence, <HI>Peter</HI> made the Answer in the Name
of them all; and in the Grant of Binding and Loos∣ing,
Opening and Shutting, was likewise to them all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Christ directs his Speech to <HI>Peter</HI>
only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, in that Place it is in express'd; but
you will see it is otherwise in another Evangelist,
whose Gospel is as true, and as canonical as St. <HI>Mat∣thew.</HI>
See for that Part, <HI>John</HI> xx. 23. <HI>Whose soever</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="132"/>
Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever Sins ye retain, they are retained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is general, indeed, but this was not
at the same Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If there be any Thing in that, 'tis to their
Disadvantage; for this last was the Words of Christ
after his Resurrection, when he was glorify'd, as he
himself calls it, and when he breathed on them, and
said, <HI>Receive ye the Holy Ghost.</HI> See the 22d Verse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, here seems to be no Room for an
Inequality in all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then go a little farther, and see how the
rest of the Apostles understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is material, indeed; did they ac∣knowledge
no Superiority to <HI>Peter?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not in the least, but declared against it
on many Occasions; particularly, St. <HI>Paul</HI> corrects
him, <HI>Gal,</HI> ii. 11. <HI>I wishstood him to the Face, because
be was to be blamed. Paul</HI> himself, in another Place,
says of himself, that <HI>James, Peter,</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> all of
them, gave to him the Right-hand or Fellowship,
<HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 9.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not seen, indeed, that <HI>Peter</HI> was their
Prince there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, St. <HI>Paul</HI> says of himself, that he came
not behind the chiefest of the Apostles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that was speaking of himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' it was, yet, as our Saviour says, in ano∣ther
Case, tho' he bare Record of himself, yet, his
Record was true; and so it was here, as appeared
in many other Particulars afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you said, Sir, that St. <HI>Peter</HI> did not
claim any Superiority himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did say so, for in his Epistle to the <HI>Jews</HI> dis∣persed
among the Gentiles, he gives there a quite
different Account of himself, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 1. <HI>the El∣ders
which are among you, I exhort, who am also an
Elder and a Witness.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="119" REF="133"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that is not Talking like a Prince;
he would have rather said, I command, than I ex∣hort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was so far from commanding, that we
find him commanded by the rest of the Disciples;
for the Apostles, which were at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> hearing
that <HI>Samaria</HI> had received the Word of God, sent
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to them, <HI>Acts</HI> viii. 14. Now, had
he been Prince of the Apostles, they would not have
taken upon them, to have sent him of an Errand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That seems reasonable, indeed; he seems
to be under Orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It all concurs together; if <HI>Paul</HI> was not infe∣rior
to the very Chief, then, neither <HI>Peter,</HI> or any
of them, were Superior to him. If <HI>Paul</HI> might
withstand him to the Face, and did charge him with
not walking according to the Truth; then <HI>Peter</HI> had
neither Superiority or Infallibility: If the Apostles
at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> had Power over <HI>Peter,</HI> to send him as
a Messenger upon their Business, then he was not
their Superior.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I think, Sir, they call'd him to an
Account once, for his Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They did so, and he was fain to plead his
Cause before them, and submit to their Judgment;
as you may see <HI>Acts</HI> xi. 2. They that were of the
Circumcision contended with him, saying, <HI>Thou
wentest in to Men uncircumcised, and didst eat with
them.</HI> There's a down-right Charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what said <HI>Peter?</HI> Did not he say,
What's that to you? Who gave you Power to ex∣amine
me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, far from answering short, as he
would have done, if he had been their Prince; He
stands up, and pleads for himself, <HI>rehearsing the
whole Matter from the Beginning;</HI> and by his doing
so, gave them Satisfaction, <HI>ver.</HI> 18.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="120" REF="134"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied, Sir; indeed I think there is
no Room for talking of <HI>Peter's</HI> Superiority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, and how could he give that to
those People, which he had not himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, but now for his being Bishop
of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee, Child, he never was a Bishop at
all, and never was at <HI>Rome</HI> at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to say, you believe so; I think
you said so before, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did so; but I go farther, for 'tis not
for us to prove the Negative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they say, he was at <HI>Rome,</HI> suffered
Martyrdom there, and is buried there, and was Bi∣shop
of the Church there; but they cannot prove
any of the Three, no, neither by the Scripture, or
by any History that may be depended upon for
true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what have we to say against it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, 'tis enough speaking of the Papists
who affirm it, to say they cannot prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it would be still more, to say some∣thing
to contradict it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first, Child, he had no Business there;
for he was particularly appointed to be the Apostle
of the Circumcision, and that his Business lay quite
another Way, <HI>Gal.</HI> xi. 7, 8.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there were <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>a few;</HI> but <HI>Peter</HI> was set apart, you see,
to go to the Circumcision, and therefore he went quite
another Way; namely, into <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Persia;</HI> and
his Epistles are both written from the East, that is
to say, from <HI>Babylon,</HI> and directed to the <HI>Jews</HI> that
were scatter'd about in those Eastern Countries of
<HI>Asia,</HI> such as <HI>Phrygia, Cappadocia,</HI> &amp;c. all Provinces
in <HI>Asia,</HI> on the Side of the <HI>Euxine Sea.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he never write to the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="121" REF="135"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not one Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor ever speak of his being Bishop of
<HI>Rome?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one Syllable, or of his being a Bishop at
all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis strange to me, how they should pre∣tend
so boldly to it! what, have they nothing to
found it upon, neither Scripture or History?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, their own lying Legends, and nothing
else; and even in that, they tell you the Story so
ridiculously, it is enough to make all the World
throw Stones at them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean, Sir, ridiculously?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll give you a Story for it, Child, if you will
promise not to laugh at your Brother, when you
tell it him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it exposes them so much, that I should
not help laughing at it, I had better, perhaps, not
tell it him at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I would have you tell him the Story
too, because it is a very good one, and will shew
him a little of the Foppery of the Church he has em∣braced,
and that in their more primitive Times;
for I believe the Thing is, at least, 150 Years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you can give the Time and
Place, and Persons, or else he will pretend not to
believe the Truth of it, but say, 'tis a Story made
by the Hereticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I'll give him good Vouchers for it;
the Story, and the Circumstances of it too, are very
well known; it was in our old Fire-and-Faggot
Days.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Time!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, and the Author was the famous Dr.

the very Words as it was printed, <HI>Anno</HI>

<STAGE>[I find this was a Piece of a Sermon of
Dr. <HI>Smith,</HI> preached to support the Doc∣trine
of Transubstantiation; his Words are
these:]</STAGE>
<P>MY Masters, you are in great Error con∣cerning
the Blessed Sacrament, and all
your Trust was in <HI>Cranmer, Ridley,</HI> and
<HI>Latimer;</HI> As for <HI>Latimer,</HI> he said, in open Dispu∣tation
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that he had no Learning in
that Matter, but out of <HI>Cranmer's</HI> Book. Be∣sides
this, I disputed with <HI>Latimer</HI> twent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

came from <HI>Ridley;</HI> And as for <HI>Ridley,</HI> I disput∣ed
with him my self, now at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the other
Day, and I proved my Argument thus: <HI>Ill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cui
Christus obviavit Romae, fuit Romae;▪ at Chri∣stus

That is,</HI> He who <HI>Christ</HI> met at <HI>Rome,</HI> was a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Rome;</HI> but <HI>Christ</HI> met <HI>Peter</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> Ergo
<HI>Peter</HI> was at <HI>Rome.</HI> By this Argument
prove Two Things, and both singular M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣steries
<PB N="123" REF="137"/>
of our Faith. <HI>FIRST,</HI> That <HI>Peter</HI>
was at <HI>Rome,</HI> against those who clatter that
<HI>Peter</HI> was never at <HI>Rome. SECONDLY,</HI>
That if <HI>Peter</HI> met <HI>Christ</HI> bodily, as <HI>Abdias</HI> re∣porteth,
and which I am sure is true, or else
such an Ancient and Holy Father would never
have written it; then consequently, he may
be as well in the Blessed Sacrament as he
was met <HI>Bodily:</HI> To this <HI>Ridley</HI> stood like a
Block, and seeling himself convicted, answer∣ed
nothing. Then, said I, <HI>Cur non respondes,
Heretice, Hereticorum Hereticissime?</HI> Did I not
handle him well? Then he denied the <HI>Minor,</HI>
which I proved thus: <HI>Christ</HI> met <HI>Peter</HI> going
out of <HI>Rome,</HI> and said, <HI>Good Morrow</HI> Peter,
<HI>whither goest thou? Peter</HI> answered, Good Mor∣row,
good Man, whither goest thou? Then
said <HI>Christ,</HI> I go to <HI>Rome</HI> to Suffer. What,
said <HI>Peter,</HI> I trow, unless I take my Marks
amis, ye be <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Good Lord! how do
you? I am right glad I have met you here.
Then said <HI>Christ</HI> to <HI>Peter,</HI> Go back and Suffer,
or else I must, <HI>&amp; pro te, &amp; me.</HI> When <HI>Ridley</HI>
had heard this my Proof, and <HI>Abdias</HI>'s Autho∣rity,
a Doctor Antient and Irrefragable, he
answered never a Word. And thus I con∣futed
<HI>Ridley,</HI> in the Audience of a Thousand;
and yet you say, That <HI>Christ</HI> was never Bodi∣ly
on Earth since the Ascension: Believe with
me, ye be in great Error; let this Argument
of mine Confound you, as it did <HI>Ridely,</HI> your

<P>He would do you no Harm, I hope.</P>

Thing.</P>

<P>That's true; well then, keep it for your own
Instruction.</P>
</SP>

<P>Indeed, Sir, I believe we shall all re∣member
it; and, for my Part, I intend to write
it down, if I can remember it in all its Parti∣culars.</P>

<P>Well, Child, I will write it down for you,

<P>It is certainly a most ridiculous Fable;
is it possible they can impose such Things upon
the People?</P>

falls with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they call him <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor;
or he calls himself so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they have as little Reason for that
as for the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why is he not <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, how can he be <HI>Peter's</HI> Successor, if
<HI>Peter</HI> himself was never there before him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he may pretend to be Successor of St.
<HI>Peter,</HI> as an Apostle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and he does so too, and therefore
exercises an Apostolick Jurisdiction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that, in several publick Acts and
Declarations, which the Pope has pass'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we do not find that the Office of an
Apostle was ever continu'd in the Church, much
less was it made successive; the Appostles consti∣tuted
no Apostles after them, but Pastors and
Teachers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I never heard indeed of any Apo∣stles
after them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor could the Pope succeed St. <HI>Peter</HI> as a
Bishop, because <HI>Peter</HI> not only was not a Bishop
of <HI>Rome,</HI> but was not a Bishop at all; only an
Elder, a Servant, an Apostle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as <HI>Peter</HI> was an Apostle, he could
make a Bishop; does not the Text say, Ordain
Elders in every City, that might be Bishops?</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>

ever <HI>Peter</HI> ordain'd any Elder or Bishop of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>Nay, if they cannot prove that <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>
did so delegate his Power to the Bishop he
so made, I think they do nothing; for 'tis not
enough to say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am sure they can never prove it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see then, how the Pope can be
call'd St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor, if <HI>Peter</HI> never was in
the Place to be succeeded, and that he never de∣legated
<PB N="126" REF="140"/>
his Power to them; yet they will have
it be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will have it be so indeed, but they
make pitiful Work of it, when they go about
the Proof: Father <HI>Plautina,</HI> who is their best
Author, Monsieur <HI>Du Pin,</HI> who is the faithful
Collector of their Ecclesiastick Histories and Hi∣storians,
both affirm, and I doubt not believe what
they say, that <HI>Peter,</HI> some Time before his Death,
consecrated <HI>Clement</HI> (now St. <HI>Clement.</HI>)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But these are Authors of Credit, Sir,
you allow that; and if they were honest Men,
they must be allow'd in Evidence for good Wit∣nesses;
this will go a great Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You urge all that can be said, Child, in
their Behalf; but then when you mention the Law
Part, I mean, that they being allow'd to be ho∣nest
Men, should be receiv'd as good Witnesses,
you should be answer'd as to one Thing, in which
your Argument is defective.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sir, we are no Lawyers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; therefore pray take the An∣swer
in Point of Law; a good Man, that is an
honest Man, whose Character is under no Scan∣dal,
is always a legal Witness; and those being
honest Men, are therefore to be allow'd in Evi∣dence
in this Case: But then you must distinguish
between an honest Evidence testifying of his own
Knowledge, and the same honest Man testifying
by Report, or by <HI>Hear-say.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand that exactly, and I allow it
should be distinguish'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Evidencing, the Distinction should be thus;
in the first they need but affirm only; in the last they
must bring other Evidence; or it is confessing they
want it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="127" REF="141"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very plain. Now, Pray, Sir, do
they bring no Evidence? for I know they could not
be positive Evidences, they could affirm no Fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, they bring no Evidence; nor do they
offer to make Proof of the thing, only barely give
it as a thing undoubted; which is begging the Que∣stion
too, very grossly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's quite wrong, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but they give the Particulars for all
that; and tell us, that when St. <HI>Peter</HI> commended
St. <HI>Clement</HI> to the Chair, and to the Government of
the Church of God, he used these Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very Words, Sir! or only Words to
that Purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the very Numerical Words, the same
and no other, <HI>viz.</HI> 'The same Power of Binding
and Loosing I deliver to thee, which Christ left
me: Do thou, contemning and despising all out∣ward
things, promote, by Prayer and Preaching,
the Salvation of Men, as becomes a good Pastor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was excellent Advice; I doubt, the
Popes since that, have taken but small Care to ob∣serve
the Direction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may talk of that afterwards; and you
will soon see, whether they have follow'd the Di∣rection,
or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, did <HI>Clement</HI> immediately become
Bishop, Sir, upon this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, There the Pretence of the Successi∣on
meets with a terrible <HI>Knock</HI> (as we may say) in
the very Cradle: For, <HI>first, Linus</HI> mounted the
Chair, and was Bishop 11 <HI>Years, 3 Months, 12 Days;</HI>
and next him, one <HI>Cletus</HI> stepp'd in, and sat 12 <HI>Years,</HI>
1 <HI>Month:</HI> And then Persecution making the Chair of
<HI>Rome</HI> a dangerous Seat, and no body to be found to
venture into it, good old St. <HI>Clement,</HI> like a Hero,
and resolv'd to be a Martyr, took it up; so that
St. <HI>Clement</HI> was not Successor to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> but to
<PB N="128" REF="142"/>
<HI>Cletus;</HI> and the Succession had an open Interruption
of four and twenty Years; that's the first Flaw
in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And a very considerable Flaw too, Sir, in my
Opinion, and so St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Exhortation Was wholly
neglected, at least by that <HI>Clement,</HI> 24 Years; and
the Charge of the Church committed to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a small Matter with them. But this is
not all, Child; for this makes not only a Breach in
the Succession, but it makes an Absurdity in the
grand Principle of Popery; namely, the Primacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be pleas'd to explain that Particular, Sir;
for I do not understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Child, the Pope claims to be the
Head of the Catholick Church, as he is the Successor
to St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I understand that well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, if <HI>Clement,</HI> or <HI>Linus</HI> and <HI>Cletus,</HI> or any
other, were admitted Bishops while <HI>Peter</HI> was still
alive; then either St. <HI>Peter</HI> divested himself of the
Authority which Christ gave him, and became subject
to such a visible Head as himself had set up, which
also (by the way) he had no Power to do; or else
there were two visible Heads at the same; time;
which would be absurd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand it all now perfectly: Two
Heads at a time! to one Body too! why, 'tis making
the Church a Monster.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is: And such a Monster as they will not
admit by any means; for this Primacy is their espe∣cial
Favourite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do they say to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Nothing at all; but go on boldly with
the Affirmative; tell us it is so; the Pope is St. <HI>Pe∣ter</HI>'s
Successor, and they are sure of it; and you must
believe it; and the Church has given you her Word
for it; and the Church being infallible, all she
say<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="129" REF="143"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is talking Folks down with great
Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But besides this, Child, they have put this
Very sacred Succession, and the Primacy that at∣tended
it, upon a wrong Foot too; for if St.
<HI>Peter</HI> ordain'd and consecrated St. <HI>Clement,</HI> and gave
him, as is said above, all the Powers that Christ
gave him, (<HI>Peter</HI>) and to him, and such as he
should appoint in his Place; then St. <HI>Clement</HI> should
have appointed his next Successor, in the same
Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And every Successor should have appoint∣ed
another; and so on to the End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; how else can it be call'd a Suc∣cession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has it not been so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it; for, on the contrary, the
Cardinals chose the Popes; and so, as one Au∣thor
says, the Bishops of <HI>Rome</HI> are rather the Suc∣cessors
of <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> than of St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why of <HI>Simon Magus?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the Cardinals have been often divided
into Factions and Parties in their Choice, often
over-aw'd by Power, brib'd by Money, sway'd
by Interest, biass'd by Favours, and, in a Word,
many Ways, I might say every Way, corrupted
in electing a Pope, and giving a Successor to St.
<HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do these Things appear, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>History is full of them, Child; nay, their
own Histories: It would put an End to all the
other, and more needful Part of our Discourses,
to pretend to give you the Particulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it would be very diverting, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall give you frequent Examples of it,
in our other Discourses, as we go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, may we not know a little,
what has been the Consequence of this Way of
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
chusing the Successor by the Cardinals; I mean
the Consequences which have been evil: For other∣wise,
I do not see but St. <HI>Peter</HI> might have ap∣pointed
a Set of ordain'd Bishops to chuse the
Successor, as well as give every single Successor
the Power to ordain another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have said so too, perhaps, if St.
<HI>Peter</HI> had done so; but 'tis evident he did not;
nor do they pretend to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they do not pretend to it, to be sure
he did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Difference first, this is one cer∣tain
Difference, and which could not have hap∣pen'd;
namely, that sometimes the Cardinals have
been so divided into Factions and Parties, that
they have chosen Two or Three, nay, Four Popes
at a Time, and frequently Two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So the Church has been a Monster indeed,
with Three or Four Heads on!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes those Heads have so furioufly
oppos'd and acted against the true Christian Spi∣rit
of a Primitive Bishop, or Head of Christ's
Church, which was to be no Striker, not given
to filthy Lucre, and the like, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 3.
that they have pursu'd one another with Sword,
Fire, and Blood; and have embroil'd, at least,
the whole Christian World in War and Confusion
to support them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This indeed could not have happen'd,
if the preceding Bishop had always ordain'd one
singly to succeed him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, the several Factions of Cardinals,
supported by the several Powers and Princes to
whom they belong'd, have been aw'd or influ∣enc'd
so by the several Interests of those Powers,
that they have not been able to agree in any
Choice at all; and so the Chair has been va∣cant,
<PB N="131" REF="145"/>
and the Church without any visible Head
at all, for several Months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>A living Body without a Head! That's
as bad a Monster as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Monster indeed, every Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, is not this chusing a Succes∣sor
by the Vote of a certain Number of ordain'd
Persons, that are Cardinals, or Bishops, or what
else you please, most like to secure to the Church
a certain Succession of Persons fit for the Dig∣nity,
of truly holy Lives, unspotted Characters,
and fully and fitly qualify'd for the Chair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is pretended; I suppose 'tis one of
the Arguments your Brother brings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, Sir, and therefore I mention it;
for he insists much upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bid him look back upon the History of the
Lives of those holy Persons, and do it but with Im∣partiality,
and bid him tell you impartially what he
thinks of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have had somewhat like that already,
Sir; and he tells us the Chair has been fill'd with a
Set of the most glorious Persons, a Choir of Angelic
Heavenly Bodies, a Heavenly Troop; so many
Saints canoniz'd in Memory of their Miracles; so
many Martyrs and Confessors canoniz'd for the
Remembrance of their Sufferings; so many Cham∣pions
made famous for their steady Defence of the
Church; that no such illustrious Roll can be shew'd
in the whole World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine Flourish truly! but 'tis all a general
Bluster; he did not, I suppose, come to Par∣ticulars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes he did, Sir, at another Discourse,
but they are too many for my Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let me speak to the General then,
first, and I'll come to Particulars afterwards. In
Answer to this, take the Word of a right famous
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>
<HI>English</HI> Author upon this very Head, 'The Popes,
Successors (as they now call themselves) of bles∣sed
St. <HI>Peter,</HI> have been, <HI>says he,</HI> such a ful∣som
Pack, what with Atheists, Blasphemers,
Wizards, Conjurers, Murtherers, Rebels, Trai∣tors,
Adulterers, Whoremasters, Sodomites, Per∣jured,
Lyars, Merciless, Apostate, Avaritious,
Revengers, Raisers of War, and Promoters of
all Kinds of Civil and Religious Strife and Dis∣sention,
that not <HI>Heathen Rome,</HI> with all her
<HI>Caesars,</HI> no not her <HI>Nero's</HI> and <HI>Domitians,</HI> could
ever match them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Author and my new converted Bro∣ther
have strangely differing Notions sure of the
Successors of St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have read the Writings of other dif∣fering
Authors upon the Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And read those Writings too with a dif∣ferent
Taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a great deal in that, Child, I
must own; for the grand Affair of <HI>believing Lyes,</HI>
on which much of Popery depends, is founded in
the Taste of Reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Sir, Prejudices go a great Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But would not do so, if People, read with a
sincere Endeavour to discern real and discernable
Truths; but if they come resolv'd to be, delu∣ded
and impos'd upon, they shall be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is it so in Truth, Sir? Has there
been such a Race of infamous Wretches in the
Papal Chair?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll give you a Lift of a few, Child, that
you may recommend to your Brother to enquire
after them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope they shall be such as are to te
enquir'd of.</P>

<P>Yes, yes, and their own Historians will ac∣knowledge
them.</P>

<P>But, Child, the vile Methods they used

<P>That's true, Sir: Well, then we will ad∣mit

<P>Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> convicted by the Council of <HI>Basil</HI>
of Heresy and Schism; but I will be con∣tent
your Brother shall strike him out; for
<HI>Bellarmine</HI> himself, the <HI>Goliah,</HI> or Champion
of Popery, and of the Popish Church, ac∣knowledges,
in his 4th Book, Chap. 8. that
there have been no less than Porty Popes
accused of Heresy and Error.</P>
<P><HI>Marcellinus</HI> sacrific'd to the Heathen Gods. <HI>Bel∣larmine,</HI>
to excuse him, says, he was not an
Infidel, or an Heretick, and taught nothing
against the Faith, only fell, in that one thing,
and was guilty in the outward Act.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="134" REF="148"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fell, Sir! I thought the Popes never fell;
they are infallible.</P>

<P>You mean, Child, they pretended to be
so; but it seems this Pope fell, and therefore
was not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray go on, Sir, I would not inter∣rupt
your History of Popes; for 'tis very strange,
and very useful to know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I have a long black List for you;
and therefore, giving up those two for petty Fel∣lows,
whose Crimes are not considerable to rank
with those that I have to tell you of;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There's <HI>John</HI> XIII. <HI>Platina,</HI> their own Histo∣rian,
says he had, from his Youth up, been
debauched with all Manner of Vice and
Wickedness; what Time he had to spare
from his Lust, he employed more in sporting
than in praying; and, in a Word, that he
was the most flagitious Rogue that ever was
before him: Pray mark he does not say, <HI>that
ever was after him.</HI> He cut off one Cardinal's
Hand; another's Nose; pull'd out the Eyes
of others; and the Tongues of others; com∣mitted
Incest with both his Sisters; drank
a Health to the Devil, call'd upon the De∣vil
to send him Luck at his Dice; and,
at last, he was taken and stabb'd in the ve∣ry
Act of Adultery. This, I hope, may
pass for <HI>One,</HI> in the List of the <HI>Most Holy
Fathers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Sylvester</HI> II. As <HI>Marcellinus</HI> sacrific'd to Idols,
so <HI>Sylvester</HI> to the Devil. He was a Man
of great Study and Learning, but turn'd it
all to wicked Purposes; and, finally, to Ma∣gick
and Conjuration; and, prompted to it
by Ambition, he sought to Witchcraft and
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>
Sorcery; he obtain'd the Archbishoprick of
<HI>Rhemes,</HI> and then that of <HI>Ravenna,</HI> by the
Assistance of the Devil; and, at last, push∣ing
at the Triple Crown, he obtain'd it
by the Devil's Help too, but upon this ex∣press
Condition, that after his Death he should
be wholly the Devil's: It is true, he is said
to die very penitent; but that this was his
Character, to the very Time of his Death,
<HI>Platina</HI> acknowledges.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Benedict</HI> IX. obtained the Chair by Magick,
that is by dealing with the <HI>Devil.</HI> The same
Author says, that, after a while, he was turned
out, and <HI>Sylvester</HI> III. chosen; but that <HI>Bene∣dict</HI>
got it again, and then sold it; say, sold
the Chair, Infallibility and all, to <HI>Gregory</HI> VI.
After his Death, he walked, as we call it, and
appeared to several, in the Shape of a terrible
Monster. 'Tis also said, that he made Two
of his Fellow <HI>Magicians</HI> Cardinals; and that
they Three used to meet in certain private
Places, and raise the <HI>Devil,</HI> in order to consult
with him for the carrying on the vilest Things,
not fit to mention.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Hildebrand,</HI> or Gregory III. was a Necroman∣cer;
and when Pope, a Fury. He three Times
kindled War in <HI>Germany,</HI> by cursing the Em∣peror
<HI>Henry</HI> IV. and declaring his Subjects ab∣solv'd
from their Allegiance; and was the Cause,
as Historians relate, of the Loss of 300,000
Mens Lives; and thirteen bloody Battles which
were fought on that Occasion: Whence, he
was Sur-named <HI>Hellebrand,</HI> or the Brand of
Hell.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Boniface</HI> VIII. got to be Pope by a Cheat;
causing a Voice to be made thro' a Pipe, to
Pope <HI>Celestine,</HI> a harmless well-meaning Pope,
commanding him, as from Heaven, to quit the
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
Chair; which the poor old Man did, against
the Persuasions of powerful Friends, who would
have supported him; but reply'd, That he
would do what God, who had spoken to him,
would have him.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, that was very honest and pious
in that <HI>Celestine,</HI> was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, but it was a sorry Token of Infallibility,
that he could not tell the Voice of God, from an
Imposture and a Cheat.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>6. John XXIV. had Fifty Articles, containing
almost all manner of Vices, exhibited against
him, to the Council of <HI>Constance;</HI> such as In∣cest,
Fornication, Adultery, Poisoning, and
Atheism, without Piety towards God, or Faith
towards Men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. was a Poisoner, a Murtherer,
an Adulterer, insatiably Avaritious, and, as
one Author, says of him, an <HI>Universal Villain.</HI></ITEM>

<TRAILER>The End of the Fourth <HI>DIALOGUE.</HI></TRAILER>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE V.</HEAD>
<P>THE Discourses which happened between this
good Christian instructing Father, and his
eldest Daughter, and which are mention'd in the last
Dialogue, relished so well, and made such Impres∣sions
upon his Children;that they, as well as him∣self,
were very desirous of having the agreeable
Conferences continued; and therefore, in a few
Days, the Father took Occasion to introduce the
Discourse on another Occasion, which was thus:</P>
<P>Their Brother Frequently brought his Friends, as
he called them, with him to visit his Brothers and
Sisters; and they always observed, that most times
that he did so he endeavour'd to embark those
Friends of his in the Discourses which pass'd be∣tween
the young Family and himfelf But one Time
in particular, his Sister happened to have a Prote∣stant
Minister, and another Gentleman, at Dinner
with them; when he, with one of his Friends,
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
which was, in short, a Priest, tho' he called him a
Doctor of Physick, came to visit them.</P>
<P>After Dinner, he (the Brother) according to his
usual Manner, began to banter and jest with his
Sister upon the old Subject; and she being prepared,
by the Discourses she had had with her Father, be∣gan
to jest with him as fast; and particularly, she,
every now and then, threw a Pope in his Way,
one of the List; and would ask him, how he lik'd
the Picture, till her Brother began to be sick of the
Discourse.</P>
<P>The Protestant Minister smil'd, so did (the Priest)
the Doctor. The Gentleman who came with the
Protestant Minister, was a Man of Learning, and,
as I think, a Professor of Science, in one of the
Colleges at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> but whether in Orders, or
not, I do not remember; but, he was a Man of a
wonderful deal of Wit and Good-humour, had an
extraordinary Fluency of Discourse, and he laugh'd
heartily in Favour of the young Lady, which, at last,
began to turn a little upon the Brother, with a kind
of Admonition, or Caution rather, that he should not
enter too far into that Part of the Cause; that he
would lose Ground by it; and that the Lives of the
Popes would not bear a History.</P>
<P>The young Gentleman saw too well, that he
should not be a Match for his Sister, and that Gen∣tleman
for her Assistance; and particularly, because
the Gentleman had all the Stories of those Things
at his Tongue's End; But he had so much Cunning,
as to embark his Friend, the Priest and that Gentle∣man,
in another Discourse; in which, they disputed
with much Learning on both Sides, and not a lit∣tle
Art on the Priest's Side, who was a Man of
Learning; but had the worst of the Dispute, as he
had, evidently, the worst of the Cause.</P>
<P>However, by this Turn, the Brother had the
happy Advantage of getting the Gentleman off of
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
his Hands, and putting a Stop to his Sister's Satyri∣cal
Turns, about the scandalous Popes; which Dis∣course
had almost put him into a Rage, the Evidence
of the Facts being manifestly against him.</P>
<P>Upon these Particulars being related to the Fa∣ther,
the following Discourse came on, <HI>thus:</HI> After
she had told him, how her Brother shuffled off the Dis∣course
about the Popes, and gave her no Opportu∣nity
to name them, as she intended, she added; And
then, Sir, our Friend Mr.—of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and
his Priest, fell into Discourse; and my Brother, as
it were, listening intirely to them, and seeming
pleased with their being engaged, bid us frequently
observe, this, or that Particular, and so we had no
Room to go on with the Popes.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, you have not given him their Names and
Stories as you intended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, not yet; but he shall certainly
have them, as sure as he has a Christian Name; I
won't abate him one of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did the Gentleman dispute of
pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, the Priest insisted, that the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church was once acknowledged by the Pro∣testants
themselves, to be the most true, ancient,
and only primitive Christian Church; and being
once so, she could not have forfeited that glorious
Title, by any Errors or Malversation of her Mem∣bers;
who, whatever they were, or whatever they
did, in Deviation from the Principles professed, the
Church could not suffer any just Censure, unless
those Deviations were likewise universal and general,
and committed as such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good; then he would have it, that the
Church must be universally Pure, and universally
Corrupt, both at the same Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not understand how you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that the Church professing pure Princi∣ples,
could not be degenerated, tho' all her Mem∣bers
were so; as if the whole Body of Christians, in
the World, were not the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he insisted, that the whole Body was
not degenerated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose the Gentleman could give him an
Account of the great Defection in the <HI>Roman</HI>
Church, from the first Institution; for you say, he
had the History of it by Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and from the first Practice too; he
was very particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he answer to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he demanded an Account when,
and at what Time, those Defections were made; un∣der
whose Government of the Church; and how far
the Church approved, or did not approve, in Case
of any of the particular Deviations, which were
named.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a general Answer ready for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Gentleman had so much of the
History of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church at his Fingers End,
that he answered him almost to every particular
Case locally; he is a Man of wonderful Memory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could the Priest say, there were no Defecations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he did not say that, but he insisted
thus: If those Things, says he, that we defend, and
that you Protestants condemn, be, indeed, Errors
and Innovations, yet they are sprung up in Modern
Time, since the Primitive Days of the Church,
when you acknowledge her to be Pure; so that you
may certainly assign the Times in particular, and
the Persons when, and by whom those Errors and
Innovations were first advanc'd and brought into the
Church; but this you are not able to do; <HI>Ergo,</HI>
they are not Modern Errors and Innovations, but
Primitive Truths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="142" REF="156"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Argument has a great deal of Popish
Subtlety in it, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>I assure you,</HI> Sir, the Gentleman
drove him from it, very handsomely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How, pray?</HI> For if the Priest was a subtle
Disputant, the Gentleman might find it hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why, first,</HI> he denied that such Proof
could not be made; on the contrary, entring into
History, he quoted him Time and Place, I assure
you, for several Things, which I was surpriz'd to
hear, come so readily, in an accidental unstudied
Dispute from a Stranger; but he is well read, that I
must say of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, 'tis a notable Point, how did it go off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, after he had, as I say, rumag'd,
by Story, from one Age to another, and found
him Fathers and Authors for several capital Articles,
he went from them all, thus: But what, <HI>says he,</HI>
if we could not name you Time, and Place, and
Persons, for all the Errors introduc'd into your
Church; it proves nothing but the Knavery of the
Registers and Historians in your Church, who have
razed out of their Registers and Writings, what∣ever
might be found there to their Prejudice; and
even in many Cases, the Registers and Writers them∣selves,
filling their Libraries with false and Legen∣dary
Tales of Things inconsistent and unjust, false
both in Fact and in Chronology.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he give him Examples of any of
these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Abundance; and that, with naming him
the Books, and the very Chapters and Pages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was a wonderful Memory, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that was not all; he told him also,
that, waving all this, he insisted, that his Proposition
was false; and that bringing in a certain Proof of
Time, Place, and Person, was not always practica∣ble,
and, on the other Hand, not always necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="157"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>For that, many Times, said he, Truth
may be forsaken, and Error embraced in its Stead;
and yet, no Certainty left to Posterity of the pre∣cise
Time when it happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and especially is so here, upon
the Foot of the Craft of the Priests, who have, as
it seems he told him, raz'd such Things out of the
ancient Writings, and supprest the Originals, in all
Places where they have had Power in their Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, he offered to enter into the
Proof of the Particulars, with respect to many
more than those which, as I said, he had mention'd
before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He might have done it in many of the most
considerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he insisted also, that it was needless;
that it was sufficient to prove the Error it self, and
that it was an Error, and that it was practised in
the <HI>Roman</HI> Church; which was enough to prove it an
Innovation: no Error being allowed in the Primitive
Times, when the Church was Pure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall add also, what another learned Au∣thor
says of it; that the Errors among them now,
are so notorious, that 'tis fitter to redeem the Time
by amending them, than needless to spend Time
in proving when they were introduced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is certainly true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the Parable of the <HI>Sower,</HI> it was not known
when <HI>the Enemy sowed the Tares,</HI> but, It was evident,
they were sowed; for there they were, and it must
be by an Enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the Business then was to root
them out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and 'tis certain too, that they were
sowed <HI>while Men slept.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="144" REF="158"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, the Gentleman proved, fast
enough upon him, that Errors, and Innovations, and
Inventions of Men, were among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And left him to prove when, and how they
came there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and he had the better of him exceed∣ingly,
in that particular Method.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he come to Particulars then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He offered to do so, in several Cases; but
the other declined it, with all the Artifice imagin∣able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he name any of the Errors, which he
offered to make Proof of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I say, several such (1.) The Image
Worship, or Idol Worship, as he call'd it. (2.)
The Celibacy of their Clergy forbidding to marry.
(3.) The granting Indulgences. (4.) The Monas∣tick
Orders. These he offer'd to prove to be Inno∣vations;
and also to shew him the Time and Per∣sons,
when, and by whom they were brought into
their Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, indeed, he was too hard for the
Priest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he was so; and my Brother saw it,
and therefore came in to his Relief; for he inter∣rupted
them, pass'd some Compliment upon them,
and so put an End to the Battle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did they make any Appointment to meet
again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Gentleman offer'd it, but the otner
pretended he was going out of the Kingdom to Tra∣vel;
I know not whether to <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had no Mind to come to it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>We all thought so, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis their usual Way to shift off Disputes,
when they are over-match'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very sorry for it; for I would fain
have had them gone on, for our own Information.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="145" REF="159"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what, Child? What would you have been
informed of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have been glad to have seen a
little of the History of Error; and how, and when
it was possible such a Multitude of scandalous Things
could be introduced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first, Child, I shall tell you; the Priest
was cunning in beginning to put the Protestant up∣on
the Proof of Things that admit no Proof; but
I will set you to Rights in that, upon Two Founda∣tions.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Many of their Errors may be Historically ac∣counted
for, the Time when, and Persons by
whom they were introduc'd be assigned, and
that's enough to prove the Charge; namely,
that they have been guilty of Innovations.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Others, whose Original and Authors are not to
be found, are to be proved upon them by their
Practice; and so they are lyable to being made
the Authors, even in every Age.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. As it is not possible to come at the Particulars
of some, so it is not necessary, since the Fact,
as above, is prov'd by the subsequent receiving
them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In the Parable of the Sower, 'tis evident, that
Tares were sowed; for the Servants brought the
Husbandman word, that they were sprung up;
What does the good Man infer? An Enemy has
done this; that needs no Proof: The Master of the
Farm did not do it, he would never have sowed
Tares among his own Wheat; it must be a Rogue,
an Enemy: <HI>An Enemy to me, to my Family, to my
House.</HI> This the Husbandman declares.</P>
<P>But here comes the nice Inquirer; Who did it, and
when? what Enemy was it? The Answer is direct,
<HI>viz.</HI> that The Question is impertinent; it was done,
<PB N="146" REF="160"/>
that appeared. The Husbandman did not do it,
that was not rational; as to the Inquiry, <HI>Who?</HI>
The Text says, 'twas done while Men slept; if
they were asleep, how could they see them? And if
they did not see them, how could they produce them,
or tell who they were? If the good Man had known
what Hour, &amp;c. the Thief would have come, or
the Enemy would have come and sown the Tares,
<HI>Matt.</HI> xxiv. 43. he would have watch'd, but he
came unawares.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Story answers them very directly:
Errors like the Tares, were, do doubt, sown in the
Dark, while Men slept, and were not aware of
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Child, the Introduction of Error is
always clandestine; the Nature of the Thing re∣quires
it; it must be so; 'tis a Work of Darkness;
People would not receive such Things in the Light,
with their Eyes open; <HI>in vain is the Not spread in
the Sight of any Bird.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, indeed, 'tis not likely they
should bring in such Things openly, in the Face of
Authority, and of Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, the Doctrine we complain of, is a
Mystery of Iniquity; the whole System of Popery
is a dark Cloud; 'tis a cunningly devised Fable; My∣steries,
you know, are Secrets wrought slowly and
by Degrees, craftily and subtilly, and not easily to
be discovered. The grand Heresies of the <HI>Arians,</HI>
ths <HI>Nestorians,</HI> and others, which I shall name to you
hereafter; the Schemes of <HI>Mabomet</HI> and <HI>Socinus,</HI>
and such as those, were open Violences offer'd to the
Church; like a Rape upon a chaste Virgin, brought
on by Assault, carried on by Force of Arms, and
Terror of Soldiers; innumerable Legions proclaimed
their Doctrines and Dominion, and they knock'd
down all Opposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="147" REF="161"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, that was the Reason that they
converted whole Nations at once; that is to say,
forced them to own their Doctrines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so; the Princes and Leaders of the
barbarous Nations, when, at last, they called them∣selves
Christians, were generally <HI>Arians;</HI> and even
<HI>Constantius,</HI> the Successor of <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, was
an <HI>Asian:</HI> So that Heresy was fix'd by the whole
Power of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, and by the Power of
the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we are upon lesser Errors, which, tho'
they were as fatal to the Chuch, yet did not break
out with Force and Violence as those did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; Popery, like a Chronick Dis∣ease,
began silently and secretly in the Blood, them
getting a Head, spreads like a Gangreen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Cockatrice, it seems, was long a
hatching its Eggs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Romish</HI> Apostacy, is a secret clandestine
Departure from the Faith, stealing insensibly upon
the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>A flow Poison works sure, and a flow
Fever is the hardest to be conquered by Remedies;
it takes Root deep, tho' gradually in the Blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heresy, like Rebellion, is an Enemy bold
and adaucious, shews itself by Insult and Desiance
in the Day-light, and brandishes the Sword in the
Teeth of Opposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Apostacy is a secret Treason, ma∣nagged
by Fraud and Conspiracy, and goes on with
a constant Supply of the same Arts, till it breaks
out in a Flame of general Practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, sometimes private Opinion may have
been broach'd, without any evil Intention, but
by falling into worse Hands, have been carried on to
Extremes, such as have turn'd into avowed pernicious
Errors; and thus petty Innovations have grown up
to monstrous Impositions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="148" REF="162"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came it to pass, that the true
Professors, who always embraced and adhered to
the Truths of Religion, did not openly oppose
those encroaching Errors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that may be accounted for too; such
true Professors there have always been, nor have
they been wanting, even in those Cases, to oppose,
as far as they were able, these Innovations; but they
have generally been over-powered, perhaps, silenc'd
by Force, and so sunk under the Weight, and obliged
to satisfy themselves, mourning in secret.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, perhaps, not thinking themselves
oblig'd to break off from Communion, on Account
of differing Opinions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That fatal Charity has, indeed, done great
Mischief in God's Church, fearing to break off Com∣munion
with the Church, where good Men content∣ing
themselves with not allowing the Corruptions of
Faith, into which she fell, and cleaving to the Truths
which she yet retained, have made the Change of
her Principles rhe less conspicuous, and have helped
to conceal Error by an over-charitable, but really
criminal Silence, at petty Innovations, till they
have grown up to fatal Defections from the Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very plain, Sir, the greatest Fire
bursts out from the smallest Sparks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus for Example:</P>
<P>They that innocently granted St. <HI>Peter</HI> to be

the Pre-eminence to a Pope, on Pretence of be∣ing
his Successor.</P>
<P>They that at first vigorously urg'd Christians to
Acts of Charity and Piety, Distribution of Goods
to the Poor, and the like; little thought that the
Doctrine of Works should be let up equal to Faith

and Means of our Justification and Acceptance with
God.</P>

He that first, for mere Ornament, and for Hi∣storical
Memorandums, to put us in mind of the
good Lives of the Saints and Martyrs eminent in
God's Church, caused their Pictures and Sufferings
to be represented, and hung them up, either in
their Houses or Churches; little thought, that, like
<HI>Gideon's</HI> Ephod, the People should go a whoring
after them; that they should be made a Snare to
them, that the People should worship them in
Breach of the Second Commandment, and that Ido∣latry
should come to be decreed for an Article of
Faith.</P>

<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; and so, I suppose, they who, in
Testimony of the Resurrection, and acknowledg∣ing
the Mercy of God to their departed Friends,
perhaps, wish'd well to their Souls, little thought
it would be run up by the superstitious Monks, to
a Praying for the Dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus, many of the particular Errors of the
Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> sprung up from innocent and in∣ossensive
Beginnings; and which, for want of being
crush'd in their Birth, have come insensibly on,
till they have laid the Foundation of prodigious Ex∣cesses;
and yet the Progress has been so insensibly
slow in its Degrees, that we cannot trace the Begin∣nings
of it.</P>

<P>I'don't think 'tis very material neither, whether
I we can or no.</P>

<P>But besides, there are so many gross Innovati∣ons,
of which we can give a particular Account, as well
the Time when, as the Persons by whom they were
imposed, that there is no Room for them to lay hold
of the pretended Deficiency in the Proof of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are acquainted with the History
of those Things; I wish you would give us some
Account of them in short, for 'tis too long to keep
the whole Tale in our Heads.</P>

<PB N="150" REF="164"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why first, there is the praying to, and wor∣shipping
Saints and Angels; where do ye think they
had it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, from some very devout, and di∣stressed
Creature, that cry'd for Help (in its extreme
Misery) to any one that he thought could hear
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, it came from, the <HI>Devil,</HI> from <HI>Pa∣ganism</HI>
and <HI>Heathen</HI> Rites; and I think, they may
be said to be of the <HI>Devil,</HI> without Offence to any
Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Paganism is <HI>Devil's</HI> Worship, indeed,
in the Perfection of it; but did it come from
them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Saint and Angel Worship among the Pa∣pists,
is nothing more or less than a Piece of <HI>reviv'd
Paganism.</HI> The Pagans had first their <HI>Dii Superi,</HI>
their Gods of the higher Class, or originally so; and
they had the exalted Spirits of their departed Hero's:
And these they worshipped just as the Papists do the
Saints and Martyrs, and pray'd to them as Inter∣cessors
with the superior Deities. Let the Gods be
worshipped, says <HI>Cicero;</HI> as well THOSE of the high
Rank, always Celestial, as THOSE, who, their il∣lustrious
Actions have exalted into Heaven: And in
another Place, <HI>Let the Rites of the Ghost Gods be
kept inviolable, and let them, after Death, be wor∣shipped
as Deities of an inferior Rank.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's Popery exactly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall see it more nicely imitated pre∣sently.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what, Sir? 'Tis not possible to have a
more exact Copy from so known an Original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it may be farther illustrated, by seeing in
what Capacity those Under-Deities were worshipped,
what Use they made of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, as Intercessors with <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
the Father of the Gods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="151" REF="165"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, just as the Papists do with the <HI>Virgin
Mary,</HI> to intercede with her Son. See <HI>Plato,</HI> in his
Book, <HI>in Symposio:</HI> “All Intercousse between the
Gods and Men, is performed by Daemons; they
are the Carriers of Mens Prayers to the Gods,
and they bring back the Rewards of our Devo∣tions
to Mortals.” Again, <HI>Apulcius,</HI> a noted Pa∣gan
Author: “All Things, <HI>says he,</HI> are done by
the Will, Power, and Authority of the Coelestial
Gods; but by the Means, Dispatch, and Admini∣stration
of Daemons.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all Popery again, to the Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Theirs is Pagan <HI>Popery,</HI> and ours is Popish <HI>Pa∣ganism;</HI>
in pursuit of this happy Original, Image-Worship,
and Praying to Saints, have been intro∣duced
into the Church; and 'tis remarkable, that
generally, as it has derived from <HI>Devil</HI> Worship
and Paganism, so it has been handed into the Church
by Hereticks and Innovators; For Example,</P>
<P><HI>Peter Gnaphaeus,</HI> a Schismatick, and an Heretical
Bishop of <HI>Antioch,</HI> in the Fifth Century, first insti∣tuted
the Worship of the Blessed Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> and
as the History of <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> has it, that her Name
should be called upon in the Church: And this, says
a noted Author, was the first Piece of Saint-Wor∣ship
that was ever set up in the Church.</P>
<P>The Extraordinary Flourishes of the learned Ora∣tors
in the earliest Days of Christianity, laying them∣selves
out in their extravagant Praises of the first
Martyrs, and suffering Saints of the Church; whose
Memories, the Christians of those Ages, had in
extreme Veneration; I say, the constant Panegyricks
made on their Faith, their Constancy, their Patience,
recommended their Memory so to the Reverence
and Esteem of the succeeding Ages; that, in short,
it opened the Door to their being, at length, Ido∣lized;
and tho' they were very good Men, that did
thus recommend the Memory of the Saints, as St.
<PB N="152" REF="166"/>
<HI>Jerom</HI> in particular: Yet, the Consequence, which
was unforeseen by them, was fatal; and <HI>Vigilantius,</HI>
in a Treatifs learnedly written on that Occasion,
blames <HI>Jerom</HI> exceedingly for it, on that Account.</P>

<P>It is plain from the Word of God, that
no religious Worship is to be instituted without the

<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard, Sir, that some of those
they have made Saints, and to whom they now pray,
were vile, notorious, black, branded Criminals and

Broachers of Errors and Heresies, Doers of Evil,

worshipped on the first Day of the Year, being the

<P>How can that be? If it be the Day be∣fore
New-Year's Day, it can't be the first Day of

before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>It is no Matter for that, 'tis the first Day of
the New Year, and yet, 'tis the Day before New-Year's
Day too.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that can't be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it can't be, and yet it can be, both to∣gether;
that's Popery for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to be let into the Secret of it, for
'tis all a Mystery to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Case is this, In the ancient Alma∣nacks,
when there was not so many Red-letter Day's
as there are now, the Title of the Almanack was
printed upon the Head of the Leaf in red Letters,
thus, <HI>Kalendarius;</HI> which signified that the Book
was a Kalendar, or, in <HI>English,</HI> an Almanack.</P>
<P>In Process of Time, and the first Almanack-Ma∣ker
being dead long before, the ignorant Printers
omitted the Line, which was usually placed between
<PB N="154" REF="168"/>
the Word <HI>Kalendarius,</HI> and the Head of the Co∣lumn,
and so <HI>Kalendarius</HI> stood just in the Column
above the Word New-Year's-Day.</P>
<P>Ignorance not declining in those early Churches,
there happened some Doubt who this <HI>Kalendarius</HI>
was; but as it could not be questioned, that he was
some great Saint, with whose Worship the New Year
began, the next Year's Printers placed an S before
it, and so in a few Years more, it was received for
Canonical, that this St. <HI>Kalender,</HI> was an ancient,
eminent Servant of God, and that he was received
as such by the Church, tho' his Story was not pre∣served,
or else his Name would have been in that
Manner, in the Front of the Roll of Saints and
Martyrs: And thus, accordingly, the Title of the
Almanack is converted into a Saint, with this Ab∣surdity
added to it, <HI>Viz,</HI> that it makes Two first
Days in <HI>January,</HI> or Two New-Years Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>May I tell my Brother this for a true
Story, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that you may, I assure you; I will un∣dertake
to bring you good Authority for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he won't believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then take another Course; Ask him
to shew you his Almanack; and when you have
look'd it out, ask him who that St. <HI>Calendarius</HI>
was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'll tell me, Sir, 'twas some ancient Fa∣ther,
and, perhaps, a Martyr.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ask him, how he makes out Two New-Year's
Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'll shuffie that off too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why then, tell him the whole Story, Child,
I'll bring you Vouchers for it? whenever you
Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I'll give it him at large, let him
make his best of it: But, Sir, what is this praying
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>
to the Saints? He says, they do not pray to the
Saints, but to them, to pray to God for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well? if that were all, that is making them
Mediators, which is the Office of Christ, and him
alone; but I'll shew you, that they pray to God
and the Saints together, as to Principals; to hear, to
deliver, and to do for them what they want; and
that I may divert you all a little, I'll shew you a
Piece of an old Popish broken English Sermon, or
Homily; which is to be found in a Popish Book,
called, <HI>The Book of Festivals;</HI> and 'tis exactly to
the Purpose, as well to inform you, as to make
you laugh; take it in <HI>Old English,</HI> as we find it.
'Tis appointed for the <HI>Rogation Week.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love those <HI>Old English</HI> Homilies, very
well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must suppose the Parish Priest reading
this Homily; that is to say, preaching it as a Ser∣mon,
the Day that the Boys go a Possessioning, as
we call it, or go on Procession, as they call it; that
is to say, the Three Days before <HI>Holy Thursday.</HI>
The Priest being in his <HI>Rostrum,</HI> or Pulpit, be∣gins
thus:</P>
</SP>
<P>GOOD friends, these three days, that
is to say, Mondaye, Tuesdaye, and
Wednesdaye, ye shall fast and go in
Processyon, man, woman, and servant: for
wee bee all sinners, and none may excuse them
from the Processyon that may lawfully be there.
Than hee that withdraweth himself fro the
Commaundement of holy Chyrche, wilfully,
he synneth full greivously. First, he synneth in
pryde, for hee is unbuxom: Also he synneth in
sloth, that knoweth himself in synn, and will
not do his dyligence to come out thereby; and
ryght as he withdraweth himself fro the holy
Processyon, ryght so wyll God put hym from
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>
all the Company of Heaven, and from all
the Prayers that ben done in holy Chyrch,
till he come to Amendement. Therefore all
Chrysten People come togyder and pray these
thre days to all the Saintes in Heaven to pray
God for us, &amp; put away all the power of the
Fende, &amp; kepe us fro all myschefe, perylles,
&amp; drede that fallen more this tyme of the yere
than any other tyme: For in this tyme fall
many grete Thondres and Lightenyngs. And
as <HI>Lyncolnience</HI> saythe, There were Fendes
that fluttered in the Ayre, for fere of the blaste
of Thonder, when Chryst came to Hell-gates
when hee dispoiled Hell: So yet whan they here
the Thonder in the Ayre, they bee so agast
thereof, that they fall down, and than they go
not upp agayne, tyll they have done some
cursed dede, and make Tempests on the See,
&amp; throw downe Shyppes, &amp; make debate
among folk, &amp; make one to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lee an other, &amp;
kyndle fire to brenne houses, &amp; throw down
steeples &amp; trees, &amp; cause women to over-lye
their Children, &amp; hang &amp; drown themselve in
wanhope &amp; dispayre. Now to put away all
such mischeves and power of the Fende, holy
Chyrche hath ordained, that all Chrysten peo∣ple
shall go on Processyon, &amp; pray to God &amp;
our Lady, and to all the Saints in Heven,
for succour. Wherefore in the Processyons
Belles bee rongen, Baners bee displayed, and
the Cross cometh after: for ryght as a Kynge
when he gooth to a Batayle his Trompetts
go before, than the Baners, &amp; than cometh
the Kinge &amp; his host; soe the Belles bee Goddes
Trompertes, the Baners cometh after, than
cometh the Cross in Chrystes likeness, as King
of Chrysten people. And as a cursed Tyraunt
will bee fore aserde and adradde whan hee
<PB N="157" REF="171"/>
hereth the Trompettes of a Kinge that is his
Enemy, so the fende the tyraunt of Hell, is
aferd &amp; dredeth him sore whan the Belles
rynge, and the Baners ben born, &amp; the
Cross with all the people come, than he
fleeth and dare not abyde, and so the Pro∣cessyon
putteth away his power. We rede
of the Cytie of <HI>Constantine,</HI> as the people went
in Processyon for a Disease that they had got,
as they songe Letany, sodeinly a lytell Chylde
was plucked up into the Ayre &amp; borne into
Heaven, and the Angels taught him to sing
this Song: <HI>Sancte Deus, sancte fortis, sancte
&amp; immortalis, miserere nobis;</HI> this is to saye in
English, Holy God, holy strong God, holy
God that never shall dye, have mercy on us.
And anone hee was let down agayne to the
Erth, &amp; than hee songe that same songe, and
anone they were delyvered of their Disease.
Fro which God delyver us all, &amp; bear us to
blysse. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>This is a merry Piece of Stuff, indeed,

Stuff as this in a Pulpit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Possible, Child! Yes, 'tis possible enough,
for we see them every jot as ridiculous, in the very
Prayers they use to their Saints; and it would fill
a Volume of itself, to give you the Particulars; nay,
it would surfeit you, and make you sick of Popery,

</SP>
<SP>

<PB N="158" REF="172"/>
Time of Pestilence: Good St. <HI>Roch</HI> is called upon,
not only to pray or intercede for them, but to come
to them; tho', I suppose, they would cross them∣selves,
as if the <HI>Devil</HI> was in the Room, if he
was to hear their Prayer, and appear to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Form is this; <HI>O blessed Roch!</HI> You must
observe, the Prayer itself is in <HI>Latin,</HI> and they use it
in <HI>Latin;</HI> but I put it in <HI>English</HI> that you may un∣derstand
it at large; <HI>O blessed R O C H, how magni∣ficent
is thy Name; who by thy Intercession knowest
how to save a Multitude of languishing People, and to
shew thy self propitious to all that commemorate thy
glorious Name? COME, and save us from the
Plague, and grant to us a good Temperature of Air.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They begin with his Intercession only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but you see that's done with, presently,
and he is pray'd to immediately after, in a direct
Manner, as a God; and desired to <HI>COME and
save them;</HI> and, in the mean Time, to <HI>grant them
a good Temperature of Air:</HI> There they make a God
of him; Allow that it is in his Power to heal the
infected Air, and restore it to wholesome Conditi∣on,
and to come down from Heaven; and that it is
in his Power to save them from the Plague; there
<PB N="159" REF="173"/>
is not a Word of interceeding, or praying for them
in all that; no, nor any Reference to it as gone
before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, this is down-right Idolatry, indeed.</P>

out of their Worship, and out of their Ritual and

be prov'd upon them, I mean the Practice of those
foolish Things are to be prov'd; the Extasies, the
Enthusiasm, the Agitations, our <HI>French</HI> Prophets
are Fools to them; nay, <HI>Baal's</HI> Priests leaping upon
their Sacrifices, and cutting themselves with Knives,
don't come up to them: One would almost take
their Excesses that Way, to have something of Ma∣gick
and Conjuration in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I have often thought, there is
Witchcraft in it, and that they deal with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't say, they deal with the <HI>Devil,</HI> but I
verily think the <HI>Devil</HI> deals with them; there is
hardly any Room to doubt it, for there's many Ways
of being impos'd upon by the <HI>Devil,</HI> besides an
actual familiar Converse with him: The <HI>Devil</HI> is a
cunning Fellow in his Business; he deals with us, we
don't deal with him, or at least, when we don't
know we do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, to speak of the Thing itself,
as well as the Manner of it; my Brother insists,
that we may, and ought to pray to Saints and Mar∣tyrs,
and good Spirits departed in God's <HI>Faith</HI> and
<HI>Fear:</HI> He says, he can prove it, both from the Scrip∣ture,
and Practice of all religious People, in all

<P>I know they make great Blusters, as you call
it, upon some Passages in the Scripture; as on God's
commanding <HI>Job's</HI> Friends to go and carry their Sa∣crifices
to <HI>Job,</HI> and that he should offer them up and
pray for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he mentioned that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that amounts to no more than this; that
it was a Praying to God for his Friends, while both
he and they were alive, and in a State of Prayer;
all one as we get Ministers to pray with us, when we
are on sick Beds, or send and request the Prayers of
Fellow-Christians assembled in the Church; which
is nothing at all to the Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, that's quite another Thing,
than praying to them when they are in Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Especially too, when we don't know whether
they are there or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take praying to them, to be worshipping
of them; and we are forbidden to worship any
Thing but God alone; I think they were our Sa∣viour's
Words to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without Doubt, Praying is Worshipping, in
the highest Degree of Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they come off of it, by saying, they
only desire them to pray for us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in saying so, they speak falsely; for their
own Prayers contradict it, as I told you, in the Case
of the praying to St. <HI>Roch:</HI> But suppose that, does
not the Scripture say, there is One God, One Me∣diator?
that is to say, but One Mediator, as but
One God; as if it had said, there is no more a
Multiplicity of Mediators, than of Gods: How
then can they make the Saints departed, to be Me∣diators?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis contrary to the Scripture, that's clear,
I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Child, there is another Difficulty in
the Way; and which, if they cannot remove, then
<PB N="161" REF="175"/>
praying to the Saints is the greatest Absurdity in
Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, supposing the Saints they pray to, are
real Saints, and are really in Heaven, how do they
know, or can they prove from Scripture, that the
Souls of the Blessed, however happy themselves,
have any Knowledge, or can take any Notice of
human Affairs? Which, if they have not, and can∣not,
as is very likely, then how can they know their
Wants, or hear their Petitions? And if the Saints
in Heaven cannot hear them, what Nonsense is it
to put up Petitions to those that can take no Cogni∣zance
of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say, the Saints can hear them; and
I do not doubt, but they believe they can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may so, and believe it too; and that's
as favourable a Thing as you can say of them, in
which they are to be pitied, indeed; but they cannot
prove it, nor have they one Place of Scripture that
makes it probable, much less confirms it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They tell us, <HI>Abraham</HI> heard <HI>Dives</HI> from
Hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but a Parable, Child, and is only a
beautiful Allusion, to let forth the Condition of
lost Souls, in that irrecoverable State; and if it were
Fact, it is a Vision from the same State, tho' in dif∣fering
Particulars, I mean, a State of Eternity; it
is not a praying from this State of Life, to a State of
Eternity; and take it with all the rest, you see <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>
rejects his Petition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; I think that don't help 'em
at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, upon the whole, if it is bur doubtful
whether they can hear us or no, 'tis most absurd,
to pray to them, of whom we are not certain they
can hear us; and there is so much Weight in this,
that the Scripture seems to be particularly careful
<PB N="162" REF="176"/>
to confirm our Faith in that one Thing; that if we
pray to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> he hears us, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 14. <HI>This
is the Confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any
thing according to his Will, he</HI> HEARETH <HI>us.</HI> And
ver. 15. <HI>And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever
we ask, we know that we have the Petitions that we
desired of him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very remarkable; I know there
are many Places to the same Purpose in the Bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be very uncomfortable Praying, even
to God himself, if we were not well assured, that
he both can and would hear us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are no Assurances, as I remember,
that the Saints either can or will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one; you may challenge them to shew
you, where ever any of the Saints, when on Earth,
promised their Followers to intercede for them,
when they came to Heaven, or to hear their Prayers
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, I remember when some of their
People were hang'd here for Treason, and inten∣tional
Murther, the poor ignorant Papists came to
them into <HI>Newgate,</HI> to desire they would pray for
them, when they came to Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they promis'd they would too; and,
perhaps, did not break their Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, Sir, you mean, that they ne∣ver
came there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very doubtful, whether they did or no,
I confess, for they were hang'd for Treason and
Assassination, which they never repented of, nay,
declared themselves not to repent of it; yet the
Papists pray to such as them, to this Day, as Father
<HI>Garnet</HI> for Example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, suppose it was to some Saints, who
we have Reason to believe are in Heaven?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="163" REF="177"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose that, there is not one Word in
Scripture directing us to pray to them, or one
Example of any, that ever did pray to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sure, there is neither Precept or
Example for it in the Scripture; on the contrary,
there are several Texts which tell us, the Saints can∣not
hear us, if they are in Heaven. <HI>Solomon</HI> says,
<HI>Eccl.</HI> ix. 5. <HI>The Dead know nothing at all;</HI> that is to
say, of human Affairs; it must be so understood, or
else we shall run into Soul-sleeping Errors again. <HI>Isa.</HI>
lviii. 16. <HI>Abraham</HI> is said to be <HI>Ignorant of us.</HI> The
best Writers among the Popish Party, have never
yet determined this Case, even to the Satisfaction of
their own Consciences, how the Saints know our
Wants; and they have raised many Cavils about
the Manner, which themselves have not yet answer∣ed.
Blessed be God, Protestants have a more sure
Word of Prophesy; namely, a Way revealed, of
praying to God, in the Name of Christ Jesus, the
only Mediator and Advocate; a Way which God
has commanded, Christ himself recommended, and
both promised to hear and answer us in: What
Need have we of more Intercessors, or of other Ad∣vocates?
What need of praying to Man to intercede,
when the Only begotten Son of God, and, who is
in the Bosom of the Father, has promised to hear
us, and to do for us whatever we ask?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they alledge, the Manner of their
Praying to them, is with a <HI>Salvo</HI> for all this, that
they only pray to them to pray, not to be Media∣tors,
not to intercede.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But let the blasphemous Expressions, and the
blasphemous Titles they use to their Saints, answer
for the Wickedness of the Manner: Take their
Prayers to St. <HI>Cloud,</HI> for one Example: The Words
are thus;
<PB N="164" REF="178"/>

So again, to the <HI>Virgin MARY.</HI>

<P>Dear Sir, don't give us any more, such as
these; 'tis enough to make our Flesh tremble at
Popery; but are these Things true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bid your Brother look in a Popish Prayer-Book,
call'd <HI>Antidot. Animae Pii,</HI> and there he
may help himself to say his Prayers, after this Man∣ner;
with a great many more of the like Kind, to

more, as bad, nay, worse, and more ridiculous than
these; but this is enough for the present.</P>

On the 27th of <HI>July? They pray</HI> to the <HI>Seven
Sleepers;</HI> who, they tell you, went into
a Cave, in the Reign of <HI>Decius</HI> the Emperor,
and slept there to the Reign of <HI>Theodosius;</HI> that
is, 362 Years, and then wak'd all together, to
confute the Hereticks, who, denied the Resur∣rection.
Now, he that believes this Romance,
must be a sleepy-headed Wretch himself: Be∣sides,

the Resurrection could it be, if it had been
true? Since they only wak'd from Sleep, and.
had not been dead.</P>
<P>St. <HI>George,</HI> our Tutelar, is a famous Saint with
them; and they pray to him on the 23d of
<HI>April;</HI> yet they have not one Author of their

<P>On the 21st of <HI>October,</HI> they pray to God, that

Eleven Thousand Virgins; and yet, 'tis Eleven
Thousand to one, but all that improbable Story

every Way.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That <HI>Cornwall,</HI> for thence they came, should

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That Pope <HI>Cyriacus</HI> went with them,

which, upon Examination, was not a living
Saint, but a feign'd Name for the Spear which
wounded Jesus Christ in the Side; but they
pray to him as the Soldier that wounded
Christ with the Spear, which Soldier was a
<HI>Roman</HI> and a <HI>Pagan;</HI> and they have no Rea∣son
at all to believe he was converted; so that
he may be among the cursed Spirits, and it is
most probable he is so; yet they pray to him
to pray for them.</P>
<P>On the 9th of <HI>March,</HI> they celebrate the Memo∣ry

the Words of the Holy Royal Psalmist, speaking
of God himself, and especially of Christ, and turns
and directs them to the Blessed Virgin; for Example,
<HI>Psal.</HI> vii. 1. <HI>O Lord my God, in thee do I put my

<P>Dead! What do they work Miracles
when they are dead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Child, their chiefest Miracles are so wrought,
some by their Bones, their Images, or by the very
naming of their Names; then, the Miracles of the
Host, or consecrated Wafer, of the Crucifix, and
of the Cross it self, are innumerable; the Image of
the Virgin, of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> of St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> and of
a Thousand more, work Miracles every Day in
Imagination: But to make you merry, and surprize
you at the same Time, with the Madness, Blind∣ness,
and Absurdity of these poor deluded People,
called Papists, I'll give you another Homily; 'tis
out of their publick Book of Festivals, and this
particular Homily is appointed for <HI>Corpus Christi</HI>
Day; your Brother may find it in the Book of
Feftivals, Fol. 53. Pray desire him to look for it.</P>

Pity and Mourn over the Blindness of the World, who
are so much given up to those Delusions; but I
fear he is not capable of receiving it with such a
Sense of the Thing: However, be that as it will,
I do not give you any Thing of my own forming,
but can shew it you in Print as publick as any
other of their Church Books: take it Word for
Word as I had it, as follows:</P>
</SP>
<P>IN Devonshyre besyde Exbridge, was a
Woman that lay sick and was nye dede,
and sent after a holy person about mid∣night
to have her Rights. Than this man
<PB N="169" REF="183"/>
in all haste hee might, arose and went to the
Chyrch, and took Goddes body in a Box of
Ivory, and put it into his bosome, and wente
forth towards this Woman. And as he went
through the Forest in a fayre mede that was
his next waye, it happed that his Box fell our
of his bosome to the ground, and he wente
forth and myst it not, and came to this Wo∣man
and herde her Confession. And than he
asked her, yf she wolde bee honseled [<HI>he means
receive the Sacrament</HI>] and shee said, Ye Syr.
Than he put his hande into his bosome and
sought the Box, and whan he founde it not,
he was full sorry and sad, and said, Dame! I will
go after Goddes body, and come agayne anone
to you; and so he wente forth sore wepyinge
for his symplenes. And so as he came to a
Wylowe-tree, he made thereof a rodde, and
stryped himself naked, and bette himself so
that the blode ranne downe by his sydes, and
sayde thus to himself, O thou symple man,
why haste thou lost thy Lord God, thy Maker,
thy Fourmer and Ereatour? And whan he
had thus bette hymself, he dyd on his Clothes
and wente forth, and than he was ware of a
Pyller of fire that lasted from Erth to Heven,
and he was all astonyed thereof, yet he viel∣syd
him, and went to it, and there lay the Sa∣crament
fallen out of the Box into the Grass,
and the Pyller shone as bryght as the Sunne,
and it fasted from Goddes body to Heven; and
all the beestes of the Forest were comen aboute
Goddes body, and stood in Compasse rounde
about it, and all kneeled on four knees, [<HI>how
then did they stand?</HI>] save one Black Horse
that kneeled but on one knee. Than sayd he,
If thou be ony beest that may speke [<HI>pray
mark how discreetly he Catechises him</HI>] I charge
<PB N="170" REF="184"/>
thee in Goddes name here present in fourme
of brede, tell me why thou kneelest but on
one knee: than sayd he, I am a fende of
hel, and wyll not knele and I might, but I
am made ayenst my will, for it is wrytten, that
every knelynge of heven and of erth shall be
to the worship of the Lord God. Why art
thou like a Horse? and he said, To make the
people to stele me, and at such a Town was
one hanged for me, and at such a Town ano∣ther
[<HI>damnable Thieves indeed to steal the Devil</HI>]
Than said the holy person, I command thee
by Goddes fleshe and his blode, that thou go
into wyldernesse, and be there as thou shalt
never dysease Chrysten man more. And than
he went his way, he myght no longer abyde.
And than this man wente forth to the Wo∣man,
and dyd her rytes, by the whyche she
was savyd and wente to everlasting blyss.
To the whiche he brynge us, <HI>&amp;c. Amen.</HI></P>
<P>I will be thankful to any Popish Priest that
shall be able to match this Story, with any thing
equally ridiculous, among <HI>Turks</HI> or Heathens: It re∣ally
grieves me that any that bear the Name of Chri∣stians,
should run into such extravagant Follies, as
the most absurd Religions in the World were never
guilty of.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surpriz'd! Is it possible that the

such simple paltry Stuff as this? Why, it would
make the very Children of our Age mock them,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but that is not all; but, Is it not as
wonderful, that the Priests themselves, who, if there
was any Knowledge among them, might be sup∣oos'd

<P>I can't think, Sir, that the Priests could

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, you must suppose them to be the
greatest Jugglers and Cheats in the World; they
must be Fools, and imposed upon, to believe these
gross and simple Things themselves, or they must be
the greatest Rogues and Villains upon Earth, thus
to delude and blind the Eyes of the People.</P>

<P>Nay, I don't know where it lies; they
may be both for ought I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I believe they were both, indeed; some
were cunning and crafty Knaves, that knew better
than to believe the Things they impos'd upon others;
and some were bred up in horrid Ignorance them∣selves,
and consequently were, as the Scripture says,
<HI>Blind Leaders of the Blind.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir then, before we come to talk
of their Miracles, which I find, by your Discourse,
will be strange ridiculous Things, let us know a lit∣tle
the Ends they drive at in these Miracles, and the
Foundation and Reason of their pretending to
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Child, this will take up a deal of Time,
and force me to puzzle your Heads with History
and Books for a Thousand Things, which your
Memory, perhaps, will hardly retain when you
have found them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know, Sir, you can shorten the
Account, and sum them all up in Stories short, and
to the Purpose, as you us'd to do, and we can re∣tain
it then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why first, then, Child, you are to observe,
that it had been usual almost from the Beginning,
when any Prophet or Messenger of God began to
preach any new Doctrine to the World, to confirm
and support his Mission by some extraordinary Mi∣racle:
It was the Custom of the World, Mankind
expected it; nay, God himself comply'd with the
<PB N="172" REF="186"/>
Temper of Men in that very Particular, when he
sent <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> to King <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> to demand
the Liberty of his People; the Place is very re∣markable.
Where's your Bible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here, Sir; I believe I know the Story
you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Turn to <HI>Exod.</HI> iv. ver. I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read it, Child. Hold there a little <STAGE>[She
reads, <HI>And</HI> Moses <HI>said, But behold they will not be∣lieve
me.</HI>]</STAGE> There you see the Lord gives <HI>Moses</HI> a
Sign, or a Miracle, to work in the Sight of the
People of <HI>Israel</HI> themselves, that they might believe
him. Read again. <STAGE>[Then she reads on thro' the
whole first 8 Verses of the Fourth Chapter.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And God had wrought a Miracle before,
that <HI>Moses</HI> himself might know that it was God that
spoke to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, he did so, by the Fire in the
Bush, burning, but not consuming; and <HI>Moses</HI> did
not question it after this Wonder; nor did the Peo∣ple
question <HI>Moses's</HI> being sent of God, after he
had wrought these Two Miracles in their Sight, as
you may see, Ver. 31. of the same Chapter. Af∣ter
this, God empowers him to do the like, to pre∣vail
upon <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> to believe
him, that is to say, to believe that God sent him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The whole Bible is full of such Things,
Sir; there's the Story of <HI>Elijah,</HI> and the Priests of
<HI>Baal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, 'tis a very remarkable one; for
it brought back the whole Body of the People from
Idolatry, which they were bewitch'd into by <HI>Jezabel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there is the Story of <HI>Hezekiah.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to crown all, even our Saviour himself,
stoop'd so far to the Infirmity of the Times, that he
confirm'd his Doctrine in the same Manner; as the
Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> told the <HI>Jows,</HI> in his Oration, at the
<PB N="173" REF="187"/>
Great Assembly of Apostles at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Acts ii.
22. Turn to the Place, Child, and read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have it here, Sir.</P>
<STAGE>[She reads the Words, <HI>Ye Men of</HI> Israel,
<HI>hear these Words;</HI> Jesus <HI>of</HI> Nazareth, <HI>a
Man approved of</HI> GOD <HI>among you, by Mi∣racles,
and Wonders, and Signs, which</HI>
GOD <HI>did by him in the midst of you, as ye
your selves also know.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>After this, the Apostles did the like in all
the Places where they preach'd, as you may see <HI>Acts</HI>
ii. 43. and <HI>Acts</HI> v. 12. By the Hands of the Apo∣stles,
were many Signs and Wonders wrought before
the People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, we read, Sir, of many of those Signs
and Wonders; as <HI>Peter's</HI> raising a Woman from the
Dead, <HI>Paul</HI>'s throwing off the Viper from his Hand,
<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> healing the Impotent Man, at the
beautiful Gate of the Temple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And abundance more; nay, the Fathers of
the Primitive Church had this Power continued to
them, in some measure, if we may believe the Hi∣stories
of those Time, especially in the Time of the
first Ten Persecutions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I suppose, they were not so fre∣quent
in exerting that Gift as the Apostles were be∣fore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, their Modesty restrain'd them;
but if it were nothing else, their so patiently and
boldly sustaining the Cruelties of their Tormentors,
was as evidently Miraculous as any other of the
Miracles wrought by the Apostles; and 'tis express'd
among the Miracles of Faith in the Catalogue of
them, <HI>Heh. xi. Stopped the Months of Lyons, quenched
the Violence of Fire.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does not that relate particularly to
<HI>Daniel</HI> in the Lyon's Den, and the Three Children
in the Furnace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="174" REF="188"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I should allow it does so it the more
strongly confirms what I say for the Primitive Chri∣stians,
many of them, did the same in the Time
of their Sufferings, the Fire resusing to burn them,
or the wild Beasts to devour them; and that in the'
Fire, when it did burn them, they felt no Pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do read so, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now from these Foundations the Papists be∣gan,
and having false and erroneous Principles to
maintain, a Doctrine of Devils to establish, lying Fa∣bricks
to build, they had recourse to lying Wonders
to enforce them; and this they have done with such
a Front, such an inimitable Assurance, that nothing
can equal it; not the Devil himself ever put so ma∣ny
lying Wonders, and false Miracles, upon the
World, in Three Thousand Years before Popery,
as the Legends of the Papists have furnish'd us
with since the Year 600, or thereabouts, when their
Delusions first took Place: And thus I have brought
down the Reason of their pretending to Mira∣cles,
I hope, to your Understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is easy to understand it, as you have
sum'd it up; but I would fain know how, and by
what Arts they brought the deluded World to believe
them; or, as I might have express'd it, how they
brought the People to be so easily deluded, and
to be imposed upon in such a Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed pretty hard to account for, but
I place most of it to the Account of the Witchcraft
of Enthusiasm; and I take Popery to have more En∣thusiasm
and Agitation in it, than all the Religions
or Sects in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, more than our <HI>John of Leyden's
Muggleton,</HI> or the <HI>French</HI> Prophets! that can ne∣ver
be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I say it over again, more than all of
them, and Five Hundred more such put together,
if you could find them; ay, more than Paganism,
<PB N="175" REF="189"/>
and Mahometism, or Quietism, or whatever you
can think of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is new to me, indeed; I thought
they had Knavery among them, good Store; but
I thought, the Priests had rather acted a Part, and
play'd the <HI>Faux</HI> upon us, than that they had been
really Enthusiasts and possess'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could give you a List of their Enthu∣siasms,
that would amaze you, even their greatest
Saints, and Fathers of their Orders; such as St.
<HI>Francis,</HI> St <HI>Ignatius,</HI> St. <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> St. <HI>Dominick,</HI>
and, in a Word, almost all their Saints, are emi∣nent
for the grossest Pieces of Enthusiasm that are
to be found in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some Stories, Sir, of that Kind would be
very instructing, and would do rarely well with us,
next Time we talk with our Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, your Brother, I think, is a little En∣thusiastick
himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt so, indeed, Sir, else he could ne∣ver
take up with such Mimickry, as he must needs
see among the Papists, and as their Mass and their
Saints Worship, is full of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he never tell you of their Miracles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, Sir, he is mighty full of
them; but he sees we do but laugh at him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be a greater Testimony of En∣thusiasm,
than his embracing the Absurdities of their
Legends; their miraculous Images of the Blessed
Virgin, of the Cross, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you was talking of their Saints,
I had some Opinion of their St. <HI>Francis;</HI> they say,
he was a mighty good Man, and left a great many
sound Exhortations behind him, besides the strict
Rules of a mortify'd Life, which they likewise say,
he practised himself, in an extraordinary Manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was only the greatest Enthusiast that ever
liv'd in the World: The grossest and most inconsistent,
<PB N="176" REF="190"/>
and whimsical of all our Sects in <HI>England,</HI> was al∣ways
far beneath them, and never were able to
match their mysterious Follies. Not the Sweet-Singers,
not the Family of Love, not the Adamites,
that would go naked, the—s, who would eat
nothing but Roots and Vegetables, not the Anabap∣tists
of <HI>Munster;</HI> not <HI>Knipperdolling,</HI> or <HI>Michael
Servet us,</HI> were more blasphemously Wicked, or hor∣ribly
Enthusiastick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray, Sir, give us a Story or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll begin with St. <HI>Francis:</HI> When first
he was converted, as he calls it, and while yet he
was an ignorant Layman, he fell to preaching Re∣pentance,
to the People, in the Streets and Market∣places,
till they, taking him for Lunatick, despis'd
and threw Dirt at him.</P>
</SP>
<P>Being set upon by some Robbers on the Road,
when they ask'd him for his Money, he answers in
the Words of St. <HI>Peter</HI> to the impotent Man, and
smiling upon them, tells him, They should all live
to preach the Gospel. Being then ask'd, Who he
was that durst talk so to them? He answers, <HI>I am
the Preacher, the Messenger of the Great King, font
to go before his Face, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as he had gotten some Followers or Dis∣ciples,
he immediately set up to act like Jesus Christ,
and give them an Ecclesiastick Commission, sending
them forth to preach the Gospel, Go, says he, <HI>and
declare Peace to Men, preaching Repentance for the
Remission of Sins:</HI> Then, having gotten Seven such
as these, he divided the Globe into Four Parts, and
taking One of the Seven to himself, he takes One
Quarter of the World to himself, sending the other
Six, Two and Two together, into the other Three
Parts of the Earth.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a kind of Madness and Phrenzy,
a true Fanaticism; there could be nothing of Re∣ligion
in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="177" REF="191"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that, 'tis what his Disciples
call to this Day, an Inspiration of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Success had it? If it had been
from Heaven, it must have prosper'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that is a Rule to judge by, indeed, it
might be from the Devil, for it came to little; first,
for his own Part, his Quarter of the World, as a∣bove,
being <HI>Asia,</HI> he prepares first to go and preach
to the <HI>Saracens</HI> in <HI>Syria;</HI> but being, by contrary
Winds in the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> driven back to the Mouth
of the <HI>Danuhe,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Servia,</HI> he was
oblig'd to return to <HI>Constantinople</HI> on Foot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he give it over then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he then tells his Disciples, the Spirit
has commanded him to go and convert the <HI>Numi∣dians</HI>
and <HI>Miramolins,</HI> that is, in short, the <HI>Negroes</HI>
of <HI>Africa;</HI> but as this was a terrible long Journey,
and over a frightful dismal Country, full of Lyons
and Tygers, and he was over-fatigu'd with the La∣bour
of it, he falls sick, and narrowly escaping
Death, his Heart fail'd him; which, by the way,
would never have happen'd if his Call had been
from the Holy Ghost; but so it was, that he gave
over that Project.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose he took up some other Design
in the Room of it, perhaps, not so hazardous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but every way as whimsical, for his next
Undertaking was to convert the <HI>Soldan</HI> or Emperor
of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he go on any better with that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he was dissuaded from it much by his
Friends, says his Nephew <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> who writes
his Story, but all in vain; and away he goes, all
in Rags and Barefoot, with only a Loaf of Bread
in his Pouch, to travel over the Desarts, from <HI>Aleppo
to Babylon:</HI> When he comes to the Frontiers, he
yields himself a Prisoner to the Soldiers of the first
Garrison, demanding of them to be carried to <HI>Ba∣bylon,</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="192"/>
for that he had a Message from the King of
Heaven to deliver to the <HI>Soldan.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did they carry him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but not till a great while, and first they
sconrged him soundly, then kept him in Prison,
and almost famish'd him; but he still insisting that
he was sent by the God of Heaven and Earth, to
deliver a Message of glad Tydings to the <HI>Soldan,</HI>
their Emperor, and that his Message was of the
last Importance; and adding, that if their Empe∣ror
should come to understand that they had stopt
an Ambassador coming to his Court, he would be
very much displeas'd: I say, at last they carry'd
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, pray, was he receiv'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Emperor ask'd him, Who he was? and
whence he came? and particularly, What Business he
had with him? that is, with the <HI>Soldan.</HI> He, <HI>Fran∣cis,</HI>
answered, That he was a Servant of the most
High God, and that he was sent to preach Salva∣tion
to him, and to all his People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is much the <HI>Soldan</HI> had not ask'd him,
Why the Great King that sent him could not afford
his Servant better Cloaths?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Soldan</HI> ask'd him, What he meant by
Salvation to be preach'd? Whereupon he explains
to him the Christian Doctrine; and offers, says
<HI>Bonaventura,</HI> (tho' I much question the Truth
of that Part) to go of his own Accord into the
Fire, and be burned, to confirm to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis much the <HI>Soldan</HI> did not take him
at his Word, and try his Courage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he did not, but laugh'd at him, and
the Courtiers having made sufficient Game at him,
the <HI>Soldan</HI> bid 'em turn him out of Doors for a
Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so he had no Success. What did
he make no Converts at all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="179" REF="193"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's no Sign of his being sent by
the Spirit, and inspired from Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, those real Preachers, who were
inspir'd by the Holy Ghost, often converted whole
Cities, nay, whole Nations at a Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis evident 'twas all what you call'd it
before, mere Enthusiasm, tho' I do not well know
what Enthusiasm means, other than that it is a
powerful Self-delusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take one Part of Enthusiasm to be Men mi∣staking
the turbulent Motions of their own Spirits, to
be the immediate Dictates of the Holy Ghost; and
the Tempests of the Brain, to be divine Inspiration;
all which give the Person false Notions of God,
and of Religion, misguide his Zeal, and corrupt his
Devotion; under these Delusions an Excess of
Warmth, and the Desires of Service, run him upon
extravagant Undertakings, as Missions from above;
an Excess in good Desires, he mistakes for a
sacred Perfection; and the grossest Superstition, he
accounts Meritorious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may well be called a Phrenzy, in∣deed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to return to their Favourite, the great
St. <HI>Francis.</HI> He was such a one in all these Ex∣tremes:
Take him particularly in the meritorious
Work of Prayer: He takes it from the Command
that Men <HI>ought always to pray, and not to faint;</HI>
upon this, he undertakes it literally, like a true
Enthusiast, and takes it for no small Merit to pray
continually, if not vocally, yet mentally, without
ceasing.</P>
<P>In doing this, his Writer, <HI>Bonaventura,</HI> tells us,
He us'd to receive great Favours and Caresses from
<HI>the Holy Ghost;</HI> was often ravish'd in his Mind, and
wholly swallow'd up in a certain wonderful Light,
internal and external also; so that oftentimes, in
<PB N="180" REF="194"/>
the Excess of Contemplation, he would be quite
besides himself, in Raptures and Extasies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Oftentimes!</HI> I think, he should have said
<HI>always,</HI> besides himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Insomuch, says the same Author, that being
rapt up in Spirit, as it were in a Third Heaven,
as were the Apostles, and perceiving things beyond
human Sense, he was entirely ignorant of what was
doing before his Eyes. Thus, when he first under∣took
his Mission, he was so taken up with the ex∣alted
Notions of his great Work, that he regarded
no Human Affairs. He chang'd his gay Cloaths
with a Beggar, who he met upon the Road, and
took the Beggar's Rags in their stead, and reading
that our Lord, when he sent out his Disciples, charg'd
them to take neither Staff nor Scrip, he immediate∣ly
put off his Shoes, laid aside his Staff, threw away
his Money, girded himself with a Rope, and went
a Begging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he put the Rope in the wrong
Place, it might have done as well about his Neck.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he would have done the World a
Kindness, indeed, if he had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for his Money, could he not have
given it to the Poor? what need he have thrown it
away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, to such a Degree was his Enthusiasm
gotten up in his Head, that he made it a Piece of
Religion, never to possess any thing, but to beg for
what he wanted, and keep no more of what was
given him, than just that immediate Want required;
and this Rule he left to his Disciples.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do they follow it strictly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They pretend to do it; but if they really
did, How came they by such magnificent Buildings,
such vast Libraries of Books, and such great Tem∣poralities
and Possessions, as they had in this Nation,
<PB N="181" REF="195"/>
and as they still possess in other Nations to this
Day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis all a Trick and Cheat; and, in my
Opinion, 'twas all a Piece of Hypocrisy from the
very Beginning, St. <HI>Francis</HI> and all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say to his being a Hy∣pocrite;
but certainly he was as great an Enthusiast
as ever liv'd in the World; as to Money, I have
told you, he renounc'd it, he abhorr'd it, and thought
himself defil'd if he happen'd to touch it; if he
was invited to Dinner, by any Person of Quality, as
he often was, when an Opinion of his Sanctity be∣gan
to make him famous, he would go, because he
had read that Jesus Christ did so; but before he
went, he would go from Door to Door to beg
some Pieces of dry Bread, and when he came to the
Table of the Persons that invited him, he would
taste nothing that was provided, but pull out his
Pouch, and fall to upon the Scraps he had begg'd,
and eat them, preaching all the while Repentance
and Mortification to the Company; and this Bread
he would call the Bread of Angels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not this part of a <HI>Voluntary Humi∣lity,</HI>
which is condemned by the Apostle? <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 18.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing pleas'd him better than the Thoughts
of being a Martyr; and the Contempt the World
threw upon him, he took for a Species of Martyr∣dom;
wherefore he desir'd nothing more than to be
revil'd and abus'd, and he had enough of it; for in
his own Country, he had, by his extravagant Be∣haviour,
obtain'd the general Character of a Mad∣man,
and seldom was seen in the Streets without a
Rabble of Boys at his Heels, hallooing and flinging
Dirt and Stones at him: This delighted him
so, that, ravish'd with Joy at the very Ignomi∣ny,
he would march as it were in Triumph, blessing
himself, that, as the Disciples of Christ did, he was
thought worthy to suffer Shame for his Name,
<PB N="182" REF="196"/>
<HI>Acts</HI> v. 41. And what think you now, Child?
Have you enough of St. <HI>Francis?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, let us have it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All, Child! they would fill a large Volume; But
they are much the same, look which way you will,
and to what Saint you will; there is scarce One of
all the Red-letter'd Roll, but what, if you will be∣lieve
the Monks, have done some wondrous Mira∣racle,
and that not when living only, but their
Bones, their Images, nay, the very Shrines, where
they have been worshipp'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, they must be Numberless, in∣deed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would think, the Frequency of them
should abate their Solemnity, being seen in so many
Places, and at the Feet of every Image.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. How many Miracles are assign'd
to the Image of the Blessed Virgin, and in how
many Places? Particularly to name but Three, to
which Thousands of Pilgrims daily slock, that is,
<HI>Notre Dame de Mountserat</HI> in <HI>Catalonia; Notre Dame
de Puy,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Auvergne,</HI> in <HI>France; and
Notre Dame de Loretto,</HI> in <HI>Italy?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard a great deal of that <HI>Loretta.</HI></P>

<P>That is it the <HI>Italians</HI> call the <HI>Santa Casa;</HI> Is
it not, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a long Story, <HI>Child,</HI> to tell you;
all the Particulars, would take up a Book by it self;
but the short of the Tale is this: The Words <HI>Santa
Casa are Italian,</HI> and are as much as to say, the Holy
Closet, or Chamber. It is a small Room, about
44 Spans long, and 13 Spans broad, and 23 high;
they tell you 'twas the Room or Chamber in the
House of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> where the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> was born;
where she lodged, and where she was shut in at her
Devotions, when the Angel <HI>Gabriel</HI> appear'd to her
<PB N="183" REF="197"/>
It is made of Cedar, and, as they pretend, was
built by St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, was St. <HI>Luke</HI> a Carpenter then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard he was a Physician, indeed, but
never heard he was a Joyner, or a Carver; but
they can make any thing of him for the Occa∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So here, I suppose, the Virgin receiv'd the
Heavenly Salutation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and not that only, but <HI>here</HI> the Holy
Ghost immediately overshadowed her; <HI>here</HI> she con∣ceiv'd
of <HI>that Holy Thing,</HI> which the Text says,
<HI>Should be born of her;</HI> and to sum up all, <HI>here</HI> she
continued, excepting when she went abroad to vi∣sit
her Cousin <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> till the Time that she
went with <HI>Joseph,</HI> her espoused Husband, towards
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where the Birth of Christ happen'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can this be the Chamber? How
came it hither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that's the First of the Miracles: You are
to understand, that when the <HI>Saracens</HI> began to over∣run
<HI>Judoea,</HI> and that this holy Place could no longer
be preserv'd inviolate, (it seems the <HI>Romans,</HI> tho'
they were <HI>Pagans</HI> as well as the <HI>Saracens,</HI> did not
offer any Violence to it) the <HI>Turks</HI> making all
Places desolate, and this among the other sacred Re∣liques,
being in Danger; the Angels (how many,
the Legends do not agree in, for some say Two,
some Four) took up this <HI>Santa Casa,</HI> or Holy Cham∣ber,
and carrying it from <HI>Nazareth,</HI> in the Air,
out of the Reach of human Power, set it down the
same Day, upon a Hill or Rock, called <HI>Tersatto,</HI> in
<HI>Dalmatia,</HI> near the Sea. This was the 12th of <HI>May,</HI>
1291.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, there might be Four Angels, and
so they held it up by the Four Corners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="184" REF="198"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, perhaps, like spare Bearers to a Cof∣fin,
Two went by its Side to relieve the other, when
they were weary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it may be so, for it was a long Jour∣ney,
indeed, to go in one Day; for it's not less than
Six or Seven Hundred Miles from <HI>Nazareth</HI> to
<HI>Dalmatia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this was not all, for not being satisfied
with the Place, and the <HI>Turks</HI> striving to spread
their Conquests all over that Country, the same An∣gels
took it up again, and carrying it over the <HI>Adria,</HI>
that is, the <HI>Adriatick Sea,</HI> called now, <HI>The Gulph of
Tenice,</HI> they set it down again, at the first Land
they came at, being near the City of <HI>Ancona</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI>
being, perhaps, weary, and not being able to
carry it any farther; or else they would certainly
have carry'd it to <HI>Rome:</HI> Now this is not so much
unlikely compar'd to the rest of the Story, because
they did not like the Place, it seems, any better
than the other; for, in a little Time, they remov'd
it again, and set it down where it now stands, and
where the Virgin, it seems, is not yet thought able
to defend herself by Miracle; and, therefore, the
Place is well satify'd, and a good Garrison always
kept in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, are they afraid the Place should be
carry'd back again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they are afraid it should be plun∣der'd
by the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plunder'd, of what, pray? You said, Sir,
it was only a Piece of a House, a Room or Cham∣ber.
Is there any thing in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>In it Child! Why yes, there is an Altar,
which, they say, was built by the Apostles; and
there's the miraculous Image, as they call it, of the
Blessed Virgin; also there's the Stone, on which St.
<HI>Peter</HI> said the first Mass; all these came over with it,
<PB N="185" REF="199"/>
except the Image of the Virgin, which stands in a
Nich over the Chimney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that, indeed, they may put a great
Value on; but I fancy the <HI>Turks</HI> would not
make much of it; they would do little but kick it
about, and, it may be, burn it: I suppose 'tis a
wooden one, I mean, the Image.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! You don't know what you talk of!
A wooden one! Why, her Cloaths are the Richest in
the World: She is covered over with Diamonds;
she has I know not how many Crowns, set with
Jewels of an immense Value, on her Head; the whole
Room is full of Treasure and Riches, without all
possible Estimation or Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> was very Rich
sure, and her Mother had her House well-surnish'd;
there was some Reason to bring it away from
<HI>Judoea,</HI> to a Place of Safety, if it was so rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake it again, Child, they brought
nothing (except the Altar and the Stone, as above)
but the naked Room, plain and homely; but of in∣estimable
Value, for the Remembrance of the great
Transaction of the Salutation and Conception, men∣tioned
above.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then how came it so Rich now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that brings me to the Point; the in∣numerable
Wonders wrought here, by this miracu∣lous
Image, have brought Millions to the Place: At
the Feast of the Conception and Nativity, all the
Cities and Towns round, are not able to entertain
the Pilgrims and Visitants, who come hither, to pay
their Vows, and make their Oblations; and none
comes empty-handed; Princes and Monarchs send
Presents hither, and send their Petitions to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And she hears them all, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>She never fails to hear and answer all their
Requests, or the Priests make them believe so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="186" REF="200"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose she never fails to receive all the
Presents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No never: One King of <HI>France (Lowis</HI> XIII)
sent her a rich Crown, set with Diamonds, and
with Rubies inestimable; and a little Crown for
her Son, both without Valuation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we have all heard the Story of the
late Popish Reign, when a Present went from hence
to obtain a Pregnancy for the Queen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Song upon it, I suppose, too.</P>
<STAGE>[He repeats some of it.]</STAGE>
<Q><L>As soon as e'er,</L>
<L>The 2ueen of Prayer,</L>
<L>Had got the Diamond Bodkn;</L>
<L>Our 2ueen had Leave,</L>
<L>For to Conceive;</L>
<L>And was not that an odd Thing?</L></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is the Riches, that is got together
there, so very great indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So great, that 'tis past all Description; take
a little part of it thus: First there is the Image, as
above. The Mantle or Robe on it, is covered
with innumerable Jewels, as I have said; besides
which, she has several others, tho' not quite so
rich. The Altar is a Prodigy of Wealth, innume∣rable
Lamps, Statues, Busto's, and other Figures of
massy Gold, are seen about it: Twelve Candlesticks
of Gold weighing Thirty-five Pounds each, and Thir∣ty
eight of Silver, and Vermillion, hang round the
Room. 'The Treasury Chamber, which joins to it, has
Seventeen large Presses, with Folding-doors, each Six
Foot high, in which are laid all the Jewels of Gold,
and all the carv'd Gold, that is presented, to an im∣mense
Value; No Silver being admitted there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="187" REF="201"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is more than our <HI>Thomas a Becket,</HI>
whose Shrine was at <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infinitely more; for as to the rest, it is not
to be guess'd at, there is no End of the Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I have read, that there was more
Gold and Jewels at the Shrine of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> than
Seven Waggons could carry away, drawn by Six
Oxen a Piece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what was all this brought to them
for? what had the People for their Money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa. All Miracles,</SPEAKER>
<P>Child! they came first on
Pilgrimage to the Place; then went up to the Shrine,
which stood beyond the high Altar; there they
kneeled, and made their Prayers to the Saint;
then went and offer'd their Treasure, whatever it
was, laying it upon the Shrine, which is at the Feet
of the Saint, and then kneeled again, and said such
and such Prayers, and went away bless'd; that is
to say, with their Pockets full of Pardons, their
Friends releas'd out of Purgatory, and with other
miraculous Grants obtain'd, such as that above, of the
Bodkin, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were there so many of these Fools,
as they talk of in the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many, Child! why they shew you, in the
Cathedral at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to this Day, where the
Steps up to the Shrine are worn sloping, by the
Multitude of Pilgrims kneeling on them; and they
came not from <HI>England</HI> only, but from all Parts of
the World; and yet this St. <HI>Thomas</HI> was an auda∣cious
turbulent Traytor, and as far from a Saint, I
believe, as any that has dy'd at <HI>Tyburn</HI> this Forty
Years. And so much, I think, may serve for Po∣pish
Miracles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, I think, we have enough of
'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Infatuation of those Times must be very
strong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="188" REF="202"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Mist of Darkness and Ignorance over∣spread
the Christian World, and the Errors of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Church were subtly supported by the
Priests.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Ignorance of the People must be
very gross too; they did not see with their own
Eyes, as we do now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither had they the Light of a Gospel Re∣velation;
the Priests kept the Bible from them, as
a sealed Book; they had not the Blessing of the
Word of God, nor of a Saviour preach'd to them,
as we have; but were given up to strong Delusions,
as the Scripture says, <HI>To believe a Lye.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, it is evident they believ'd Lyes,
if they believ'd such Things as these.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could supply you with a Multitude of such
Examples as these, and some worse, among the Po∣pish
Saints; by which they recommended the vilest
of Men to the Opinion of the People, and made
them pass for Saints, eminent in Humility, Sanctity,
Mortification and Piety, and which took so much
with the deluded People, that even, tho' they ri∣dicul'd
them when alive, their Posterity honour'd
them when dead: But it is an endless Task.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how comes it about, that whereas
their ridiculous Actions made them the Jest and
Laughing-stock of the World when they were alive,
they should be so cry'd up now they are dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the Cheat of Popery: That's the Es∣sence
of Priestcraft; 'tis done by the Length of
Time, and false History; by the Subtlety and Craft
of the insinuating Priests, who falsify'd the Stories,
and mingled Lyes and Fictions among them; so
that, in a Word, 'tis by down-right Forgery, taking
out, on one Hand, much of the ridiculous Part,
and boldly adding miraculous and strange Things,
which were never true in Fact, to represent others,
as the Works of a supernatural Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="189" REF="203"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there Examples of that kind too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Multitudes, and particularly in this fa∣mous,
or rather infamous Life of St. <HI>Francis;</HI> I'll
name you a few, as related by his Kinsman, <HI>Bo∣naventura,</HI>
and others.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That he read Lessons, and preach'd Sermons
to a Lamb, till the Lamb, being illuminated
by his spiritual Influences, kneels reverentially
down in the Time of his officiating, Bleats in
a most humble Manner before the Image of
the Blessed Virgin, and (to the eternal Con∣viction
of all Hereticks) kneels again at the
Elevation of the Host.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Being very Sick, and oblig'd to submit to a
Cauterism or Burning, he thus speaks to the
Fire before the Application, <HI>My Brother</HI> FIRE,
GOD <HI>has created thee beyond all other his Crea∣tures,</HI>
beautiful, chaste and fair, as also <HI>useful
to Mankind; be thou kind and courteous to me in
this Moment of my suffering thee:</HI> Upon which
Address, the Fire is apply'd by the Surgeons,
and effectually cures him, but is not permitted
to burn him with Pain.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is enough, Sir; they that can believe such
Things, may believe any Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take one more, however, of this super-emi∣nent
Saint, you are to understand, that St. <HI>Francis</HI>
was wonderfully haunted by the <HI>Devil,</HI> for the most
holy Men have suffer'd the greatest Assaults of Sa∣tan
in all Ages; but one Time in particular, the
<HI>Devil,</HI> thinking to master his Virtue, throws him∣self
just in St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s way, in the Shape of a
great <HI>Bag of Money,</HI> tempting him to violate his Vow
of Poverty: The Saint discovers the <HI>Devil,</HI> whether
he saw his cloven Foot hang out of the Bag, or by
what other Means I know not, and would not touch
<PB N="190" REF="204"/>
the Money; but bethinks himself of a Project to
shun the Snare, and yet cheat the <HI>Devil</HI> of his Mo∣ney
too; this was not to touch it himself, but
to bid one of his Disciples to take it; first vowing
to build a Chapel and an Oratory with it; but the
<HI>Devil</HI> smells out the Plot, and when the Monk came
to take up the Purse, the <HI>Devil</HI> turn'd himself into
a great Snake, and crept away; upon which, St.
<HI>Francis</HI> made that heavenly Remark, which is called
St. <HI>Francis</HI>'s Maxim to this Day, <HI>viz. That Money
is the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Another Time the <HI>Devil</HI> got into the Saint's Pillow,
tho', by the way, other Accounts make him to sleep
always upon a hard Plank, and not to allow him∣self
a Pillow; but it seems, at this Time, he had a
Pillow, and finding the <HI>Devil</HI> was got into it, he
causes the Pillow to be violently seiz'd upon, and
carry'd to a Necessary Place, where, ripping up one
End of it, he shook the <HI>Devil</HI> out into the Vault,
as if the <HI>Devil</HI> too, who got into the Pillow when
it was whole, could not come out without cutting it
open.</P>
<P>But of all the Impostures of his Life, that of his
<HI>Five Wounds,</HI> in Imitation of Jesus Christ, exceeds
all the rest; yet it is attested by the Legend, and
believ'd by the People, and with that I have done
with St. <HI>Francis.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with all the rest, I hope, Sir; sure
there are no more such, are there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> the Father of the
Jesuits, out-does St. <HI>Franciscus,</HI> if it be possible,
and that both in his Enthusiasms, his Pilgrimages,
his going Naked, his Poverty, his Devotions, and
also his Miracles; they are imitated as exactly as if
St. <HI>Francis</HI> had been the Pattern which he had
vow'd to copy after.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Here Child!</HI> (to avoid repeating them) here
is a Book that has collected them all, 'tis translated
<PB N="191" REF="205"/>
from the Originals of Fathers <HI>Bohours, Bossieurs,
Vitelleschi,</HI> and Two or Three more Popish Authors,
who have written the Life of St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> and 'tis
very faithfully translated, I can assure you.
<STAGE>[Here he gives her a Book, intitul'd, <HI>The
Enthusiasm of the Church of</HI> Rome;
printed in <HI>London,</HI> during the Time of
the late Popish Controversies, in 1688,
a little before the Revolution.]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>May we shew my Brother that Book?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, you need not be ashamed of it, the
Author was a Man of Learning, and of Integrity;
and your Brother may read the Originals if he will,
and see if this Author has done his Two Saints any
wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is what I meant, for I know he will
presently tell me, 'tis all a Forgery, a Falshood,
and a mere Slander upon their Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he does, tell him, you will undertake to
prove the Truth of every Particular in that Book,
from their own Authors and Legends, whose Cre∣dit
he dares not dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, do the Papists pray to such
Saints as those?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, most devoutly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they say they pray only to them to
intercede for them, as we said before: We had
a Battle with my Brother upon that Head, Sir, since
your last Discourse, and he affirms it still, notwith∣standing
the several Homilies you told us by way of
Example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Papists way to deny every thing
with the boldest Face, even in spite of Demonstra∣tion;
Is it not plain that they pray to them perso∣nally,
as in particular I told you where they pray'd
to St. <HI>Roch,</HI> to save them from the Plague, and to
give them a good Temperature of Air?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="192" REF="206"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shuffles it all off with this, that St.
<HI>Roch</HI> was only to pray for it all, for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Dear, I have a Reserve of one
dismal Story more, and if that will not conquer
him, I am satisfy'd it will convince you, and I dare
say all of you, and all that ever you shall shew it
to; and this is the famous Story of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, Who was St. ANN?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Tale is worth your hearing at large; but
I'll give you an Abridgement of it for your Memo∣ry.
This St. <HI>Ann</HI> is said to be the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s
Mother, and by Consequence Grandmother, in the
Line of Nature, to Jesus Christ: By her Holi∣ness,
and most extraordinary Character, they would
assume that the Virgin is immaculate, and born of
so holy a Seed, as that she had no original Cor∣ruption.</P>
<P>Now a certain Female Society in <HI>France,</HI> call'd,
<HI>The Poor Maids of St.</HI> Joseph, take this St. <HI>Ann</HI> for
their Protectress, and tutelar Saint, and build and
dedicate a Chapel to her, recommending them∣selves
and their Chapel to the Queen Regent of
<HI>France,</HI> in a long Address, full of a religious Rhap∣sody
of Expressions, which to us Protestants are,
indeed, most egregious Nonsense.</P>
<P>After this Address to the Queen, follows a short
Treatise, call'd, <HI>The Prerogatives of St.</HI> Ann, where∣in
she is set forth as the Wonder of Wonders
in this World. This Tract is divided into XII
Chapters, containing as follows:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. The Silence of the Evangelists, concerning the
Merits of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The External Perfections of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The First Reason of the Prerogatives of St
<HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. The Second Reason.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="193" REF="207"/>
V. The Obedience of the Virgin to St. <HI>Ann,</HI> being
the Third Reason of her Prerogatives.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. The Glory of Jesus Christ, being the Fourth
Reason, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. The Internal Perfections of St. <HI>Ann.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. Her Prayers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IX. Her Humility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>X. Her generous Confidence in God's Word.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XI. Her Credit and Power in Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>XII. The Imitation of her Virtues.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>After all these fine Things said of St. <HI>Ann,</HI> and
especially all the Flight and Enthusiastic Raptures,
which are found in the particular Discourses upon
every one of the Particulars, the whole is concluded
with the following blasphemous Prayer to St. <HI>Ann,</HI>
of which I need say nothing, but give it you at full
Length.</P>
</SP>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The PRAYER to St. ANN.</HEAD>
<P>“O GREAT SAINT! in <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD's re∣garding

<P>“In Acknowledgement, lastly, of this, that you
were not only of that Family, which Jesus Christ
came to establish upon Earth, but even Mother

as making a Person of this Family:”</P>
<P>“O GLORIOUS SAINT! associate me to this
worthy Family, bend and unite my Soul to Jesus
Christ, and that I may be wholly his, since you
touch him so near, as there is none but MARY

you and the <HI>Author,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Grace,</HI> that
you have Right and Power in <HI>Heaven</HI> to give

<P>“O my Sovereign, next to JESUS and MARY,
give them my Soul; I yield and resign to you all
the Power that I have over myself; I put under
your Government and Protection all the Mo∣ments

that compose my Family, which, hencefor∣ward,
I will call yours.”</P>
<P>“Lastly, my all-dear Mother and Mistress, for
the last Grace I beg of you, that, as you had al∣ways
your Eyes on the divine Face of Jesus
Christ, and your Heart in his, with Burnings
and Flames, which he enkindled within you,
when you had the Honour of kissing and embra∣cing
him; a Time which so continued to increase
each Moment, that at last put a Period to your

of it, you happily, and by an Excess of languish∣ing
Love, expir'd into the Hands of your Daugh∣ter,

<HEAD>DIALOGUE VI.</HEAD>
<P>THE good Father of this young Family, had
thus generally set apart an Hour, or there∣abouts,
every Afternoon, to entertain his Chil∣dren
with useful and instructing Discourses, sui∣table
to their Genius, and calculated sometimes
to divert them, sometimes to instruct them, al∣ways
to improve them: Sometimes he read useful
Books to them of History, Morality, Divinity, as the
Occasion presented; and in particular, sometimes he
<PB N="197" REF="211"/>
explain'd to them the Errors and Heresies, which
troubled the World, and gave them an Account of
the Persecutions which the Church of God had suf∣fer'd
in all Ages, and by whom; and these Two
last Heads necessarily brought him to discourse of
the original Principles of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church;
and then the unhappy Apostacy of his eldest Son
made that Part of his Work the more frequent, as
well as the more necessary.</P>
<P>But you must observe here, that these Discourses
about Popery, were not all together, but the In∣structing
Father was oblig'd, more especially, to
turn his Thoughts to these Things, at some of their
usual Meetings; because of the frequent Attacks,
which his Popish Son made upon the Children, in
his ordinary Conversation with them, in which he
always insinuated one or other of his Popish No∣tions,
in order to wheedle with, and deceive them.</P>
<P>The Children were young, except his Second
Son, who was often from Home, and his eldest
Daughter, who I gave an Account of before. His
Third Son, <HI>James,</HI> who tells you his Brother beat
him, because he told him he pray'd to St. No∣body,
was about Twelve Years old.</P>
<P>Two younger Daughters, one about 11, the other 8
Years old; so that all of them were capable of en∣tertaining
early Notions of the Idolatry and Ab∣surdity
of the Popish Religion, the Frauds of the
Priests, the Pageantry of their Worship, the villain∣ous
Characters of their Popes, and the general
horrid Enthusiasms, Forgeries, and Falshoods, pra∣ctised
by their Saints, Priests, and other Promoters
of Popish Cheats in the World.</P>
<P>As the Father thought this was a proper Time to
inspire his Children with the true Principles of the
Protestant Religion, and form just Ideas in their
Minds, of the Errors and Falshoods of Popery, and
particularly, as I said, their Brother's Insinuations
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
made it more than ordinarily Necessary at that
Time; so he singled out those Points in particular
to talk to them of, as concurred to render Popery
more than ordinarily Ridiculous, and such as suited
best with their Capacities.</P>
<P>He had gone thro' those Heads in particular,
which take up the Three last Dialogues; respecting
the Pope's Succession to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> their Invocation
of the Saints, the scandalous Lives of the Popes,
their lying Miracles, and I have given an Account
of the Chief of their Discourses; but one main
Point remain'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That of buying and selling
the Pardons, and forgiving Sins before they were
committed.</P>
<P>The Children, who had, on all Occasions, been
well instructed in the true Christian and Protestant
Doctrine, been duly and constantly Catechis'd, and
guided to the reading the Scriptures, had all of
them a competent Knowledge of Religion, in Pro∣portion
to their respective Years and Understand∣ings.</P>
<P>But they were amaz'd, and next to frighted,
when their Brother talked to them of having their
Sins pardon'd by the Pope, or by Indulgences,
ganted from his Authority; and that this was drawn
from the Words of Christ himself to St. <HI>Peter,
Matt.</HI> xvi. 19. and again to the rest of his Disciples,
<HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. 18. and especially after his Resurrection,
<HI>John</HI> xx. 23. These things, seemingly drawn from
Scripture, a little startled the Children, till their
Father came to tell them of those grosser and ab∣surd
Parts of Popery; such as pardoning for Money,
pardoning Sins before they were committed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and they were all eager to hear their Father's Opi∣nion
of that Part of Popery.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day, their Brother had talked
very warmly with them, and upon this very Subject,
insisting upon the Pope's Right, as Head of Christ's
<PB N="199" REF="213"/>
Church, to pardon Sins, as the Apostles wrought
Miracles in the Name of Jesus Christ; and as he
had a subtle smooth-tongu'd Priest with him, who
back'd his Discourses, and manag'd the poor Chil∣dren
so, that they hardly knew what to say, their
Recourse was to their Father; and the next Day,
their Father, as was his Custom, being talking to
them, but upon some other Subject, his Daughter
began thus.</P>
<P>Sir, I suppose, you know our Brother was here last
Night, and his Friend with him; and that, accord∣ing
to his usual Custom, he has been, as he calls it,
infusing good Principles into us, in order to make
us good Catholicks; and, indeed, he has run us all
a-ground almost, about the Power of the Pope to
pardon Sins; we all of us wish you would lay aside
your Discourse of other Things for this Time a lit∣tle,
and set us to rights, about that Point; for we
are not able to answer him, and his cunning Friend
the Doctor, (a Priest, we suppose he is) is too
hard for us: Tho' we don't receive his Notions, yet
we hardly know what to say, or how to answer them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it they aim at, Child? What do they
pretend to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, he says, that as Christ said to
his Disciples, <HI>John</HI> xx. 23. <HI>Receive ye the Holy
Ghost, whosesoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted;</HI>
and that the Pope is the Successor to that Prince of
the Apostles, that Power remains in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do they prove it from thence? For
they may as well say, that when Christ breathed
on them, and said, <HI>Receive ye the Holy Ghost,</HI> that
therefore the Pope has receiv'd the Holy Ghost too,
which, considering what a List of profligate Rogues
have been Popes, as I have told you of, would be
almost blasphemous to mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They insist upon it for all that, and that
it is no matter what they were, as Men; they had
<PB N="200" REF="214"/>
the Holy Spirit, and all these Rights and Powers
by Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How will they reconcile it to that Text,
<HI>2 Cor.</HI> vi. 14. What <HI>Communion hath Light with
Darkness?</HI> And to <HI>Psalm</HI> xciv. 20. <HI>Shall the Throne
of Iniquity have Fellowship with thee, which frameth
Mischief by a Law?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then they quote the same Words of
Christ to St. <HI>Peter, Matt.</HI> xvi. 18.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what's that to the Pope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they challenge it for the Pope, as
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, Child, I have convinc'd you, that
they cannot prove the Pope to be St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Suc∣cessor:
But, pray, ask the Doctor, next Time your
Brother brings him, How he will prove, that sup∣posing
Christ gave that Power to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> he gave
him Power to leave it, like an Inheritance, to his
Successors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think of that, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask him, If he told <HI>Peter,</HI> that he gave it him
<HI>to Have and to Hold,</HI> to him and his Heirs for ever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, he will say he did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ask him, Why he did not as well give
him Power, by laying on his Hands, to give the Ho∣ly
Ghost, as St. <HI>Peter</HI> had?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will answer, I doubt not, that he has
that Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then ask him, Why he does not give it to all
the Priests that are taken into Orders, or to every
Body else, when he pleases, as they did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, but he will say, he can do it
if he pleases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He may, indeed, as well say one as t'other;
but he can prove neither of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, about selling those Pardons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; Why did not you ask him, If Christ
gave <HI>Peter</HI> Power to sell those Pardons? And whe∣ther
the Text would not read thus; Whosoever will
<PB N="201" REF="215"/>
pay you for remitting their Sins, they are remitted;
and whosoever hath no Money, their Sins are re∣tain'd?
or thus, Whosesoever Sins you retain, for
want of Money, they are retain'd. This would have
been a little contrary to what Christ bid <HI>John</HI>'s Mes∣sengers
tell their Master, <HI>Matt.</HI> xi. 5. <HI>And the Poor
have the Gospel preach'd to them.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, indeed, will pinch them; but we
could not imagine, Sir, that they sold their Par∣dons:
Why, must no Body have their Sins for∣given,
if they want Money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there are some mighty Pilgrimages,
and Penances, and performings of Worship, to such
and such Saints, visiting such and such Churches,
and the like, to which the Pope is pleased to grant
Pardons in a most extravagant Manner; but we
will talk of that by itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but about this selling Pardons;
I remember, when <HI>Simon,</HI> the Sorcerer, offered the
Apostles Money for Power to give the Holy Ghost,
the Apostle curs'd him heartily for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and do you think, if he had offer'd
him Money for the Power of Binding and Loosing,
Remitting and Retaining, he would not have done
the same?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't question it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray ask the Doctor that Question next Time
you see him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I will, or, at least, I'll ask it my
Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but Christ did not forbid <HI>Peter</HI> to
sell this Power of Remitting and Retaining; and,
therefore, his Successors, the Popes, do sell it; and,
'tis very plain, this very Practice has blown up
their own Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How blown them up, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he that commandeth Light to shine
out of Darkness, brought out of this accursed worst
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
Act of Simony, the greatest Good that ever befel
the Christian World, since the glorious Resurrection
of our Blessed Lord Jesus; I mean, the Reforma∣tion
and Restoration of Gospel Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did that come from this Wickedness,
Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus, <HI>Leo</HI> X. that voluptuous, avarici∣ous,
blasphemous Wretch, of whom I told you,
that he call'd himself <HI>The Lyon of the Tribe of</HI> Judah:
to sent his Emissaries in <HI>Germany,</HI> to raise Money
to support his Bastards, by selling Pardons and In∣dulgences
to the deluded People: The Tools he
sent, rais'd great Sums by this Trade; they rais'd
120,000 Crowns in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> in particular; which
is the poorest Part of all that Country: But in <HI>Saxony,</HI>
they carry'd it on in so shameless a Manner, hag∣gling
and chaffering for the Price, and using such
vile Tricks to delude the People, to part with their
Money, that the <HI>Saxons</HI> grew sick of the Cheat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, they discover'd it themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have read, that they were frequently heard
to boast, how they couzen'd the People of their
Money; but, however, I don't affirm that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not very unlikely. Was it not that
Pope, who, being over-joy'd at seeing so much Mo∣ney
coming in by it, cry'd out, <HI>O! How much do
we gain by this Fable of</HI> JESUS?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, it was the same, and a Mass of
Money was, indeed, gain'd by this selling of Pardons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The People might well be sick of the
Cheat, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Especially when they found it out too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who was it that first discover'd the
Fraud?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the Story I am going to tell; <HI>Martin
Luther</HI> was the Man; He openly preach'd against
them, expos'd the Cheat, and maintain'd the oppo∣site
Doctrine, laying open the Unlawfulness and
<PB N="203" REF="217"/>
Wickedness of this Practice; and there, my Dear,
began the Reformation; but first, let me shew you
this History.</P>
</SP>
<P>In an ancient <HI>English</HI> Book, intitled <HI>The Customs
of</HI> LONDON, there is a Bead-roll of the <HI>Hoole</HI>
Pardons, (so 'tis called) granted by the Popes; and
among the rest, this Story.</P>
<P>THAT, in the Chirch of St. <HI>John La∣tryneus
(I give it in the</HI> Old English, <HI>as it
was written</HI>) Pope <HI>Sylvester</HI> yaf (<HI>that is
gave</HI>) thereto as many yeares Pardon, as it
reyned Drops of Water the Day that Hal∣lowy'd
the Chyrchs; at what Time it reyned
so sore, that no Man had seen a greater Reyne
before that Day: And when he had graunted
this, he thought in himself (<HI>as well he might</HI>)
whedyr he had so much Power or not: Then
there came a Voyce fro Hevyn, and said, <HI>Syl∣vester,</HI>
Thou hast Power enough to yeve that
Pardon; and God graunted (<HI>that's added</HI>)
this much thereto, That, and a Man (<HI>or if a
Man</HI>) had made a Vow to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and
lacked good to doe his Pilgrimage (<HI>that is
Money to pay his Charges</HI>) If he go fro St.
<HI>Peter</HI>'s Chirch to St. <HI>John Latrynes,</HI> he shall
be Discharged and have the Absolucyon of the
Promise.</P>
<P>Blessyd be the Modyr that beareth the Chylde
that heareth Mass on Saturdayes, at St. <HI>John
Latrynes,</HI> for he Delivereth all them that he
Desyreth out of Purgatory, to the Number
of 77 Soules.</P>
<P>There is the Grave that St. <HI>John</HI> lay'd him∣self
in, when he said Mass, and then come a
grete Light over the Grave; and when the
Light was Gone, then find they nooting there
but Hevenly Bred. In that Grave cometh
every Night the holy Cream and Oyl, and
<PB N="204" REF="218"/>
he that putteth therin his Hede, hath a Hun∣dred
Thousand Yere of Pardon.</P>
<STAGE>[But, alas! says the Author that copied this from
the Place, Who should run his Head in a Hole
for such a Business, when 'twas but going to
the High Altar in the same Church, and there
it was set up against the Wall, to whoever said
the appointed Masses there? thus:]</STAGE>
<P>“Ye have Remission of all Synnes, and of all
Penaunces, and INNUMERABLE Pardons, MORE
than any Man NEEDETH for hymselve.”</P>
<P>Likewise, Mr. <HI>Weaver,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Funeral
Monuments,</HI> names a Church, where it is also written
upon the Wall in the Chancel, thus; “If any shall
procure a Mass to be said at this Altar, he shall
have a general Pardon of his Sins; or if it be for
a Soul departed, the same shall immediately be
released out of Purgatory.”</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now what do ye say to this? Is this a sufficient
Proof of their wicked Pretences, or No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think 'tis a terrible Thing; I wonder
any Body that reads the Bible can be a Papist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is strange, indeed, they should; but a blin∣ded
Mind may do any thing, may be brought to any
thing. However, there 'tis for you, Children, you
may call it the Picture of Ignorance and Darkness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Picture indeed! was it possible that such
Ignorance could possess the Minds of the People of
this Nation, I wonder how they came out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Story by it self, and a Story worth
telling too, but it is too long: These very wicked
Doings brought it about; the Reformation broke
in at this Door: This was it that <HI>Luther</HI> preached
first against. I'll tell it you by-and-by. The very
Absurdity opened the Eyes of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="205" REF="219"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, as they carried it to such a Height, it
was not likely the People should bear it long, they
must see into it at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so, the Priests carried it to an extrava∣gant
Height, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was meer Plunder and Robbery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was picking of Pockets indeed, that it
was, and that began the Fray; for the Priests were
never satisfied; first they terrify'd the poor People
to make Confession to them of all their Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then made them give their Money for
Pardons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And give their Estates from their Families,
when they died, to have their Souls pray'd out of
Purgatory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, did they leave Money for it when
they died?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray read <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s Antiquities of <HI>Warwick∣shire,</HI>
and his <HI>Monasticon,</HI> you have them in <HI>English;</HI>
there you will see how many Estates, Lands and
Lordships were given, and Chapels and Oratories
built, as Alms-deeds done, to pray for such and such
Souls out of Purgatory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did the poor Creatures do that had
no Money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were left to shift for themselves; but,
I doubt not, but abundance of Theft and Stealth
was used to get Money to give the Priests for these
Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose they never enquir'd how People
got the Money, so that they did but get it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, it made Wives rob their Husbands,
and Children their Fathers; nay, it made Fathers and
Mothers strip their Families, for who would not rob
and steal to buy themselves out of the Flames?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt they got Peoples Estates away;
I should not wonder at it, when once the People
were Fools enough to believe them.</P>

<P>This puts me in Mind of some merry Lines

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, Pray let us have them for my
Brother, we han't had a Song for him, in all the
Dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, here they are in Writing.</P>
<STAGE>[He gives them to his Daughter, and she
reads them.]</STAGE>
<L>There was an old Woman of Fourscore and Eight,</L>
<L>She went to a Priest to tell her, her Fate;</L>
<L>She gave him Two Crowns, and bad him instruct her</L>
<L>What to do, when to Heaven's Gate Death should con∣duct
her.</L>
<L>The Priest took her Money and told her, St. <HI>Peter,</HI></L>
<L>With the Keys at his Girdle, should certainly meet her;</L>
<L>Prepar'd to unlock them, according to Sentence,</L>
<L>If she was but furnish'd with Faith and Repentance.</L>
<L>But, quoth the good Wife, Is there no other Way?</L>
<L>For, of Faith or Repentance, I've little to say.</L>
<L><HI>Ay, ay,</HI> says the Priest, Leave the Church your Estate,</L>
<L>And 'tis all one to <HI>Peter,</HI> He'll open the Gate.</L>
<L>It is so! <HI>quoth my Dame,</HI> then I'll e'en take my Fate,</L>
<L>For I'll never pay Toll, 'till I come to the Gate.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, let me have a Copy too, in Writing,
for another Popish Friend of mine, I'll read them
to him too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take them among you: [<HI>He gives him the
Verses in Writing.</HI>] But, pray, What does he say to
these Pardons? Does he never talk of that to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, indeed, heard such Things; but
never could think 'twas possible, that the People
could be so blind to think the Pope can forgive
their Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="207" REF="221"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and for Money too, <HI>and that for who bids
most,</HI> as if Pardons were sold by <HI>Auction,</HI> or by
<HI>Inch</HI> of <HI>Candle.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, is not the Scripture plain, <HI>Can any
one forgive Sins,</HI> BUT GOD ONLY? <HI>Matt.</HI> ii. 7. Nay,
it is spoken of as blasphemous for any Man to pro∣nounce
Forgiveness to another, Ver. 6.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the Pope can grant Pardons for many
Years to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, can he forgive Sins before they
are committed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and give License for the committing
them too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish, Sir, you would state this Case to
us too, and make it as plain as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will so, and every jott as absurd and ridi∣culous;
and I'll give you Evidence too of every
thing as I go along.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if it can be made out by Proofs, it
must be more ridiculous, if that be possible. What!
Man to give a License to sin against God! Sure,
our Brother will never pretend to justify such a
Thing as that.</P>
<P>Here one of his little Daughter spoke: Sister,
<HI>says she,</HI> you know he told us, the Pope was in
GOD's stead upon Earth; for he was CHRIST's
(I think 'twas) VICAR, he call'd him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>my Dear,</HI> they pretend he is Christ's
Vicar, and Head of the Church; and that Christ
hath given to him his full Power, as you heard
your Sister say just now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Did Christ himself ever forgive
Sins before they were committed? I don't find that
in my Bible; but it may be, my Brother has ano∣ther
Bible; I think, they say, he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or rather, my Dear, he has no Bible at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, let 'em have what Bible
they will, Do they pretend, that ever Christ said to
<PB N="208" REF="222"/>
any Body, <HI>Your Sins,</HI> for To-morrow, <HI>are for∣given?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very natural, indeed, <HI>my Dear,</HI> no∣thing
can be more absurd.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Then another Child spoke, who was not above
Eight Years old.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, says she, Did ever Christ say
to any Body, <HI>Go</HI> and <HI>Sin on</HI> for <HI>a whole Year,</HI> and
<HI>it shall be forgiven?</HI>
<STAGE>[Then the youngest Son, a Youth of about
Twelve Years old, being looking all this while
in his Bible, had found out several Places,
and folded them down, which his Father
perceiving, spoke to him thus, What are you
looking for, <HI>James?</HI>]</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have found some Places, Sir, where 'tis
spoken of that Christ forgave Sins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, have you found any, where he
forgave Sins before they were committed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, where he said to any, you may go
and sin again for a Year or Two, or Three, and
it shall be forgiven you, as your little Sister here
has it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's it I was looking for; I have found
where he says to them several Times, <HI>Go and Sin no
more,</HI> first to the Man that was heal'd at the Pool,
<HI>John</HI> v. 14. and then to the Woman taken in Adul∣tery,
<HI>John</HI> viii. 14. Here they are.</P>
<STAGE>[He gives her the Bible to read, and she reads
both the Texts.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, are you sure that the Papists
do pretend that the Pope can forgive Sins before∣hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or can give a License to Sin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Proof enough, Children, and not
for the Pope alone, but the Priests by Deputation
from him; pray read that Paper, and read it
to one another at you Leisure. Here it is, 'tis a
<PB N="209" REF="223"/>
Notable one, I assure you, and you may shew it
your Catholick Brother too, if you find Occasion.</P>
<STAGE>[He gives them the Paper of St. <HI>John Latery∣neus:</HI>
It was a Chapel of St. <HI>John,</HI> which
stood much about the Place, where St. <HI>Mar∣tin
Vintry</HI> Church stands, or in that Part
of the City of <HI>London.</HI>]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I know my Brother pretends
the Pope can forgive Sins, but I don't know for how
long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he told me, he would bring a
Man to me, that should give me a Pardon for <HI>Lying;</HI>
and I am sure, I had not told a Lye <HI>to him,</HI> I re∣member
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and he has said a many wheedling
Things to me about Pardons, but I can't remember
them now, nor I did not much mind them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been endeavouring to poison
all the House; he has preach'd Popery to the little
Children that could hardly speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, he has been in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Stead; he
has endeavoured to tempt and to seduce you all; but,
I am persuaded, he shall have no Success, his Reli∣gion
is so ridiculous, that the least Child I have
will see through it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, we do but laugh at him, Sir;
especially, ever since you told us so many black
Stories about their Popes, which he calls Holy Fa∣thers;
I think he should say Holy <HI>Devils.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>I made him so angry with the Story of pray∣ing
to St. <HI>Almanack,</HI> that he took up his Cane and
beat me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, poor <HI>Jemmy</HI> has suffered
Persecution already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, did he beat thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, I told him he pray'd to St. No-body;
for that St. <HI>Kalendarius</HI> was No-body, just as you
told us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="210" REF="224"/>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I anger'd him worse, for I told him
he pray'd to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did'n't he beat thee too, Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but he did worse, for he spit at
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Child, he spit in her Face, and
call'd her <HI>Devil;</HI> and told her, he did not pray to
her. She came crying to us so, that I thought he had
done something or other to her, to fright her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must forbid him coming to the House; I
won't have you insulted so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, we don't value it, 'tis only when
we laugh at him about his Religion, and laugh at
the Pope, then he is out of Patience; I am per∣suaded
he will be wiser still; he will come to see the
Folly of Popery some time or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure he knows better, and has been
taught better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Absurdity of these Things will shock
his Reason; certainly, he can never shut his Eyes
against the Truth, at least not long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say to that; Popery is
a strong Delusion, and the Scripture tells us of some
that were given up to strong Delusions, that they
might believe a Lye, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> ii. 11.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But such Lyes as these, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, such as these, Child, the Scripture lets
you see who does it, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 4. <HI>The God of this
World has blinded their Minds;</HI> 'tis all from the <HI>De∣vil,
the God of this World.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think nothing but the <HI>Devil</HI> could
do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him so; I told him he was gone from
Christ to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and that he worshipped the
<HI>Devil;</HI> for he pray'd to such Wretches, instead of
Saints, that I was sure was in Hell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, did not he beat you for that too,
Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="211" REF="225"/>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas all together, Sir, at the same Time; I
told him, his Two Saints, St. <HI>Francis,</HI> and St. <HI>Igna∣tius</HI>
were <HI>Devils,</HI> were gone to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and made
<HI>Devils</HI> like himself, and that when he pray'd to
them, he pray'd to the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you are a bold little Fellow, to talk so
to your Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>I be'n't afraid of him, Sir, as long as I know
'tis true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he say to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>He made Crosses upon his Face and his Sto∣mach,
and mumbled somewhat to himself, I don't
know what, and so did the Man that was with him (a
Priest they say he is) and after that, because I
laugh'd at the Pope, he call'd me impudent Boy,
and would have beat me again, but the Doctor
would not let him; the Priest I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll prevent that, I'll have no more
fighting among you; let him talk no more of his
Fopperies, if he can't bear to be contradicted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ja.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't care for it, Sir, I have talked as much
to him since that, but he don't beat me any more;
he never offer'd it since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I'll warn him the House, and then we
shall have no more of it; if he can't be civil to his
own Brothers and Sisters, let him stay away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, don't do that, then he'll say
you were afraid left he should convert us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pervert you, I suppose, you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, so I do; but you need not
fear us, we are always too hard for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it looks as if you were too hard for
him, he is so angry; for People never fall into a
Passion, but when they are worsted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let him come, Sir, I am persuaded
his Eyes will be open'd some Time or other, he
will be quite of another Mind.</P>

<P>I pray God he may.</P>
</SP>

<PB N="212" REF="226"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, about that other way of granting
Pardons for Pilgrimages, and visiting Churches, and
such Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I can give you such a monstrous Ac∣count
of those Things, 'twill amaze you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, all you have said upon that Sub∣ject,
has been amazing; I believe, we are all a∣maz'd
at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall only quote you a few Passages, but
they shall be from such Authorities, as your Brother
shall not be able to deny; and first take a short Hi∣story
of Fact to bring them in: In the Year 1688.
during the famous Controversy about Popery, Fa∣ther
<HI>Pulton,</HI> a Jesuit, wrote a Book, call'd, <HI>Good
Advice to the Pulpits,</HI> in which he taxes the Church
of <HI>England</HI> Ministers with making unjust Reflections
upon the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in their Sermons.</P>
<P>Among the rest, he falls upon Dr. <HI>Tennison,</HI> after∣wards
Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for saying, in a
Sermon, That the Pope has <HI>oftentimes</HI> granted his
Bulls for Indulgence, for many Years Sins unre∣pented
of; and that <HI>it is a common Practice;</HI> which
the Jesuit denies to be true, and demands of the
Doctor, Who those Popes were?</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Tennison</HI> answer'd this Book, and tells the Je∣suit,
that he has falsify'd his Words; that instead of
<HI>oftentimes,</HI> he only said <HI>sometimes;</HI> and for its being
a Common Practice, he did not say it at all: But
in order to shew how near he had been to the Truth,
if he had said so, he gives several Accounts of the
Facts, as Evidences, and some of those Accounts
will make good what I am to explain to you about
Popish Pardons, for Services perform'd, as above.
The first Instance is thus:</P>
<P>THESE Three prayers be wrytten in the
Chappell of the Holy Crosse in <HI>Rome,</HI>
otherwise in <HI>Latin,</HI> called <HI>Sacellum sanctae Crucis
<PB N="213" REF="227"/>

shall obteyne Ten hundred thousand of yers
of pardon for <HI>DEEDLY SYNNES</HI> graunted of
our holy Father <HI>Jhon XXII.</HI> Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<P>Sir, this is a sufficient Voucher, indeed:
we will desire my Brother to read it; but I dare
say he will be in too much Passion to read it over;
perhaps, he won't look on it; but 'tis all one, we
will read it for him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I give it you to convince you all, and
confirm you in your own Principles, and to shew
you what a wretched Religion this is, that they
would bring you over to, and how ill it is to be de∣fended.</P>
</SP>
<P>I could go on to load them with just Reproach,
for such unsufferable Things, as cannot be read
without some Horror; but we have not room
to talk of all their Points, they are too many;
such as:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Celibacy of their Priests forbidding them
to marry, and yet at the same Time licensing
them to keep Whores.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Affirming and teaching, that it is not so great a
Sin for a Priest to have a Concubine, as to be
marry'd to a Wife; so that, in short, there is
more Care taken that the Clergy shall live
<HI>single,</HI> than that they shall live <HI>honest.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For the Punishment of either of these, the
first being absolutely forbidden, cannot be com∣pounded
for; for if a Clergyman marries a
Wife, he is instantly depriv'd; but if he only
keeps a Concubine he is fin'd Seven Grosses,
that is about Ten Shillings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Their praying in <HI>Latin,</HI> or in an unknown
Tongue; they tell us, that such as pray in <HI>La∣tin,</HI>
tho' they understand not what they say,
may pray with as great Devotion, and often∣times
more, than those that pray in a Lan∣guage
which they understand.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That good Works of justify'd Persons are not
so the Gift of God, but that they do truly
merit an Increase of Grace now, and Glory
hereafter.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="220" REF="234"/>
6. As to Confession of Sin, 'tis an Article in their
Catechism: “That tho' a Sinner be not af∣fected
with such a Grief for his Sin, as may
be sufficient for Pardon; yet when he has
rightly confess'd to a Priest, all his Sins are
pardon'd; and by the Power of the Pope's
Keys, an Absolution and Entrance is open'd
into Heaven.”</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That bare repeating or saying over the Prayers
without minding, or so much as knowing what
they say, is sufficient and acceptable to God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. Many of their Saints are canoniz'd for dete∣stable
Villanies, Treason, and Blood, and yet
they pray to them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. That they pretend only to use Images as Helps
to Devotion; but on the contrary, they
actually pray to them to pardon their Sins.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. They pray to a Crucifix, as well as to Christ
himself, and attribute as much Satisfaction to
it, as to the Blood of their Redeemer.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>If I had Time, I could prove all these by abun∣dant
Witnesses▪ and undeniable.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, the last is a terrible Article; are you
sure it can be prov'd? I would be very glad to
have that Head to shew my Brother, for he pretends
all those Things are only to raise Devotion, and
that they only pray to Jesus Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they do so, Child; but the Matter of
Fact is otherwise; let them look into the Office for
the Consecration of a Cross, if your Brother is not
ashamed of it, let him look at the Consecration of a
Crucifix; the Bishop prays thus, <HI>That GOD would
bless the Wood of the Cross, that it may be a saving
Remedy to Mankind, a Steadfastness of Faith, an In∣crease
of good Works, the Redemption of Souls,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="221" REF="235"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this is monstrous, indeed! this makes
the Cross their Saviour, not Christ, or as much as
Christ; but does not our Saviour say, <HI>Which is
greater the Altar or the Gift?</HI> Mat. xxiii. 19. And
may not we say here, Which is greater, the Cross or
the blessed Saviour, who was crucified upon it, and
who has given Dignity to the Cross? I will not
say sanctified it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides that, in their Office for the Adora∣tion
of the Cross, it is evident, the Priest holds up
the Cross, supposing it to be the true Cross, or a Piece
of it, that Christ really was crucified upon; and he
uncovers it, and says to the People, <HI>Behold the
Wood of the Cross.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>The People answer aloud, Let us draw near and
worship it; and then they all kneel down: and this
he does three Times.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>As for its being the true Cross, I suppose,
they can't believe that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they are persuaded to believe it is in so
many Places, that 'tis thought, if all the Pieces were
put together, they would load Two or Three Wag∣gons
with Six Horses apiece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is wretched Work; why they wor∣ship
the Wood, supposing it to be the Wood of the
Cross, whether it be so or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and when that Wood must have been
rotten and gone, a Thousand Year ago, at least; not
all the Art in the World could have preserv'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose 'tis the same with their other
Reliques.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Monstrously ridiculous! some of them so no∣torious,
that their own People are, oftentimes
ashamed of 'em. I'll name you a few.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>'s Milk, so many Drops of it are
preserved here and there, at the several Churches

there are Pailfuls of it in all. At <HI>Hall,</HI> in the

Thread, which she work'd with, when she made the
seamless Coat that Christ had on.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Occasion had she of Needle and
Thread, if there was never a Seam in it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, <HI>my Dear,</HI> there have been many deluded

I would have you all remember, <HI>viz.</HI> there have been
whole Nations brought over from Popery, to em∣brace
the true Protestant Religion, which is the truly
Catholick Faith, even in the Popish Sense of the
Word; but there never was any one Nation brought
back from the Protestant Doctrine to embrace Pope∣ry
again; no, not one in the World.</P>

<P>No, Child, the People have been driven
away, murdered, and destroyed, and those that
have been turn'd, are so by Force; but 'tis one
Thing to turn the Principles of a Nation, and 'tis
another Thing to banish and extirpate the People.
The Reformation was wrought, as the Christian Re∣ligion
was first planted, by Preaching the Gospel, not
by Fighting and Blood. St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and
the rest of the blessed Apostles, planted the Christian
Faith in the World; <HI>Luther, Calvin,</HI> and the rest of
the Reformers, planted the Reformation, and all by
the same Way, <HI>viz.</HI> By the <HI>Foolishness of Preaching;</HI>
the Holy Spirit gloriously concurring: Paganism, at∣tempted
<HI>the First</HI> by Lyons, Racks, Fire and Tor∣ture:
The Papists attempted <HI>the Last</HI> by Armies and
Cruisadoes, that is, by the Sword, and by Fire and
Faggot, by the Gallies and the Inquisition; and both
have succeeded alike; as no one Nation, once made
Christians, were ever brought back to Paganism; so
no one Nation, once made Protestants, were ever
(calmly and peaceably) brought back to Popery.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="7">
<PB N="224" REF="238"/>
<HEAD>DIALOGUE VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE Brother had now run his Length: he
had been a hasty Convert to Popery; and, as
such often are, was become a mighty Bigot, eaten
up with Superstition and Ceremony, and, which was
still worse, tho' he was not in Orders, took upon
him to be a kind of a Missionary, for the Conver∣sion
of his Friends, preaching Popery to them
where-ever he came.</P>
<P>This Zeal carry'd him even to Indecencies in his
Father's Family; As to his Father himself, he treat∣ed
him with a kind of Distinction, as he was a Fa∣ther;
and, indeed, because his Father was a Man
of Spirit, as well as Sense, who kept him at a due
Distance, and would not take any Appearance of
Disrespect at his Hand, without Resentment; main∣taining
his just Authority in his Family, and either
would be convers'd with as he ought to be, or not
be convers'd with at all.</P>
<P>But in the Family, and among his Brothers and
Sisters, which, as I hinted at the Beginning, were
numerous, he was quite another Man, and therein,
indeed, he did not act like a true Missionary, sent
to preach Religion to Infidels; whose Business it is,
with all possible Softness, Mildness and good Usage,
to insinuate themselves into the Favour and good
Opinion of the People.</P>
<P>But, on the contrary, more like a Cruisado Man,
he besieg'd them with Power, and assaulted them with
Violence, assum'd an Authority in his Discourse,
<PB N="225" REF="239"/>
as being the elder Brother, and as he call'd himself
Head of the Family, next to his Father, who he
treated among them with Slight and an Indifference
bordering upon Contempt.</P>
<P>In this Quality, he pretended to expect his
Words should come with the greater Force, and ex∣pected
Things should be taken as Truth, upon the
Sanction of his Authority; and being impatient of
Contradiction, would fly out into a Passion, if what
he said was not receiv'd with Respect; and thus
he frequently took upon him to be angry, and
talk impertinently to his eldest Sister, and even to
correct, his little Brother for being saucy to him, as
he call'd it, and telling him he pray'd to St. No∣body;
and at another Time, his younger Sister
telling him, a little too pertly, that he pray'd to
the <HI>Devil,</HI> he sent her away crying, and spit in
her Face.</P>
<P>But the Father was too many for him; for tho'
he knew that his Son came frequently among them,
and that he always lay at them to pervert them,
if possible, and infuse corrupt Principles into their
Minds; yet trusting to the Grace and Goodness of
God, and the early Influence which all his little
Houshold had receiv'd, he would not forbid their
conversing with him, or restrain his coming to
them.</P>
<P>At the same Time he fail'd not every Day to
fortify their Minds against Error, by solid Argu∣ments,
sound Reasonings, and practical Inferences,
all back'd and supported by Scripture Authority,
laying such solid Foundations of Truth and Reli∣gion,
as all his Sophistry, no nor all the Subtlety
of the Priest, which he frequently brought with
him, could never shake; and yet this he did, in so
suitable a Manner, with such agreeable pleasing
Discourses, and diverting Stories, proportion'd to
the Understandings of his Children, and to their
<PB N="226" REF="240"/>
Youth, that in short, made them not only able to dis∣pute
with their Brother, but to run him down, and
even make a Jest of him, and of his Religion too.</P>
<P>His eldest Sister, who his Father chiefly directed
his Discourses to, was a young Lady of a great
deal of Vivacity, had a sprightly Wit, a good
Judgment above her Years, and a capacious vast
Memory, so that nothing was lost that her Father
said to her, nor did it want any of the Spirit and
Force, which the Father express'd it with. On the
contrary, she rather whetted and sharpen'd the
Edge of it, by the ready Turns of her own Saty∣rical
Wit, and was often evidently too hard for
him in Argument, as well from the Goodness of
the Reasoning itself, which was from her Father, as
from the particular Art she had of placing every
Thing right in her Discourse, and pushing him
home where she had the Advantage; and this was the
Reason that he was so frequently angry, and once in a
Passion, he told her, she was disobliging, and did not
treat him as became her, and the like; an evident
Token of his being exhausted in Argument.</P>
<P>The last Two or Three Discourses they had, such
as that about praying to Saints, to Images, and
adoring Reliques of Saints, adoring the Cross,
and even Pieces of Wood, which they had Rea∣son
to believe was not the true Cross, and praying
to Crucifixes, and to the Figure of the Cross where∣ever
they met with it; had made him very angry:
but when his Sister came to the Point of their buy∣ing
and selling of Pardons and Indulgences, and
especially that of the Pope giving Pardons for Sins
before they were committed, and for Thousands
of Years to come, seemed to shock him a little,
and once or twice he stood silent, shook his Head,
and then turned his Discourse to something else,
so that all his Sisters took Notice of it, and remem∣ber'd
it afterwards, as we shall hear.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="241"/>
But we must bring this new Convert a little far∣ther
on, where we shall see him acting another Part,
at least something more Rational.</P>
<P>As the Father of this Family had thus, I say, for∣tify'd
his Children, and especially his Daughter,
with Arguments, in answer to all the Points which
he knew their Brother and his Priest would make
use of, to deceive and impose upon them; he
made them really an Over-match for their Brother,
and he could argue upon no Point of Religion, and
especially in his Popish way, but they were mani∣festly
too hard for him.</P>
<P>Of all the Popish Tenets, which he defended,
they press'd him hardest with those Two:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Praying to Saints immediately, and in their
own Persons, to save and deliver them;
whereas, he affirm'd, they only pray'd to
them to intercede with Christ for them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Buying and selling Pardons, and that for
Sins before they were committed, and for
many Years to come.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>He was not able to defend either of these Points,
and he was a Man of too much Sense not to know it,
and therefore, as much as he could, he shunn'd med∣dling
with them; but his Sister, sharp as Satyr it∣self,
and keen and cutting in her Repartees, hung
upon them, and when he had gone off to some
other Discourse, would jest with him, call him back,
and say, Brother! Brother! keep to the Point;
and particularly she held him so hard to it, about
praying to Saints, in their own Names, (as above)
that he grew angry, and, in his Passion, told her
she <HI>Lyed.</HI></P>
<P>The young Lady, with admirable Spirit, keeping
her Temper, though it rais'd some Blood in her
Face, suffer'd it to raise none in her Discourse;
<PB N="228" REF="242"/>
but she rises up, and, with Smiles in her Face,
made him a Curt'sey; “I'm answer'd, Brother,
says she; I thank GOD you are conquered, you
have no more to say; for giving the Lye is the
End of all Discourse.” And with that she walked
gently and calmly out of the Room.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, who he call'd Doctor, and who
they suppos'd to be the Priest, was with him, as he
generally was, and he greatly blam'd him, and fol∣low'd
the young Lady out, intending to persuade
her to come back; but she was gone up into her
Chamber, where, tho' she had govern'd her Tem∣per
so well before, she could not refrain giving some
Vent to her Passions, and cry'd heartily for some
Time.</P>
<P>However, to be even with her Brother, the next
Time he came, and began to discourse of Reli∣gion,
she told him calmly, that she could not but
remember how they left off last, and that she
would have no more Popery talk'd of, till those two
Points were gone thro'.</P>
<P>Her Brother was milder than before, and told
her, he did not design to have been so plain with
her; but that she took upon her to affirm Things,
which she could not prove.</P>
<P>She expected he was going to ask her Pardon,
for giving her the Lye; but being disappointed in
that, she began to be a little warm herself, and told
him, she would not give him such Language, but
that he should see presently, whether he deserv'd it
or no; and with that she pulls out the Paper, which
her Father had given her, with the Prayer to St.
<HI>Ann,</HI> which, she said, was Blasphemous, and bid
him get off of it if he could.</P>
<P>He colour'd and blush'd, as red as Flesh and Blood
could look, all the while he read it, and, at last,
throws it away in a Passion, and said it was a false
Thing, and that it was a Heretick Forgery.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="243"/>
No, no, Brother, says she, the Protestants stand
in need of no Forgeries, to confound Popery, 'tis
done out of your own Mouths, and with that she
pull'd out the Certificate of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI>
and shew'd it him, both in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Then she pull'd out more Papers, and particular∣ly
that which is mention'd above, to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI>
to give good Weather, and take away the Plague;
and with the rest, she had the Documents of the
Pope's Bull, for granting Ten Hundred Thousand
Years of Pardon, mentioned before, and she told
him, she had them to shew.</P>
<P>But he was so confounded with the Certificate of
the <HI>Sorbonne,</HI> in Favour of that blasphemous Prayer
to St. <HI>Ann,</HI> that he said not one Word, but give
the Paper to the Doctor, who also read it, and laid
it down without saying any thing to it.</P>
<P>The Doctor was a Man of Temper, and had a
perfect Command of himself; and seeing the young
Gentleman so confounded and silent, he endeavoured
to put an End to the Discourses; and turning to the
young Lady, told her, He was sorry to see these
Discourses always put them out of Temper, and
broke in upon their Kindness: That he wish'd they
would rather converse upon some other Subject,
that might not disorder or discompose them.</P>
<P>The Sister answered, With all her Heart; That
her Brother always attack'd them first; That they
were bound to defend their Principles, and thank'd
GOD they were able to do it; That her Brother had
used her very ill when he was there before, in tel∣ling
her she ly'd, and had as good as told her so
again now, in telling her she brought a Heretick
Forgery to him: That as she expected little less from
him, so she was not to be blamed for bringing such
good Vouchers for what she had said.</P>
<P>That now having cleared her self, she left it to him,
or even her Brother himself, to reflect on whose
<PB N="230" REF="244"/>
Side the Falshood lay, and who had spoken Truth,
himself or his Sister; That now she was satisfied, and
if her Brother thought fit, she would advise him to
leave off talking of Religion, till he could defend it
better, and not be baffled by Children.</P>
<P>Her Brother was going to answer, but the Doctor
seeing him mov'd, and fearing that he would be
rude to his Sister, stood up, and spoke in <HI>Italian</HI> to
him, and begg'd him to say nothing at that Time,
and so persuaded him to go away: so the Conversa∣tion
entirely broke up, and it was the last they had up∣on
these Subjects; nor did he come near the Family
after it for a Month, 'till other Particulars brought
them to converse upon better Terms.</P>
<P>Some Time after this, the Brother, by some Ac∣cident,
I do not remember the Particulars, had the
Misfortune to break his Leg; and though it was set
again immediately, yet, he lay a long while, not only
lame, but in great Danger of a Mortification.</P>
<P>During his long Confinement, his Sister, laying
aside all the Resentment that had been between 'em,
went to visit him. The first Time she came, and
being in the beginning of his Illness, he could say
little to her, nor had she any Room to say any thing
to him, his Fever being very high; for the Hurt be∣ing
what the Surgeons call a Compound Fracture,
that is, where the broken Bone had thrust itself out
through the Flesh, the Pain of it had thrown him
into a Fever.</P>
<P>However, he spoke to her, and desired her to
come nearer; and putting out his Hand to her, she
gave him her Hand, and he holding it fast, ask'd
her Pardon for his Passion, and ill-using her; adding
some Expressions that seem'd to let her know,
he had had Leisure to think a little better of those
Things, since she saw him last.</P>
<P>What he said was so moving, tho' but in few
Words, that, together with the dangerous Condition
<PB N="231" REF="245"/>
she thought he was in, it threw her into Tears, and
she could give him very little Answer, and he per∣ceived
it, so he said no more, and she came away
for that Time. But when she came home, and as
soon as she could get an Opportunity to see her Fa∣ther,
she told him where she had been; upon which,
they had the following short Discourse.</P>

too; he is exceeding bad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry for it, I pray God open his
Eyes, before Death comes upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, won't you be pleased to go and see
him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he does not desire it; Did he speak
of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't say he spoke of it; but that
might be, because his Fever is so strong upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would go to see him, if I was able to do
him any Good; but I shall not refrain my speaking
to him of his Condition, and of his Apostacy: I
should think I failed in my Duty, if I did not; and,
perhaps, that might do him Hurt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope it might do him Good, Sir, and
not Hurt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean, Child, it might do him Hurt as to
his Distemper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, Sir, you would not speak to him
in any Anger, at such a Time as this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, not in the least; I am grieved, but
not angry, tho' he behaved very rudely to me; but
I know how to be a Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="232" REF="246"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am persuaded, Sir, if he dies, he will
never die a Papist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If his Fever increases, he will soon be past
telling, or even knowing what Religion he dies of;
a Death-bed is no Place to change Principles in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard you, Sir, say, very often,
that a Death-bed was what would bring People to
themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Child, so it does; 'tis a Time when Con∣science
is set at Liberty; but it often carries them off
before they have Time to hear it speak, except it be
in Terror and Confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a Time, I believe, for opening Peo∣ples
Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a sad opening of one's Eyes, Child, when
they open and shut, both in a Day; nay, perhaps,
both in an Hour.</P>
</SP>
<Q>When Vengeance and Conviction come together.</Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, my Brother has not the Vengeance
upon him; But I fully believe he has the Conviction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Reason have you for it, Child? Had you
any Talk with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very little, Sir; He could not talk much,
and I could not talk at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a poor Comforter, that go to visit a
sick Man, and can't speak to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>To see the Condition he is in, Sir, 'tis ve∣ry
terrible; and to see all the Popish Trinkets that
he has about him too, was as terrible as all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should that be terrible to you, <HI>my
Dear?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, to think a poor Wretch should
have them brought to him, to comfort him at such
a Time as that: I should think they brought the
<HI>Devil</HI> to me; I am sure I should as soon have them
bring the <HI>Devil;</HI> I should know what I had to do
<PB N="233" REF="247"/>
when he came, but I can't imagine what can be
done with those Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, Child, what Things are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first, Sir, he has got a Popish
Nurse, who fits up with him, and she has pinn'd up
I know not how many Holy Reliques, as she calls
them, about the Curtains; and upon the Table,
there is a little Silver Box, which is full of them.</P>
</SP>
<P>The old Woman sits by the Bed's-side in a great
Chair, and there hang Two or Three Strings of
Beads; and at the Back of the Chair, she has pinn'd
up I know not how many Crosses; they are only Bits
of red Tape and black Tape, I suppose they are to
keep the <HI>Devil</HI> off her dear Self, when she sits
down.</P>
<P>Over the Chair, by the Bed-side, hangs a large
Picture of the Crucifixion; and a great Crucifix of
Wood, or Ivory gilded, hangs against the Bed's∣head,
just over him, and another at the Bed's∣feet.</P>
<P>But while I was there, he bad them take it away;
Let me have Christ, says he aloud, without the
Cross, Christ without the Cross, repeating it aloud;
and, I thought, with some Passion: I am persuaded,
Sir, he is sick of Popery.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how can that be, when he has all this
Trumpery about him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does not see them, Sir, only the Cru∣cifix,
and he could bear it no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was not his Doctor with him, Child, that
used to be his Companion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, and I believe has not; for I
heard the old Woman whispering to the Maid, who
is a Popish Wench too, that her Master had quar∣relled
with his Confessor, and she was afraid he
would die without being confess'd, and bad her send
for Father (Somebody) I could not hear his
Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="234" REF="248"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, do they believe he will die?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe they do, Sir, but I must say,
I hope they are mistaken; if the Surgeons are but
Men of Skill, I hope, his Fever will go off again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can have no Patience to see him with all that
Idolatry about him: I would have you go again,
Child, but I shall but do him Hurt, for I must speak
my Mind plainly, as I think is my Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he desires to see you, Sir, I hope you
will go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, if he will rid the Place of all his Po∣pery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't answer for that, Sir; but if you
would have me say so, Sir, I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not have you say any Thing to trou∣ble
him, while he is in this Condition neither; and
if he does not speak of my coming, or desire me to
come, you need not mention it; but if he does,
you will have fair Occasion.</P>
</SP>
<P>To make this Part short; she went Two or Three
Days after that, to see him again; but he was so
ill, and the Surgeons were about him so, that she
could not see him. she stay'd some Time; but the
Surgeons desired that No-body should see him,
especially not to talk to him, but that he should go to
sleep, if possible, to compose him; for they greatly
feared a Mortification.</P>
<P>His Sister was surprized a little, to find that he
had changed his Nurse, and that the Popish Maid-Servant
also, was gone all of a sudden; and the new
Nurse (who, she spoke to, it seems) took particu∣lar
Care to let her understand, that she was a Pro∣testant,
which his Sister was very glad of.</P>
<P>The next Morning, her Brother being told she
had been there the Night before, sent his Servant
to tell his Sister, he had rested pretty well that Night
<PB N="235" REF="249"/>
after the Dressing; and that he would be glad to see
her, excusing his not seeing her over Night.</P>
<P>This over Civility to his Sister, join'd with her
Observation of the Popish Nurse being gone, made
her begin to think something extraordinary was the
Matter; and her Curiosity was increased by some
Words which the Messenger added to one of her
Servants in the House (<HI>viz.</HI>) That there were
strange Alterations at their House; so she hastened
away.</P>
<P>When she came thither, she found her Brother
much better than she expected; his Pain was much
less since the opening of his Leg, and his Fever was
abated, tho' not quite gone; but, however, it was
gone out of his Head, and he was also much more
chearful than before.</P>
<P>When she ask'd him how he did, he told her, He
was quite well; as well as ever he was in his Life,
and better too.</P>
<P>She was a little frighted at that; and feeling by his
Pulse, that he was still hot, and in a Fever, she
concluded he talk'd light-headed, and that he was
in a worse Condition than before; upon which, she
could not refrain Tears.</P>
<P>He perceived her Tears, but did not guess at the
Occasion; and continuing to speak chearfully to her,
he wondred, a little, that she did not seem pleased;
and he said, What's the Matter, Sister, are you not
pleased to find me better?</P>
<P>Dear Brother, <HI>says she,</HI> How can you ask me such
a Question? If I was sure you was better, I should
rejoyce.</P>
<P>How do you mean? Don't you think then that I
am better? Why, first of all, I am easy; the Sur∣geons
have loosen'd the Bandage upon my Leg,
which made it swell and inflame, and put me to a
continued Torture, and now I am easy; and then
<PB N="236" REF="250"/>
he gave her an Account of what they had done,
and how much Danger he was in before.</P>
<P>This Discourse was so sedate and so distinct, that
she begun to be satisfied; and having said something,
by which he perceived what had alarm'd her before,
he pull'd her to him, and kiss'd her, and said, Dear
Sister, I am not light-headed, or delirious; and I
shall soon convince you of that, <HI>adds he:</HI> Do you
see no Alteration in the House?</P>
<P>Yes, says she, I perceive you have parted with
your old Nurse that you had, when I was here
before.</P>
<P>Ay, Sister, and with all her Trinkets: Dear Si∣ster,
adds he, she is gone, and a worse Attendant
with her; I have pack'd her off, and all my Popery
along with her; blessed be God, they are all gone,
I have done with them.</P>
<P>His Sister was going to answer, but was so sur∣priz'd,
she could not speak; only, that she said,
<HI>Have you?</HI> And burst out into Tears, much more
violently by the Force of her Joy, than she had
done before for Grief.</P>
<P>But her Brother seeing it, kiss'd her again, and
holding her by the Hand, went on: Dear Sister,
said he, don't weep; now I am sure your Tears are
of another Kind than they were before; I am not
light-headed, I knew what I said, when I told you I
was well; I am well! I am better than ever I was in
my Life! for tho' my Leg is broken, and my Fever
is strong, my Heart is turn'd; God has open'd my
Eyes, Sister.</P>
<P>She could not speak a Word yet; her Tears and
her secret Joy choak'd her Words, and she made good
that Verse of the Poet,</P>
<P>That sudden Joys, like Griefs, confound at first.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="251"/>
Look about you, Sister, <HI>says he,</HI> I ask'd you, if
you perceived no Alteration in the House? Don't
you see all the Popish Trade is walk'd off? They are
gone, Sister, with all their Trinkets; blessed be
God, I have parted with the Idols, and with the
Idolatry too.</P>
<P>Upon this, she turned her self a little, and began
to look about her; and she presently found, that
the Crucifix was gone from the Bed's-head; the
great Picture that hung over the Chair, was taken
down, and all the Reliques that hung about the
Curtains, were gone.</P>
<P>By this time, she recover'd her Speech a little;
and the Nurse came and gave her a Glass of Wine
and Water, which she call'd for, and when she had
drank it, her Brother said,</P>
<P><HI>Dear Sister,</HI> You have been a kind Instructor to
me, tho' I have us'd you very ill for it; but live or
die, I will acknowledge it to you.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Brother,</HI> says she, I am so surpriz'd with Joy,
with all you say, that I hardly know whether I am
awake, or whether it is all a Vision, a Delusion, and
whether I am not light-headed, as I thought you
were. I am not able to tell you how it affects me;
but, in a Word, I rejoice beyond expressing, I de∣sire
to be thankful for you.</P>
<P>Ay, says he, let us all be thankful; it's no Vision,
Sister, nor Delusion; no, no, I have done with
Delusion, and the Deluders are fled, they are gone
together; the Night, the Darkness is fled, and the
Light has shin'd into my Soul: Dear Sister, 'tis all
owing, next to God's Goodness, to you, and your
kind affectionate Discourses.</P>
<P>He talk'd so much, and with such Vehemence,
that it began to weaken him; and the new Nurse,
that now tended him, a good elderly grave Woman,
and a good Christian and Protestant, desir'd him
not to talk so much, and so warmly: And his Sister
<PB N="238" REF="252"/>
added, Come Brother, says she, tho' I long to hear
the full History of it, yet I'll wait till another
Time.</P>
<P>Well, says he, I must have done for the present;
so he bid the Nurse give his Sister an Account of
Things: And, first, she shewed her the Elbow Chair,
where all the Crosses had been pinn'd up, and they
were all gone; the Silver Box of Reliques also, was
gone, and the several Popish Pictures were all
gone. Three Popish Books, a Psalter, call'd
<HI>the Virgin</HI> Mary's <HI>Psalter;</HI> another, call'd, <HI>The Hours
of the blessed Virgin,</HI> and a Mass-Book, he had made
them be thrown in the Fire before his Face, and
there lay some of the Remains of 'em half burnt.</P>
<P>While they were doing this, her Brother, a little
spent with Talking, fell fast asleep; and she took the
Opportunity to ask the Nurse, how all this happen'd.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, says Nurse, my Master was so
very ill, and the Pain in his Leg was so great, that
every Body thought he would have died; but that
which was worse, it was plain to us all, for I was in
the House, said she, that he was more violently
agitated in his Mind, and in greater Agonies there,
than with all the other Pains he endured.</P>
<P>That old Sorceress, <HI>said Nurse, I can call her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>less,</HI>
mumbled over her <HI>Latin</HI> Prayers by him, made
Crosses upon him, and held up her little Crucifix <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
him; but he thrust it from him, and bad away with
her Trash, that would do him no good; at which,
she was very angry. She had hung all the Curtain▪
with little Bits of Wood, and Bone, and Ivory, and
such Trumpery, as she call'd Holy; but he knew
nothing of that.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> he might see them.
If he did, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> he did not mind 'em.
How came he to see them at last, <HI>says his Sister?</HI>
Why, Madam, says she, my Master grew worse
and worse, and the old Witch had sat up with him
<PB N="239" REF="253"/>
Two Nights; all which Time, she had worry'd and
teiz'd him to send for his Confessor, and to have
the <HI>Extreme Unction:</HI> she call'd it by another Name
of her own, I don't know what; but he would not
hear of it, and told her he was not in such Danger.</P>
<P>But, at last, she teiz'd him so much, that it made
him angry; and he told her, hastily, he would have
none of it, 'twould do him no good, or 'twas
good for nothing to him, or to that Purpose; so she
left off, but was highly provok'd; and the next
Morning she had sent for a Priest without his
Knowledge.</P>
<P>When the Priest came into the Room, he was in
a great Passion at the Sight of him; and, Madam,
says Nurse, those Things did my Master a great deal
of Harm, and made him worse than he would be;
however, he govern'd his Passion, and spoke civilly
to the Priest, and told him, He could not, at that
Time, discourse; that he was in Pain, but, he hop'd it
would abate, when they opened his Leg, and that he
was just endeavouring to go to Rest; but that, when
he was a little refresh'd, and able to see him, he
would send for him; and with this, he dismiss'd the
old Priest, and he went quietly away, only gave him
his Popish Blessing as he went.</P>
<P>Then he did not say over any of his Mumbles to
him, did he? <HI>says the Sister.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> it was plain, my Master
did not care for them.</P>
<P>But, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> What did the old Woman
say?</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> she did not perceive
my Master's Meaning then; so she took no Notice
of it; and she having sate up Two Nights together,
I was order'd to sit up the next Night, and the old
Witch went to Bed.</P>
<P>When I came to sit up, Madam, my Master call'd
me to the Bed-side, Who are you? <HI>says he,</HI> for it
<PB N="240" REF="254"/>
was pretty dark by the Bed-side, having only a
Watch-Light, and that at a Distance; so I said, <HI>'Tis
I,</HI> Sir, <HI>do not you know me?</HI> With that he called
me by my Name; Is it you? says he, I am glad to
have you sit up with me, I want to speak with
you.</P>
<P>And then, Madam, said she, my Master sur∣priz'd
me; I knew how he had been seduced and
drawn away by the Priests beyond Sea, and had been
prevail'd with to turn Papist, and there was such a
deal of superstitious Stuff among them here, especi∣ally
the Old Woman, that I could hardly bear the
House.</P>
<P>But my Master soon shewed me that he was an∣other
Man; told me he found Popery was a gay
Thing Abroad, and 'twas a mighty easy Way of
going on through Life, but there was nothing in it
to go through Death; it was no Religion to die
with; that it was a sad Thing to return too late, and
so near Death, but that he had been sick of it now
two Days, and the Old Woman, says he, has shew'd
me as much the Folly of it all, as any of them.</P>
<P>But has he had no Priest with him, said his
Sister?</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, says Nurse; there the Light began
to shine in upon him; the Priest and he fell out;
the Priest, it seems, urg'd him to confess himself, as
they call it; he told him he had: The Old Woman
answered, Has! to who, I wonder? here has been
no Confessor with him.</P>
<P>He answered with some Anger, he should con∣fess
himself no more.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says the Priest,</HI> no Confession no Abso∣lution.</P>
<P>I know it very well, <HI>says my Master.</HI></P>
<P>However, what with the Priest, and the Old
Woman together, they made him very warm, and, as
ill as he was, he told them aloud, God alone could ab∣solve
<PB N="241" REF="255"/>
him, and he would confess himself to him
alone.</P>
<P>The Woman, though his Servant, was saucy and
insolent; the Priest indeed used him better, that is,
with more Manners, but pressed him earnestly to
Confession, telling him that tho' God alone could
pardon, he had given Power to his Servants, for
the Comfort of the Penitent, to pronounce them
absolv'd in the Name of Jesus Christ, provided they
made a full Confession.</P>
<P>He insisted he would make no other Confession
for the present, and so the Priest modestly enough
withdrew; but, adds Nurse, the Old Woman has
so teiz'd him Night and Day, that she really has
not given him Time to rest when he might have
rested; and, in a Word, has talked so foolishly
too, that he has seen farther into the Emptiness of
Popery, by her Means, than ever he did before.</P>
<P><HI>says the Sister,</HI> That is but a poor Light, to see into
Popery by Fools, and makes but few Converts.</P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> but Popery is a Reli∣gion
for Fools, and my Master saw by it how the
Ignorance of the People was the Support of Po∣pery.</P>
<P>He knew all that before, <HI>says his Sister,</HI> and used
to tell me there was no Need that the common
People should know any thing; 'twas enough for
them that the Priest understood how to pray for
them; that they were only to repeat the Words
in <HI>Latin,</HI> and believe they were such Prayers as they
ought to say, and that God would accept the Devo∣tion
without the Words.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, but my Master is of another Mind
now, I assure you; and he gave me a long Account
how he was drawn in; but that which I heeded
most, was how he was brought out of it all again,
which he said was occasion'd by some Things you
<PB N="242" REF="256"/>
said to him and shew'd him, about praying to Saint
<HI>Ann,</HI> and about the Pope's selling of Pardons.</P>
<P>I remember the Passage, <HI>said his Sister;</HI> but that
was a good while ago.</P>
<P>Let it be when it will, Madam, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> that
gave the first Blow to it all.</P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> pray go on with what
he told you that Night.</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> he complain'd heavily
of the Old Woman dunning him to confess himself,
till at last, says he, I bid the old Fool be quiet, and
let me go to sleep; after which, added he, she sat
rattling her Beads, and saying <HI>Latin</HI> Prayers so
loud, that tho' she thought I was asleep, I heard her
all the while.</P>
<P>After this, Madam, I took the Freedom to say to
my Master, Sir, pray, seeing your Eyes are now, blessed
be God, opened, and you are convinc'd of the Wick∣edness
of all these Things, why do you let all these
Trinkets hang about you?</P>
<P>About me, what do you mean? <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>Why, Sir, said I, about your Bed, and the Cur∣tains,
and almost every where.</P>
<P>I know nothing of them, <HI>says he,</HI> shew me some
of them.</P>
<P>So I took down two or three little dirty Bits of
Bone and Wood, and shew'd them to him; <HI>Here,
Sir, said I,</HI> what are they, I beseech you? I be∣lieve
they are Charms, or Spells, or some such
Things; I believe she is a Witch.</P>
<P>O! says he, I see, these are holy Relicks to keep
evil Spirits away.</P>
<P>I beseech you, Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> pray to God to keep
you from the evil Spirit, and do not deal in such
Things as these; I am afraid to touch them.</P>
<P>Take them all down, <HI>says he,</HI> and do not be afraid
of them; the <HI>Devil</HI> can do nothing with them, any
more than without them.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="257"/>
So I took them all down, but when I came to
the Easy-Chair I was frighted; Sir, says I, pray
what is the Matter with this poor Chair?</P>
<P>Why, what ails it? <HI>says he.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, Sir, says I, 'tis all Witchcraft; why, here is
a Hundred Crosses upon it, they hang all over it; I
dare not sit in it.</P>
<P>Do not be afraid, <HI>says my Master,</HI> take them all
away.</P>
<P>In short, Madam, I clear'd the Room of all the
Popery, and all the Popish Pictures, by my Master's
particular Order, and carry'd them all into the Old
Woman's Room, where she was fast asleep; and
then my Master, tho' he was spent with talking, said,
his Mind was easy, and he would go to sleep; and
so he did, and slept better than he had done in se∣veral
Nights for almost two Hours.</P>
<P>But, says the Sister, Pray what said the Old
Woman to all this?</P>
<P>I will tell you that by and by, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> but
pray let me go through with the rest.</P>
<P>Do so, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> for 'tis a very pleasant Story
to me, I assure you.</P>
<P>Why when my Master wak'd, I ask'd him how he
did? he told me, with some Warmth; <HI>Better,</HI> Nurse,
<HI>better a great deal;</HI> not that I am in less Pain, or
that the Fever is abated, but I am better: Now,
<HI>adds he,</HI> if it be the Will of God I can dye, I have
purg'd my House and my Heart from Idols, and I
have been in Heaven all the while I have been
asleep.</P>
<P>He had had some pleasing Dream about it, I sup∣pose,
<HI>says his Sister.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, he had, says she, and he told me his Dream,
'tis very long, and I cannot remember it all; but
it was that the Devil held him fast with three great
Chains, till an Angel came from Heaven and de∣liver'd
him, and tied the three great Chains fast about
<PB N="244" REF="258"/>
the Devil that he should take hold of him no more,
and then leaving the <HI>Devil</HI> chain'd to the Ground,
took him up, and carry'd him through the Air into
Heaven.</P>
<P>What a strange Dream was this, <HI>says the Sister!</HI>
O my Master, Madam, will tell it you all, <HI>says
she,</HI> there's a deal more of it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> but what followed?</P>
<P>Why, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> then he order'd me to
pull out such a Drawer, and there were three or four
Books in it; he bid me bring them to him, which
I did, and he made me promise him that as soon as
the Family was up, I would throw them in the Fire
and burn them all; and I faithfully perform'd it,
and brought up the Ruins of them to shew him,
that he might be satisfied; and my Master has
mended in his Health ever since; and especially now
he is easy in his Leg, I do not doubt but he will be
well again.</P>
<P>Well, Nurse, <HI>said the Sister,</HI> but what came of
the Old Woman?</P>
<P>Why, in the Morning, <HI>says she,</HI> my Master or∣der'd
me to <HI>pay her</HI> and send her away, with all her
Baggage, and I did so; but she went away cursing
and raving, and calling me all the Hereticks, and
damn'd poyson'd Hereticks, she could think of; nay,
cursed my Master, and all the House, before she
went.</P>
<P>But she march'd off, did she not? says the
Sister.</P>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>says the Nurse,</HI> she went away, and I
hope my Master will be troubled no more with
them.</P>
<P>All this while her Brother slept very found, and
Nurse looking in upon him, told her, she found him
in a sweet Sleep, and, as she thought, was in a little
Sweet; so the young Lady told her, she would go
Home, and come again in the Evening.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="259"/>
My Master will want you, Madam, says Nurse,
as soon as he wakes.</P>
<P>Nurse, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> this News is so surprizing∣ly
good, and our whole Family have so much Con∣cern
in it, that I cannot bear my Father should not
hear it; I must needs say, it troubles me he has been
without it so long.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> that's true, 'tis pity my
old Master should not hear it; but if my Master
wakes, what shall I say?</P>
<P>Say, Nurse, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> say the Truth, just as
I say it to you; tell him that I am gone home, to let
my Father know a Piece of News, that, I am sure,
will be to him like Life from the Dead; like the Fa∣ther
of the Prodigal, in the Gospel.</P>
<P>I will leave out the last, Madam, <HI>says Nurse,</HI> if
you please, perhaps it may trouble him.</P>
<P>Well, do then, <HI>says the Sister,</HI> tho' I don't think
'twill trouble him, to tell him how his Father will re∣joice
over him.</P>
<P>After this, the Sister came away, and brought the
News to his Father; but it is not to be express'd,
with what Tears of Joy the whole Family received
the News; with what Extasies of Joy and Thank∣fulness,
his Father received it, who might well say,
<HI>This my Son was dead, and is alive again; was lost,
and is found.</HI> The Narrative of this remarkable
Return of a Penitent, is too long for this Work;
it would fill a Book by itself, and, perhaps, may,
in its Time, in order farther to set out the Delu∣sion
of Popery.</P>
<P>At present, I close this Part, by adding, The
young Gentleman recovered apace; and as soon as
he was well enough to be removed, his Father
caus'd him to be brought home; where he lay ill
several Months, for tho' his Leg was perfectly well,
<PB N="246" REF="260"/>
yet it had brought him into a declining State of
Health: But he recover'd at last thoroughly, conti∣nued
a Protestant, very sober and religious; and the
Father kept the Day of his Re-Conversion, as a Day
of Thanksgiving in the Family, as long as he
lived.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Success which the good Gentle∣man,
the Father of this well instructed
Family, I have been speaking of, had
met with, in the Popish Controversy
with his eldest Son, and the good Ef∣fect
it had, both upon his said Son, and all the
rest of his Children, not only instructed his Family,
but it gave his Words and Discourses to them a
greater Force and Energy, upon all such Occasions,
than it would otherwise have had; and had also this
particular good Effect, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Children al∣ways
applyed to him, as to their Oracle, when any
religious Doubt or Dispute appeared upon the Stage,
in their Time.</P>
<P>Upon these Occasions, he took a particular Me∣thod
of his own, which yet, will, I believe, recom∣mend
itself to many other judicious and capable
Persons, who are Heads of Families; as, perhaps,
<PB N="248" REF="262"/>
the best and clearest Way to enforce their Instructi∣ons;
and this was,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To bring all Things into as short and concise
Heads of Dispute as he could, that it might be
the easier retain'd in the Memory of his young
Audience.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He endeavour'd to bring solid and sufficient
Vouchers to prove every Thing that he said,
confirming his Instructions from ancient and
authentick Authors; such whose Authority
could not be disputed, much less deny'd, and
as much as possible from the Scripture itself,
as the great Oracle of all Truth, establish'd and
undisputed in it self.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He digested all in a familiar Way, easy to be
receiv'd, and to be understood by the meanest
Capacity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He brought as much of it as he could into
Story, that it might be pleasant and diverting,
and consequently be entertain'd by the Enqui∣rers
with Pleasure and Delight.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By this happy Method of Plainness, and a plea∣sant
agreeable Way of Talking, he made his Family
greatly delighted in hearing his Instructions, and
eagerly to receive them; so that they often used to
come and ask him Questions upon such Heads as they
found disputed in the World, and to desire his
Opinion.</P>
<P>It was upon a particular Occasion that his eldest
Daughter, of whom I have said so much already,
begun thus with him one Day at Dinner.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>said she,</HI> you used to relate something or
other to us that was improving and diverting too,
<PB N="249" REF="263"/>
and of the highest Importance; have you nothing
left in your Thoughts to encrease our little Stock
of Knowledge?</P>
<P>Truly Child, <HI>says the Father,</HI> I found such Diffi∣culties
fall in my Way, in our last Discourses of this
Kind, that it made me sometimes wish I had never
begun them: It held me so long, and was so un∣happily
thwarted by your Brother, that I sometimes
was ready to fear I should never get thro' it, and
that I had done more Harm than Good in my
Family.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, your Success at last was enough
to encourage you; Besides, Sir, What had you to
fear in so good a Cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I am no Divine, no Casuist, I had not
studied the Dispute other than as a private Christian
had, and as every private Christian ought, to fur∣nish
my self with so much of the Argument, on both
Sides, as satisfied me in the Choice of my own
Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I dare say, you were not afraid my
Brother should be too hard for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank God I did not fear that either your
Brother, or his Priest, or any other in Conjunction
with them, would have shaken my own Principles;
but I did not know how far they might, by their
Sophistry and Cunning, insinuate into your young
Heads. <HI>Popery</HI> proposes a fine easy Way of sliding
into Heaven, as a Man gets into a Prince's Ap∣partments,
by bribing a Page of the Pack-stairs;
or into a Nobleman's House, by bribing the Por∣ter
or Door-keeper; so that after a Life led
at large, and sinning by License, a formal Con∣fession,
and a bought Absolution, wipes out all the
Score, and the Offe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der goes on quietly as if he had
never sinned at all. I did not know what such a
Scheme of going to Heaven might do; I know it
has deluded many a well-meaning Christian, and car∣ried
<PB N="250" REF="264"/>
them so far out of their Way, that some have
never found their Way back, and I did not know
what it might do among you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, you got an easy Victory here;
I think verily you laught Popery out of Doors, at
least out of your own Family, I am sure you did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, but I was not always so merry
as I made my self, tho' I think truly 'tis the only
Way to deal with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a ridiculous Religion indeed; we
have been fully satisfied of that, and I believe laugh∣ing
at it, is as ready a Way to confound it as any:
I am sure we found it so in the Case of my Brother;
and my Brother is of the same Opinion too, now he
sees through it; he wonders how it was possible
he could be so deluded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what shall I go upon next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, We want mightily to have some
Knowledge of the Wonders of Nature; we see the
Outside of Heaven, Sir, every Night, and every
Day, and we hope to know the Inside of it here∣after
at once, by a full Discovery, at one Glance,
when all Things shall be reveal'd; but we would
be informed something of the Works of God on this
Side, as well those above us, as those about us,
which tho' we converse with every Day, we find
we know little of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you mean you would know some∣thing
of the Motions of the heavenly Bodies, their
Nature, Revolutions, Influences, the Reason of
their being made at the Beginning, and what shall
probably be their End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, that is, indeed, what we want
to know; my Brother has told us something of
them; but he is gone now, and has set us on fire
with an eager Desire to know the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="251" REF="265"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, hold there, my Dear, not your Brother,
or I, or those that are ten times more knowing than
I am, can teach you to know all the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>We believe that, Sir, but we desire to
know no more than you can teach us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The utmost Perfection of Human Knowledge
that can be attained to by us, and the best Use that
Knowledge can be put to in this World, is to lead
our Thoughts into Extasies of Admiration, Won∣der,
and Astonishment, at the Wisdom and Power
of the great Author of Nature, who has made
all those glorious Bodies, and directs all their Mo∣tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This still makes us the more desirous to
look into it, if you don't think it too much above
us, and that we should not enquire into what we
are not capable to understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I do not think it is above you at
all, nor above your Capacities, to know, that tho'
you cannot arrive to a compleat Knowledge, yet
you may understand enough both to give you an
abundant Store of useful and instructing Light in
the Works of Nature, and to lead you to a religi∣ous
Improvement of it all, that you may see Cause
to say, in the Words of the Psalm, O <HI>Lord, how
manifold are thy Works! in Wisdom hast than made
them all,</HI> Psal. civ. 24.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please, Sir, to give us a right
Taste of these Things, I hope we shall make such
a good Use of them as you shall direct us to, for I
have been told that there is a religious Improvement,
as well as a meer Encrease of Knowledge to be made
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is a Religious as well as a Mathe∣matical
Improvement in every Part of it, and they
go on Hand in Hand, running through every Branch
of it; but then I must tell you before-hand, it will
<PB N="252" REF="266"/>
be a long Study; it will take you up many Days,
perhaps Years, to go through it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we shall not be a weary of it;
we are told 'tis a very diverting Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not afraid you shall be weary of it, for
every new Thing you see and know will inflame
your Souls with new Desires to know more, and the
more you see, the more you will want to see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope if you are not tired▪ with Teaching
us, we shall not need to be tired with Hearing, and,
for my Part, I am resolv'd to take such Minutes of
all you tell us, by the Help of my little Scribe here,
[<HI>naming her youngest Brother</HI>] that we will be sure
to forget nothing you say to us.</P>
</SP>
<P>Thus far they were gone in their Discourse, and
the Father was telling them, by Way of Intro∣duction,
that he would prepare himself against the
next Day with some useful Generals, to give them
as a Scheme of his future Discourses. 1. That he
would provide a Pair of Globes for them, and
learn them the Use of them, that they might see
the Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, as he explain'd
it to them. 2. And some Maps of the several Parts
of the World, in order to teach them the Use of
them, and how to judge of the Situation, and se∣veral
Dispositions, of that Part of the World which
they would hear discours'd of in Conversation, that
so when they heard of any of the great Transactions
of the World, Armies marching, Sieges, Battles,
and the like, they might march along with them in
the Maps, and see where every thing was doing as
it was done.</P>
<P>He was going on with those Things, and they
were mightily delighted with the Expectation of
what they were to learn, when two Gentlemen came
in, who were very intimate in the Family, tho' not
related; one of them was a Minister, and the other
<PB N="253" REF="267"/>
a Gentleman, but of Learning, as well Religious as
Human, equal to the other.</P>
<P>These falling into Conversation, with the Gentle∣man
of the House, there happened, one Thing
drawing on another, to begin a warm Discourse
upon the new unhappily reviv'd Disputes, upon the
old <HI>Arian</HI> and <HI>Socinian</HI> Heresies, in which the Mi∣nister,
and the Gentleman, chiefly concerned them∣selves;
the Father, or Master of the House, very
little intermedling, only now and then interposing a
Word or two, and especially, as Moderator, when
they began to be warm, and, as he thought, to
break in a little upon Friendship and Decency.</P>
<P>The Minister was perfectly Orthodox in his Prin∣ciples,
and strict in the Practice of the Doctrines
which he taught, but insisted much, in his Dis∣course,
upon the Usefulness of Practical Divinity,
rather than to run into doubtful Disputations.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, as above, was Learned, Bright,
full of Knowledge, and full of Wit; conceiv'd clearly,
and express'd his Thoughts aptly and intelligibly,
but was tainted in Principle with the new Errors,
as to the Trinity; and, withal, a little of a Deist, or
Sceptick, or Free-Thinker, call them what you will,
and when the Divine pressed for a serious Applica∣tion
to the practical Part of Divinity, rather than
the Polemick, began to triumph over him, as if
he was baffled, and afraid to go on, at which the
Minister defy'd his Suggestion, and challeng'd him
fairly to the Dispute.</P>
<P>However they did not go far into it at that Time,
but so far as to draw on a Discourse between the
Father and his Family, which issued in resolving,
by Consent, to adjourn their Philosophy for a while,
and to desire their Father to inform them a little how
the Case stood with respect to the many Disputes
that were now in the World about the great Arti∣cles
of our Faith.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="268"/>
His Daughter, who was a Leader of the younger
Children in all their Enquiries, told him she thought
they had been fully instructed in all the Principle,
and Fundamental Articles of the Christian Religion
in their Catechism, and by his former Instructions;
but those Gentlemen, that call themselves Free.
Thinkers, says she, are enough to beat us out of all
Principles, and unteach us all we have learn'd.</P>
<P>Why Child, <HI>says the Father,</HI> what do you meet
with among them that shocks your Principles? what
Books have you been reading?</P>
<P>I have not read many Books, <HI>says she,</HI> but we
meet with it in all our Conversation; People argue,
I think, against all the Essential Points of Religion,
and they seem to love it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an unhappy Pleasure some People take
in endeavouring to argue themselves not into good
Principles, but out of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is strange they should argue and di∣spute
not to clear up their Understanding, but to
darken it, and to put out the little Light they have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Effect of a Natural Reluctance,
which People have to what is good: They would be
mighty glad there was neither Heaven, or God, or
Future State; they are very uneasy, left the Affir∣mative
should be true, because then giving an Ac∣count
to them, being judg'd and sentenc'd by them,
and in that State too, appears a Consequence; and they
would be very glad there was nothing in that Part,
for many Reasons too evident to need a Repetition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they seem now to go upon another
Point, not so openly wicked as that; they tell us, they
acknowledge a God, a Heaven, and Future State,
and all those Things, but they have taken away all
the Terrors that stuck so close to them upon those
Accounts before; and now, upon their new Noti∣ons,
they are very easy, and talk of all those Things
as if they were settled in their Favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="255" REF="269"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they have establish'd an entire new
System of Heaven and Hell, God and Devil, all to
their full Satisfaction.</P>
<P>1. They do not, indeed, directly deny a GOD,
but they acknowledge him in such a Manner,
and bring the Deity, which they pretend to
own, under such Regulations and Restrictions,
that they scarce allow him to be a GOD at all.
They will have him be so good, so merciful,
so beneficent, that he cannot be Just; They
take all Resentment from him, let the Wick∣edness
of Man be how great soever: As to
Punishment, that they will not allow at all, they
tell us, it is not consistent with the Nature of a
<HI>Deity;</HI> and all those Things which we see ex∣ecuted
by the Divine Vengeance in the World,
they call Accident, Temporary, and such like;
covering THINGS with WORDS, and amusing
us with being quite wrong, as they call it,
about Hell, and a Future State of Perdition,
which they make a Jest of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is just what I mean, Sir, tho' I did
not express it so clearly; but you speak their own
Language, the very Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, their Meaning is the same, and
they express it much alike; but let them express it
as they will, they aim at something, and it is indeed
too much the Way of those People, who wish to
have Things as they represent them; but I hope
this will not go far with you: The <HI>Being of a God</HI>
is an Original Beam of Light shining into the Soul
from the first Hour of its being able to judge and
reflect: The whole <HI>Book of Nature</HI> teaches it, and
all Nations consent in acknowledging it, and, as you
say, they allow that Part; indeed they cannot
help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="256" REF="270"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, they do not pretend to deny the
<HI>Being</HI> of a GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It follows naturally, if there is an infinite eter∣nal
Being, a great first Cause of all Things, He
must be infinitely Wise, Good, Righteous, Holy
and Just.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They grant all that too, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if he is infinitely holy and pure,
he cannot look on Sin, which is in its Nature all
Impurity and Corruption, without Abhorrence, and
by Consequence of his Justice, he must look on the
Sinner with <HI>Resentment</HI> and <HI>Displeasure:</HI> How else
can he be Just?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they will not allow that, they
say he looks on them with Pity indeed and Compassi∣on,
but no Anger and Displeasure, which is below
his Infinite Greatness, and the Sovereignty of his
Mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must hold such Men to the known Rule
of Reasoning, which is, That <HI>they that affirm a
Thing, are oblig'd to prove it,</HI> otherwise they shame∣fully
beg the Question; pray put them upon the
Proof of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say it is against Reason to argue
otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we say 'tis against <HI>Revelation</HI> to argue
so: <HI>The Wrath of God is revealed from</HI> Heaven
<HI>against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of Men,</HI>
Rom. i. 13.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir, they despise all <HI>Revelation</HI> and
all <HI>Scripture.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I think all they say merits to be de∣spised,
and themselves to be despised too, only that
we pity and pray for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, cannot we answer them a little
too, cannot we talk to them in their own Way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, you may answer them in their own
Way too; they say 'tis arguing against Reason to
<PB N="257" REF="271"/>
argue, that God is angry at the Sinner, resents, and
will punish him; and we say, that to say he is not
angry, and will not deal in the utmost Vengeance
and Resentment against the guilty Sinner, unless he
repents, is arguing against Fact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that is taking them in their own
Way indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To argue against Reason is unreasonable,
but to argue against Fact is impracticable; 'tis not
to be done; Reason may be doubted and question'd,
but Facts are Matters of Evidence, and undeniable;
Demonstration is above Argument; when the Mat∣ter
of Fact is brought out and set in open Light, all
Argument is at an End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, Sir, the Rulers and Elders of old
seem'd conquer'd by this very thing which you call
<HI>Evidence of Fact,</HI> in the Case of the Apostles <HI>Peter</HI>
and <HI>John;</HI> they conferr'd together about what they
should do to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, and it is very direct to the
Case; have you a Bible? here, pray look for it, and
read it. [<HI>Speaks to his Daughter.</HI>]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is, Sir, it is in <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 16. <HI>What
shall we do to these Men? for that indeed a notable
Miracle hath been done by them, is manifest to all them
that dwell in</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and we</HI> cannot <HI>deny it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you see now Matter of Fact silenc'd
those very Enemies, that in spite of Conviction
would not believe before; they had not a Word to
say where Fact appear'd: <HI>We cannot deny it,</HI> say
they, <HI>we cannot argue against Demonstration,</HI> it is not
to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, Sir, where are these Facts to be

</SP>
<SP>

<P>The World is full of them, Child, the Justice

always been so, and is still reveal'd so every Day:
But not to run into History, we have frequent
<PB N="258" REF="272"/>
Examples, every Hour, before our Eyes; here was
one, the other Day, that affirming a Thing he knew
to be false, wish'd he might drop down dead imme∣diately
if it was not true, and immediately he sunk
down and died, having only Time to acknowledge
that he had lyed, and that God was just; You know
the Story, Child, and that it is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a dreadful Story, indeed, and we have
all heard it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is a plain Evidence of Fact; I can
give you five or six such within the Compass of my
own Memory: A Man giving a false Evidence in
one of our Courts of Justice, as soon as the Clerk
had express'd the Words, <HI>So help you God,</HI> and the
Man kiss'd the Book, he fell down dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a new Way of arguing with them
indeed, and I should think they could not stand
against it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>History is full of these Examples, God's Ven∣geance
on Drunkards, Prophane Swearers, Mur∣therers,
and such as have acted in Defiance of God,
and of Conviction; Besides, the Case of <HI>Ananias</HI> and
<HI>Saphira,</HI> and besides Scripture Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, though they will not allow Scrip∣ture
Doctrine, they cannot deny Scripture-History;
they cannot deny the Facts related in Scripture,
nor can they bring any Evidence against the Fidelity
of the Relations, or of the Relator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let them look into the Story of <HI>Achan,</HI>
who conceal'd his Theft, and hid the forbidden
Plunder, who was detected by casting a Lot, which
was the immediate Hand of Heaven, and singled
out the very Man; again, inquire into the visible
vindictive Infatuation of the <HI>Jews</HI> at the Destructi∣on
of <HI>Jerusal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> and how they fir'd their own
Temple, how they acted, in their own Ruin, against
the common Dictates of Reason, against common
<PB N="259" REF="273"/>
Sense, against the very Endeavours of their Enemies
to save them, which made <HI>Titus,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Em∣peror,
say, They were fated to Destruction; then
let it all be trac'd back to the Prophecies of Christ,
who so directly foretold that Destruction, as well as
appointed it; and let them tell us whether Heaven
has no Thunders, executes no Judgments, excites
no Power in Vengeance against his offending Crea∣tures:
If not, how came the Destruction of <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>
to be first threaten'd as a Punishment, and then
executed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it is plain to me that it is other∣wise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Experience of all Ages, and almost of
all Nations, is against them, besides the Testimony
of the Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They despise the Scripture; they deny its
being of Divine Original, and, by Consequence, its
being of Divine Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cannot detect it of one Falshood; there
are no Prevarications found in it; it lays down Pre∣cepts
of strict Virtue, guides to every Thing that
is good and virtuous, clean and perfect; condemns
every Thing unjust, dishonest, dishonourable, or
wicked; 'tis a perfect Rule of Uprightness, it has
all the Marks of Divine Impression upon it that
can be thought of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cavil at almost every Thing they
find in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they can overthrow nothing in it,
and the very History of it, as a Book, is really
wonderful, and goes a great Way to argue its Di∣vine
Original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Substance of it seems to tell us from
whence it proceeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Writers of it give undoubted Evidence
that they were divinely inspir'd; the Manner of
their Writing, the Agreement of the Prophecies
<PB N="260" REF="274"/>
oue with another; God revealing himself, in a won∣derful
Manner, by little and little, one Age after
another; the Church sees her Doctrines form'd under
the Hands, and by the Pens of Men enlighten'd by
heavenly Inspiration, <HI>Prophets, Apostles, Evange∣lists,</HI>
whose Works put all together, make up the
Body of the Scriptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is an universal Agreement among
all the Writers, whether of the Old or New Testa∣ment
in promoting the same Divine Truths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Either we must read it without the least At∣tention,
or must have no Taste at all of Divine
Things, if we do not find our selves oblig'd to ac∣knowledge
it is GOD and not <HI>Man,</HI> who speaks
throughout the whole Book, and who was the first
true Author of it: One immediately sees the Stamp
of his Divine Authority upon every Part of it;
there is surprizing Majesty and Greatness in every
Word; it captivates the Mind, and gives the Soul
such an Elevation of Thought, as cannot be found
in any other Writings: At the same Time one sees
that Majesty temper'd with a Sweetness and Softness
so levell'd and accommodated to our Weakness, that
'tis easily to be discern'd that 'tis God speaking to
Men, even in every Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it may be said of the whole Scrip∣ture,
as the Scripture says of Jesus Christ, John
vii. 46. <HI>Never Man spake like this Man,</HI> so <HI>never
Man spake like this</HI> BOOK.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are three particular Characters of the
Scripture, which concur to prove it to be the Word
of GOD.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Knowledge they give us of God, that
they give a full Testimony to his Being, Na∣ture,
and glorious Attributes.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="261" REF="275"/>
2. That they teach Man the Knowledge of him∣self;
they fully discover him to himself, and that
in a very particular and inimitable Manner.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That all its Prophesies, of which it is so
full; whose appointed Time has been come,
have been punctually and exactly accom∣plish'd.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those are very remarkable Things indeed,
especially the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too long to go through the Particulars,
but it is very remarkable that not one Prophesy has
yet fail'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, I believe, what we have not
throughly consider'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, take it only now as if you were no
way concern'd in the Dispute about it, but were
perfectly indifferent, and that you were not a Christi∣an
but only a reasonable Heathen.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here is a BOOK appears among us, it has been
put into our Hands by our Ancestors, and into
theirs by their Fathers before them; for almost
Four Thousand Years it has been publickly
receiv'd in the World.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. It is a Record of divers Things, which at se∣veral
Times, and in several Parts of the World,
GOD had reveal'd to different Persons concern∣ing
himself.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. This Book speaks of God in such a Manner,
that we must give very little Heed to it if we
do not see that 'tis GOD himself that speaks, and
that he purposes by it to make himself known
to us by this Manner of Revelation: This is
an undoubted Truth, nor has any Body op∣posed
<PB N="262" REF="276"/>
it for many Ages, till a Generation is
started up among us, who are pleased to shut
their Eyes against the common Testimony of
so many Nations, and so many Ages; and why
should we refuse to hear the Voice of Truth it∣self,
so long receiv'd and acknowledg'd by the
whole World?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they do refuse to hear or receive it
for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it be hid, <HI>'tis hid unto them that are
lost,</HI> 2. Cor. iv. 3. and it must be true, as the same
Text says, ver. 4. <HI>The God of this World</HI> (that is the
<HI>Devil) has blinded the Eyes of them which believe
not.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall we argue with them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, the same Scripture seems to allow there
is no arguing with them, for if the <HI>Devil</HI> has blinded
them, how should Reasoning open their Eyes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then must be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Convince our own Reason, and confirm our
own Faith, and we have nothing left to do, as to
those People, but to pity and pray for them</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my Part, I firmly believe the Scrip∣tures
are the Word of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that they are the Revelation of God; a
Revelation from himself, and of himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and tho' written, or put into Writing,
by the Pens of Men, yet, that they were dictated and
directed by the immediate Inspiration of the Spirit
of Truth, which is GOD himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, my Dear, I may say as our Saviour
says in another Case to St. <HI>Peter; Flesh and Blood
hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which
is in Heaven,</HI> Matth. xvi. 17.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Sir, these People go farther,
for after they have brought in Question the Justice
<PB N="263" REF="277"/>
of God, they immediately proceed to disrobe him of
all his Glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, they would have a GOD with∣out
a Devil, according to <HI>Epicurus;</HI> a God Wise
and Powerful, but not infinitely so, not Omnipo∣tent,
not Self-sufficient, and All-sufficient; a GOD
that having created the World (and 'tis with some
Difficulty they go so far) has not Power to guide
it, but has abandoned it to the Government
of it self; to that foolish <HI>Nothing,</HI> that unexisting
Piece of Nonsense, call'd <HI>Chance;</HI> or like the Fol∣lowers
of <HI>Zeno</HI> that Deist Philosopher, a God depend∣ing
upon (they know not what, of a) blind Destiny;
a God who not being able to break the Chain of
second Causes, is carry'd away with them himself,
being obliged to act by the Course of natural Conse∣quences,
even whether he will or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed this is exactly their Way of
Talking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, the Scripture exposes and confutes all
these, and that not only by its absolute Divine Au∣thority,
but by the convincing Force of its own
unanswerable Arguments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is what I would be able to answer
them with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in nothing more clear than in this very
Thing, which they oppose, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the executing Ven∣geance
upon obstinate Sinners, which they would
deny, making his Justice clash with his Nature, <HI>which
is ever to have Mercy and to forgive.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Now 'tis evident in the Scriptures, that God not
only executed his terrible Vengeance upon Sinners,
and against whole Nations of Sinners, but that he
had predicted, threatned, and, as I may say, pro∣mised
to execute that Vengeance upon them, many
Years, nay, many Ages before it came to pass; and
that it has come to pass at the End of those many
Ages, exactly to the Time when it was predicted
<PB N="264" REF="278"/>
and threaten'd▪ The Scripture is full of those
Predictions, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Accomplishment too, and
both ways they confirm their own Divine Authority,
as well as vindicate the Justice of God, and shew us
how consistent it is with his Mercy and Goodness to
punish.</P>
<P>1. It confirms the Divine Authority and Original
of the Scripture, for who but GOD himself could
foretel what God himself would do? and this too,
so many Years, and Ages of Years, before it came
to Pass?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, give us some of those Pre∣dictions,
I suppose or guess at them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name such, <HI>my Dear,</HI> as you aim at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first, the drowning of the World;
I understand it was revealed to <HI>Noah,</HI> as we find it
in the Scripture 120 Years before its Accomplish∣ment,
<HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 17. <HI>Behold I, even I, do bring</HI> a Flood
of Waters <HI>upon the Earth;</HI> and again, God foretels
it to <HI>Noah</HI> just a Week before it was to happen,
<HI>Gen.</HI> vii. 4. and accordingly it did happen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true, and is very much to this
Purpose; so also was the Bondage of the <HI>Israelites</HI> in
<HI>Egypt,</HI> and the driving out the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> when their
Iniquity should be come to its full Height, both
which were fulfilled even to a Day, <HI>the self-same Day,</HI>
Exod. xii. 17, 51. tho' predicted above 400 Years
before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Also the Captivity was foretold, as the Day
of God's Vengeance, many Years; (I think) above
100 Years before it came to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it was foretold (as a Thing that should
certainly fall upon them) in the Time of King <HI>He∣zekiah,</HI>
Isaiah xxxix. 6. and again in the Prophesy
of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> Cap. xv. 4. and, which is remarkable
in the Ruins of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation and Church, 'tis
expressly said it was <HI>the Vengeance of God</HI> upon them
for their Sins, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> xxiv. 2, 3, 4. <HI>For the Sins of</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="279"/>
Manasseh, <HI>at the Commandment of the</HI> LORD <HI>came
this upon</HI> Judah, <HI>and for the</HI> innocent Blood <HI>that he
shed, which the</HI> LORD <HI>would not pardon.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>So that here you have God glorifying his Justice,
and punishing his People with a terrible Judgment,
and it is expressly said to be for their Sins; and yet
the Mercy of God is Infinite still, nor is it any Im∣peachment
of his Mercy that he is pleased to exe∣cute
even the Fierceness of his Anger upon his Ene∣mies,
or that he will eternally do so at the last.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are more Examples in the Scripture,
Sir, but I do not remember them now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That particular threaten'd Judgment, which
I aim'd at in the Beginning, was the Destruction
which came upon <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for their rejecting of
Christ, which Christ himself predicted, and which
came to pass so soon, and so exactly, according to
his Predictions; for the City and Temple were entire∣ly
destroyed within Forty Years after, and that
with such a general Destruction, that it might be
said of the Temple, as our Saviour predicted, <HI>There
shall not be left here one Stone upon another, that shall
not be thrown down,</HI> Luke xxi. 6.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was an eminent Day of Vengeance
indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and it was all for their Sin, and particu∣larly
that Sin, of not <HI>knowing the Things of their Peace,</HI>
in the Day of it, <HI>that is,</HI> for rejecting Christ, and cru∣cifying
the Lord of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what are we to conclude from these
Things, to oppose the Objectors who cavil thus at
the Scripture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have two Things to argue from it.</P>
</SP>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the Scripture is of Divine Original, be∣cause
no Power on Earth could form Predicti∣ons
of Divine Truths, which should exactly
<PB N="266" REF="280"/>
come to pass in that Manner, but by the Inspi∣ration
of a Divine Power.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That it is no Impeachment of the Mercy and
Goodness of GOD, that he does let loose his
Vengeance upon obstinate and impenitent
People.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very plain indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go back next to the Books of <HI>Moses;</HI> The Pro∣phesies
there are of such a Nature, the fulfilling of
them so exceeding remote, and the Meaning of them
so very secret, that nothing but a GOD, with whom
all Things, past and future, are present, in his infi∣nite
Knowledge and Wisdom, could be able to dis∣cover
them; nothing but GOD could bring Things
into Knowledge which were not to come to pass till
so many Ages to come.</P>
<P>The Case of <HI>Noah,</HI> and the Deluge, predicted
120 Years before it came to pass, you have men∣tion'd
already: Come we next to <HI>Abraham;</HI> Consider
him as he was; An old Fellow of an Hundred Years
of Age, with an old Barren Wife, not less than
Ninety, and by the Course of Nature past Child∣bearing;
behold, these two receive a Prediction from
an Angel, That they shall have a Son: that from
the Loins of that Son shall be produced a potent
Nation, numerous as the Stars of Heaven; that
this People shall be all made Slaves for several Ages,
and that after 400 Years they shall be deliver'd, and
shall possess the Land of <HI>Canaan:</HI> How dark, how
remote, how improbable was all this? and yet every
Tittle of it is come to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, how slow and backward was it
in fulfilling, how gradual and how long delay'd wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Performance, as if the Promise had been for¦gotten,
and the Performance neglected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="267" REF="281"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true, after this Son was born, it
was Forty Years before he married, and when he
was married, 'twas Twenty Years more before he
had a Child; <HI>Rebecca</HI> was barren Twenty Years; And
<HI>Jacob</HI> was near Forty Years more before he took a
Wife; his Father, an old Blind Man as he was, gave
away his Blessing, indeed blindfold, and caused such
a Breach between the two Sons (all the Sons he had)
that the youngest was fain to run away to <HI>Padan-Aram,</HI>
and there he was Twenty Years more a poor Ser∣vant,
a meer Shepherd, without House or Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that, indeed, there was One Hundred Years
between the Promise of a Multitude, and any View
of the Family, there being only one <HI>Isaac</HI> and one
<HI>Jacob</HI> after him, and he but in very low Circum∣stances.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, for <HI>Esau,</HI> who was the Head
of the Family, and had all the Estate, knew no∣thing
of the Matter; he was Rich indeed, and Great,
and look'd something like being the Head of a Na∣tion,
and raising a Race; and a Race he did raise,
such a one as it was, and so did <HI>Ishmael</HI> too, whose
Race has now over-ran all the rest, <HI>I mean the</HI> Turks;
but God rejected all these, and the poor Shepherd
was the Man to be rais'd up, chosen to inherit the
Blessing that <HI>Bethuel</HI> and <HI>Laban</HI> gave to his Mother
<HI>Rebecca,</HI> namely, To be the Mother of Thousands of
Millions, and to have his Seed possess the Gates of
those that hated them; and all this, and many more
Things prophesied of them came to pass to a Tittle,
and to a Day, notwithstanding all those Delays,
notwithstanding their lying, as it were, forgotten
above an Hundred Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then <HI>Jacob,</HI> a plain Man, a meer Shep∣herd,
as you observ'd, Sir, not given to prophesy
at all, yet, when near his End, he calls his Twelve
Sons together, and, on his Death Bed, tells them
what should befall them all at the latter Days; that
<PB N="268" REF="282"/>
is, at the Distance of near 600 Years, and this as
punctually as if he had seen it all before him written
in a Book.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he tells <HI>Judah</HI> a Race of Kings should de∣scend
from him, and that the Scepter should not
depart from his Family for a great while: He tells
<HI>Zebulon,</HI> that his Lot or Partition of the Land
should come out to him by the Sea-side, and should
not be far from <HI>Sidon,</HI> all which came to pass to a
Tittle.</P>
</SP>
<P>Let us stop here a little, for this is a remarkable
Case; From whence had this poor old Man the
Knowledge of these Things? Was he any thing but
an old Shepherd, <HI>as you said,</HI> that lived all his Days
among the Flocks, and the Herds, and lodg'd in
his Tents? From whence could he arrive at all this
Knowledge? How should he come to know that his
Race should be such a powerful Nation? Could any
Thing human and mortal, arrive to the Knowledge
of such Things as these? No, no, nothing but
GOD could know that those Things were to follow;
and that they were to follow is evident, for they all
came to pass just as they were predicted: Can
any Thing Human act in this Manner! Could this
be without the Hand of GOD directing it all! it is
impossible.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, the Prophesies of the Capti∣vity,
which we nam'd last Night, are equally sur∣prizing
and astonishing, to that we may add, the
Prediction of restoring them to Liberty at the exact
End of Seventy Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and the very Name, Birth, and Quali∣fication
of the Person, or King, that was to deliver
them, all expressly fix'd and explain'd, and even the
very Manner in which it was to be done: How ma∣ny
Prophets foretel these Things, and how punctu∣ally
do they come to pass?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="269" REF="283"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed these Things do not look as if
Man could reveal and discover them, I cannot con∣ceive
which way they could be predicted; it must
be either from God or the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, now you have mention'd the De∣vil,
it is very well worth while to observe, that GOD
has thought fit to make the <HI>Devil</HI> himself a Witness
to the Superiority of Scripture Predictions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>First,</HI> 'tis plain, that the Devil knows
nothing before-hand; it seems very remarkable that
tho' he is an inlighten'd Seraph, an intelligent Spi∣rit,
yet God has with-held from him the Knowledge
of Futurity, or taken it away from him if ever he had
it; that the whole Glory of Scripture Prophesy might
naturally and necessarily center in himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you do not think the <HI>Devil</HI> has
any Power of Prediction, or the Knowledge of what
is to come!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all; except it be that he knows
his own Fate, that he shall be chain'd down at last
in the Regions of Darkness; but even of that he
does not know the Time, perhaps not the Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did not the <HI>Devil's</HI> Oracles predict
Things in the Time of the Pagan Idolatry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I cannot allow that they did, they gave
out subtle, ambiguous, and doubtful Answers, to
accuse and delude the credulous and ignorant Peo∣ple,
and this was the most; all the rest I take to
be fictitious, publish'd by the Priests, to support
their Credit; 'twas manifest, on many Occasions, and
particularly in the Case of <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Apostate;</HI> he
sent to all the Oracles, to all the Soothsayers, to all
the Augures, to know if his <HI>Persian</HI> War should be
prosperous, and they all flatter'd him with Promises
of Victory and Glory, whereas he was kill'd in the
very first Battle.
<PB N="270" REF="284"/>
History informs us of a certain famous She-Magician,
who pretended that the Devil spoke in
her, and so gave Answers to all the doubtful Questi∣ons
that were brought to her, and it was observ'd
that she spoke wonderfully of Things past, and gave
wise Decisions in Matters of Dispute; but she was
always at a Loss when they enquir'd of Things to
come, and in short, to use the Words of the Au∣thor
that wrote of her, <HI>The</HI> Devil <HI>always</HI> LYED <HI>when
he meddled with Prophesy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that the <HI>Devil</HI> knows nothing of what
is to come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nothing; How should the <HI>Devil</HI> know
any thing of what is doing in Heaven?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's true; I believe he has no Cor∣respondence
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are no Traitors there now, to discover
the <HI>Arcana</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I never consider'd that before,
I do not see how he, that is cast out from that Place,
should know any thing of the Counsels that are trans∣acted
there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this, I say, is a strong Confirmation
that the Scripture is of Divine and Heavenly Ori∣ginal,
since the Counsels of <HI>Heaven</HI> are revealed in
it, which neither Men or <HI>Devils</HI> could ever arrive
to the Knowledge of, but from <HI>God</HI> himself, who
rules in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and who alone could reveal them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we have no Reason to believe he'
would reveal them, especially to his Enemy the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what Purpose should those Things be re∣veal'd
to the <HI>Devil?</HI> has not God always chosen the
holiest and humblest, and the most beloved of his
Creatures to reveal his Mind and Will too; as, to
<HI>Moses, Elijah, Daniel,</HI> who the Text calls <HI>greatly
beloved,</HI> and to St. <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>beloved Disciple?</HI> and
would he honour the implacable Enemy of his King∣dom,
<PB N="271" REF="285"/>
and of his Glory, with the same Revelation?
it is not rational to think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, it is not reasonable to
think so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides you find, throughout the whole Scrip∣ture,
that the <HI>Devil's</HI> Agents could never foretel
any thing, but always accused and imposed upon
the People with Lyes and Delusions, and they are
therefore call'd false Prophets, and prov'd to be so
upon many Occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true indeed, they could not inter∣pret
<HI>Pharaoh's</HI> Dream to him, which foretold Things
to come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor could they reveal <HI>Nebuchadnezzar's</HI>
Dream to him, nor read the Hand-Writing upon
the Wall to King <HI>Belshazzar;</HI> nay, they told the
King in the Case of the first, that it was what no
Magicians upon Earth could do, or ever were
known to do, and that it was an unreasonable
thing for the King to desire it of them; for they
add, and therein they spoke Truth, <HI>there is none
other that can shew it before the King, except the
Gods, whose Dwelling is not with Flesh,</HI> Dan. ii. 21.
And <HI>Daniel</HI> in his Thanksgiving, <HI>ver.</HI> 22. of the
same Chapter, speaking of the Glory of GOD's infi∣nite
Wisdom and Knowledge, adds, HE <HI>revealeth
the deep and secret Things: he knoweth what is in
the Darkness.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we read that <HI>Balaam</HI> prophesied, and
yet he was a false Prophet, and is called so in the
Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a particular Case, wherein GOD ap∣peared
to a wicked Man, magnifying his Power in
over-ruling what the <HI>Devil</HI> designed to do by his
Hand, and is an Argument to prove what I say,
not contradict it; for GOD reduc'd that false Pro∣phet
to the Necessity of speaking Truth, and put
Words into his Mounth, and so GOD was pleased to
<PB N="272" REF="286"/>
make him prophesy of Christ; but it was, as he
owns, in a <HI>Trance</HI> a kind of Agitation, and he
spoke, by a particular Inspiration, Things which
without it he could have known nothing of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you conclude from all this, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say all this confirms the Divine Authority
of the Scripture, seeing as the Scripture is full of
glorious and inimitable Predictions, most of which
are already punctually come to pass, tho' at the Di∣stance
of Hundreds, nay, Thousands of Years, and
that it is apparent that the <HI>Devil</HI> has no Power of
Prediction, no Fore-knowledge of Things to come;
it must be then, that GOD alone has spoken in all
those Prophesies, that the Scripture is dictated by
his immediate Spirit, and that it is really the Word
of GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an Argument indeed which I never
heard before; I always thought the <HI>Devil</HI> could tell
Folks what would come to pass, and that made me
say before, that it must be either from GOD, or tho
<HI>Devil;</HI> I am sure the <HI>Devil,</HI> and his false pro∣phets,
have always pretended to it; but I am con∣vinc'd
now, and I see plainly, that, as you said, it
is not rational to think the <HI>Devil</HI> should have Cor∣respondence
in <HI>Heaven,</HI> or that the Counsels of Eter∣nity
should be betray'd to him; it is clear to me
then, that all the Scripture Prophesies are from
<HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All from <HI>Heaven,</HI> Child! all the Voice of
GOD! GOD speaking at first, and predicting; as their
fulfilling is the Voice and Power of the same GOD
performing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what Use now are we to make of the
Conclusion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A great many Things depend upon it; <HI>for
Example,</HI> Take it in general, if the Scriptures are
really the Voice and Word of GOD, and that GOD
himself speaks in them; if what is said there by the
<PB N="273" REF="287"/>
Mouth, or written there by the Pen of Men, or of
Man, is dictated and inspired by the Holy Spirit,
and immediately from GOD, then an intire Belief
of it is just and reasonable, and is our indispen∣sable
Duty: It is to be credited in every thing it
says, depended upon in every Promise, venerated
and trembled at in every thing it threatens, 'tis to
be receiv'd, as it indeed is, the Word of Life, the
Voice of GOD, able to make <HI>the Man of God perfect,</HI>
to make us <HI>wife to Salvation,</HI> and containing in it a
compleat Rule of Life, with every thing needful to
our eternal Felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that its Authority is sufficient in all
Arguments, is not that a Consequence too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mention that, Sir, because these People,
whom I was speaking of to you at first, and who oc∣casion'd
this Discourse, when I used to bring a Text
of Scripture to vouch any thing I had said, would
always throw it off with Contempt, laugh at it, pre∣tending
it prov'd nothing; and that it was liable to
so many Exceptions it self, that it could give no
Sanction to any Opinion one Way or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I suppose when you told them it was
the Word of GoD, they always ask'd you, How do
you know that? and how do you prove it to be <HI>the
Word of God?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, so they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, if they ask you so now, put this
Question to them back again, <HI>viz.</HI> Will you allow
it to be a good Evidence to the Truth of any Doc∣trine;
1. If I find such Doctrine clearly laid down
in the Scripture, and 2. If I prove the Scripture to
be the Word of God?</P>

<P>I think they cannot have the Face to re∣fuse
such a Propossal as that.</P>
</SP>

<HI>the Word of God,</HI> for the Reasons mention'd above.</P>

<P>They were not ignorant that it was

barefac'd Pretence into their Mouths, that it was

<P>It is certain the <HI>Jews</HI> believed the Scrip∣tures,

him when he came.</P>

<ITEM>2. <HI>Daniel's</HI> 70 Weeks were accomplish'd, for as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
Weeks make up 490 Years, reckoning a Day for
a Year, (as all Expositors agree to do) so Christ
was crucify'd exactly in the 490th Year, after the
Return from the Captivity. It may be added,
by way of Remark, as in another Case, <HI>that
self-same Year.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="277" REF="291"/>
3. The <HI>Second Temple</HI> was destroyed in the Time
of <HI>Titus Vespasian,</HI> and within 40 Years after
Christ; the <HI>Messas,</HI> therefore, must needs be
come, because it it expressly prophesied that he
should enter into the <HI>Second Temple:</HI> This
Temple has been gone almost Seventeen Hun∣dred
Years, and where then is the <HI>Messiah?</HI> If
he is not come, he will never come, for he can∣not
enter into the <HI>Second Temple,</HI> and so that
Prophesy of GOD can never be fulfilled; which
cannot be allowed, for Heaven and Earth shall
pass, but the Words of GOD shall all be ful∣filled,
and this must have been the first that
ever fail'd.</ITEM>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P>The first Dialogue having thus been taken
up in establishing the Divine Authority of the
Scriptures, and their Father having, as he thought,
sufficiently grounded his Children in their Belief of
this great Point, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the Scriptures being the
Word and Voice of God; he thought their Minds were
now the better furnish'd to combat other Errors, and
especially that great, and to many reasoning self∣cunning
People, fatal, Dispute about <HI>the Divinity</HI> of
Jesus Christ; his being one with the Father, GOD
blessed for ever; and on this Foot the Second Dia∣logue
began; the Daughter beginning thus.</P>
<P>The Blindness of the <HI>Jews,</HI> Sir, <HI>says his
Daugh∣ter,</HI>
in not believing that the <HI>Messias</HI> is already come,
and which you mention'd in your last Discourse to
us, is to me, an astonishing Thing, and I should
be glad to hear your Thoughts about that in par∣ticular.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart; but as my Thought
run much upon the yet more fatal Blindness of our
modern Christians, in denying the Dignity and
<HI>Glory of his Person</HI> now he is come, when they alllow
him to be actually come, and when they believe
him also to be the Messias, I had rather enter upon
that Subject first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="279" REF="293"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Sister named the other first, Sir, because
as it was first in Order of Time, so we thought it came
first in our Way to enter upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the other is a Dispute which seems to be
just now upon our Hands; 'tis the common Subject
of all religious Debates; 'tis the Foundation upon
which Atheism is making its New Fortification, and
entrenching it self in order to resist Gospel Revelation;
and as it unhinges our Faith, and makes way for all
manner of Looseness in Principle, so 'tis time we
should attack it with our utmost Force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where must we begin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we should begin with a brief Account
of the Enemy, when and how they have acted in
their assaulting that great Mystery of our Salvation,
<HI>God manifested in the Flesh.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be a useful History without
question, but it would be too long I doubt, Sir, to
give you the Trouble of running it back so far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They tell us it began in the first Ages of
Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Child, it began with Christ himself; I
mean, with his Ministry; for no sooner did he declare
himself to be <HI>the Son of God,</HI> but the <HI>Jews</HI> flew in his
Face, and took up Stones to stone him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet some of our modern People say,
He never did declare himself to be <HI>the Son of God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read but that eminent Scripture, <HI>John</HI> v. 18.
and <HI>John</HI> x. 33. in the first Christ had said, <HI>My Fa∣ther
worketh hitherto, and I work;</HI> and in the latter
he had sad, <HI>ver. 30. I and my</HI> Father <HI>are</HI> ONE; in
both these Texts the <HI>Jews</HI> charge him with making
himself GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is no Question but that Christ
intended it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis plain also his Enemies the <HI>Jews</HI> under∣stood
him so, and in both Cases went about to stone
<PB N="280" REF="294"/>
him, that is, to kill him as a Blasphemer: It is diffe∣rently
express'd, but the Meaning is the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in one 'tis said, <HI>Made himself equal
with God;</HI> in the other 'tis said, <HI>Makest thy self
God;</HI> if you please, Sir, I will look the Texts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, we shall want them again pre∣sently.
[<HI>She reads them.</HI>]</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first is <HI>John</HI> v. 18. Therefore the
<HI>Jews</HI> sought the more to kill him, because he not only
bad broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his
Father, making himself equal with God. <HI>The other
is John x.</HI> 30, 31, 32, 33. I and my Father are one.
Then the Jews took up Stones again to stone him.
Jesus answered them, Many good Works have I shew∣ed
you from my Father; for which of those Works do
ye stone me? The <HI>Jews</HI> answered him, saying, For a
good Work we stone thee not; but for Blasphemy, and
because that thou, being a Man, makest thy self
GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, the Substance is the same; in
both these Texts 'tis plain Christ asserted his Divinity
in the most express Terms.</P>

<P>I think so too, indeed, and yet these People
say he does no where say positively that he is God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What can he mean when he says I am the
Son of God? To be God, and to be the Son of

<P>I think 'tis plain, but they argue other∣wise.</P>

to hear her Father go on in the Expla∣nation

One would think, <HI>says her Father,</HI> the Opposers

the Dispute of the Words being authentick, I John

the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these
Three are One.</P>
<P>For could they take away the Force of those
Words, are not these the same, only with more
Force, as they come out of Christ's own Mouth, <HI>I
and my Father are One?</HI></P>
<P>But to speak of the other in its Place; the pre∣sent
Words are expressed, and without the least He∣sitation;
and the <HI>Jews,</HI> who understood him direct∣ly
as he understood himself, took up Stones to stone
him, because he made himself not only equal with
God; but made himself GOD; essential God.</P>
<P>Nor will that weak. Pretence stand them in stead
here, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Of its being meant only of their being
one in their Interest one in their Sentiments of
Things, which they call a simple Union, or a mo∣ral
Union; if they had understood him so, they
would never have taken up Stones to stone him;
for every just and good Man desires to be united
with God.</P>
<P>It is evident they understood him of a Union in
Nature and Essence, nor does he blame them for
any. Misconstruction, plainly acknowledging that
they understood him right, ver. 36. <HI>Say ye,</HI> Thou blas∣shemest,
because I said I am the Son of God? there he
owns that he had intended they should understand
him just as they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand it all, Sir, perfectly; I think
'tis clear that Christ asserts his Divinity very expressly,
and that saying he is the Son of God, is plainly say∣ing
he is God; but they make a great deal of Di∣stinction
between the Words GOD, and the <HI>Son of
GOD.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="282" REF="296"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident he meant none, in this Place,
nor did the <HI>Jews</HI> understand to make any; for in
<HI>John</HI> v. 18. where they say he made himself equal
with God, it was only upon that very Expression:
<HI>He not only had broken the Sabbath, but said also, That
God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very plain, Sir, that the <HI>Jews</HI> un∣derstood
the Words the <HI>Son of God</HI> to <HI>mean an
Essential Union</HI> and Equality, and yet those Men
will have it be that the Words God, and the Son of
God, are to be understood in the Sense of a higher
and lower.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and they found it upon those Words,
<HI>John</HI> x. 29. and xiv. 28. <HI>My Father is greater than
I,</HI> which are evidently understood of Christ in
the Form of a Servant; and such he was in his
Humiliation, as Mediator, which 'tis plain he di∣stinguishes
in the other Text of <HI>John</HI> v. 18. and
x. 30. In one Place he is attesting the Authority
and Dignity of his Person and in the other, he
describes the Subordination of his Office.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think that is easy to be understood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is particularly distinguish'd in that very
Chapter the xth of <HI>John,</HI> in the 25th Verse; he
describes himself as subordinate, <HI>The Works that
I do in my Father's Name,</HI> they bear Witness of me;
that is to say, the Works which he did on Earth
he did as a Servant in his Father's Name, and in
them he says, <HI>My Father is greater</HI> THAN ALL.
But when he comes to testify his Divine Original,
which is quite another Point, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That he pro∣ceeded
forth from God, and should return to God
again, then he says, <HI>I and my Father are one;</HI> and
adds, How can you have the Face to say I blas∣pheme
in saying <HI>I am the Son of God?</HI> or I am equal
with God! or as the <HI>Jews</HI> said of it, that <HI>I make
my self</HI> to be GOD, or as God; seeing I am the
Son of God, which is the same thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="283" REF="297"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Exposition is very convin∣cing,
Sir, I wonder they should not be able to see
into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They who are wilfully blind, see into no∣thing;
it may be truly said of them, that <HI>seeing,
they see not;</HI> they see, but will not see; otherwise,
What can be plainer than this Distinction, Christ
was on Earth in two Capacities? I. As an Original
Divine Being, which came <HI>forth</HI> from GOD, in
which he was of <HI>one Substance with the Father, by
whom all Things were made;</HI> as a Messenger sent
from God, who came hither by Divine Appoint∣ment,
to finish the Work which God gave him to
do, for the Salvation of Souls, and <HI>to give his Life
a Ransom for many.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>In this Work the Text is express, he took upon
him the <HI>Form of a Servant,</HI> he humbled <HI>himself to
Death,</HI> even <HI>the Death of the Cross;</HI> he was made a
little lower than the Angels, he was made a Curse,
made under the Law.</P>
<P>In this Capacity he might well say, <HI>My Father is
greater than I; The Cup that my Father bath given
me to drink, shall I not drink it?</HI> In this Capacity
he cries out to God as forsaking him; in this Capa∣city
he was in an Agony, sweat Drops of Blood,
became of no Reputation, was made Sin who knew
no Sin, and the like.</P>
<P>But when his Divine Original is the Subject, the
Scripture speaks of him in another sort of Stile, and
particularly he speaks of himself in another Stile; he
says, <HI>Hereafter you shall see the Son of Man coming in
the Clouds of Heaven;</HI> and likens his Kingdom to the
Dead hearing the Voice of the Son of God, in which,
they that hear shall live.</P>
<P>It is an unaccountable Assurance that these Men
speak with, who tell us he does not declare his own
Divinity, when he says expressly, I am <HI>the Son of
God, I and my</HI> Father <HI>are ONE I proceeded forth
<PB N="284" REF="298"/>
and came from God,</HI> John viii. 42. <HI>I am the living
Bread which came down from</HI> Heaven, John. vi. 51.
<HI>The Father is in me and I in him,</HI> John. x. 38. and
this the <HI>Jews</HI> called his making himself one with
God, as no doubt it was, and <HI>therefore sought
again to take him, but he escaped out of their Hands,</HI>
John x. 39. What greater, what plainer Declara∣tion
of his Godhead could be expected? and to
close it all, when the High Priest wanting Evidence
against him adjured him to tell them if he was
the Son of the <HI>Blessed,</HI> declared his Godhead
before them all, I AM: See <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 63, 64.
But Jesus held his peace. And the High Priest an∣swered
and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living
God, that thou tell us, whether than be the Christ the
Son of God. Jesus saith unto him, Thou bast said:
nevertheless I say unto you, hereafter shall ye see the
Son of Man sitting on the Right Hand of Power, and
coming in the Clouds of Heaven.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sou.</SPEAKER>
<P>What plainer Declaration of himself can our
People expect? they see it was such as the High-Priest
thought sufficient to condemn him upon;
nay, they said, <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 71. <HI>What need we any
further Witness?</HI> for we our selves have heard of his
own Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet, our People deny that ever he declared
it with his own Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they have a Cavil here, which they
improve with the utmost Art, and distinguish much
upon; they say there is a Difference between his
being God, and the Son of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see any Weight in it, 'tis a meer Cavil;
to proceed from God, to come forth from God, to be in
God, to be the Son of God, are all synonymous, and
are only Expressions of his Godhead, levelled to our
Understanding; for how would they have us to un∣derstand
the Words, the Son of God? Will they judge
of the Almighty after the Measures of Human Ge∣neration?
<PB N="285" REF="299"/>
to be a Part of infinite, is to be infinite; to
be the Son of God, begotten by the Father, is to be
the same in Essence with GOD, and therefore, our Lord,
as if he would take away all Pretences for such Ca∣vils,
adds, <HI>I and my Father are one; I am in the Fa∣ther,
and the Father in me.</HI>
This the <HI>Jews</HI> say, is expressly calling himself God,
or making himself God, and making himself equal with
God, <HI>John</HI> v. 18. <HI>John</HI> x. 33. and himself calls it, say∣ing,
<HI>I am the Son of God,</HI> John x. 34. with what Face
then can these Men put another Construction upon it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then they tell us these Words the <HI>Son
of God,</HI> are to be understood in a different Sense, and
they make nothing of all this; that the Title of
<HI>Son of God</HI> is given sometimes to the <HI>Angels,</HI> some∣times
to <HI>Soveraign Princes;</HI> sometimes to <HI>inferior
Magistrates;</HI> often times to <HI>Believers,</HI> and is used in
a figurative, and not in a literal Sense; so they
think they shall easily avoid the Force of all these
Quotations, by saying it is in a figurative Sense,
as a Metaphor, and Jesus Christ is called the Son
of God, figuratively, not properly and directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, they do make use of these Shifts
to escape the Force of the Words, but they are but
mere Shifts, and I may say Shuffling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They also tell us, which I understand they
take from the <HI>Jews,</HI> That he is called the Son of
God with respect to the Dignity of his Offices, and
the Honour which God has put upon him, of being
the Advocate and Mediator between God and Man;
adding, That his miraculons Conception, by the
Operation of the Holy Ghost, the extraordinary
Gift of the Spirit, which he was filled with from the
Spirit of God, also his Resurrection, his Ascension
into Heaven, all these having joined together, have
procured him this glorious Title of the Son of God,
and put him entirely out of the Reach of the other
Comparisons, such as of Angels, Kings, Magistrates,
<PB N="286" REF="300"/>
and Believers; but that notwithstanding all this, it is
still in a metaphorical Sense, a Sense which leaves an in∣finite
Distance between the SON of GOD and GOD, and
absolutely fixes the former in the Rank of a Creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have collected all their Arguments upon
the Subjects, in a narrow Compass, Child, I won∣der
where you have met with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are all collected, Sir, for me, to
my Hand, by an excellent Author, who I could re∣fer
you to, but I meet with them, too in ordinary
Discourse, Conversation is full of it, and I believe,
more so now than ever it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a sad Thing that it should be so; but
it is very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's very little Conversation now that
is any thing serious, or about religious Points, but
it turns all upon this Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, but let me take these Heads a
little asunder, and put you in a Way, if I can, to
answer them, where-ever you meet with them, at
least to answer them to your selves, so as that you
may be satisfied in your Minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is it I want, Sir, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first, if we had nothing but the simple
or single Expression or Phrase to speak of, <HI>viz.</HI> the
SON of GOD, they might have room to talk thus;
but the Case will not hold at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that, pray Sir? I do not under∣stand
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is true, that the Scripture does give
the single Title SON OF GOD to the several Heads,
as you have mention'd to Kings, to Angels, to Ma∣gistrates;
but is there not a manifest Difference in
the Manner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How Sir? What Difference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there is such a Distinction between the
Manner of the Expression, where the Scripture
gives the Title of Son of God, to those several Sub∣jects
<PB N="287" REF="301"/>
of it, which you mention, and when it gives the
same Title to Jesus Christ, that if we are the least
impartial, one cannot but see an infinite Difference;
it is impossible, indeed, not to understand the Dif∣ference,
and take Notice of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, explain that Difference then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>First take the Expression in the 2d <HI>Psalm,</HI>
there he is the Son of God, who reigns over the
whole World, and to whom the Kings and their
People are to render the most profound Homage
and Obedience, <HI>Psalm</HI> ii. 10, 11. <HI>Be wise now
therefore, O ye Kings: be instructed, ye Judges of the
Earth. Serve the</HI> LORD <HI>with Fear, and rejoyce with
Trembling:</HI> KISS <HI>the</HI> SON <HI>lest he be angry,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh,</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, I begin to understand you,
'tis very plain there, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look next into <HI>Proverbs,</HI> Cap. viii. and into
the Prophesy of <HI>Micah;</HI> in the <HI>Proverbs</HI> the Mes∣siah
is spoken of under the Title of Wisdom:
Read the Chapter, Child, from the 22d Verse to
the 30th inclusive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Here it is, Sir.</HI> [She reads the Words thus.]
The <HI>LORD</HI> possessed me in the beginning of his way,
before his Works of old. I was set up from everlast∣ing,
from the beginning, or ever the Earth was.
When there were no Depths, I was brought forth:
when there were no Fountains abounding with Water.
Before the Mountains were settled; before the Hills
was I brought forth: While as yet he had not made
the Earth, nor the Fields, nor the highest part of the
Dust of the World. When he prepared the Heavens,
I was there: when he set a Compass upon the Face of
the Depth: When he established the Clouds above:
when he strengthened the Fountains of the Deep: When
he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the Waters should
not pass his Commandment: when he appointed the
Foundations of the Earth: Then I was by him, as one
<PB N="288" REF="302"/>
brought up with him: and I was daily his Delight,
rejoycing always before him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, look in <HI>Micah,</HI> Cap. v. 2. there 'tis
much the same; there you have this <HI>Son of GOD</HI>
spoken of, as being antient as Time, and older than
the Foundation of the Earth, <HI>whose Goings forth
have been OF OLD from EVERLASTING.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that, in short, he is mentioned here as
a <HI>Son of God,</HI> from Everlasting; that is, the eternal
Son of God; that's, indeed, a glorious Text.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Word used in Scripture, to describe
Eternity, and is an Evidence that Christ is a Son of
God, not metaphorically, not in Allegory, but that
he was really so, and from all Eternity; an Ex∣pression,
they that cavil at the Divinity of the Son
of God, ought to tremble at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have never made this Observation be∣fore,
indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall produce you a great many more such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Way of Arguing, perfectly new
to them, I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next is in the Prophet <HI>Isaiah;</HI> there this
Son of God is called the <HI>mighty GOD,</HI> the everlast∣ing
Father; that is, the Eternal Father, <HI>the Prince
of Peace, Isaiah</HI> ix. 6. Are any of these People,
who are, as we may say, honoured with the Name
or Title of Son of GOD, or of GODS, I have <HI>said
ye are</HI> GODS: I say, are any of them called the
GOD, by way of Emphasis, much less <HI>the mighty</HI>
GOD, more less still the Eternal GOD, or Eternal
Father, which is the same Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here the Son spoke by way of Objection, or
rather Enquiry, whether the Words there translated,
the Everlasting Father, would bear the Construction
as that of the <HI>Eternal,</HI> or the Eternal God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ask, Sir, for my Information; I don't
pretend to object, because I am not able to judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="289" REF="303"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Everlasting and Eternal must be the same
Thing, and the Words can bear no other Constru∣ction;
for how can that be Everlasting, that is not
Eternal? That which is Everlasting had no Begin∣ning,
and can have no End; if it did begin, there
was a Time when it was not; and if it could end,
there would be a Time again when it would not be,
so that it cannot be Everlasting; but if it be with∣out
Beginning, and shall have no End, it is then
Eternal or Everlasting, and whatsoever is so, is GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am answer'd, Sir; it is plain enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To add, however, to my Construction of the
Word Everlasting, if you look into the <HI>French</HI> Bi∣ble,
which you understand well enough, you will
see the Word which we translate the Everlasting
Father, in <HI>Isaiah</HI> ix. 6. is there translated <HI>Pere d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
l'Eternitè,</HI> the Father of Eternity, or the Father
from Eternity; which, I think, is the same Thing
with the <HI>Eternal Father,</HI> and is not that the same
as the Eternal God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very plain, Sir; I am fully satisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, let us come to the Old Testament.
Well did our Saviour say to us, when he command∣ed
us to search the Scriptures, <HI>That they were those
which did testify of him, John</HI> v. 39. His Honour
is vindicated, his Dignity is asserted, his Person
declar'd throughout the whole Scripture: Let us see
how This <HI>Son of</HI> GOD is understood in the New
Testament, and how he is distinguish'd from those
that are called Sons of God in Allegory and Meta∣phor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the Thing I am listening for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first he is SUCH a Son of GOD as is
well-beloved of his Father, he in whom the Father
delights, or is well-pleased, according to those Em∣phatick
Words spoken from Heaven at his Baptism,
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> iii. 17. <HI>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, saying,
This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="304"/>
And again, at the Transfiguration, <HI>Matt.</HI> xvii. 5.
<HI>While he yet spake, behold, a bright Cloud oversha∣dowed
them: and behold, a Voice out of the Cloud,
which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased; hear ye him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, that's no Metaphor; sure they
won't pretend to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Word of God is full of those Things;
it is not for Nothing that Christ refers us to the
Scriptures for Testimonials of himself. Let us take
some of them in their Order as they lie.</P>
</SP>
<P>He is such a <HI>Son of God,</HI> as was with the Father
at the Beginning, 1 <HI>John</HI> i.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son</HI> as possessed a Divine Glory with the
Father before the World was, <HI>John</HI> xvii. 5.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son</HI> as was his only Son, <HI>the only begotten</HI>
of the Father, <HI>John</HI> i. 14. and iii. 16.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son</HI> as was God, equal <HI>one with the Father,
John</HI> x. 30.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Text seems to put all out of Que∣stion,
<HI>I and my Father are one.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is another yet stronger than all this;
where Christ speaking of the incorporate Union be∣tween
the Father and himself, says, The Father is i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>me,</HI> and I <HI>in him.</HI> Now, to be <HI>in God,</HI> is an Ex∣pression
no Man can assume; nothing can be so but
what is Divine.</P>
<P>To be <HI>in God,</HI> is to <HI>be God;</HI> whatsoever is <HI>in God,
is God.</HI> In him there's no Accident, no Qua∣lity;
but whatsoever is <HI>in him,</HI> is of his Essence,
and of his Substance. <HI>This Son</HI> therefore,
being in the Father, is really, and essentially,
and substantially GOD, as the Father is, and
must be so essentially.</P>
<P>Again, He is <HI>such a Son</HI> of GOD, as thought
no Robbery to be <HI>equal</HI> with GOD, <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 6.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="305"/>
<HI>Such a Son,</HI> as, before he took upon him our Na∣ture,
shone in all the Brightness of GOD the Father,
and was as the <HI>express Image of his Person.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Such a Son,</HI> as was in the Form of GOD, <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 6.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son,</HI> as by whom all Things were made,
<HI>John</HI> i. 3.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son,</HI> as is <HI>the Image</HI> of the invisible GOD,
<HI>Col.</HI> i. 15.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son,</HI> as that all Things were created by
him, and FOR him, <HI>ver.</HI> 16.</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son,</HI> as that all Nature reverences his Laws,
and stoops to his Authority; and all the Angels of
God are commanded to worship him.</P>
<P>In a Word, for when can I repeat it all?</P>
<P><HI>Such a Son</HI> of GOD, who is the Saviour and
Redeemer of the World, to whom all the Church
renders Worship and Adoration, and at whose Feet
those happy Souls, who are already receiv'd into his
Kingdom, cast their Crowns, and Worship at his
Throne, in the Presence and Habitation of God;
as is represented at large in the <HI>Revelations.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dare any one, after all this, say, that it is im∣properly,
and in a Metaphor, that Jesus Christ is called
<HI>The Son of God,</HI> and that there is no essential Diffe∣rence
in the thing as ascrib'd to him, or as it is
ascrib'd to other Creatures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or that he is called a Son in no other
Sense, than as the same Title is given to Angels, to
Kings, and to Magistrates?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Difference lies here, just as it is between
the Extremes of Contraries; one least, t'other great∣est;
one a Son from Eternity, the other a Son of
Two or Three Days; or, as is between the Creator and
the Creature; one a Son of God, worshipp'd and
ador'd as God, by Angels and Men, the other a <HI>Son
of God,</HI> who, under the glorious Title, or rather un∣der
Shadow of it, contains all the Impotence, Weak∣nesses,
and Infirmities inseparable from a Creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="292" REF="306"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly they know little of themselves,
however vain they are of being called reasonable
Creatures, who, after all this, can deny Christ to
be the Son of God, with full Propriety, the same
in Essence with the Father, and consequently ESSEN∣TIAL
GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, they cavil at it all; they say they
cannot comprehend how GOD can have a Son, who
can be a GOD like himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can they comprehend how he should own a
Son, or something, call it what you will, as pro∣ceeding
from himself, that can be any thing but what
he is himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cannot comprehend it, <HI>they say,</HI>
without making two several Gods, and that the Fa∣ther
who begot, and the Son who is begotten, must
be Two Gods, Two eternal everlasting Beings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>if they will</HI> have Two Everlastings,
<HI>they must;</HI> but I insist then, they must allow the Son

it must be to the Father: See that unanswerable Text,

<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, they say, is not meant of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we affirm it is plainly spoken of Christ,
and can mean no other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They insist that it cannot be; they cannot
comprehend it; they say there's no Sense in it, and
and it is impossible, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, blessed be God, it does not follow that
it cannot be, because they, who are given up to
Unbelief, cannot comprehend it; Is there nothing
to be believ'd possible, but what our Understanding
<PB N="293" REF="307"/>
can receive here? Is the Word of God to be de∣pended
upon for nothing? There are many Things,
doubtless, will be farther revealed in a future State,
which we cannot fully comprehend now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am clear in that Part, that as there is a
Glory to be revealed, so there will be a farther
Revelation of divine Truths in that State; that we
shall see abundance of Things to be reasonable, and
see the Reason and End of many Things then, which
we do not see now; and consequently we should
resign to the Authority of Revelation, and should
believe God upon his Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, besides this God would not have said all
these Things of Christ, if he had not been (as we
believe) united in Person and Essence to himself; nor
would <HI>Christ</HI> have said he was IN the Father, and
the Father IN him, and that the Father and he
were One, <HI>John</HI> xiv. 10, 11, 20; <HI>John</HI> x. 30, 38;
<HI>And that he proceeded forth from God; John</HI> viii. 42;
if it had not been so: Can any Thing proceed from
GOD, that was not in GOD? And can any Thing be in
God, that is not GOD? All that is in God, is GOD; for
the Eternal Being of God is infinitely and ineffably
ONE, and cannot be divided or separated into Parts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Mystery to be sure! a glorious
Mystery in it self! But that it is Reality and Truth,
that I think, is plain, and to be comprehended by
our Reason well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least it is to be comprehended sufficiently
to make it reasonable that we should believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to go from this Part a little, however
plain and express; if they will not believe what God
himself has said of Christ, and what Christ has said
of himself, let us lead them a little to the Scripture:
If the Word of God speaks it positively, that
Christ is God, why, and upon what Ground will
they deny it, seeing they cannot deny that the
Scripture is the Word of God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="294" REF="308"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, to that they say, the Name
of a GOD, or GODS, is given in Scripture, as a Name
of Grandeur and Excellence, and in that Sense it is
often given, as is said of the Title [<HI>Son of God</HI>] to
Angels, to Kings, to Sovereign Princes, Magistrates,
and the like, <HI>John</HI> x. 33. <HI>I have said ye are Gods,</HI>
that is giving a kind of Resemblance between the
exalted Condition of his Creatures, and the Maje∣sty
of the Creator; and thus they will have it be,
that Christ is called God in the Scripture; I give it
you, Sir, in their own Words here, from one of
their Books, for I could not give it you from my
own Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Here the Son held up a Book he had
in his Hand, and shew'd his Father the
Place which he had quoted it from.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, this is all they have for it; and if
you take away this Distinction from them, they
have not one Word more to offer in Defence of
their absurd Notion of a GOD Proper, and a GOD
in Metaphor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I think, nothing is easier in the World
of its kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear my Father say so;
for it has much puzzled my Thoughts sometimes,
seeing the bold Flourishes they make upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take this short Method for it, You may
observe that the Word JEHOVAH, which is ordina∣rily
us'd in our Bibles for the LORD, and is so
translated, is the proper and essential Name for the
true God: God explains it so himself, <HI>Isa.</HI> xlii. 8.
<HI>I am</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>that is my Name.</HI> And in
Chap. xlv. 5. <HI>I am</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>and there is none
else, there is no</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>besides me.</HI> The Words
in your Bible explain it, pray read the last.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[She reads.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am the <HI>LORD,</HI> and there is none else,
there is no GOD besides me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="295" REF="309"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see there the same Word for LORD
and for GOD; and so in several other Places in the
same Chapter ver. 7, 8. and Ver. 18. in particular,</P>
</SP>
<P>For thus saith the <HI>LORD</HI> that created the Heavens,
God himself that formed the Earth and made it, he
hath established it, he created it not in vain, he
formed it to be inhabited, I am the <HI>LORD,</HI> and there
is none else.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do we draw from this Part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>A plain and unanswerable Evidence of the
Divinity of the Person of Christ; for we should
find that Jesus Christ is called <HI>Jehovah</HI> also, and
that in several Places. I'll quote you but Two or
Three of the shortest, <HI>Psal.</HI> xcvii. 1. and xcix. 1.
JEHOVAH <HI>reigneth.</HI> In our Translation it is the
LORD <HI>reigneth;</HI> in the Original, it is JEHOVAH;
and the Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> expounds this directly
to be meant of Jesus Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 6. And
throughout all the Chapter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very plain that 'tis meant of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again, <HI>Isaiah</HI> tells us, Chap. vi. 1, 2, 3. <HI>I saw</HI>
JEHOVAH <HI>sitting upon a Throne, high and lifted up,
and his Train filled the Temple. Above it stood the
Seraphims: each one had six Wings; with twain he
covered his Face, and with twain he covered his Feet,
and with twain he did fly. And one cried unto
another, and said, Holy, holy, holy is the</HI> Jehovah <HI>of
Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</HI> Now,
who is this Lord called here JEHOVAH? St. <HI>John</HI>
says expresly, that <HI>Isaiah</HI> meant it of Jesus Christ.
<HI>John</HI> xii. 41. <HI>These things,</HI> said Esaias, <HI>when he saw
his Glory, and spake of him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How exactly one Scripture explains ano∣ther!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> calls him expresly
JEHOVAH <HI>our Righteousness, Jer.</HI> xxiii. 6. And he
has the same Title, <HI>Zach.</HI> iii. 6, 9. Now as this
Name is particular to the true GOD, Jesus Christ
<PB N="296" REF="310"/>
must then be the True GOD; for there are not se∣veral
JEHOVAHS: See <HI>Moses</HI> himself for that,
<HI>Deut.</HI> vi. 4. <HI>Hear, O Israel, the</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>our</HI> GOD
<HI>is one</HI> JEHOVAH. Or as it might be translated, JE∣HOVAH,
who is our JEHOVAH, is One JEHOVAH.
Now the Scripture giving the Name of <HI>Jehovah</HI>
both to GOD and to Jesus Christ, and yet at the
same time declaring there is but One JEHOVAH,
Jesus Christ must then be the true GOD; they can∣not
avoid the Force of this Argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am astonish'd at the Evidence of it;
I never enter'd into that Part of it; I think no∣thing
is clearer in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to make this Truth, however seemingly
difficult, still more conspicuous; let me put a Que∣stion
for you to those People, the Answer to which,
I think, will put it out of all Doubt, that Jesus
Christ is not called GOD improperly, or in an indi∣rect
Sense, and by Metaphor, in so many Places in
Scripture, but literally and expresly; my Question
is this, What is necessary to convince any Man, that
when a Name is given to any Person, 'tis done di∣rectly?
or, When may a Name be said to be given
to a Person, or a Thing, in the direct and mere li∣teral
Sense of it? When they have answered this,
we shall afterwards see, whether we cannot prove
that of Jesus Christ to be so given.</P>
</SP>
<P>When one sees a Statue, or Figure, or Picture
of a Man, and says, <HI>That it is a Man,</HI> and ano∣ther
sees that this Man has neither <HI>Flesh</HI> or <HI>Bones,
Thought</HI> or <HI>Motion;</HI> that it has neither Speech or
Understanding; he presently replies, or at least thinks,
that 'tis improperly, and but upon some light Si∣militude,
that 'tis call'd a Man.</P>
<P>But when we see that what we thought was but
an Image, is really a living Creature, bearing the
Name it represents; that with its Figure or Appear∣ance,
it sees, understands, acts, speaks and reasons,
<PB N="297" REF="311"/>
or disputes upon Objects and Things; I say, when
this appears, we should take him for an Enthusiast,
or a Dreamer, who should say that it was not really,
and with Propriety, to be called a Man.</P>
<P>We see appearing upon a Stage different Actors,
one represents a private Soldier, another a Captain,
another a King; we take them all as they are (<HI>viz.</HI>)
mere Representations; and 'tis no Delusion, the
Thing explains itself well enough.</P>
<P>But when we see a Man giving Law to a whole
Country, obey'd by the People, to whom they
pay Tribute, and to whom they pay all the Homage
which is due to a Sovereign Prince; we make not
the least Difficulty to say and point it out to any
Body, that this is really a Sovereign Prince, an Em∣peror
or King, and 'twould be foolish to the last
Degree, to ask whether it was done properly, or in a
Metaphor.</P>
<P>The Holy Scriptures, in several Places, have given
to Christ the Title of GOD, JEHOVAH, the
GOD <HI>of Hosts,</HI> the GOD of <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI>
and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and several other Titles, which are ne∣ver
given to any but the <HI>true</HI> GOD; the Reason
is plain, they acknowledge that there are all the
Characters in Jesus Christ, which belong to, and
describe the true GOD; <HI>such as these,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>The ETERNAL.</P>
<P>The ALL-KNOWING.</P>
<P>The ALMIGHTY.</P>
<P>The Strong GOD, <HI>Isa.</HI> vii. 5.</P>
<P>He who is, and who was, and is to come, the
ALMIGHTY, <HI>Rev.</HI> i. 8.</P>
<P>The CREATOR of all Things.</P>
<P>That nothing was Created without him, <HI>John</HI>
1, 2.</P>
<P>That he knew all Things.</P>
<P>That he came forth from GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="312"/>
St. <HI>Peter</HI> says to him, Lord, <HI>thou knowest all
Things,</HI> John xxi. 12. And the whole Body of the
Apostles, met at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and praying to Jesus
Christ with a profound Humility, say, <HI>Thou,</HI> LORD,
<HI>which knowest the Hearts of all Men.</HI> Again, see the
Inference made upon this infinite Knowledge of
Christ by his Disciples, when he explained his Say∣ing
to them, That he came forth from the Father,
and when he left the World, should return to the
Father, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 30. <HI>Now we are sure that thou
knowest all Things; by this we believe that thou
camest forth from</HI> GOD. A glorious Testimony
indeed, and a Proof that the Disciples were
satisfied in their Belief of his Divinity; and that
he came from God, and was therefore really
and essentially GOD.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Opposers of this Doctrine of the Di∣vinity
of Christ, find out Ways to cavil off the
Weight and Force of all the several Texts of Scrip∣ture
which attest it, and confront them with other
Texts, where Christ himself seems to divest him∣self
of the Glory of it; such as, <HI>My Father is greater
than I,</HI> such a Thing knows no Man, no, the not
Son, but the Father,—and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may cavil these Things off to them∣selves;
but they can never be able to convince us
that we should not distinguish between those Texts,
where he speaks of himself in the first Person of
what he appeared to them to be, and when he speaks
of himself in the third Person of what he was be∣fore,
or is to be hereafter, and of what others testi∣fying
of him, he accepts as his due.</P>
<P>It is manifest, that in all those Texts where
he lessens and diminishes himself, he speaks of him∣self
in his Station or Person of Mediator, <HI>John viii.
20. A Man that hath told you the Truth. John x.
29. My Father is greater than I.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="313"/>
But when he comes to speak of himself in the Per∣son
of what he was or shall be, he owns his Glory,
and who he is; <HI>I and the Father are one; I am in the
Father, and the Father in me; Before</HI> Abraham <HI>was</HI>
I AM, <HI>Joh.</HI> viii. 58. and as before in the same Chapter,
ver. 40. he had only said, <HI>A Man that hath told you
the Truth;</HI> in the same Epistle, Chap. xiv. 6. he
says of himself, <HI>I am the Truth and the Life;</HI> and
who can say this but GOD, who is Truth itself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, and take it so, indeed, that this is an
open Avowing his Divinity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you shall have it more plainly from his
own Mouth; see that eminent Passage when our
blessed Lord was insolently interrogated and adjur'd
by the High Priests in their Judgment-Hall, <HI>Mark</HI>
xiv. 61, 62. after many Impertinencies and Insults,
to which the meek Sacrifice, the Lamb of God, an∣swered
nothing; the High-Priest ask'd him, with a
haughty Air (St. <HI>Matthew</HI> says adjur'd him by the
Living God) Art thou the Christ the Son of the
Blessed? He answers directly, I AM; and how do
the High-Priests understand this Answer, but to
mean that he was God? See <HI>ver. 64. Ye have heard
the Blasphemy:</HI> It could not be Blasphemy to say
he was Christ, unless Christ had been understood to
be God; or to call himself the <HI>Son of God,</HI> if to be
so had not been to be GOD; and so the <HI>Jews</HI> un∣derstood
it when they took up Stones to stone
him, <HI>John</HI> x. 36, 38.</P>
</SP>
<P>It is evident, that Christ there asserted his Divi∣nity,
and that the <HI>Jews</HI> in both those Places under∣stood
him so; for in one Place they took up Stones
to stone him, <HI>ver. 33. for Blasphemy, and that thou,
being a Man, makest thy self</HI> GOD: And in the other,
for Blasphemy, when they hurry'd him to his Cru∣cifixion;
the Crimes were the same as understood by
them, and the Words were the same (<HI>viz.) That
he was the Christ the Son of the Blessed;</HI> and how
<PB N="300" REF="314"/>
could it be Blasphemy to say he was the Son of God,
if the Meaning had not been to make himself God,
I think the Thing is plain, and the Consequence
natural.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess 'tis clear to me, after the most
impartial Thinking over every Branch of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Son, as Christ says of himself, <HI>John</HI>
x. 28. speaking of Believers as of Sheep following
him, who was the good Shepherd, <HI>I give unto them eter∣nal
Life: Can a Man give eternal Life!</HI> Can a Man
lay down his Life for the Sins of other Men? Can the
Life of a Man be a Ransom for the World? Is there
any one Scripture that intimates a Parity? He is in∣deed
called our High-Priest entering into the Holy of
Holies, by Way of Allusion to the Annual Atone∣ment,
and as an Explanation of the Type and the
Thing typify'd; but it was the Divine Person of
Christ alone, which could make an Equality or Pro∣portion
between the Type and the thing typify'd,
and could make the Price paid be equal to the
Purchase.</P>
</SP>
<P>Now 'tis plain, Christ says of himself, 1. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he gives eternal Life. 2. That he lays down, or gives
his Life a Ransom. John</HI> iii. 17. 'Tis said, <HI>God <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
him into the World, that the World through him might
be saved.</HI> Could the World be saved through the
Intercession of a Man! Again, <HI>He is the Propiti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion
for our Sins; and not for our Sins only, but for
the Sins of the whole World, 1 John</HI> ii. 2.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will allow that he might be all this▪
and yet be but a Man; as <HI>Aaron</HI> the High-Priest
made an Atonement by Sacrifice for the Sins of the
People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As those Sacrifices were a Type of the Great
Sacrifice to be offered up, it might be adequate to the
Purpose for which they were intended; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
manifest they were no otherwise accepted in Atone∣ment,
but as they look'd to, and caused the <HI>Israelit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="301" REF="315"/>
to look to the great Propitiation, the Messiah which
was to come, and in the Faith of whom all the be∣lieving
<HI>Jews</HI> were saved; the Blood of Beasts being
no other than Types of that Blood which was ap∣pointed
to be the great Propitiation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tho' this is true, and we believe it all, yet
these Men say 'tis all dark and supposititious, and
that it proves nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what it proves; 1. It proves by the
universal Consent of the Scripture, that Christ is the
promised Messiah; and the same Scripture proves
that the Messiah was to be the Son of God; nay, was
to be really and essentially God; this is clear by all
the Prophesies of the Old Testament, and by the
fulfilling those Promises in the New.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would argue well against the <HI>Jews,</HI>
who neither believe him to be the <HI>Messiah,</HI> or that
the <HI>Messiah</HI> is yet come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would confute and confound both the Infi∣del
<HI>Jews</HI> and the Infidel <HI>Arians</HI> too, if they were
not hardened beyond the Power of Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not be unprofitable, Sir, if we
were informed of those Points too, for the <HI>Jews</HI>
do not allow the Godhead and Deity of the <HI>Messiah,</HI>
any more than the Hereticks do the Divinity of
Christ, and seem to go both upon the same Prin∣ciple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I cannot say 'tis from the same Prin∣ciple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, the <HI>Jews</HI> own all the glorious Things
that can be said of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> when he shall come;
but they will not acknowledge that this is he; while
the <HI>Arians</HI> will grant that this is he, that Christ is
the <HI>Messiah;</HI> but then they abate the Lustre of his
Divinity, take off the Dignity of his Person, and
look upon him to be far less in his Personal Glory,
than the <HI>Jews</HI> allow the <HI>Messiah</HI> shall be when he
comes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="303" REF="316"/>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would furnish us, Sir, to talk with both
of them; for you know we are often at Mr. <HI>De Costa</HI>'s,
and some other <HI>Jews,</HI> who, except their Religion,
we like very well to converse with, and should en∣ter
into Talk with them, if we were able to manage
it; but they are too full of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> for us:
we can do nothing with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first Question, Child, which you have
to ask any <HI>Jews</HI> about the <HI>Messiah,</HI> is to ask them,
What they mean by the <HI>Messiah?</HI> what he was to
be? and how they knew there was any such Person
to come into the World?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know but one Answer they have to give
to such a Question; and that is, That all the Scrip∣tures
of the Old Testament speak of him, describe
his Person and his Glory; that all the Prophets
predict his Coming; and some of them even point
out the Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, that is their Answer, and it is
a sufficient Answer; 'tis sufficient to justify their Ex∣pectation
of such a Person, and their Faith in all
that was predicted concerning him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and our Answer is taken from the
same: It is true, that the Scripture, that is, the Old
Testament, is full of the Prophesies of the <HI>Messiah,</HI>
the Description of his Person, the pointing out the
Time, the Particulars, and the Event of his Com∣ing;
and I add, there is not one of all those Pre∣dictions
but what is fulfilled in the Person and Ap∣pearing
of Jesus Christ; all the Descriptions of his
Person center in the Person of Christ; and the Times,
the Particulars, and the Event of his Coming, all
meet in the appearing of Christ in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, the <HI>Messiah</HI> seems to be the Object of the
whole Scripture Writing, and of all the most consi∣derable
Transactions pointed out there; in particular,
it seems to be the main End and Design of the
whole Old Testament.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="302" REF="317"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so; there's not an eminent Action, or
Person, but is one way or other a Type or Repre∣sentation
of the Messiah; not a Prophesy, but one
way or other relates to him; not a History, but one
way or other points to him; let us observe some of
them.</P>
</SP>
<P>The first of all, and which is almost as ancient as
the Creation, or, at least, as the Fall of Man, was,
that where God, for the Consolation of poor peni∣tent
<HI>Adam</HI> and his <HI>Wife,</HI> our first Parents, assures
them of a Remedy for their Defection, and for the
Entail of Rebellion upon their Race; and that <HI>the
Seed of the Woman should break the Serpent's Head.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, indeed, is the Sum and Substance of
Gospel Grace, the Foundation of all Faith, upon
which the glorious Establishment of Redemption is
founded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, all the Mystery of our Faith is con∣tained
in this Prophesy; and tho' it is like the Seed
that is retained in the Nature of a Plant, or as the
Principles of a large Tree is retained in its Fruit, yet
as it is in the Case of the Seed or Fruit, being bu∣ried
in the Earth, the Principles revive, and in the
Course of Time, produce its Kind; so God has, in
Consequence of that dormant Prophesy, happily
brought other Prophesies upon the Stage, which
have pointed out the Certainty, and even the Time,
and the Particulars of the Birth and Production of
that promised Seed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, Sir, you mean those Prophesies
which afterwards directed his People which Way to
look for the Accomplishment of that Promise, and
from what Part of the World he should proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do so, as particularly to <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Sa∣viour
which is promised to <HI>Adam,</HI> under the Title of
the <HI>Seed of the Woman</HI> is, particularly promised again
to <HI>Abraham;</HI> and that the <HI>Messiah</HI> should come out
<PB N="304" REF="318"/>
of his Loins, <HI>In thy Seed shall all the Nations of the
Earth be blessed.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed, I never observed before; but
it was a great while before any Thing of it came to
pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How backward, how tedious was the
Performance, and yet how punctually did Heaven
bring it to pass!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so, indeed, <HI>Abraham</HI> had but one Son
<HI>Isaac,</HI> and not that till he was a Hundred Years old:
<HI>Isaac</HI> went Forty Years Childless; and when he had
Children, it wanted but a little that <HI>Jacob,</HI> on whom
the promised Seed was entailed, had been murthered
by his Brother: But he escaping, and the Blessing
going along with <HI>Jacob,</HI> by the express Command
of God, yet he fled into Bondage and Misery, and
endured it Twenty Years.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Jacob</HI> has Twelve Sons, and yet as he possess'd the
Birth-right and the Promise, notwithstanding he had
not the Primogeniture, but was the youngest Son;
so God thought fit to pass by Three of his Sons, and
fix upon <HI>Judah,</HI> the Fourth Son, to be the Source
of the Royal Seed, and the Line of the Promise.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are all Tokens, that however the
Promise was delay'd, it should certainly be punctual∣ly
fulfilled, and the Seed be preserved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it was more remote still; it was above
Six hundred Years after this, that <HI>God,</HI> reviving the
Mention of the chosen Seed, names the very Tribe
and Family; nay, the little Village where he should
be born.</P>
</SP>
<P>Several of the Prophesies mark out the Time of
his Coming; one in particular, namely, <HI>Jacob,</HI> say<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
expresly, the Scepter shall first depart from <HI>Juda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI>
and that all the Nation of <HI>Israel</HI> shall lose the So∣vereignty
of their own Government, <HI>Gen.</HI> xlix. 10▪
According to another, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was to fall into the
Hands of her conquering Enemies, who should be∣siege
<PB N="305" REF="319"/>
and take it, <HI>Micha</HI> v. 12. according to others,
the second Temple was to be in Being when the
Messiah should appear in the World, <HI>Haggai</HI> ii. 9.
<HI>Matt.</HI> iii. 1. And the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> in particular,
has mark'd out the very Time when the <HI>Messiah</HI>
shall come.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very Time, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, precisely, <HI>Dan.</HI> ix. 24. to the End of
the Chapter; pray look the Place and read it, the
Words are express, and they have been fulfilled in
Point of Time to a Day.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[She reads as follows.]</STAGE>
<P>Seventy Weeks are determined upon thy People, and
upon thy Holy City, to finish the Transgression, and to
make an End of Sins, and to make Reconciliation for
Iniquity, and, to bring in everlasting Righteousness, and
to seal up the Vision and Prophecy, and to anoint the
most Holy. Know therefore and understand, that from
the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to
build <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be
Seven Weeks; and Threescore and Two Weeks the
Street shall be built again, and the Wall, even in
troublous Times. And after Threescore and Two
Weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself:
And the People of the Prince that shall come, shall de∣stroy
the City and the Sanctuary, and the End thereof
shall be with a Flood, and unto the End of the War
Desolations are determined. And he shall confirm the
Covenant with many for one Week: And in the midst of
the Week he shall cause the Sacrifice and the Oblation to
cease, and for the overspreading of Abominations he
shall make it desolate, even until the Consummation,
and that determined shall be poured upon the Deso∣late.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how is this Time made out, Sir? I do
not understand that Part so well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="306" REF="320"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not so much to the present Case: I
should come to it in Time; but however, you may
observe it, I shall tell you presently more particularly
how it is made out; but let me go on with the
Prophesies. In the first Place, <HI>God,</HI> in Mercy to his
Church, and for the Support of their Faith, has
joined to those Prophesies, which were the first
Foundation of their Faith, a continued Chain of
Prophesy, which gives a lively Description of the
Person of the Messiah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was waiting to observe that Part, Sir, be∣cause
you mentioned it before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why first, <HI>Isaiah</HI> speaks of him, as if he had
seen him with his Eyes; the Royal Prophet is full
of him in all his <HI>Psalms;</HI> and 'tis remarkable, that
almost all the Prophets mention the Messiah, not as
that glorious King which the <HI>Jews</HI> expected him to
be, but in these Two particular Articles, <HI>viz.</HI> that of
his Humiliation or Abasement, and that of his Suf∣ferings;
this you may observe in reading the ii,
viii, xvi, xxii, lxix, ci, cx. <HI>Psalms;</HI> but the liii.
Chap. of <HI>Isaiah</HI> is a formal Proof of this Part, where
the Messiah is represented in all the Abasement of
his State of Humiliation; as also in <HI>Zech.</HI> ix. 9
there the Humiliation of the Messiah is fully repre∣sented:
This is certainly done, that in the Ages to
come, when the Church should see this great and glo∣rious
Gift come to Light, yet veil'd in such a parti∣cular
Manner, they might be able to say, <HI>Behold <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Man!</HI> This is the Holy One of God, the Messiah▪
and we cannot look for another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are the Advantages of great Read∣ing
and long Study of the Scriptures; I never div'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
thus far into this glorious Truth; but it is a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and wonderful Discovery of the Glory of the <HI>Mes∣siah,</HI>
that he is so perfectly describ'd, and so set for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
in all the Prophets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="307" REF="321"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what are not our Prejudices capable of?
The <HI>Jews,</HI> who are among those that call Evil
Good, and Good Evil, make all this Light be
Darkness to them; and yet, after all this, expect
still the Coming of the <HI>Messiah;</HI> Light has come in
to their Darkness, and that Darkness comprehendeth it
not. He cried to them at his Coming, <HI>Behold me,
behold me;</HI> but they answered fiercely, <HI>We know
not who thou art.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Radicate Error, grown incurable by
Time, possesses them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their Unbelief goes from Father to Son; and
'tis to them, like a second original Sin, which comes
into the World with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They look for the Messiah still, and with
an unexampled Blindness and Rage they look for
him, upon the Faith of those very ancient Prophe∣sies,
which most evidently confess his being already
come; at the same Time, overthrowing all those
Oracles themselves, by their Unbelief, and making
as if they all contained a Collection of Lyes and
no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They seem to believe that the Messiah is
yet to come, only because they will believe it; with∣out
being able to fix it upon any one Prophesy in
the whole Book of GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes they pretend to find him in those
Words of <HI>Jacob, The Scepter shall not depart from</HI>
Judah, <HI>nor a Law-giver from between his Feet till</HI>
SHILOH <HI>come:</HI> And they use a great deal of Ar∣tifice,
and Criticism to make good this Interpretation
in their Favour; but they cannot bring the sacred
Text to chime in with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think they expect it should.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, one would not, all the Prophesies are
against them; the xiith <HI>Ps.</HI> which they boast of as an
Illustrious Representation of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> is all against
<PB N="308" REF="322"/>
them, and they leave it to us; they strive hard to
stand up against our Exposition of the cxth <HI>Psalm,</HI>
and bring it to their Party, but it will not do; there
is not one Text in <HI>Isaiah</HI> upon which they dare say
<HI>There he is:</HI> When that Evangelick Prophet describes
the Messiah, chap. viii. and says, <HI>Behold a Virgin
shall conceive and shall bring forth a Child, and you
shall call his Name</HI> Immanuel; they will have this
to be understood quite of another Thing than that
which he calls a Messiah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor are they at all the more convinc'd, when
they rate the Words of that Prophet, chap. ix. ver.
5, 6. as the Words of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> tho' there is no
Text in the whole Bible which looks more in their
Favour; because it seems to display his Power and
Grandeur, and sets him not on the Throne of his
Father <HI>David</HI> only, but even on the Throne of GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> are hardened against all kind of
Reasoning; they believe nothing, no not the next
Hour what they said the Hour before; nothing, how∣ever
plain, can convince them: What Shuffling do
they make with the Words of <HI>Jacob, Till Shiloh come?</HI>
Enquiring, <HI>Who is this Shilo,</HI> and what he is to be
or to do? Tho' nothing is plainer than who is meant
by him, by the remarkable Character given of his
Coming, <HI>viz. To him shall the gathering of the Peo∣ple
be.</HI> And particularly it was to be, when the
People of <HI>Israel</HI> were subsisting indeed, but with∣out
the Face of a Government, of a Nation, of a
Civil Polity or State; feeble and faint, without
Power, without a Scepter, without a Legislative
Authority, and left a Prey to the Strongest.</P>
<P>Now let us inquire a little into the present State
and Condition of the <HI>Jews;</HI> It is above 1700 Years
since the <HI>Jews</HI> have ceased to be a People, and that
they have been in the very Condition predicted,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) without a Governor, a Law, or a Law∣giver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="309" REF="323"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must follow then that the <HI>Messiah</HI> has been
come so long, for he cannot be to come now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, above 1700 Years, that is very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the other Prophesies seem to be alike
fulfilled too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the Prophet <HI>Malachi,</HI> and <HI>Haggai,</HI> fore∣told
that the second Temple should be in being at
the Time of the Messiah's Coming; It was built
in the Time of those Prophets, as we may see above;
now 'tis plain that the second Temple has been de∣stroyed
above 1600 Years, and where then is the
<HI>Messiah,</HI> and what is become of the Promise of his
Coming?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must be come before the Destruction of
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nothing can be plainer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must so, unless the Temple had not been
destroyed with the City. But now to conclude,
take the Prophesy of <HI>Daniel of the Seventy Weeks,</HI>
which you enquired about above, and there you
will see every Part of it fully explained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I waited for that Part before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let the Criticks examine this Point with the
utmost Nicety; the Days there, by all Interpreters,
are calculated for Years: Now 70 Weeks is the Time
appointed for the Continuance of the second Tem∣ple,
which is just 490 Days, and just so many Years
was it, from the Edict of <HI>Cyrus</HI> for the Return of the
Captivity, to the Coming of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very exact.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Son, add the Time since lapsed, and
what shall we say then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What indeed! here are above 1700 Years
more passed over, and where is this Messiah? what,
is he not come yet!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what Purpose have all those Pro∣phets
spoken these Things? and what is become of
all those Phophesies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="310" REF="324"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do the <HI>Jews</HI> say to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing shews the Confusion they are in
about it, like the simple, weak, and shuffling An∣swers
they give in the Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not able to guess what they can
have to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, they say, it is their Impenitence that
has caused the <HI>Messiah</HI> to delay his Coming; and
that God had sent him long ago, if they had not
been unworthy to receive so glorious a Gift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be a good Reason indeed to
them, but 'tis no Reason why God should omit ful∣filling
his sacred and solemn Promises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all an Illusion; will they tell us that
when God promised to the <HI>Jews</HI> that the <HI>Messiah</HI>
should certainly come at such a Time, he did
not know how unworthy they would be to receive
him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that they should be exceedingly cor∣rupted
and degenerated, hardened, and impeni∣tent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Daniel</HI> says expressly, <HI>It shall be in a Time
of the overspreading of Abominations,</HI> Dan. ix. 27.
the Prophet <HI>Zechariah,</HI> and the Prophet <HI>Malachi,</HI>
say the same Thing, or to the same Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, pray, where is it said expressly,
that the <HI>Messiah</HI> shall come during the Continuance
of the second Temple? for a great deal seems to de∣pend
upon that Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look your Bible, Child, and read the first
Verse of the Third Chapter of <HI>Malachi.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is indeed, [She looks the Place,
and reads it with a kind of Surprize.] <HI>The Lord
whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple:</HI>
And here is a Prophesy of <HI>John</HI> the Baptist coming
too, [She reads that too, <HI>Behold I will send my
Messenger, and he shall prepare the Way before me</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="325"/>
Mal. iii. 1.] which confirms its Meaning to be of
Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but look again, see the Prophet <HI>Hag∣gai;</HI>
he was alive at the Building of the Second
Temple, and prophesied and preached to the
Builders of it to encourage them, when their Hearts
failed them, and when they mourned at the Sight
of what it was like to be, compared to the first
glorious House which they had seen; and he tells
them the Glory of this Second Temple, however
mean it appeared, should be greater than that of the
first: See the Place, Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Here it is, Sir,</HI> Haggai <HI>ii.</HI> 7, 8, 9. [She
reads the Words.] And I will shake all Nations,
and the Desire of all Nations shall come, and I will fill
this House with Glory, saith the Lord of Hosts. The
Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, saith the Lord
of Hosts. The Glory of this latter House shall be
greater than of the former, saith the Lord of Hosts:
and in this Place will I give Peace, saith the Lord of
Hosts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is this Glory of the second House?
it is evident it was not in the Riches or Beauty of
the Building, for in that the first House always ex∣ceeded
it, but it was in that the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to en∣ter
into it, as above. <HI>I will fill this House with Glory,</HI>
and in this Place I will give Peace, for <HI>the Lord shall
suddenly come to his Temple.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Christ did come while the
Temple was standing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Simeon</HI> took him in his Arms in the
Temple, and gave Glory to God; he blessed God,
declaring, <HI>That his Eyes had seen his Salvation,</HI> that
is his <HI>Messiah,</HI> the SHILOH promised, as you may
read <HI>Luke</HI> ii. 28, 29.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="312" REF="326"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now the Temple is not standing, and
the <HI>Jews</HI> say the <HI>Messiah</HI> is not yet come; How will
they say these Prophesies are to be fulfilled? 'Tis
plain the Prophesies can never be fulfilled now, for
the second Temple is gone, nor can it be that the
Impenitence of the <HI>Jews</HI> could hinder the Per∣formance
of God's Promises: It is certain therefore
the Promise has been fulfilled; it must be, that
the Messiah must have been come, because the
second Temple, which he was to enter into, is de∣stroyed
and gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But besides; pray, <HI>Son,</HI> remember and ob∣serve
them: It's certain the Messiah is not delayed
or denied for the Wickedness of the <HI>Jews,</HI> unless
they would revive the old weak Opinion of the
Pharisees, and pretend that Christ was to come for
the Salvation of the <HI>Jews</HI> only; <HI>the Messiah</HI> is pro∣mised
for the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the Nations that are afar of,
and to be given for the Salvation of all the Ends
of the Earth; And can they pretend his Coming
to be delay'd now for above Seventeen Hundred
Years for the Impenitence of the <HI>Jews</HI> only! It is
a preposterous thing, and absurd beyond any one's
Patience to bear, that the <HI>Jews</HI> should arrogate the
Effects of the Messiah's Death all to themselves,
when he so often has been declared to be a Propi∣tiation
for the Sins of the whole World; And are
the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and all the Nations of the World, for
whom he is thus to be a Propitiation, to be de∣prived
of the Advantage of it, be shut out of the
Church, be without Hope, and without God in the
World, till it shall please the <HI>Jews</HI> to repent and
turn to God, and be more worthy of the promised
Salvation? they must be utterly ignorant of the
Ways of God, and have very little Acquaintance
with the Scriptures and Prophesies contained in
them, who can entertain such Notions as these,
<PB N="313" REF="327"/>
which, under Pretence of doing Honour to the
Justice and Holiness of God, overthrow the Truth
of his Word, the Faith of Scripture Prophesies, and
shut the Door against the Conversion of so many
Millions of Souls which the Messiah came to save,
and which he was sent to save.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can the <HI>Jews</HI> say to this Part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly they have nothing to say to it; but as
they first hardened themselves against the Belief of
the Thing it self, they seem bound to support their
own Obstinacy, and to shut their Eyes against all their
own Prophets; those very Prophets, which at other
Times, and on all other Occasions, they are ready
to acknowledge to be true Prophets, and Men of
God; such as <HI>Daniel, Haggai, Malachi,</HI> and even
the good Patriarch and Prophet <HI>Jacob</HI> himself,
and several others, all of them having agreed in
setting down the Time of the Coming of the
Messiah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Sign of a terrible judicial Obsti∣nacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can they read those Prophesies, with∣out
seeing it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have a Way for that too; they say
they are dark, and spoken by way of Parables, and
to avoid their being explained to their Conviction,
they forbid People to meddle with casting up the
Time of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s coming, as a Secret not to
be looked into, and as those People are always very
obstinate in their Prejudices, they pronounce <HI>a
Curse</HI> upon those that <HI>make Calculations of the Times
and Seasons.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why are they afraid to look back and
calculate the Times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose for fear they should find it out,
and that the same Person, who we call our Savi∣our,
should appear to be their Messiah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="314" REF="328"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the Case indeed; let me state it in
the most familiar Terms possible, that the very
Children may understand it: If we will but look
back a little, and marking first the Time of the
Messiah's coming, as predicted in the Scripture,
and then examining the History of what happened
at that Time in the World; these two Enquiries
would bring it all upon the Stage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; that they would find
the Person of our Saviour, and the Time of the
Coming of the Messiah, agree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us observe it, a little critically, how the
Concurrence of the Prophets appeared, and how
Things stood in the World about that Time: Just
at the End of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Commonwealth, when
the Scepter was just departing from <HI>Judah,</HI> while
the second Temple, though near its Destruction,
was yet standing, and the very Year when the
Seventy Weeks mention'd in the Prophesy of <HI>Da∣niel</HI>
were accomplished, namely, the 490th Year
after the Return of the Captivity, just at that
very Time, would the <HI>Jews</HI> look back upon it,
they would find one <HI>JESUS</HI> walking up and down
in the Land of <HI>Judea;</HI> the Son of one <HI>Mary,</HI> di∣rectly
descended of the Family of <HI>David,</HI> and born
at the little City of <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> his said Mother re∣puted
a Virgin though espoused, and having never
known Man; all particularly predicted of the
<HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>This JESUS, (supposing them not to know him by
the Particulars of his Birth, and the Concurrence of
the Predictions of the <HI>Messiah</HI>) yet makes himself
appear to be something wonderful in his Person; by
the Holiness of his Life, his Zeal for God, and
the Doctrine which he preached; his very Enemies
confessing, <HI>That never Man spoke as he spoke; and
were astonished at his Doctrine, for he taught as one
having Authority.</HI></P>
<SP>
<PB N="315" REF="329"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very remarkable indeed, and I never
considered it before, how exactly Christ came at
that very Time that the Messiah was promised to
come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain those that understood Scripture
Prophesies, knew the Time of his Coming could
not be far of, and expected it: It is said of se∣veral
Persons, that they waited for him; <HI>Joseph</HI> of
<HI>Arimathea</HI> waited for the Kingdom of God; <HI>Simeon</HI>
waited for the Consolation of <HI>Israel,</HI> and <HI>Anna</HI>
the Prophetess spake of him to those that looked
for Redemption in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> which intimate
that many did so look for this Redemption at that
Time.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It could not well be otherwise, where any Peo∣ple
had read the Scripture, and compar'd one Pro∣phesy
with another; but I come to the Concurrence
of Particulars in the Person and Coming of Christ,
with the Predictions of the Scripture concerning the
<HI>Messiah.</HI> There appeared, I say, at that very
Time, one JESUS, holy in Life, wonderful in Doc∣trine;
one JESUS, whose Conversation was a Pat∣tern
of Meekness, Patience, and Humility; one
JESUS, whose whole Business, nay, his Meat and
Drink, was to advance the Honour of God, and
do good to all his Creatures; giving himself no Rest,
but travelling from Place to Place, from House to
House, and from City to City, doing good, and
every where leaving surprizing Testimonies of a
heavenly Disposition, as well as of an infinite and
supernatural Power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wonderfully compassionate to the Poor, and
patient under the Insults even of the provoking
Pharisees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But come to his Beneficence and his Omni∣potence:
Here he cures a Leper, there he delivers
a Demoniac (or one possessed with the <HI>Devil</HI>); in
<PB N="316" REF="330"/>
one Place he gives Sight to the Blind, and to one
that was born so; a poor Paralytick, that had been
a Cripple Eight and Thirty Years, he heals with a
Word, <HI>Rise up,</HI> says he, to the poor Creature,
and immediately the Man, immoveable before, and
laid at length upon his sorry Mattress, or perhaps
a Bundle of Straw, starts up, stands upright, walks
about, and all the City of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> sees him at
the Feet of his Deliverer, glorifying God for his
Recovery, and are Witnesses of the Miracle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a Surprize to the whole City to
be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another Time he comes to <HI>Nain,</HI> and meets
a Funeral, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Of a poor Youth, the only Son
of his Mother, carrying to his Grave: Pity moves
the compassionate JESUS, who came <HI>to seek</HI> and <HI>to
save.</HI> Hold, says he, to the Bearer, and coming
to the Corps, <HI>Young Man,</HI> says he, <HI>arise:</HI> Imme∣diately
the Corps revives, sits up, speaks, and is
restored to his Mother. Another Time, coming to
<HI>Bethany,</HI> he finds his Friend <HI>Lazarus</HI> dead and bu∣ried,
and all the Family in Tears; he bids them
shew him where they had laid him, and though it
was in a deep Vault, a large Cave, according to
the Usage of the Country; Here, though he had
been dead Four Days, and was supposed to be a pu∣trified
Carcass, yet his Voice penetrates the Cavern:
<HI>Lazarus,</HI> COME FORTH, says the Omnipotent in car∣nated
God! The dead Corps revives, the Coffin
opens, and he comes stalking out of the Grave, to
the Amazement of all the Beholders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are strange Things, 'tis true, and
no Doubt but they were so then; I cannot think
but the People were terribly frightened when they
saw him come out; I believe I should have sunk
into the very Ground, or to it at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="317" REF="331"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who is this <HI>Jesus!</HI> What does the
World think of him, a Man that does so many
strange surprizing Things, so many Miracles!
Whence is he, and what can he be! Every Body
wonders, every Body is astonished, the Eyes of all
<HI>Israel</HI> is upon him, and every now and then the
People, whose Minds were not blinded, and in Sla∣very
to the Opinions of their Doctors, would
break out, in the Amazement of their Souls, at
those Things, in such Expressions as these; Lord!
Is not this the Messiah? Is not this the Christ?
When the Messiah comes, can he do more Mira∣cles
than these? sure this must be the Christ the Sa∣viour
of the World! Some did speak thus openly of
him; and 'tis plain these were the Sentiments of
abundance more, though they durst not speak them
openly, for fear of the Magistrates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, such was <HI>Nicodemus, Joseph,</HI> and many
more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But JESUS was not without Witness; the
Blind Man reproaches them boldly with it; What,
<HI>says he,</HI> do ye ask whence he is, yet he has opened
my Eyes? Can any thing but God open the Eyes
of one born Blind? Was it ever known in the
World? And do you not know, that if he was not
of God, he could not do any thing? Astonishing
Blindness in those that had Eyes, and astonishing
Boldness in him that was born Blind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they cast him out for it, like some Mo∣dern
Church Powers, and what they cannot confute
they will persecute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Miracle of their Obstinacy does not
end here; the Blind Man proclaims him, but it is
not sufficient; What does he say himself? he tells
them plainly <HI>I am he,</HI> I am the Messiah, and if you
will not believe my Words, believe my Works; be∣lieve
my Miracles, and if on both these Testimo∣nies,
<PB N="318" REF="332"/>
as well Words as Works, <HI>ye believe not,</HI> he adds
the Commination, <HI>Ye shall die in your Sins.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Article of Christ's Miracles is very con∣vincing;
I think he might well say, <HI>Believe me for
the Works sake.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are some Particulars attending the Mi∣racles
of Jesus Christ, which are very observable,
and which render them more conspicuous than any
of those performed by the Prophets.</P>
<P>1. 'Tis very remarkable, that to make the <HI>Jews</HI>
the more attentive to the Miracles of Jesus
Christ in particular, the Wisdom of God
thought fit to put a kind of a Stop to the
Working of Miracles in general, for above Five
Hundred Years, immediately before Christ;
even <HI>John</HI> the Baptist wrought no Miracles,
though he was so universally received and
applauded, and all <HI>Judea</HI> ran after him;
it seemed too much that the Servant, who was
so near his Master's coming, should act in the
same Method.</P>
<P>2. The Miracles that followed after Christ's Time,
and which were done by the Apostles, were
rather the Miracles of Christ himself, than their
own, and were all acted in his Name, and by
his Power working in them.</P>
<P>Now can any one think, God would bring all
these concurring Particulars, and all the true Cha∣racters
of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> to meet in one Person, and
yet this Person not to be the <HI>Messiah?</HI> the Time,
the Birth, the exemplary holy Life, the Wisdom,
the Doctrine, the Miracles, all joining together
with the Predictions; and not one Tittle of all that
had been foretold of him failing to come exactly
and punctually to pass; and yet that this <HI>should not
<PB N="319" REF="333"/>
be he that should come,</HI> but that we <HI>must look for
another.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must be the true Messiah, or one of the
greatest Deceivers and Impostors that ever was in
the World; I can see no room for any thing
else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I come therefore to the Testimony he gives
of himself by Word and by Miracle. This <HI>Jesus</HI>
declares himself to be the <HI>Messiah,</HI> on every Occa∣sion,
and in one Place tells them expressly, If ye
believe not that I am he, <HI>ye shall die in your Sins.</HI>
To convince them of the Truth of it, he works
innumerable Miracles, and those such as, it was
evident, had no Fraud or Illusion in them, and
could not be done to deceive; that had for Wit∣nesses
only as many as the Country of <HI>Judea,</HI> and
<HI>Galilee,</HI> and all the neighbouring Provinces had In∣habitants,
and yet this Man is not to be believed;
God is too jealous of his Glory to set his Seal to a
Deceiver and Impostor, and that of the greatest and
worst Kind, as this must be, if it was so at all,
and if Jesus Christ is not the true Messiah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miracles were always taken for a Confirma∣tion
of the Truth of any Doctrine, and of the
Authority of the Preacher too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, <HI>Moses</HI> is an admirable Example
of it; he was known all over <HI>Egypt</HI> to be the true
Messenger of God, by the Miracles which he wrought
there; nay, he was empowered to work those Mi∣racles
purely to obtain his Admittance, and to be
believed as a true Messenger of God, and not only
the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but even his own People first re∣ceived
him, and acknowledg'd him as such on that
very Account: They did the same Justice to all
the other Prophets after him on the very same Ac∣count,
and according to the Degrees, and the Num∣bers
of those Miracles, they were valued and re∣ceiv'd;
And is there none then but JESUS that is
<PB N="320" REF="334"/>
not to be believed! Certainly the <HI>Jews</HI> are very
unhappy in their particular Malice against Christ as
the Messiah, in that they cannot deny him this
Justice, without openly exposing the Honour of
their own Prophets: And refusing to acknowledge
Christ to be the Messiah, after such an innumera∣ble
Multitude of Miracles of every Kind, is a formal
Accusation of their Fore-fathers, and of the whole
<HI>Israelitish</HI> Church, for having believed lightly, and
upon the Authority of some few Miracles only, all
the Patriarchs and Prophets, such as <HI>Moses, Jo∣shua,
Samuel,</HI> and others, to be the true Ministers
of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it seems as if God had then dropt the
Authority or Testimony of the Prophets on this
Occasion, had made those very <HI>Jews,</HI> who are the
Subject of our Contempt, and even Judaism itself,
to become the principal Rampart of the Christian
Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Deceit lay much of it in the first Delu∣sion
of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation; they expected and
hoped for a glorious <HI>Messiah,</HI> a particular <HI>Messiah</HI>
or King, that should restore their Kingdom, and
should appear at the Head of a great Army; rich,
gay, potent, and victorious; that should deliver
their Country from the <HI>Roman</HI> Yoke, and make
the Name of the <HI>Jews</HI> the Terror of the World;
whereas this <HI>Jesus</HI> appeared in a quite contrary Fi∣gure;
poor, abject, and mean, who, 'till he was
Thirty Years old, dwelt in an obscure Retreat, in
the House of a Carpenter, and when he came
abroad in the World, was attended only by a few
poor Fishermen of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who he gathered together
upon the Lake there. In his Behaviour, so meek,
and so humble, that, as the Text says, He suffered
not his Voice to be heard in the Streets; and when
the People, ravished and surprized with the Power
and Energy of his Preaching, and with the Won∣ders
<PB N="321" REF="335"/>
of his Miracles, would have made him a King,
he withdrew from them into a secret Place: His
Doctrine was the same, he preached nothing but
Repentance, Humility, Meekness, Peace, Union,
and the Love of our Enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> might well, indeed, be stumbled
and offended, it was a great Disappointment to them
to be sure, and they contemned him accordingly; on
that very Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why should they be so? Was it not the
very Description given of the <HI>Messiah</HI> by the Pro∣phets,
see <HI>Isaiah lii. 14. As many were astonied at
thee; (his Visage was so marred more than any Man,
and his Form more than the Sons of Men.</HI>) Psalm
cix. 22. <HI>For I am poor and needy, and my Heart is
wounded within me.</HI> Zech. ix. 9. <HI>Rejoyce greatly, O
Daughter of</HI> Zion, <HI>shout, O Daughter of</HI> Jerusalem:
<HI>behold, thy King cometh unto thee: He is just, and
having Salvation, lowly, and riding upon an Ass,
and upon a Colt the Foal of an Ass.</HI> All these Texts
the <HI>Jews</HI> had read, and many more, in their
Prophets; but they would not have them belong to
the Messiah, or would they own the Marks when
visible in Jesus Christ; but they would have it be
that GOD should send them a Saviour according to
their own Notions, rather than according to what
he himself promised and described.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see plainer into this than ever I did;
the low Condition of the Messiah was an Offence to
them to be sure, and blinded them, and they could
not see him, or know him if they did see him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let us take the same Method in exa∣mining
the Particular of the <HI>Messiah</HI> after his Death;
see there the Effect of their rejecting him, and how
all Things that he foretold them came to pass: He
threatened them, that for their refusing him, and
not knowing in their Days the Things of their
Peace, <HI>their House should be left unto them desolate,</HI>
<PB N="322" REF="336"/>
and they should be delivered up to the Sword of
their Enemies; that <HI>Judea</HI> should be made a la∣mentable
Scene of all the Horror and Miseries of
War; that <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should be besieg'd, taken,
sack'd, and demolish'd to its very Foundations;
the Temple should be overturned, and not one Stone
left upon another that should not be thrown down;
and a great many such like, all which came to
pass in less than Forty Years after the Death of
Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, the Judgment of God seems to pursue
them to this Day, while they are scattered over the
Face of the whole Earth, and the Wrath of God
seems still to abide upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the mean time this <HI>Jesus</HI> then passing
through the State of his Humiliation, is now ex∣alted,
<HI>the Stone which the Builders rejected</HI> is <HI>become
the Head of the Corner;</HI> he reigns through the whole
Earth, and his Name is adored from the rising of
the Son to the going down of the same: His
Gospel is preached from the one End of the Earth
to the other: The Idols of the Heathen are con∣founded,
<HI>Dagon</HI> is fallen down before him, the
<HI>Gentiles</HI> are converted, and while the Synagogue
alone continues obstinate, according to the <HI>Pro∣phesies
of the Scripture,</HI> and refuses to recognize the
Lord Jesus to be the Messiah, the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who
they despised as Outcasts, bow down to his Domi∣nion,
and reverence his Authority, according to the
same Scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do the <HI>Jews</HI> say to all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, What can they say? Can they deny
that this great Event of the Calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
and the Downfal of Idolatry and Paganism, have
been noted by the Prophets as a proper Token of
the Coming of the <HI>Messiah?</HI> that GOD promised to
<HI>Abraham,</HI> that in his Seed, which is the <HI>Messiah,</HI> all
the Nations of the Earth should be blessed; that
<PB N="323" REF="337"/>
<HI>Jacob</HI> said of him, That <HI>to him should the Gather∣ing
of the People be?</HI> Have they not read what <HI>Moses</HI>
says, <HI>Deut. xxxii. 22. I will provoke you to Jealousy
by a People which are not a People?</HI> Have they not
read the Second <HI>Psalm,</HI> where God promises to the
<HI>Messiah, Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen
for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost Parts of the
Earth for thy Possession,</HI> and innumerable other Places
which I might mention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they have read all these Scriptures we
know, but do they understand them to belong to
Jesus Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They understand them to belong to the
<HI>Messiah;</HI> all their Writers acknowledge it, and
our Saviour quoting many of those Texts to them
concerning himself, appeals to them as understand∣ing
them so: They told him, in one Place, That
<HI>Elias must first come,</HI> and he tells them <HI>Elias,</HI> which
was <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, <HI>was already come;</HI> and in
many Places 'tis evident that by the Light of Scrip∣ture
Prophesies, and the Calculation of Events, they
themselves believed that the Messiah was at Hand,
and that he was expected about that Time; but
they would not believe that this was so, and this
Unbelief was their Overthrow and Destruction, and
is so to this Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis plain they are deluded, but they are
given up to it, and hardened in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are so, and are like to continue so till
a supernatural Light shall overcome that Darknes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪
and they shall be called in such a Manner as they shall
not be able to resist; and for that Day we all wait
and pray, believing that still, according to the
Scripture, <HI>Salvation is</HI> of the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE Father, who is here called, very just∣ly,
<HI>The Instructor</HI> of his <HI>Family,</HI> was very
well pleased with the Occasion which his Daughter
gave him to enter into the Dispute about the
Lord Jesus Christ being the <HI>Messiah,</HI> as also of the
<HI>Messiah</HI> being already come; as it is opposed to
the Obstinacy of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who expect a Messiah
yet to come, and deny that Jesus, who is alrea∣dy
come, is the Messiah. His Daughter desired
to have these Things set in a clear View to her,
not that she did not already believe them, but
being acquainted with some <HI>Jews</HI> Ladies, and
having frequent Occasion to be among them, and
hear them talk of these Things, she desired to make
her self Mistress of such Arguments as, on any Oc∣casion
of Discourse, might best defend her own
Principles, and confute theirs; and of the same Use,
I hope, it may be to others, to have these Argu∣ments
repeated in this Place.</P>
<P>But their Father had another View in it also,
namely, That having been discoursing before of the
Divinity of Jesus Christ, and how evidently it ap∣peared
by the Testimony of the Scriptures that he
was the Son of God; and that in the full Sense
of that Expression, as he had explained it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
That he was the Lord <HI>Jehovah;</HI> real, very God,
essential and equal with his Father, and that by the
Nature of God, and all the Ideas we are able to
<PB N="325" REF="339"/>
form in our Minds of an infinite indivisible Being,
it can be no otherwise, but that to be the Son of
God, and to come forth from God, must be under∣stood
to be the same as God.</P>
<P>I say, having been discoursing of this, it occurred
most naturally to him, that the Proof from Scrip∣ture
of Christ being the <HI>Messiah</HI> necessarily carried
with it a farther and full Discovery of his Divinity,
and of his eternal Power and <HI>Godhead;</HI> since many
of the Scripture Prophesies of the <HI>Messiah</HI> evidently
demonstrate him to be more than Human, and
join in with the Testimony of his Divinity at the
same Time that they predict his appearing upon
Earth; giving Divine Honours to his Name, to his
Person, and to his Power; testifying, as he says of
himself, that he came forth from God.</P>
<P>As this made him willing to enter into the Scrip∣ture
Evidence of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> so it made him also
bring back the Discourse of the Messiah to the Per∣son
of Christ, as GOD, and as equal with the Father;
Accordingly he told his Daughter, at the Close of
the former Discourse, that having thus sufficiently
furnished her to talk with her Acquaintances
among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to confute all their Cavils
at the Certainty of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s being come,
according to the Text, and that <HI>this was he,</HI> and
that we do not <HI>look for another;</HI> he thought it was
a very good Opportunity to furnish her also, and
her Brother and Sister with Arguments to strengthen
their Faith in the Dignity and Divine Glory of the
Person of the <HI>Messiah;</HI> and to prove to her, that as
the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be more than Man, his Person
Divine and Eternal, his Glory everlasting, and
his Throne for ever and ever; so this Christ, who
is the Messiah, exactly answers to all the Scripture
Prophesies of that Divinity and Glory; as he does
to those of his Office, of his Sufferings for Sin,
<PB N="326" REF="340"/>
of his Humility, and of his being the King and Head
of his Church.</P>
<P>This occasion'd the following Dialogue, wherein
the good Father does not so much engage with the
present Cavils of the Modern Disputants, or their
subtle Evasions of plain Scripture, which testify the
Divinity of Christ founded on the different Read∣ings
of such and such Texts, by which they study
rather to perplex the Debate, than bring it to a Cer∣tainty;
as he does by clear Reasoning upon such Ex∣pressions
as are undisputed and plain References to
Scripture Prophesies of Christ, make it plain that
as Christ must of Necessity be the <HI>Messiah</HI> that
was to come, the <HI>Shiloh</HI> that was promised, the
Seed of the Woman that was to break the Head of
the Serpent; so the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be the Son of
GOD, and that he that is so, is GOD; that he is Eter∣nal,
and Infinite, and Omniscient, and Omnipotent,
that he acted on Earth with Divine Authority, assert∣ed
his Divine Original, and has in Scripture Divine
Honours paid him.</P>
<P>In order to introduce this great Head of Argu∣ment,
he takes an Occasion one Evening, when his
Daughter seemed to be bringing on some Discourse
of much less Consequence, to turn her off from it
thus.</P>
<P>My Dear, we have discoursed fully upon the
Subject of Christ being the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> and
that this <HI>Messiah</HI> is really and actually COME, accord∣ing
as was foretold by the Prophets, and also at the
very Time it was foretold; I hope you are able to
maintain that Cause now against your <HI>Jews</HI> Ladies
with whom you are acquainted.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I am, Sir; I think it is very
clear, at least it is so to me, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa▪</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I must bring this Argument a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> farther, for I have not done with it yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="327" REF="341"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it was indeed over, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, No, I think 'tis evident, from the same
Scripture Prophesies, or at least from many of them,
that he (Jesus Christ) is the Son of GOD, in the most
glorious Sense as I described it; so that the Messiah
was to be the Son of God, and that he is really and
truly GOD, as really as he is the Messiah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be glad to see it made out by Ar∣guments,
Sir, for they cavil at all Things which the
Scripture says concerning it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, Child, I cannot agree, that be∣cause
the Opposers, who we may truly call, as the
Popish Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> called Bishop <HI>Ridly, Haeres Here∣ticissime
Heretice,</HI> cavil at all that is said in the Scrip∣ture
of the Divinity of Christ, and therefore we
must quit all Scripture Evidence, and give it up to
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I would not give it up to them;
I would give up nothing to them: but I would
have something to offer, that they should have no
Room to cavil at, if it were possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would put them to Silence, I suppose,
you mean, that they should have nothing to say,
no Room to open their Mouths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that is it indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that you must never expect from such
People; Error may be confuted, but I cannot say
it can be silenc'd: such People never blush.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, will they not yield when they are
beaten?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never; you see the <HI>Jews</HI> do not give
it up, they continue obstinate, and their Mouths
are full of Words; nay, they carry it on even to
Raillery, Contempt, and, I think, I may say justly
of them, to Blasphemy, and that of the worst kind,
'tis Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so indeed, they seem to make an im∣pious
Jest of our owning Jesus Christ to be the
<PB N="328" REF="342"/>
<HI>Messiah;</HI> they ridicule his being crucified, suffering
himself to endure the <HI>Contradiction of Sinners;</HI>
whereas they insist the <HI>Messiah</HI> shall be a glorious
Prince, triumphant over his Enemies, shall re∣deem
<HI>Israel,</HI> restore the Kingdom, and be victori∣ous
over all his People's Enemies. I tremble almost
to hear them talk, sometimes; they use such horrid
Expressions about the Meanness and Misery of him
we call the <HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet nothing is more plainly prophesied
in the Scripture than the Humiliation and Suffer∣ings
of Christ, his expiating of Sin by his Death,
and in that he triumph'd, as the Scripture says
expressly, 2 <HI>Col.</HI> xv. <HI>over Principalities and Powers;</HI>
namely, over all the Enemies of his Church, whe∣ther
Men or <HI>Devils,</HI> and as he says expressly to his
Disciples, encouraging them to bear the Enmity of
the Men of the World, <HI>John xvi. 33. In the World
ye shall have Tribulation; but be of good Cheer, I have
overcome the World.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But his Triumphs and Victories were not
such as the <HI>Jews</HI> expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, he triumphs by his Cross, and there
was his Glory, and his Victory; first, <HI>He humbled
himself to Death, even the Death of the Cross,</HI> and
therefore GOD <HI>highly exalted him, and gave him a
Name above every Name, that at the Name of</HI> JESUS
<HI>every Knee should bow,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 9, 10. so
that the Exaltation of the <HI>Messiah</HI> was of a quite
different Kind from that which the <HI>Jews</HI> ex∣pected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I suppose they did not under∣stand
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, and that stumbled them; that prejudiced
them against his Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and against their believing him to
be the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and does to this Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="329" REF="343"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the same Thing, in its Kind, stumbles
the present Gainsayers in the stating the Dignity and
Glory of his Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! the same Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as the <HI>Jews</HI> could not distinguish him
in one place as a glorious triumphant <HI>Messiah,</HI> and
in another place as an humbled injured Sufferer;
<HI>numbered among Transgressors; taking upon him the
Form of a Servant; in his Humiliation his Judgment
taken away; made of no Reputation,</HI> and the like;
so our Opposers cannot distinguish their Saviour
under the various differing Representations in which
the Scripture paints him out to us, and which seem,
as they pretend, to contradict one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for want of distinguishing Christ, ac∣cording
to the several Capacities and Qualities in
which he speaks of himself, or is spoken of, they
mistake the real Nature and Dignity of his Person;
Is not that it you mean, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is, exactly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be pleased, Sir, to give us some Exam∣ples
of these.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But first, let me explain my self a little far∣ther
in the General, wherein they mistake, or where∣in
they do not distinguish aright of Christ; they do
not distinguish his Person from his Office, as when
he speaks of himself, or when the Scripture speaks of
him in his Original Glory and Nature, and when in
the particular Case of his Innanition and Incarnation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Text you quoted before, I think, states
both the Cases, 2 <HI>Phil.</HI> vi. it says expressly, <HI>Being
in the Form of God, and equal with God;</HI> there is
his Original Glory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have quoted a most glorious Text, where
both the Qualities are expressed with the greatest
Clearness, and brought down to the meanest Un∣derstanding:
In the sixth Verse, as you say, his Ori∣ginal
Glory is described, that he was <HI>in the Form of
<PB N="330" REF="344"/>
God,</HI> and, as another Text calls it, <HI>the Image of the
invisible God,</HI> Col. i. 15. A Text they can never
cavil off, and immediately, <HI>ver.</HI> 7. it says, He
<HI>made himself of no Reputation,</HI> but <HI>took upon him the
Form of a Servant,</HI> and was <HI>made in the Likeness of
Man,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be plainer, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Here</HI> is our Saviour in the Glory of the Di∣vine
Nature, and <HI>There</HI> again in the lowest State
of his Incarnation; <HI>Here</HI> as <HI>Jehovah, There</HI> as the
Mediator; <HI>Here</HI> as the Lord our Maker, <HI>There</HI> as
the Lord our Saviour; <HI>Here as</HI> GOD over all,
blessed for ever, <HI>There</HI> as lifted up, and drawing all
Men to him; <HI>Here</HI> in the Form of GOD, <HI>There</HI> in
the Form of a Servant; <HI>Here</HI> he is the Image of the
invisible God, the express Image; the Word, which
was in the Beginning, and which was with God,
and was GOD, really GOD; <HI>There</HI> the Son of Man,
and really Man, or the Deity or Humanity toge∣ther,
by that mysterious Union, the hypostatick
Union, which is the Mystery hid from Ages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certainly for want of distinguishing in
these particular Articles, and knowing when the
Scripture speaks of him as GOD, and when as <HI>Me∣diator,</HI>
that most of the Mistakes arise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>And likewise when he speaks of himself in
either of these Qualifications: Here he says,</HI> I and
my Father are one; <HI>There,</HI> My Father is greater
than I, <HI>John xiv. 28. Here,</HI> I came forth from
<HI>GOD; There,</HI> I am a Man that has told you the
Truth, <HI>John viii. 40. Here,</HI> Of that Hour knoweth
no Man, no not the Son, but the Father only,
<HI>Matth. xxvi. 36. There,</HI> He knoweth all Things,
<HI>John xxi. 17. Here, he saith,</HI> I am not come of my
self, <HI>John vii. 28. And</HI> I come in my Father's
Name, <HI>John v. 13. And</HI> I speak not of my self, my
Doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me, <HI>John
vii 16 There,</HI> He that has seen me hath seen the
<PB N="331" REF="345"/>
Father, <HI>ver. 9. Here he doth nothing of himself;</HI>
I can of my self do nothing, <HI>John v. 30. There, he
raises dead</HI> Lazarus <HI>by a Word speaking; And</HI>
I give unto my Sheep eternal Life, <HI>John x. 28. and
thus in an innumerable Number of Texts.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daught.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so they pretend, I suppose, that
those Texts contradict one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and so no doubt they would if we take
them to mean one and the same identical Person
in the Sense of Nature, and the literal Construction
of the Words; and so Christ must be acknowledged
to speak the most unintelligible Nonsense, contra∣dicting
himself in a manner not reconcileable by
any Construction in the World; nor is it any way
reconcileable but by this of his Divine and Human
Nature united.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>One would think this very thing should con∣vince
them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That as they allow him to be the
<HI>Son of God,</HI> (however subordinate to GOD himself) they
must yet believe that he would neither talk falsely
or foolishly, neither talk unintelligibly or nonsen∣sically,
neither with Contradiction or Absurdity,
and that therefore there must be some higher Con∣struction
of the Words, and that they were recon∣cileable
some way or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may defy all the Clans of <HI>Arius</HI> and
<HI>Socinus,</HI> and their less consistent Successors the Mo∣dern
<HI>Deists,</HI> and Hereticks, to make Sense of these
Expressions, any other way than as the <HI>Jews</HI> did;
who went about to stone him for Blasphemy, and
for saying he was GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain the <HI>Jews</HI> understood him so, and
that indeed he understood himself so; and so also
when he answered the High Priest's Question, <HI>Art
thou the Christ the Son of the Blessed?</HI> and he answer∣ed
<HI>I am,</HI> Mark xvi. 61. and they called that An∣swer
Blasphemy, <HI>ver. 64. What need we any farther
Witnesses? ye have heard the Blasphemy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="332" REF="346"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be so understood, and can be no
otherwise, and it is on that Foundation that the
Learned and Pious Dr. <HI>Bates</HI> says, That either he
must be really GOD, or the worst and vilest of
Men, the greatest Impostor and Blasphemer; who,
being but <HI>a meer Man,</HI> yet accepted of Divine Ho∣nours,
assumed the Divine Authority in his Actions,
and declared himself to be ONE with GOD; and this
on many Occasions, besides those above.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have observed indeed that Christ there
owns himself to be the Son of GOD, that is, to be
equal with GOD, and that it is very clear to me it
is so; all the Scriptures agree in it, if they read
and consider them with Plainness and Sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now distinguishing rightly of the two
Natures in Christ, and speaking of him, or un∣derstanding
him to speak of himself, in the di∣stinct
Capacities of a GOD incarnated, and of a Man,
it is still plainer; speaking of him as real GOD, <HI>the
Creator of the World, by whom all Things were made,</HI>
John i. 3. and as <HI>real Man,</HI> the Mediator, giving his
Life a Ransom for many; This Way it is all re∣conciled
at once: <HI>As Man,</HI> he is the true Shepherd,
and layeth down his Life for his Sheep; <HI>As God,</HI> he
giveth eternal Life to his Sheep, and none shall
pluck them out of his Hand; <HI>As Man,</HI> his Father is
greater than all; <HI>As God,</HI> he is in the Father and
the Father in him; <HI>As Man,</HI> he knoweth nothing,
but all Things are given him of the Father; <HI>As
God, Peter</HI> says to him, John xxi. 17. <HI>Lord, thou
knowest all Things, thou knowest that I love thee.</HI>
St. <HI>John</HI> says, <HI>He needed not that any should testify of
Men, for he knew what was in Man,</HI> John ii. 25.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Distinction runs through every Trans∣action
of his Ministry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed at the Clearness and Justice
of distinguishing thus, and wonder how they can
withstand the Force of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="333" REF="347"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be endless indeed to reckon up all
the several Texts in the Scripture, which assure
us of the Divinity of his Person; but this Way of
arguing from them is, in my Opinion, as convincing
as any thing can be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I will come to another Argument, and
this is drawn from the Mission of the Holy Ghost:
The Godhead and Glory of Jesus Christ the <HI>Messiah</HI>
is in nothing more manifest than in sending the Holy
Spirit, which he calls <HI>the Promise of the Father:</HI>
He calls it indeed the Promise of the Father, but
it was also his <HI>own Promise:</HI> In one Place he says,
<HI>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the</HI>
FATHER <HI>will send in my Name,</HI> John xiv. 26. In
another Place he says, <HI>I will send him unto you,</HI> John
xvi. 7.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident that it was Christ who sent the
Comforter, the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth,
according to his Promise to his Disciples.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is openly declared so by St. <HI>Peter</HI> in his
Speech to the People, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 33. speaking of the
Holy Ghost, <HI>He hath shed forth this, which ye now
see and hear:</HI> He (that is) <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> and 'tis evi∣dent
it was the Consequence of his Exaltation; for it
is said in another Place, <HI>The Holy Ghost was not yet
given, because Christ was not yet glorified.</HI> John vii.
39. And in another Place, <HI>If I go not away, the
Comforter will not come unto you,</HI> John xvi. 7.
Now, What Inference can the Enemy draw from
this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>They make nothing of it, or make light
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we see no Reason to make light of it
for all that; we have no Argument, <HI>I hope,</HI> from
their Example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose we had, What can they say?
Could <HI>Jesus,</HI> as Man, send the Holy Spirit of Truth
among Men? When the Holy Ghost was sent, and
<PB N="334" REF="348"/>
had descended upon them, then indeed they were
<HI>indued with Power from on high,</HI> so that on whom∣soever
they laid Hands they received also the Holy
Ghost; but the Disciples did not send it: The
sending the Holy Ghost was certainly the immediate
Work of <HI>God,</HI> only that he was pleased to give that
heavenly Gift by the Medium of the Apostle's Be∣nediction;
and therefore some have said, that the
Holy Ghost was given by the Apostles laying on
of Hands, not that it was understood to be the same
Mission of the infallible Spirit as the Power from
on High which descended from Heaven upon the
Apostles themselves; but that this was only a Mea∣sure
of Faith, which is taken there for the Spirit,
and is translated so, being the same Spirit which is
said to be in Believers to the End of the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had it been really the Holy Ghost, as it
was given to the Apostles, then all those that re∣ceived
it would have spoken with Tongues, cast
out <HI>Devils,</HI> healed Diseases, raised the Dead; and,
in a Word, have wrought Miracles as the Apostles
themselves did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and all their Preaching would have
been the Word of God, I suppose, as we believe the
other is; because dictated by the infallible Spirit, all
which it was not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The first sending of the Holy Ghost was
evidently miraculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so, but it must be more than miracu∣lous
if Christ was not of the same glorious Essence
with the Father; for here is nothing but Absurdity,
Jesus Christ is said to be conceiv'd of the Holy
Ghost, and yet here he sends the Holy Ghost, and
indues with Power from on High.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet he is called the Son of Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then is the strange Contradiction
to be understood? The Holy Ghost send God,
and God send the Holy Ghost! or the Holy
<PB N="335" REF="349"/>
Ghost to overshadow the Virgin to produce a Man,
and then that Man promise to send the Holy Ghost!
and so the Holy Ghost is said to produce the Son,
and yet is said again, to proceed from the Father
and the Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all mystetious, and yet it is all a Mystery
reveal'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may observe our blessed Lord is all
along called <HI>the Son of God,</HI> and he owns himself to
be so; now he is properly and particularly the Son
of the Holy Ghost, as is plain from the Account
of his miraculous Conception; and the Scripture
says expressly, he shall be called <HI>the Son of God</HI> for
that Reason; because he was conceived of the Holy
Ghost, because the Power of the Highest oversha∣dowed
her, so that the Holy Ghost is here called the
Power of the Highest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this is used as a Testimony to the Divi∣nity
and Godhead of the Holy Ghost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so, but I am not upon that Point now;
our Lord is called <HI>the Son of</HI> GOD there, by Virtue of
his miraculous Conception, but he insists upon his
being the Son of God in his Discourse with the
<HI>Jews</HI> on another and still higher and more glorious
Account; namely, His being really equal with God:
<HI>John</HI> v. 18. His being really God, <HI>John</HI> x. 33.
His being <HI>in the Father, and the Father in him,</HI> John
x. 38. <HI>I and my Father</HI> are <HI>one,</HI> ver. 30. which the
<HI>Jews</HI> acknowledge was making himself God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that in one Place, The Holy Ghost is
his Father, and in another Place, God is his
Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, all which, by unavoidable Consequence,
and Arguments not to be repelled, illustrate to us
the glorious Mystery of the Holy Trinity▪ The
Holy Ghost is the Father of Christ, and
the Cause of the miraculous Conception; and
that Birth is thence called the Son of God;
<PB N="336" REF="350"/>
the same Son proceeds from God, is one with God,
is proclaimed from Heaven to be the Son of God,
promises to send upon his Disciples that blessed Spi∣rit
of Truth of whom he was conceived; so that
here God sends Christ, and Christ, after he reassumes
his Divine Glory, sends the same Holy Ghost, which,
in his Conception, is called GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is mysterious indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But all this Mystery is explained in a most
sublime Manner, and made easy by the right Con∣ceptions
of the Humanity and Incarnation of Christ;
and distinguishing between his Human and Divine
Nature; this is that which the Scripture means
by <HI>the Mystery of Godliness,</HI> GOD <HI>manifest in the
Flesh.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is remarkable that this Holy Ghost did
not come upon any, while Christ was upon Earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it is said <HI>he breathed on them,</HI> and
said, <HI>Receive ye the Holy Ghost,</HI> John xx. 22.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident there, that it is meant he gave
them, by that Breathing, a Power to receive and to
exercise the Graces of the Spirit, and therefore he
added the Power of Binding and Loosing, which he
gave to them all by that Benediction; but it is ex∣pressly
said in another Place, That <HI>the Holy Ghost
was not yet given, because Christ was not yet glorified,</HI>
John vii. 29. 'Tis evident that the Holy Ghost
was not given for that very Reason, because Christ
was not glorified: This Holy Ghost is again spoken
of in the first Person of Christ himself, where Christ
promises the Assistance of his Spirit to his People in
the Person of the Apostle; he says, <HI>Lo, I am with
you to the End of the World,</HI> by which is plainly un∣derstood
the Holy Ghost, so that the Holy Spirit
and Christ is one and the same, and the Holy Spirit
and God is the same, and CHRIST and GOD are
<HI>one: I am in the Father and the Father in me. He
<PB N="337" REF="351"/>
that hath seen me, hath seen the Father; I give eter∣nal
Life; He that hath the Son, hath Life; I am the
Light of the World.</HI> The Mystery is plain, <HI>Christ</HI>
as the Son of GOD, is One with GOD and with
the Holy Ghost, sends the Holy Ghost, and gives
Eternal Life. <HI>Christ,</HI> as the Son of Man, <HI>knows no∣thing</HI>
of himself, <HI>does nothing</HI> of himself, <HI>comes not</HI>
of himself, but is sent by the Father, is less than the
Father, and does the Will of his Father, keeps his
Father's Commandments, <HI>and the like:</HI> All these are
Expressions which the Scripture is full of.</P>
<P><HI>Christ Incarnated,</HI> and in a State of Humiliation,
was made of no Reputation, took upon him the
Form of a Servant, and the like; <HI>Christ risen from
the Dead,</HI> gives Power to receive all the Gifts and
Graces of the Spirit; and <HI>Christ glorified,</HI> gives <HI>the
Holy Spirit</HI> itself, the same Holy Ghost, of which he
himself, as to his Incarnation, was conceived, and
by which wonderful Conception he is called <HI>The Son
of</HI> GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>These Mysteries, I always look'd upon as
Things above my Reach; but they are abundantly
clearer to me now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I observe those People who argue against
their being intelligible, would perswade us that
they are not needful to be understood, any more
than they are intelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it needful to believe in Christ, and not
needful to know him? Is it Christianity to be∣lieve,
and not necessary to know in whom we have
believed? The Scripture says expresly, that it is ne∣cessary
to believe in Jesus Christ; <HI>He that believeth
on the Son hath everlasting Life; he that believeth not
the Son, shall not see Life, but the Wrath of GOD
abideth on him,</HI> John iii. 35. <HI>Whosoever believeth in
him shall not perish, but have everlasting Life,</HI> John
iii. 16. He that believeth on him is not condemned,
<PB N="338" REF="352"/>
he that believeth not, is condemned already; it is
necessary therefore to believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith in Christ is certainly necessary; there
are abundance of Scriptures to prove that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how shall we believe in him of whom
we have not heard? The Scripture was written that
we might know Christ, and that knowing, <HI>we might
believe on him; and that believing, we might have
Life thro' his Name,</HI> John xx. 31. As it is necessary
to believe in Christ, 'tis necessary to know him, or
else 'tis not necessary to have eternal Life; for this
is Life eternal to know God, and Jesus Christ, who
he has sent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis also certainly necessary to know Christ,
or else 'tis not necessary to be saved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then can they say, 'Tis not necessary
to know what he is? Are we to believe in we know
not what, and be saved by we not who?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be like the <HI>Athenians,</HI> indeed, to
build Altars to the UNKNOWN GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are we to pray to Christ or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, St. <HI>Stephen</HI> pray'd to him, <HI>Lord Je∣sus,
receive my Spirit,</HI> Acts vii. 59.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the Apostles, assembled at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
pray'd to him, when they cast Lots for the Choice
of an Apostle, in the Room of <HI>Judas,</HI> Acts i. 24.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if we must or may pray to him, How
shall we do this, if we know not who he is, or what
he is? must we pray to him, and not know whe∣ther
we pray to a God or a Man? To pray to him as
a Man, would be Popery, and worse than Popery, Rob∣bery,
robbing God, and the grossest of all Idolatry;
and yet St. <HI>Stephen</HI> and the Apostles evidently did so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>At least, it would be worshipping we know
not what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is then most ridiculous to endeavor to per∣suade
us, that we need not inquire into this Matter,
and need not know at whom we have believed; it
<PB N="339" REF="353"/>
is all one as to say, we need not know by who or by
what we are to be saved, or to whom we have
committed our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we do know him; we know him by the
Scriptures; the <HI>Samaritans</HI> as well as the Apostles
give a Testimony to him, <HI>John</HI> iv. 42. We believe
and know that this is the Christ, the Saviour of the
World: The Apostles say, We know and are sure,
that thou art the Christ the Son of the Living GOD.
Christ himself declares, <HI>I am</HI> the Christ, the Son of
the Blessed: And when the Women of <HI>Samaria</HI> says
to him, I know the <HI>Messias</HI> cometh which is called
Christ, he answers, <HI>I that speak, unto thee</HI> AM HE:
And he adds in another Place, <HI>If ye believe not that
I am</HI> HE, that is the <HI>Messias, ye shall die in your
Sins.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are all plain and positive Scriptures,
indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad we are come to that, for now the
Divinity of Christ will admit of a plain Proof by
Scripture Evidence, from his being proved to be the
<HI>Messias;</HI> as the Woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> said, Who is
called Christ? for if we allow <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the <HI>Christ,</HI>
the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Son of GOD, you must allow him
to be of a Divine Nature and Original, to be Real
and Essential GOD from the Prophesies of the
<HI>Messiah.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see into that, or else I do not un∣derstand
your Meaning, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Meaning is thus, That as I prov'd Jesus
Christ was the prophefied and promised <HI>Messiah,</HI>
which was to come into the World; all the Prophe∣sies
of the <HI>Messiah</HI> meeting and being fulfilled in his
Person, and in the Time, and Particulars of his Com∣ing;
so all those Scripture Prophesies concurring
to give Divine Honours to the <HI>Messias</HI> those Divine
Honours belong to Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that appears, the Consequence is plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="340" REF="354"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I have told you already what the Scripture
says of the</HI> Shiloh, <HI>the</HI> Messiah, <HI>the Saviour of</HI>
Israel, <HI>and in how many Places he is called</HI> Jehovah;
<HI>nay, even GOD, and the</HI> Son of <HI>GOD; see some of
them again,</HI> Isaiah <HI>vii.</HI> 14. Behold a Virgin shall
conceive and bear a Son, mid shall call his Name
<HI>GOD WITH US: (Immanuel) See the same Prophet</HI>
Isaiah <HI>ix.</HI> 6. For unto us a Child is born, unto us a
Son is given; and the Government shall, be upon his
Shoulder; and his Name shall be called, Wonderful,
Counsellor, The Mighty GOD, The Everlasting (<HI>or
Eternal</HI>) Father, The Prince of Peace. Of the Increase
of his Government and Peace there shall be no End,
the Throne of <HI>David,</HI> and upon his Kingdom, to
order it, and to establish it with Judgment and with
Justice, from henceforth even for ever: The Zeal of
the LORD of Hosts will perform this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are these the Prophesies of Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are Prophesies of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and I
have already proved, that <HI>this is</HI> HE.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some tell us that the Words are synony∣mous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't deal in hard Words, Brother;
What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean that they signify the same Thing: I
don't desire hard Words, Sister; I allow the plain∣est
Words are most becoming such a solemn Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know they say that the Word <HI>Messiah,</HI> or
<HI>Messias,</HI> and the Word <HI>Christ</HI> signify the same Thing
in the Original; and they do so, with very little Va∣riation,
that is to say the <HI>Saviour.</HI> The poor People
of <HI>Samaria</HI> explain them so, that <HI>the Messiah was
called Christ,</HI> and that the true <HI>Christ</HI> was <HI>the Saviour
of the Worlds,</HI> John iv. 42. But to prove farther,
that this <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is really the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and that
the <HI>Messiah</HI> was to be JEHOVAH, see a little the
Harmony of the Old Testament and the New, in this
Point, <HI>John</HI> i. 41. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>drew</HI> the Apostle having
<PB N="341" REF="355"/>
seen and spoken with Jesus Christ, finds out his
Brother <HI>Simon,</HI> and says to him, <HI>We have found the</HI>
MESSIAS, which is, being interpreted, THE CHRIST.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the Text which, they say, proves the
<HI>Messiah</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> to be the same, and that one is
no more than an Interpretation of the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does so very plainly; for it fays expresly,
that the Word <HI>Messias,</HI> being interpreted, is <HI>the</HI>
CHRIST: But let me go on; <HI>Philip</HI> having likewise seen
and been called to follow Christ, finds <HI>Nathaniel,</HI> and
he speaks thus, <HI>We have found him of whom</HI> Moses <HI>and
the Prophets writes,</HI> JESUS of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> &amp;c. Now
what did <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets write of <HI>Christ?
Moses</HI> wrote of the Seed of the Woman, which all
allow to signify the <HI>Messias;</HI> and of the <HI>Shiloh</HI> that
should come, which, was likewise the MESSIAS; <HI>to
whom the gathering of the People should be;</HI> but <HI>Micah</HI>
the Prophet explains him distinctly, <HI>Micah</HI> v. 2.
<HI>But thou,</HI> Bethlehem Ephratah, <HI>though thou be little
among the Thousands of</HI> Judah, <HI>yet out of thee shall
he come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler in</HI> Israel;
<HI>whose goings forth have been from of old, from ever∣lasting:</HI>
Here the MESSIAS is called the <HI>Everlasting,</HI>
that is certainly GOD; for nothing but God can be
<HI>Eternal</HI> or <HI>Everlasting. Isaiah</HI> says, <HI>I saw the</HI> LORD;
the Word in the Original is, <HI>I saw</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>sitting
on his Throne,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Isa.</HI> vi. 1. and in <HI>ver.</HI> 5. he says,
<HI>Mine Eyes have seen the King, the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts;</HI>
or as it is in the Original, <HI>The</HI> JEHOVAH <HI>of Hosts;</HI>
and this St. <HI>John</HI> says is spoken of CHRIST, <HI>John</HI>
xii. 41. <HI>These Things said</HI> Isaias, <HI>when he saw his
Glory and spake of him. Jeremiah</HI> is more express
still, and calls the <HI>Messias the Lord our Righteousness;</HI>
the Original is <HI>The</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>or</HI> GOD <HI>our Righte∣ousness,</HI>
Jer. xxiii. 6. <HI>In his Day</HI> Judah <HI>shall be
saved, and</HI> Israel <HI>shall dwell safety: and this is his
Name whereby he shall be called,</HI> THE LORD
OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS; and the like
<PB N="342" REF="356"/>
in <HI>Zech.</HI> iii. where the MESSIAS is called the BRANCH;
the same Word which is before called <HI>the</HI> LORD
<HI>our Righteousness,</HI> was by all Intrepreters under∣stood
to be be meant of CHRIST, who truly is JE∣HOVAH
<HI>our Righteousness.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are all Wonders to me; I was ne∣ver
able to put them together thus before: This
makes the hard Things easy to be understood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have not done yet; The <HI>Messias</HI> is called
the <HI>Branch</HI> (you see) in several Scriptures, <HI>Isaiah</HI>
xi. 1. <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 5. <HI>Zech.</HI> iii. 8. By the Prophet
<HI>Haggai</HI> he is called <HI>The Desire of all Nations,</HI>
Haggai ii. 7. By <HI>Daniel</HI> he is called the <HI>Messiah:</HI>
Again, by <HI>Jeremiah</HI> he is also called <HI>Jehovah our
Righteousness,</HI> as above; and by <HI>Daniel, Everlast∣ing
Righteousness,</HI> Dan. Ix. 24. In all these Texts,
the Divinity of the MESSIAS is declared and as∣serted,
he is the <HI>Eternal</HI> Everlasting <HI>Father, his
goings forth are from Everlasting,</HI> that is Eternity;
he is <HI>the Lord Jehovah,</HI> the JEHOVAH <HI>our Righteous∣ness,
the Everlasting Righteousness; this is the Mes∣sias,</HI>
and this <HI>Messiah</HI> and the <HI>Christ</HI> are <HI>One.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot see how the cavilling People of
this Age do avoid the Force of this, by any of their
Shiftings, and straining the Texts: They do not de∣ny
Jesus Christ to be the <HI>Messias,</HI> but they do not
meddle with the Question, Whether the <HI>Messiah</HI> was
to be the <HI>Eternal,</HI> the <HI>Everlasting,</HI> the <HI>Jehovah;</HI> it
seems to lie as a Thing not taken notice of by them,
or that they do not care to meddle with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does so; but there is another Thing which
they do not take Notice of also; and that is, that
the Scripture does expressly enjoin such Divine Ho∣nours
to be paid to Jesus Christ, as are (except to
him only) to be given to none but to GOD his
Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Divine Honours, except Praying
to him? Are there any other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="343" REF="357"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>believing in him;</HI> Faith is required, and
Faith <HI>in Christ,</HI> Repentance towards God, and <HI>Faith
in the Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> Now, the Scripture is ex∣press,
nothing but GOD is the Object of <HI>Faith;</HI> and
therefore Jesus Christ may be said here to assert his
own Deity, in saying, <HI>Believe also in me;</HI> making
himself an Object of Faith in Conjunction with
God; and as necessary for the Support of the Souls
of his Disciples as their Faith in God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is indeed implied, but not directly
expressed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis as plainly expressed as another Text,
a <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 2. <HI>Grace and Peace be multiplied unto you,</HI>
through the Knowledge of God, and our Saviour Jesus
<HI>Christ:</HI> So that Grace and Peace does not come by
the Knowledge of God alone, or of Christ alone,
but of both conjunctly and united.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is generally said, that God is the only Ob∣ject
of Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore Christ must be God, because
he is conjunctly the Object of Faith with God the
Father; God is the Object of Faith according to
his present Dispensation, that is, manifesting himself
to us as reconciled through a Redeemer, and so
God in Christ, or God and Christ, are one entire
Object of Faith: So he conjoins himself with God
in the other Text, <HI>John</HI> xii. 24. <HI>He that believes on
me, believes not on me,</HI> but <HI>on him that sent me;</HI> that
is, <HI>not on me only,</HI> but <HI>on him also that sent me.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how does this come down to the Argu∣ment
in Hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very exactly; for if Christ be a meer Crea∣ture,
how can he assert himself to be the Object of
our Faith in Conjunction with <HI>the eternal God?</HI> If
he were not equal with God in the <HI>Divinity of his
Nature,</HI> it would be the highest Presumption in the
World, to make himself equal to him as the Object
of Faith; yet this he does <HI>John</HI> vi. 29. <HI>This is the Work
<PB N="344" REF="358"/>
of God, that you believe on him whom he hath sent;</HI>
besides, 'tis a differing Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, 'tis one Thing to believe a Person,
and another Thing to believe on him: We believe
<HI>Peter,</HI> and believe <HI>Paul,</HI> but we are never said
to believe in <HI>Peter</HI> and in <HI>Paul;</HI> if Christ were a
mere Man, though in the highest Throne of Ho∣nour
and Excellence, yet he could not be the Object
of Faith and Trust, without an Offence to God:
To believe in Christ is to rely upon and rest in him
for Salvation and Pardon: This is proper to the
Deity only, and is one Flower of his Crown; nay, if
Christ were a mere Man, we are cursed of God for
trusting in him, <HI>Cursed is he that maketh Flesh his
Arm,</HI> Jer. xvii. 5. but if we are blessed for our
Confidence in him, then he is more than a mere
Man; <HI>Psalm</HI> ii. 12. Faith centres only in God, thro'
Christ: God is the only Object of our Confidence
and Faith, especially as Faith is distinguish'd here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we are commanded to believe his Word,
and his Prophets, <HI>Believe</HI> IN GOD; so shall ye be
established, <HI>believe</HI> his Prophets, <HI>so shall you prosper,
2 Chron.</HI> xx. 2.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the very Text that confirms my Di∣stinction;
you are bid to believe the Prophets, that
is, to believe what they say, and no doubt it is our
Duty to do so, because they speak from GOD; but
you, are commanded to believe IN GOD, not only
to believe him when he speaks, whether by Pro∣phets
or otherwise, but to believe <HI>in him,</HI> which is
quite another Thing; the <HI>Devils</HI> believe Christ, but
they don't believe <HI>in him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a Distinction I never observed be∣fore
indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I either; yet 'tis very just, I
think, and plain to understand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="345" REF="359"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Very plain; and thus we are bid to believe</HI> in
Christ <HI>in abundance of Places,</HI> John <HI>iii.</HI> 16. For God
so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but
have everlasting Life. <HI>And again,</HI> ver. 18. He that
believeth on him, is not condemned: But he that be∣lieveth
not is condemned already, because he hath not
believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God:
<HI>And again,</HI> ver. 33, <HI>and 36. the Testimony of</HI>
John the Baptist <HI>to the Divinity of Christ;</HI> He that
hath received his Testimony, hath set to his Seal, that
God is true. He that believeth not the Son, hath ever∣lasting
Life; and he that believeth not the Son, shall
not see Life: <HI>Here is eternal Death threatened as
the Punishment of not believing on Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they will question here the Justice of the
Distinction, between believing, and believing IN or
ON <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Distinction is plain; to believe IN or
ON Christ is expressed by the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> as I said
before, <HI>John</HI> iv. 42. <HI>We know that this is indeed the</HI>
CHRIST, <HI>the</HI> SAVIOUR <HI>of the World.</HI> And again,
Thou hast the Words of Eternal Life, and we believe
and are sure that thou art the Christ, the Son of the
<HI>Living God,</HI> Or, as the Words may be read, <HI>Thou art
the Christ, the Living God;</HI> John iv. 68, 69. and in∣deed,
in all these Texts it might bear the same In∣ference:
How could he give Eternal Life to his
Sheep, <HI>John</HI> x. 28. Give them Power to become the
Sons of God who believed on his Name, <HI>John</HI> i. 12.
Know all Things, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 30. <HI>Now are we sure
that thou knowest all Things; by this we believe that
thou camest forth from God;</HI> And what can it be to
come forth from God? Whatsoever is of GOD is
GOD. But there are many more Texts which con∣firm
this; I need not repeat them, you will find
them in your daily Reading; as particularly that
glorious Text where Christ declares himself to be
<PB N="346" REF="360"/>
the <HI>Son of GOD;</HI> and demands of the Man born
blind, whether he believed <HI>on him as such,</HI> John
ix. 35, 36, 37. and the other of St. <HI>John,</HI> I John
iii. 23. <HI>This is his Commandment, that we shall be∣lieve
on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That last Text is express, that it is God's
Command that we should believe on the Name of
his Son Jesus Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I observe some Texts express it, be∣lieving
<HI>in</HI> Christ, and some believing <HI>on</HI> him; Pray,
Sir, is there any Difference in that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Child, none at all; nor is there any one
Text in all the Book of God, that I remember,
that directs to believe IN or ON, or IN or ON <HI>the
Name</HI> of any Person or Thing, but the Person or
Name of God and Jesus Christ: It is one of the
particular Characters by which Jesus Christ is said to
be manifest as God, and which is Part of the great
Mystery of Godliness, namely, That he was be∣lieved
ON in the World, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I understand, and I am satisfied it
is so; but I would know about those Two Expres∣sions
IN and ON, whether there is any Difference, or
any considerable Difference between them? because
sometimes one is used, and sometimes the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all, Child; the Words are the same
Thing, and in all Languages are expressed by the
very same Word; particularly you, Child,(speaking
to his Daughter) can, read <HI>French,</HI> look ill your
<HI>French</HI> Bible, and there you will find it is expressed
both Ways by the same Word, that which we call
believe <HI>on,</HI> is sometimes expressd <HI>in;</HI> and that
which we express <HI>in,</HI> is there expressed <HI>on,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI>
iii. 18. <HI>He that believeth on him,</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> it is
<HI>Qui croit on lui,</HI> which is in <HI>English</HI> IN HIM: And
in the same Verse, <HI>in the Name,</HI> is expressed <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nom,</HI>
which is used for <HI>on</HI> or <HI>in.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="347" REF="361"/>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can read it there, and I will look all
the Texts over, to see how it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, Child; and then, <HI>Son,</HI> you may do
the same in the <HI>Latin,</HI> where you will find it al∣ways
expressed by the Particle <HI>in,</HI> as in the same
Text; pray look for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here it is, and it is so, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray read it.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[<HI>He reads the Words.</HI> Qui credit IN eum,
non condemnator: qui Vero non credit, jam
condemnatus est: quia non credit IN No∣men
unigeniti Filii Dei.]</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the same in both Places IN <HI>him</HI> and IN
<HI>the Name.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, indeed, it is plain, that it is the
same Thing to believe <HI>in</HI> Christ and <HI>on</HI> Christ, and
<HI>in</HI> the Name or <HI>on</HI> the Name of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now let the Opposers of Christs Divinity
tell us, if we are any where directed in Scripture to
believe in Man, or in any Creature or Thing but
God, or the Lord Jesus Christ; and if they cannot,
then it will be hard for them to say, that this Glory
is given to another, to a Creature; God alone is the
Object of Faith and of Worship; but both Faith
and Worship is given to Christ, and our Lord says,
<HI>Ye believe in GOD, believe also in ME,</HI> Mat. iv. 10.
<HI>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve. Believe in the Lord thy God, so
shalt thou be established,</HI> 2. Chron. xx. 20. The Words
are expressed alike in both Texts, for that which is
explained by our Lord himself to mean <HI>him only
shalt thou serve,</HI> is expressed, <HI>Thou shalt serve him,</HI>
in that very Text from whence it is quoted, <HI>Deut.</HI>
vi. 13. So, <HI>Believe in the Lord thy God,</HI> is certainly
intended to mean, <HI>Believe in him alone;</HI> the Words
of King <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI> plainly infer so much; and so
of many other Texts, which it would be too long
<PB N="348" REF="362"/>
to repeat, and yet our Lord says, <HI>You believe
GOD, believe also in ME.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is plain enough, Sir, I think; we are to
worship God only, and to believe in God only; and
yet we are to worship Christ, and believe in Christ
too; How can that be reconciled?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, indeed? Who then is this Messias? And
who is this Jesus Christ, who is to be worshipped
and believed in, under the same Penalties, and by
the same express Command, as God himself is to be
worshipped and believed in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But may the Word Faith be given to both
the several Kinds of Believing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we are to believe the Word of God, the
Prophets and Servants of God speaking from him,
and the Works of God; and that is called Faith:
But you must distinguish of Faith; there is an Hi∣storical
Faith, that is giving Credit to, or believing the
Prophets, and the Testimony that God has given of
himself, and the Works of Christ; but the Believ∣ing
in God and in Christ, is a Grace, a Gift, a
Power given, and planted by the Holy Spirit of
God in the Heart; By the Mouth we make Con∣fession,
but <HI>with the Heart Man believeth,</HI> Rom. x.
10. And in the foregoing Verse of the same Chap∣ter,
<HI>If thou shalt believe in thine Heart;</HI> what follows?
<HI>Thou shalt be saved.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you make several Sorts of Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not several Sorts of Faith in God; that is but
one Faith, and of one Kind; and 'tis therefore
called, <HI>The Faith of God's Elect,</HI> Titus i. 1. and
<HI>Saving Faith;</HI> the <HI>Gift of God;</HI> and <HI>Justifying Faith;</HI>
with several other Epithets; and the whole Chri∣stian
Religion is called <HI>The Faith</HI> in many Texts;
whereas believing the Word of GOD, the Prophets
of GOD, and the Being of GOD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is quite
another Thing; the <HI>Devil</HI> may be said to have this
Faith, but none have the true Saving Faith in
<PB N="349" REF="363"/>
Christ Jesus, but those who, as the Apostle says,
<HI>Believe in him, to the Saving of the Soul.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who are they that believe to the
Saving of the Soul?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why those that believe in Christ, <HI>John</HI> iii. 15,
16. <HI>For whosoever believes in him, shall not perish, but
have Everlasting Life;</HI> that is, <HI>Shall be saved. Be∣lieve
on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,</HI>
Acts xvi. 31. Ye are not of them that draw back
unto Perdition, but of them which believe to the
Saving of the Soul.</P>

<P>Nothing is more plainly laid down in the
Scripture, than that Faith in Christ is required, in
order to Salvation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which, I think is a glorious Testimony of
his eternal Power and Godhead; he is evidently made
the Object of our Faith, and that equally as
God; believing in him is essential to our Salvation,
and has the Promise of Life annexed to it: God
himself can have no more; and those People that will
have him be superior, or subordinate to the Father,
cannot deny but that the same Reward is given to us
for believing in him, cleaving to him, confessing
him before Men, and the like, as is given for our
believing in God the Father; and the Scripture
says, that all Men should honour the Son, even as
they honour the Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how then can these Men tell us, that it
is not Christianity for us to inquire into this great
Mystery, or to know whether there is an Equality of
Persons or no? it seems to me, that 'tis a most es∣sential
Point, that we may know how to direct our
Faith, Petitions, Homage, and Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly; it is a most essential Point of
Christianity and which we ought to be rightly in∣formed
of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why then do they puzzle all our Inqui∣ries
into it, with so many Difficulties about the
<PB N="350" REF="364"/>
several Readings of the Scriptures? This is to be
interpreted so, and this so; This is in the Original,
and this is in some Copies, and not in others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take all that to be the mere Effect of obsti∣nate
Unbelief; which leaving the plain and undeni∣able
Consequences of Things, and turning or wresting
the Scriptures to their own particular Meanings,
would support Error by challenging the Truth, and
seek for Shifts and Subterfuges in the different
Readings, and doubtful ambiguous Construction of
Words to avoid the Force of plain and pungent
Texts; so to lessen the Credit of them, or leave us
unsatisfied of the true Sense, till they can decide
those jarring Disputes, reconcile those Readings,
and have all their Objections answered and silenced,
which may probably be never brought to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Reason, I suppose, that they call
for Meetings of learned Men to dispute and dis∣course
these Things, to compare the Originals, and
examine into the true Sense of the Antients in those
Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when will they finish the Dispute? Sup∣pose
all the learned Men in the World were brought
together for that Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, they allow it themselves, that the
Dispute would take up a great deal of Time, per∣haps
some Years, some Ages, and I believe I might
add, that they are not sure it would ever be decided,
or that they should all come at last to find out the
Weighty Truth; so as to have all Contradictions
silenc'd, and put to an End.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what must become of the Christian
World in the mean Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to what, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to being at a Certainty in this mighty
Question; Must they lie all that while in a State of
Uncertainty? Must they never know in whom they are
to believe? And how must all the Christians die who
<PB N="351" REF="365"/>
are called away in that Time? Must they die in a
State of Ignorance and Uncertainty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a dreadful State are we all in! Our
Altars are all inscribed to the Unknown God! Re∣ligion
is all a hidden Mystery, a universal Blank!
and the Word of GOD a mere dead Letter; its au∣thentick
Verity not established, the Authority of
it not acknowledged, or the Readings of it de∣termined.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor do we know which is right and which is
wrong translated, till they shall determine it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blessed be GOD the Stumbling Blocks are all
removed, by the Promise of Christ to send the Spirit
of Truth, the Comforter, to lead us into all Truth,
and to bring all Things to our Remembrance; and
that this Spirit is a truly infallible Guide and Inter∣preter
of Scripture, even more infallible than the
Pope, and he will reveal Christ to us; he has said of
this Spirit, that <HI>He shall take of mine, and shall shew
it unto you;</HI> So that 'tis plain, we do not need these
disputing Gentlemens determining of these Things
so much as they imagine we do; let us search the
Scripture, and seek the Guidance of the Spirit to in∣terpret
that Scripture, and to guide us to the Know∣ledge
of Christ, and he will guide us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, Which are the Scriptures
which they dispute?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are several; but this is one in particu∣lar
which they object against, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 7. <HI>For there
are Three that bear Record in Heaven; the</HI> Father,
<HI>the</HI> Word, <HI>and the</HI> Holy Ghost, <HI>and these Three are</HI>
ONE.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do they object against that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why first, you are to understand, they cannot
resist the Force of the Words, if granted to be a
real Piece of the Scripture, and so be dictated by
the infallible Spirit; and therefore they would fain
<PB N="352" REF="366"/>
lessen the Credit of them by denying their Legiti∣macy,
and so take off their Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do they say to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say, they are not in the Original, or
in several of the Manuscript Copies of the New
Testament, which were in Use in the primitive Days,
and so they would deny them tobe St. <HI>John's</HI> Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do not say they are in none of them,
do they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, they cannot say that; but because
they are not in all of them, therefore they would de∣ny
them to be authentick; that Truth, as I told you
just now, is like a Blast of Lightning to all the Here∣tical
Doctrines, which it was written against; and they
foresaw it, and could bring no other Objection but to
cavil at its being Authentick, and this is but a weak
Shift indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what Doctrines were these Words
written against?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I told you once before; the Gospel of
St. <HI>John</HI> was particularly pointed at the Errors of
Two Persons (<HI>viz.) Ebion</HI> and <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> who even
in those early Days of the Christian Religion, ad∣vanced
this Blasphemy (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they denied the
Divinity of Jesus Christ, and allowed him to be
only a mere Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! was it so soon that this Error began?
Why then 'tis very ancient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it was very happy that it broke out
so soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the Truth had immediately so glo∣rious
a Defender; being one of those on whom the
infallible Spirit was immediately shed abroad, at the
first Assembly of the Apostles; and on whose Head
the cloven Tongues rested; the same who, with
<HI>Peter,</HI> healed the impotent Man in the Porch of the
Temple; the same Disciple who leaned on the Bo∣som
<PB N="353" REF="367"/>
of Jesus Christ, and of whom it was particular∣ly
said, that JESUS loved him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it that Disciple who wrote the
Epistles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he wrote the Gospel, and the Three
Epistles, and the Revelations; and throughout his
Gospel and Three Epistles, he particularly aims, in
almost every Part of them, to establish the Dignity
and Glory of The Son of God; calls him The Son,
The Only Son, The only begotten of God, The Light,
The God, The True God, and Life Eternal; and
particularly in this fifth Chapter of his Third Epi∣stle,
he hath this Expression, <HI>There are Three that
bear Record in Heaven;</HI> or, as others understand
it, <HI>there are Three in Heaven that bear Record;</HI>
which, indeed, I take to be the better Reading.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold; pray, Sir, do any read it so? I think
that explains the Words very much to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the learned Annotators, both in the
<HI>English</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> allow it to read best so; tho'
our vulgar Translation is as you see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, pray go on with your Objection
again, which you say our Opposers make to this
Text, for you said, they deny it to be authentick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that it is not St. <HI>John's</HI> Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do they prove it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>All they have to say, is, that it is not to be
found in all the Manuscript Copies of this Epistle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>If they could have proved it was not in the
Original Epistle, written by the Evangelist's own
Hand, they had said something.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or in none of the first Copies; but to say
it is not in all of them, that's saying but little against
it, methinks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>They can do neither of these; I'll give you
the utmost of what they have to say:</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="368"/>
1. They tell us, it is left out in <HI>several Manuscripts;</HI>
that is, as I said just now, that it is not to be
found <HI>in all of them.</HI></P>
<P>2. That several of the Fathers who wrote against
the Heresy of <HI>Arius,</HI> do not make use of this
Text; which, they say, being so clear a Te∣stimony
of the Divinity of Christ, they would
not have failed to have taken the Advantage of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There seems to be some Weight in those
Things too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Son, I think not; I think a Cause is
but very sorrily defended, that has nothing but such
miserable Negatives to oppose to the Evidence of a
Positive Text of Scripture. If they would support
such a Case as this in due Form, they ought to be
able to prove, that the Expression was to be found
in but a very few Manuscripts, or only in such as
were most modern; and that the Primitive Chri∣stians,
and the Manuscript Copies of the best and
most ancient Authority, knew nothing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant that, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whereas on the contrary, this Text, in the
very express Words of it, is to be found in a great
many, nay, in most of the Manuscript Copies that
are extant, and those of the ancient and of the best
Authority; also they are found quoted in the Wri∣tings
of the most valuable and venerable Fathers of
Antiquity in the first Ages of the Church: <HI>For Ex∣ample,</HI>
Not to speak of St. <HI>Jerome, Fulgentius,</HI> and
many others, who wrote in the fourth Century against
the Heresies of <HI>Arius</HI> since the Council of <HI>Nice;</HI> but
to go back beyond them all, the famous St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and a glorious Martyr of the
Primitive Times, who lived a little above 100 Years
after the Evangelist St. <HI>John,</HI> and who suffered Mar∣tyrdom
in the Year CCLVIII. after Christ; I say, St.
<PB N="355" REF="369"/>
<HI>Cyprian</HI> quotes this Text expresly, in his Book of
<HI>The Unity of the Church;</HI> and <HI>Tertullian,</HI> more an∣cient
still than he, mentions and insists upon it, in
his Book called, <HI>Adversus Praxeam;</HI> or a <HI>Dispute
against</HI> Praxeas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Age did <HI>Tertullian</HI> live in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He flourished about the End of the same
Century, in which St. <HI>John</HI> died, being not above
Eighty Years after the Evangelist wrote this very
Text; for <HI>Tertullian</HI> wrote his Apology for the
Christians in the Year 199 or 200.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is truly ancient enough; do they
name one Writer of equal Antiquity or Authority,
who has taken no Notice of it; or any Manuscript
Copies before their Time, in which this Verse was
not to be found?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, no,</HI> None at all, nor any after them for
near 200 Years: Since then, nothing can be offered
against the Credit of Two Authors of such undoubt∣ed
Sincerity, and that both of them acknowledge
and quote this Text, Shall it be any just Objection
against the Scripture, to say that some modern Wri∣ters,
perhaps tainted with the Heresy of the <HI>Ebion∣ites,</HI>
or Favourers of <HI>Arius,</HI> and of much less Re∣putation,
have thought fit to omit it, or wilfully to
leave it out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, I think 'tis of no Force at all,
if it has no better Authority than that; for this may
be no more than to say, that if <HI>Arius</HI> had written
a Comment upon this Epistle, he would have left it
out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just thus stands the Authority of this Text;
which I think is not at all shaken by any Suggestions
of modern Writers, while we have the Authority
of such as those more ancient, and of so much bet∣ter
Fame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, as these Men are full of Cavils, Have
they nothing to say against those ancient Authors?
<PB N="356" REF="370"/>
I have heard some of them boast, that they are
able to take off the Force of all those ancient Fa∣thers
very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they have abundance of Cavils upon
this Part of the Subject, and indeed have little else;
much Cavil, little Argument: Their Objections are
too many for your hearing in our ordinary Discourse,
and some of them too trifling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Sir, do not say so; if they are not
too tedious for you, they cannot be so for us: In∣struction
cannot be bought too dear; the search∣ing
thus into ancient Things is out of my Reach,
but I know you will bring it all down to our Un∣derstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The quoting tedious Things in antient Wri∣ters
may be difficult and long, but the Inferences
are short, and the Conclusion from it is plain; you
will understand them readily enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we may, Sir; if I do not, I shall
ask you to explain Things as you go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will name you some of their Objections
against the Authority of this Text.</P>
</SP>
<P>1. They tell us, as I said before, that this
Passage is not in the <HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts, or Oriental
Versions of the New Testament; but this is fully
answered by a late Learned Author, Mr. <HI>D. Martin,</HI>
who tells us those Manuscripts are erroneous in many
other places, and he gives a long Variety of Omissi∣ons
in them, so that they are not to be depended
upon one way or other; but he adds, that there is
an <HI>Armenian</HI> Version, re-printed at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI>
about Sixty Years ago, taken from the best Manu∣script
Copies of the East, and which the Enemies
of this Doctrine acknowledge to be very good; and
there the Text is plainly set down; so that it is
found in the Copy, carefully collated with the best
Editions, and only left out in Copies which have
<PB N="357" REF="371"/>
left out other very material Things as well as
that.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is easy: I that understand no∣thing
of Antiquity, understand this well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they object, 1. That the Councils of
<HI>Nice</HI> and <HI>Sardica</HI> made no mention of this Text.
2. That several ancient Commentators upon Saint
<HI>John's</HI> Epistle, have passed it over in Silence, and
take no Notice at all of it. 3. That the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Latin</HI> Fathers have omitted it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see into that; What does their
omitting it prove? Do they say any thing against it,
or do they deny it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not a Word; they only do not mention
the Verse, when they had no Occasion for it; some
were speaking upon one Subject, some of another,
and all were generally pointed at <HI>Arius,</HI> whose
particular Error was denying the Divinity of Christ;
whereas this Text was particularly brought to assert
the coeval Godhead of the Holy Spirit, which
<HI>Arius,</HI> at that Time, did not meddle with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it asserts the Godhead of Christ
too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and we use it upon that Ac∣count,
because our Modern Heresy extends to
both; but <HI>Arius</HI> was not, at least not yet, gone
that Length that our People go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you mentioned St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Ter∣tullian,</HI>
who were exceeding antient, and who both
of them acknowledge this Text; I wish you would
tell us, what they have to say against them; they are
Men the Church has always had in great Venera∣tion,
and if they acknowlege it, I should think the
Objections ought to be very weighty that should
shake their Evidence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it ought indeed, but far from that, their
Objections are so trifling, that it apparently shews
<PB N="358" REF="372"/>
they are plung'd into inextricable Difficulty, by the
Force of those Authors; I will mention the Objecti∣ons
in short, and refer you to an Author who has
hitherto been unanswered for the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Is that Author a Protestant or
a Roman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would have been the same thing, <HI>for</HI> the
Roman Church (whatever they are in other Points)
are very found in this, and that universally.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, and therefore I think if a Pro∣testant
Divine asserts it, 'tis liable to the less Ex∣ception;
for they tax the <HI>Romans</HI> with taking it
only upon Trust, that is implicitly, on the Faith of
the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I need not be ashamed of the Author,
it is the same I mentioned just now, the truly Learned
and Reverend Mr. <HI>David Martin,</HI> Minister of the
<HI>French</HI> Church at <HI>Utrecht,</HI> and who has written large
and critical Annotations upon the whole Bible,
which he published by Order of the States, also he
has written a <HI>critical Dissertation</HI> upon this very Sub∣ject,
proving fully this Text of the Seventh Verse
of the Fifth Chapter of St. <HI>John</HI> to be Authentick,
which Work, I say, has never yet been an∣swered;
I have the Book here, and will leave it
you for your further Instruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am mighty glad of such a Book, Sir;
but I beg you will please, for our Direction (who
are Children) to read us such a Part of it as you
will direct us to look upon, suitable to our Capacities,
and to this particular Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will do so, if you have Patience for it;
and Sum it up for you, and leave you to read it at
large, at your Leisure: First then, to the Objection
that the Seventh Verse is not to be found in the
<HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts of the New Testament, the Ob∣jection
is laid down boldly thus:</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="373"/>
“That this Text is no where to be found in the
<HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts of St. <HI>John's</HI> Epistle.”</P>
<P>This Author answers, (1.) That as this Passage
has ever been in the <HI>Italick</HI> Version, even as antient
as the First and Second Century, the Compilers
of the said <HI>Italick</HI> Version must either have put it
in of their own Heads, which is too absurd to be
advanced, and cannot be proved; <HI>or</HI> they must
have translated it from the <HI>Greek,</HI> in which Lan∣guage
the holy Evangelist wrote it.</P>
<P>To this he adds; That St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> who lived in
the Close of the Fourth Century, who revised and
corrected the old <HI>Italick</HI> Copies, applied himself to
throw out the principal Faults which had stolen into
the Manuscripts, and this he did by strictly ex∣amining
the <HI>Greek</HI> Copies, and he left this Text in
his corrected Work; so that it is plain (adds he)
we have the <HI>Greek</HI> Manuscripts on our Side, and
those the most Ancient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>You need not say this Author has not been
answered; What answer it it possible to give to such
Reasoning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, hear him a little further however.</P>
<P>“If, <HI>says he,</HI> when the <HI>African</HI> Bishops drew up
their famous Confession of Faith, the Passage of
St. <HI>John,</HI> which holds so considerable a Place
there, had not been in the <HI>Greek</HI> Copies of the
New Testament, they could not have urged it,
without a severe Censure: The <HI>Arians,</HI> who un∣derstood
<HI>Greek</HI> too well to be imposed upon, would
have exclaimed loudly, that they had quoted
Scripture which was not to be found in their
Bibles.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure they would; I think, nothing
can be plainer than that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has another Passage as clear as that, taken
from one R. <HI>Simon</HI> a Learned Man, but a great
Opposer of this Text, and one, says he, from whose
<PB N="360" REF="374"/>
Writings <HI>these Clamours principally</HI> proceed. This
Author wrote a Book called <HI>A Critical History of the
New Testament,</HI> in which he has these Expressions.</P>
<P>In one Place he says, <HI>“This Passage is in very
few</HI> Greek <HI>Manuscripts.”</HI></P>
<P>In another, <HI>It is not in the Generality of the Greek
Copies.”</HI></P>
<P>In a Third, <HI>It is only in the most modern</HI> Greek
<HI>Copies.”</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, it seems, he owns that it is in some
of them, though but in <HI>a Few.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and that (<HI>says Mr.</HI> Martin <HI>very well</HI>)
is a full Answer to those who assert peremptorily,
That it is in none of 'em; and then he adds these
significant Words:</P>
<P>“What Mr. <HI>Simon</HI> says, that 'tis only in the
most modern Manuscripts, would do him no Ser∣vice
<HI>should we grant it;</HI> but, on the contrary, 'tis
certain the Text is found in Manuscripts of the
highest Antiquity.”</P>
<P>After this he goes on to prove his Assertion, and
does it most unanswerably, as you will see in Four
Pages together, <HI>viz.</HI> Page 54, 55, 56, 57. But one
Example is very particular: About 300 Years ago
(<HI>says he) Laurentius Vallo,</HI> a Nobleman of <HI>Rome,</HI>
and of vast Learning for the Time he lived in, was
the first who made Enquiry after the <HI>Greek</HI> Manu∣scripts
of the New Testament. He got into his
Hands Seven, a Number at that Time very consi∣derable:
The Passage of St. <HI>John</HI> was in all the
Seven; some of those Manuscripts were of Four or
Five hundred Years standing, which, added to the
Three hundred Years past since, amount to, at least,
Seven or Eight hundred Years, so that the <HI>Greek</HI>
Manuscripts, in which the above-named Mr. <HI>Simon</HI>
says it is wanting, is more modern than those.</P>

<P>I think there is no need of any more Evi∣dence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="361" REF="375"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he brings a great many more <HI>for all that,</HI>
such as <HI>Erasmus, Edward Ley,</HI> a Learned Opposer
of <HI>Erasmus,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Cajetan,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Ximenes,
R. Stephens,</HI> the University of <HI>Louvain,</HI> Father <HI>Ame∣lotte,</HI>
and several more besides, all referring to divers
ancient Manuscripts of the <HI>Greek</HI> New Testament,
which have all of them this Clause; and he tells us
where those Manuscripts are to be found, as parti∣cularly
in the <HI>French</HI> King's Library, and the King
of <HI>Prussia's</HI> Library at <HI>Berlin;</HI> in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Li∣brary,
and several others, for which, I say, I refer
you to the Book itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we need not enquire any farther
into that, 'tis too plain for any thing that can be
offer'd to overthrow it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis evident the Verse is in the most authen∣tick
<HI>Greek</HI> Copies, even back to Persons almost con∣temporary
with the first Pen-man, the blessed Evan∣gelist
himself; Now if it is in the first Copies, it will
pass for sufficient Evidence that it was in the Ori∣ginal,
and if in the Original, it is Canonical Scrip∣ture,
and that's enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what have they to say against <HI>Tertullian,</HI>
and St. <HI>Cyprian?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly nothing; nothing of Weight, or that is
material, 'tis all but miserable Cavilling: They pre∣tend
that <HI>Tertullian</HI> does not quote the Text, only
speaking upon the Subject of the Trinity recites
the Words, <HI>These Three are One,</HI> as his own Words,
and not as a Quotation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But where had he the Words then? And
how came he to speak just the same Words? And
how do they prove he did not refer to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reverend Author, whose Book I have
here undertaken to defend <HI>Tertullian</HI> by, shews
that it was ordinary to repeat Texts of Scripture,
without quoting or referring to Chapter and Verse,
and he gives two Examples, exactly agreeing with
<PB N="362" REF="376"/>
<HI>Tertullian,</HI> one from St. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> and the other from
<HI>Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> but I refer you to the Place,
<HI>Pages</HI> 49, 50.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do they say against St. <HI>Cyprian?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly as little, and Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> confutes that
little too, very plain, and, as I think, unanswerably,
Pages 44, 45.</P>
<P>1. They would have it that St. <HI>Cyprian's</HI> Works,
as we have them, are altered in several Places.</P>
<P>2. They say the holy Martyr's Words relate to
the next Verse of St. <HI>John, The Spirit, the Water,
and the Blood.</HI></P>
<P>To both these, I say, he gives clear Answers:
To the First he says, If it were so, it does not ap∣pear
that this Part was ever altered in the least, and
that there was no Manuscript of St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> to be
produced which has not the very Words, without
any Alteration at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if they cannot prove that this Passage
was altered, 'tis nothing at all to the Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Second, 'tis a meer Fallacy, and
Mr. <HI>Martin</HI> proves it to be so, and brings several
Evidences to prove that St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> meant this very
Verse, and no other; one of these is <HI>Fulgentius</HI> Bi∣shop
of <HI>Ruspe,</HI> who, writing against the <HI>Arians,</HI>
quotes St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> at large: His Words are these;
“This the blessed Martyr St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> has withal ac∣knowledged,
writing in his Epistle concerning the
Unity of the Church thus, <HI>It is written of the FA∣THER,
the SON, and the</HI> HOLY GHOST, <HI>that these
Three are One.”</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Sir, we need no farther Reason∣ing
upon it, the Words were certainly St. <HI>John's,</HI>
and are a Part of the Word of God, there is no
room to deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you said something, Sir, of another
Text in this latter Epistle, wherein the same Saint
<HI>John</HI> asserts the Godhead of Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="363" REF="377"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did so, and it is a very remarkable Place,
'tis in the 20th Verse of the same Chapter, the
Words are these; <HI>We are in him that is true,</HI> even
<HI>in his Son Jesus Christ: This is the</HI> TRUE GOD, and
<HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does the Text intend, or are we to under∣stand
it, that Jesus Christ is the True God, and
Eternal Life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it is clear that we should understand it
so; but to give you a better Authority than mine, if
your Sister will look into her <HI>French</HI> Bible, she will
find it translated thus, <HI>Even in his Son Jesus Christ:</HI>
Making a Stop there, he, as it were, begins again
thus; <HI>He is the True God,</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so indeed.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[She turns to the Text, and reads it
thus; <HI>Son fils</HI> JESU CHRIST;
<HI>il est le Vrai</HI> DIEU &amp; <HI>la Vie
Eternalle.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to confirm it still farther, and in which
both Translations agree, he is in the same Verse
called the Truth, or <HI>him that is True,</HI> where God is
first called <HI>Him that is True,</HI> and then Jesus Christ
is called by the same Title; see the Text: <HI>We
know the Son of</HI> GOD <HI>is come,</HI> and <HI>hath given us an
Understanding,</HI> that we may know <HI>Him that is True:</HI>
Note, that is to know GOD, as the next Words will
prove, <HI>viz. And we are in him that is True;</HI> even,
(or, as the <HI>French</HI> read it, THAT IS TO SAY) <HI>in his
Son</HI> JESUS CHIST HE <HI>is, or</HI> WHO <HI>is, the True</HI> GOD,
and <HI>Life Eternal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surprized at this Explanation,
but 'tis plain the <HI>French</HI> Translators do read it
so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I think, our Translation is as plain,
that Jusus Christ is here called <HI>Him that is True,</HI>
just as GOD is called <HI>Him that is True,</HI> the very same
Words, and with the same Emphasis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="364" REF="378"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is the Testimony that our Lord
gives of himself in this particular Case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have mentioned already, that he testified of
himself, that he was <HI>the</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the Son of the</HI>
LIVING GOD, and He and the Father <HI>are</HI> ONE;
What can be more?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I mistake not, he calls himself also <HI>the</HI>
TRUTH <HI>and the</HI> LIGHT, <HI>the</HI> WAY, <HI>the</HI> LIFE.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and commands us, upon Pain of Dam∣nation,
to believe <HI>in him:</HI> Not only to believe what
he says, but to believe <HI>in him;</HI> that is, as is de∣scribed
before, to believe <HI>in him</HI> as in the GOD <HI>of
Truth,</HI> as in the <HI>Messias,</HI> who, as is said, was to be
the <HI>Mighty God,</HI> the <HI>Eternal Father,</HI> and <HI>Prince of
Peace:</HI> See the Texts which are particular to those
Things; <HI>If ye believe not that</HI> I AM HE, <HI>ye shall die
in your Sins,</HI> John viii. 24. <HI>Ye believe in</HI> GOD, <HI>be∣lieve
also</HI> IN ME, John xiv. I. Again, <HI>I am the
Way, the Truth, and the Life,</HI> ver. 6. What is it
to be <HI>the Truth?</HI> And who is <HI>the Truth</HI> but <HI>the</HI> GOD
<HI>of Truth?</HI> Again, in his Words to <HI>Martha,</HI> John xi.
25. <HI>I am the Resurrection and the Life.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cavilling Opposers cast all this off by
their bringing similar Texts, where the like Words
are used in differing Cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But none, where they are used with the
like Authority. St. <HI>John</HI> says, of him, after he had
first asserted his Godhead, <HI>John</HI> i. I. That the Word
<HI>was God.</HI> In the 9th Verse he says, <HI>That was the
true Light which lighteth every Man;</HI> and Jesus
Christ, confirming this, says of himself, <HI>I am the Light
of the World,</HI> John viii. 12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is also said, we should believe <HI>in the Light,</HI>
John xii. 36. <HI>While ye have the Light believe in the
Light.</HI> Who is signified there by the Word
LIGHT?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It plainly means CHRIST as GOD; for
St. <HI>John</HI> says expressly, as quoted above, That <HI>the
<PB N="365" REF="379"/>
Word,</HI> that is Christ, <HI>was</HI> GOD; that he was THE
LIGHT, and Christ says of himself, that he is THE
LIGHT; and here it is said, We should believe <HI>in</HI>
THE LIGHT, that is, IN GOD.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are abundance such Texts as these,
but they cavil them off, as I said, by parallel
Places.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If parallel Texts shall be taken for Explana∣tions,
then all these Texts being so parallel to one
another, and proving Christ to be the <HI>Messias,</HI>
proving the <HI>Messias</HI> to be GOD, and that therfore
Christ is the same TRUE GOD, as the <HI>Messias,</HI> have
likewise the same Authority, and receive the same
Sanction from their Agreement with parallel Texts,
and in parallel Cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge it is clear to me, but in
nothing more than that we are commanded to be∣lieve
<HI>in</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>in</HI> the LIGHT, which is
CHRIST, and nothing but GOD, as you say, is the
Object of Faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not desirous to enter here into their Ca∣villings
at the Scripture which they lay so much
Stress upon; not but that the plain understanding of
Scripture is evidently against them, and all their
Refuge lies in corrupting the Interpretation; but
because the very Nature of the Thing is against
them, if the Scripture is to be searched, and the
Scriptures do sufficiently testify of Christ, as our Sa∣viour
himself expresses it. Is it likely that GOD
would have left his Church under the Conduct of a
false Light so many Hundred Years?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that we should not to this Day have a
true Reading, and a just Interpretation of the
Text?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had the Apostles, who dictated the holy
Scriptures, which we call the Gospel? I say, had
they the Gift of Tongues, and yet could not ex∣press
<PB N="366" REF="380"/>
the Truths of God which they received, I
say, Could not they express them in an intelligible
Manner? Is not the First Chapter of St. <HI>John's</HI>
Gospel exprest in Words plain and intelligible? Is
it not expressly affirmed there, that by the <HI>Word</HI>
is meant the eternal Word, that is, Christ; Was it
not so understood by all Nations, received so in all
Languages, and rendered so in every Translation?
Is it not of that Word said expressly, The <HI>Word</HI> was
GOD? and is not then CHRIST <HI>the Word,</HI> which
was GOD?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say all Nations understand it so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Opposers do not deny it, at least, as
ever I found in any of their Writings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same GOD and WORD is called <HI>the
Light, ver.</HI> 9. of the same Chapter, as before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and Christ calls himself <HI>the Light;</HI> I
am <HI>the Light of the World.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and he says, He that receives the Light
shall not walk in Darkness, and that <HI>in him is no
Darkness at all.</HI> And have not the whole Church
walked in Darkness, if we have till now been left to
a doubtful and undetermined Reading of the Scrip∣tures
in these essential Articles of the Christian
Faith?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are like to do so still, a great many
Years; for a famous and Learned Defender of these
Objections insists, That Learned Men should be
brought together to settle the Interpretation of those
Texts, for that it will require many Years to search
into the ancient Fathers, and to reconcile the diffe∣rent
Readings, and different Interpretations, and to
understand clearly the Meaning of the Words in the
several Texts concerning this Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So all the World, notwithstanding we have had
<HI>the Light of the World</HI> to illuminate and instruct us;
have, to this Day, <HI>walked in Darkness,</HI> and that
<PB N="367" REF="381"/>
good Spirit of Truth, the Guide and Comforter of
his People, who our blessed Lord promised to send,
and did send, to <HI>lead us unto all Truth,</HI> has left us
still in the Dark, and has not led us at all into the
Truth: Horrid Suggestion! that Christ has not per∣formed
his Word, that the Promise of the Father is
not yet given; or if it be, has not performed the
particular Office which it was promised to be given
for, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to enlighten the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>But many Years must yet be spent to exa∣mine
the Sense of the Fathers, to understand the
different Readings, and, in a Word, to explain the
Text to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And all the poor doubting Souls who are be∣wildred
by Uncertainties, and amused by the
Learned Perplexities of these Men, must live, nay,
which is worse, must die, in the same Uncertainty;
not knowing <HI>in whom they have believed,</HI> who to
pray to, how to denominate him; and, in a
Word, whether their Saviour is really God or
Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Till these learned Casuists have met from
all Parts of the World, have consulted all the differ∣ing
Opinions, compared the differing Readings of
every disputed Text, and ascertained those Things
which, it should seem, the infallible Spirit of God
either could not, or, at least, has not thought fit
to determine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we have a much better Way to come
at a clear Understanding in all those Things, and
which the Scripture itself seems to direct us to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daugh.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Way is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to read the Scriptures diligently; search
into the Book of God with Attention; This is the
only sure Way to attain a sacred Knowledge in Di∣vine
Mysteries, at the same Time praying to God,
in a meek and humble Manner, to enlighten our
<PB N="368" REF="382" MS="y"/>
Darkness by the Illumination of his holy Spirit, and
that this blessed Spirit may fully and essentially re∣veal
Christ to us; which Prayer, sincerely put up
in the Name of Christ, and in the Faith of the Pro∣mise
which our blessed Lord made to us, That he
would <HI>send his Spirit to us,</HI> that it should <HI>be with us
to the End of the World,</HI> we may safely depend
upon, and can have no Reason to doubt will be
heard.</P>
</SP>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE anxious Parent of this well instructed
Family, having ended these Discourses; and,
as he had Reason to believe, with Success, he left the
Book of the Reverend Mr. <HI>David Martin</HI> with them,
for their farther Direction; folding down the
Leaves at the proper Places, which he had recom∣mended
to their Reading.</P>
<P>When he was going away, he recollected that he
had made a serious Poem upon the very Subject
which he had been discoursing of (<HI>viz.</HI>) The Deity
of Christ; and pulling it out of his Pocket, he read
it to them, being in Blank Verse, after the Manner
of Mr. <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P>His Children were so pleased with it, that they
begg'd him to leave that with them too, for their
more leisurely Reading, which accordingly he did,
and I have therefore inserted it here, as a Conclusion
to the Work, as follows.</P>
