<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Lover's Eye.</HEAD>
<P>THE serenity of virtue would now again have made
its abode the breast of Mr. Tyrold, but for the con∣stant
wretchedness to which he saw his daughter a
prey. With the benignest pity he strove to revive
her; a pity unabated by-any wonder, unalloyed with
any blame. His wonder fell all upon Edg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, whom
he considered as refining away mortal happiness, by
dissatisfaction that it was not divine; but his censure;
which he reserved wholly for vice, ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nerated them
both. Still however, he flattered himself that ere
long, to-her youthful mind and native chearfulness,
tranquillity, if not felicity, would imperceptibly re∣turn,
from such a union for exertion of filial and sis∣terly
duties: that industry would sweeten rest, virtue
gild privation, and self-approvance convert every sa∣crifice
into enjoyment.</P>
<P>But peace such as this was far from her bosom.
While the desertion of Edgar had tolled the death
bell to all her hopes, an unremitting contention dis∣turbed
her mind, whether to avow or conceal her situ∣ation
with regard to the money-lender. The r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>flecti∣ons
of every night brought a dissatisfaction in her con∣duct,
which determined her upon an openness the most
undisguised for the following morning: but timidity,
and the desire of reprieve from the fearful task, again,
the following morning, regularly postponed her pur∣pose.</P>
<P>In the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> horror occasioned by her father's distress
from the bills of her brother, she wrote a supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icating
letter to Mrs. Mittin, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she would endeavour
to quiet her creditors till she could arrange something
for their payment. And while this produced a cor∣respondence
replete with danger, difficulty, and im∣propriety,
a new circumstance occurred, which yet
more cruelly embittered her conflicting emotions.
<PB N="176" REF="3"/>
Lavinia, in the virtuous eagerness of her heart to
forward the general oeconomy, insisted wholly to re∣linquish,
for this year, her appropriate allowance;
declaring that, by careful management, she could dis∣pense
with any thing new, and that the very few ex∣pences
she might find utterly unavoidable, she would
demand from time to time as they occurred. Camilla,
at this proposition, retreated, in agony, to her chamber.
To make the same was impossible; for how, then,
find interest for the money-lender? yet to withstand
so just an example, seemed a disgrace to every duty
and every feeling.</P>
<P>Lavinia, who, in her countenance and abrupt de∣parture,
read the new distress she had incautiously ex∣cited,
with a thousand self-reproaches followed her.
She had considered but the common cause when she
spoke, without weighing the strange appearance of not
being seconded by her sister: But her mind was
amongst the last to covet the narrow praise of insidi∣ous
comparison; and her concern for the proposal she
had made, when she saw its effect, was as deep as
that of Camilla in hearing it, though not attended
with the same aggravations.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold remained utterly surprised. The gene∣rous
and disinterested nature of Camilla, made it im∣possible
to suspect her restrained by a greater love of
money than Lavinia; and he could not endure to sup∣pose
her late visits to public places, had rendered per∣sonal
oeconomy more painful. But he would make no
enquiry that might seem a reproach; nor suffer any
privation or contribution that was not chearful and
voluntary.</P>
<P>The purchases for the wedding of Miss Dennel
being now made, that young lady came down to the coun∣try
to solemnize her nuptials, accompanied by Mrs.
Mittin, who instantly visited Camilla. She could
settle nothing, she said, with the money-lender, with∣out
the premium; but she had coaxed all the creditors,
by assuring them, that, as the debtor was a great
<PB N="177" REF="4"/>
heiress, they were certain of their money when she
came to her estate. Camilla could not endure to owe
their forbearance to a falshood; though to convince
Mrs. Mittin of her errour, in contradiction to the assertion
of Lionel, was a vain attempt. The business, how∣ever,
pressed; and to keep back these but too just
claimants was her present most fervent desire. Mrs.
Mittin was amongst the most expert of expedient∣mongers,
and soon started a method for raising the
premium. She asked to look at what Camilla pos∣sessed
of trinkets: and the prize ear-rings of Tun∣bridge,
the ear-rings and necklace of Southampton,
and several small toys occasionally given her, were
collected. The locket she also demanded, to make
weight; but neither that, nor the peculiar gifts, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
keep-sakes, of her father, mother, or uncle, consist∣ing
of a seal, a ring, and a watch, would she part
with. What she would relinquish, however, Mrs.
Mittin disposed of to one of her numerous friends▪
but they raised only, when intrinsically valued, six∣teen
pounds. Lavinia then insisted upon coming for∣ward
with a contribution of every trinket she was
worth, save what had the same sacred motives of
detention: and the twenty pounds, without any cere∣mony
of acknowledgment, were delivered to Mr.
Clykes; who then took into his own hands the pay∣ment
of the hundred and eighteen pounds; for which
he received a bond, signed by Camilla, and witnessed
by Mrs. Mittin; and another note of hand, promising
ten per cent. interest for the sum, till the principal
were repaid. These two notes, he acknowledged,
were mere pledges of honour, as the law would treat
her as an infant; but he never acted without them, as
they prevented mistakes in private dealings.</P>
<P>This important affair arranged, Camilla felt some∣what
more at ease; she was relieved from hourly
alarms, and left the mistress to make her confession as
circumstances directed. But she obtained not for no∣thing
the agency of Mrs. Mittin, who was not a cha∣racter
to leave self out of consideration in her trans∣actions
for others; and at every visit made at Ether∣ington
<PB N="178" REF="5"/>
from this time, she observed some thing in
the apparel of Camilla that was utterly old fashion∣ed,
or too mean for her to wear; but which would
do well enough for herself, when vamped up, as she
knew how. Her obligations and inexperience
made it impossible to her to resist, though, at this
season of saving care, she gave up nothing which
she could not have rendered useful by industry and
contrivance.</P>
<P>During this unhappy period at Etherington, a
brighter, though not unclouded scene, was exhi∣bited
at Cleves. Melmond arrived; he was per∣mitted
to pay his addresses to the fair Indiana, and
believed felicity celestial accorded to him even
upon earth.</P>
<P>But this adored object herself suffered some se∣vere
repining at her fate, when she saw, from her
window, her lover gallop into the park without
equipage, without domestics, and mounted on a
hired horse. The grimacing shrugs of Miss Marg∣land
shewed she entered into this mortification;
and they were nearly conspiring to dismiss the ig∣noble
pretender, when a letter, which he modest∣ly
sent up, from his sister, inviting Indiana to pass
a few weeks in Grosvenor Square, once again se∣cured
the interest of the brother. She suffered,
therefore, Sir Hugh to hand her down stairs, and
the enamoured Melmond thought himself the most
blest of men.</P>
<P>The sight of such eager enjoyment, and the
really amiable qualities of this youth, soon com∣pletely
reconciled the Baronet to this new business;
for he saw no reason, he said, in fact, why one
niece had not as good a right to be married first as
another. The generous and sentimental Eugenia
never ceased her kind offices, and steadily wore an
air of tolerable chearfulness all day, though her
pillow was nightly wetted with tears for her un∣fortunate
lot.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="6"/>
Nor, with all her native equanimity and acquir∣ed
philosophy, was this a situation to bring back
sere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity. The enthusiastic raptures of Melmond
elevated him, in her eyes, to something above hu∣man;
and while his adoration of Indiana presented
to her a picture of all she thought most fascinating,
his grateful softness of respect to herself was pene∣tratingly
touching to her already conquered heart.</P>
<P>Indiana, meanwhile, began ere long, to catch
some of the pleasure she inspired. The passionate
animation of Melmond, soon not only resumed its
first power, but became even essential to her. No
one else had yet seemed to think her so completely
a goddess, except Mr. Macdersey, whom she scarce
expected ever to see again. With Melmond she
could do nothing that did not make her appear to
him still more lovely: and though her whims, thus
indulged, became almost endless, they but kindled
with fresh flame his admiration. If she fretted, he
thought her all sensibility; if she pouted, all digni∣ty;
if her laughter was unmeaning, she was made
up of innocent gaiety: if what she said was shallow,
he called her the child of pure nature; if she were
angry, how becoming was her spirit! if illiberal,
how noble was her frankness! her person charmed
his eye, but his own imagination framed her mind,
and while his enchanted faculties were the mere
slaves of her beauty, they persuaded themselves they
were vanquished by every other perfection.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold had not yet related Edgar's defec∣tion
to Sir Hugh; though from the moment the
time of hope was past, he wished to end that of
expectation. But the pressure of the affairs of
Lionel detained him at Etherington, and he could
not bear to give grief to his brother, till he could
soften its effect by the consolation of some residence
at Cleves. This time now arrived; and the next
day was fixed for his painful task, in which he
meant to spare Camilla any share, when Jacob
<PB N="180" REF="7"/>
begged immediate admittance into the study,
where Mr. Tyrold and his daughters were drink∣ing
tea.</P>
<P>His scared look instantly announced ill news.
Mr. Tyrold was alarmed, Lavinia was frightened,
and Camilla exclaimed, “Jacob, speak at once.!”</P>
<P>He begged to sit down.</P>
<P>Camilla ran to get him a chair.</P>
<P>“Is my brother well, Jacob?” cried Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>“Why, pretty well, considering, Sir,—but
these are vast bad times for us!”</P>
<P>“O! if my uncle is but well,” cried Camilla,
relieved from her first dreadful doubt, “all, I
hope, will do right!”</P>
<P>“Why, ay, Miss,” said Jacob, smiling, “I
knew you'd be master's best comfort; and so I
told him, and so he says, for that matter himself,
as I've got to tell you from him. But, for all that,
he takes on prodigious bad. I never saw him in
the like way, except just that time when Miss
Geny had the small pox.”</P>
<P>They all supplicated him to forbear further com∣ments,
and then gathered, that a money-agent,
employed by young Lynmere, had just arrived at
Cleves; where, with bitter complaints, he related
that, having been duped into believing him heir to
Sir Hugh Tyrold, he had been prevailed with to
grant him money, from time to time, to pay cer∣certain
bills, contracted not only there, but in
London, for goods sent thence by his order, to the
amount of near thirteen hundred pounds, without
the interest, of which he should give a separate
account; that he had vainly applied to the young
gentleman for re-imbursement, who finally assured
him he was just disinherited by his uncle. No
hope, therefore, remained to save him from the
ruin of this affair, but in the compassion of the
Boronet, which he now came to most humbly
solicit.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="8"/>
While Mr. Tyrold, in silent surprise and con∣cern,
listened to an account that placed his brother
in difficulties so similar his own, Camilla, sinking
back in her chair, looked pale, looked almost life∣less.
The history of the debts she already knew,
and had daily expected to hear; but the circum∣stance
of the money lender, and the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usion con∣cerning
the inheritance, so resembled her own ter∣rible,
and yet unknown story, that she felt per∣sonally
involved in all the shame and horror of the
relation.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who believed her suffering all for
her uncle, made further enquiries, while Lavinia
tenderly sustained her, “Don't take on so, dear
Miss,” said Jacob, “for all our hope is in you,
as Master and I both said; and he bid me tell your
papa, that if he'd only give young 'Squire Man∣dlebert
a jog, to egg him on, that he might no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
be so shilly shally, as soon as ever the wedding's
over, he'd accept his kind invitation to Beech
Park, and bide there till he got clear, as one
may say.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now required no assigned motive for
the excessive distress of his daughter, and hastened
to turn Jacob from this too terribly trying sub∣ject,
by saying, “My brother then means to pay
these demands?”</P>
<P>“Lauk, yes, Sir! his honour pays every thing
as any body asks him; only he says he don't know
how, because of having no more money, being
so hard run with all our preparations we have
been making this last fortnight.”</P>
<P>Camilla, with every moment encreasing agita∣tion,
hid her face against Lavinia; but Mr.
Tyrold, with some energy, said: The interest, at
least, I hope he will not discharge; for those dan∣gerous
vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or
erring, to encourage their frailties or vices, by
affording them means to pursue them, deserve
much severer punishment than merely losing a
recompence for their iniquitous snares.”</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="9"/>
This was quite too much for the already disor∣ordered
Camilla; she quitted her sister, glided out
of the room, and delivered herself over as a prey
no longer to sorrow but remorse. Her conduct
seemed to have been precisely the conduct of
Clermont, and she felt herself dreadfully implicated
as one of the <HI>weak or erring,</HI> guilty of <HI>frailties or vices.</HI></P>
<P>That an uncle so dearly loved should believe she
was forming an establishment which would afford
him an asylum during his difficulties, now every
prospect of that establishment was over, was so
heart-piercing a circumstance, that to her father
it seemed sufficient for the whole of what she en∣dured.
He made her over, therefore, to Lavinia,
while he hastened to Cleves; for Jacob, when he
had said all he was ordered to say, all he had ga∣thered
himself, and all he was able to suggest,
finished with letting him know that his master
begged he would set out that very moment.</P>
<P>The time of his absence was spent by Camilla
in an anguish, that at his return, seemed quite to
have changed her. He was alarmed, and redoubled
his tenderness; but his tenderness was no longer
her joy. He knows not, she thought, whom he
caresses; knows not that the wounds just beginning
to heal for the son, are soon to be again opened for
the daughter!</P>
<P>Yet her affections were all awake to enquire
after her uncle; and when she heard that nothing
could so much sooth him as her sight, all fear of
his comments, all terror of exertion, subsided in
the possible chance of consoling him: and Mr.
Tyrold, who thought every act of duty led
to chearfulness, sent to desire the carriage might
fetch her the next morning.</P>
<P>He passed slightly over to Camilla the scene he
had himself gone through; but he confessed to
Lavinia its difficulty and pain. Sir Hugh had ac∣knowledged
he had drawn his bankers dry, yet
had merely current cash to go on till the next
quarter, whence he intended to deduct the further
<PB N="183" REF="10"/>
expences of the weddings. Nevertheless, he was
determined upon paying every shilling of the de∣demand,
not only for the debts, but for all the
complicate interest. He would not listen to any
reasoning upon this subject, because, he said, he
had it upon his conscience that the first fault was
his own, in letting poor Clermont leave the king∣dom,
without clearing up to him that he had made
Eugenia his exclusive heiress. It was in vain Mr.
Tyrold pointed out, that no future hopes of wealth
could exculpate this unauthorized extravagance in
Clermont, and no dissipation in Clermont could
apologize for the clandestine in Clermont could
apologize for the clandestine loan, and its illegal
interest: “The poor boy,' said he, did it all,
knowing no better, which how can I expect, when
I did wrong myself, being his uncle? Though if I
were to have twenty more nephews and nieces in
future, the first word I should say to them would
be to tell them I should give them nothing; to the
end that having no hope, they might all be happy
one as another.” All, therefore, that was left for
Mr. Tyrold, was to counsel him upon the best
and shortest means of raising the sum; and for this
purpose, he meant to be with him again the next
day.</P>
<P>This affair, however, with all its reproach for
the past▪ and all its sacrifices for the time to come,
by no means so deeply affected Sir Hugh as the
blow Mr. Tyrold could no longer spare concern∣ing
Edgar. It sunk to his heart, dispirited him
to tears, and sent him, extremely ill, to bed.</P>
<P>The chaise came early the next morning, and
Mr. Tyrold had the pleasure to see Camilla exert
herself to appear less sad. Lavinia was also of the
party, as he meant to stay the whole day.</P>
<P>Eugenia met them in the hall, with the welcome
intelligence that Sir Hugh, though he had passed a
wretched night, was now somewhat better, and
considerably cheared, by a visit from his old York∣shire
friend, Mr. Westwyn.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, Sir Hugh dismissed him, and eve∣ry
body else, to receive Camilla alone.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="11"/>
She endeavoured to approach him calmly, but his
own unchecked emotions soon overset her borrowed
fortitude, and the interview proved equally afflicting
to both. The cruel mischiefs brought upon him by
Clermont, were as nothing in the balance of his mis∣fortunes,
when opposed to the sight of sorrow upon
that face which, hitherto, had so constantly enlivened
him as an image of joy: and with her, every self-disappointment
yielded, for the moment, to the regret
of losing so precious a blessing, as offering a refuge,
in a time of difficulty, to an uncle so dear to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would not suffer this scene to be long
uninterrupted; he entered, with a chearing counte∣nance,
that compelled them to dry their tears, and
told them the Westwyns could not so much longer be
lest out, though they remained, well contented, for
the present, with Miss Margland and his other daugh∣ters.
“Melmond and Indiana,” added he, smiling,
“seem at present not beings of this lower sphere, nor
to have a moment to spare for those who are.”</P>
<P>“That, my dear brother,” answered the Baronet,
“is all my comfort; for as to all the rest of my mar∣rying,
you see what it's come to! who could have
thought of young Mr. Edgar's turning out in the same
way? I can't say but what I take it pretty unkind of
him, letting me prepare at this rate for nothing; be∣sides
Beech Park's being within but a stone's throw,
as one may say, as well as his own agreeableness.
However, now l've seen a little more of the world,
I can't say I find much difference between the good and
the bad, with respect to their all doing alike. The
young boys now-a-days, whatever's come to 'em,
don't know what they'd be at. They think nothing of
disappointing a person if once they have a mind to
change their minds. All one's preparations go for
nothing; which they never think of.”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now prevailed for the re-admission of
Mr. Westwyn, who was accompanied by his son, and
followed by the Cleves family.</P>
<P>The cheeks of Camilla recovered their usual hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at the sight of Henry, from the various interesting
<PB N="185" REF="12"/>
recollections which occurred with it. She was seen
herself with their original admiration, both by the
father and the son, though with the former it was now
mingled with anger, and with the latter no longer
gilded with hope. Yet the complaints against her,
which, upon his arrival, Mr. Westwyn meant to make,
were soon not merely relinquished, but transformed
into pity, upon the view of her dejected countenance,
and silent melancholy.</P>
<P>The Baronet, however, revived again, by seeing
his old friend, whose humour so much resembled his
own, that, in Yorkshire, he had been always his first
favourite. Each the children of untutored nature, ho∣nest
and open alike in their words and their dealings,
their characters and their propensities were nearly the
same, though Sir Hugh, more self-formed, had a lan∣guage
and manner of his own; and Mr. Westwyn, of
a temper less equal and less gentle, gave way, as they
arose, to such angry passions as the indulgent Baronet
never felt.</P>
<P>“My dear friend,” said Mr. Westwyn, “you
don't take much notice of my Hal, though, I'll give you
my word, you won't see such another young fellow
every day. However, it's as well not, before his
face, for it might only make him think himself some∣body:
and that, while I am alive, I don't intend he
should do. I can't bear a young fellow not dutiful.
I've always a bad opinion of him. I can't say he
pleases me.</P>
<P>“My dear Westwyn,” answered the Baronet, “I've
no doubt but what master Hal is very good, for which
I am truly glad. But as to much over rejoicing, now,
upon the score of young boys, it's what I can't do,
seeing they've turned out so ill, one after another, as
far as I have had to do with them: for which, how∣ever,
I hope I bear 'em no malice: They've enough
to answer for without that, which, I hope, they'll
think of in time.”</P>
<P>“Why to be sure, Sir Hugh, if you set about
thinking of a young fellow by the pattern of my friend
Clermont, I can't say I'm much surprised you don't
<PB N="186" REF="13"/>
care to give him a good word; I can't say I am. I
am pretty much of the same way of thinking. I love
to speak the truth.” He then took Mr. Tyrold apart;
and ran on with a history of all he had gathered, while
at Leipsie, of the conduct and way of life of Cler∣mont
Lynmere. “He was a disgrace,” said he, “even
to the English name, as a Professor told me, that I
can't remember the name of, it's so prodig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous long;
but, if it had not been for my son, he told me, they'd
have thought all the English young fellows good for
nothing, except extravagance, and eating and drink∣ing▪
`They'd all round have got an ill name,' says
he, `if it had not been for your son,' were his words
which I shall never forget. I sent him over a noble
pipe of Madeira, which I'd just got for myself, as
soon as I came home. I took to him very much, I
can't say but I did; he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was a very good man; he had
prodigiously the look of an Englishman. He said Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was an ornament to the university. I took it very well
of him. I wish he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not such a hard name. I can
never call it to mind. I hate a hard name. I can
never speak it without a blunder.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now, who had been talking with Henry,
called upon Mr. Westwyn, to beg his pardon for not
speaking of him more respectfully, saying: “I see
he's quite agreeable, which I should have noticed from
the first, only being what I did not know; which I
hope is my excuse; my head, my dear friend, not
getting on much, in point of quickness: though I can't
say its for want of pains, since you and I used to live
so much together; but to no great end, for I always
find myself in the back, however it happens; which
your son, Master Hal, is, I see, quite the contrary.”</P>
<P>Mr. Westwyn was so much gratified by this praise,
that he immediately confessed the scheme and wish he
had formed of marrying Hal to Camilla, only for her
not approving it. Sir Hugh protested nothing could
give him more pleasure than such a connexion, and sig∣nificantly
added, he had other nieces, besides Camilla.</P>
<P>“Why, yes,” said Mr. Westwyn, “and I can't
keep from looking at 'em; I like 'em all mightily.
<PB N="187" REF="14"/>
I'm a great friend to taking from a good stock. I chuse
to know what I'm about. That girl at Southampton
hit my fancy prodigiously. But I'm not for the beau∣ty.
A beauty won't make a good wife. It takes her
too much time to put her cap on. That little one,
there, with the hump, which I don't mind, nor the
limp, neither, I like vastly. But I'm afraid Hal
won't take to her. A young man don't much fancy an
ugly girl. He's always hankering after something
pretty. There's that other indeed, Miss Lavinia, is
as handsome a girl as I'd wish to see. And she seems
as good, too. However, I'm not for judging all by
the eye. I'm past that. An old man should not play
the fool▪ Which I wish somebody would whisper to
a certain Lord that I know of, that don't behave quite
to my mind. I'm not fond of an old fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l; nor a
young one neither. They make me sick.”</P>
<P>Sir Hugh heard and agreed to all this, with the
same simplicity with which it was spoken; and, soon
after, Yorkshire becoming their them<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Mr. Tyrold
had the pleasure of seeing his brother so much re∣animated
by the revival of old scenes, ideas, and con∣nexions,
that he heartily joined in pressing the Mr.
Westwyns to spend a fortnight at Cleves, to which
they consented with pleasure.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Bride's Resolves.</HEAD>
<P>WITH every allowance for a grief in which so
deeply he shared, Mr Tyrold felt nearly bowed down
with sorrow, when he observed his own tenderness
abate of its power to console, and his exhortations of
their influence with his miserable daughter, whose
complicated afflictions seemed desperate to herself, and
to him nearly hopeless.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="15"/>
He now began to fear the rigid oeconomy and re∣tirement
of their present lives might add secret disgust
or fatigue to the disappointment of her heart. He
sighed at an idea so little in unison with all that had
hitherto appeared of her disposition; yet remembered
she was very young and very lively, and thought that,
if caught by a love of gayer scenes than Ethering<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
afforded, she was at a season of life which brings its
own excuse for such venial ambition.</P>
<P>He mentioned, therefore, with great kindness, their
exclusion from all society, and proposed making an ap∣plication
to Mrs. Needham, a lady high in the esteem
of Mrs. Tyrold, to have the goodness to take she
charge of carrying them a little into the world, dur∣ing
the absence of their mother. “I can neither
exact nor desire,” he said, “to sequester you from all
amusement for a term so utterly indefinite as that of
her restoration; since it is now more than ever desira∣ble
to regain the favour of your uncle Relvil for Lio∣nel,
who has resisted every profession for which I
have sought to prepare him; though his idle and li∣centious
courses so little fit him for contentment with
the small patrimony he will one day inherit.”</P>
<P>The sisters mutually and sincerely declined this
proposition; Lavinia had too much employment to find
time ever slow of passage; and Camilla, joined to the
want of all spirit for recreation, had a dread of appear∣ing
in the county, lest she should meet with Sir Sedley
Clarendel, whose two hundred pounds were amongst
the evils ever present to her. The money which
Eugenia meant to save for this account had all been
given to Lionel; and now her marriage was at an
end, and no particular sum expected, she must be ve∣ry
long in replacing it; especially as Jacob was first
to be considered; though he had kindly protested he
was in no haste to be paid.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was not sorry to have his proposition
declined; yet saw the sadness of Camilla unabated,
and suggested, for a transient diversity, a visit to the
Grove; enquiring why an acquaintance begun with so
much warmth and pleasure, seemed thus utterly relin∣quished.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="16"/>
Camilla had herself thought with shame of
her apparently ungrateful neglect of Mrs. Arlbery;
but the five guineas she had borrowed, and forgotten to
pay, while she might yet have asked them of Sir
Hugh, and which now she had no ability any where
to raise, made the idea of meeting with her painful.
And thus, overwhelmed with regret and repentance
for all around, her spirits gone, and her heart sunk,
she desired never more, except for Cleves, to stir from
Etherington.</P>
<P>Had he seen the least symptom of her revival, Mr.
Tyrold would have been gratified by her strengthened
love of home; but this was far from being the case;
and, upon the marriage of Miss Dennel, which was
now celebrated, he was glad of an opportunity to
force her abroad, from the necessity of making a con∣gratulatory
visit to the bride's aunt, Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>The chariot, therefore, of Sir Hugh being borrow∣ed,
she was compelled into this exertion; she was ill
repaid by her reception from Mrs. Arlbery, who, hurt
as well as offended by her long absence and total si∣lence,
wore an air of the most chilling coldness.
Camilla felt sorry and ashamed, but too much disturb∣ed
to attempt any palliation for her non-appearance,
and remissness of even a note or message.</P>
<P>The room was full of morning visitors, all collect∣ed
for the same complimentary purpose; but she was
relieved with respect to her fears of Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel,
in hearing of his tour to the Hebrides.</P>
<P>Her mournful countenance soon, however, dispers∣ed
the anger of Mrs. Arlbery. “What,” cried she,
“has befallen you, my fair friend? if you are not
immeasurably unhappy, you are very seriously ill.”</P>
<P>“Yes,—no,—my spirits—have not been good—”
answered she, stammering;—“but yours may, per∣haps,
assist to restore them.”</P>
<P>The composition of Mrs. Arlbery had no particle of
either malice or vengeance; she now threw off, there∣fore,
all reserve, and taking her by the hand, said:
“shall I keep you to spend the day with me? Yes or
no? Peace or war?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="17"/>
And without waiting for an answer, she sent back
the chariot, and a message to Mr. Tyrold, that she
would carry home his daughter in the evening.</P>
<P>“And now, my faithless Fair,” cried she, as soon
as they were alone, “tell me what has led you to this
abominable fickleness? with me, I mean! If you had
grown tired of any body else, I should have thought
nothing so natural. But you know, I suppose, that
the same thing we philosophise into an admirable good
joke for our neighbours, we moralise into a crime
against ourselves.”</P>
<P>“I thought,” said Camilla, attempting to smile,
“none but country counsins ever made apologies?”</P>
<P>“Nay, now, I must forgive you without one word
more!” answered Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, and shaking
hands with her; “a happy citation of one <HI>bon mot,</HI>
is worth any ten offences. So, you see, you have
nine to commit, in store, clear of all damages. But
the pleasure of finding one has not said a good thing
only for once, thence to be forgotten and die away in
the winds, is far greater than you can yet a while con∣ceive.
In the first pride of youth and beauty, our at∣tention
is all upon how we are looked at. But when
those begin to be somewhat on the wane—when that
barbarous time comes into play, which revenges upon
poor miserable woman all the airs she has been playing
upon silly man—our ambition, then, is how we are
listened to. So now, cutting short reproach and ex∣cuse,
and all the wearying round of explanation, tell
me a little of your history since we last met.”</P>
<P>This was the last thing Camilla meant to undertake:
but she began, in a hesitating manner, to speak of her
little debt. Mrs. Arlbery, eagerly interruting her,
insisted it should not be mentioned, adding, “I go on
vastly well again; I am breaking in two ponies, and
building a new phaeton; and I shall soon pay for both,
without the smallest inconvenience,—except just pinch∣ing
my servants, and starving my visitors. But tell
me something of your adventures. You are not half
so communicative as Rumour, which has given me a
thousand details of you, and married you and your
<PB N="191" REF="18"/>
whole set to at least half a dozen men a piece, since
you were last at the Grove. Amongst others, it as∣serts,
that my old Lord Valhurst was seriously at
your feet? That prating Mrs. Mittin, who fastened
upon my poor little niece at Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ridge, and who is
now her factotum, pretends that my lord's own ser∣vants
spoke of it publicly at Mrs. Berlinton's.</P>
<P>This was a fact that, being thus divulged, a very
few questions made impossible to deny; though Ca∣milla
was highly superior to the indelicacy and ingra∣titude
of repaying the preference of any gentleman,
by publishing his rejection.</P>
<P>“And what in the world, my dear child,” said
Mrs. Arlbery, “could provoke you to so wild an
action as refusing him?”</P>
<P>“Good Heaven, Mrs. Arlbery!”</P>
<P>“O, what—you were not in love with him? I
believe not!—but if he was in love with you, take
my word for it, that would have done quite as well.
'Tis such a little while that same love lasts, even
when it is begun with, that you have but a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> few
months to lose, to be exactly upon a par with those
who set out with all the quivers of Cupid, darting
from heart to heart. He has still fortune enough left
for a handsome settlement; you can't help out-living
him, and then, think but how delectable would be
your situation! Freedom, money at will, the choice
of your own friends, and the enjoyment of your own
humour!”</P>
<P>“You would but try me, my dear Mrs. Arlbery;
for you cannot, I'm sure, believe me capable of ma∣king
so solemn an engagement for such mercenary
hopes, and selfish purposes.”</P>
<P>“This is all the romance of false reasoning. You
have not sought the man, but the man you. You
would not have solicited his acceptance, but yielded
to his solicitation of yours. The balance is always
just, where force is not used. The man has his rea∣sons
for chusing you; you have your reasons for suf∣fering
yourself to be chosen. What his are, you have
<PB N="192" REF="19"/>
no business to enquire; nor has he the smallest right
to investigate yours.”</P>
<P>This was by no means the style in which Camilla
had been brought up to think of marrlage; and Mrs.
Arlbery presently added: “You are grave; yet I
speak but as a being of the world I live in: though I
address one that knows nothing about it. Tell me,
however, a little more of your affairs. What are all
these marriages and no marriages, our neighbourhood
is so busy in making and unmaking?</P>
<P>Camilla returned the most brief and quiet answers
in her power; but was too late to save the delicacy
of Eugenia in concealing her late double disappoint∣ments,
the abortive preparations of Sir Hugh having
travelled through all the adjoining country. “Poor
little dear ugly thing!” cried Mrs. Arlbery, “she
must certainly go off with her footman;—unless, in∣deed,
that good old pedant, who teaches her that vast
quantity of stuff she will have to unlearn, when once
she goes a little about, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take compassion upon her
and her thousands, and put them both into his own
pockets.”</P>
<P>This raillery was painful nearly to disgust to Camilla;
who frankly declared she saw her sister with no eyes
but those of respect and affection, and could not en∣dure
to hear her mentioned in so ridiculous a man∣ner.</P>
<P>“Never judge the heart of a wit,” answered she,
laughing, “by the tongue! We have often as good
hearts, ay, and as much good nature, too, as the
careful profers who utter nothing but what is right,
or the heavy thinkers who have too little fancy to say
any thing that is wrong. But we have a pleasure in
our own rattle that cruelly runs away with our dis∣cretion.”</P>
<P>She then more seriously apologized for what she
had said, and declared herself an unaffected admirer
of all she had heard of the good qualities of Eu∣genia.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="20"/>
Other subjects were then taken up, till they were
interrupted by a visit from the young bride, Mrs.
Lissin.</P>
<P>Jumping into the room, “I'm just run away,” she
cried, “without saying a word to any body! I or∣dered
my coach myself, and told my own footman to
whisper me when it came, that I might get off, with∣out
saying a word of the matter. Dear! how they'll
all stare when they miss me! I hope they'll be fright∣ened!”</P>
<P>“And why so, you little chit? why do you want
to make them uneasy?”</P>
<P>“O! I don't mind! I'm so glad to have my
own way, I don't care for any thing else. Dear, how
do you do, Miss Camilla Tyrold? I wonder you
have not been to see me! I had a great mind to have
invited you to have been one of my bride's maids.
But papa was so monstrous cross, he would not let
me do hardly any thing I liked. I was never so glad
in my life as when I went out of the house to be mar∣ried!
I'll never ask him about any one thing as long
as I live again. I'll always do just what I chuse.”</P>
<P>“And you are quite sure Mr. Lissin will never in∣terfere
with that resolution?”</P>
<P>“O, I sha'n't let him! I dare say he would
else. That's one reason I came out so, just now, on
purpose to let him see I was my own mistress. And
I told my coachman, and my own footman, and my
maid, all three, that if they said one word, I'd turn
'em all away. For I intend always to turn 'em away
when I don't like 'em. I shall never say any thing
to Mr. Lissin first, for fear of his meddling. I'm
quite determined I won't be crossed any more, now
I've servants of my own. I'm sure I've been crossed
long enough.”</P>
<P>Then, turning to Camilla, “Dear,” she cried,
“how grave you look! Dear, I wonder you don't
marry too! When I ordered my coach, just now, I
was ready to cry for joy, to think of not having to
ask papa about it. And to-day, at breakfast, I dare
<PB N="194" REF="21"/>
say I rung twenty times, for one thing or another.
As fast as ever I could think of any thing, I went
to ringing again. For when I was at papa's, every
time I rang the bell, he always asked me what I
wanted. Only think of keeping one under so!”</P>
<P>“And what in the world said Mr. Lissin to so
prodigious an uproar?”</P>
<P>“O, he stared like any thing. But he could not
say much: I intend to use him to it from the first,
that he may never plague me, like papa, with
asking me what's the reason for every thing. If I
don't like the dinner to-day, I'll order a new one, to
be dressed for me on purpose. And Mr. Lissin, and
papa, and Mrs. Mittin, and the rest of 'em, may eat
the old one. Papa never let me order the dinner at
home; he always would know what there was himself,
and have what he chose. I'm resolved I'll have every
thing I like best, now, every day. I could not get
at the cook alone this morning, because so many of
'em were in the way; though I rung for her a dozen
times. But to-morrow, I'll tell her of some things
I intend to have the whole year through; in parti∣cular,
currant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arts, and minced veal, and mashed
potatoes. I've been determined upon that these three
years, for against I was married.”</P>
<P>Then, taking Camilla by the hand, she begged she
would accompany her to next room, saying, “Pray
excuse me, aunt Arlbery, because I want to talk to
Miss Tyrold about a secret.”</P>
<P>When they came to another apartment, after care∣fully
shutting the door, “Only think,” she cried,
“Miss Camilla Tyrold, of my marrying Mr. Lissn
at last! Pray did you ever suspect it? I'm sure I did
not. When papa told me of it, you can't think how
I was surprised. I always thought it would have
been Colonel Andover, or Mr. Macdersey, or else
Mr. Summers; unless it had been Mr. Wiggan, or
else your brother; but Mr. Lissin never once came
into my head, because of his being so old. I dare
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay he's seven and twenty! only think!—But I be∣lieve
<PB N="195" REF="22"/>
he and papa had settled it all along, only papa
never told it me, till just before hand. I don't like
him much; do you?”</P>
<P>“I have not the pleasure to know him: but I hope
you will endeavour to like him better, now.”</P>
<P>“I don't much care whether I do or not, for I
shall never mind him. I always determined never to
mind a husband. One minds one's papa because one
can't help it: But only think of my being married
before you! though you're seventeen years old—almost
eighteen—I dare say—and I'm only just fifteen. I
could not help thinking of it all the time I was dres∣sing
for a bride. You can't think how pretty my
dress was. Papa made Mrs. Mittin but it, because,
he said, she could get every thing so cheap: but I
made her get it the dearest she could, for all that.
Papa's monstrous stingy.”</P>
<P>This secret conference was broken up by a violent
ringing at the gate, succeeded by the appearance of
Mr. Lissin, who, without any ceremony, opened the
door of the chamber into which the ladies had re∣tired.</P>
<P>“So, ma'am!” said he, visibly very angry, “I
have the pleasure at last to find you! dinner has wait∣ed
till it is spoilt, and I hope, therefore, now, you
will do us the favour to come and sit at the head of
your table.”</P>
<P>She looked frightened, and he took her hand, which
she had not courage to draw back, though in a voice
that spoke a sob near at hand, “I'm sure,” she cried,
“this is not being treated like a married woman!
and I'm sure if I'd known I might not do as I like,
and come out when I'd a mind, I would not have mar∣ried
at all!”</P>
<P>Mr. Lissin, with little or no apology to Mrs. Arl∣bery,
then conveyed his fair bride to her coach.</P>
<P>“Poor simple girl!” exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery.
“Mr. Lissin, who is a country ▪squire of Northwick,
will soon teach her another lesson, than that of order∣ing
her carriage just at dinner time! The poor child
<PB N="196" REF="23"/>
took it into her head that, because, upon marrying
she might say, `my house, my coach,' and `my
servants,' instead of `my papa's;' and ring her bell
for whom she pleased, and give her own orders, that
she was to arrive at complete liberty and independ∣ence,
and that her husband had merely to give her
his name, and lodge in the same dwelling: and she
will regard him soon, as a tyrant and a brute, for
not letting her play all day long the part of a wild
school girl, just come home for the holidays.”</P>
<P>The rest of the visit passed without further investi∣gation
on the part of Mrs. Arlbery, or embarrass∣ment
on that of Camilla; who found again some lit∣tle
pleasure in the conversation which, at first, had
so much charmed; and the kindness which even her
apparent neglect had not extinguished.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in two days, claimed her again▪
Mr. Tyrold would not permit her to send an excuse,
and she found that lady more kindly disposed to her
than ever; but with an undisguised compassion and
concern in her countenance and manner. She had
now learnt that Edgar was gone abroad; and she had
learnt that Camilla had private debts, to the amount
of one hundred and eighteen pounds.</P>
<P>The shock of Camilla, when spoken to upon this
subject, was terrible. She soon gathered, she had
been betrayed by Mrs. Mittin, who, though she had
made the communication as a profound secret to Mrs.
Arlbery, with whom she had met at Mrs. Lissin's,
there was every reason to suppose would whisper it,
in the same manner, to an hundred persons besides.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, seeing her just uneasiness, promised,
in this particular, to obviate it herself▪ by a confer∣ence
with Mrs. Mittin, in which she would represent,
that her own ruin would be the consequence of di∣vulging
this affair, from the general opinion which
would prevail, that she had seduced a young lady un∣der
age, to having dealings with a usurer.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="24"/>
Camilla, deeply colouring, accepted her kind offer;
but was forced upon a confession of the transaction;
though with a shame for her trust in such a character
as Mrs. Mittin, that made her deem the relation a pe∣nance
almost adequate to its wrong.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Workings of Sorrow.</HEAD>
<P>THE visit of the Westwyns to Sir Hugh shewe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Lavinia in so favourable a light, that nothing less than
the strong prepossession already conceived for Camilla
could have guarded the heart of the son, or the wish∣es
of the father, from the complete captivation of her
modest beauty, her intrinsie worth, and the chearful
alacrity, and virtuous self-denial, with which she pre∣sided
in the new oeconomy of the rectory. But though
the utter demolition of hope played with Henry its usual
part of demolishing, also, half the fervour of admira∣tion,
he still felt, in consequence of his late failure▪
a distaste of any similar attempt: and Mr. Westwyn,
unbribed by the high praise of his son, which had
won him in Camilla, left him master of his choice.
Each, however, found a delight in the Tyrold society,
that seconded the wishes of the Baronet to make them
lengthen their visit.</P>
<P>The retrenchments, by which the debts of Cler∣mont
were to be paid, could no longer, nevertheless,
be deferred; and Mr. Tyrold was just setting out for
Cleves, to give his counsel for their arrangement, when
his daughters were broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin.</P>
<P>Camilla could scarcely look at her, for displeasure
at her conduct; but soon observed she seemed herself
full of resentment and ill humour. She desired a pri∣vate
interview; and Camilla then found, that Mrs.
Arlbery had not only represented her fault, and fright∣ened
her with its consequences, but occasioned, though
most undesignedly, new disturbances and new dangers
<PB N="198" REF="25"/>
to herself: for Mrs. Mittin at length learnt, in this
conference, with equal certainty, surprise, and pro∣vocation,
that the inheritance of Sir Hugh was posi∣tively
and entirely settled upon his youngest niece;
and that the denials of all expectation on the part of
Camilla, which she had always taken for closeness,
conveyed but the simple truth. Alarmed lest she should
incur the anger of Mr. Clykes, who was amongst her
most useful friends, she had written him word of the
discovery, with her concern at the mistake: and Mr.
Clykes, judging now he had no chance of the gratu∣ity
finally promised for <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>secresy,</HI> and even
that his principal was in danger, had sent an enraged
answer, with an imperious declaration, that he must
either immediately be repaid all he had laid out, or
receive some security for its being refunded, of higher
value than the note of a minor of no fortune nor ex∣pectations.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin protested she did not know which way
to turn, she was so sorry to have disobliged so good a
friend; and br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke forth into a vehement invective
against Mr. Dubster, for pretending he knew the truth
from young Squire Tyrold himself.</P>
<P>Long as was her lamentation, and satisfied as she
always felt to hear her own voice, her pause still came
too soon for any reply from Camilla, who now felt
the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovery of her situation to be inevitable, com∣pulsatory
and disgraceful. Self-upbraidings that she
had ever listened to such an expedient, assailed her
with the cruellest poignancy, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingling almost self-detestation
with utter despair.</P>
<P>In vain Mrs. Mittin pressed for some satisfaction;
she was mute from inability to devise any; till the
coachman of Mr. Lissin sent word he could wait no
longer. She then, in a broken voice, said, “Be so
good as to wait to Mr. Clykes, that if he will have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he patience to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few days, I will prepare my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ends to settle my accounts with him.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten then, recovering from her own fright
in this business, answered, “O, if that's the case, my
dear young lady, pray don't be unea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, for it grieves
me to vex you; and I promise you I'll coax my good
<PB N="199" REF="26"/>
friend to wait such a matter as that; for he's a vast
regard for me; he'll do any thing I ask him, I know.”</P>
<P>She now went away; and Lavinia, who ran to her
sister, found her in a state of distress, that melted her
gentle heart to behold: but when she gathered what
had passed, “This disclosure, my dearest Camilla,”
she cried, “can never be so tremendous as the inces∣sant
fear of its discovery. Think of that, I conjure
you! and endeavour to bear the one great shock, that
will lead to after peace and ease.”</P>
<P>“No, my dear sister, peace and ease are no more
for me!—My happiness was already buried;—and
now, all that remain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of consolation will be cut off
also, in the lost good opinion of my father and mo∣ther!
—that destroyed—and Edgar gone—whas is life
to me?—I barely exist!”</P>
<P>“And is it possible you can even a moment doubt
their forgiveness? dear as you are to them, cherished,
beloved!—”</P>
<P>“No—not their forgiveness—but their esteem—
their confidence, their pleasure in their daughter will
all end!—think, Lavinia, of my mother!—when she
finds I, too, have contributed to the distress and dis∣turbance
of my father—that on my account, too, his
small income is again straitened, his few gratifications
are again diminished—O Lavinia! how has she strove
to guard her poor tottering girl from evil! And how
has her fondness been always the pride of my life!
What a conclusion is this to her cares! what a reward
to all the goodness of my father!”</P>
<P>In this state of desperate wretchedness, she was still
incapable to make the avowal which was now become
indispensable, and which must require another loan
from the store her father held so sacred. Lavinia had
even less courage; and they determined to apply to
Eugenia, who, though as softly-feeling as either,
mingled in her character a sort of heroic philosophy,
that enabled her to execute and to endure the hardest
tasks, where she thought them the demand of virtue.
They resolved, therefore, the next morning, to send
<PB N="200" REF="27"/>
a note to Cleves for the carriage, and to commit the
affair to this inexperienced and youthful female sage.</P>
<P>Far from running, as she was wont, to meet her
father upon his entrance, Camilla was twice sent for
before she cou'ld gain strength to appear in his pre∣sence;
nor could his utmost kindness enable her to
look up.</P>
<P>The heart of Mr. Tyrold was penetrated by her
avoidance, and yet more sunk by her sight. His best
hopes were all defeated of affording her parental com∣fort,
and he was still to seek for her revival or sup∣port.</P>
<P>He related what had passed at Cleves, with the
accustomed openness with which he conversed with
his children as his friends. Clermont, he said, was
arrived, and had authenticated all the accounts, with
so little of either shame or sense, that a character less
determined upon indulgence than that of Sir Hugh,
must have revolted from affording him succour, if
merely to mortify him into repentance. The manner
of making payment, however, had been the difficult
discussion of the whole day. Sir Hugh was unequal
to performing any thing, though ready to consent to
every thing. When he proposed the sale of several
of his numerous horses, he objected, that what re∣mained
would be hard worked: when he mentioned
diminishing his table, he was afraid the poor would
take it ill, as they were used to have his orts: and
when he talked of discharging some of his servants,
he was sure they would think it very unkind. “His
heart,” continued Mr. Tyrold, “is so bountiful, and
so full of kindness, that he pleads his tender feelings,
and regretting wishes, against the sound reason of hard
necessity. What is right, however, must only in it∣self
seek what is pleasant; and there, when it ceases
to look more abroad, it is sure to find it.”</P>
<P>He stopt, hearing a deep sigh from Camilla, who
secretly ejaculated a prayer that this sentence might
live, henceforward, in her memory. He divined the
wish, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch devoutly he cchoed, and continued:</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="28"/>
“There is so little, in fine, that he could bear to
relinquish, that, with my utmost efforts, I could
not calculate any retrenchment, to which he will
agree, at more than an hundred a year. Yet his scru∣ples
concerning his vow resist all the en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaties of our
disinterested Eugenia, to either sell out for the sum,
or cut down any trees in Yorkshire. These difficul∣ties,
too potent for his weak frame, were again sink∣ing
him into that despondence which we should all
sedulously guard against, as the most prevailing of foes
to active virtue, when, to relieve him, I made a
proposal which my dear girls will both, I trust, find
peculiar pleasure in seconding.”</P>
<P>Camilla had already strove to raise her drooping
head, conscience struck at what was said of despond∣ence;
and now endeavoured to join in the chearful
confidence expressed by Lavinia, that he could not be
mistaken.</P>
<P>“The little hoard, into which already we have
broken for Lionel,” he went on, “I have offered to
lend him for present payment, as far as it will go,
and to receive it again at stated periods. In the mean
while, I shall accept from him the same interest as from
the bank. For this I am to have also security. I run no
risk of the little all I have to leave to my two girls.”</P>
<P>He now looked at them both, expecting to see plea∣sure
even in Camilla, that what was destined, hereaf∣ter,
for herself, could prove of the smallest utility to
Sir Hugh: but his disappointment, and her shock were
equal. Too true for the most transitory disguise, the
keenest anguish shot from her eye; and Mr. Tyrold,
amazed, said: “Is it Camilla who would draw back
from any service to her uncle?”</P>
<P>“Ah no!” cried she, with clasped hands, “I
would die to do him any good! and O!—that my
death at this momen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>”—</P>
<P>She stopt, affrighted, for Mr. Tyrold frowned. A
frown upon a face so constantly benign, was new, was
awful to her; but she instantly recollected his con∣demnation
of wishes so desperate, and fearfully taking
his hand, besought his forgiveness.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="29"/>
His brow instantly resumed its serenity. “I have
nothing,” said he, “my dearest child, to forgive,
from the moment you recollect yourself. But try,
for your own sake, to keep in mind, that the current
sorrows, however acute, of current life, are but use∣lessly
aggravated by vain wishes for death. The
smallest kind office better proves affection than any
words, however elevated.”</P>
<P>The conference here broke up; something incom∣prehensible
seemed to Mr Tyrold to be blended with
the grief of Camilla; and though from her birth she
had manifested, by every opportunity, the most libe∣ral
disregard of wealth, the something not understood
seemed always to have money for its object. What
this might be, he now fervently wished to explore;
yet still hoped, by patient kindness, to receive her
confidence voluntarily.</P>
<P>Camilla now was half dead; Lavinia could with
difficulty sustain, but by no possible means revive her.
What a period was this to disclose to her Father that
she must deprive him, in part, even of his promised
solace in his intended assistance to his brother, to sa∣tisfy
debts of which he suspected not the existence!</P>
<P>When forced down stairs, by a summons to supper,
Mr. Tyrold, to console her for his momentary dis∣pleasure,
redoubled his caresses; but his tenderness
only made her weep yet more bitterly, and he looked
at her with a heart rent with anguish. For Lavinia,
for Eugenia, he would have felt similar grief; but
their far less gay, though equally innocent natures,
would have made the view of their affliction less strik∣ingly
oppressive. Camilla had, hitherto, seemed in
the spring of joy yet more than of life. Anxiety
flew at her approach, and animation took its place.
Nothing could shake his resignation; yet to behold
her constant sadness, severely tried his fortitude. To
see tears trickling incessantly down the pale cheeks so
lately blooming; to see her youthful countenance
wear the haggard expression of care; to see life, in
its wish and purposes seem at an end, 'ere, in its
<PB N="203" REF="30"/>
ordinary calculation, it was reckoned to have begun,
drew him from every other consideration, and filled his
whole mind with monopolizing apprehension.</P>
<P>He now himself pressed her, for change of scene,
to accept an invitation she had received from Mrs.
Berlinton to Grosvenor Square, whither Indiana was
going in a few days, to spend a fortnight or three
weeks before her marriage. But she declined the ex∣cursion,
as not more unseasonable in its expence, than
ungenial to her feelings.</P>
<P>The following morning, while they were at their
melancholy breakfast, a letter arrived from Lisbon,
which Mr. Tyrold read with visible disturbance, ex∣claiming,
from time to time, “Lionel, thou art in∣deed
punished!”</P>
<P>The sisters were equally alarmed, but Lavinia alone
could make any inquiry.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold then informed them, their uncle Relvil
had just acknowledged to their Mother, that he could
no longer, in justice, conceal that, previously to his
quitting England, he had privately married his house∣keeper,
to induce her to accompany him in his voy∣age:
and that, during his first wrath upon the detec∣tion
of Lionel, he had dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iherited him in savour of
a little boy of her own, by a former marriage, whom
they had brought with them to Lisbon.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, though it had been his constant study
to bring up his children without any reference to
their rich uncles, had never internally doubted, but
that the bachelor brother of Mrs. Tyrold would leave
his fortune to the son of his only sister, who was his
sole near relation. And Lionel, he knew, in defiance
of his admonitions, had built upon it himself, rather
as a certainty than a hope. “He will now see,” said
Mr. Tyrold, “his presumption, and feel, by what he
suffers, what he has earned. Yet culpable as he has
been, he is now, also, unfortunate; and where crimes
are followed by punishment, it is not for mortal man
<PB N="204" REF="31"/>
to harbour unabating resentment. I will write a few
lines of comfort to him.”</P>
<P>Camilla, in this concession, experienced all she
could feel of satisfaction; but the short sensation died
away at the last words of the letter of her Mother,
which Mr. Tyrold read aloud.</P>
<P>“You, I well know, will immediately in this
evil, find for yourself, and impart to our children,
something of instruction, if not of comfort. Shall I
recollect this without emulation? No, I will bear up
from this stroke, which, at least, permits my return
to Etherington; where, in the bosom of my dear fa∣mily,
and supported by its honoured chief, I will for∣get
my voyage, my painful absence, and my disappoint∣ment,
in exertions of practical oeconomy, strict, but
not rigid, which our good children will vie with each
other to adopt: sedulous, all around, to shew in what
we can most forbear. I hope almost immediately to
claim my share in these labours, which such motives
will make light, and such companions render preci∣ous.”</P>
<P>In agony past repression at these words, Camilla
glided out of the room. The return of her Mother
was now horror to her, not joy; her shattered nerves
could not bear the interview, while under a cloud
threatening to burst in such a storm; and she entreat∣ed
Lavinia to tell her Father that she accepted his pro∣posal
for going to Mrs. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>linton's: “and there,”
she cried, “Lavinia, I will wait, till Eugenia has
told the dreadful history that thus humbles me to the
dust!”</P>
<P>Lavinia was too timid to oppose reason to this suf∣fering;
and Mr. Tyrold, already cruelly apprehensive
the obscurity of their recluse lives contributed to her
depression, and believing she compared her present pri∣vations
to the lost elegancies of Beech Park, sighed
heavily, yet said he was glad she would remove from
a spot in which reminiscence was so painful. This
was not, indeed, he added, the period he should have
selected for her visiting the capital, or residing at Mrs.
Berlinton's; but she was too much touched by the
<PB N="205" REF="32"/>
state of her family, not to be guarded in her expences;
and the pressure of her even augmenting sadness, was
heavier upon his mind than any other alar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>The conscience-struck Camilla could make no pro∣fession,
no promise; nor yet, though ardently wishing
it, refuse his offered advance of her next quarter's al∣lowance,
lest she should be reduced again to the neces∣sity
of borrowing.</P>
<P>This step once decided, brought with it something
like a gloomy composure▪ “I shall avoid,” she cried,
“at least, with my Mother, these killing caresses of
deluded kindness that break my heart with my Father.
She, too, would soon discover there was something
darker in my sadness than even grief! She would be
sure that even my exquisite loss could not render me
ungrateful to all condolement; she would know that
a daughter whom she had herself reared and instructed,
would blush so unceasingly to publish any personal dis∣appointment,
let her feel it how she might. O my
loved Mother! how did the delight of knowing your
kind expectations keep me, while under your guidance
in the way I ought to go! O Mother of my heart!
what a grievous disappointment awaits your sad return!
To find, at the first opening of your virtuous schemes
of general saving—that I, as well as Lionel, have in∣volved
my family in debts—that I, as well as Cler∣mont,
have committed them clandestinely to a usu∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r!”</P>
<P>Lavinia undertook to give Eugenia proper instructi∣ons
for her commission; but news arrived, the next
day, that Sir Hugh would take no denial to Eugenia's
being herself of the party. This added not, how∣ever,
to the courage of Camilla for staying, and her
next determination was to reveal the whole by letter.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would not send her to Cleves to take
leave, that her uncle might not be tempted to exer∣cise
his wonted, but now no longer convenient gene∣rosity,
nor yet be exposed to the pain of withholding
it. “You will go, now, my dear girl,” he said,
“in your p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istine simplicity, and what can so every
way become you? It is not for a scheme of pleasure,
<PB N="206" REF="33"/>
but for a stimulus to mental exertion, I part with you.
When you return, your excellent Mother will aid
your task, and reward its labour. Remember but,
while in your own hands, that open oeconomy, spring∣ing
from discretion, is always respected. It is false
shame alone that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egets ridicule.”</P>
<P>Weeping and silent she heard him, and his fears
gained ground that her disappointment, joined to a
view of gayer life, had robbed Etherington of all
charms to her. Bitterly he regretted he had ever suf∣fered
her to leave his roof, though he would not now
force her stay. Compulsion could only detain her
person; and might heighten the disgust of her mind.</P>
<P>The little time which remained was given wholly
to packing and preparing; and continued employment
hid from Mr. Tyrold her emotion, which encreased
every moment, till the carriage of Sir Hugh stopt at
the gate. Lost, then, to all sensation, but the horror
of the avowal that must intervene 'ere they met again,
with incertitude if again he would see her with the
same kindness, she flew into his arms, rather agonised
than affectionate; kissed his hands with fervor, kissed
every separate finger, rested upon his shoulder, hid
her face in his bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om, caught and pressed to her lips
even the slaps of his coat, and scarce restrained herself
from bending to kiss his feet; yet without uttering a
word, without even shedding a tear.</P>
<P>Strangely surprised, and deeply affected, Mr. Ty∣rold,
straining her to his breast, said: “Why, my
dear child, why, my dearest Camilla, if thus agitated
by our parting, do you leave me?”</P>
<P>This question brought her to recollection, by the
impossibility she found to answer it; she tore herself,
therefore, away from him, embraced Lavinia, and hur∣ried
into the coach.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Surprise.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA strove to check her grief upon enter∣ing
the carriage, in which Miss Margland had
again the charge of the young party; but the in∣terrogatory
of her Father, <HI>Why will you leave me?</HI>
was mentally repeated without ceasing. Ah! why,
indeed! thought she, at a moment when every filial
duty called more than ever for my stay!—Well
might he not divine the unnatural reason! can I
believe it myself?—Believe such an hour arrived?
—when my Mother—the best of Mothers!—is ex∣pected
—when she returns to her family, Camilla
seeks another abode! is not this a dream? and may
I not one day awake from it?</P>
<P>Miss Margland was in the highest good humour
at this expedition: and Indiana was still enraptured
to visit London, from old expectations which she
knew not how to relinquish; though they were
fixed to no point, and as fantastic as vague. Euge∣nia,
whose dejection had made Sir Hugh press her
into the party, found nothing in it to revive her;
and Camilla entered Grosvenor-square with keen
dissatisfaction of every sort. The cautions of Edgar
against Mrs Berlinton broke into all the little re∣lief
she might have experienced upon again seeing
her. She had meant to keep his final exhortations
constantly in her mind, and to make all his opini∣ons
and counsels the rule and measure of her con∣duct:
but a cruel perversity of events seemed to
cast her every action into an apparent defiance of
his wishes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who, in a mansion the most
splendid, received her with the same gentle sweet∣ness
she had first sought her regard, was de∣lighted
by the unexpected sight of Eugenia, whose
visit had been settled too late to be announced by
<PB N="208" REF="35"/>
letter; and caressed Indiana immediately as a sister.
Miss Margland, who came but for two days, sought
with much adulation to obtain an invitation for a
longer stay; but Mrs. Berlinton, though all cour∣tesy
and grace, incommoded herself with no society
that she did not find pleasing.</P>
<P>Melmond, who had accompanied them on horse∣back,
was eager to engage the kindness of his sister
for Indiana; and Mrs. Berlinton, in compliment to
her arrival, refused all parties for the evening, and
bestowed upon her an almost undivided attention.</P>
<P>This was not quite so pleasant to him in proof
as in hope. Passionless, in this case, herself, the
delusions of beauty deceived not her understand∣ing;
and half an hour sufficed to shew Indiana to be
frivolous, uncultivated, and unmeaning. The
perfection, nevertheless, of her face and person,
obviated either wonder or censure of the choice
of her brother; though she could not but regret
that he had not seen with mental eyes the truly
superior Eugenia.</P>
<P>The wretched Camilla quitted them all as soon
as possible, to retire to her chamber, and rumi∣nate
upon her purposed letter. She meant, at
first, to write in detail; but her difficulties accu∣mulated
as she weighed them. “What a season,”
cried she, “to sink Lionel still deeper in disgrace!
What a treachery, after voluntarily assisting him,
to complain of, and betray him! ah! let my own
faults teach me mercy for the faults of others!”
yet, without this acknowledgment, what exculpa∣tion
could she offer for the origin of her debts?
and all she had incurred at Tunbridge? those of
Southampton she now thought every way unpar∣donable.
Even were she to relate the vain hopes
which had led to the expence of the ball dress,
could she plead, to an understanding like that of
her Mother, that she had been deceived and played
upon by such a woman as Mrs. Mittin? “I am
astonished now myself,” she cried, “at that pas∣sive
facility!—but to me, alas, thought comes only
<PB N="209" REF="36"/>
with repentance!” The Higden debt, both for
the rent and the stores, was the only one at which
she did not blush, since, great as was her indiscre∣tion,
in not enquiring into her powers before she
plighted her services, it would be palliated by her
motive.</P>
<P>Vainly she took up her pen; not even a line
could she write. “How enervating,” she cried,
“is all wrong!” I have been, till now, a happy
stranger to fear! Partially favoured, and fondly
confiding, I have looked at my dear Father, I have
met my beloved Mother, with the same courage,
and the same pleasure that I looked at and met my
brother and my sisters, and only with more reve∣rence.
How miserable a change! I shudder now
at the presence of the most indulgent of Fathers!
I fly with guilty cowardice from the fondest of
Mothers!”</P>
<P>Eugenia, when able, followed her; and had no
sooner heard the whole history, than, tenderly
embracing her, she said, “Let not this distress
seem so desperate to you, my dearest sister! your
own account points out to me how to relieve it,
without either betraying our poor Lionel, or fur∣ther
weighing down our already heavily burthened
friends.”</P>
<P>“And how, my dear Eugenia?” cried Camilla,
with fearful gratitude, and involuntarily reviving
by the most distant idea of such a project.</P>
<P>By adopting, she said, the same means that had
been invented by Mrs. Mittin. She had many
valuable trinkets, the annual offerings of her mu∣nificent
uncle, the sale of which would go far
enough, she could not doubt, towards the payment
of the principal, to induce the money-lender to
accept interest for the rest, till the general affairs
of their house were re-established; when what re∣mained
of the sum could be discharged, without
difficulty, by herself; now no longer wanting mo∣ney,
nor capable of receiving any pleasure from it,
but by the pleasure she might give.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="37"/>
Camilla pressed her in her arms, almost kneeling
with fond acknowledgements, and accepted, with∣out
hesitation, her generous offer.</P>
<P>“All then, is arranged,” said Eugenia, with a
smile so benign, it seemed nearly beautiful; “and
to friendship, and each other, we will devote our
future days. My spirits will revive in the revival
of Camilla. To see her again gay will be reno∣vation
to my uncle; and who knows, my dear
sister, but our whole family may again be blest,
'ere long, with peace?”</P>
<P>The next morning they sent off a note to the
money-lender, whose direction Camilla had re∣ceived
from Mrs. Mittin, entreating his patience
for a fortnight, or three weeks, when he would
receive the greatest part of his money, with every
species of acknowledgement.</P>
<P>Camilla, much relieved, went to sit with Mrs.
Berlinton, but on entering the dressing room, was
struck by the sight of Bellamy, just quitting it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, upon her appearance, with a
look of soft rapture approaching her, said: “Feli∣citate
me, loveliest Camilla!—my friend, my
chosen friend is restored to me, and the society for
which so long I have sighed in vain, may be once
more mine!”</P>
<P>Camilla, startled, exclaimed with earnestness,
“My dearest Mrs. Berlinton, pardon me, I entreat
—but is Mr. Bellamy known to Mr. Berlinton?”</P>
<P>“No!” answered she, disdainfully; “but he
has been seen by him. Mr. Berlinton is a stranger
to merit or taste; and Alphonso, to him, is but as
any other man”</P>
<P>“They are, however, acquainted with each
other?” said Camilla.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton answered, that, after her marri∣age,
she remained three months in Wales with her
aunt, where Bellamy was travelling to view the
country, and where, almost immediately after that
<PB N="211" REF="38"/>
unhappy enthralment, she first knew him, and first
learnt the soothing charms of friendship; but from
that period they had met no more, though they
constantly corresponded.</P>
<P>Camilla was now first sensible of all the alarm
with which Edgar had hitherto strove to impress
her in vain. The impropriety of such a connexi∣on,
the danger of such a partiality, filled her with
wonder and disturbance. She hesitated whether to
relate or not the adventure of Bellamy with her
sister; but the strong repugnance of Eugenia to
having it named, and the impossibility of proving
the truth of the general opinion of his base scheme,
decided her to silence. Upon the plans and the
sentiments, however, of Mrs. Berlinton herself,
she spared not the extremest sincerity: but she
gained no ground by the contest, though she lost
not any kindness by the attempt.</P>
<P>At dinner, she felt extremely disturbed by the re∣appearance
of Bellamy, who alone, she found, had
been excepted by Mrs. Berlinton, in the orders of
general denial to company. He seemed, himself,
much struck at the sight of Eugenia, who blushed
and looked embarrassed by his presence. He did
not, however, address her; he confined his attenti∣ons
to Mrs. Berlinton, or Miss Margland.</P>
<P>The former received them with distinguishing
softness; the latter, at first, disdainfully repelled
them, from the general belief at Cleves of his at∣tempted
elopement with Eugenia; but afterwards,
finding she was left wholly to a person who had no
resources for entertaining her, namely, herself,—
and knowing Eugenia safe while immediately under
her eye, she deigned to treat him with more con∣sideration.</P>
<P>The opera was proposed for the evening, Mrs.
Berlinton, having both tickets and her box at the
service of her fair friends, as the lady with whom
whom she had subscribed was out of town. Indi∣ana
was enchanted, Miss Margland was elevated,
and Eugenia not unwilling to seek some recreation,
<PB N="212" REF="39"/>
though hopeless of finding it. But Camilla, not∣withstanding
she was lightened, at this moment,
from one of her most corrosive cares, was too en∣tirely
miserable for any species of amusement. The
same strong feelings that gave to pleasure, when
she was happy, so high a zest, rendered it nearly
abhorrent to her, when grief had possession of her
mind.</P>
<P>After dinner, when the ladies retired to dress,
Camilla, with some uneasiness, conjured Eugenia to
avoid renewing any acquaintance with Bellamy.</P>
<P>Eugenia blushing, while a tear started into either
eye, said she was but too well guarded from Bella∣my,
through a late transaction; which had exalted
her to a summit of happiness, from which she could
never now descend to any new plan of life, beyond
the single state and retirement.</P>
<P>At night, the whole party went to the Opera,
except Camilla, who, in spending the evening
alone, meant to ruminate upon her affairs, and ar∣range
her future conduct: but Edgar, his virtues,
and his loss, took imperious possession of all her
thoughts; and while she dwelt upon his honour,
his sincerity, and his goodness, and traced, with
cherished recollection, every scene in which she
had been engaged with him, he and they recurred
to her as visions of all earthly felicity.</P>
<P>Awakened from these reveries, by the sound of
the carriage, and the rapping at the street door,
she was hastening down stairs to meet her sister,
when she heard Melmond call out from the coach:
“Is Miss Eugenia Tyrold come home?”</P>
<P>“No;” the man answered; and Melmond ex∣claimed;
“Good Heaven!—I must run then back
to the theatre. Do not be alarmed, my Indiana,
and do not alarm Miss Camilla, for I will not re∣turn
without her.”</P>
<P>They all entered but himself; while Camilla,
fixed to the stair upon which she had heard these
<PB N="213" REF="40"/>
words, remained some minutes motionless. Then,
tottering down to the parlour, with a voice hollow
from affright, and a face pale as death, she tremu∣lously
articulated, “where is my sister?”</P>
<P>They looked all aghast, and not one of them,
for some time, was capable to give any account
that was intelligible. She then gathered that, in
coming out of the theatre, to get to the coach,
they had missed her. None of them knew how,
which way, in what manner.</P>
<P>“And where's Mr. Bellamy?” cried she, in an
agony of apprehension; “was he at the Opera?
where—where is he?”</P>
<P>Miss Margland looked dismayed, and Mrs. Ber∣linton
amazed, at this interrogatory; but they
both said he had only been in the box at the be∣ginning
of the Opera, and afterwards to help them
out of the crowd.</P>
<P>“And who did he help? who? who?” exclaimed
Camilla.</P>
<P>“Me,—first—” answered Miss Margland,—”
and, when we got into a great crowd, he took care
of Miss Eugenia too.” She then added, that in this
crowd, both she and Eugenia had been separated
from Mrs. Berlinton and Indiana, who by Mel∣mond
and another gentleman had been handed
straight to the carriage, without difficulty; that
soon after, she had lost the arm of Bellamy, who,
by some mistake, had turned a wrong way; but she
got to the coach by herself; where they had wait∣ed
full half an hour, Melmond running to and fro
and searching in every direction, but in vain, to
find Eugenia. Nor had Bellamy again appeared.
They then came home, hoping he had put her into
a chair, and that she might be arrived before them.</P>
<P>“Dreadful! dreadful!” cried Camilla, sinking
on the floor, “she is forced away! she is lost!”</P>
<P>When again her strength returned, she desired
that some one might go immediately to the house
or lodgings of Bellamy, to enquire if he were come
home.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="41"/>
This was done by a footman, who brought word
he had not been seen there since six o'clock in the
evening, when he dressed, and went out.</P>
<P>Camilla now, confirmed in her horrible surmise,
was nearly frantic. She bewailed her sister, her
father, her uncle; she wanted herself to rush
forth, to search Eugenia in the streets; she could
scarce be detained within, scarce kept off from en∣tire
delirium.</P>

<P>IT was four o'clock in the morning when Mel∣mond
returned. Camilla rushed to the street door
to meet him. His silence and his mournful air an∣nounced
his ill success. She wrung her hands in
anguish, and besought him to send instantly an ex∣press
to Etherington, with the fatal tidings.</P>
<P>He went himself to the nearest stables, desiring
she would prepare a letter while he got a man and
horse for the journey.</P>
<P>In scrawling and indistinct characters she then
wrote:</P>
<P>“O my Father—our Eugenia has disappeared!
she was lost last night at the Opera—Mr. Bellamy
was conducting her to Mrs. Berlinton's coach—
but we have seen neither of them since!—what—
what must we do?”</P>
<P>Melmond wrote the address, which her hand
could not make legible; and Miss Margland pre∣pared
for the post a laboured vindication to Sir
Hugh of her own conduct upon this occasion.</P>
<P>Indiana was long gone to bed. She was really
very sorry; but she was really much tired; and she
could do, as she said, no good.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Berlinton felt an alarm for Eugenia,
and an astonishment concerning Bellamy, that
<PB N="215" REF="42"/>
would fully have wakened her faculties, had she
been wholly unmoved by the misery of Camilla.
Far other was, however, her nature, gentle, com∣passionate,
and sympathising; and her own internal
disturbance, though great even beyond her own
conception why, sunk at sight of the excess of
wretchedness which disordered her poor friend.</P>
<P>There could be but one possible opinion of this
disastrous adventure, which was, that Bellamy had
spirited this young creature away, to secure her
fortune, by her hand. Melmond again went forth,
to make enquiry at all the stables in London, for
any carriage that might have been hired for a late
hour. And at six o'clock, in great perturbation,
he came back, saying, he had just traced that she
was put into a chaise and four from a hackney
coach; that the chaise was hired in Piccadilly, and
engaged for a week. He was now determined to
ride post himself in the pursuit, that, if any acci∣dental
delay retarded them, he might recover her
before she arrived at Gretna Green, whither he
could not doubt she was to be conveyed: but as she
could not be married by force, his presence might
yet be in time to prevent persecution, or foul play.</P>
<P>Camilla nearly embraced him with transport at
this ray of hope, and, leaving his tenderest con∣dolements
for Indiana, whom he implored his sister
to watch sedulously, he galloped northwards.</P>
<P>His heart was most sincerely in the business;
what he owed to the noble conduct which the high
sentiments and pure regard of Eugenia had dictat∣ed,
had excited a tender veneration, which made
him hold his life as too small an offering to be re∣fused
for her service, if its sacrifice could essenti∣ally
shew his gratitude. And often his secret mind
had breathed a wish, that her love of literature had
been instilled into her cousin; though he studiously
checked, as profane, all that was not admiration of
that most exquisite workmanship of nature.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton wanted not to be told this pro∣ceeding
was wrong, yet still found it impossible to
<PB N="216" REF="43"/>
persuade herself Eugenia would not soon think it
right; though Eugenia was the creature that she
most revered in the whole world, and though, with
Bellamy himself she felt irritated and disappointed.</P>
<P>Camilla in every evil reverted to the loss of
Edgar, whose guardian care, had she preserved
him, would have preserved, she thought, her loved
Eugenia.</P>
<P>The express from Etherington brought back
only a few lines written by Lavinia, with an ac∣count
that Mr. Tyrold, in deep misery, was setting
out post for Scotland.</P>
<P>A week passed thus in suspense, nearly intolera∣ble
to Camilla, before Melmond returned.</P>
<P>Always upon the watch, she heard his voice, and
flew to meet him in the dressing room. He was
at the feet of Indiana, to whom he was pouring
forth his ardent lamentations at this long depriva∣tion
of her sight.</P>
<P>But joy had evidently no part in his tenderness;
Camilla saw at once depression and evil tidings,
and, sinking upon a chair, could scarcely pro∣nounce,
“Have you not then found her?”</P>
<P>“I have left her but this minute,” he answered,
in a tone the most melancholy.</P>
<P>“Ah! you have then seen her! you have seen
my dearest Eugenia?—O, Mr. Melmond, why have
you left her at all?”</P>
<P>It was long before he could answer; he besought
her to compose herself; he expressed the extremest
solicitude for the uneasiness of Indiana, whose eter∣nal
interruptions of “Dear! where is she?—
Dear! why did not she come back?—Dear! who
took her away?” he attributed to the agitation of
the fondest friendship, and conjured, while tears of
terror started into his eyes, that she would mode∣rate
the excess of her sensibility. It seems the pe∣culiar
province of the lover to transfuse all that he
himself most prizes, and thinks praise-worthy,
into the breast of his chosen object; nor is he more
blind to the defects with which she may abound,
<PB N="217" REF="44"/>
than prodigal in gifts of virtues which exist but in
his own admiration.</P>
<P>“And my Father? my poor Father!” cried
Camilla, “you have seen nothing of my Father?”</P>
<P>“Pardon me; I have just left him also.”</P>
<P>“And not with Eugenia?”</P>
<P>“Yes; they are together.”</P>
<P>Rapture now defied all apprehension with Ca∣milla;
the idea of Eugenia restored to her Father,
was an idea of entire happiness; but her joy affect∣ed
Melmond yet more than her alarm: he could
not let her fasten upon any false expectations; he
bid his sister aid him to support Indiana, and then,
with all the gentleness of the sincerest concern,
confessed that Eugenia was married before she was
overtaken.</P>
<P>This was a blow for which Camilla was still un∣prepared.
She concluded it a forced marriage;
horror froze her veins, her blood no longer flow∣ed,
her heart ceased to beat, she fell lifeless on the
ground.</P>
<P>Her recovery was more speedy that it was hap∣py,
and she was assisted to her chamber, no longer
asking any questions, no longer desiring further
information. All was over of hope: and the par∣ticulars
seemed immaterial, since the catastrophe
was as irreversible as it was afflicting.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton still attended her, grieved for her
suffering, yet believing that Eugenia would be the
happiest of women; though an indignation the
most forcible mingled with her surprise at the con∣duct
of Bellamy.</P>
<P>This dread sort of chasm in the acuteness of
the feelings of Camilla lasted not long; and Mrs.
Berlinton then brought from Melmond the fol∣lowing
account.</P>
<P>With the utmost speed he could use, he could
not, though a single horse-man, overtake them.
They never, as he learnt by the way, remitted
their journey, nor stopt for the smallest refresh∣ment
but at some cottage. At length, in the last
<PB N="218" REF="45"/>
stage to Gretna Green, he met them upon their
return. It was easy to him to see that his errand
was vain, and the knot indissolubly tied, by the
blinds being down, and the easy air with which
Bellamy was looking around him.</P>
<P>Eugenia sat back in the chaise with a handker∣chief
to her eyes. He stopt the vehicle, and told
Bellamy he must speak with that lady. “That
lady, Sir,” he produly answered, “is my wife;
speak to her, therefore;—but in my hearing.”
Eugenia at this dropt her handkerchief, and looked
up. Her eyes were sunk into her head by weep∣ing,
and her face was a living picture of grief.
Melmond loudly exclaimed: “I come by the au∣thority
of her friends, and I demand her own ac∣count
of this transaction.” “We are now going
to our friends,” replied he, “ourselves, and we
shall send them no messages.” He then ordered
the postillion to drive on, telling him at his peril
to stop no more; Eugenia, in a tone but just audi∣ble,
saying: “Adieu, Mr. Melmond! Adieu!”</P>
<P>To have risked his life in her rescue, at such a
moment, seemed to him nothing, could he but
more certainly have ascertained her own wishes,
and real situation: but as she attempted neither re∣sistance
nor remonstrance, he concluded Bellamy
spoke truth; and if they were married, he could
not unmarry them; and if they were going to her
friends, they were doing all he could now exact.
He resolved, however, to follow, and if they should
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn any other road, to call for assistance till he
could investigate the truth.</P>
<P>They stopped occasionally for refreshments at
the usual inns, and travelled no more in the dark;
but Bellamy never lost sight of her; and Melmond,
in watching, observed that she returned to the
chaise with as little opposition as she quitted it,
though weeping always, and never, for a voluntary
moment, uncovering her face. Bellamy seemed
always most assiduous in his attentions: she never
<PB N="219" REF="46"/>
appeared to repulse him, nor to receive from him any
comfort.</P>
<P>On the second day's journey, just as Bellamy hand∣ed
her from the chaise, at the inn where they meant to
dine, and which Melmond, as usual, entered at the
same time, he saw Mr. Tyrold—hurrying, but so
shaking he could scarcely support himself, from a par∣lour,
whence he had seen them alight, into the pas∣sage.
The eyes, ever downcast, of Eugenia, per∣ceived
him not, till she was clasped, in mute agony,
in his arms. She then looked up, saw who it was,
and fainted away. Bellamy, though he knew him
not, supposed who he might be, and his reverend ap∣pearance
seemed to impress him with awe. Never∣theless,
be was himself seizing the now senseless
Eugenia, to convey her to some room; when Mr.
Tyrold, reviving from indignation, fixed his eyes upon
his face, and said: “By what authority, Sir, do
you presume to take charge of my daughter?”—“By
the authority,” he answered, “of a husband.” Mr.
Tyrold said no more; he caught by the arm of Mel∣mond,
though he had not yet seen who he was, and
Bellamy carried Eugenia into the first vacant parlour,
followed only by the woman of the house.</P>
<P>Melmond then, respectfully, and filled with the
deepest commiseration, sought to make himself known
to Mr. Tyrold; but he heard him not, he heeded no
one; he sat down upon a trunk, accidentally, in the
passage where all this had passed, saying, but almost
without seeming conscious that he spoke aloud:
“This, indeed, is a blow to break both our hearts!”
Melmond then stood silently by, for he saw, by his
folded hands and uplifted eyes, he was ejaculating
some prayer: after which, with a countenance more
firm, and limbs better able to sustain him, he rose,
and moved towards the parlour into which the fainting
Eugenia had been carried.</P>
<P>Melmond then again spoke to him by his name.
He recollected the voice, turned to him, and gave
him his hand, which was of an icy coldness. “You
are very kind, Mr. Melmond,” he said; “my poor
<PB N="220" REF="47"/>
girl”—but stopt, checking what he meant to add,
and went to the parlour-door.</P>
<P>It was locked. The woman of the house had
left it, and said, the lady was recovered from her
fit. Mr. Tyrold, from a thousand feelings, seem∣ed
unable to demand admission for himself: he de∣sired
Melmond to speak, and claim an audience
alone for him with his daughter.</P>
<P>Bellamy opened the door with a look evidently
humbled and frightened, yet affecting perfect ease.
When Melmond made known his commission,
Eugenia, starting up, exclaimed: “Yes, yes! I
will see my dear Father alone!—and O! that this
poor frame might sink to rest on his loved bosom!”</P>
<P>“In a moment! in a moment!” cried Bellamy,
motioning Melmond to withdraw; tell Mr. Ty∣rold
he shall come in a moment.”</P>
<P>Melmond was forced to retreat; but heard him
hastily say, as again he fastened the door, “My
life, O Eugenia! is in your hands—and is it thus
you requite my ardent love and constancy?”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would now wait but a few minutes:
it was palpable Bellamy feared the interview; and
he could fear it but from one motive: he sent
him, therefore, word by Melmond, that if he
did not immediately retire, and leave him to a
conference alone with his daughter, he would
apply no more for a meeting till he claimed it in a
court of justice.</P>
<P>Bellamy soon came out, bowed obsequiously to
Mr. Tyrold, who passed him without notice, and
who was then for half an hour shut up with Eu∣genia.
Longer Bellamy could not endure; he
broke in upon them, and left the room no more.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mr. Tyrold came out, his own eyes
now as red as those of the weeping bride. He
took Melmond apart, thanked him for his kind∣ness,
but said nothing could be done. He entreat∣ed
him therefore to return to his own happier af∣fairs;
adding, “I cannot talk upon this miserable
event. Tell Camilla, her sister is, for the present,
<PB N="221" REF="48"/>
going home with me—though not, alas! alone!
Tell her, too, I will write to her upon my arrival
at Etherington.”</P>
<P>“This,” concluded Mrs. Berlinton, “is all my
brother has to relate; all that for himself he adds▪
is, that if ever, to something human, the mind of
an angel was accorded—that mind seems enshrined
in the heart of Eugenia!”</P>
<P>Nothing that Camilla had yet experienced o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
unhappiness, had penetrated her with feelings of
such deadly woe as this event. Eugenia, from her
childhood, had seemed marked by calamity: her
ill health, even from infancy, and her subsequent
misfortunes, had excited in her whole house the
tenderest pity, to which the uncommon character
with which she grew up, had added respect and
admiration. And the strange, and almost continu∣al
trials she had to encounter, from the period of
her attaining her fifteenth year, which, far from
souring her mind, had seemed to render it more
perfect, had now nearly sanctified her in the estima∣tion
of them all. To see her, therefore, fall, at
last, a sacrifice to deceit or violence,—for one, if
not both, had palpably put her into the possession
of Bellamy, was a grief more piercingly wounding
than all she had yet suffered. Whatever she had
personally to bear, she constantly imagined some
imprudence or impropriety had provoked; but
Eugenia, while she appeared to her so blameless,
that she could merit no evil, was so amiable, that
willingly she would have borne for her their united
portions.</P>
<P>How it had been effected, since force would be
illegal, still kept amazement joined to sorrow, till
the promised letter arrived from Mr. Tyrold, with
an account of the transaction.</P>
<P>Eugenia, parted from Miss Margland by Bellamy,
in the crowd, was obliged to accept his his pro∣tection,
which, till then, she had refused, to restore
her to her company. The coach, he said, he
knew, had orders to wait in Pall Mall, whither
<PB N="222" REF="49"/>
the other ladies would be conveyed in chairs, to
avoid danger from the surrounding carriages. She
desired to go, also, in a chair; but he hurried her
by quick surprize into a hackney-coach, which, he
said, would be more speedy, and bidding the man
drive to Pall Mall seated himself opposite to her.
She had not the most remote suspicion of his design,
as his behaviour was even coldly distant, though
she wondered Pall Mall was so far off, and that
the coachman drove so fast, till they stopt at a
turnpike—and then, in one quick and decided
moment, she comprehended her situation, and
made an attempt for her own deliverance—but he
prevented her from being heard.—And the scenes
that followed she declined relating. Yet, what
she would not recount, she could not, to the ques∣tions
of her Father, deny, that force, from that
moment, was used, to repel all her efforts for ob∣taining
help, and to remove her into a chaise.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold required to hear nothing more, to
establish a prosecution, and to seize her, publickly,
from Bellamy. But from this she recoiled. “No,
my dear Father,” she continued, “the die is cast!
and I am his!—Solemn has been my vow! sacred
I must hold it!”</P>
<P>She then briefly narrated, that though violence
was used to silence her at every place where she
sought to be rescued, every interval was employed,
by Bellamy, in the humblest supplications for her
pardon, and most passionate protestations of re∣gard,
all beginning and all ending in declaring,
that to live longer without her was impossi ble,
and pledging his ardent attachment for obtaining
her future favour; spending the period from stage
to stage, or turnpike to urnpike, in kneeling to
beseech forgiveness for the desperation to which
he was driven, by the most cruel and hopeless
passion that ever seized the heart of man. When
they were near their journey's end, he owned that
his life was in her hands, but he was indifferent
whether he lost it from the misery of living with∣out
<PB N="223" REF="50"/>
her, or from her vengeance of this last strug∣gle
of his despair. She assured him his life was
safe, and offered him pardon upon condition of
immediate restoration to her friends; but, sudden∣ly
producing a pistol, “Now then,” he said, “O!
amiable object of my constant love! bless me with
your hand, or prepare to see me die at your feet!”
And, with a terrifying oath, he bound himself not
to lose her and outlive her loss. She besought him
to be more reasonable, with the gentlest prayers;
but his vehemence only encreased; she offered
him every other promise he could name; but he
preferred death to every other she should grant.
She then pronounced, though in trembling, a posi∣tive
refusal. Instantly he lifted up his pistol, and
calling out: “Forgive, then, O hard-hearted
Eugenia, my uncontroulable passion, and shed a
tear over the corpse I am going to prostrate at your
feet!” was pointing it to his temple, when over∣come
with horror, she caught his arm, exclaim∣ing;
“Ah! stop! I consent to what you please!”
It was in vain she strove afterwards to retract;
one scene followed another, till he had bound her
by all she herself held sacred, to rescue him from
suicide, by consenting to the union. He found a
person who performed the marriage ceremony on
the minute of her quitting the chaise. She utter∣ed
not one word; she was passive, scared, and
scarce alive; but resisted not the eventful ring,
with which he encircled her finger, and seemed
rousing as from a dream▪ upon hearing him call
her his wife. He professed eternal gratitude, and
eternal devotion; but no sooner was all conflict
at an end, than, consigning herself wholly to grief,
she wept without intermission.</P>
<P>When Mr. Tyrold had heard her history, abhor∣rence
of such barbarous force, and detestation of
such foul play upon the ingenuous credulity of
her nature, made him insist, yet more strongly,
upon taking legal measures for procuring an im∣mediate
separation and subsequent punishment; but
<PB N="224" REF="51"/>
the reiterated vows with which, since the ceremo∣ny,
he had bound her to himself, so forcibly awed
the strict conscientiousness of her principles,
that no representations could absolve her opinion
of what she now held her duty; and while she
confessed her unhappiness at a connexion formed
by such cruel means, she conjured him not to en∣crease
it, by rendering her, in her own estimati∣on,
perjured.</P>
<P>“Patiently, therefore,” continued Mr. Tyrold,
“we must bear, what vainly we should combat,
and bow down to those calamities of which the
purpose is hidden, nor fancy no good is answered,
because none is obvious. Man develops but little,
though he experiences much. The time will come
for his greater diffusion of knowledge; let him
meet it without dread, by using worthily his actual
portion. I resign myself, therefore, with reve∣rence
to this blow; though none yet has struck
so hardly at my heart. We must now do what we
can for this victim to her own purity, by seeking
means to secure her future independence, and by
bettering—if possible!—her betrayer. What a
daughter, what a sister, what a friend, has her fa∣mily
thus lost! How will your poor Mother re∣ceive
such killing tidings! Misfortune, sickness,
and poverty, she has heroism to endure; but in∣nocence
oppressed through its own artlessness, and
inexperience duped by villainy, will shake her ut∣most
firmness, and harass into disorder her, as yet,
unbroken powers of encountering adversity. Alas!
—no evils that visited the early years of this loved
child, have proved to her so grievous as the large
fortune with which they were followed! We re∣pined,
my Camilla, at the deprivation you sustain∣ed
at that period.—We owe to it, perhaps, that
you have not as treacherously been betrayed!</P>
<P>“How has the opening promise of our Eugenia
more than answered our fondest expectations!
Her knowledge is still less is uncommon than her
simplicity, her philosophy for herself than her
<PB N="225" REF="52"/>
zeal in the service of others. She is singular with
sweetness, peculiar, yet not impracticable; gene∣rous
without parade, and wise without conscious∣ness.
Yet now, so sacrificed seems all.—that I
dwell upon her excellencies as if enumerating
them over her tomb!”</P>
<P>A letter from Lavinia contained some further
particulars. Their Father, she said, finding the
poor victim resolute, meant to spare Sir Hugh all
that was possible of the detestable craft of Bellamy;
and Eugenia was already struggling to recover her
natural serenity, that she might appear before him
without endangering his own. Bellamy talked of
nothing but love and rapture; yet the unsuspicious
Eugenia was the only person he deceived; for so
little from the heart seemed either his looks or his
expressions, that it was palpable he was acting a
part, to all who believed it possible words and
thoughts could be divided.</P>
<P>A postscript to this letter was added by Eugenia
herself.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“Ah, my Camilla!—where now are all our
sweet promised participations?—But let me not
talk of myself; nor do you, my affectionate sister,
dwell upon me at this period. One thing I under∣took
shall yet be performed; the moment I am
able to go to Cleves, I will deliver, through
Lavinia, what I mentioned. Does any thing else
remain that is yet in my power? Tell me, my
Camilla, and think but with what joy you will
give joy again to your</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>EUGENIA.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Broken hearted over these letters, Camilla spent
her time in their perpetual perusal, in wiping from
them her tears, and pressing with fond anguish to
her lips the signature of her hapless sister, self-beguiled
by her own credulous goodness, and self-devoted
by her conscientious scruples.</P>

<P>MR. Clykes, by the promised payment and re∣ward,
being for the present appeased, Camilla still
admitted some hope of waiting a more favourable
moment for her cruel confession. She received,
also, a little though mournful, reprieve from ter∣ror,
by a letter from Lisbon, written to again
postpone the return of Mrs. Tyrold, at the earnest
request of Mr. Relvil; and she flattered herself
that, before her arrival, she should be enabled to
resume those only duties which could draw her
from despondence. She lived, meanwhile, wholly
shut up from all company, consigned to penitence
for her indiscretions, to grief for the fate of her
sister, and to wasting regret of her own causelessly
lost felicity.</P>
<P>Indiana smiled not more sweetly upon Mel∣mond,
for Miss Margland's advising her to con∣sider
in time, whether the promises made by Miss
Eugenia Tyrold, would be binding to Mrs. Bel∣lamy.
She saw, nevertheless, no good, she said, it
could do her cousin, that she should neglect such
an opportunity of seeing London: and Miss
Margland, in aid of this desire, spared so much
trouble to Mrs. Berlinton, who soon wearied of
Indiana, that she had the satisfaction of being in∣vited
to remain in Grosvenor-square till the two
young ladies returned into the country.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who indulged, in full ex∣tent,
every feeling, but investigated none, had
been piqued and hurt to extreme unhappiness at the
late conduct of Bellamy. Attracted by his fine
person, and caught by the first flattery which had
talked to her of her own, she had easily been cap∣tivated
by his description of the sympathy which
united, and penetrated by his lamentations at the
<PB N="227" REF="54"/>
destiny which parted them. His request for her
friendship had been the first circumstance, after
her marriage, which had given her any interest in
life; and soon, with the common effect of such
dangerous expedients to while away chagrin, had
occupied all her thoughts, and made the rest of
the universe seem to her as a blank. But their
continued separation from each other, made the
day soon too long for mere regret; and her pliant
mind, in this state of vacancy, had readily been
bent to the new pursuit pressed upon her by Mrs.
Norfield; which, however, upon the re-appear∣ance
of Bellamy, would speedily have given way
to the resumption of his influence, had not his
elopement with Eugenia left her again all at large.
It destroyed an illusion strong though not defina∣ble;
demolished a friendship ill conceived, and
worse understood; and brought with it a disap∣pointment
which confused all her ideas. To be
inactive was, however, impossible; simplicity,
once given up, returns to the dissipated no more
or returns but when experience brings conviction,
That all is hollow where the heart bears no part;
all is peril where principle is not the guide.</P>
<P>The Faro Table was now re-opened, and again
but too powerfully sharpened the faculties which
mortification had blunted. A company the most
miscellaneous composed her evening assemblies,
which were soon, nevertheless, amongst the most
fashionable, as well as crowded of the metropolis.
Whatever there, is new and splendid, is sure of a
run for at least a season. Enquiries into what is
right, or strictures upon what is wrong, rarely
molest popularity, till the rise of some fresher lu∣minary
gives fashion another abode.</P>
<P>Calamity requires not more fortitude than plea∣sure.
What she began but to divert disappoint∣ment
and lassitude, she continued to attain cele∣brity;
and the company which Faro and Fashion
brought together, she soon grew ambitious to
collect by motives of more appropriate flattery.
<PB N="228" REF="55"/>
All her aim, now, was to be universally alluring;
and she looked from object to object, in smiling
discourse, till one by one, every object could look
only at her: and the grace and softness which had
been secretly bewitching while she had the dignity
to keep admiration aloof, were boldly declared to
be invincible, since she permitted such professions
to reach her ear.</P>
<P>Long surrounded by gazing admirers, she be∣came
now encircled by avowed adorers; and what
for victory she had essayed, she pursued ardently
for pleasure. Coquetry is as fascinating to those
who practise it, as to those whom it seduces; and
she found herself, shortly more happy by a con∣quest
effected by wiles and by art, than by any
devotion paid straight forward, and uncourted.
The generality of her new ambition protected it
from permanent ill consequences; aiming at every
one, she cared for no one; mortified by Bellamy,
she resolved to mortify others, and in proportion
as her smiles grew softer her heart became harder.</P>
<P>Indiana, at this period, immersed at once from
the most private retreat into the gayest vortex of
pleasure, thought herself in the upper regions,
where happiness, composed by her own ideas, con∣sisted
in perpetual admiration of unfading beauty:
but though the high qualities with which the de∣votion
of Melmond had gifted her, had enslaved
his reason and understanding from suspecting that
so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air a form could enclose aught short of its own
perfection, his heart was struck and all his feelings
were offended, when he saw her capable of dissipa∣tion
upon a season of calamity to Eugenia: Euge∣nia,
whom though he could not love, he venerated;
Eugenia, whose nature he thought divine, though
her person, unhappily, was but too human; Eu∣genia,
to whom he owed the union upon which
hung all his wishes … to seek pleasure while
Eugenia suffered, was astonishing, was incompre∣hensible.
He felt as if every principle of his love
were violated; he looked another way, to disguise
<PB N="229" REF="56"/>
his shock;—but when he looked at her again, it
was forgotten.</P>
<P>Camilla soon after learnt, from Lavinia, that
Sir Hugh had been deeply affected by the history
of the elopement, though it had been softened to
him by all possible means, at the desire of the
heroic Eugenia herself; who would now own to
no one the force with which she had been carried
off. Bellamy continued the most unremitting de∣monstrations
of affection, which she received with
gentleness, and appeared entirely to credit as
sincere; but he had already absolutely refused a
residence offered for them both at Cleves, and
made Eugenia herself ask a separate provision of
her uncle, though she could not even a moment
pretend that the desire was her own. Sir Hugh,
nevertheless, had yielded; and notwithstanding
his present embarrassments from Clermont, had
insisted upon settling a thousand pounds a year
upon her immediately; in consequence of which,
Bellamy had instantly taken a house at Belfont, to
which they were already removing. Eugenia had
recovered her gentle fortitude, seemed to submit
to her destiny, and repined solely she could not,
yet, keep her engagement with respect to the
trinkets, which though she had openly told Bella∣my
were promised to a friend, he had seized to
pack up, and said, “he could not re-deliver till
they were arranged in their new dwelling.” But
she charged Lavinia to express her hopes that the
detention would not last long.</P>
<P>When the given three weeks expired, Indiana,
infatuated with London, begged and obtained leave
to stretch her residence there to a month.</P>
<P>Eugenia was now settled at Belfont; but still
Camilla received no intelligence of the promised
boon, and spent her lingering hours in her cham∣ber,
<PB N="230" REF="57"/>
no longer even invited thence, except at
meals, by Mrs. Berlinton; whose extreme and en∣creasing
dissipation, from first allowing no time,
took off, next, all desire for social life. Surprised
and hurt, Camilla was called off a little from her∣self,
through concern. She sincerely loved Mrs.
Berlinton, whom it was difficult to see and know
with indifference, and she softly represented to her
how ill she felt at ease in the falling off she expe∣rienced
in her partiality.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton tenderly embraced her, protest∣ing
she was dear to her as ever; and feeling, while
she spoke, her first affection return; but not a
moment had she to bestow from her new mode of
life: some party was always formed which she had
not force of mind to break: an internal restless∣ness,
from the want of some right pursuit, joined
to a disappointment she could not own, made that
party induce another; and though none gave her
real pleasure, which her strong, however undisci∣plined
and unguided feelings, shut out from such
such a species of vague life, all gave employment
to expectation, and were preferable to a regret at
once consuming and mortifying.</P>
<P>Her gentleness, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wever, and her returned
personal kindness, encouraged Camilla to repeat
her admonitions, and engage assistance from Mel∣mond;
who, at any other period, would, uncalled,
have given his whole attention to a sister dear at
once to his honour and his heart; but Indiana
more than occupied, she engrossed him. She now
expected an adoration so unremitting, that if she
surprised his eyes turned any other way even a
moment, she reproached him with abated love,
and it was the business of a day to obtain a re∣conciliation.</P>
<P>Gratefully, however, at the instigation of Ca∣milla,
he resumed the vigilance with which, upon
her first entering London the preceding year, he
had attended to all the actions of his sister. But
the difference already produced by the effect of
<PB N="231" REF="58"/>
flattery, the hardening of example, and the sway
of uncontrolled early power, astonished and alarm∣ed
him. At her first setting out, she had hearken∣ed
to all counsel, frightened by every representa∣tion
of danger, and humbled by every remonstrance
against impropriety. But she now heard him with
little or no emotion; and from beginning to
listen unmoved, soon proceeded to reply and re∣sist.
A search, rather than a love, of pleasure
had seized her young mind, which had now gained
an ascendant that rendered contest less shocking,
than yielding would have been painful.</P>
<P>The tribulation of Melmond at this ill success,
rested not solely upon his sister; he saw yet more
danger for Indiana, who now seemed scarce to
live but while arraying, or displaying herself.
His passion had lost its novelty, and her eyes lost
their beaming pleasure in listening to it; and the
regard he had fondly expected to take place of first
extacy, he now found unattainable, from want of
all materials for its structure. His discourse, when
not of her beauty, but strained her faculties; his
reading, when compelled to hear it, but wearied
her intellects. She had no genius to catch his
meaning, and no attention to supply its place.</P>
<P>Deeply he now thought of Eugenia, with that
regret ever attached to frail humanity, for what is
removed from possible possession. The purity of
her love, the cultivation of her mind, and the
nobleness of her sentiments, now bore forth a
contrast to the general mental and intellectual lit∣tleness
of Indiana, which made him blame the
fastidious eyes, that could dwell upon her face and
form; and feel that, even with the matchless In∣diana,
he must sigh at their mutual perversity of
fate.</P>
<P>Nor missed he more in soul, than Indiana in
adoration, who turned from what she now resented
as coldness, to the violent praises of Macdersey,
who became, at this period, a frequenter of Mrs.
Berlinton's assemblies. She understood not the
<PB N="232" REF="59"/>
inevitable difference of the altered situation; that
he who was accepted might be grateful, but could
not be anxious; and that Melmond, while in sus∣pense,
wore the same impassioned air, and spoke
the same impassioned feelings as Macdersey. To
her, all seemed the change not from doubt to secu∣rity,
but from love to insensibility.</P>
<P>To live always at her feet, while he thought
her all-divine, was his own first joy and greatest
pride: but when once he found his goddess had
every mortal imperfection, his homage ceased,
with amazement that ever it could have been ex∣cited.
Those eyes, thought he, which I have
gazed at whole days with such unreflecting admi∣ration;
and whose shape, colour, size, and sweet
proportion still hold their pre-eminence, now,
while retaining their first lustre, have lost all their
illusory charm! I meet them—but to deplore their
vacancy of the soul's intelligence—I fondly—vainly
seek!”</P>
<P>Even when again the time arrived for returning
to Cleves, Indiana, hanging languidly upon every
minute she could steal from it, petitioned for a few
days more from the ever-granting Baronet, which,
while by her devoted to coquetry, admiration,
and dress, were consumed by Camilla in almost
every species of wretchedness. Mrs. Mittin wrote
her word that Mr. Clykes was become more uneasy
than ever for his money, as she had thought it
indispensable to acquaint him of the reports in the
neighbourhood, that Mr. Tyrold had met with
misfortunes, and was retrenching: if he could not,
therefore, be paid quickly, he must put in his
claims elsewhere.</P>
<P>The same post brought from Lavinia an account
so afflicting of Eugenia, as nearly to annihilate even
this deep personal distress. It was known, through
Molly Mill, who, by the express insistance of
Sir Hugh, continued to live with her young
<PB N="233" REF="60"/>
Mistress, that Bellamy had already, at Belfont,
cast off the mask of pretended passion, and grossly
demanded of her Mistress to beg money for him of
Sir Hugh; acknowledging without scruple, large
debts, that demanded speedy payment, and pressing
her to ask for the immediate possession of the
Yorkshire estate. Her Mistress though mildly,
always steadily refused; which occasioned re∣proaches
so rude and violent as almost to frighten
her into fits; and so loud that they were often
heard by every servant in the house.</P>
<P>Camilla, at this dreadful history, grew nearly
indifferent to all else, and would have relinquished,
almost unrepining, her expectations of personal
relief, but that Lavinia, in the name of their un∣happy
sister, bid her still cherish them; assuring
her she hoped yet to perform her engagement, as
Mr. Bellamy never disputed her already given
promise, though he had mislaid the key of the box
in which the trinkets were deposited.</P>
<P>Nor even here rested the misery of Camilla:
another alarm stole upon her mind, of a nature
the most dreadful.</P>
<P>Upon the first evening of this newly-granted
stay, while she was conversing alone with Mrs.
Berlinton before the nocturnal <HI>toilette</HI> of that lady,
a servant announced Mr. Bellamy. Mrs. Berlinton
blushed high, evidently with as much of anger as
surprise; Camilla hastily withdrawing, to avoid
an object abhorrent to her, wondered she would ad∣mit
him: yet, anxious for any intelligence that could
relate to her sister, enquired when he was gone,
and ran towards the dressing-room to ask what had
passed: but before she reached the door, the sound
of his voice re-entering the hall, and of his step
re-ascending the stairs, made her fly into the ad∣joining
apartment, not to encounter him; where
the instant he had shut the door, and before she
could move, she heard him exclaim, “You weep
still, my lovely friend? Ah! can one doubt so
injurious remain upon your mind, as to suppose
<PB N="234" REF="61"/>
any thing but the cruel necessity of my misfortunes
could have made me tarnish our celestial friendship
with any other engagement? Ah! look at her.…
and look at yourself!”</P>
<P>Camilla, who, at first, had been immoveable from
consternation, now recovered sufficiently to get back
to her room. But she returned no more to Mrs. Ber∣linton,
though Bellamy soon departed; her eagerness
for information subsided in indignant sorrow. That
Eugenia, the injured, the inestimable Eugenia, should
be spoken of, by the very violator who had torn her
from her friends, as a mere burthen attached to the
wealth she procured him, struck at her heart as a
poignard. And the impropriety to herself, and the
wrong to Eugenia, of Mrs. Berlinton, in listening to
such a discourse, totally sunk that lady in her esteem;
though it determined her, as a duty due to them all
around, to represent what she felt upon this subject:
and the next day, the instant she was visible, she
begged an audience.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton was pensive and dejected, but, as
usual, open and unguarded: she began herself to speak
of the visit of Bellamy, and to ask why she ran away.</P>
<P>Camilla, without answer or hesitation, related what
she had overhe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd, adding, “O, Mrs. Berlinton!
can you suffer him to talk thus? Can you think of my
injured Eugenia—lately your own favourite friend—
and bear to hear him?”</P>
<P>“How injured, my ever-dear Camilla? Doe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she
know what he says? Can it hurt her unheard? Can
it affect her unimagined? He but solaces his sadness
by a confidence he holds sacred; 'tis the type of our
friendship, now dearer, he says, than ever, since re∣ciprocated
by such sympathy.”</P>
<P>“You affright me, Mrs. Berlinton! what a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣version
of reason to talk of sympathy in your situ∣ations?
Did Eugenia press him to the altar? Did any
friends solicit the alliance? Oh, Mrs. Berlinton! think
but a moment, and your own feeling mind will paint
his conduct in colours I have not the skill to attain!”</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="62"/>
“You are right!” cried she, blushing in her un∣willing
conviction: “I know not how he could de∣lude
me to believe our fates resembled. Certainly
nothing can be less similar.”</P>
<P>Camilla was happy in this victory; but the follow∣ing
day, Bellamy, at the same hour was announced,
and in the same manner was admitted; Camilla flying,
and Mrs. Berlinton protesting she should attack his
mistaken comparison with severity.</P>
<P>Severity, however, was a quality with which she
was unacquainted; Camilla, anxious in every way,
hastened to her when he was gone, but found her dis∣solved
in tender tears, shed, she declared, in regret of
the uneasiness she had given him, for he had now made
her fully sensible his destiny alone was to blame.</P>
<P>The understanding of Camilla was highly superior
to being duped by such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>limsy sophistry, which she
heard with added detestation of the character of Bel∣lamy;
yet perceived that no remonstrance could pre∣vent
his admittance, and that every interview regular∣ly
destroyed the effect of every exhortation.</P>
<P>In this melancholy period, the sole satisfaction she
received was through a letter written by Lionel from
Ostend, in which he told that the dread of imprison∣ment,
or want, in a foreign country, made him lead
a life so parsimonious, so totally deprived of all plea∣sure
and all comfort, that he was almost consumed
with regret for the wilfulness with which he had
thrown away his innumerable advantages; and so much
struck with the retrospection of the wanton follies and
vices which had involved him in such dishonour and
ruin, that he began now to think he had rather been
mad than wicked;—so unmeaning, unreflecting, and
unprovoked, as well as worthless, had been the course
he had pursued.</P>
<P>Camilla sent this letter immediately to her Father,
who remitted to Lionel such a sum as must obviate
dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ress, with such intimation for the future as he
hoped would best encourage more solid reformation.</P>
<P>Thus passed the time, improperly, or unhappily to
all, till the third period fixed for the return to the
<PB N="236" REF="63"/>
country elapsed; and Camilla, finding the whole view
of her journey abortive, saw the accumulated yet use∣less
suffering involved through her ill-judged procras∣tination.
Yet, as Eugenia still did not despair, even
her confession was unwritten; and as Miss Margland
and Indiana granted her request of going round by
Belfont, which she had previously arranged from an
ardent desire to embrace her loved sister, she still dwelt
on a last hope from that interview.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAP XXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Hints upon National Prejudice.</HEAD>
<P>WITH mingled disquietude and distaste, Melmond
saw the reluctance of Indiana to quit town, and that
he was less than a cypher with her upon the last
evening's assembly, where, without deigning to be∣stow
one look upon him, she chatted, smiled, and flut∣tered
with every one else; undisguisedly betraying, that
he whom she should soon have alone, and have always,
should not rob of even one precious moment this last
splendid blaze of general admiration. He sighed; and
in common with the hapless perverseness of mor∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,
thought he had <HI>thrown away,</HI> in Eugenia, <HI>a gem
richer than all her tribe!</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Shakespeare.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Camilla, whose heart, however dead to joy, was
invariably open to tenderness, was melted wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h fond
emotions in the idea of again meeting her beloved Eu∣genia,
and ready for her journey nearly with the
light.</P>
<P>Soo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after she was dressed, a house maid, tapping
at her door, said, “Pray, Ma'am, is Miss Lynmere
with you?”</P>
<P>“No.”</P>
<P>Presently Miss Margland came herself.”</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="64"/>
“Pray, Miss Camilla, do you know any thing of
Miss Lynmere? It's the oddest thing in the world
where she can be?”</P>
<P>Camilla, now, went forth to aid the search; Mel∣mond,
who was waiting to hand her into the carriage,
looked amazed at the enquiry. It <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon, however, was
clear, that she was no where in the house; and, after
sundry examinations and researches, one of the maids
was brought to confess having aided her, in the mid∣dle
of the night, to go into the street, where she was
handed into a post chaise by Mr. Macdersey.</P>
<P>Melmond appeared thunder struck. An action so
unexpected at the period of a solemn engagement
which waited but the journey to Cleves for being
completed, seemed to him, at first, incredible. But,
when Miss Margland exclaimed, “O pursue her, Mr.
Melmond! order your horse, and gallop to Scotland
Immediately!” he gravely, and rather drily answered:
“By no means, Ma'am! The man who has the ho∣nour
of her preference, is the only one who can have
any hope to make her happy. I have no ambition for
a hand that has been voluntarily held out to another.”</P>
<P>He then returned, quietly, to his own lodgings;
far more indignant than hurt at this abrupt conclusion
of a connexion which, though it had opened to him
as a promise of Elysium, was closing with every me∣nace
of mutual discontent.</P>
<P>Camilla was truly concerned; and not merely for
the future risk run by her Cousin, in this rash flight,
but for the new disappointment to her Uncle. She
was obliged, however, to bestow her whole attention
upon Miss Margland, whose tribulation was yet great∣er,
and who, in losing thus her pupil, lost the expect∣ed
reward of near thirteen years of unwilling attend∣ance.
She had, by no means, indeed, merited this
treachery from Indiana, whom though incapable to
instruct in much good, she had sedulously guarded from
all evil.</P>
<P>To return to Sir Hugh without her charge, with∣out
indeed either of the young ladies who were put
under her care, she had not courage. Nor could Ca∣milla
so little feel for her distress as to request it.
<PB N="238" REF="65"/>
An express, therefore, was ordered to Cleves, for
informing him of those ill tidings, with a very elabo∣rate
panegyric from Miss Margland of her own con∣duct;
and a desire to know if she should remain in
town till something transpired concerning Indiana.</P>
<P>The express was but just gone, when a packet,
which ought to have arrived two days before, by the
stage, was delivered to Camilla. Its intention was
merely to convey more speedily a letter from Lavi∣nia,
containing the terrible information that Mr. Clykes
had just been at Etherington himself, to deliver in
his accounts, and press immediate payment; their Fa∣ther,
Lavinia said, conceived the whole some imposi∣tion,
till the man produced the paper signed by his
daughter. She had then been called in, and obliged
to confess her knowledge of the transaction. She
would avoid, she said, particulars that could be only
uselessly afflicting; but the interview had ended in
their Father's agreeing to pay, when it should be pos∣sible,
the sums actually delivered to the creditors, and
for which Mr. Clykes could produce their own re∣ceipts;
but refusing, positively and absolutely, any
gratuity whatsoever, from detestation of so dangerous
and seductive a species of trade, as clandestine and il∣legal
money-lending to minors. The man, much pro∣voked,
said a friend of his had been used far more
handsomely by Sir Hugh Tyrold; but finding his re∣monstrances
vain, acknowledged the law against him
for the interest; but threatened to send in an account
for his own trouble, in collecting and paying the bills,
that he would dispute, for validity, in any court of
justice to which he could be summoned: and, in leav∣ing
the house, he menaced an immediate writ, if all
he could legally claim were not paid the next day;
unless a new bond were properly signed, with a pro∣mise
to abide by that already drawn up. Their Fa∣ther,
she was forced to confess, had now lent his eve∣ry
guinea, for the debts of Clermont, to Sir Hugh;
and was at this instant, deliberating to whom he should
apply; but desired, meanwhile, an exact statement of
the debts which this man had in commission to dis∣charge.
<PB N="239" REF="66"/>
The letter concluded with Lavinia's unfeign∣ed
grief in the task of writing it.</P>
<P>Camilla read it with a distraction that made it
wholly unintelligible to her; yet could not read it a
second time; her eyes became dim, her faculties con∣fused,
and she rather felt deprived of the power of
thinking, than filled with any new and dreadful sub∣jects
for rumination.</P>
<P>In this state, the letter on the floor, her eyes staring
around, yet looking vacant, and searching nothing,
she was called to Lord O'Lerney, who begged the ho∣nour
of a conference with her upon business.</P>
<P>She shook her head, in token of denial, but could
not speak. The servant looked amazed; yet brought
her a second messenger, that his Lordship was ex∣tremely
sorry to torment her, but wished to communi∣cate
something concerning Mr. Macdersey.</P>
<P>She then faintly articulated, “I can see nobody.”</P>
<P>Still the same dreadful vacuity superseded her sensi∣bility,
till, soon after, she received a note f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om Lady
Isabella Irby, desiring to be admitted to a short con∣versation
with her upon the part of Lord O'Lerney.</P>
<P>With the name of Lady Isabella Irby recurred the
remembrance that she was a favourite of Edgar—and
bursting into tears, she consented to the interview;
which took place immediately.</P>
<P>The terrible state in which she appeared was natu∣rally,
though not justly, attributed by her ladyship to
the elopement of her Cousin: while Camilla, called
by her sight to softer regrets, beheld again, in mental
view, the loved and gentle image of Edgar.</P>
<P>Lady Isabella apologised politely, but briefly, for
her intrusion, saying: “My Lord O'Lerney, whose
judgment is never in any danger, but where wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ped
by his wish of giving pleasure, insists upon it that
you will be less incommoded by a quick forced ad∣mission
of me than of himself. Nobody else will
think so; but it is not easy to refuse him; so here I
am. The motive of this intrusion you can but too
readily divine. Lord O'Lerney is truly concerned at
this rash action in his kinsman, which he learnt by an
<PB N="240" REF="67"/>
accidental call at his lodgings, where various circum∣stances
had just made it known. He could not rest
without desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to see some part of the young lady's
family, and making an offer of his his own best ser∣vices
with respect to some arrangement for her fu∣ture
establishment. It is for this purpose, you have
been so importunately hurried: Lord O'Lerney wish∣ing
to make the first news that is sent to Sir Hugh
Tyrold less alarming, by stating, at once, what he
can communicate concerning Mr. Macdersey.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who only now recollected that Mr. Macder∣sey
was related to Lord O'Lerney, was softened into
some attention, and much gratitude for his goodness,
and for her Ladyship's benevolence in being its messen∣ger.</P>
<P>“Will you, then,” said Lady Isabella, “now
you understand the purport of his visit, see Lord
O'Lerney himself? He can give you much better and
clearer documents than I can; and it is always the
best and shortest mode to deal with principals.</P>
<P>Camilla mechanically complied, and Lady Isabella
sent her footman with a note to his Lordship, who was
waiting at her house in Park-lane:</P>
<P>The discourse still fell wholly upon Lady Isabella;
Camilla, lost alternately in misery and absence, spoke
not, heard not; yet former scenes, though not present
circumstances, were brought to her mind by the ob∣ject
before her, and almost with reverence, she looked
at the favourite of Edgar, in whose sweetness of coun∣tennance,
good sense, delicacy, and propriety, she con∣ceived
herself reading every moment the causes of his
approbation. Ah, why, thought she, while unable
to reply, or to listen to what was said, why knew I
not this charming woman, while yet he took an inte∣rest
in my conduct and connexions! Perhaps her gen∣tle
wisdom might have drawn me into its own path!
how would he have delighted to have seen me under
such influence! how now, even now,—lost to him as
I am!—would he generously rejoice, could he view
the condescending partiality of looks and manner that
seem to denote her disposition to kindness!</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="68"/>
Lord O'Lerney soon joined them; and after
thanking Camilla for granting, and his Ambassa∣dress
for obtaining him an audience, said; “I have
been eager for the honour of a conference with
Miss Tyrold, in the hope of somewhat alleviating
the fears for the future, that may naturally join
with displeas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re for the present, from the very un∣advised
step of this morning. But, however wrong
the manner in which this marriage may be effect∣ed,
the alliance in itself will not I hope, be so dis∣advantageous,
as matches of this expeditious cha∣racter
prove in general. The actual possessions of
Macdersey are, indeed, far beneath what Miss
Lynmere, with her uncommon claims, might de∣mand;
but his expectations are considerable, and
well founded; and his family will all come forward
to meet her, with every mark of respect, for
which, as its head, I shall lead the way. He is
honest, honourable, and good natured; not parti∣cularly
endowed with judgment or discretion,
but by no means wanting in parts, though they
are rather wild and eccentric.”</P>
<P>His Lordship then gave a full and satisfactory
detail of the present state, and future hopes of his
kinsman; and added, that it should be his own
immediate care to endeavour to secure for the fair
bride a fixed settlement, from the rich old cousin
who had long promised to make Macdersey his
heir. He told Camilla to write this, without de∣lay,
to the young lady's Uncle, with full leave to
use his name and authority.</P>
<P>“At all times,” he continued, “it is necessary
to be quick, and as explicit as possible, in repre∣senting
what can conciliate an adventure of this
sort, of which the clandestine measure implies on
one side, if not on both, something wrong; but
most especially it is necessary to use speed
where the flight is made with an Hibernian; for
with the English in general, it is nearly enough
that a man should be born in Ireland, to decide
him for a fortune-hunter. If you lived, how∣ever,
in that country, you would see the matter
<PB N="242" REF="69"/>
pretty equally arranged; and that there are not
more of our pennyless beaux who return laden
with the commodity of rich wives, than of those
better circumstanced who bring home wives with
more estimable dowries.”</P>
<P>He then added, that it was from Miss Lynmere
herself he had learnt the residence of Camilla in
Grosvenor-square; for, having made some ac∣quaintance
with her at one of Mrs. Berlinton's
evening parties, he had heard she was a niece of
Sir Hugh Tyrold, and immediately enquired after
her fair kinswoman, whom he had seen at Tun∣bridge.</P>
<P>Camilla thanked him for remembering her; and
Lady Isabella, with a countenance that implied
approbation in the remark, said; “I have never
once heard of Miss Tyrold at the assemblies of this
house.”</P>
<P>She quietly replied she had never been present
at them; but a look of sensibility with which her
eyes dropt, spoke more than she intended, of
concern at their existence, or at least frequency.</P>
<P>“Your lovely young Hostess,” said Lord O'Ler∣ney,
“has entered the world at too early an hour
to be aware of the surfeit she is preparing herself,
by this unremitting luxury of pleasure; but I
know so well her innocence and good qualities,
that I doubt not but the error will bring its own
cure, and she will gladly return to the literary and
elegant intercourse, which she has just now given
up for one so much more tumultuous.”</P>
<P>“I am glad you still think so, my Lord;” said
Lady Isabella, also looking down; “she is a very
sweet creature, and the little I have seen of her,
made me, while in her sight, warmly her well-wisher.
Nevertheless I should rather see any
young person, for whom I was much interested,
—unless endowed with the very remarkable for∣bearance
of Miss Tyrold,—under her influence
after the period your Lordship expects to return,
than during its <HI>interregnum!</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="70"/>
Camilla disavowed all claim to such praise, blush∣ing
both for her friend and herself at what was said.
Lord O'Lerney, looking concerned, paused, and then
answered, “You know my partiality for Mrs. Berlin∣ton:
yet I always see with fresh respect the courage
with which my dear Lady Isabella casts aside her na∣tive
reserve and timidity, where she thinks a hint—an
intimation—may do good, or avert dangers.”</P>
<P>His eye was then fixed upon Camilla, who surpriz∣ed,
turned hastily to Lady Isabella, and saw a tender
compassion in her countenance, that confirmed the in∣terpretation
of Lord O'Lerney; joined with a modest
confusion that seemed afraid, or ashamed, of what had
escaped her.</P>
<P>Grateful for herself, but extremely grieved for the
idea that seemed to have gone forth of Mrs. Berlinton,
she felt a tear start into her eye. She chaced it, with
as little emotion as she could shew; and Lord O'Ler∣ney,
with an air of gayer kindness, said; “As we
must now, Miss Tyrold, account ourselves to be
somewhat allied, you permit me, I hope, to recom∣mend
my gallant Cousin to your protection with Sir
Hugh? That he has his share of the wildness, the
blunders, the eccentricities, and the rhodomontade,
which form, with you English, our stationary national
character, must not be denied; but he has also, what
may equally, I hope, be given us in the lump, gene∣rosity,
spirit, and good intentions. With all this—”</P>
<P>He was here interrupted; the door being suddenly
burst open by Mrs. Mittin, who entered, exclaiming,
“Lord, Miss, what a sad thing this is! I declare its
put me quite into a quiver! And all Winchester's
quite in an uproar, as one may say. You never see
how every body's in a turmoil!”</P>
<P>Here ended the little interval of horror in Camilla.
Mrs. Mittin and Mrs. Clykes seemed to her as one;
yet that, already, her Cousin's elopement should have
spread so near home, seemed impossible. “When,”
she cried, “were you in Winchester? And how came
this affair known to you?”</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="71"/>
“Known? why, my dear Miss, it was there it all
happened. I come through it with Mr. Dennel, who
was so obliging as to bring me to town, for a little
business I've got to do; and next week he'll take me
back again; for as to poor little Mrs. Lissin, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'ll be
quite lost without me. She don't know her right hand
from her left, as one may say. But how should she,
poor child? Why she is but a baby. What's fifteen?
And she's no more.”</P>
<P>“We'll talk of that,” said Camilla, colouring at
her loquacious familiarity, “some other time.” And
attempted to beg Lord O'Lerney would finish what he
was saying. But Mrs. Mittin, somewhat affronted,
cried, “Lord, only think of your sitting here, talk∣ing,
and making yourself so comfortable, just as if
nothing was the matter! when every body else is in
such a taking as never was the like! I must say, as to
that, a gentleman more liked, and in more respect ne∣ver
was, I believe; and I can't say but what I'm
very sorry myself for what Mr. Clykes has done; how∣ever,
I told you, you know, you'd best not provoke
him; for though there can't be a better sort of man,
he'll leave no stone unturned to get his money.”</P>
<P>“For Heaven's sake,” cried Camilla, startled,
“what—”</P>
<P>“What?—Why, Lord, Miss! don't you know
your Papa's took up? He's put in Winchester Prison,
for that debt, you know.”</P>
<P>The breath of Camilla instantly stopt, and senseless,
lifeless, she sunk upon the floor.”</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney quitted the room in great concern,
to call some female assistants; but Lady Isabella re∣mained,
contributing with equal tenderness and judg∣ment
to her aid, though much personally affected by
the incident.</P>
<P>Her recovery was quick, but it was only to des∣pair;
to screams rather than lamentations, to cries ra∣ther
than tears. Her reason felt the shock as forcibly
as her heart: the one seemed tottering on its seat,
the other bursting its abode. Words of alarming in∣coherency
proclaimed the danger menacing her intel∣lects,
<PB N="245" REF="72"/>
while agonies nearly convulsive distorted her
features, and writhed her form.</P>
<P>Unaffectedly shocked, yet not venturing, upon so
slight an acquaintance, to interfere, Lady Isabella ut∣tered
gently but impressively her good wishes and con∣cern,
and glided away.</P>
<P>The nearly distracted Camilla saw not that she went;
and knew no longer that she had been in the room. She
held her forehead one moment; called for death the
next; and the next wildly deprecated eternal punishment.
But as the horror nearly intolerable of this first abrupt
blow gave way, the desire of flying instantly to her
father was the symptom of restor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d recollection.</P>
<P>Hastening then to Miss Margland, she conjured her,
by all that was most affecting, to set off immediately
for Winchester. But Miss Margland, though she
spared not the most severe attacks upon the already
self-condemned and nearly-demolished Camilla, always
found something relative to herself that was more
pressing than what could regard any other, and de∣clared
she could not stir from town till she received
an answer from Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Camilla besought at least to have the carriage; but
of this she asserted herself at present the indisputable
mistress, and as the express might come back in a few
hours, with directions that she should set off immedi∣ately,
she would not listen to parting with it. Ca∣milla,
frantic to be gone, flew then down st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and
called to the porter in the hall, that some one should
instantly seek her a chaise, coach, or any conveyance
whatever, that could carry her to Winchester.</P>
<P>She perceived not that Lady Isabella, waiting for
her footman, who had, accidentally, gone on further,
upon some message, now opened the door of the par∣lour,
where Lord O'Lerney was conversing with her
upon what had happened: she was flying back, though
not knowing whither nor which way she turned, when
Lord O'Lerney, gently stopping her, asked, why she
would not, on such an emergence, apply for the carri∣age
of Mrs. Berlinton? Lady Isabella seconded the
motion, by a soft, but just hint, of the danger of her
<PB N="246" REF="73"/>
taking such a journey, in a hired carriage, entirely
unprotected.</P>
<P>She had scarce consideration enough left to either
thank or understand them, yet mechanically followed
their counsel, and went to Mrs. Berlinton; Lord
O'Lerney, deeply touched by her distress, sending
in a servant at the same time with his name, and fol∣lowing:
while Lady Isabella, too much interested to
go till something was decided, quietly shut herself
into the parlour, there to wait his Lordship's informa∣tion.</P>
<P>The request for the carriage was, indeed, rather
made by him than by Camilla, who, when she entered
the room, and would have spoken, found herself de∣prived
of the power of utterance, and looked a picture
of speechless dismay.</P>
<P>The tender feelings of Mrs Berlinton were all im∣mediately
awakened by this sight, and she eagerly an∣swered
Lord O'Lerney, that both her carriage and
herself should be devoted to her distressed friend; yet,
the first emotion over, she recollected an engagement
she could not break, though one she hesitated to men∣tion,
and at last only alluded to unexplained, though
making known it was insurmountable; while the co∣lour,
of which her late hours had robbed her lovely
cheeks, returned to them as she stammered her retracta∣tion.</P>
<P>The next day, however, she was beginning to pro∣mise,
—but Camilla, to whom the next minute seem∣ed
endless, flew down again to the hall, to supplicate
the first sootman she could meet, to run and order any
sort of carriage he could find; with but barely suffici∣ent
recollection to refrain running out with that view
herself.</P>
<P>Lady Isabella, again coming forth, entreated to
know if there were any commission, any possible ser∣vice
she could herself perform. Camilla thanked her,
without knowing what she said; and Lord O'Lorney,
who was descending the stairs, repeated similar offers.
But wild with affright, or shuddering with horror, she
passed without hearing or observing him.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="74"/>
To see a young creature in a state so deplorable,
and to consider her as travelling without any friend or
support, in so shaken a condition, to visit an imprison∣ed
Father, touched those benign observers with the
sincerest commiseration; and the connexion of a part
of his family forming at this moment with a branch
of her own, induced Lord O'Lerney to believe he
was almost bound to take care of her himself. “And
yet,” said he to Lady Isabella, “though I am old
enough to be her grandfather, the world, should I
travel with her, might impute my assistance to a spe∣cies
of admiration which I hope to experience no
more—as witness my trusting myself so much with
Lady Isabella Irby!”</P>
<P>Lady Isabella, from the quick coincidence of similar
feelings, instantly conceived his wishes, and paused
to weigh their possibility. A short consideration was
sufficient for this purpose. It brought to her memo∣ry
her various engagements; but it represented at the
same time to her benevolence that they would be all,
by the performance of one good action,</P>
<P>More honour'd in the breach than the observance:</P>
<P>She sent, therefore, a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssage after Camilla, en∣treating
a short conference.</P>
<P>Camilla, who was trying to comprehend some fur∣ther
account from Mrs. Mitten, silently, but hastily
obeyed the call; and her look of wild anguish would
have fixed the benign intention of Lady Isabella, had
it been wavering. In a simple phrase, but with a
manner the most delicate, her Ladyship then offered
to conduct her to Winchester. A service so unex∣pected,
a goodness so consoling, instantly brought
Camilla to the use of her frightened away faculties,
but with sensations of gratitude so forcible, that Lord
O'Lerney with difficulty saved her from falling at the
seet of his amiable friend, and with yet more difficul∣ty
restrained his own knees from doing her that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣mage.
And still the more strongly he felt this active
exertion, from the disappointment he had just endure<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
through the failure of his favourite Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="75"/>
No time was to be lost; Lady Isabella determined
to do well what she once undertook to do at all;
she went to Park-lane, to make known her excur∣sion,
and arrange some affairs, and then instantly
returned, in her own post-chaise and four horses,
for Camilla; who was driven from the metropolis.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="26" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Operation of Terror.</HEAD>
<P>LADY Isabella, for the first two or three miles,
left Camilla uninterruptedly to her own thoughts;
she then endeavoured to engage her in some discourse,
but was soon forced to desist. Her misery exceeded
all measure of restraint, all power of effort. Her
Father in prison! and for her own debts! The
picture was too horrible for her view, yet too
adhesive to all her thoughts, all her feelings, all
her faculties, to be removed from them a moment.
Penetrated by what she owed to Lady Isabella, she
frequently took her hand, pressed it between her
own, pressed it to her lips; but could shew her
no other gratitude, and force herself to no other
exertion.</P>
<P>It was still early, they travelled post, and with
four horses, and arrived at Winchester before
eight o'clock.</P>
<P>Shaking, she entered the town, half fainting,
half dead. Lady Isabella would have driven straight
on to Etherington, which was but a stage further;
but to enter the rectory, whence the Rector him∣self
was torn—“No!” cried she, “no! there
where abides my Father, there alone will I abide!
No roof shall cover my head, but that which
covers his! I have no wish but to sink at his feet—
to crawl in the dust—to confine myself to the
hardest labour for the remnant of my miserable
<PB N="249" REF="76"/>
existence, so it might expiate but this guilty out∣rage!</P>
<P>Lady Isabella took not any advantage of the an∣guish
that was thus bursting forth with secret
history; she was too delicate and too good to
seize such a moment for surprising confidence, and
only required if she had any friend in the town,
who could direct her whither to go, and accom∣pany
as well as direct.</P>
<P>She knew no one with sufficient intimacy to en∣dure
presenting herself to them upon such an
occasion; and preferred proceeding alone to the
sad and cruel interview. Lady Isabella ordered
the chaise to an hotel, where she was shewn into a
room up stairs, whence she sent one of her own
servants to enquire out where debtors were con∣fined,
and if Mr. Tyrold were in custody: charg∣ing
him not to name, from whom or why he came,
and begging Camilla to get ready a note to prepare
her Father for the meeting, and prevent any
affecting surprise. She then went to chuse herself
a chamber, determined not to quit her voluntary
charge, till she saw her in the hands of her own
friends.</P>
<P>Camilla could not write: to kneel, to weep, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sue,
was all she could bear to plan; to present to
him the sight of her hand writing she had not
courage.</P>
<P>Presently she heard a chaise drive rapidly through
the inn gate: it might be he, perhaps released;
she flew down the stairs with that hope; but no
sooner had descended them, than a dread of his
view took its place, and she ran back: she stopt,
however, in the landing place, to hear who entered.</P>
<P>Suddenly a voice struck her ear that made her
start; that vibrated quick to her heart, and there
seemed to arrest the springs of life: she thought it
the voice of her Mother—</P>
<P>It ceased to speak; and she dropt on one knee,
inwardly, but fervently praying her senses might
deceive her.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="77"/>
Again, however, and more distinctly, it reached
her; doubt then ceased, terror next to horror
took its place. What was said she knew not, her
trepidation was too great to take in more than the
sound.</P>
<P>Prostrate she fell on the floor; but hearing a
waiter say, “Up stairs, madam, you may have a
room to yourself.” She started, rose, and rushing
violently back to the apartment she had quitted,
bolted herself in; exclaiming “I am not worthy
to see you, my Mother! I have cast my Father in∣to
prison—and I know you will abhor me!”</P>
<P>She then sat down against the door, to listen if
she were pursued; she heard a footstep, a female
step; she concluded it that of her Mother; She
can come,” cried she, “but to give me her male∣diction!”
And flew frantic about the room, look∣ing
for any means of escape, yet perceiving only
the window, whence she must be dashed to de∣struction.</P>
<P>She now heard a hand upon the lock of the
door. “O that I could die! that I could die!”
she cried, madly advancing to the window, and
throwing up the sash, yet with quick instinctive
repentance pulling it down, shuddering and ex∣claiming:
“Is there no death for me but murder
—no murder but suicide?”</P>
<P>A voice now found its way through her cries to
her ear, that said, “It is I, my dear Miss
Tyrold; will you not admit me?”</P>
<P>It was Lady Isabella; but her mother might be
with her: she could not, however, refuse to open
the door, though desperately she said to herself:
If she is there, I will pass her, and rush into the
streets!</P>
<P>Seeing, however, Lady Isabella alone, she dropt
on her knees, ejaculating “Thank Heaven! thank
Heaven! one moment yet I am spared!”</P>
<P>“What is it, my dear Miss Tyrold,” said Lady
Isabella, “that causes you this sudden agony?
what can it be that thus dreadfully disorders you?”</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="78"/>
“Is she with you?” cried she, in a voice scarce
audible, “does she follow me? does she demand
my Father?”</P>
<P>“Rise, dear madam, and compose yourself. If
you mean a Lady whom this minute I have passed,
and whose countenance so much resembles yours,
that I thought her at once some near relation, she
is just gone from this house.”</P>
<P>“Thank Heaven! thank Heaven!” again eja∣culated
the prostrate Camilla; “My Mother is
spared a little longer the dreadful sight of all she
must now most abominate upon earth!”</P>
<P>She then then begged Lady Isabella instantly to
order the chaise, and return to town.</P>
<P>“On the contrary,” answered her Ladyship,
extremely surprised at so wild a request, “Let me
rather, myself, carry you to your family.”</P>
<P>“O no, Lady Isabella, no! cried Camilla,
speaking with frightful rapidity, and shaking in
every limb, “all now is changed. I came to wait
upon my Father—to humble myself at his feet—
not to obtrude myself upon my Mother!—O Lady
Isabella!—I shall have broken her heart—and I
dare not offend her with my sight!”</P>
<P>Lady Isabella, with the most judicious gentle∣ness,
endeavoured to render her more reasonable.
“I pretend not,” she said, “to decide upon your
situation, though I comprehend its general afflic∣tion:
yet still, and at all events, its termination
must be a meeting. Suffer me, therefore, rather
to hasten than retard so right a measure. Allow
of my mediation, and give me the infinite plea∣sure
of leaving you in the hands of your friends.”</P>
<P>Camilla, though scarcely able to articulate her
words, declared again the motive to her journey was
at an end; that her Father had now one to watch,
soothe, and attend him, who had none of her
dreadful drawbacks to consoling powers; and that
she would remain at Mrs Berlinton's till summoned
home by their immediate commands.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="79"/>
Lady Isabella began pleading their own rights to
decide if or not the meeting should be deferred:
but wildly interrupting her, “You know not,”
she cried, “what it is you ask. I have not nerves,
I have not hardiness to force myself into such a
presence. An injured Father—an offended
Mother—O Lady Isabella! if you knew how
I adore—and how I have ruined them!—”</P>
<P>“Let me go to them from you, myself; let me
represent your situation. They are now probably
together. That Lady whom I saw but from the
stairs, though her countenance so much struck me,
and whom I now conclude to be Mrs. Tyrold,
said, as she passed, I shall walk; I only want a
guide;”—</P>
<P>“They had not, then, even met!” cried Ca∣milla,
starting up with fresh horror; “she is but
just arrived—has but just been at Etherington—
and there heard—that her husband was in prison—
and in prison for the debts of her daughter! her
guilty—perhaps reprobated daughter!”—</P>
<P>Again, wringing her hands, half distracted, “O,
that the earth,” she cried, “had received me, ere
I quitted the parental roof! Innocent I had then
died, beloved, regretted,—no shame would have
embittered my Father's sorrow—no wrath my
Mother's—no culpable misconduct would have
blighted with disgrace their so long—long wished-for
meeting!</P>
<P>The compassionating, yet judicious Lady Isabella,
willing to shorten the sufferings she pitied, made
yet another effort to prevent this unadvised return,
by proposing they should both sleep this night at
Winchester, that Camilla might gather some par∣ticulars
of her family, and some composure for
herself, to better judge what step to pursue. But
all desire of meeting was now converted into hor∣ror;
she was too much known in the neighbour∣hood
to escape being recognized if she stayed till
the morning, and her shattered intellects, she de∣clared
could not bear passing a whole night in ex∣pectation
<PB N="253" REF="80"/>
of a discovery through some accident.
“Have I not already,” cried she, “heard her
voice and fled its sound? Judge then, Lady Isa∣bella,
if I can present myself before her! No, I
must write, first. I have a long and dreadful
history to relate—and then, when she has heard
it—and when the rectory has again its reverend
master—and when they find some little palliation,
where now they can see only guilt—and when all
is committed without disguise to their goodness—
their mercy—they may say to me perhaps them∣selves:
Unhappy Camilla! thou hast paid thy
just penalty; come home, then, to thy parent's
roof, thou penitent child!”</P>
<P>Lady Isabella knew too little of the characters
with which she had to deal, to judge if it would
be right to insist any further: she ordered, there∣fore
fresh horses to her chaise, and as soon as her
footman came back, who brought the now useless
direction where Mr. Tyrold was to be found, they
gallopped out of Winchester.</P>
<P>At Alton they stopt to sleep; and, her imme∣diate
terror removed, she became mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sensible of
what she owed to Lady Isabella, to whom in the
course of the evening, she recounted frankly the
whole history of her debts, except what related to
Lionel.</P>
<P>“Your Ladyship hears me,” said she, in conclu∣sion,
“with the patience of benevolence, though
I fear, with the censure of all judgment. What
evils have accrued from want of consideration and
foresight! My errors have all been doubled by
concealment—every mischief has been augmented
by delay. O, Lady Isabella! how sad an example
shall I add to your powers of benign instruction!—
From day to day, from hour to hour, I planned
expedients, where I ought to have made confes∣sions!
To avoid one dreadful—but direct evil,
what I have suffered has been nearly intolerable—
what I have inflicted, unpardonable!”</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="81"/>
Lady Isabella, much touched by her openness
and confidence repaid them by all that compassion
could suggest, or that a sincere disposition towards
esteem could anticipate of kindness. She gathered
the amount of the sum for which Mr. Tyrold was
confined, and besought Camilla to let it less weigh
upon her spirits, as she could herself undertake
that Lord O'Lerney would accommodate him with
it immediately, and wait his perfect leisure for
re-payment. “I have known him,” said she,
“from a child, and have always seen, with respect
and admiration the prompt pleasure with which
he rather seizes than accepts every opportunity to
do good.”</P>
<P>Camilla returned the most grateful thanks; but
acknowledged she had no apprehension but that
the writ would immediately be withdrawn, as the
county almost filled with friends to her Father,
who would come forward upon such an occasion.
“What rests thus upon my mind,” said she, “and
what upon his—and upon my Mother's will rest—
is the disgrace—and the cause! the one so public,
the other so clandestine! And besides, though this
debt will be easily discharged, its payment by a
loan is but incurring another: and how that is to
be paid, I know not indeed. Alas! Lady Isabella!
—the Father I have thus dreadfully involved, has
hitherto, throughout his exemplary life, held it a
sacred duty to adapt his expences to his income!”</P>
<P>Again Lady Isabella gave what consolation she
could bestow; and in return for her trust, said she
would speak to her with sincerity upon a point of
much delicacy. It was of her friend, Mrs. Ber∣linton;
“who now,” said she, “you are not,
perhaps, aware, is become a general topic of dis∣course.
To the platonics, with which she set out
in life, she has, of late, joined coquetry; nor
even there stops the ardour with which she seeks
to animate her existence; to two characters, hi∣therto
thought the most contradictory, the senti∣mental
and the flirting, she unites yet a third, till
<PB N="255" REF="82"/>
now believed incompatible with the pleasures and
pursuits of either; this, I need not tell you, is that
of a gamestress. And when to three such attri∣butes
is added an open aversion to her husband, a
professed, an even boasted hatred of his person, his
name, his very being—what hope can be enter∣tained,
be her heart, her intentions, what they
may, that the various dangers she sets at defiance,
will not ultimately take their revenge, and sur∣prise
her in their trammels?”</P>
<P>Edgar himself seemed, to Camilla, to be speak∣ing
in this representation; and that idea made it
catch her attention, in the midst of her utmost
misery. She urged, however, all she knew, and
could suggest, in favour of Mrs. Berlinton; and
Lady Isabella expressed much concern in occasion∣ing
her any painful sensations. “But who,” said
she, “can see you thus nearly, and not be inter∣ested
in your happiness? And I have known, alas!
—though I am still under thirty, instances innu∣merable
of self-deluded young women, who, trust∣ing
to their own pure intentions, have neither
feared nor heeded the dangers which encircled
them, till imperceptibly, from the insidious influ∣ence
of levity, they have pursued the very course
they began with disclaiming, and followed the very
steps from which at first they unaffectedly recoiled.”</P>
<P>Instructed and grateful, though incapable of
being tranquillised. Camilla the next day reached
Grosvenor square long before her fair friend had
left her downy pillow. Lady Isabella exacted a
promise to be informed of her proceedings, and
loaded with merited acknowledgments, returned
to her own mansion.</P>
<P>Camilla took possession of the first room in
which she found a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and ink, and wrote instantly
to Lavinia a short, rapid, and incoherent letter,
upon the distraction of her mind at the dreadful
calamity she had occasioned her Father, and the
accumulated horrors to which her Mother had re∣turned.
She durst not present herself before them
<PB N="256" REF="83"/>
uncalled, not even by letter; but she would live in
the strictest retirement and penance till they or∣dered
her home, for which epoch, not more
longed than dreaded, she besought her sister's me∣diation.</P>
<P>This sent off, she forced herself to wait upon
Miss Margland, who had received an answer from
Cleves to continue in town till Indiana wrote or
re-appeared. She was put immediately into un∣common
good humour, by the ill success of the
journey of Camilla, which she protested was ex∣actly
what she expected.</P>
<P>Camilla then strove to recollect all she had been
told by Lord O'Lerney of Mr. Macdersey, and to
relate it to Miss Margland, who, pleased and sur∣prised,
undertook to write it to Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>To three days of dreadful suspense she now saw
herself inevitably condemned, in waiting an answer
from Lavinia: but as her eyes were opened to re∣mark,
by the admonitions of Lady Isabella, and
her attention was called back to the earlier cautions
of Edgar, her time, though spent with misery,
hung not upon her unoccupied. She thought her∣self
called upon by every tie of friendship, faith∣fully
and courageously to represent to Mrs. Berlin∣ton
her impropriety of conduct with regard to
Bellamy, and the reports that were spread abroad
to her more general disadvantage.</P>
<P>Her reception from that Lady, she had thought,
for the first time cold. She had welcomed her,
indeed, with an accustomed embrace, but her
kindness seemed strained, her smile was faint, and
the eyes which so softly used to second it, were
averted.</P>
<P>As soon as they were alone together, Camilla
took her hand; but, without returning its pressure,
Mrs. Berlinton presented her with a new poem for
her evening's amusement.</P>
<P>Camilla put it down, but while hesitating how
to begin, Bellamy was announced. She started,
and flew away, but returned when he was gone,
and begged a conference.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="84"/>
Mrs. Berlinton answered certainly; though she look∣ed
embarrassed, and added not immediately, as she
was obliged to dress for the evening.</P>
<P>Camilla entreated she might speak with her before
dinner the next day.</P>
<P>To this she received a gentle assent: but no inter∣view
at the time appointed took place; and when
at dinner they met, no notice was taken of the ne∣glect.</P>
<P>She now saw she was pointedly avoided. Her cou∣rage,
however, was called upon, her gratitude was
indebted for past kindnesses, and her honour felt a
double engagement. The opportunity therefore she
could not obtain by request, she resolved to seize by
surprise.</P>
<P>Bellamy was again, however, announced; but the
moment that, from her own chamber, she heard him
descend the stairs, she flew to the dressing-room, and
abruptly entered it.</P>
<P>The surprise she gave was not greater than that she
received. Mrs. Berlinton, her fine eyes streaming
with tears, and her white hands uplifted with an air
of supplication, was evidently in an act of devotion.
Camilla drew back, and would have retired, but she
hastily dried her eyes, and said: “Miss Tyrold, do
you want me? where's Miss—Miss Marg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and?”</P>
<P>“Ah! my dearest Mrs. Berlinton! my friend, as
I had hoped, and by me, surely I trust loved for ever,”
cried Camilla, throwing her arms round her neck,
“why this sorrow? why this distance? why this un∣kind
avoidance?”</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who, at first, had shrunk from her
embrace, now fell, in trembling agitation, upon her
breast. Camilla hoped this was the instant to im∣prove;
when she appeared to be, herself, calling re∣ligion
to her aid, and when the tenderness of her ap∣peal
seemed to bring back a movement of her first
partiality.” “Suffer, suffer me,” she therefore cri∣ed,
“to speak to you now! hear me, my dear and
amiable friend, with the sweetness that first won my
affection!”</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="85"/>
“Mrs. Berlinton, affrighted, drew back, acknow∣ledging
herself unhappy; but shrinking from all dis∣course,
and starting when Camilla named Bellamy,
with a confusion she vainly strove to repress.</P>
<P>Unhackneyed in the world as was Camilla, her
understanding and sense of right stood here in the place
of experience, to point out the danger and impropriety
surrounding her friend; and catching her by the gown,
as she would have quitted the room, “Mrs. Berlin∣ton,”
she emphatically cried, “if you persist in this
unhappy, this perilous intercourse, you risk your re∣putation,
you risk my sister's peace, you risk even
your own future condemnation!—O forgive me—for∣give
me! I see how I have affected you—but you
would listen to no milder words!”</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton had sunk upon a chair; her hands
clasped upon her forehead, and tears running rapidly
down her cheeks. Brought up with religious terrors,
yet ill instructed in religious principles, the dread of
future punishment nearly demolished her, though no
regular creed of right kept her consistently or systema∣tically
in any uniform exercise of good. But thus
forcibly surprised into sudden conscientious recollec∣tions,
she betrayed, rather than opened her heart, and
acknowledged that she was weeping at a denial she
had given to Bellamy; who, molested by the impossi∣bility
of ever conversing with her undisturbed, had
entreated her to grant him, from time to time, a few
hours society, in a peaceful retirement. “Nor
should I—nor could I—” she cried, refuse him—for
I have every reliance in his honour—but that the
guilty world, ignorant of the purity of our friendship,
might causelessly alarm my brother for my fame. And
this, and the fear of any—though so groundless—
uneasiness to your sister, makes me resist his powerful
eloquence, and even my own notions of what is
due to our exalted league of friendship.”</P>
<P>Camilla listened with horror to this avowal, yet
saw, with compassion, that her friend endeavoured
to persuade herself she was free from wrong; though
<PB N="259" REF="86"/>
with censure, that she sought to gloss over, rather than
investigate, every doubt to the contrary: but while
fear was predominant for the event of such a situation
to herself, abhorrence filled her whole mind against
Bellamy, in every part, every plan, and every proba∣bility
of the business.</P>
<P>“O Mrs. Berlinton!” she cried, “conquer this
terrible infatuation, which obscures danger from your
sight, and right from your discernment! Mr. Bellamy
is married; and if you think, yourself, my sister
would be hurt to know of these unhallowed leagues
and bonds, you must be sure, with the least reflection,
that they are wrong; you too, are married; and if
Mr. Melmond would join with the world in contemn∣ing
the extraordinary project you mention, you must
feel, with the least reflexion, it ought not to be grant∣ed.
Even were you both single, it would be equally
improper, though not so wide spreading in its mischief.
I have committed many errors; yet not one of them
wilfully, or against conviction: nevertheless, the ill
consequences that have ensued, tear me at this mo∣ment
with repentant sorrow:—Ah! think then, what
you—so tender, so susceptible, so feeling, will suffer,
if with your apprehensions all awake, you listen to
any request that may make my sister unhappy, or in∣volve
your deserving brother in any difficulty or ha∣zard!”</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton was now subdued. Touched, terri∣fied,
and convinced, she embraced Camilla, wept in
her arms, and promised to see Bellamy no more.</P>
<P>The next day arrived an answer from Lavinia, long,
minute, and melancholy, but tenderly affectionate and
replete with pity.</P>
<P>“Ah, my sister,” she began, “we cannot yet
meet! Our Mother is in no state to bear any added
emotion. The firmness of her whole character, the
fortitude of her whole life, hitherto unbroken by any
passion, and superior to any misfortune, have both
given way, suddenly and dreadfully, to the scene fol∣lowing
her arrival.”</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="87"/>
She then went back to particulars.</P>
<P>Mr. Clykes, she had heard, finding his bill for his
own trouble positively refused, had conceived the Ty∣rold
family in danger of bankruptcy, by the general
rumours of the joint claimants of Lionel and Cler∣mont;
and imagining he had no time to lose, hoped
by an arrest to frighten their Father to terms, in order
to obviate the disgrace of such a measure. Their Fa∣ther
would however, hear of none, nor pay any thing
above the exact amount of the signed receipts of the
various creditors; and submitted to the confinement,
in preference to applying to any friend to be his bail,
till he could consult with a lawyer. He was already
at Winchester, where he had given Clykes a meet∣ing,
when the writ was served against him. He sent
a dispatch to Etherington, to prevent any surprise at
his not returning, and to desire the affair might not
travel to Cleves, where Lavinia was then with Sir
Hugh. This note, addressed to the upper servant,
fell into the hands of Mrs. Tyrold herself, the next
evening, upon her sudden arrival. She had been thus
unexpectedly brought back by the news of the flight of
Bellamy with Eugenia; her brother was still ill, but
every consideration gave way to the maternal; and in
the hope to yet resue her daughter from this violator,
she set off in a packet which was just sailing. But
what, upon descending from the chaise, was the hor∣ror
of her first news! She went on instantly to Win∣chester,
and alighting at an hotel, took a guide and
went to the place of confinement.</P>
<P>“The meeting that ensued,” continued Lavinia,
“no one witnessed, but every one may imagine. I
will not therefore, wound your feelings, my dearest
Camilla, with even touching upon my own. The
impression, however, left upon the mind of our poor
Mother, I should try vainly to disguise, since it has
given her a shock that has forced from me the open∣ing
of this letter.”</P>
<P>She then besought her to take, nevertheless, some
comfort, since she had the unspeakable satisfaction to
inform her that their Father was returned to the rec∣tory.
<PB N="261" REF="88"/>
He had been liberated, from the writ's being
withdrawn; though without his consent, without even
his knowledge, and contrary to his wishes. Nor was
it yet ascertained by whom this was done, though cir∣cumstances
allowed no division to their conjectures.</P>
<P>Harry Westwyn had learnt the terrible event in a
ride he had accidentally taken to Winchester; and,
upon returning to Cleves, had communicated it, with
the most feeling circumspection, to herself. The ex∣cess
of grief with which she had heard him, had
seemed to penetrate to his quickly sensitive soul, “for
he is yet more amiable▪” she added, “than his Fa∣ther's
partiality paints him;” they agreed not to name
it to Sir Hugh; though Harry assured her that no
less than five gentlemen in the vicinity had already
flown to Mr. Tyrold, to conjure to be accepted as
his bail: but he chose first to consult his lawyer
upon the validity of the claim made against him. All
their care, however, was ineffectual; through some
of the servants, Sir Hugh was informed of the affair,
and his affliction was despair. He accused himself as
being the cause of this evil, from the money he had
borrowed for Clermont, which might wholly have
been avoided, had he followed his brother's advice in
immediate and severe retrenchments. These, how∣ever,
he now began, in a manner that threatened to
rob him of every comfort; and Mr. Westwyn was so
much affected by his distress, that, to relieve him, at
least, from the expence of two guests and their ser∣vants,
he instantly took leave, promising nevertheless,
to yet see him again, before he returned for the rest
of his days to his native home. In a few hours after
the departure of these gentlemen, news arrived that
Mr. Tyrold was again at the rectory. Mr. Clykes
had suddenly sent his receipt, in full of all demands,
and then set off for London.</P>
<P>“There cannot be a doubt this was the deed of
the generous Mr. Westwyn, in compact with his de∣serving
S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,” continued Lavinia; “they have been
traced to Winchester; but we none of us know where,
at present, to direct to them. The delight of my Uncle
<PB N="262" REF="89"/>
at this act of his worthy old friend, has extremely re∣vived
him. My Father is much dissatisfied the wretch∣ed
Clykes should thus be paid all his fraudulent claims,
but my Mother and my Uncle would, I believe, scarce
have supported life under his longer confinement.”</P>
<P>The letter thus concluded.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“My Mother, when first she heard you were in
town, was herself going to send for you; but when
she understood that Miss Margland was with you, and
you lived in utter seclusion from company, she said;
“Since she is safe, I had rather not yet see her.”
“Our beloved Father acquiesces, for he thinks you,
at present, too much shaken, as well as herself, for so
agitating an interview, till her mind is restored to its
usual firmness. Judge then, my sister, since even he
is for the delay, if your Lavinia can gather courage
to plead against it?</P>
<P>“You know, my dearest Camilla, her extreme and
tender fondness; you cannot, therefore, doubt, but
her displeasure will soon pass away. But when, to the
dreadful pangs of finding the hapless fate of Eugenia
irremediable, was added the baneful sight of an adored
Husband in custody, you cannot wonder such compli∣cate
shocks should have disordered her frame, and
taught her,—even her, as my incomparable Father has
just said to me, “that always to be superior to cala∣mity,
demands a mental strength beyond the frail tex∣ture
of the human composition; though to wish, and
to try for it, shews we have “<HI>that within,</HI>” which
aspires at a higher state, and prepares us for fuller per∣fection.”</P>
<P>“Can I better finish my letter than with words
such as these? Adieu, then, my dear sister, I hope
soon to write more chearful tidings</P>
<P>“Our poor Mother is gone to Belfont. What a
meeting again there!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>LAVINIA TYROLD.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>A wish for death, immediate death, in common
with every youthful mourner, in the first paroxism of
violent sorrow, was the sole sensation which accom∣panied
<PB N="263" REF="90"/>
the reading, or remained after the finishing of
this letter, with Camilla. “Here,” she cried, fall∣ing
prostrate, “here might I but at once expire! close
these unworthy eyes, forbidden to raise themselves to
the authors of my existence! finish my short and cul∣pable
career, forgotten—since no longer cherished—
by the parents I have offended—by the Mother who
no longer wishes to see m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!”</P>
<P>She laid down her head, and her sight became dim;
a convulsive shivering, from feelings over-strained, and
nerves dreadfully shattered, seized her; she sighed
short and quick, and thought her prayer already ac∣complishing;
but the delusion soon ceased; she found
life still in its vigour, though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereft of its joy; and
death no nearer to her frame, for being called upon by
her wishes.</P>
<P>In the heaviness of disappointment, “I have lived,”
she cried, “too long, and yet I cannot die! I am be∣come
an alien to my family, and a burthen to myself!
ordered from my home by my Father, lest my sight
should be destructive to my Mother—whilst my sister
durst not even plead for me—O happy Edgar! how
great has been thy escape not to have taken for thy
wife this excommunicated wretch!”—</P>
<P>To live thus, seemed to her impossible; to pass
even the day in such wretchedness the believed im∣practicable.
Any, every period appeared to her pre∣ferable,
and in the desperation of her heart, she de∣termined
instantly to pursue her Mother to Belfont;
and there, by the gentle interecessi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of Eugenia, to
obtain her pardon, or, which she thought immediately
would follow its refusal, to sink to death at her feet.</P>
<P>Relieved from the intenseness of her agony by this
plan, and ever eager to pursue the first idea that arose,
she flew to borrow from Mrs. Berlinton her post∣chaise
for the next morning, and to supplicate that Miss
Margland would accompany her to Belfont; whence,
if she missed Mrs. Tyrold, they could easily return
the same day, as the distance was not more than thir∣teen
miles.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="91"/>
The chaise was accorded promptly by Mrs. Ber∣linton,
and no regret expressed at the uncertainty of
Camilla whether or not she should return; but Miss
Margland though burning with curiosity to see Eu∣genia
as Mrs. Bellamy, would not quit town, from
continual expectation, of some news of Indiana.</P>
<P>At an ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y hour the following morning, and feel∣ing
as if suspended but by a thread between life and
death, Camilla set off for Belfont.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="27" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Reverse of a Mask.</HEAD>
<P>THE plan of Camilla was to stop within twenty
yards of the house of Bellamy, and then send for
Molly Mill. But till she gave this direction to the
driver, she was not aware of the inconvenience of
being without a servant, which had not previously
occurred either to Mrs. Berlinton or herself. The
man could not leave his horses, and she was com∣pelled
to let him draw up to the gate. There, when
he rang at a bell, her terror, lest she should suddenly
encounter Mrs. Tyrold, made her bid him open the
chaise door, that she might get out and walk on,
before he enquired for Molly. But, in stepping
from the carriage, she discerned, over a paling at
some distance, Eugenia herself, alone, slowly walk∣ing,
and her head turned another way.</P>
<P>Every personal, and even every filial idea, was buried
instantly in this sight. The disastrous state of this
beloved and unhappy sister, and her own peculiar
knowledge of the worthless character of the wretch
who had betrayed her into his snares, penetrated her
with an anguish that took thought from all else;
and darting through the great gate, and thence
through a smaller one, which opened to the spot
<PB N="265" REF="92"/>
where she saw her walking, she flew to her in a
speechless transport of sorrow, folded her in her arms,
and sobbed upon her shoulder.</P>
<P>Starting, shaking, amazed, Eugenia looked at
her; “Good Heaven!” she exclaimed, “is it my
Sister!—Is it Camilla?—Do I, indeed, see one so
dear to me?” And, too weak to sustain herself, she
sunk, though not fainting, upon the turf.</P>
<P>Camilla could not articulate a syllable. The hor∣ror
she had conceived against Bellamy chilled all at∣tempt
at consolation, and her own misery which,
the preceding moment, seemed to be crushing the
springs of life, vanished in the agonized affection
with which she felt the misfortunes of her sister.</P>
<P>Eugenia soon recovered, and rising, and holding
her by the hand, yet seeming to refuse herself the emo∣tion
of returning her embraces, said, with a faint
effort to smile; “You have surprised me, indeed,
my dear Camilla, and convicted me to myself of my
vain philosophy. I had thought I should never more
be moved thus again. But I see now, the affecti∣ons
are not so speedily to be all vanquished.”</P>
<P>The melancholy conveyed by this idea of believed
apathy, in a young creature so innocent, and but
just dawning into life, still beyond speech, and nearly
beyond sufferance, affected Camilla, who hanging over
her, sighed out: “My dearest!—dearest Eu∣genia!”</P>
<P>“And what is it has brought to me this unex∣pected,
but loved sight? Does Mr. Bellamy know
you are here?”</P>
<P>“No,” she answered, shuddering at his name.</P>
<P>Eugenia looked pensive, looked distressed; and
casting down her eyes and hesitating, with a deep
sigh said: “I,—I have not the trinkets for my
dear sister—Mr. Bellamy—” she stopt.</P>
<P>Called to her sad self by this shock, of which she
strove to repress the emotion, Camilla recollected her
<PB N="266" REF="93"/>
own “almost blunted purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamlet.</NOTE>,” and fearfully asked
if their Mother were yet at Belfont.</P>
<P>“Ah, no,” she answered, clasping her hands and
leaning her head upon her sister's neck: “She is
gone!—The day before yesterday she was with me,
—with me only for one hour!—yet to pass with her
such another, I think, my dear Camilla, would soon
lead me where I might learn a better philosophy than
that I so vainly thought I had already acquired
here!”</P>
<P>Camilla, struck with awe, ventured not even at
an enquiry; and they both, for some little time,
walked on in silence.</P>
<P>“Did she name to you,” at length, in broken ac∣cents,
she asked, “did she name to you, my Euge∣nia,
—the poor, banished—Camilla?”—</P>
<P>“Banished? No. How banished?”</P>
<P>“She did not mention me?”</P>
<P>“No. She came to me but upon one subject.
She failed in her purpose,—and left me.”</P>
<P>A sigh that was nearly a groan finished this short
little speech.</P>
<P>“Ah, Heaven! my Eugenia,” cried Camilla,
now in agony unresisted, “tell me then, what pass∣ed!
what new disappointment had my unhappy Mo∣ther
to sustain? And how, and by what cruel fata∣lity,
has it fallen to your lot—even to yours—
to suffer her wishes to fail?”</P>
<P>“You know nothing, then,” said Eugenia, after
a pause, “of her view—her errand hither?”</P>
<P>“Nothing; but that to see you brought her not
only hither, but to England.”</P>
<P>“Blessed may she be!” cried Eugenia, fervently,
“and rewarded where rewards are just, and are per∣manent!”</P>
<P>Camilla zealously joined in the prayer, yet besought
to know if she might not be informed of the view
to which she alluded?</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="94"/>
“We must go then,” said Eugenia, “into the
house; my poor frame is yet feebler than my mind,
and I cannot support it unaided while I make such a
relation.”</P>
<P>Camilla, affrighted, now gave up her request; but
the generous Eugenia would not leave her in suspense.
They went, therefore, to a parlour, where, shutting
the doors and windows, she said, “I must be con∣cise,
for both our sakes; and when you understand
me, we must talk instantly of other things.”</P>
<P>Camilla could give only a tacit promise; but her
air shewed she would hold it sacred as any bond.</P>
<P>“The idea which brought over this inestimable
Parent, and which brought her, at a moment when
she knew me to be alone, to this sad house, these sad
arms—Camilla! how shall I speak it? It was to
exonerate me from my vows, as forced! to annul all
my engagements as compulsatory! and to restore me
again—O, Camilla! Camilla! to my Parents, my
Sisters, my Uncle, my dearly-loved Cleves!”</P>
<P>She gasped almost convulsively; yet though Ca∣milla
now even conjured her to say no more, went on:
“A proposal such as this, pressed upon me by one
whose probity and honour hold all calamity at
nought, if opposed to the most minute deviation
from right—a proposal such as this—ah! let me
not go back to the one terrible half instant of demur!
It was heart-rending, it was killing! I thought my∣self
again in the bosom of my loved family!”—</P>
<P>“And is it so utterly impossible? And can it not
yet be effected?”—</P>
<P>“No, my dear Sister, no! The horrible scenes I
must go through in a public trial for such a purpose
—the solemn vows I must set aside, the re-iterated
promises I must break▪—no, my dear Sister, no!
—And now, we will speak of this no more.”</P>
<P>Camilla knew too well her firmness, her enthusiasm
to perform whatever she conceived to be her duty,
to enter into any contest. Yet to see her thus self
devoted, where even her upright Mother, and pious
<PB N="268" REF="95"/>
Father, those patterns of resignation to every
heaven-inflicted sorrow, thought her ties were
repealed by the very villainy which had form∣ed
them, seemed more melancholy, and yet
harder for submission, than her first seizure by the
worthless Bellamy.</P>
<P>“And how bore my poor Mother—my
poor unfortunate Mother! destined thus to woes
of every sort, though from children who adore
her!—how bore she the deprivation of a hope that
had brought her so far?”</P>
<P>“Like herself! nobly! when once it was de∣cided,
and she saw that though, upon certain
avowals, the law might revoke my plighted faith,
it could not abrogate the scruples of my consci∣ence.
She thinks them overstrained, but she
knows them to be sincere, and permitted them,
therefore, to silence her. Unfit to be seen by any
others, she hurried then away. And then, Camilla,
began my trial! Indeed I thought, when she had
left me,—when my arms no more embraced
her honoured knees, and neither her blessings, nor
her sorrows soothed or wounded my ears, I thought
I might defy all evil to assault, all woe to afflict
me ever again! that my eyes were exhausted of
every tear, and my heart was emptied of all power
of future feeling. I seemed suddenly quite harden∣ed;—transformed
I thought to stone, as senseless,
as immoveable, and as cold!”</P>
<P>The sensations of Camilla were all such as she
durst not utter; but Eugenia, assuming some com∣posure;
added, “Of this and of me now enough—
speak, my dear Sister, of yourself. How have you
been enabled to come hither? And what could you
mean by saying you were banished?”</P>
<P>“Alas my dearest Eugenia, if my unhappy situ∣ation
is unknown to you, why should I agitate
you with new pain? my Mother, I find, spared
you; and not only you, but me—though I have
wrung her heart, tortured it by a sight never to
be obliterated from her memory—she would not
<PB N="269" REF="96"/>
rob me of my beloved sister's regard; nor even
name me, lest the altered tone of her voice should
make you say, Of what Camilla does my Mother
speak?”</P>
<P>Eugenia, with earnest wonder, begged an ex∣planation;
but when Camilla found her wholly
uninformed of the history of their Father's con∣finement,
she recoiled from giving her such a
shock: yet having gone too far entirely to recede,
she rested the displeasure of their Mother upon the
debts, and the dealings with a usurer; both suffi∣ciently
repugnant to the strictness and nobleness
of Mrs Tyrold, to seem ample justification of her
displeasure.</P>
<P>Eugenia entered into the distresses of her sister,
as if exempt herself from all suffering: and Ca∣milla,
thus commiserating and commiserated, knew
not how to tear herself away; for though Eugenia
pressed not her stay, she turned pale, when a door
opened, a clock struck, or any thing seemed to
prognosticate a separation; and looked as if to part
with her were death.</P>
<P>At length, however, the lateness of the day
forced more of resolution. But when Camilla then
rang to give orders for the carriage, the sootman
said it been gone more than two hours. The pos∣tillion,
being left without any directions, thought
it convenient to suppose he was done with; and
knowing Camilla had no authoriy, and his lady
no inclination to chide him, had given in her
little packet and driven off, without enquiry.</P>
<P>Far from repining at this mixture of imperti∣nence
and carelessness, Camilla would have rejoiced
in an accident that seemed to invite her stay, had
not her sister seemed more startled than pleased by
it. She begged, therefore, that a post chaise might
be ordered; and Molly Mill, the only servant to
whom the mistress of the house appeared willing to
speak, received the commission. At sight of Ca∣milla,
Molly had cried bitterly, and beginning
“O Miss!—” seemed entering into some lamen∣tation
<PB N="270" REF="97"/>
and detail; but Eugenia, checking her,
half whispered: “Good Molly, remember what
you promised!”</P>
<P>When Molly came back, she said that there
were no horses at Belfont, and would be none till
the next morning.</P>
<P>The sisters involuntarily congratulated one ano∣ther
upon this accident, though they reciprocated
a sigh, that to necessity alone they should owe
their lengthened intercourse.</P>
<P>“But, my dear mistress,” cried Molly, “there's
a lad that I know very well, for I always see him
when I go of an errand, that's going to Salisbury;
and he says he must go through Etherington, and
if you've any thing you want to send he'll take it
for you; and he can bring any thing back, for he
shall be here again to-morrow, for he goes post.”</P>
<P>Eugenia, sending away Molly, said, “Why
should you not seize such an opportunity to address
a few a lines to our dear mother? I may then have
the satisfaction to see her answer: and if,—as
I cannot doubt, she tells you to return home with
Miss Margland;—for she will not, I am sure, let
you travel about alone;—what a relief will it be
to me to know the distresses of my beloved sister
are terminated! I shall paint your meeting in my

of her fondness, and while away my solitary

that I have yet experienced at Belfont.”</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Could the two sisters, even in this melancholy
state, have continued together, they felt that yet
from tender sympathy, consolation might revisit
their bosoms. The day closed in; but they could
not bear to part; and though, from hour to hour,
they pronounced an adieu, they still sat on, talked
on, and found a balm in their restored intercourse,
so healing and so sweet, that the sun, though they
hailed not its beams, rose while they were yet
repeating Good Night!</P>
<P>They then thought it too late to retire, mutu∣ally
agreeing with how much greater facility they
might recover their lost rest, than an opportunity
such as this for undisturbed conversation.</P>
<P>Every minute of this endearing commerce made
separation seem harder; and the answer for which
they waited from Etherington, anxiously and fear∣fully
as it was expected, so whiled away the
minutes, that it was noon, and no chaise had
been ordered, when they heard one driving up to
the house.</P>
<P>Alarmed, they listened to know what it por∣tended.
“Mr. Bellamy,” said Eugenia, in a low
voice, “scarce ever comes home at this hour.”</P>
<P>“Can it be my Mother herself? cried Camilla.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, however, Eugenia looked pale,
“'Tis his step!” she whispered; and presently
Bellamy opened the door.</P>
<P>Obliged to acknowledge his entrance, Camilla
arose; but her parched lips and clammy mouth
made her feel as if his sight had given her a fever,
and she attempted not to force any speech.</P>
<P>He did not seem surprised at seeing her, asked
how she did, rather cavalierly than civilly: rang
<PB N="272" REF="99"/>
the bell, and gave various orders; addressed scarce
a word to his wise, and walked whistling about
the room.</P>
<P>A change so gross and quick from the obsequi∣ous
Bellamy Camilla had hitherto seen, was be∣yond
even her worst expectations, and she con∣ceived
as low an opinion of his understanding and
his manners, as of his morals.</P>
<P>Eugenia kept her eyes rivetted to the ground;
and though she tried, from time to time, to say
something to them both, evidently required her
utmost fortitude to remain in the room.</P>
<P>At length; “Miss Camilla,” he said, “I sup∣pose
you know Miss Margland is gone?”</P>
<P>“Gone? whither?—how gone?”</P>
<P>“Why home. That is to her home, as she
thinks it, Cleves. She set off this morning with
the light.”</P>
<P>Camilla, astonished, was now called forth from
her taciturnity; “What possibly,” she cried,
“can have induced this sudden journey? Has my
uncle sent for her?”</P>
<P>“No; your uncle has nothing to do with it.
She had a letter last night from Mrs. Macdersey,
with one enclosed for Sir Hugh, to beg pardon
and so forth; and this morning she set off to
carry it.”</P>
<P>Camilla was confounded. Why Miss Margland
had not, at least, called at Belfont to enquire if
she would proceed with her, was beyond all her
conjecture.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Soon after, Bellamy's servant came in with a
letter for Camilla, which had arrived after she
left town, and was given to him by Mrs. Berlin∣ton's
butler. She retired into the next room to
read it, where, to her great consternation, she
found it was from Jacob, and had been written
the day of Mr. Tyrold's arrest, though, as it was
sent by a private hand, it had only now arrived.
“Things going,” he said, “so bad at Cleves, on
“account of so many misfortunes, his master was
<PB N="273" REF="100"/>
denying himself all his natural comforts, and in
particular he had sent to un-order a new pipe of
Madeira, saying he would go without; though,
as Miss might remember, it was the very wine
the doctors had ordered for his stomach. This
all the servants had taken so to heart, that they
had resolved to buy it among 'em, and get it
privately laid in, and not let his honour know
but what it was always the same, till till he had
drunk so much he could not help himself. For
this, they were to join, according to their
wages or savings; Now I,” says Jacob, “being,

</LETTER>
<P>So touching a mark of the fond gratitude of the
Cleves' servants to their kind master, mingled
tenderness, in defiance of all horror, in the tears
of Camilla; but her total inability to satisfy the
just claims of Jacob, since now her resource even
in Eugenia failed, with the grief of either defeating
his worthy project, or making it lastingly hurtful
to him, was amongst the severest strokes which had
followed her ill advised schemes. To proclaim
such an additional debt, was a shame from which
she shrunk; yet to fly immediately to Cleves, and
try to soothe her oppressed uncle, was an idea that
still seemed gifted with some power to soothe her∣self.
Whither indeed else could she now go? she
had no longer either carriage or protectress in
town; and what she gathered of the re-admission
<PB N="274" REF="101"/>
of Bellamy to Grosvenor-square, made the cautions
and opinions of Edgar burst forcibly upon her
mind, to impede, though most mournfully, all
future return to Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>A pliancy so weak, or so wilful, seemed to
announce in that lady an almost determined incor∣rigibility
in wrong, however it might be checked,
in its progress, by a mingled love of right, and
a fear of ill consequences.</P>
<P>“Ah Edgar!” she cried, “had I trusted you as
I ought, from the moment of your generous de∣claration
—had my confidence been as firm in your
kindness as in your honour, what misery had I
been saved!—from this connection—from my
debts—from every wide-spreading mischief!—I
could then have erred no more, for I should have
thought but of your approvance!”</P>
<P>These regrets were, as usual, resuming their
absorbing powers;—for all other evils seemed fluc∣tuating,
but here misery was stationary; when the
voice of Bellamy, speaking harshly to his unhappy
wife, and some words she unavoidably caught, by
which she found he was requesting that she would
demand money of Sir Hugh, made her conclude
him not aware he was overheard, and force her∣self
back to the parlour. But his inattention upon
her return was so near rudeness, that she soon felt
convinced Mrs. Berlinton had acquainted him with
her remonstrances and ill opinion: he seemed in
guilty fear of letting her converse even a moment
with Eugenia; and presently, though with an air
of pretended unconcern, said: “You have no
commands for the chaise I came in, Miss Camilla?”</P>
<P>“No, Sir,—What chaise?—Why?—”
She stammered.</P>
<P>“It's difficult sometimes to get one at this
place; and these horses are very fresh. I bid them
stay till they asked you.”</P>
<P>This was so palpable a hint for her to depart,
that she could but not answer she would make use
of it, when she had taken leave of her sister;
<PB N="275" REF="102"/>
whom she now looked at with emotions near
despair at her fate, and with difficulty restrained
even its most unbridled expressions. But Bellamy
kept close, and no private conference could take
place. Eugenia merely said: “Which way, my
dear sister, shall you go?”</P>
<P>“I—I am not, fixed—to—to Cleves, I
believe,” answered she, scarce knowing herself
what she said.</P>
<P>“I am very glad of it,” she replied, “for the
sake of my poor—” she found her voice faulter,
and did not pronounce “uncle;” but added, “as
Miss Margland has already left London, I think
you right to go thither at once; it may abridge
many difficulties; and with post-horses, you may
be there before it is dark.”</P>
<P>They then embraced tenderly, but parted with∣out
any further speech, and she set off rather me∣chanically
than designedly for Cleves.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A new View of an old Mansion.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA, for some time, bestowed no thought
upon what she was doing, nor whither she was going.
A scene so dreadful as that she now quitted, and a
character of such utter unworthiness as that with
which her sister for life was tied, absorbed her sacul∣ties,
and nearly broke her heart.</P>
<P>When she stopt, however, at Bagshot, for fresh
horses, the obligation of giving directions to others,
made her think of herself; and, bewildered with un∣certainty
whether the step she took were right or
wrong, she regretted she had not, at least, desired to
stay till the answer arrived from Etherington. Yet
her journey had the sanction of Eugenia's concur∣rence;
and Eugenia seemed to her oracular.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="103"/>
When she came upon the cross road leading from
Winchester to Cleves, and felt her quick approach to
the spot so loved yet dreaded, the horses seemed to
her to fly. Twenty times she called out to the driver
not to hurry; who as often assured her the bad roads
prevented any haste; she wanted to form some appro∣priate
plan and speech for every emergence; but she
could suggest none for any. She was now at the feet
of her Mother, now kissing the hands of her Father,
now embraced again by her fond uncle;—and now
rejected by them all. But while her fancy was at
work alternately to soothe and to torture her, the park
lodge met her eyes, with still no resolution taken.</P>
<P>Vehemently she stopt the chaise. To drive in
through the park would call a general attention, and
she wished, ere her arrival were announced, to con∣sult
alone with Lavinia. She resolved, therefore, to
get out of the carriage, and run by a private path, to
a small door at the back of the house, whence she
could glide to the chamber commonly appropriated to
her sister.</P>
<P>She told the postilion to wait, and alighting, walk∣ed
quick and fearfully towards the lodge.</P>
<P>She passed through the park-gate for foot-passengers
without notice from the porter. It was twilight. She
saw no one; and rejoiced in the general vacancy.
Trembling, but with celerity, she “<HI>skimmed,</HI>” like
her celebrated name-sake, the turf; and annoyed only
by the shadows of the trees, which all, as first they
caught her eye, seemed the precursors of the approach
of Mrs. Tyrold, speedily reached the mansion: but
when she came to the little door by which she meant
to enter, she found it fastened.</P>
<P>To the front door she durst not go, from the nu∣merous
chances by which she might surprise some of
the family in the hall: and to present herself at the
servant's gate would have an appearance degrading
and clandestine.</P>
<P>She recollected, at last, the sash-door of a bow-window
belonging to a room that was never occupied
but in summer. Thither she went, and knowing the
<PB N="277" REF="104"/>
spring by which it could be opened on the out-side,
let herself into the house.</P>
<P>With steps not to be heard, and scarce breathing,
she got thence into a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong stone passage, whence she
meant to mount the back stairs.</P>
<P>She was relieved by not meeting any one in the way,
though surprised to hear no foot-steps about the house,
and no voices from any of the apartments.</P>
<P>Cautiously she went on, looking round at every
step, to avoid any sudden encounter; but when she
came to the bed-chamber gallery, she saw that the door
of the room of Sir Hugh, by which she must neces∣sarily
pass, was wide open.</P>
<P>It was possible he might be in it: she had not cou∣rage
to pass; her sight, thus unprepared, after so
many heavy evils, might be too affecting for his weak
frame. She turned short round, and entered a large
apartment at the head of the stairs, called the
billiard-room, where she resolved to wait and watch
ere she ventured any further.</P>
<P>Its aspect was to the front of the house: she stole
gently to a window, whence she thought the melan∣choly
of her own mind pervaded the park. None of
her uncle's horses were in sight; no one was passing
to and fro; and she looked vainly even for the house∣dog
who ordinarily patrolled before the mansion.</P>
<P>She ventured to bend forwarder, to take a view of
the side wings; these, however, presented not any
sight more exhilirating nor more animated. Nothing
was in motion, no one was visible, not even a fire
blazed chearfulness.</P>
<P>She next strove to catch a glance of the windows
belonging to the chamber of Eugenia; but her sigh,
though sad, was without surprise to see their shutters
closed. Those of Indiana were shut also. “How
mournfully,” cried she, “is all changed! what of
virtues are gone with Eugenia! what of beauty with
Indiana! the one so constantly interesting! the other
locking always so lovely!”</P>
<P>But deeper still was her sigh, since mingled with
self-reproach, to perceive her own chamber also shut
<PB N="278" REF="105"/>
up. “Alas!” she cried, “my poor uncle considers
us all as dead to him!” She durst not lean sufficiently
forward to examine the drawing-room, in which she
concluded the family assembled; but she observed,
with wonder, that even the library was not open,
though it was still too light for candles; and Dr.
Orkborne, who usually sat there, from the forgetful∣ness
of application, was the last to demand them.</P>
<P>The fear of discovery was now combated by an
anxiety to see some one—any one,—and she returned
to the passage. All there was still quiet, and she
hazarded gliding past the open door, though without
daring to look into the room; but when she came to
the chamber of Lavinia, which she softly entered, all
was dark, and it was evidently not in present use.</P>
<P>This was truly distressful. She concluded her
sister was returned to Etherington, and knew not to
whom to apply for counsel or mediation. She no
longer, however, feared meeting her parents, who
certainly had not made her sister quit Cleves without
themselves; and, after a little hesitation, relying
upon the ever sure lenity of her uncle, she determin∣ed
to cast herself upon his kindness: but first to send
in a short note, to avoid giving him any surprise.</P>
<P>She returned down the gallery, meaning to apply
for pen and ink to the first person she could find: she
could only, she knew, meet with a friend; unless,
by ill fortune, she should encounter Miss Margland, the
way to whose apartment she sedulously shunned.</P>
<P>No longer, however, quite so cautious, she stopt
near the chamber of Sir Hugh, and convinced by the
stillness it was empty, could not resist stepping into
the apartment.</P>
<P>It looked despoiled and forsaken. Nothing was in
its wonted order; his favourite guns hung not over the
chimney-piece; the corners of the room were emptied
of his sticks; his great chair was in a new place; no
cushions for his dogs were near the fire; the bedstead
was naked.</P>
<P>She now felt petrified; she sunk on the floor, to
ejaculate a prayer for his safety; but knew not how to
<PB N="279" REF="106"/>
rise again, for terror; nor which way next to turn,
nor what even to conjecture.</P>
<P>Thus she remained, till suspense grew worse than
certainty, and forced herself from the room to seek
some explanation. It was possible the whole family
residence might be changed to the back front of the
house. She defcended the stairs with almost equal ap∣prehension
of meeting any one or seeing no one. The
stone passage was now nearly dark. It was always
the first part of the house that was lighted, as its
windows were small and high: but no preparations
were now making for that purpose. She went to the
house-keeper's room, which was at the foot of the
stairs she had descended. The door was shut, and
she could not open it. She tried repeatedly, but
vainly, to be heard by soft taps and whisperings; no
one answered.</P>
<P>Amazed, confounded, she turned slowly another
way; not a foul was in sight, not a sound within
hearing. Every thing looked desolate, all the family
seemed to be vanished.</P>
<P>Insensibly, yet irresistibly, she now moved on to∣wards
the drawing-room. The door was shut. She
hesitated whether or not to attempt it. She listened.
She hoped to catch the voice of her uncle: but all
was inviolably still.</P>
<P>This was the only place of assembling in the eve∣ning;
but her uncle might have dropt asleep, and
she would not hazard startling him with her presence.
She would sooner go to the hall at once, and be an∣nounced
in the common way by a servant.</P>
<P>But what was her astonishment in coming to the
hall, to find neither servant, light nor fire? and the
marble pavement covered with trunks, packing mats,
straw, ropes, and boxes? Terrified and astonished,
she thought herself walking in her sleep. She could
combine no ideas, either good or bad, to account for
such a scene, and she looked at it bewildered and
incredulous.</P>
<P>After a long hesitation, spent in wonder rather than
thought, she at length determined to enter the break∣fast
<PB N="280" REF="107"/>
parlour, and ring the bell: when the distant
sound of a carriage that was just entering the park,
made her shut herself into the room, hastily, but
silently.</P>
<P>It advanced rapidly; she trembled; it was surely,
she thought, her Mother.</P>
<P>When it drove up to the portico, and she heard the
house-bell ring, she instinctively barred her door; but
finding no one approach to the call, while the bell was
impatiently re-rung, her strong emotions of expecta∣tion
were taking her again into the hall: but as her
hand was upon the lock of the door, a light glimmer∣ed
through the key hole. She heard some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ep ad∣vancing,
and precipitately drew back.</P>
<P>The hall-door was now opened, and a man en∣quired
for a young lady just come from Alresford.</P>
<P>“There's no young lady here at all,” was the an∣swer,
in the voice of Jacob.</P>
<P>Finding it only her own driver, she ventured out;
crying “O Jacob! where is my dear uncle?”</P>
<P>Jacob was, at first, incapable of all answer, through
surprise at her strange appearance; but then said, “O
Miss Camilla! you'll go nigh to break your good
heart when you knows it all! But how, you've got
into the house is what I can't guess; but I wish, for
my poor master's sake, it had been before now!”</P>
<P>Horror crept through every vein of Camilla, in the
explanation she awaited of this fearful mystery. She
motioned to the driver to stay, returned back to the
parlour, and beckoned, for she could not speak, to
Jacob to follow her.</P>
<P>When he came, and, shutting the door, was be∣ginning
a diffuse lamentation, eagerness to avert
lengthened suspence recovered her voice, and sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pas∣sionately
exclaimed: “Jacob! in two words, where
is my uncle?—Is he well?”</P>
<P>“Why, yes, Miss Camilla, considering—” he
began; but Camilla, whose fears had been fatal, in∣terrupted
him with f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rvent thanksgiving, till she was
called back from joy by the following words:</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="108"/>
“He's gone away Miss Camilla! gone Lord
knows where! given up all his grand house-keep∣ing,
turned off almost all his poor servants, left
this fine place, to have it let to whoever will hire
it, and is going to live, he says, in some poor little
lodging, till he can scrape together wherewithal to
pay off every thing for your papa.”</P>
<P>A thunder-bolt that had instantly destroyed her,
would gratefully have been received, in preference
to this speech, by Camilla, who, casting up her
hands and eyes, exclaimed: “Then am I the most
detestable, as well as the most wretched of human
beings! My Father I have imprisoned!—my Un∣cle
I have turned from his house and home! and
for thee, O my Mother!—this is the reception I
have prepared!”</P>
<P>Jacob tried to console her; but his account was
only added torture.</P>
<P>The very instant he told her, that his master
had received the news of the arrest of Mr. Tyrold,
he determined upon this violent plan; and though
the so speedy release, through the generosity of
Mr. Westwyn, had exceedingly calmed his first
emotions, he would not change his purpose, and
protested he would never indulge himself in peace
nor comfort more, till he had cleared off their
joint debts; of which he attributed the whole fault
to himself, from having lived up to the very verge
of his yearly income, when he ought, he said, con∣sidering
there were so many young people, to have
always kept a few odd sums at hand for accidents.
“We all did what we could,” continued Jacob,
“to put him off from such a thing, but all to no
purpose; but if you'd been here, Miss Camilla,
you'd have done more with him than all of us put
together: but he called Miss Lavinia and all of us
up to him, and said to us, I won't have nobody tell
this to my poor little girl, meaning you, Miss Ca∣milla,
till l've got somewhere settled and comfort∣able;
because of her kind heart, says he.”</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="109"/>
Tenderness so partial, at so suffering an instant,
almost killed Camilla, “O Jacob,” she cried,
“where is now my dear generous uncle? I will
follow him in this chaise (rushing out as she spoke)
I will be his servant, his nurse, and attend him
from morning to night!”</P>
<P>She hurried into the carriage as she spoke; and
bade him give directions to the postilion. But
when she heard he was, at present, only at Ether∣ington,
whence he was seeking a new abode, her
head drooped, and she burst into tears.</P>
<P>Jacob remained, he said, alone, to take care
of all the things▪ and to shew the place to such as
might come.</P>
<P>Miss Margland had been at the house about
three hours ago; and had met Sir Hugh, who had
come over, to give directions about what he would
have packed up; and he had read a letter from
Miss Indy that was, and had forgiven her; but he
was sore vexed Miss Margland had come without
Miss Camilla; only she said Miss Camilla was at
Mrs. Bellamy's, and she did not call, because she
thought it would be better to go back again, and
see more about Miss Indy, and so bring Miss Ca∣milla
next time; so she wheedled his master to
spare the chaise again, and let her go off directly
to settle every thing to Miss Indy's mind.</P>
<P>Camilla now repented she had not returned to
Mrs. Berlinton's, there, notwithstanding all ob∣jections,
to have waited her recall; since there her
parents still believed her, and thence, under the
protection of Miss Margland, would in all proba∣bility
summon her. To present herself, after this
barbarous aggravation of the calamities she had
caused, undemanded and unforgiven at Ethering∣ton,
she thought impossible. She inquired if, by
passing the night, at Cleves, she might have any
chance of seeing her uncle the next day. Jacob
answered, no; but that Mr. Tyrold himself, with
a gentleman from Winchester, who thought of
<PB N="283" REF="110"/>
hiring the house, were to be there early in the
morning to take a survey of the premises.</P>
<P>A meeting, thus circumstanced, with her Fa∣ther,
at a moment when he came upon so direful a
business, as parting with a place of which she had
herself occasioned the desertion, seemed to her in∣supportable:
and she resolved to return immedi∣ately
to Belfont, to see there if her answer from
Lavinia contained any new directions; and if not,
to again go to London, and await final commands;
without listening ever more to any hopes, projects,
or judgments of her own.</P>
<P>Beseeching the worthy Jacob to pardon her non∣payment,
with every kind assurance that her uncle
should know all his goodness, she told the postillion
to take her to Belfont.</P>
<P>He could go no further, he said, and that but a
foot pace, than to Alresford. Jacob marvelled,
but blessed her, and Camilla, ejaculating, “Adieu,
dear happy Cleves!” was driven out of the park.</P>

<P>TO leave thus a spot where she had experienced
such felicity; to see it naked and forlorn, despoil∣ed

to have re-entered its pales, and in terror to

<P>Fearfully she asked who was at home; and hear∣ing
only their mistress, sent for Molly Mill, and
enquired for the answer from Etherington; but
the lad had not yet brought any. She begged her
to run to the inn, to know what had detained him;
and then, ordering the chaise to wait, went to her
sister.</P>
<P>Eugenia was gently rejoiced to see her, though
evidently with encreased personal unhappiness.
Camilla would fain have spared her the history of
the desertion of Cleves; but it was an act that in
its own nature must be public; and she had no other
way to account for her so speedy return.</P>
<P>Eugenia heard it with the most piercing affliction;
and, in the fulness of her heart, from the new blow,
acknowledged the rapacity of Bellamy, and the bar∣barity
with which he now scrupled not to avow
the sordid motives of his marriage; cruelly la∣menting
the extreme simplicity with which she had
been beguiled into a belief of the sincerity and
violence of his attachment. “For myself, how∣ever,”
she continued, “I now cease to murmur.
How can misfortune, personally, cut me deeper?
But with pity, indeed, I think of a new victim!”</P>
<P>She then put into her sister's hand a written
paper she had picked up the preceding evening in
<PB N="285" REF="112"/>
her room, and which, having no direction, and
being in the hand-writing of Mrs. Berlinton, she
had thought was a former note to herself, acciden∣tally
dropt: but the first line undeceived her.</P>
<P>“I yield, at length, O Bellamy, to the eloquence
of your friendship! on Friday,—at one o'clock,
I will be there—as you appoint.”</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Camilla, almost petrified, read the lines. She
knew better than her sister the plan to which this
was the consent; which to have been given after
her representations and urgency, appeared so ut∣terly
unjustifiable, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat, with equal grief and in∣dignation,
she gave up this unhappy friend as wil∣fully
lost; and her whole heart recoiled from ever
again entering her doors</P>
<P>Retracing, nevertheless, her many amiable qua∣lities,
she knew not how, without further effort, to
leave her to her threatening fate; and determined,
at all risks, to put her into the hands of her bro∣ther,
whose timely knowledge of her danger might
rescue her from public exposure. She wrote
therefore the following note:</P>
<P>“<HI>To</HI> FREDERICK MELMOND, <HI>Esq.</HI>
Watch and save,—or you will lose your sister.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>C. T.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>His address, from frequently hearing it, was
familiar to her; she went herself into the hall, to
give the billet to a footman for the post-office.
She would not let her sister have any share in the
transaction, lest it should afterwards, by any acci∣dent,
be known; though, to give force to her
warning, she risked without hesitation the initials
of her own name.</P>
<P>The repugnance, nevertheless, to going again to
Mrs. Berlinton, pointed out no new refuge; and
she waited, with added impatience, for the answer
from Etherington, in hopes some positive direction
might relieve her cruel perplexity.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="113"/>
The answer, however, came not, and yet great∣er
grew her distress. Molly Mill brought word
that when the messenger, who was a post-boy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>turned, he was immediately employed to driv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
chaise to London. The people at the inn heard
him say something of wanting to go to 'Squire
Bellamy's with a letter; but he had not time. He
was to come back however at night.</P>
<P>To wait till he arrived seemed now to them both
indispensable; but while considering at what hour
to order the chaise, they heard a horseman gallop
up to the house-door. “Is it possible it should
already be Mr. Bellamy?” cried Eugenia changing
colour.</P>
<P>His voice, loud and angry, presently confirmed
the suggestion. Eugenia, trembling, said she would
let him know whom he would find; and went into
the next room, where, as he entered, he roughly
exclaimed, “What have you done with what I
dropt out of my pocket-book?”</P>
<P>“There, Sir,” she answered, in the tone of firm∣ness
given by the ascendance of innocence over
guilt, “There it is: but how you can reconcile
to yourself the delusions by which you must have
obtained it I know not. I hope only, for her
sake, and for yours, such words will never more
meet my eyes.”</P>
<P>He was beginning a violent answer in a raised
voice, when Eugenia told him her sister was in
the next room.</P>
<P>He then, in a lowered tone, said, “I warrant,
you have shewn her my letter?”</P>
<P>The veracious Eugenia was incapable of saying
no; and Bellamy, unable to restrain his rage,
though smothering his voice, through his shut
teeth, said, “I shall remember this, I promise you!”
However, if she dare ever speak of it, you may
tell her, from me, I shall lock you up upon bread
and water for the rest of your life, and lay it at her
door. I have no great terms to keep with her
now. What does she say about Cleves? and that
<PB N="287" REF="114"/>
fool your uncle, who is giving up his house to
pay your father's debts? What has brought her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again?”</P>
<P>▪She is returning to Grosvenor square, to Miss
Margland.”</P>
<P>“Miss Margland? There's no Miss Margland
in Grosvenor-square; nor any body else, that
desires her company I can tell her. However, go,
and get her off, for I have other business for you.”</P>
<P>“Eugenia then, opening the door, found her
sister almost demolished with terror and dismay.
Silently, for some seconds, they sunk on the breast
of each other; horror closing all speech, drying
up even their tears.</P>
<P>“You have no message to give me!” Camilla
at length whispered; “I have perforce, heard all!
and I will go;—though whither—”</P>
<P>She stopt, with a look of distress so poignant,
that Eugenia, bursting into tears, while tenderly
she clung around her, said, “My sister! my Ca∣milla!
from me—from my house must you wander
in search of an asylum!”</P>
<P>Bellamy here called her back. Camilla entreat∣ed
she would inquire if he knew whither Miss
Margland was gone.</P>
<P>He now came in himself, bowing civilly, though
with constraint, and told her that Miss Margland
was with Mrs. Macdersey, at Macdersey's own
lodgings; but that neither of them would any
more be invited to Grosvenor-square, after such
ill-treatment of Mrs. Berlinton's brother.</P>
<P>Can you, thought Camilla, talk of ill-treatment?
while, turning to her sister, she said, “Which
way shall I now travel?”</P>
<P>Bellamy abruptly asked, if she was forced to go
before dinner; but not with an air of inviting any
answer.</P>
<P>None could she make; she looked down, to save
her eyes the sight of an object they abhorred, em∣braced
Eugenia, who seemed a picture of death;
and after saying adieu, added, “If I knew whither
<PB N="288" REF="115"/>
you thought I should go—that should be my
guide?”</P>
<P>“Home, my dearest sister!”</P>
<P>“Drive then,” she cried, hurrying to the chaise,
“to Etherington.”</P>
<P>Bellamy advancing, said, with a smile, “I see
you are not much used to travelling. Miss Camilla!”
and gave the man a direction to Bagshot.</P>
<P>She began, now, to feel nearly careless what
became of her; her situation seemed equally deso∣late
and disgraceful, and in gloomy despondence,
when she turned from the high road, and stopt at
a small inn, called the half-way-house, about nine
miles from Etherington, she resolved to remain
there till she received her expected answer; ardently
hoping, if it were not yielding and favourable,
the spot upon which she should read it, would be
that upon which her existence would close.</P>
<P>Alighting at the inn, which, from being upon
a cross road, had little custom, and was scarce
more than a large cottage, she entered a small par∣lour,
discharged her chaise, and ordered a man
and horse to go immediately to Belfont.</P>
<P>Presently two or three gentle tappings at the
door made her, though fearfully, say, “Come in!”
A little girl then, with incessant low courtesies,
appeared, and looking smilingly in her face, said,
“Pray, ma'am a'n't you the Lady that was so
good to us?”</P>
<P>“When? my dear? what do you mean?”</P>
<P>“Why, that used to give us cakes and nice
things, and gave 'em to Jen, and Bet, and Jack? and
that would not let my dad be took up?”</P>
<P>Camilla now recollected the eldest little Higden,
the washerwoman's niece, and kindly enquired
after her father, her aunt, and family.</P>
<P>“O, they all does pure now. My dad's had no
more mishaps, and he hopes, please God, to get
on pretty well.”</P>
<P>“Sweet hearing!” cried Camilla, “all my pur∣poses
have not, then, been frustrated!”</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="116"/>
With added satisfaction she learned also that the
little girl had a good place, and a kind mistress.
She begged her to hasten the Belfont messenger, giving
her in charge a short note for Eugenia, with a request
for the Etherington letter. She had spent nothing in
London, save in some small remembrances to one or
two of Mrs. Berlinton's servants; and though her
chaise-hire had now almost emptied her purse, she
thought every expence preferable to either lengthening
her suspence, or her residence on the road.</P>
<P>In answer to the demand of what she would be
pleased to have, she then ordered tea. She had taken
no regular meal for two days; and for two nights had
not even been in bed. But the wretchedness of her
mind seemed to render her invulnerable to fatigue.</P>
<P>The shaken state of her nerves warped all just con∣sideration
of the impropriety of her present sojourn.
Her judgment had no chance, where it had her feelings
to combat, and in the despondence of believing her∣self
parentally rejected, she was indifferent to appear∣ances,
and desperate upon all other events; nor was
she brought to any recollection, till she was informed
that the messenger, whom she had concluded was half
way to Belfont, could not set out till the next morn∣ing:
this small and private inn not being able to fur∣nisn
a man and horse at shorter warning.</P>
<P>To pass a second night at an inn, seemed, even in
the calculations of her own harassed faculties, utterly
improper; and thus, driven to extremity, she forced
herself to order a chaise for home; though with a
repugnance to so compulsatory a meeting, that made
her wish to be carried in it a corpse.</P>
<P>The tardy prudence of the character naturally rash,
commonly arrives but to point repentance that it came
not before. The only pair of horses the little inn
afforded, were now out upon other duty, and would
not return till the next day.</P>
<P>Almost to herself incredible seemed now her situ∣ation.
She was compelled to order a bed, and to go
up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tairs to a small chamber: but she could not even
wish to take any rest. “I am an outcast,” she cried,
<PB N="290" REF="117"/>
“to my family;” my Mother would <HI>rather not see<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me;</HI>
my Father forbears to demand me; and he—dearer to
me than life!—by whom I was once chosen, has for∣gotten
me!—How may I support my heavy existence?
and when will it end?</P>
<P>Overpowered, nevertheless, by fatigue, in the
middle of the night, she lay down in her cloaths:
but her slumbers were so broken by visions of reproach,
conveyed through hideous forms, and in menaces the
most terrific, that she gladly got up; preferring certain
affliction to wild and santastic horrors.</P>
<P>Nearly as soon as it was light, she rang for little
Peggy, whose Southampton anecdotes had secured her
the utmost respect from the mistress of the inn, and
heard that the express was set off.</P>
<P>Dreadful and dreary, in slow and lingering misery,
passed the long interval of his absence,\though his
rapid manner of travelling made it short for the
ground he traversed. She had now, however, bought
sufficient experience to bespeak a chaise against his
return. The only employment in which she could
engage herself, was conversing with Peggy Higden,
who, she was glad to find, could not remember her
name well enough to make it known, through her
pronunciation.</P>
<P>From the window, at length, she perceived a man
and horse gallop up to the house. She darted forth,
exclaiming: “Have you brought me any answer?”
And seizing the letter he held out, saw the hand∣writing
of Lavinia, and shut herself into her room.</P>
<P>She opened it upon her knees, expecting to find
within some lines from her mother; none, however,
appeared, and sad and mortified, she laid down the
letter, and wept. “So utterly, then,” she cried,
“have I lost her? Even with her pen will she not
speak to me? How early is my life too long!”</P>
<P>Taking up again, then, the letter, she read what
follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“<HI>To Miss</HI> CAMILLA TYROLD.”</OPENER>
<P>Alas, my dear sister, why can I not answer you
according to our mutual wishes? My Father is at
<PB N="291" REF="118"/>
Winchester, with a lawyer, upon the affairs of Indi∣ana;
and my mother is abroad with my uncle, upon
business which he has asked her to transact; but even
were she here—could I, while the man waits, inter∣cede?
have you forgotten your ever fearful Lavinia?
All that she dares, shall be done,—but that you may
neither think she has been hitherto neglectful, nor let
your hopes expect too much speed from her future
efforts, I am painfully reduced to own to you, what
already has passed. But let it not depress you; you
know when she is hurt, it is not lightly: but you
know, also, where she loves, her displeasure, once
passed, is never allowed to rise again.</P>
<P>“Yesterday I saw her looking at your picture;” the
moment seemed to be happy, and I ventured to say;
“Ah, poor Camilla!” but she turned to me with
qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kness, and cried; Lament rather, Lavinia, your
Father! Did he merit so little trust from his child,
that her affairs should be withheld from him till they
cast him—where I found him!—Dread, memorable
sight!—when may I forget it!</P>
<P>“Even after this,” my dear Camilla, I hazarded
another word, “she will be miscrable, I said, my
dear Mother, till she returns.” “She will return,”
she answered, with Miss Margland. This is no season
for any expence that may be avoided; and Camilla,
most of all, must now see the duties of oeconomy.
Were her understanding less good, I should less hea∣vily
weigh her errors; but she sets it apart, to aban∣don
herself to her feelings. Alas! poor thing! they
will now themselves be her punishers! Let her not
however despond; tell her, when you write, her
angelic Father forgives her; and tell her she has
always had my prayers, and will ever have my bles∣sing;—
though I am not eager, as yet, to add to her
own reproach<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, those she may experience from my
presence.</P>
<P>I know not how to introduce this to my dearest
Camilla, but your messenger, and his haste, now
forces me to say all, and say it quick. He brings, I
find, the letter from Belfont, where already we had
<PB N="292" REF="119"/>
heard you were removed through Miss Margland,
much to the approbation of my Father and my Mother,
who hope your sojourn there is a solace to you both.
Adieu, my dearest sister—your messenger cannot
wait.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>“LAVINIA TYROLD.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>“She will not see me then!” cried Camilla, “she
cannot bear my sight! O Death! let me not pray to
thee also in vain!”</P>
<P>Weak from inanition, confused from want of sleep,
harassed with fatigue, and exhausted by perturbarion,
she felt now so ill, that she solemnly believed her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atal
wish quick approaching.</P>
<P>The landlord of the inn entered to say that the
chaise she had ordered was at the door; and put down
upon the table the bill of what she had to pay.</P>
<P>Whither to turn, what course to take, she knew
not; though to remain longer at an inn, while per∣suaded
life was on its wane, was dreadful; yet how
present herself at home, after the letter she had
received? what asylum was any where open to her?</P>
<P>She begged the landlord to wait, and again read the
letter of Lavinia, when, startled by what was said
of abandoning herself to her feelings, she saw that
her immediate duty was to state her situation to her
parents. She desired, therefore, the chaise might be
put up, and wrote these l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“I could not,” unhappily, stay at Eugenia's; nor
can I return to Mrs. Berlinton; I am now at the half∣way
house where I shall wait for commands. My
Lavinia will tell me what I may be ordered to do.
I am ill,—and earnestly I pray with an illness from
which I may rise no more. When my Father—my
Mother, hear this, they will perhaps accord me to be
blest again with their sight; the brevity of my career
may, to their kindness, expiate its faults; they may
pray for me where my own prayers may be too un∣sanctified
to be heard; they may forgive me—though
my own forgiveness never more will quiet this breast!
<PB N="293" REF="120"/>
Heaven bless and preserve them; their unoffending
daughters; and my ever loved uncle!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>“CAMILLA TYROLD.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>She then rang the bell, and desired this note
might go by express to Etherington.</P>
<P>But this, the waiter answered, was impossible;
the horse on which the messenger had set out to
Belfont, though it had only carried him the first
stage, and brought him back the last, had galloped
so hard, that his master would not send it out again
the same day; and they had but that one.</P>
<P>She begged he would see instantly for some other
conveyance.</P>
<P>The man who was come back from Belfont, he
answered, would be glad to be discharged, as he
wanted to go to rest.</P>
<P>She then took up the bill, and upon examining
the sum total, found, with the express, the chaise
in which she came the last stage, that which she
ordered to take her to Etherington, and the ex∣pence
of her residence, it amounted to half a crown
beyond what she possessed.</P>
<P>She had only, she knew, to make herself known
as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iece of Sir Hugh Tyrold, to be trusted by
all the environs; but to expose herself in this help∣less,
and even pennyless state, appeared to her to
be a degradation to every part of her family.</P>
<P>To enclose the bill to Etherington was to secure
its being paid; but the sentence, <HI>Camilla most of all
must now see the duties of oeconomy,</HI> made her revolt
from such a step.</P>
<P>All she still possessed of pecuniary value she had
in her pocket: the seal of her Father, the ring of
her Mother, the watch of her Uncle, and the locket
of Edgar landlebert. With one of these she now
determined to part, in preference to any new ex∣posure
at Eth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rington, or to incurring the small∣est
debt. She desired to be left alone, and took
them from her pocket, one by one, painfully rumi∣nating
upon which she could bear to lose. “It
<PB N="294" REF="121"/>
may not,” she thought, be for long; for quick, I
hope, my course will end!—yet even for an hour,
—even for the last final moment—to give up such
dear symbols of all that has made my happiness in
life!—</P>
<P>She looked at them, kissed and pressed them to
her heart; spoke to them as if living and under∣standing
representatives of their donors, and be∣stowed
so much time in lamenting caresses and he∣sitation,
that the waiter came again, while yet she
was undetermined.</P>
<P>She desired to speak to the mistress of the house.</P>
<P>Instinctively she now put away the gifts of her
parents; but between her uncle and Edgar she
wavered. She blushed, however, at her demur,
and the modesty of duty made her put up the
watch. Taking, then, and agitating last view of
a locket which circumstances had rendered inap∣preciable
to her, “Ah! not in vain,” she cried,
“even now shall I lose what once was a token so
bewitching—Dear precious locket! Edgar even
yet would be happy you should do me one last kind
office! generously, benevolently, he would rejoice
you should spare me still one last menacing
shame!”—</P>
<P>When Mrs. Marl, the landlady, came in, deeply
colouring, she put it into her hand, turning her
eyes another way, while she said; “Mrs. Marl, I
have not quite money enough to pay the bill; but
if you will keep this locket for a security, you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
be sure to be paid by and bye.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Marl looked at it with great admiration,
and then, with yet greater wonder, at Camilla.
“'Tis pretty, indeed, ma'am,” she said; “'twould
be pity to sell it. However, I'll shew it my hus∣band.”</P>
<P>Mr. Marl soon came himself, with looks some∣what
less satisfied, “Tis a fine bauble, ma'am,”
cried he, “but I don't understand those things;
and there's nobody here can tell me what it's worth.
I'd rather have my money, if you please.”</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="122"/>
Weakened now in body, as well as spirits, she
burst into tears. Alas! she thought, how little do
my friends conjecture to what I am reduced! She
offered, however, the watch, and the countenance
of Mr. Marl lost its gloom.</P>
<P>“This,” said he, “is something like! A gold
watch one may be sure to get one's own for; but
such a thing as that mayn't fetch sixpence, fine as
it looks.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Marl objected to keeping both; but her
husband said he saw no harm in it; and Camilla
begged her note might be sent without delay.</P>
<P>A labourer, after some search, was found, who
undertook, for handsome pay, to carry it on foot
to the rectory.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Spectacle.</HEAD>
<P>THE messenger returned not till midnight;
what, then, was the consternation of Camilla that
he brought no answer! She suspected he had not
found the house; she doubted if the letter had been
delivered; but he affirmed he had put it into the
hands of a maid-servant, though, as it was late, he
had come away directly, and not thought of wait∣ing
for any answer.</P>
<P>It is not very early in life we learn how little is
performed, for which no precaution is taken.
Care is the offspring of disappointment; and sorrow
and repentance commonly hang upon its first les∣sons.
Unused to transact any sort of business for
herself, she had expected, in sending a letter an
answer as a thing of course, and had now only
herself to blame for not having ordered him to
stay. She consoled herself, however, that she was
known to be but nine miles distant from the rectory,
<PB N="296" REF="123"/>
and that any commands could be conveyed to her
nearly in an hour.</P>
<P>What they might be, became now, therefore,
her sole anxiety. Would not her Mother write?
After an avowal such as she had made of her deso∣late,
if not dying condition, would she not pardon
and embrace her? was it not even possible she
might come herself?</P>
<P>This idea mingled emotions of a contrariety
scarcely supportable. “O how,” she cried, “shall
I see her? Can joy blend with such terror? Can I
wish her approach, yet not dare to meet her eye?
—that eye which never yet has looked at me, but
to beam with bright kindness!—though a kind∣ness
that, even from my childhood, seemed to say,
Camilla, be blameless—or you break your Mother's
heart!—my poor unhappy Mother! she has al∣ways
seemed to have a presentiment, I was born to
bring her to sorrow!”</P>
<P>Expectation being now, for this night, wholly
dead, the excess of her bodily fatigue urged her to
take some repose: but her ever eager imagination
made her apprehensive her friends might find her
too well, and suspect her representation was but to
alarm them into returning kindness. A fourth
night, therefore, passed without sleep, or the re∣freshment
of taking off her cloathes; and by the
time the morning sun shone in upon her apart∣ment,
she was too seriously disordered to make her
illness require the aid of fancy. She was full of
fever, faint, pallid, weak, and shaken by nervous
tremors. “I think,” she cried, “I am now cer∣tainly
going; and never was death so welcomed by
one so young. It will end in soft peace my brief,
but stormy passage, and I shall owe to its solemn
call the sacred blessing of my offended Mother!”</P>
<P>Tranquillised by this hope, and this idea, she
now lost all sufferings but those of disease: her mind
grew calm, her spirits serene: all fears gave way to
the certainty of soothing kindness, all grief was
buried in the solemnity of expected dissolution.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="124"/>
But this composure outlived not the first hours
of the morning; as they vainly advanced, pro∣ducing
no loved presence, no letter, no summons;
solicitude revived, disappointment sunk her heart,
and dread preyed again upon her nerves. She
started at every sound; every breath of wind seem∣portentous;
she listened upon the stairs; she drag∣ged
her feeble limbs to the parlour, to be nearer
at hand; she forced them back again to her bed∣room,
to strain her aching eyes out of the win∣dow;
but still no voice demanded her, and no per∣son
approached.</P>
<P>Peggy, who repeatedly came to tell her the hour,
now assured her it was dinner time: unable to eat,
she was heedless of the hint this conveyed, and it
obtained from her no orders, till Peggy gave her
innocently to understand the expectations of her
host and hostess; but when, at five o'clock, the
table was served, all force and courage forsook her.
To be lest thus to herself, when her situation was
known; to be abandoned at an inn where she had
confessed she thought herself dying;—“My Mo∣ther,”
she cried, “cannot forgive me! my Father
himself deserts me! O Edgar! you did well to fly
so unhallowed a connexion!”</P>
<P>She left her dinner for Peggy, and crawling up
stairs, cast herself upon the bed, with a desperate
supplication she might rise from it no more. “The
time,” cried she, “is past for consolation, and dead

done!—<HI>May Heaven,</HI> said my honoured Mother,
<HI>spare me evil under your shape at least!</HI>—but under

<P>Dissolving, then, in sorrowing regret, recollecti∣ons
of maternal tenderness bathed her pillow with
her tears, and reversing all the inducements to her
sad resignation, abolished every wish but to fall▪

again at the parental feet. “To see,” cried she,
“once more, the dear authors of my being! to re∣ceive
their forgiveness, their blessing—to view
again their honoured countenances!—to hear once
more their loved speech—Alas! was it I that
fled the voice of my Mother? That voice which,
till that moment, had been music to my mind! and
never reached my ear, but as the precursor of all
kindness! why did I not sooner at once kneel at
her feet, and seek my lost path under my first and
best guide?”</P>
<P>Shocked and contrite in this tardy view of step
she ought to have taken, she now languished to
petition for pardon even for an offence unknown;
and rising, took up a pen to relate the whole trans∣action.
But her head was confused, and the at∣tempt
shewed her she was more ill than she had
even herself suspected. She thought all rapidly
advancing, and enthusiastically rejoiced.</P>
<P>Yet a second time she took the pen; but it had
not touched the paper, when a buzzing, confused,
sti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed sort of noise from without drew her to the
window.</P>
<P>She then perceived an immense crowd of people
approaching slowly, and from a distance, towards
the inn.</P>
<P>As they advanced, she was struck to hear no en∣crease
of noise, save from the nearer trampling of
feet. No voice was distinguishable; no one spoke
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouder than the rest; they seemed even to tread the
ground with caution. They consisted of labourers,
workmen, beggars, women, and children, joined
by some accidental passengers: yet the general
“hum of many” was all that was heard; they were
silent though numerous, solemn though mixt.</P>
<P>As they came near, she thought she perceived
something in the midst of them like a bier, and
caught a glimpse of a gentleman's habit. Startled,
she drew in; but soon, upon a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other view, discern∣ed
clearly a well-dressed man, stretched out his full
length, and apparently dead.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="126"/>
Recoiling, shuddering, she hastily shut the win∣dow,
“Yet why,” she cried, the next moment,
“and whence this emotion? Is not death what I
am meeting?—seeking?—desiring?—what I court?
what I pray for?”</P>
<P>She sighed, walked feebly up and down the
room, breathed hard and with effort, and then
forced herself again to open the window, deter∣mined
to contemplate steadily the anticipating ob∣ject
of her fervent demand.</P>
<P>Yet not without severe self-compulsion she flung
up again the sash; but when she looked out, the
crowd alone remained; the bier was gone.</P>
<P>Whether carried on, or brought into the house,
she now wished to know, with some particulars,
of whom it might be, and what belonged to so
strange and horrible an appearance.</P>
<P>She rang for little Peggy; but Peggy came not.
She rang again, but no one answered the bell. She
opened her door, meaning to descend to her little
parlour for information; but the murmuring buzz
she had before heard upon the road, was now
within the house, which seemed filled with people,
all busy and occupied, yet speaking low, and ap∣pearing
to partake of a general awe.</P>
<P>She could not venture to encounter so many
spectators; she shut her door, to wait quietly till
this first commotion should be passed.</P>
<P>This was not for more than an hour; when ob∣serving,
from her window, that the crowd was dis∣persed,
she again listened at the door, and found
that the general disturbance was succeeded by a
stillness the most profound.</P>
<P>She then rang again, and little Peggy appeared,
but looking pale and much frightened.</P>
<P>Camilla asked what had been the matter</P>
<P>“O ma'am,” she answered, crying, “here's
been murder! A gentleman has been murdered—
and nobody knows who he is, nor who has
done it!”</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="127"/>
She then related that he had been found dead
in a wood hard by, and one person calling another,
and another, he had been brought to the inn to be
owned.</P>
<P>“And is he here now?” with an involuntary
shudder, asked Camilla.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Yes, she answered, but her mistress had ordered
her not to own it, for fear of frightening the young
lady; and said he would soon be carried away.</P>
<P>The tale was shocking, and, though scarce con∣scious
why, Camilla desired Peggy to stay with her.</P>
<P>The little girl was most willing; but she was
presently called down stairs; and Camilla, with
strong shame of nameless fears and weak horror,
strove to meditate to some use upon this scene.</P>
<P>But her mind was disturbed, her composure was
gone; her thoughts were broken, abrupt, unfixed,
and all upon which she could dwell with any stea∣diness,
was the desire of one more appeal to her
family, that yet they would consent to see her, if
they received it in time; or that they should know
in what frame of mind she expired, should it
bring them too late.</P>
<P>With infinite difficulty, she then wrote the fol∣lowing
lines; every bending down of her head
making it ache nearly to distraction.</P>
<P>“Adieu, my dearest parents, if again it is de∣nied
me to see you! Adieu my darling sisters! my
tender uncle! I ask not now your forgiveness; I
know I shall possess it fully; my Father never
withheld it,—and my Mother, if against herself
alone I had sinned, would have been equally
lenient; would have probed but to heal, have
corrected but to pardon. O tenderest of united
partners! bless, then, the early ashes of your
erring, but adoring daughter, who, from the
moment she inflicted one wound upon your
bosoms, has found existence intolerable, and
prays now but for her earthly release!”</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>“CAMILLA TYROLD.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="301" REF="128"/>
This she gave to Peggy, with a charge that, at
any expence, it might be conveyed to the rectory
at Etherington immediately.</P>
<P>“And shall I not, thought she, when she had
rested from this exertion, and may I not at such
a period, with innocence, with propriety, write
one poor word to him who was so near becoming
first to me in all things?”</P>
<P>She again took her pen, but had only written
“O Edgar! in this last farewell be all displeasure
forgotten!—from the first to the final moment
of my short life, dear and sole possessor of my
heart!”—when the shooting anguish of her head
stopt her hand, and hastily writing the direction,
lest she could write no more, she, with difficulty
added, <HI>Not to be delivered till I am dead;</HI> and was
forced to lie down, and shut all light from her
strained and aching eyes.</P>
<P>Peggy presently brought her word that all the
horses were out, and every body was engaged, and
that the note could not possibly go till the next day.</P>
<P>Extremely disappointed, she begged to speak
with Mrs. Marl; who sent her word she was
much engaged, but would wait upon her as soon
as she was able.</P>
<P>Vainly, however, she expected her; it grew
dusk; felt herself worse every moment; flushed
with fever, or shivering with cold, and her head
nearly split asunder with agony. She determined
to go once more down stairs, and offer to her host
himself any reward he could claim, so he would
undertake the immediate delivery of the letter.</P>
<P>With difficulty she arose; with slow steps, and
tottering she descended; but as she approached her
little parlour, she heard voices in it, and stopt.
They spoke low, and she could not distinguish
them. The door of an adjoining room was open,
and by its stillness empty; she resolved to ring
there, to demand to speak with Mr. Marl. But
as she dragged her weak limbs into the apartment,
<PB N="302" REF="129"/>
she saw, stretched out upon a large table, the same
form, dress, and figure she had seen upon the bier.</P>
<P>Starting, almost fainting, but too much awed to
call out, she held trembling by the door.</P>
<P>The bodily feebleness which impeded her im∣mediate
retreat, gave force to a little mental re∣flection:
Do I shrink thus, thought she, from
what so earnestly I have prayed to become—and
so soon I must represent—a picture of death?</P>
<P>She now impelled herself towards the table. A
cloth covered the face; she stood still, hesitating
if she had power to remove it: but she thought it
a call to her own self-examination; and though
mentally recoiling, advanced. When close to the
table, she stood still, violently trembling. Yet
she would not allow herself to retreat. She now
put forth her hand; but it shook suspended over
the linen, without courage to draw it aside. At
length, however, with enthusiastic self compul∣sion,
slightly and fearfully, she lifted it up—
but instantly, and with instinctive horror, snatched
her hand away, and placed it before her shut eyes.</P>
<P>She felt, now, she had tried herself beyond her
courage, and, deeply moved, was fain to retreat;
but in letting down her hand, to see her way, she
found she had already removed the linen from a
part of the face, and the view she unintentionally
caught almost petrified her.</P>
<P>For some instants she stood motionless, from
want of strength to stir, but with closed eyes, that
feared to confirm their first surmise; but when,
turning from the ghastly visage, she attempted,
without another glance, to glide away, an unavoid∣able
view of the coat, which suddenly she recog∣nized,
put her conjecture beyond all doubt, that
she now saw dead before her the husband of her
sister.</P>
<P>Resentment, in gentle minds, however merited
and provoked, survives not the breath of the of∣fender.
With the certainty no further evil can
be practised, perishes vengeance against the culprit,
<PB N="303" REF="130"/>
though not hatred of the guilt: and though, with
the first movement of sisterly feelings, she would
have said, Is Eugenia then released? the awe was
too great, his own change was too solemn. He
was now where no human eye could follow, no
human judgment overtake him.</P>
<P>Again she endeavoured to escape the dreadful
scene, but her shaking limbs were refractory, and
would not support her. The mortal being re∣quires
use to be reconciled to its own visible mor∣tality;
dismal is its view; grim, repulsive, terrific
its aspect.</P>
<P>But no sooner was her head turned from the
dire object, than alarm for her sister took posses∣sion
of her soul; and with what recollection she
possessed, she determined to go to Belfont.</P>
<P>An idea of any active service invigorates the
body as well as the mind. She made another effort
to depart, but a glance she knew not how to avoid
shewed her, upon the coat of the right arm and
right side of this ghastly figure, large splashes of
blood.</P>
<P>With horror thus accumulated, she now sunk
upon the floor, inwardly exclaiming: He is mur∣dered
indeed!—and where may be Eugenia?</P>
<P>A woman who had in charge to watch by the
corpse, but who had privately stolen out for some
refreshment, now returning, saw with affright the
new person in the room, and ran to call Mrs.
Marl; who, alarmed also at the sight of the young
lady, and at her deplorable condition, assisted the
woman to remove her from the apartment, and
convey her to the chamber, where she was laid
down upon the bed, though she resisted being un∣dressed,
and was seized with an aguish shivering
fit, while her eyes seemed emitting sparks of fire.</P>
<P>“It is certainly now,” cried she, “over, and
hence I move no more!”</P>
<P>The joy with which, a few minutes before,
she would have welcomed such a belief, was now
converted into an awe unspeakable, undefinable.
<PB N="304" REF="131"/>
The wish of death is commonly but disgust of life,
and looks forward to nothing further than release
from worldly care:—but the something yet be∣yond—the
something unknown, untried, yet
to come, the <HI>bourne whence no traveller returns</HI> to
prepare succeeding passengers for what they may
expect now abruptly presented itself to her consi∣deration,—but came to scare, not to soothe.</P>
<P>All here, she cried, I have wished to leave—but—have I fitted myself for what I am to
meet?</P>
<P>Conscience now suddenly took the reins from
the hands of imagination, and a mist was cleared
away that hitherto, obscuring every duty by des∣pondence,
had hidden from her own perceptions
the faulty basis of her desire. Conscience took the
reins—and a mist was cleared away that had con∣cealed
from her view the cruelty of this egotism.</P>
<P>Those friends, it cried, which thus impatiently
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>ou seekest to quit, have they not loved, cherish∣ed,
reared thee with the most exquisite care and
kindness? If they are offended, who has offended
them? If thou art now abandoned, may it not be
from necessity, or from accident? When th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
hast inflicted upon them the severe pain of har∣bouring
anger against what is so dear to them,
wouldst thou load them with regret that they ma∣nifested
any sensibility of thy errors? Hast thou
plunged thy house in calamity, and will no wor∣thier
wish occur to thee, than to leave it to its
sorrows and distress, with the aggravating pangs of
causing thy afflicting, however blameable self∣desertion?
of coming to thee—perhaps even
now!—with mild forgiveness, and finding
thee a self devoted corpse?—not fallen, indeed, by
the profane hand of daring suicide, but equally
self-murdered through wilful self neglect.</P>
<P>Had the voice been allowed sound which spoke
this dire admonition, it could scarcely with more
horror, or keener repentance have struck her.
“That poor man,” she cried, “now delivering
<PB N="305" REF="132"/>
up his account, by whatever hand he perished, since
less principled, less instructed than myself, may be
criminal, perhaps, with less guilt!”</P>
<P>The thought now of her Father,—the piety he had
strove to inculcate into her mind; his resignation to
misfortune, and his trust through every suffering, all
came home to her heart, with religious veneration;
and making prayer succeed to remorse, guided her to
what she knew would be his guidance if present, and
she de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to hear the service for the sick.</P>
<P>Peggy could not read; Mrs. Marl was too much
engaged; the whole house had ample employment,
and her request was una<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tainable.</P>
<P>She then begged they would procure her a prayer∣book,
that she might try to read herself; but her eyes,
heavy, aching, and dim, glared upon the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per, with∣out
distinguishing the print from the margin.</P>
<P>“I am worse!” she cried faintly, “my wish
comes fast upon me! Ah! not for my punishment let
it finally arrive!”</P>
<P>With terror, however, even more than with malady,
she now trembled. The horrible sight she had wit∣nessed,
brought death before her in a new view. She
feared she had been presumptuous; she felt that her
preparations had all been worldly, her impatience
wholly selfish. She called back her wish, with peni∣tence
and affright: her agitation became torture, her
regret was aggravated to remorse, her grief to despair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Vision.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the first violence of this paroxysm of sor∣row
abated, Camilla again strove to pray, and found
that nothing so much stilled her. Yet, her faculties
confused, hurried, and in anguish, permitted little
more than incoherent ejaculations. Again she sighed
for her Father; again the spirit of his instructions re∣curred,
and she enquired who was the clergyman of
<PB N="306" REF="133"/>
the parish, and if he would be humane enough to come
and pray by one who had no claim upon him as a
parishioner.</P>
<P>Peggy said he was a very good gentleman, and ne∣ver
refused even the poorest person, that begged his
attendance.</P>
<P>“O go to him, then,” cried she, “directly!
Tell him a sick and helpless stranger implores that he
will read to her the prayers for the dying!—Should
I yet live—They will compose and make
me better;—if not—they will give me courage
for my quick exit.”</P>
<P>Peggy went forth, and she laid her beating head
upon the pillow, and endeavoured to quiet her nerves
for the sacred ceremony she demanded.</P>
<P>It was dark, and she was alone; the corpse she had
just quitted seemed still bleeding in full view. She
closed her eyes, but still saw it; she opened them,
but it was always there. She felt nearly stiff with
horror, chilled, frozen, with speechless apprehension.</P>
<P>A slumber, feverish nearly to delirium, at length
surprised her harrassed faculties; but not to afford
them rest. Death, in a visible figure, ghastly, pallid,
severe, appeared before her, and with its hand, sharp
and forked, struck abruptly upon her breast. She
screamed—but it was heavy as cold, and she could
not remove it. She trembled; she shrunk from its
touch; but it had iced her heart-strings. Every
vein was congealed; every stiffened limb stretched to
its full length, was hard as marble: and when again
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he made a feeble effort to rid her oppressed lungs of
the dire weight that had fallen upon them, a voice
hollow, deep, and distant, dreadfully pierced her ear,
calling out: “Thou hast but thy own wish! “Re∣joice,
thou murmurer, for thou diest!” Clearer,
sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iller, another voice quick vibrated in the air:
“Whither goest thou,” it cried, “and whence
comest thou?”</P>
<P>A voice from within, over which she thought she
had no controul, though it seemed issuing from her
vitals, low, hoarse, and tremulous, answered, “Whi∣ther
<PB N="307" REF="134"/>
I go, let me rest! Whence I come from let
me not look back! Those who gave me birth, I
have deserted; my life, my vital powers I have
rejected.” Quick then another voice assailed her.
so near, so loud, so terrible—she shri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked at its
horrible sound. “Prematurely,” it cried, “thou
art come, uncalled, unbidden; thy task unfulfilled,
thy peace unearned. Follow, follow me! the
Records of Eternity are opened. Come! write
with thy own hand thy claims, thy merits to
mercy!” A repelling self-accusation instantaneously
overwhelmed her. “O, no! no! no!” she ex∣claimed,
“let me not sign my own miserable in∣sufficiency!”
In vain was her appeal. A force
unseen, yet irresistible, impelled her forward. She
saw the immense volumes of Eternity, and her own
hand involuntarily grasped a pen of iron, and with a
velocity uncontroulable wrote these words: “Without
resignation, I have prayed for death: from impa∣tience
of displeasure, I have desired annihilation:
to dry my own eyes, I have left—pitiless,
selfish, unnatural!—a Father the most indul∣gent,
a Mother almost idolizing, to weep out
their's!” Her head would have sunk upon the
guilty characters; but her eye-lids refused to close,
and kept them gluring before her. They became, then,
illuminated with burning sulphur. She looked another
way; but they partook of the same motion; she cast
her eyes upwards, but she saw the characters still;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> turned from side to side; but they were always her
object. Loud ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in sounded the same direful voice:
“These are thy deserts; write now thy claims:—
and next,—and quick,—turn over the immortal leaves,
and read thy doom.”—“Oh, no!” she cried,
“Oh, no!”—“O, let me yet return! O, Earth,
with all thy sorrows, take, take me once again,
that better I may learn to work my way to that last
harbour, which, rejecting the criminal repiner,
opens its soft bosom to the firm, though supplicating
sufferer!” In vain again she called;—pleaded,
knelt, wept in vain. The time, she found, was past;
<PB N="308" REF="135"/>
she had slighted it while in her power; it would re∣turn
to her no more; and a thousand voices at once,
with awful vibration, answered aloud to every prayer,
“Death was thy own desire!” Again, unlicensed by
her will, her hand seized the iron instrument. The
book was open that demanded her claims. She wrote
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th difficulty—but saw that her pen made no
mark! She looked upon the page, when she thought
she had finished,—but the paper was blank!—Voices
then, by hundreds, by thousands, by millions,
from side to side, above, below, around, called out,
echoed and re-echoed, “Turn over, turn over—
and read thy eternal doom:” In the same instant, the
leaf, untouched, burst open—and—she awoke.
But in a trepidation so viol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, the bed shook under
her, the cold sweat, in large drops, fell from her
forehead, and her heart still seemed labouring under
the adamantine pressure of the inflexibly cold g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asp of
death. So exaited was her imagination, so confused
were all her thinking faculties, that she stared with
wild doubt whether then, or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether now, what she
experienced were a dream.</P>
<P>In this suspensive state, fearing to call, to move,
or almost to breath, she remained, in perfect stillness,
and in the dark, till little Peggy crept softly into the
chamber.</P>
<P>Certain then of her situation, “This has been,”
she cried, “only a vision—but my cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence has
abetted it, and I cannot shake it off.”</P>
<P>When she became calmer, and further recollected
herself, she anxiously enquired if the clergyman would
not come.</P>
<P>Peggy, hesitatingly, acknowledged he had not been
sent for; her mistress had imagined the request pro∣ceeded
from a disturbance of mind, owing to the sight
of the corpse, and said she was sure, after a little
sleep it would be forgotten.</P>
<P>“Alas!” said Camilla, disappointed, “it is more
necessary than ever! my senses are wandering; I seem
hovering between life and death—Ah! let not my”
<PB N="309" REF="136"/>
own fearful fancies absorb this hour of change, which
religious rites should consecrate!”</P>
<P>She then told Peggy to plead for her to her mis∣tress▪
and assure her that nothing else, after the
dreadful shock she had received, could still her mind.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marl, not long after came into the room her∣self;
and enquiring how she did, said, if she was
really bent upon such a melancholy thing, the cler∣gyman
had luckily just called, and would read the
service to her directly, if it would give her any com∣fort</P>
<P>“O, great and infinite comfort!” she cried, and
begged he might come immediately, and read to her
the prayer for those of whom there is but small hope
of recovery. She would have risen, that she might
kneel; but her limbs would not second her desire, and
she was obliged to lie still upon the outside of the
bed. Peggy drew the curtains, to shade her eyes, as
a candle was brought into the room; but when she
heard Mrs. Marl say: “Come in▪ Sir,”—and “here's
the prayer book;” overpowered with tender recol∣lection
of her Father, to whom such offices were fre∣quent,
she burst into an agony of tears, and hid her
face upon the pillow.</P>
<P>She soon▪ however, recovered, and the solemnity
of the preparation overawed her sorrow Mrs. Marl
placed the light as far as possible from the bed, and
when Camilla waved her hand in token of being
ready, said, “Now, Sir, if you please.”</P>
<P>He complied, though not immediately; but no
sooner had he begun, no sooner, devoutly, yet tremb∣lingly,
pronounced, <HI>O Father of Mercies!</HI> than a
faint scream issued from the bed.—</P>
<P>He stopt; but she did not speak; and after a
short pause, he resumed: but not a second sentence
was pronounced, when she feebly ejaculated, “Ah
heaven!” and the book fell from his hands.</P>
<P>She strove to raise her head, but could not; she
opened, however, the side curtain, to look out; he
advanced at the same moment, to the foot of the
<PB N="310" REF="137"/>
bed—fixed his eyes upon her face, and in a voice
that seemed to come from his soul, exclaimed, “Ca∣milla!”</P>
<P>With a mental emotion that, for an instant, re∣stored
her strength, she drew again the curtain, co∣vered
up her face, and sobbed even audibly, while
the words, “O Edgar!” vainly sought vent.</P>
<P>He attempted not to unclose the curtain she had
drawn, but with a deep groan, dropping upon his
knees on the outside, cried, “Great God!” but
checking himself, hastily arose, and mentioning to
Mrs. Marl and to Peggy, to move out of hearing,
said, through the curtain, “O Camilla! what dire
calamity has brought this about?—speak, I implore!
—why are you here?—why alone?—speak, speak!”</P>
<P>He heard she was weeping, but received no an∣swer,
and with energy next to torture, exclaimed;
“Refuse not to trust me!—recollect our long friend∣ship
—forgive—forget its alienation!—By all you
have ever valued—by all your wonted generosity—I
call—I appeal—Camilla! Camilla!—your silence
rends my soul!”</P>
<P>Camilla had no utterance, yet could not resist this
urgency, and gently through the opening of the
curtain, put forth her seeble hand.</P>
<P>He seemed affected to agony; he held it between
each of his own, and while softly he uttered, “O
ever—unchangeable generous Camilla!” she felt it
moistened with his tears.</P>
<P>Too weak for the new sensation this excited, she
drew it away, and the violence of her emotion me∣nacing
an hysteric fit. Mrs Marl came back to her,
and wringing his hands as he looked around the room,
he tore himself away.</P>

<P>She threw the covering from her face, and with
uplifted hands▪ exclaimed, “O Edgar!—could you
see me thus—and leave me?”—Yet eagerly seiz∣ing
the letter, called for a candle, and strove to read
it. But the characters seemed double to her weak
and dazzled eyes, and she was forced to relinquish
the attempt. She pressed it to her bosom, and again
covered herself up.</P>
<P>Something, nevertheless, like internal revival once
more, to her own unspeakable amazement, began
fluttering at her breast. She had seen the beloved
of her heart—dearer to her far than the life she
thought herself resigning; seen him penetrated to
anguish by her situation, awakened to the tenderest
recollections, and upon her hand had dropt a testi∣mony
of his sensibility, that, dead as she had thought
herself to the world, its views, its hopes, its cares,
passed straight to her heart—that wonderful reposi∣tory
of successive emotions, whence the expulsion of
one species of interest but makes way for the en∣trance
of another; and which vainly, while yet in
<PB N="312" REF="139"/>
mortal life, builds, even from hour to hour, upon
any chasm of mortal solicitude.</P>
<P>While wrapt up in this reverie, poignantly agi∣tating,
yet undefinably soothing, upon the return of
Edgar to England, and his astonishing appearance in
her room, her attention was again aroused by ano∣ther
gentle tap at the door</P>
<P>Peggy opened it, and left the room; but soon
came back, to beg an answer to the note, for which
the gentleman was waiting upon the stairs.</P>
<P>“Waiting?” she repeated, in extreme trepidati∣on,
“is he not then gone?”</P>
<P>“No, ma'am, only out of the room; he 'cant
go away without the answer, he says.”</P>
<P>A sensation of pleasure was now so new to Ca∣milla,
as almost to be too potent either for her
strength or her intellects. She doubted all around
her, doubted what she heard, doubted even her ex∣istence.
Edgar, could it be Edgar who was wait∣ing
for an answer?—who was under the same roof—
who had been in the same room—who was now se∣parated
from her but by a thin wainscot?—“O no,
no, no!” she cried, “my senses all delude me! one
vision after another beguiles my deranged imagina∣tion!”
Yet she called Peggy to her again, again
asked her if it were indeed true; and, bidding her
once more bring the candle, the new spirit with
which she was invigorated, enabled her to persevere
in her efforts, till she made out the following lines,
which were sealed, but not directed.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>“The sorrow, the tumult of my soul, I attempt
not to paint.—Forgive, O Camilla! an intrusion
which circumstances made resistless. Deign to bury
in kind oblivion all remembrance but of our early
friendship—our intuitive attachment, our confidence,
esteem, and happy juvenile intercourse; and under
such auspices—animated as they are innocent—per∣mit
me to hasten Mrs. Tyrold to this spot, or trust
me—I conjure—with the mystery of this dreadful
<PB N="313" REF="140"/>
desolation—O Camilla!—by all the scenes that have
passed between us—by the impression indelible they
have engraved upon my heart, wound not the most
faithful of your friends by rejecting his services!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>E. M.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Dissolved in tears of tenderness, relieving, nay de∣lightful,
she immediately sent him word that she
accepted his kind office, and should feel eternal gra∣titude
if he would acquaint her friends with her
situation.</P>
<P>Peggy soon informed her the gentleman was
gone; and she then inquired why he had been
brought to her as a clergyman.</P>
<P>The little girl gave the account with the utmost
simplicity. Her mistress, she said, knew the gentle∣man
very well, who was 'Squire Mandlebert, and
lived at a great house not many miles off; and had
just alighted to bait his horses, as she went to ask
about sending for the clergyman. He inquired who
was ill; and her mistress said it was a Lady who
had gone out of her mind, by seeing a dead body,
and raved of nothing but having prayers read to her;
which her husband would do, when his house was
clear, if the humour lasted: for they had nobody to
send three miles off; and by drawing the curtains,
she would not know if it was a clergyman or not.
The young 'Squire then asked if she was a lodger
or a traveller, and her mistress answered: “She's a
traveller, Sir; and if it had not been for Peggy's
knowing her, we should have been afraid who she
might be; for she stays here, and never pays us;
only she has given us a watch and a locket for
pledges.” Then he asked on some more questions,
continued Peggy, and presently desired to see the
locket; and when he had looked at it, he turned as
white as a sheet, and said he must see the lady. Her
mistress said she was laid down upon the bed, and
she could not send in a gentleman; unless it was her
husband; just to quiet her poor head by reading her
<PB N="314" REF="141"/>
a prayer or two. So then the 'Squire said he'd take
the prayer book and read to her himself, if she'd
spare time to go into the room first, and shut up the
curtains. So her mistress said no, at first; but Peggy
said the poor lady fretted on so badly, that presently
up they came together.</P>
<P>Ah! dear darling locket! internally cried Camilla,
how from the first have I loved—how to the last will
I prize it! Ah dear darling locket!—how for ever—
while I live—will I wear it in my bosom!</P>
<P>A calm now took place of her agonies that made
her seem in a renovated existence, till sleep, by gen∣tle
approaches, stole upon her again: not to bring
to her the dread vision which accompanied its first re∣turn;
nor yet to allow her tranquil repose. A softer
form appeared before her; more afflictive, though
not so horrible; it was the form of her Mother;
all displeasure removed from her penetrating counte∣nance;
no longer in her dying child viewing the
child that had offended her; yet while forgiving and
embracing▪ seeing her expire in her arms.</P>
<P>She awaked, affrighted,—she started, she sat up∣right;
she called aloud upon her Mother, and wildly
looking around, thought she saw her at the foot of
the bed.</P>
<P>She crossed her eyes with her hands, to endeavour
to clear her sight: but the object only seemed more
distinct. She bent forward, seeking conviction, yet
incredulous, though still meeting the same form.</P>
<P>Sighing, at last, from fruitless fatigue; 'tis won∣drous
odd,” she cried, “but I now never know when
I wake or when I sleep!”</P>
<P>The form glided away; but with motion so palpa∣ble,
she could no longer believe herself played upon
by imagination. Awe-imprest, and wonder-struck,
she softly opened her side-curtain to look after it. It
had stopt by a high chest of drawers, against which,
leaning its head upon its arm, it stood erect, but
seemed weeping. She could not discern the face;
but the whole figure had the same sacred resemblance.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="142"/>
The pulses of her head beat now with so much
violence, she was forced to hold her temples. Doubt,
dread, and hope seized every faculty at once; till,
at length, the upraised arm of the form before her
dropt, and she distinctly saw the profile: “It is
herself! it is my Mother!” she screamed, rather
than pronounced, and threw herself from the bed to
the floor.</P>
<P>“Yes! it is your Mother!” was repeated, in a
tone solemn and penetrating;—“to what a scene,
O Camilla, returned; her house abandoned—her son
in exile—her Eugenia lost—her husband, the prop of
all!—where she durst not name!—and thou, the child
of her bosom!—the constant terror, yet constant
darling of her soul—where, and how, does she see,
does she meet thee again—O Camilla!”</P>
<P>Then tenderly, though with anguish, bending over
her, she would have raised, and helped her to return
to the bed: but Camilla would not be aided; she
would not lift up her eyes; her face sought the
ground, where leaning it upon her hands, without
desiring to speak, without wishing to stir, torn by
self-reproaches that made her deem herself unworthy
to live, she remained speechless, immoveable.</P>
<P>“Repress, repress,” said Mrs. Tyrold, gently,
yet firmly, “these strong feelings, uselessly torturing
to us both. Raise your head, my poor girl—raise—
and repose it upon the breast of your Mother.”</P>
<P>“Of my Mother!” repeated Camilla, in a voice
hardly audible; “have I a Mother—who again will
own the blast of her hopes and happiness?—the dis∣grace,
the shame of the best and most injured of
Fathers!”</P>
<P>“Let us pray,” said Mrs. Tyrold, with a sigh,
“that these evils may pass away, and by salutary
exertions, not desponding repinings, earn back our
fugitive peace.”</P>
<P>Again she then would have raised her; but Ca∣milla
sunk from all assistance: “No,” she cried, “I
<PB N="316" REF="143"/>
am unworthy your lenity—I am unable even to
bear it.—”</P>
<P>“Camilla,” said Mrs. Tyrold, steadily, “it is
time to conquer this impetuous sensibility, which
already, in its effects, has nearly broken all our
hearts. With what horror have we missed—with
what agony sought you! Now then, that at length
we find you, excite not new terror, by consigning
yourself to willing despair.”</P>
<P>Struck with extreme dread of committing yet
further wrong, she lifted up her head, with inten∣tion
to have risen; but the weak state of her body,
forgotten by herself, and by Mrs. Tyrold unsus∣pected,
took its turn for demanding attention.</P>
<P>“Alas! my poor Child,” cried she, “what
horrible havock has this short absence produced!
O Camilla!—with a soul of feeling like yours,
—strong, tender, generous, and but too much
much alive, how is it you can thus have forgotten
the first ties of your duty, and your heart, and
have been wrought upon by your own sorrows to
forget the sorrows you inflict? Why have you thus
fled us? thus abandoned yourself to destruction?
Was our anger to be set in competition with our
misery? Was the fear of displeasure, from parents
who so tenderly love you, to be indulged at the
risk of never ending regret to the most lenient of
Fathers? and nearly the loss of senses to a Mother
who, from your birth, has idolized you in her
inmost soul?”</P>
<P>Bending then over her, she folded her in her
arms; where Camilla, overpowered with the strug∣gles
of joy and contrition, sunk nearly lifeless.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, seeing now her bodily feebleness,
put her to bed, with words of soothing tender∣ness,
no longer blended with retrospective investi∣gation;
conjuring her to be calm, to remember
whose peace and happiness were encircled in her
life and health, and to remit to her fuller strength
all further interesting discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="144"/>
“Ah! my Mother!” cried Camilla, “tell me
first—if the time may ever come when with truth
you can forgive me?”</P>
<P>“Alas, my darling chid!” answered the gene∣rous
Mother, “I have myself now to pardon that
I forgave thee not at first!”</P>
<P>Camilla seemed transported to another region;
with difficulty Mrs. Tyrold could hold her in her
bed, though hovering over her pillow with incessant
caresses: but to raise her eye only to meet that of
her Mother—not as her fertile terror had prophe∣sied,
darting unrelenting ire, but softly solicitous,
and exquisitely kind; to feel one loved hand anxi∣ously
upon her forehead, and to glue her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn lips
upon the other; to find fears that had made exist∣ence
insupportable, transformed into security that
rendered it delicious;—with a floating, uncertain,
yet irrepressible hope, that to Edgar she owed this
restoration, caused a revulsion in all her feelings,
that soon operated upon her frame—not, indeed,
with tranquillity, but with rapture approaching to
delirium:—when suddenly, a heavy, lumbering
noise, appalled her. “Ah, my Mother!” she
faintly cried, “our beloved Eugenia!—that
noise—where—and how—is Eugenia?—The
wretched Mr. Bellamy is no more!”</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold answered, she was acquainted with
the whole dreadful business, and would relate it
in a season of more serenity; but meanwhile, as
repose, she well knew, never associated with sus∣pense,
she satisfied immediate anxiety, by assuranc∣es
that Eugenia was safe, and at Etherington.</P>
<P>This was a joy scarce inferior to that which so
recently had transported her: but Mrs. Tyrold,
gathering from the good Peggy, that she had not
been in bed, nor scarce tasted food, since she had
been at the half-way house, refused all particulars,
till she had been refreshed with nourishment and
rest. The first immediately was ordered, and im∣mediately
taken; and Mrs. Tyrold, to propi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate
<PB N="318" REF="145"/>
the second, insisted upon total silence, and pre∣pared
to sit up with her all night.</P>
<P>Long as the extreme agitation of her spirits
distanced
<HI>Tir'd Nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Young.</NOTE>
the change from so much misery to heart-felt peace
and joy, with the judicious nursing and restoratives
devised by Mrs. Tyrold, for her weak and half
famished frame, made her slumber, when at
length it arrived, last so long that, though
broken by frequent starts, she awoke not till late
the next morning.</P>
<P>Her eyes then opened upon a felicity that again
made her think herself in a new world. Her
Mother, leaning over her, was watching her
breath, with hands uplifted for her preservation,
and looks of fondness which seemed to mark that
her happiness depended upon it's being granted;
but as she raised herself, to throw her arms around
the loved maternal neck, the shadow of another
form, quickly, yet gently receding, struck her
sight;—“Ah, Heaven!” she exclaimed, “who
is that?”</P>
<P>“Will you be good,” said Mrs. Tyrold gently,
“be tranquil, be composed, and earn that I should
tell you who has been watching by you this hour?”</P>
<P>Camilla could not answer; certain, now, who it
must be, her emotions became again uncontroula∣ble;
her horror, her remorse, her self-abhorrence
revived, and agonizingly exclaiming, “'Tis my
Father!—O, where can I hide my head'” She
strove again to envelop herself with the bed∣curtain
from all view.</P>
<P>“Here—in his own arms—upon his own breast
you shall hide it,” said Mr. Tyrold, returning to
the bed-side, “and all now shall be forgotten, but
thankfulness that our afflictions seem finding their
period.”</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="146"/>
“O my Father! my Father!” cried Camilla,
forgetting her situation, in her desire to throw
herself at his feet, “can you speak to me thus,
after the woe—the disgrace I have brought upon
you?—I deserve your malediction!—I expected
to be shut out from your heart,—I thought myself
abandoned—I looked forward only in death to re∣ceiving
your forgiveness!—”</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold held her still, while her Father
now blessed and embraced her, each uttering, in
the same moment, whatever was softest to console
her: but all her quick feelings were re-awakened
beyond their power to appease them; her penitence
tortured, her very gratitude tore her to pieces:
“O my Mother,” she cried, “how do you forbear
to spurn me? Can you think of what is passed,
and still pronounce your pardon? Will you not
draw it back at the sight of my injured Father?
Are you not tempted to think I deserve eternal
banishment from you both?—and to repent that
you have not ordered it?”</P>
<P>“No, my dearest Child, no! I lament only that
I took you not at once to your proper security—
to these arms, my Camilla, that now so fondly in∣fold
you! to this bosom—my darling girl!—where
my heart beats your welcome!”</P>
<P>“You make me too—too happy! the change is
almost killing! my Mother—my dearest Mother!
—I did not think you would permit me to ever
call you so again! My Father I knew would par∣don
me, for the chief suffering was his own; but
even he, I never expected could look at me thus
benignly again! and hardly—hardly would he have
been tried, if the evil had been reversed!”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold exhorted her to silent composure;
but finding her agitation overpower even her own
efforts, he summoned her to join him in solemn
thanks for her restoration.</P>
<P>Awfully, though most gratefully impressed by
such a call, she checked her emotion, and devoutly
<PB N="320" REF="147"/>
obeyed: and the short but pious ceremony quieted
her nerves, and calmed her mind.</P>
<P>The gentlest tranquillity then took place in her
breast, of the tumultuous joy which had first
chaced her deadly affliction. The soothing, how∣ever
serious turn, given by devotion to her changed
sensations, softened the acute excess of rapture
which mounted felicity nearly to agony. More
eloquent, as well as safer than any speech, was the
pause of deep gratitude, the silence of humble
praise, which ensued. Camilla, in each hand held
one of each beloved Parent; alternately she pressed
them with grateful reverence to her lips, alter∣nately
her eye sought each revered countenance,
and received, in the beaming sondness they emit∣ted,
a benediction that was balm to every woe.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="33" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Means to obtain a Boon.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold was soon, by urgent claims, forced
to leave them; and Camilla, with strong secret
anxiety to know if Edgar had caused this blest
meeting, led to a general explanation upon past
events.</P>
<P>And now, to her utter amazement, she found
that her letter sent by the labourer had never been
received.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold related, that she had no sooner
read the first letter addressed to her through Lavi∣nia,
than, softened and affected, she wrote an an∣swer
of the utmost kindness to Belfont; desiring
Camilla to continue with her sister till called for
by Miss Margland, in her return home from Mrs.
Macdersey. The visit, meanwhile to Cleves, had
transpired through Jacob, and, much touched by,
yet much blaming her travelling thus alone, she
<PB N="321" REF="148"/>
wrote to her a second time, charging her to remove
no more from Belfont without Miss Margland.
But, on the preceding morning, the first letter had
been returned with a note from Eugenia, that her
sister had set out two days before for Ethe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ington.</P>
<P>The moment of this intelligence, was the most
dreadful to Mr. Tyrold and herself of their lives.
Every species of conjecture was horrible. He set
out instantly for Belfont, determining to make
enquiries at every inn, house, and cottage, by the
way; but by taking, unfortunately, the road through
Alton, he had missed the half-way house. In the
evening, while, with apprehensions surpassing all
description, she was waiting some news, a chaise
drove up to the door. She slew out, but saw in
it—alone, cold, trembling, and scarce in he:
senses, Eugenia. Instantly imagining she came
with tidings of fatal tendency concerning Camilla,
she started back, exclaiming, “All then, is over?”
The chaise-door had been opened; but Eugenia,
shaking too violently to get out; only, and faintly,
answered, “Yes! my Mother—all is over!—”
The mistake was almost instantaneous death to
her—though the next words of Eugenia cleared it
up, and led to her own dreadful narrative.</P>
<P>Bellamy, as soon as Camilla had left Belfont,
had made a peremptory demand that his wife should
claim, as if for some purpose of her own, a large
sum of Sir Hugh. Her steady resistance sent him from
the house in a rage; and she saw no more of him
till that day at noon, when he returned in a deep∣er,
blacker wrath than she had ever yet seen; and
vowed that nothing less than her going in person
to her uncle with his request, should induce him
ever to forgive her. When he found her resolute
in refusal, he ordered a chaise, and made her get
into it, without saying for what purpose. She saw
they were travelling towards Cleves, but he did
not once speak, except where they changed horses,
till they came upon the cross-road, leading to the
half-way house. Suddenly then, bidding the
<PB N="322" REF="149"/>
postillion stop at the end of a lane, he told him he
was going to look at a little farm, and, ordering
him to wait, made her alight and walk down it till
they were out of sight of the man and the carri∣age.
Fiercely, then stopping short, “Will you
give me,” he cried, “your promise, upon oath,
that you will ask your Uncle for the money?”
“Indeed, Mr. Bellamy, I cannot!” she answered.
“Enough!” he cried, and took from his pocket
a pistol. “Good Heaven,” she said, “you will
not murder me?”—“I cannot live without the
money myself,” he answered, “and why should I
let you?” He then felt in his wais<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>coat pocket,
whence he took two bullets, telling her, she should
have the pleasure of seeing him load the pistol;
and that when one bullet had dispatched her, the
other should disappoint the executioner. Horror
now conquered her, and she solemnly promised to
ask whatever he dictated. “I must hold the pistol
to your ear,” cried he, “while you take your
oath. See! 'tis loaded—This is no child's play.”
He then lifted it up; but, at the same moment,
a distant voice exclaimed, “Hold villain! or you
are a dead man!” Starting, and meaning to hide
it within his waistcoat, his hand shook—the pistol
went off—it shot him through the body, and he
dropt down dead. Without sense or motion, she
fell by his side; and upon recovering found herself
again in the chaise. The postillion, who knew
her, had carried her thither, and brought her on
to Etherington. She then conjured that proper
persons might go back with the driver, and that
her Father would have the benevolence to super∣intend
all that could be done that would be most
respectfully decent.</P>
<P>The postillion acknowledged that it was himself
who had cried, Hold villain! A suspicion of some
mischief had occured to him from seeing the end
of a pistol jerk from the pocket of the gentleman,
as he got out of the chaise; and begging a man,
who accidentally passed while he waited, to watch
<PB N="323" REF="150"/>
his horses, he ran down a field by the side of the
lane, whence he heard the words: “The pistol is
loaded, and for no child's play!” upon which,
seeing it raised, and the young Lady shrink, he
called out. Yet Eugenia protested herself con∣vinced
that Bellamy had no real design against
either his own life or her's, though terror, at the
moment, had conquered her: he had meant but to
affright her into consent, knowing well her word
once given, with whatever violence torn from
her, would be held sacred. The rest was dreadful
accident, or Providence in that form playing upon
himself his own toils. The pious young Widow
was so miserable at this shocking exit, and the
shocking manner in which the remains were left
exposed, that her Mother had set out herself to
give orders in person, from the half-way house,
for bringing thither the body, till Mr. Tyrold
could give his own directions. She found, how∣ever,
that business already done. The man called
by the postillion had been joined by a party of la∣bourers,
just leaving off work; those had gathered
others; they had procured some broad planks
which served for a bier, and had humanely con∣veyed
the body to the inn, where the landlord was
assured the postillion would come back with some
account of him, though little Peggy had only
learnt in general that he had been found murdered
near a wood.</P>
<P>“Eugenia is just now,” said Mrs. Tyrold in
conclusion, “plunged into an abyss of ideas,
frightful to her humanity, and oppressive to the
tenderness of her heart. Her nature is too noble
to rejoice in a release to herself, worked by means
so horrible, and big with notions of retribution
for the wretched culprit, at which even vengeance
the most implacable might shudder. Nevertheless,
all will imperceptibly pass away, save the pity in∣herent
in all good minds for vice and its penalties.
To know his abrupt punishment, and not to be
shocked, would be inhuman; but to grieve with
<PB N="324" REF="151"/>
any regard for a man of such principles and conduct
would be an outrage to all that they have injured and
offended.”</P>
<P>This view of the transaction, by better reconciling
Camilla to the ultimate lot of her sister, brought her back
to reflect upon her own. Still she had not gathered with
precision how she had been discovered. To pronounce
the name of Edgar was impossible; but after a long
pause, which Mrs. Tyrold had hoped was given again
to repose, she ventured to say, “I have not yet
heard, my dearest Mother, to what benign chance I
immediately owe my present unspeakable, unmerited
happiness?”</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold looked at her a moment in silence, as
if to read what her question offered beyond its mere
words: but she saw her eye hastily withdrawn from
the examination, and her cheeks suddenly invelloped
with the bed cloaths.</P>
<P>Quietly, and without turning towards her again,
she resumed her narrative.</P>
<P>“I engaged the worthy postillion of my poor Eu∣genia
to drive me, purposing to send Ambrose on with
him, while I waited at the half-way house: but,
about two miles off, Ambrose, who rode before, was
stopt by a gentleman, whom he met in a post chaise;
when I came up to him, I stopt also. It was Mr.
Mandlebert.”</P>
<P>Camilla, who had looked up, now again hastily
drew back, and Mrs Tyrold, after a short pause, went
on.</P>
<P>“His intelligence, of course, finished my search.
My first idea was to convey you instantly home; but
the particulars I gathered made me fear removing
you. When I entered your room, you were asleep;—
I dreaded to surprise, yet could not refrain taking a
view of you, and while I looked, you suddenly
awoke.”</P>
<P>“Ah!” thought Camilla, 'tis to Edgar, then, that
ultimately I owe this blest moment!</P>
<P>“But my Father,” she cried, my dearest Mother,
—how came my dear Father to know where you had
found me?”</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="152"/>
“At Belfont he learnt the way you had set out,
and that Eugenia and Bellamy were from home; and▪
without loss of time—regardless of the night and
of fasting,—he returned by a route through which
he traced you at every inn where you had changed
horses. He, also, entered as you were sleeping—and
we watched together by your side.”</P>
<P>Again silial gratitude silenced all but itself, and
sleep, the softest she had known for many months, soon
gave to oblivion every care in Camilla.</P>
<P>The changeful tide of mental spirits from misery to
enjoyment, is not more rapid than the transition from
personal danger to safety, in the elastic period of
youth. 'Tis the epoch of extremes; and moderation,
by which alone we learn the true use of our blessings,
is a wisdom we are frequently only taught to appre∣ciate
when redundance no longer requires its practice.</P>
<P>Camilla, from sorrow the most desolate, bounded
to joy that refused a solicitude; and from an illness
that held her suspended between delirium and dissolu∣tion,
to case that had no complaint. The sufferings
which had deprived her of the benefit of the rest and
nourishment were no sooner removed, than she appeared
to be at once restored to health; though to repair the
wastes of strength some time yet was necessary.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold determined to carry her this afternoon
to Etherington. The remains of the wretched Bella∣my,
in a c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffin and hearse brought from Winchester,
had been sent to Belfont in the morning: and Mr.
Tyrold had followed, to give every direction that he
should be buried as the master of the house; without
reference to the conduct which had forfeited all such
respect.</P>
<P>Though the evil committed by the non-deliverence of
Camilla's letter was now passed all remedy, Mrs. Ty∣rold
thought it every way right to endeavour to discover
where laid the blame; and by the two usual modes of
menace and promises, she learnt that the countryman,
when he stopt to drink by the way, had in lighting
his pipe, let the letter take fire; and fearing to lose
the recompense he had expected, had set his conscience
<PB N="326" REF="153"/>
apart for a crown, and returned with the eventful
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alsehood, which had made Camilla think herself
abandoned, and her friends deplore as her as lost.</P>
<P>For the benefit of those with whom, in future, he
might have to deal, Mrs. Tyrold took some pains to
represent to him the cruel evils his dishonesty had pro∣duced;
but, stupid rather than wicked, what he had
done had been without weighing right from wrong,
and what he heard was without understanding it.</P>
<P>Camilla found with extreme satisfaction, that Mrs.
Tyrold, notwithstanding the strictness of the present
family oeconomy, meant liberally to recompense Mrs.
Marl, for the trouble and patience with which she had
attended to a guest so little profitable: while Peggy,
to whose grateful remembrance she owed the consi∣deration
she had met with in her deserted condition,
was rewarded by a much larger sum than she had ever
before possessed. Camilla was obliged to confess she
had parted with two pledges for future payment: the
watch was reclaimed without difficulty; but she shew∣ed
so much distress in naming the locket, that Mrs.
Tyrold, though she looked anxiously surprised, de∣manded
it without enquiring into its history.</P>
<P>The excess of delight to Camilla in preparing to
return to Etherington, rendered her insensible to all
fatigue, till she was descending the stairs; when the
recollection of the shock she had received from the
corpse of Bellamy, made her tremble so exceedingly,
that she could scarce walk past the door of the room
in which it had been laid. “Ah, my dearest Mo∣ther,”
she cried, “this house must give me always
the most penetrating sensations: I have experienced in
it the deepest grief, and the most heart-soothing enjoy∣ment
that ever, perhaps, gave place one to the other
in so short a time!”</P>
<P>Ambrose had announced their intended arrival, and
at the door of the house, the timid, but affectionate
Lavinia was waiting to receive them; and as Camilla,
in alighting, met her tender embraces, a well-known
<PB N="327" REF="154"/>
voice reached her ears, calling out in hurried accents,
“Where is she? Is she come indeed? Are you quite
sure?” And Sir Hugh, hobbling rather than walking
into the hall, solded her in his feeble arms, sobbing
over her: “I can't believe it for joy! Poor sinner
that I am, and the cause of all our bad doings! how
can I have deserved such a thing as this, to have my
own little Girl come back to me? which could not
have made my heart gladder, if I had had no share in
all this bad mischief! which, God knows I've had
enough, owing to my poor head doing always for the
worst, for all my being the oldest of us all; which is
a thing I've often thought remarkable enough, in the
point of my knowing no better; which however, I
hope my dear little Darling will excuse for the sake of
my love, which is never happy but in seeing her.”</P>
<P>The heart of Camilla bounded with grateful joy at
sight of this dear Uncle, and at so tender a reception:
and while with equal emotion, and equal weakness,
they were unable to support either each other or them∣selves,
the worthy old Jacob, his eyes running over,
came to help his Master back to the parlour, and Mrs.
Tyrold and Lavinia conveyed thither Camilla: who
was but just placed upon a sofa, by the side of her
fond Uncle, when the door of an inner apartment was
softly opened, and pale, wan, and meagre, Eugenia
appeared at it, saying, as faintly, yet with open arms,
she advanced to Camilla: “Let me too—your poor
harrassed, but half-alive Eugenia, make one in this
precious scene! Let me see the joy of my kind Uncle
—the revival of my honoured Mother, the happiness
of my dear Lavinia—and feel even my own heart beat
once more with delight in the bosom of its darling
Sister!—my so mourned—but now for ever, I trust,
restored to me, most dear Camilla!”</P>
<P>Camilla, thus encircled in her Mother's, Uncle's,
Sister's, arms at once, gasped, sighed, smiled, and
shed tears in the same grateful minute, while fondly
she strove to articulate, “Am I again at Etherington
and at Cleves in one? And thus indulgently re∣ceived?
thus more than forgiven? My heart wants
<PB N="328" REF="155"/>
room for its joy! my Mother! my Sisters! if you
knew what despair has been my portion! I feared even
the sight of my dear Uncle himself, lest the sorrows
and the errors of a creature he so kindly loved, should
have demolished his generous heart!”</P>
<P>“Mine, my dearest little Girl?” cried the Baro∣net,
“why what would that have signified, in com∣parison
to such a young one as yours, that ought to
know no sorrow yet a while? God knows, it being
time enough to begin: for it is but melancholy at best,
the cares of the world; which if you can't keep off
now, will be overtaking you at every turn.”</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold entreated Camilla might be spared
further conversation. Eugenia had already glided back
to her chamber, and begged, this one solacing inter∣view
over, to be dispensed with from joining the
family at present; Camilla was removed also to her
chamber; and the tender Mother divided her time and
her cares between these two recovered treasures of her
fondest affection.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Questions and Answers.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold did not return till the next day from
Belfont, where, through the account he gave from
his Daughter, the violent exit of the miserable Besla∣my
was brought in accidental death. Various circum∣stances
had now acquainted him with the history of
that wretched man, who was the younger son of the
master of a great gaming-house. In his first youth,
he had been utterly neglected, and left to run wild
whither he chose; but his father afterwards becoming
very rich, had bestowed upon him as good an educa∣tion
as the late period at which it was begun could
allow. He was intended for a. lucrative business;
but he had no application, and could retain no post:
<PB N="329" REF="156"/>
he went into the army; but he had no courage, and
was speedily cashiered. Inheriting a passion for the
means by which the parental fortune had been raised,
he devoted himself next to its pursuit, and won very
largely. But as extravagance and good luck, by long
custom, go hand in hand, he spent as fast as he ac∣quired;
and upon a tide of fortune in his disfavour,
was tempted to reverse chances by unfair play, was
found out, and as ignominiously chaced from the field
of hazard as from that of patriotism. His father was
no more; his eldest brother would not assist him; he
sold therefore his house, and all he possessed but his
wardrobe, and, relying upon a very uncommonly
handsome face and person, determined to seek a fairer.
lot, by eloping, if possible, and with some heiress
He thought it however prudent not only to retire
from London, but make a little change in his name,
which from Nicholas Gwigg he refined into Alphonso
Bellamy. He began his career by a tour into Wales;
where he insinuated himself into the acquaintance of
Mrs. Ecton, just after she had married Miss Melmond
to Mr. Berlinton: and though this was not an inter∣course
that could travel to Gretna-green, the beauty
and romantic turn of the bride of so disproportioned a
marriage, opened to his unprincipled mind a scheme
yet more flagi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious. Fortunately, however, for his
fair deffined prey, soon after the connexion was form∣ed,
she left Wales; and the search of new adventures
carried him, by various chances, into Hampshire.
But he had established with her, a correspondence,
and when he had caught, or rather <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orced, an heiress
into legal shares, the discovery of who and what he
was, became less important, and he ventured again
to town, and renewed his heinous plan, as well as his
inveterate early habits; till surprised by some unplea∣sant
recollectors, debts of honour, which he had found
it convenient to elude upon leaving the Capital, were
claimed, and found it impossible to appear without
satisfying such demands. Thence his cruel and inor∣dinate
persecution of his unhappy wife for money:
<PB N="330" REF="157"/>
and thence, ultimately, the brief vengeance which
had reverberated upon his own head.</P>
<P>Camilla, whose danger was the result of self∣neglect,
as her sufferings had all flowed from mental
anguish, was already able to go down to the study
upon the arrival of Mr. Tyrold: where she received,
with grateful rapture, the tender blessings which wel∣comed
her to the paternal arms—to her home—to
peace—to safety—and primaeval joy.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, sparing to her yet weak nerves any
immediate explanations upon the past, called upon
his wife to aid him to communicate, in the quietest
manner, what had been done at Belfont to Eugenia;
charging Camilla to take no part in a scene inevitably
shocking.</P>
<P>Once more in the appropriate apartment of her Fa∣ther,
where all her earliest scenes of gayest felicity
had passed, but which, of late, she had only ap∣proached
with terror, only entered to weep, she ex∣perienced
a delight almost awful in the renovation of
her pristine considence, and fearless ease. She took
from her pocket—where alone she could ever bear to
keep it—her loved locket, delighting to attribute to
it this restoration to domestic enjoyment; though
feeling at the same time, a renewal of suspence from
the return of its donor, and from the affecting inter∣view
into which she had been surprised, that broke in
upon even her filial happiness, with bitter, tyrannical
regret. Yet she pressed to her bosom the cherished
symbol of first regard, and was holding it to her lips,
when Mrs. Tyrold, unexpectedly, re-entered the room.</P>
<P>In extreme confusion, she shut it into its shagreen
case, and was going to restore it to her pocket; but
infolding it, with her daughter's hand, between each
of her own, Mrs. Tyrold said, “Shall I ever, my
dear girl, learn the history of this locket?”</P>
<P>“O yes, my dearest Mother,” said the blushing
Camilla, “of that—and of every—and of all things
—you have only—you have merely—”</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="158"/>
“If it distresses you, my dear child, we will leave
it to another day,” said Mrs Tyrold, whose eyes
Camilla saw, as she now raised her own, were swim∣ming
in tears.</P>
<P>“My Mother! my dearest Mother!” cried she,
with the tenderest alarm, “has any thing new hap∣pened?
—Is Eugenia greatly affected?”</P>
<P>“She is all every way, and in every respect,” said
Mrs. Tyrold, “whatever the fondest, or even the
proudest-Mother could wish. But I do not at this
instant most think of her. I am not with some fears
for my Camilla's strength, in the immediate demand
that may be made upon her fortitude. Tell me, my
child, with that sincerity which so long has been
mutually endearing between us, tell me if you think
you can see here, again, and as usual, without any
risk to your health, one long admitted and welcomed
as a part of the family?”</P>
<P>She started, changed colour, looked up, cast her
eyes on the floor; but soon seeing Mrs. Tyrold hold
an hankerchief bathed in tears to her face, lost all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,
and throwing her arms round her neck, “O my Mo∣the,”
she cried, “you who weep not for yourself—
scarcely even in the most poignant sorrow—can you
weep for me?—I will see—or I will avoid whoever
you please—I shall want no sortitude,—I shall fear
nothing—no one—not even myself—now again under
your protection! I will scarcely even think, my be∣loved
Mother, but by your guidance!”</P>
<P>“Compose yourself, then, my dearest girl: and,
if you believe you are equal to behaving with firmness,
I will not refuse his request of re-admission.”</P>
<P>“His request?” repeated Camilla, with involun∣tary
quickness; but finding Mrs. Tyrold did not no∣tice
it, gently adding, “That person that—I believe
—you mean—has done nothing, my dear Mother, to
merit expulsion!—”</P>
<P>“I am happy to hear you say so: I have been
searfully, I must own, and even piercingly displeased
with him.”</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="159"/>
“Ah, my dear Mother! how kind was the parti∣ality
that turned your displeasure so wrong a way!
that made you,—even you, my dear Mother, list<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
to your fondness rather than to your justice!—”</P>
<P>She trembled at the temerity of this vindication the
moment it had escaped her, and looking another way,
spoke again of Eugenia: but Mrs. Tyrold now, tak∣ing
both her hands, and seeking, though vainly, to
meet her eyes, said, “My dearest child, I grow
painfully anxious to end a thousand doubts; to speak
and to hear with no further ambiguity, nor reserve.
If Edgar—”</P>
<P>Camilla again changed colour, and strove to with∣draw
her hands.</P>
<P>“Take courage, my dear love, and let one final
explanation relieve us both at once. If Edgar has
merited well of you, why are you parted?—If ill—
why this solicitude my opinion of him should be
unshaken?”</P>
<P>Her head now dropt upon Mrs. Tyrold's shoulder,
as she faintly answered, “He deserves your good
opinion, my dearest Mother—for he adores you—I
cannot be unjust to him,—though he has made me—
I own—not very happy!”</P>
<P>“Designedly, my Camilla?”</P>
<P>“O, no, my dearest Mother!—he would not do
that to an enemy!”</P>
<P>“Speak out, then, and speak clearer, my dearest
Camilla. If you think of him so well, and are so
sure of his good intentions, what—in two words,—
what is it that has parted you?”</P>
<P>“Accident, my dearest Mother,—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding appear∣ances,
—and false internal reasoning on my part.—and
on his, continual misconstruction! O my dearest Mo∣ther!
how have I missed your guiding care! I had
ever the semblance, by some crue I circumstance, some
inexplicable fatality of incident, to neglect his coun∣sel,
oppose his judgment, deceive his expectations,
and trifle with his regard!—Yet, with a heart faith∣ful,
grateful, devoted,—O my dearest Mother!—
with an esteem that defies all comparison,—a respect
<PB N="333" REF="160"/>
closely meliorating even to veneration!—Never was
heart—my dearest Mother, so truly impressed with
the worth of another—with the nobleness—”</P>
<P>A buzzing noise from the adjoining parlour, sound∣ing
something between a struggle and a dispute, sud∣denly
stopt her,—and as she raised her head from the
bosom of her Mother, in which she had seemed seeking
shelter from the very confidence she was pouring forth,
she saw the door opened, and the object of whom she
was speaking appeared at it.—Fluttered, colouring,
trembling,—yet with eyes refulgent with joy, and
every feature speaking extacy.</P>
<P>Almost fainting w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h shame and surprise, she gave
herself up as disgraced, if not dishonoured evermore,
for a short, but bitter half moment. It was not
longer. Edgar, rushing forward, and seizing the
hands of Mrs. Tyrold, even while they were encircling
her drooping, shrinking, half expiring Camilla, pressed
them with ardent respect to his lips, rapidly exclaim∣ing,
“My more than Mother! my dear, kind excel∣lent,
inestimable friend!—Forgive this blest intrusion
—plead for me where I dare not now speak—and raise
your indeed maternal eyes upon the happinest—the most
devoted of your family!”</P>
<P>“What is it overpowers me thus this morning?”
cried Mrs. Tyrold, leaning her head upon her cling∣ing
Camilla, while large drops fell from her eyes,
“Misfortune, I see, is not the greatest test of our
philosophy!—Joy, twice to day, has completely
demolished mine!”</P>
<P>“What g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odness is this! what encouragement to
hope some indulgent intercession here—where the sense
that now breaks in upon me of ungenerous—ever to
be lamented—and I had nearly said, execrated doubt,
fills me with shame and regre—and makes me—even
at this soft reviving, heart-restoring moment, feel un∣deserving
my own hopes!”—</P>
<P>“Shall I—may I leave him to make his
peace?” whispered Mrs. Tyrold to her daughter,
whose head sought concealment even to annihilation;
but whose arms, with what force they possessed, de∣tained
<PB N="334" REF="161"/>
her, uttering faintly but rapidly, “O no,
no, no!”</P>
<P>“My more than Mother!” again cried Edgar,
“I will wait till that felicity may be accorded me,
and put myself wholly under your kind and powerful
influence. One thing alone I must say;—I have too
much to answer for, to take any share of the misde∣meanors
of another!—I have not been a treacherous
listener, though a wilful obtruder,—See, Mrs.
Tyrold! who placed me in that room—who is the
accomplice of my happiness!”</P>
<P>With a smile that seemed to beam but the more
brightly for her glistening eyes, Mrs. Tyrold looked
to the door, and saw there, leaning against it, the
form she most revered; surveying them all with an
expression of satisfaction so perfect, contentment so
benign, and pleasure mingled with so much thankful∣ness,
that her tears now flowed fast from unrestrained
delight; and Mr. Tyrold, approaching to press at once
the two objects of his most exquisite tenderness to his
breast, said, “This surprise was not planned, but
circumstances made it more than irresistible. It was
not, however, quite fair to my Camilla, and if she
is angry, we will be self-exiled till she can pardon
us.”</P>
<P>“This is such a dream,”—cried Camilla, as now,
first, from the voice of her Father she believed it rea∣lity;
“so incredible—so unintelligible—I
find it entirely—impossible—impossible to com∣prehend
any thing I see or hear!”</P>
<P>“Let the past,—not the present,” cried Edgar,
“be regarded as the dream! and generously drive it
from your mind as a fever of the brain, with which
reason had no share, and for which memory must find
no place.”</P>
<P>“If I could understand in the least,” said Camilla,
“what this all means—what—”</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now insisted that Edgar should retreat,
while he made some explanation; and then related to
his trembling, doubting▪ wondering daughter, the
following circumstances.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="162"/>
In returning from Belfont, he had stopt at the
half-way-house, where he had received from Mrs.
Marl, a letter that, had it reached him as it was in∣tended,
at Etherington, would have quickened the
general meeting, yet nearly have broken his heart. It
was that which, for want of a messenger, had never
been sent, and which Peggy, in cleaning the bed∣room,
had found under a table, where it had fallen,
she supposes, when the candle was put upon it for
reading prayers.</P>
<P>“There was another letter, too!” interrupted
Camilla, with quick blushing recollection;—“but
my illness—and all that has followed, made me
forget them both till this very moment—Did she
say any thing of any—other?”</P>
<P>“Yes;—the other had been delivered accord∣ing
to its address.”</P>
<P>“Good Heavens?”</P>
<P>“Be not frightened, my Camilla,—all has
been beautifully directed for the best. My accomplice
had received his early in the morning; he was at the
house, by some fortunate hazard when it was found,
and, being well known there, Mrs. Marl gave it to
him immediately.”</P>
<P>“How terrible!—It was meant only in case
—I had seen no one any more!”—</P>
<P>“The intent, and the event, have been happily,
my child, at war. He came instantly hither, and en∣quired
for me; I was not returned; he asked my
route, and rode to follow or meet me. About an
hour ago, we encountered upon the road: he gave
his horse to his groom, and came into the chaise to
me.”</P>
<P>Camilla now could with difficulty listen; but her
Father hastened to acquaint her, that Edgar, with the
most generous apologies, the most liberal self-blame,
had re-demanded his consent for a union, from which
every doubt was wholly, and even miraculously re∣moved,
by learning thus the true feelings of her heart,
as depicted at the awful crisis of expected dissolution.
The returning smiles which forced their way now
<PB N="336" REF="163"/>
through the tears and blushes of Camilla, shewed
how vainly she strove to mingle the regret of
shame with the felicity of sond security, produced
by this eventful accident. But when she further
heard that Edgar, in Flanders, had met with
Lionel, who, in frankly recounting his difficulties
and adventures, had named some circumstances
which had so shaken every opinion that had urged
him to quit England, as to induce him instantly,
from the conference, to seek a passage for his re∣turn,
she felt all but happiness retire from her
heart;—vanish even from her ideas.</P>
<P>“You are not angry, then,” said Mr. Tyrold,
as smilingly he read her delighted sensations, “that
I waited not to consult you? That I gave back at
once my consent? That I folded him again in my
arms?—again—called him my son?”</P>
<P>She could but seek the same pressure; and he
continued, “I would not bring him in with me;
I was not aware my dear girl was so rapidly reco∣vered,
and I had a task to fulfil to my poor Euge∣nia
that was still my first claim. But I promised
within an hour, your Mother, at least, should
welcome him. He would walk, he said, for that
period. When I met her, I hinted at what was
passing, and she followed me to our Eugenia; I
then briefly communicated my adventure; and your
Mother, my Camilla, lost herself in hearing it!
Will you not,—like me!—withdraw from
her all reverence? Her eyes gushed with tears,—
she wept, as you weep at this moment; she was
sure Edgar Mandlebert could alone preserve you
from danger, yet make you happy—Was she
wrong, my dear child? Shall we attack now her
judgment, as well as her fortitude?”</P>
<P>Only at her seet could Camilla shew her grati∣tude;
to action she had recourse, for words were
inadequate, and the tenderest caresses now spoke
best for them all.</P>
<P>Respect for the situation of Eugenia, who had
desired, for this week, to live wholly up stairs and
<PB N="337" REF="164"/>
alone, determined Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold to keep
back for some time the knowledge of this event
from the family. Camilla was most happy to pay
such an attention to her sister; but when Mr.
Tyrold was leaving her, to consult upon it with
Edgar, the ingenuousness of her nature urged her
irresistibly to say, “Since all this has passed, my
dearest Father—my dearest Mother—does it not
seem as if I should now myself—”</P>
<P>She stopt; but she was understood; they both
smiled, and Mr. Tyrold immediately bringing in
Edgar, said, “I find my pardon, my dear fellow∣culprit,
is already accorded; if you have doubts
of your own, try your eloquence for yourself.”</P>
<P>He left the room, and Mrs. Tyrold was gently
rising to quietly follow, but Camilla, with a look
of entreaty of which she knew the sincerity, and
would not resist the earnestness, detained her.</P>
<P>“Ah yes, stay, dearest Madam!” cried Edgar,
again respectfully taking her hand, “and through
your unalterable goodness, let me hope to procure
pardon for a distrust which I here for ever re∣nounce;
but which had its origin in my never
daring to hope what, at this moment, I have the
felicity to believe. Yet now, even now, without
your kind mediation, this dear convalescent may
plan some probationary trial at which my whole
mind, after this long suffering, revolts. Will you
be my caution, my dearest Mrs. Tyrold? Will
you venture—and will you deign to promise, that
if a full and generous forgiveness may be pro∣nounced
—”</P>
<P>“Forgiveness?” in a soft voice interrupted Ca∣milla:
“Have I any thing to forgive? I thought
all apology—all explanation, rested on my part!
and that my imprudencies—my rashness—my so
often-erring judgment—and so apparently, al∣most
even culpable conduct”—</P>
<P>“O, my Camilla! my now own Camilla!”
cried Edgar, venturing to change the hand of the
Mother for that of the daughter; “what too, too
<PB N="338" REF="165"/>
touching words and concessions are these! Suffer
me, then, to hope a kind amnesty may take place
of retrospection, a clear, liberal, open forgiveness
anticipate explanation and enquiry!”</P>
<P>“Are you sure,” said Camilla, smiling, “this
is your interest, and not mine?—Does he not
make a mistake, my dearest Mother, and turn my
advocate, instead of his own? And can I fairly
take advantage of such an error?”</P>
<P>The sun-shine of her returning smiles went
warm to her Mother's heart, and gave a glow to
the cheeks of Edgar, and a brightness to his eyes
that irradiated his whole countenance. “Your
penetrating judgment,” said he to Mrs Tyrold,
“will take in at once more than any professions,
any protestations can urge for me:—you see the
peace, the pardon which those eyes do not seek to
withhold—will you then venture, my more than
maternal friend! my Mother, in every meaning
which affection and reverence can give to that
revered appellation—will you venture at once—
now—upon this dear and ever after hallowed
minute—to seal the kind consent of my truly
paternal guardian, and to give me an example of
that trust and confidence which my whole future
life shall look upon as its lesson?”</P>
<P>“Yes!” answered Mrs. Tyrold, instantly join∣ing
their hands, “and with every security that the
happiness of all our lives—my child's, my hus∣band's,
your's, my valued Edgar, and my own,
will all owe their felicity to the blessing with which
I now lay my hands upon my two precious chil∣dren!”</P>
<P>Tears were the only language that could express
the fulness of joy which succeeded to so much
sorrow; and when Mr. Tyrold returned, and had
united his tenderest benediction with that of his
beloved wise, Edgar was permitted to remain alone
with Camilla; and the close of his long doubts,
and her own long perplexities, was a reciprocal
<PB N="339" REF="166"/>
confidence that left nothing untold, not an action
unrelated, not even a thought unacknowledged.</P>
<P>Edgar confessed that he no sooner had quitted
her, than he suspected the justice of his decision;
the turn which of late, he had taken, doubtfully
to watch her every action, and suspiciously to judge
her every motive, though it had impelled him in
her presence, ceased to operate in her absence.—
He was too noble to betray the well meant, though
not well applied warnings of Dr. Marchmont, yet
he acknowledged, that when left to cool reflection,
a thousand palliations arose for every step he could
not positively vindicate: and when, afterwards,
from the frank communication of Lionel, he learnt
what belonged to the mysterious offer of Sir Sedley
Clarendel, that she would superinted the disposal
of his fortune; and the deep obligation in which
she had been innocently involved, his heart smote
him for having judged 'ere he had investigated
that transaction; and in a perturbation unspeakable
of quick repentance, and tenderness, he set out
for England. But when, at the half-way house, he
stopt as usual to rest his horses in his way to Beech
Park,—what were his emotions at the sight of the
locket, which the landlady told him had been
pledged by a lady in distress! He besought her par∣don
for the manner in which he had made way to
her; but the almost frantic anxiety which seized
him to know if or not it was her, and to save her,
if so, from the intended intrusion of the landlord,
made him irresistibly prefer it to the plainer mode
which he should have adopted with any one else,
of sending in his name, and some message. His
shock at her view in such a state, he would not
now revive; but the impropriety of bidding the
landlady quit the chamber, and the impossibility
of entering into an explanation in her hearing,
alone repressed, at that agitated moment, the
avowal of every sensation with which his heart
was labouring. “But when,” he added, “shall I
cease to rejoice that I had listened to the good land∣lady's
<PB N="340" REF="167"/>
history of a sick guest, while all conjecture
was so remote from whom it might be! when I am
tempted to turn aside front a tale of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I will
recollect what I owe to having given one ear!”
Lost in wonder at what could have brought her
to such a situation, and disturbed how to present
himself at the rectory, till fixed in his plans, he
had ridden to the half-way house that morning, to
enquire concerning the corpse that Mrs. Marl had
mentioned—and there—while he was speaking with
her, the little maid brought down two letters—
one of them directed to himself.—</P>
<P>“What a rapid transition,” cried he, “was then
mine, from regrets, that robbed life of all charms,
to prospects which paint it in its most viv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d colours
of happiness! from wavering the most deplorable,
to resolutions of expiating by a whole life of de∣voted
fondness, the barbarous waywardness that
could deprive me, for one wilful moment, of the
exquisite felicity of my lot!—”</P>
<P>“But still,” said Camilla, “I do not quite un∣derstand
how you came in that room this morning?
and how you authorized yourself to overhear my
confessions to my Mother?”</P>
<P>“Recollect my acknowledged accomplice before
you hazard any blame! When I came hither—
somewhat, I confess, within my given hour, Mr.
Tyrold received me himself at the door. He told
me I was too soon, and took me into the front par∣lour.
The partition is thin. I heard my name
spoken by Mrs. Tyrold, and the gentle voice of
my Camilla, in accents yet more gentle than even
that voice ever spoke before, answering some ques∣tion;
I was not myself, at first, aware of its te∣nour
—but when, unavoidably, I gathered it—
when I heard words so beautifully harmonizing
with what I had so lately perused—I would in∣stantly
have ventured into the room; but Mr.
Tyrold feared surprising you—you went on—my
fascinated soul divested me of obedience—of cau∣tion—of
<PB N="341" REF="168"/>
all but joy and gratitude—and he could
no longer restrain me. And now with which of
her offenders will my Camilla quarrel?”</P>
<P>“With neither, I believe, just at present. The
conspiracy is so complex, and even my Mother so
nearly a party concerned, that I dare not risk the
unequal contest. I must only, in future,” added
she, similing, “speak ill of you—and then you
will find less pleasure in the thinness of a partition!”</P>
<P>Faithfully she returned his communication, by
the fullest, most candid, and unsparing account of
every transaction of her short life, from the still
shorter period of its being put into voluntary mo∣tion.
With nearly breathless interest, he listened
to the detail of her transactions with Sir Sedley
Clarendel, with pity to her debts, and with horror
to her difficulties. But when, through the whole
ingenuous narration, he found himself the con∣stant
object of every view, the ultimate motive to
every action, even where least it appeared, his hap∣piness,
and his gratitude, made Camilla soon for∣get
that sorrow had ever been known to her.</P>
<P>They then spoke of her two favourites Mrs.
Arlbery, and Mrs. Berlinton; and though she was
animated in her praise of the good qualities of the
first, and the sweet attraction of the last, she
confessed the danger, for one so new in the
world, of chusing friends distinct from those of
her family; and voluntarily promised, during
her present season of inexperience, to repose the
future choice of her connections, where she could
never be happy without their approvance.</P>
<P>The two hundred pounds to Sir Sedley Cla∣rendel,
he determined, on the very day that
Camilla should be his, to return to the Baronet,
under the privilege, and in the name of paying
it for a brother.</P>
<P>In conference thus softly balsamic to every
past wound, and thus deliciously opening to
that summit of earthly felicity—confidence unli∣mited
<PB N="342" REF="169"/>
entwined around affection unbounded—
hours might have passed, unnumbered and un∣awares,
had not prudence forced a separation, for
the repose of Camilla.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The last Touches of the Picture.</HEAD>
<P>LATE as Edgar quitted the rectory, he went
not straight to Beech Park; every tie both of
friendship and propriety carried him first to Dr.
Marchmont; who had too much feeling to won∣der
at the power of his late incitements, and
too much goodness of heart not to felicitate
him upon their issue, though he sighed at the
recollection of the disappointments whence his
own doubting counsel originated. Twice be∣trayed
in his dearest expectations, he had form∣ed
two criterions from his peculiar experience,
by which he had settled his opinion of the whole
female sex; and where opinion may humour
systematic prepossession, who shall build▪ upon his
virtue or wisdom to guard the transparency of his
impartiality?</P>
<P>The following day, the Westwyns presented
themselves at Etherington; hurried from a tour
they were taking through Devonshire and Corn∣wall,
by intelligence which had reached them
that Sir Hugh Tyrold was ruined, and Cleves
was to be let. They met, by chance, with
Edgar alone in the parlour; and the joy of
the old gentleman in hearing how small a
part of the rumour was founded in fact, made
<PB N="343" REF="170"/>
him shake hands with him as cordially for
setting him right, as Edgar welcomed his kind∣ness,
from the pleasure afforded by the sight
of such primitive regard. But when, presum∣ing
upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his peculiar intimacy in the family,
as ward of Mr. Tyrold, though without yet daring
to avow his approaching nearer affinity, Edgar
insisted upon his superior claim for supplanting
them in taking charge of the debt of his guardian;
Mr. Westwyn, almost angrily, protested he would
let no man upon earth, let him be whose ward he
pleased, shew more respect than himself for the
brother of Sir Hugh Tyrold; “and Hal thinks
the same too,” he added, “or he's no son of mine.
And so he'll soon shew you, in a way you can't
guess, I give you my word. At least that's my
opinion.”</P>
<P>He then took his son apart, and abruptly
whispered to him, “As that pretty girl you
and I took such a fancy to, at Southton,
served us in that shabby manner, because of
meeting with that old Lord, it's my opinion
you'd do the right thing to take her sister;
who's pretty near as pretty, and gives herself
no airs; and that will be shewing respect for
my worthy old friend, now he's down in
the world; which is exactly that he did for
me when I was down myself. For if he
had not lent me that thousand pounds I told
you of, when not a relation I had▪ would
lend me a hundred, I might have been ruin∣ed
before ever you were born. Come, tell
me your mind, Hal! off or on? don't stand
shilly shally; i'ts what I can't bear; speak
honestly; I won't have your choice controll∣ed;
only this one thing I must tell you
without ceremony, I shall never think well
of you again as long as ever I live, if you
demur so much as a moment. It's what I
can't bear; it i'n't doing a thing handsomely.
I can't say I like it.”</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="171"/>
The appearance of Lavinia relieved the immediate
embarrassment of Henry, while the modest pleasure
with which she received them confirmed the partiality
of both. The eagerness, however, of the father,
admitted of no delay, and when Sir Hugh entered the
room, the son's assent being obtained, he warmly de∣manded
the fair Lavinia for his daughter-in-law.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh received the proposition with the most
copious satisfaction; Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold with equal,
though more anxious delight; and Lavinia herself with
blushing but unaffected hopes of happiness.</P>
<P>Whatever was known to Sir Hugh, no cautions,
nor even his own best designs, could save from being
known to the whole house. Eugenia, therefore, was
unavoidably informed of this transaction; and the
generous pleasure with which she revived from the
almost settled melancholy left upon her, by continual
misfortunes, justified the impatience of Edgar to ac∣cel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate
the allowed period for publishing his own
happy history.</P>
<P>Eugenia wept with joy at tidings so precious of her
belov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sister, through whom, and her other dear
friends, she was alone, she said, susceptible of joy,
though to all sorrow she henceforth bid adieu, “For
henceforth,” she cried, “I mean to regard myself as
if already I had passed the busy period of youth and of
life, and were only a spectatress of others. For this
purpose, I have begun writing my memoirs, which
will amuse my solitude▪ and confirm my—I hope,
philosophical idea.”</P>
<P>She then produced the opening of her intended
book.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<P>“No blooming coquette, elated with adulation and
triumphant with conquest, here counts the glories
of her eyes, or enumerates the train of her adorers:
no beauteous prude, repines at the fatigue of ad∣miration,
nor bewails the necessity of tyranny: O
gentle reader! you have the story of one from
<PB N="345" REF="172"/>
whom fate has withheld all the delicacy of vanity,
all the regale of cruelty—!”</P>
<P>“Here,” interrupted the young biographer, “will
follow my portrait, and then this further address
to my readers.”</P>
<P>“O ye, who, young and fair, revel in the attrac∣tions
of beauty, and exult in the pride of admiration,
say, where is your envy of the heiress to whom
fortune comes with such alloys? And which how∣ever
distressed or impoverished, would accept my
income with my personal defects?”</P>
<P>“Ye, too, O lords of the creation, mighty men!
impute not to native vanity the repining spirit with
which I lament the loss of beauty; attribute not to
the innate weakness of my sex, the concern I confess
for my deformity; nor to feminine littleness of
soul, a regret of which the true source is to be
traced to your own bosoms, and springs from your
own tastes: for the value you yourselves set upon
external attractions, your own neglect has taught
me to know; and the indifferency with which you
consider all else, your own duplicity has instructed
me to feel.”</P>
<P>Camilla sought to dissuade her from reflexions so
afflictive, and retrospections so poignant; but they
aided her, she said, in her task of acquiring composure
for the regulation of her future life.</P>
<P>Edgar now received permission to make his commu∣nication
to the Baronet.</P>
<P>The joy with which Sir Hugh heard it, was for
some time over-clouded by doubt. “My dear Mr.
young Edgar,” he said, “in case you don't know
your own mind yet, in the point of it's nor changing
again, as it did before, I'd as lieve you would not
tell me of it till you've taken the proper time to be at
a certainty; frettings about these ups and downs,
being what do no good to me, in point of the gout.”</P>
<P>But when thoroughly re-assured, “Well,” he
cried, “this is just the thing I should have chose
out of all our misfortunes, being what makes me
happier than ever I was in my life; except once be∣fore
<PB N="346" REF="173"/>
on the very same account, which all turned out
to end in nothing: which I hope won't happen any
more: for now I've only to pay off all our debts, and
then I may go back again to Cleves, which I shall be
glad enough to do, it being but an awkward thing to
a man, after he's past boyhood, having no home of
his own.”</P>
<P>A sigh at the recollection of the change in his situ∣ation,
since his plan was last agitated, checked his
selicity, and depressed even that of Edger, who, with
the most tender earnestness, besought his leave to
advance the sum requisite to return him tranquilly to
his mansion; but who could not prevail, till Camilla
joined in the petition, and permitted Edgar, in both
their names to entreat, as their dearest wish, that they
might be united, according to the first arrangement,
from Cleves</P>
<P>This the Baronet could not resist, and preparations
were rapidly made for re-instating him in his dwelling,
and for the double marriages destined to take place
upon his return.</P>
<P>“Well, then, this,” cried he, as he poured upon them
his tenderest blessings and caresses, “is the oddest of
all! My dear little Camilla, that I took all my fortune
from, is the very person to give me her's as soon as
ever she gets it! as well as my own house over my
old head again, after my turning her, as one may
say, out of it! which is a thing as curious, in point
of us poor ignorant mortals, as if my brother had put
it in a sermon.”</P>
<P>“Such turns in the tide of fortune,” said Mr.
Tyrold, “are amongst the happiest lessons of huma∣nity,
where those who have served the humble and
helpless from motives of pure disinterestedness, find
they have made useful friends for themselves, in the
perpetual vicissitudes of our unstable condition.”</P>
<P>“Why, then, there's but one thing more, by what
I can make out,” said the Baronet, “that need be
much upon my mind, and that I've been thinking
some time about, in point of forming a scheme to get
rid of, which I think I've got a pretty good one: for
<PB N="347" REF="174"/>
here's Lavinia going to be married to the very
oldest friend I have in the world; that is, to his
son, which is the same thing in point of bringing us
all together; and my own dear little girl, to the
best gentleman in the county, except for that one
thing of going off at the first, which I dare say he did
not mean, for which reason I shall mention it no
more: and Indiana, to one of those young ap∣tains,
that I can't pretend I know much of; but
that's very excusable in so young a person, not
having had much head from the beginning; which
I always make allowance for; my own not being
over extraordinary: and Eugenia, poor thing,
being a widow already; for which God be praised;
which I hope is no sin, in point of the poor lad
that's gone not belonging to any of u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by what I
can make out, except by his own doing whether
we would or not; which, however, is neither
here nor there, now he's gone; for Eugenia being
no beauty, and Clermont having as good as said so,
I suppose she thought she must not be too difficult;
which is a thing young girls are apt to fall into;
and boys too, for the matter of that; for, by what
I can make out of life, I don't see but what a
scholar thinks a girl had better be pretty than not,
as much as another man.”</P>
<P>“But what, my dear brother,” said Mr. Tyrold,
“is your new distress and new scheme?”</P>
<P>“Why I can't say but what I'm a little put out,
that Indiana should forget poor Mrs. Margland,
in the particular of asking her to go to live with
her; which, however I dare say she can't help,
those young captains commonly not over liking
having elderly persons about them; not that I
mean to guess her age, which I take to be fifty,
and upwards; which is no point of ours. But the
thing I'm thinking of is Dr. Orkborne, in the case
of their marrying one another.”</P>
<P>“My dear brother!—has any such idea oc∣curred
to them?”</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="175"/>
“Not as I know of; but Indiana having done
with one, and Eugenia with the other, and me,
Lord help me! not wanting either of them, why
what can I do if they won't? the Doctor's asked
to go to town, for the sake of printing his papers,
which I begged him not to hurry, for I'm but lit∣tle
fit for learning conversation just now; though
when he's here, he commonly says nothing; only
taking out his tablets to write down something
that comes into his head, as I suppose: which I
can't say is very entertaining in the light of a com∣panion.
However, as to his having called me a
blockhead, it's not what I take umbrage at, not
being a wit being a fault of no man's, except of
nature, which nobody has a right to be angry at.
Besides, as to his having a little pride, it's what
I owe to him no ill-will for; a scholar having
nothing else but his learning, is excusable for
making the most of it. However, if they would
marry one another, I can't but say I should take
it very well of them. The only thing I know
against it, is the mortal dislike they have to one
another: and that, my dear brother, is the point
I want to consult you about; for then we shall be
got off all round: which would be a great thing
off my mind.”</P>
<P>When the happy day arrived for returning to
Cleves, Sir Hugh re-took possession of his hospi∣table
mansion, amidst the tenderest felicitations of
his fond family, and the almost clamorous rejoic∣ings
of the assembled poor of the neighbourhood:
and the following morning, Mr. Tyrold gave the
hand of Lavinia to Harry Westwyn, and Dr.
Marchmont united them; and Edgar, glowing
with happiness, now purified from any alloy, re∣ceived
from the same revered hand, and owed to
the same honoured voice, the final and lasting
possession of the tearful, but happy Camilla.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="176"/>
What further remains to finish this small sketch
of a Picture of Youth, may be comprised in a few
pages.</P>
<P>Indiana was more fortunate in her northern ex∣pedition,
than experiments of that nature com∣monly
prove. Macdersey was a man of honour,
and possessed better claims to her than he had either
language or skill to explain: but the good Lord
O'Lerney, who, to benevolence the most chearful,
and keenness the least severe, joined judgment and
generosity, acted as the guardian of his kinsman,
and placed the young couple in competence and
comfort.</P>
<P>The profession of Macdersey obliging him to
sojourn frequently in country quarters, Indiana,
when the first novelty of téte-à-têtes was over,
wished again for the constant adulatress of her
charms and endowments, and, to the inexpressible
rapture of Sir Hugh, solicited Miss Margland to
be her companion: and the influence of constant
flattery was so seductive to her weak mind, that,
though insensible to the higher motive of cherish∣ing
her in remembrance of her long cares, she was
so spoilt by her blandishments, and so accustomed
to her management, that she parted from her no
more.</P>
<P>Lavinia, with her deserving partner spent a
month between Cleves and Etherington, and then
accompanied him and his fond father to their
Yorkshire estate and residence. Like all characters
of radical worth, she grew daily upon the esteem
and affection of her new family, and found in her
husband as marked a contrast with Clermont Lyn∣mere,
to annul all Hypothesis of Education, as
Lord O'Lerney, cool, rational, and penetrating,
opposed to Macdersey, wild, excentric, and vehe∣ment,
offered against all that is National. Brought
up under the same tutor, the same masters, and at
the same university, with equal care, equal ex∣pence,
equal opportunities of every kind, Clermont
turned out conceited, voluptuous, and shallow;
<PB N="350" REF="177"/>
Henry modest, full of feeling, and stored with in∣telligence.</P>
<P>Lionel, first enraged, but next <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amed, by the
disinheritance which he had drawn upon himself,
had ample subject in his disappointmen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to keep
alive his repentance. And though enabled to re∣turn
from banishment, by the ignominious con∣demnation,
with another culprit, of the late
partner in his guilt, he felt so lowered from his
fallen prospects, and so gloomy from his altered
spirits, that when his parents, satisfied with his
punishment, held out the olive-branch to invite
him home, he came forth again rather as if con∣demned,
than forgiven; and, wholly wanting sor∣titude
either to see or to avoid his former associates,
he procured an appointment that carried him
abroad, where his friends induced him to remain,
till his bad habits, as well as bad connections, were
forgotten, and time aided adversity in forming
him a new character.</P>
<P>Clermont, for whom his uncle bought a com∣mission,
fixed himself in the army; though with
no greater love of his country, than was appendant
to the opportunity it afforded of shewing his fine
person to regimental advantage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was amongst the first to hasten
with congratulations to Camilla. With too much
understanding to betray her pique upon the error
of her judgment, as to the means of attaching
Mandlebert, she had too much goodness of heart
not to rejoice in the happiness of her young friend.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lissin, who accompanied her in the wed∣ding
visit, confessed herself the most disappointed
and distressed of human beings. She had not, she
said, half so much liberty as when she lived with
her Papa, and heartily repented marrying, and
wished she had never thought of it. The servants
were always teazing her for orders and directions;
every thing that went wrong, it was always she
who was asked why it was not right; when she
wanted to be driving about all day, the coachman
<PB N="351" REF="178"/>
always said it was too much for the horses; when
she travelled, the maids always asked her what must
be packed up; if she happened to be out at dinner
time, Mr. Lissin found fault with every thing's
being cold: if she wanted to do something she
liked, he said she had better let it alone; and, in
fine, her violent desire of this state of freedom,
ended in conceiving it a state of bondage; she
found <HI>her own house</HI> the house of which she must
take the charge; being <HI>her own mistress,</HI> having the
burthen of superintending a whole family, and be∣ing
<HI>married,</HI> becoming the property of another, to
whom she made over a legal right to treat her just
as he pleased. And as she had chosen neither for
character, nor for disposition, neither from sym∣pathy
nor respect, she found it hard to submit
where she meant to become independent, and dif∣ficult
to take the cares where she had made no
provision for the solaces of domestic life.</P>
<P>The notable Mrs. Mittin contrived soon to so
usefully ingratiate herself in the favour of Mr.
Dennel, that, in the full pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion she would save
him half his annual expences, he married her: but
her friend, Mr. Clykes, was robbed in his jour∣ney
home of the cash which he had so dishonour∣ably
gained.</P>
<P>The first care of Edgar was to clear every debt
in which Camilla had borne any share, and then
to make over to Lavinia the little portion in∣tended
to be parted between the sisters. Henry
would have resisted; but Mr. Tyrold knew the
fortune of Edgar to be fully adequate to his gene∣rosity,
and sustained the proposition. Sir Sedley
Clarendel received his two hundred pounds with∣out
opposition, though with surprise; and was
dubious whether to rejoice in the shackles he had
escaped, or to lament the charmer he had lost.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh would suffer no one but himself to
clear the debts of his two nephews, or re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und
what had been advanced by his excellent old
<PB N="352" REF="179"/>
friend Mr. Westwyn. He called back all his
servants, liberally recompensed their marked
attachment, provided particularly for good old
Jacob; and took upon himself the most am∣ple
reward for the postillion who meant to
rescue Eugenia.</P>
<P>The prisoner and his wife, now worthy estab∣lished
cottagers, were the first, at the entrance of
Beech Park, to welcome the bride and bridgroom;
and little Peggy Higden was sent for immediately,
and placed, with extremest kindness, where she
might rise in use and in profit.</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney was sedulously sought by Edgar,
who had the infinite happiness to see Camilla a
selected friend of Lady Isabella Irby, whose bene∣volent
care of her in the season of her utter dis∣tress,
had softly enchained her tenderest gratitude,
and had excited in himself an almost adoring res∣pect.</P>
<P>Melmond had received in time the caution of
Camilla, to prevent the meeting to which the
baseness of Bellamy was deluding his misguided
sister, through her own wild theories. He forbore
to blast her fame by calling him publicly to ac∣count;
and 'ere further arts could be practised,
Bellamy was no more.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, in the shock of sudden sorrow,
shut herself up from the world. Claims of debts
of honour, which she had no means to answer,
pursued her in her retreat; she became at once the
prey of grief, repentance, and shame; and her
mind was yet young enough in wrong, to be pene∣trated
by the early chastisement of calamity. Re∣moved
from the whirl of pleasure, which takes
reflection from action, and feeling from thought,
she reviewed, with poignant contrition, her grace∣less
misconduct with regard to Eugenia, detested
her infatuation, and humbled herself to implore
forgiveness. Her aunt seized the agitating mo∣ment
of self-upbraiding and worldly disgust, to
<PB N="353" REF="180"/>
impress upon her fears the lessons of her opening
life: and thus, repulsed from passion, and sickened
of dissipation, though too illiberally instructed for
chearful and rational piety, she was happily
snatched from utter ruin by protecting, though
excentric enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Eugenia, for some time, continued in voluntary
seclusion, happily reaping from the fruits of her
education and her virtues, resources and reflexions
for retirement, that robbed it of weariness. The
name, the recollection of Bellamy, always made her
shudder, but the peace of perfect innocence was soon
restored to her mind. The sufferings of. Mrs. Berlin∣ton
from self-reproach, taught her yet more fully
to value the felicity of blamelessness; and the gene∣rous
liberality of her character, made the first in∣ducement
she felt for exertion, the benevolence of
giving solace to a penitent who had injured her.</P>
<P>Melmond, long conscious of her worth, and
disgusted with all that had rivalled it in his mind,
with the fervour of sincerity, yet diffidence of
shame and regret, now fearfully sought the favour
he before had reluctantly received. But Eugenia
retreated. She had no courage for a new engage∣ment,
no faith for new vows, no hope for new
happiness: till his really exemplary character, with
the sympathy of his feelings, and the similarity of
his taste and turn of mind with her own, made
the Tyrolds, when they perceived his ascendance,
second his wishes. Approbation so sacred, joined
to a prepossession so tender, soon conquered every
timid difficulty in the ingenuous Eugenia; who in
his well-earnt esteem, and grateful affection, re∣ceived,
at length, the recompence of every exerted
virtue, and the solace of every past suffering.
Melmond, in a companion delighting in all his
favourite pursuits, and capable of joining even in
his severer studies, sound a charm to beguile from
him all former regret, while reason and experi∣ence
endeared his ultimate choice. Eugenia once

loved, was loved for ever. Where her counte∣nance
was looked at, her complexion was forgo∣ten;
while her voice was heard, her figure was
unobserved; where her virtues were known,
they seemed but to be enhanced by her personal
misfortunes.</P>
<P>The Baronet was enchanted to see her thus un∣expectedly
happy, and soon transferred to Mel∣mond
the classical respe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which Clermont had for∣feited,
when he concurred with Eugenia in a peti∣tion,
that Dr. Orkborne, without further delay,
might be enabled to retire to his own plans and
pursuits, with such just and honourable considera∣tion
for labours he well knew how to appreciate,
as his friend Mr. Tyrold should judge to be worthy
of his acceptance.</P>
<P>With joy expanding to that thankfulness which
may be called the <HI>beauty of piety,</HI> the virtuous
Tyrolds, as their first blessings, received these
blessings of their children: and the benesicent Sir
Hugh felt every wish so satisfied, he could s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely
occupy himself again with a project—save a
maxim of prudence drawn from his own experi∣ence,
which he daily planned teaching to the little
generation rising around him; To avoid, from
the disasters of their Uncle, the Dangers and
Temptations, to their Descendants, of Unsettled
Collateral Expectations.</P>
<P>Thus ended the long conflicts, doubts, suspenc∣es,
and sufferings of Edgar and Camilla; who,
without one inevitable calamity, one unavaidable
distress, so nearly fell the sacrifice to the two ex∣tremes
of Imprudence, and Suspicion, to the na∣tural
heedlessness of youth unguided, or to the
acquired distrust of experience that had been
wounded Edgar, by generous confidence, became
the repository of her every thought; and her
friends read her exquisite lot in a gaiety no longer
to be feared: while, faithful to his word, making
Etherington, Cleves, and Beech Park, his al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernate

dwellings, he rarely parted her from her fond
Parents, and enraptured Uncle. And Dr. March∣mont,
as he saw the pure innocence, open frank∣ness,
and spotless honour of her heart, found her
virtues, her errors, her facility, or her desperation,
but A PICTURE OF YOUTH; and regretting
the false light given by the spirit of comparison,
in the hypothesis which he had formed from in∣dividual
experience, acknowlekged its injustice,
its narrowness and its arrogance. What, at last,
so diversified as man? what so little to be judged
by his fellow?</P>
