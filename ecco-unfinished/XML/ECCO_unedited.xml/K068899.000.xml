</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS quotation from a Greek, and consequently a heathen Poet, the eloquent Apostle of the Gentiles conde∣scended to use, when he was endea∣vouring to convert the greatest masters of human wisdom, from the greatest proof of human folly, the worship of idols; when he was asserting the unity of that great first cause, which they so little un∣derstood, as to erect an altar to him un∣der the appellation of <HI>the unknown God</HI>. <Q>This universal source of life, breath, and
<PB N="8" REF="4"/>
all created beings, he declares to them, “made of one blood, all men to dwell on ”the face of the earth," and determined, by his divine Prescience, both the times of their existence, and the bounds of their habitation.</Q></P>
<P>Of these two fundamental truths, upon which not only natural but revealed reli∣gion is founded, the existence of a first cause, and the deduction thence of all created beings, it is clear from the text that the heathens themselves were apprized, tho' they failed to draw from them that consequence, which, of all others, seems the most natural, that created beings, of the same species, must of necessity be, one to another, in a state of equality, and that the human species, in particular, being, as the Apostle phrases it, of the same blood, had all
<PB N="9" REF="5"/>
of them the same pretensions to the equal blessings of nature, being formed by the same hand, and endued with the same faculties for enjoying pleasure, and suffering pain; that though the place or climate in which they happened to be born, and the time of their birth, or, to speak more accurately in the words of St. Paul, "the times which God had appointed them, and the bounds of their habitation" might occasion some acciden∣tal difference as to the cultivation of those faculties, and the modes of those pleasures and pains, yet the original ca∣pacity for all of them was still the same, and that all being alike human creatures, there was neither gift nor faculty bestowed on the nature of huma∣nity that belonged of right more to one than another of the human species.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="6"/>To the divine mission of St. Paul, no∣thing was more necessary than the esta∣blishment of this primary truth; he was the professed apostle of the Gentiles, and under that character had as many preju∣dices to overcome as if, like St. Peter, he had only been the apostle of the Jews and their proselytes. The Jews, deeming themselves the peculiar people of God, we know, had the strongest objection imaginable to a Messiah who was to save or redeem any nation except their own; and the Greeks, who held all nations but theirs to be barbarians, were full as un∣likely to embrace a faith to be held in common, not only with the Jews, but the rest of a barbarous world: The doc∣trine which exhorted all men, wherever situated, to embrace one common salva∣tion, was therefore as little suited to the pretensions of the one as to the pride of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="7"/>But though St. Paul, by proceeding upon this fundamental truth, and thence deducing the doctrine of an universal Redeemer, disseminated the gospel so far, as to make the success of his preach∣ing a miracle almost equal to any per∣formed by his divine master, insomuch that infidelity has been put to its utmost subterfuges to invalidate its force; yet this truth itself, this necessary inference from the gospel, that all men are the offspring of God, was not, either by himself of his suc∣cessors, so far established in a refractory world as to make it an universal rule of mo∣ral action; nay, we have it still to lament that it is as little attended to at this pre∣sent hour, as it was when the apostle first preached it to the Athenians. The distinction between Greek and Barbarian has indeed ceased, or rather names and scenes are shifted, and the Greeks are now
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>
become, in the eyes of the more civilized nations in Europe, themselves barbarians; yet every distinct European state, in pro∣portion as it acquires a real, or even an assumed pretension to superior civiliza∣tion, is too apt to impute to the rest of the world a proportional degree of barba∣rity, and consequently, whatever they may think, they are sometimes inclined to act toward them as if they were not of the same sacred original. Nor is this much to be wondered at, when we re∣flect that the same false notion prevails amongst individuals of the same nation: Every accidental advantage, which either birth, riches, or education gives, becomes nutriment to this over-weening pride, and equally leads the possessors of them to behave to those who want such casual advantages, as if they derived their ex∣istence from two different sources.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="9"/>But there is one enormous prejudice of this kind, which, for a long series of years, has infected the European part of the globe, not only individually but na∣tionally; a prejudice which christianity has almost universally failed to eradicate, I mean that futile, but at the same time horrible, opinion, which, resting itself on argument that can go no deeper than the very surface and tincture of the skin, has led many, who yet call themselve chris∣tians, to treat beings of the same divine origin with themselves, even worse than they think themselves permitted to treat the beasts that perish: Beings that have immortal souls like themselves, enshrined in a body which, tho' it has a variation of complexion, has hardly any in form or in feature. This more than Pagan prejudice I should think myself worthily employed in execrating through the re∣mainder
<PB N="14" REF="10"/>
of this discourse, did I not fore∣see, with heart-felt satisfaction, that wiser and better heads than my own are about to endeavour, by the best and most legal means, at a demolition of the evil, by putting a stop to that merchandize, dreadful term! when employed to signify the traffic which MEN make of MEN, which has so long been the worst of dis∣graces to the name of Christians and of Britons.</P>
<P>But were I to enter the lists against those, and, to the disgrace of the very name of man, some there are who vin∣dicate what they call the SLAVE TRADE, and who, by the very term they use, do enough to make every benevolent breast receive their arguments with detestation, I should think that I profaned the sanctity of this place, that I disgraced the dignity
<PB N="15" REF="11"/>
of my subject, which is no less than the great cause of humanity; I should think that I surrendered the principles of chris∣tianity, if I condescended to answer any of their political reasonings; or even deigned to take into consideration the advantages which accrue from the permission, or the disadvantages which might result from the prohibition of this inhuman barter. Still more should I think that I did dis∣honour to myself, as a preacher of the gospel of Christ, if, with all the insipid coldness of a common moralist, I should for a moment allow the intellectual faculties of the African man to be natu∣rally inferior to those of the European, and then philosophically argue, that as plants may be meliorated and become more vigorous by transplanting them in∣to a richer soil, so it might be possible,
<PB N="16" REF="12"/>
by the culture of education, to improve the intellects even of an African Savage.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the natural inferiority of their understanding makes the Ne∣groes incapable of receiving such culture, will hardly be admitted by any true Christian, who considers that the Apostle Philip was sent, by a di∣vinely appointed messenger, to meet the Ethiopian Eunuch at Gaza in the desert, and there baptize him. (See Acts viii. 26.) We are told here that this personage, the Treasurer of Queen Candace, had before believed in the Divine Unity, and was on his journey to worship at Jerusalem, where he had probably been before admitted by the Jews as a proselyte of the gate. We find too that he was sufficiently skilled in Hebrew literature to read the sublime poetry of Isaiah, and that he was peculiarly chosen of God to be one of the first converts to Chris∣tianity, his conversion being placed in order of time before that of Saul. Such a believer will certainly thence infer, that as God is no respecter of persons, he has made no distinction in his gifts to the Human Species. In prosecuting this disquisition further, men of letters may perhaps be led to investigate an opinion of a very late French writer, M. Vol∣ney, who in his travels into Syria and Egypt (I quote from the Eng∣lish translation of them, Vol. I. Page 81) has, amongst some other historical reasons, adduced a passage from Herodotus, who believes that as the Colchi were an antient colony from Egypt, they were, like the Egyptians, actually Negroes. The words of the Father of History are, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Liber</HI> ii. <HI>cap.</HI> 104. "That, like them, they have black skins and frizzled hair." The reflection which the learned traveller makes on this is so very apposite to the general doctrine of my discourse, that it is on that account I have chiefly quoted it. <Q>“This historical fact affords to philosophy an interesting subject of reflection. How are we astonished when we behold the present barbarism and ignorance of the Copts descended from the profound genius of the Egyptians, and the bril∣liant intelligence of the Greeks; when we reflect that to the race of Negroes, at present our Slaves and the object of our extreme con∣tempt, we owe our Arts, Sciences, and even the very use of Speech; and when we recollect that in the midst of those nations, who call themselves the Friends of Liberty and Humanity, the most bar∣barous of Slaveries is justified, and that it is even a problem whether the understanding of Negroes be of the same species with that of ”White Men!"</Q> P. 83.</P><P>But as the instance of <HI>one</HI> individual is with me, and perhaps will be with the generality of my readers, sufficient to decide on this ques∣tion, let me, lastly, quote the letters of poor Ignatius Sancho, as a sufficient proof not only of African Capacity, but of true humanity. This man received the principal advantages resulting from European culture, in a great family, in which he was many years a menial ser∣vant, but which I should be apt to think not the best school, did I not at the same time reflect that the most noble head of that family must (I speak from knowledge of his innate benevolence) have uniformly set him the best of all examples.—<HI>See the Preface to</HI> Sancho's Letters.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="13"/>Far from myself, far from all who should either write, preach, or think upon the subject with the spirit of those gospels in their minds, be so tame, so unanimated a mode of treating the sub∣ject.
<PB N="18" REF="14"/>
If ever Eloquence was in its place, here might it exert its utmost force, with∣out a fear of misleading Reason, or of acting too powerfully upon the passions. If ever Argumentation, or Logic, can be useless or misapplied, it is here they must be so, because they would be employed in the refutation of self-evident falsehood. If ever the true genius of Christianity, which is then best exerted when it gives glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will towards men, can be urged with superior efficacy to this its twofold purpose, it must be in reprobating a practice which derogates from the glory of that God, and spreads destruction, carnage, and tyranny over a great part of that species of beings born to be ra∣tional, and capable, by good treatment, of being highly so, and which he has dignified with the title of his offspring.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="15"/>But even from the last and best of these assistances, the inspired writings themselves, it seems unnecessary to bor∣row aid on this occasion. Those of my hearers, who are least read in those sacred pages, must have learned from them this plain, yet important truth, that they ought to do to others as they would wish others should do to them; and they must be ignorant indeed if they do not deduce from that divine rule this direct consequence, that as they would not themselves wish to be NEGRO SLAVES, so they ought to wish, and as far as pos∣sible endeavour to free every Negro from the bonds of slavery.</P>
<P>This matter then being so very ob∣vious to every understanding, I will venture to turn my discourse to a topic, from which I conceive it possible, yet
<PB N="20" REF="16"/>
barely possible, that some little preju∣dice may arise against this most be∣nevolent attempt, resulting from the place, time, and persons whence the hu∣mane idea originated. It commenced first, as is well known, in that part of America which was very lately subject to the crown of Great Britain, and soon after the time when its inhabitants ceased to be our fellow-subjects, but not to be our fel∣low-christians. To descend more minutely into particulars (endeavouring at the same time cautiously to avoid any expression that might tend to awaken the least spark of jealousy) it began, I believe, first in the state of Pensylvania, wherein a religious sect had long been established, which, for certain singular notions and habits that they adopted, the dissolute court of Charles the Second had called by an opprobrious name. But whatever might then, or may
<PB N="21" REF="17"/>
now be justly objected to these notions, or to any enthusiastic tenet of theirs, which we hold to be unscriptural, I have yet the boldness to assert, that, as good subjects and good citizens, their conduct has long made them respectable; the discreet management of their own poor has made them an object of emulation. It is true, that the simplicity of their manners, and of their deportment, may incur the con∣tempt of the falsely polite, and the ridi∣cule of frivolous and unfeeling fashion; yet such ridicule and such contempt, I am persuaded, they will contentedly bear, if they can only gain, what is surely their due, that attention to the example they have set, which, despising every idle prejudice, may lead all denomina∣tions of Christians heartily to concur in that righteous cause which they began disinterestedly, have pursued steadily, and
<PB N="22" REF="18"/>
seem to proceed in successfully; inso∣much that, did the sobriety of their sect suffer them to glorify themselves be∣fore men, they might say with honest confidence, <Q>“We are employed on a godly matter, a matter in which he, whom the Papacy has called the Most Chris∣tian, and he whom he has called the Most Catholic King, might be proud to join us. Thou also of all others mightest be proud to join us, who, inhe∣riting by succession that title of Defen∣der of the Faith, which the same spirit of Antichrist first conferred on a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Henry VIII. to whom Pope Leo X. gave this title as a reward for a defence of the Papal Power and Tenets which the king had written against Luther.</NOTE>tyrant, holdest it now by the best of all human charters, the united suffrages of a free ”and a protestant people."</Q> Thus might these plain men express a bold, but at
<PB N="23" REF="19"/>
the same time a most just sentiment; and there is no doubt but that one of these Monarchs would, if directed only by the dictates of his own heart, be ready to join them. But the wisdom of our constitution, by setting limits to his power, has, in this peculiar case, set limits to his humanity. He cannot, and, I trust, he would not wish to say <Q>“I will by my own individual authority put an absolute ”prohibition on this unchristian traffic."</Q> <Q>But he might and would justly say, “to the petitions of my people, I will lend a ready ear; to the determinations of my ”parliament I will afford a joyful sanction."</Q> May he not be deprived of that joy! for who but the King of a free, as well as a Protestant nation, should have the glory of leading the other Potentates of Europe on so godlike an enterprize. May he not be deprived of that glory! May
<PB N="24" REF="20"/>
the voice of his parliament be unanimous in the cause; in that cause may the pe∣titions of his people be strenuous, urgent, and universal.</P>
<P>To the universality of such peti∣tions I have the pleasure to find that the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor of this ancient city, and the worshipful the Aldermen have, like some other cor∣porate bodies in the kingdom, judiciously contributed their assistance; and hence it is reasonably to be inferred, that the gentry, clergy, and all other its inhabitants will follow their laudable example. But <HI>laudable</HI> is too feeble an epithet on this occasion, it is moral Patriotism! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This epithet is somewhat <HI>hazarded</HI>; I would be understood to mean by it, that as patriotism itself only signifies the love of our country, so with this addition, the term indicates a love of mankind under the idea of <HI>one common family</HI>. Natural religion teaches this, but revelation goes farther, it bids to love and do good to all men as <HI>brethren</HI>; to endeavour therefore to give Slaves Freedom, because they are our <HI>brethren</HI>, I denominate Christian Heroism. Revelation goes farther still, and considers Christians, one with another, as links or members of one body, the head of which is Christ the Lord. <HI>See Ephes. passim.</HI></NOTE> it is Christian Heroism!</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="21"/>Having said this, I have only to apologize for myself on having addrest you so long, in a stile and manner somewhat unusual in discourses from this place. Let the peculiarity, as well as the importance of the subject plead my excuse. But if the manner in which I have treated it, should not be thought improper; if it should only be thought well intended, let me have reason to hope that what I have said may, when this great question comes before the parliament, induce my present audience to join in the public prayer of our church with peculiar fervour, that Almighty God "would be pleased to direct and prosper all their consultations to the advancement of his glory, the good of his church, the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and

his kingdoms:" For what can be more for the advancement of God's glory than the emancipation of whole nations from the worst of slavery? What more for the good of his church, than the almost certain intro∣duction of innumerable tribes of free men, then only capable of becoming good and practical Christians, into its sacred pale.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To prove this assertion fully would require a separate dis∣course. So far as civilization is concerned in the question, it has been well discussed by the masterly pen of a Warburton, in a sermon delivered to the society for propagating the gospel in foreign parts, 1766. But as nothing resembles the fate of the leaves of the Sibyls so much as sermons printed singly, I have not been able in this place to procure a copy of it in due time. I wish however to refer my readers to a very curious letter from the Indians in the back settlements of America, printed by the Society in the account of their proceeding that same year. In that letter the Savages, in their rude yet energetic manner, request Engli.. working tools as well as English missionaries to be sent to them. Hence, as I remember, the learned Bishop very sagely insers, that civilization should always either precede or accompany conversion.</P><P>How much the benevolent intention of the Society above-mentioned has been impeded, if not absolutely prevented, not only by the <HI>Slave-seller</HI> but the <HI>Slave-buyer</HI>, may be gathered from a most judicious discourse of the present Bishop of Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gor, preached before that Society last year, which I earnestly recommend to the reader, as he will there find arguments against the Slave-Trade, which will make him ample amends for any deficiency of them in these few and hastily-written pages.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="27" REF="25"/>
What more for the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and his king∣doms, than the utter abolition of that execrable commerce, which has been so long the disgrace of every king, of every nation that have permitted it: A com∣merce, which, if longer persisted in, may draw down the vengeance of an offended God to visit, not only Great Britain, but all Europe, with every cala∣mity which they justly deserve who even connive at the destruction, or permit the captivity, of HIS OFFSPRING.</P>
