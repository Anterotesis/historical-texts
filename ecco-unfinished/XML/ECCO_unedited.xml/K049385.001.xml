<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne sur mer, <DATE>June 23, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU laid your commands upon me at
parting, to communicate from time
to time the observations I should
make in the course of my travels, and it
was an injunction I received with pleasure.
In gratifying your curiosity, I shall find some
amusement to beguile the tedious hours, which,
without some such employment, would be
rendered insupportable by distemper and dis∣quiet.</P>
<P>You knew, and pitied my situation, tra∣duced
by malice, persecuted by faction, aban∣doned
by false patrons, and overwhelmed by the
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
sense of a domestic calamity, which it was
not in the power of fortune to repair.</P>
<P>You know with what eagerness I fled from
my country as a scene of illiberal dispute, and
incredible infatuation, where a few worthless
incendiaries had, by dint of perfidious calum∣nies
and atrocious abuse, kindled up a flame
which threatened all the horrors of civil dis∣sension.</P>
<P>I packed up my little family in a hired
coach, and attended by my trusty servant,
who had lived with me a dozen of years, and
now refused to leave me, took the road to Do∣ver,
in my way to the South of France, where
I hoped the mildness of the climate would
prove favourable to the weak state of my lungs.</P>
<P>You advised me to have recourse again to
the Bath waters, from the use of which I had
received great benefit the preceding winter:
but I had many inducements to leave Eng∣land.
My wife earnestly begged I would con∣vey
her from a country where every object
served to nourish her grief: I was in hopes that
a succession of new scenes would engage her
attention, and gradually call off her mind from
a series of painful reflections; and I imagined
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
the change of air, and a journey of near a
thousand miles, would have a happy effect
upon my own constitution. But, as the sum∣mer
was already advanced, and the heat too
excessive for travelling in warm climates, I
proposed staying at Boulogne till the begin∣ning
of autumn, and in the mean time to
bathe in the sea, with a view to strengthen
and prepare my body for the fatigues of such
a long journey.</P>
<P>A man who travels with a family of five
persons, must lay his account with a number
of mortifications; and some of these I have
already happily overcome. Though I was
well acquainted with the road to Dover, and
made allowances accordingly, I could not help
being chagrined at the bad accommodation
and impudent imposition to which I was ex∣posed.
These I found the more disagreeable,
as we were detained a day extraordinary on
the road, in consequence of my wife's be∣ing
indisposed.</P>
<P>I need not tell you this is the worst road in
England, with respect to the conveniencies of
travelling, and must certainly impress foreign∣ers
with an unfavourable opinion of the nation
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
in general. The chambers are in general cold
and comfortless, the beds paultry, the cookery
execrable, the wine poison, the attendance
bad, the publicans insolent, and the bills ex∣tortion;
there is not a drop of tolerable malt
liquor to be had from London to Dover.</P>
<P>Every landlord and every waiter harangued
upon the knavery of a publican in Canter∣bury,
who had charged the French ambassador
forty pounds for a supper that was not worth
forty shillings. They talked much of ho∣nesty
and conscience; but when they pro∣duced
their own bills, they appeared to be
all of the same family and complexion. If
it was a reproach upon the English nation, that
an innkeeper should pillage strangers at that
rate; it is a greater scandal, that the same fel∣low
should be able to keep his house still o∣pen.
I own, I think it would be for the ho∣nour
of the kingdom to reform the abuses of
this road; and in particular to improve the
avenue to London by the way of Kent-Street,
which is a most disgraceful entrance to such
an opulent city. A foreigner, in passing
through this beggarly and ruinous suburb,
conceives such an idea of misery and mean∣ness,
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
as all the wealth and magnificence of
London and Westminster are afterwards un∣able
to destroy. A friend of mine, who brought
a Parisian from Dover in his own post-chaise,
contrived to enter Southwark after it was dark,
that his friend might not perceive the naked∣ness
of this quarter. The stranger was much
pleased with the great number of shops full of
merchandize, lighted up to the best advantage.
He was astonished at the display of riches in
Lombard-Street and Cheapside. The badness
of the pavement made him find the streets twice
as long as they were. They alighted in Upper
Brook-Street by Grosvenor-Square; and when
his conductor told him they were then about
the middle of London, the Frenchman de∣clared,
with marks of infinite surprize, that
London was very near as long as Paris.</P>
<P>On my arrival at Dover I payed off my
coachman, who went away with a heavy heart.
He wanted much to cross the sea, and endea∣voured
to persuade me to carry the coach and
horses to the other side. If I had been re∣solved
to set out immediately for the South,
perhaps I should have taken his advice. If
I had retained him at the rate of twenty
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
guineas per month, which was the price he
demanded, and begun my journey without
hesitation, I should travel more agreeably
than I can expect to do in the carriages of
this country; and the difference of the ex∣pence
would be a meer trifle. I would ad∣vise
every man who travels through France to
bring his own vehicle along with him, or at
least to purchase one at Calais or Boulogne,
where second-hand berlins and chaises may
be generally had at reasonable rates. I have
been offered a very good berlin for thirty gui∣neas:
but before I make the purchase, I must
be better informed touching the different me∣thods
of travelling in this country.</P>
<P>Dover is commonly termed a den of thieves;
and I am afraid it is not altogether without
reason, it has acquired this appellation. The
people are said to live by piracy in time of
war; and by smuggling and fleecing strangers
in time of peace: but I will do them the
justice to say, they make no distinction be∣tween
foreigners and natives. Without all
doubt a man cannot be much worse lodged
and worse treated in any part of Europe;
nor will he in any other place meet with more
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
flagrant instances of fraud, imposition, and
brutality. One would imagine they had form∣ed
a general conspiracy against all those who
either go to, or return from the continent.
About five years ago, in my passage from
Flushing to Dover, the master of the packet-boat
brought to all of a sudden off the South
Foreland, although the wind was as favour∣able
as it could blow. He was immediately
boarded by a custom-house boat, the officer
of which appeared to be his friend. He then
gave the passengers to understand, that as it
was low water, the ship could not go into
the harbour; but that the boat would carry
them ashore with their baggage.</P>
<P>The custom-house officer demanded a gui∣nea
for this service, and the bargain was made.
Before we quitted the ship, we were obliged
to gratify the cabin-boy for his attendance,
and to give drink-money to the sailors. The
boat was run aground on the open beach;
but we could not get ashore without the as∣sistance
of three or four fellows, who insisted
upon being paid for their trouble. Every
parcel and bundle, as it was landed, was
snatched up by a separate porter: one ran
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
away with a hat-box, another with a wig-box,
a third with a couple of shirts tied up
in a handkerchief, and two were employed in
carrying a small portmanteau that did not
weigh forty pounds. All our things were
hurried to the custom-house to be searched,
and the searcher was paid for disordering our
cloaths: from thence they were removed to
the inn, where the porters demanded half a
crown each for their labour. It was in vain
to expostulate; they surrounded the house like
a pack of hungry hounds, and raised such
a clamour, that we were fain to comply. Af∣ter
we had undergone all this imposition, we
were visited by the master of the packet, who,
having taken our fares, and wished us joy of
our happy arrival in England, expressed his
hope that we would remember the poor mas∣ter,
whose wages were very small, and who
chiefly depended upon the generosity of the
passengers. I own I was shocked at his mean∣ness,
and could not help telling him so. I told
him, I could not conceive what title he had
to any such gratification: he had sixteen pas∣sengers,
who paid a guinea each, on the
supposition that every person should have a
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
bed; but there were no more than eight beds
in the cabin, and each of these was occupied
before I came on board; so that if we had
been detained at sea a whole week by con∣trary
winds and bad weather, one half of the
passengers must have slept upon the boards,
howsoever their health might have suffered
from this want of accommodation. Not∣withstanding
this check, he was so very ab∣ject
and importunate, that we gave him a
crown a piece, and he retired.</P>
<P>The first thing I did when I arrived at Do∣ver
this last time, was to send for the master
of a packet-boat, and agree with him to
carry us to Boulogne at once, by which means
I saved the expence of travelling by land from
Calais to this last place, a journey of four-and-twenty
miles. The hire of a vessel from
Dover to Boulogne is precisely the same as
from Dover to Calais, five guineas; but this
skipper demanded eight, and, as I did not
know the fare, I agreed to give him six.
We embarked between six and seven in the
evening, and found ourselves in a most
wretched hovel, on board what is called a
Folkstone cutter. The cabin was so small
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
that a dog could hardly turn in it, and the
beds put me in mind of the holes described
in some catacombs, in which the bodies of
the dead were deposited, being thrust in with
the feet foremost; there was no getting into
them but end-ways, and indeed they seemed
so dirty, that nothing but extreme necessity
could have obliged me to use them. We sat
up all night in a most uncomfortable situati∣on,
tossed about by the sea, cold, and cramped
and weary, and languishing for want of sleep.
At three in the morning the master came
down, and told us we were just off the har∣bour
of Boulogne; but the wind blowing
off shore, he could not possibly enter, and
therefore advised us to go ashore in the
boat. I went upon deck to view the coast,
when he pointed to the place where he said
Boulogne stood, declaring at the same time we
were within a short mile of the harbour's
mouth. The morning was cold and raw,
and I knew myself extremely subject to catch
cold; nevertheless we were all so impatient
to be ashore, that I resolved to take his advice.
The boat was already hoisted out, and we
went on board of it, after I had paid the
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
captain and gratified his crew. We had scarce
parted from the ship, when we perceived a
boat coming towards us from the shore; and
the master gave us to understand, it was
coming to carry us into the harbour. When
I objected to the trouble of shifting from one
boat to another in the open sea, which (by
the bye) was a little rough; he said it was a
privilege which the watermen of Boulogne
had, to carry all passengers ashore, and that
this privilege he durst not venture to infringe.
This was no time nor place to remonstrate.
The French boat came alongside half filled
with water, and we were handed from the
one to the other. We were then obliged to
lie upon our oars, till the captain's boat
went on board and returned from the ship
with a packet of letters. We were after∣wards
rowed a long league, in a rough sea,
against wind and tide, before we reached the
harbour, where we landed, benumbed with
cold, and the women excessively sick: from
our landing-place we were obliged to walk ve∣ry
near a mile to the inn where we purposed
to lodge, attended by six or seven men and
women, bare-legged, carrying our baggage.
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
This boat cost me a guinea, besides paying
exorbitantly the people who carried our things;
so that the inhabitants of Dover and of Bou∣logne
seem to be of the same kidney, and in∣deed
they understand one another perfectly
well. It was our honest captain who made
the signal for the shore-boat before I went
upon deck; by which means he not only gra∣tified
his friends, the watermen of Boulogne,
but also saved about fifteen shillings portage,
which he must have paid had he gone into
the harbour; and thus he found himself at
liberty to return to Dover, which he reached
in four hours. I mention these circumstances
as a warning to other passengers. When a
man hires a packet-boat from Dover to Ca∣lais
or Boulogne, let him remember that the
stated price is five guineas; and let him in∣sist
upon being carried into the harbour in the
ship, without paying the least regard to the
representations of the master, who is gene∣rally
a little dirty knave. When he tells you
it is low water, or the wind is in your teeth,
you may say you will stay on board till it is
high water, or till the wind comes favourable.
If he sees you are resolute, he will find means
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
to bring his ship into the harbour, or at
least to convince you, without a possibility of
your being deceived, that it is not in his
power. After all, the fellow himself was a loser
by his finesse; if he had gone into the har∣bour,
he would have had another fare im∣mediately
back to Dover, for there was a
Scotch gentleman at the inn waiting for such
an opportunity.</P>
<P>Knowing my own weak constitution, I took
it for granted this morning's adventure would
cost me a fit of illness; and what added to
my chagrin, when we arrived at the inn, all
the beds were occupied; so that we were o∣bliged
to sit in a cold kitchen above two hours,
until some of the lodgers should get up. This
was such a bad specimen of French accom∣modation,
that my wife could not help re∣gretting
even the inns of Rochester, Sitting∣bourn,
and Canterbury: bad as they are, they
certainly have the advantage, when compared
with the execrable auberges of this country,
where one finds nothing but dirt and impo∣sition.
One would imagine the French were
still at war with the English, for they pillage
them without mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16"/>
Among the strangers at this inn where we
lodged, there was a gentleman of the faculty,
just returned from Italy. Understanding that
I intended to winter in the South of France,
on account of a pulmonic disorder, he strongly
recommended the climate of Nice in Pro∣vence,
which, indeed, I had often heard ex∣tolled;
and I am almost resolved to go thither,
not only for the sake of the air, but also for
its situation on the Mediterranean, where I
can have the benefit of bathing; and from
whence there is a short cut by sea to Italy,
should I find it necessary to try the air of
Naples.</P>
<P>After having been ill accommodated three
days at our inn, we have at last found com∣modious
lodgings, by means of Mrs. B—, a
very agreeable French lady, to whom we were
recommended by her husband, who is my
countryman, and at present resident in Lon∣don.
For three guineas a month we have the
greatest part of a house tolerably furnished;
four bed-chambers on the first floor, a large
parlour below, a kitchen, and the use of a
cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17"/>
These, I own, are frivolous incidents, scarce
worth committing to paper; but they may
serve to introduce observations of more con∣sequence;
and in the mean time I know no∣thing
will be indifferent to you, that concerns</P>
<CLOSER>Your humble servant.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne sur mer, <DATE>July 15, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE custom-house officers at Boulogne,
though as alert, are rather more civil
than those on your side of the water. I brought
no plate along with me, but a dozen and a half
of spoons, and a dozen teaspoons: the first
being found in one of our portmanteaus, when
they were examined at the bureau, cost me
seventeen livres <HI>entrée:</HI> the others being luckily
in my servant's pocket, escaped duty free. All
wrought silver imported into France, pays at
the rate of so much per mark: therefore
those who have any quantity of plate, will
do well to leave it behind them, unless they
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
can confide in the dexterity of the ship∣masters;
some of whom will undertake to
land it without the ceremony of examination.
The ordonnances of France are so unfavour∣able
to strangers, that they oblige them to
pay at the rate of five per cent. for all the
bed and table linen which they bring into
the kingdom, even though it has been used.
When my trunks arrived in a ship from the
river Thames, I underwent this ordeal: but
what gives me more vexation, my books have
been stopped at the bureau; and will be sent
to Amiens at my expence, to be examined by
the <HI>chambere syndicale;</HI> lest they should con∣tain
something prejudicial to the state, or to
the religion of the country. This is a species
of oppression which one would not expect
to meet with in France, which piques itself
on its politeness and hospitality: but the
truth is, I know no country in which stran∣gers
are worse treated, with respect to their
essential concerns. If a foreigner dies in
France, the king seizes all his effects, even
though his heir should be upon the spot; and
this tyranny is called the <HI>droit d'aubaine</HI>
founded at first upon the supposition, that
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
all the estate of foreigners residing in France
was acquired in that kingdom, and that,
therefore, it would be unjust to convey it
to another country. If an English protestant
goes to France for the benefit of his health,
attended by his wife or his son, or both, and
dies with effects in the house to the amount
of a thousand guineas, the king seizes the
whole, the family is left destitute, and the
body of the deceased is denied christian burial.
The Swiss, by capitulation, are exempted
from this despotism, and so are the Scots, in
consequence of an ancient alliance between
the two nations. The same <HI>droit d'aubaine</HI> is
exacted by some of the princes in Germany:
but it is a great discouragement to commerce,
and prejudices every country where it is ex∣ercised,
to ten times the value of what it
brings into the coffers of the sovereign.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly mortified at the detention
of my books, which not only deprives me of
an amusement which I can very ill dispense
with; but, in all probability, will expose me
to sundry other inconveniencies. I must be
at the expence of sending them sixty miles
to be examined, and run the risque of their
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
being condemned; and, in the mean time,
I may lose the opportunity of sending them
with my heavy baggage by sea to Bourdeaux,
to be sent up the Garonne to Tholouse, and
from thence transmitted through the canal
of Languedoc to Cette, which is a sea-port on
the Mediterranean, about three or four leagues
from Montpelier.</P>
<P>For the recovery of my books, I had recourse
to the advice of my landlord, Mons. B—.
He is a handsome young fellow, about twenty-five
years of age, and keeps house with two
maiden sisters, who are professed devotees.
The brother is a little libertine, good na∣tured
and obliging; but a true Frenchman
in vanity, which is undoubtedly the ruling
passion of this volatile people. He has an
inconsiderable place under the government,
in consequence of which he is permitted to
wear a sword, a privilege which he does not
fail to use. He is likewise receiver of the
tythes of the clergy in this district, an office
that gives him a command of money, and he,
moreover, deals in the wine trade. When I
came to his house, he made a parade of all
these advantages: he displayed his bags of
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
money, and some old gold which his father
had left him. He described his chateau in
the country; dropped hints of the fortunes
that were settled upon mademoiselles his sis∣ters;
boasted of his connexions at court; and
assured me it was not for my money that he
let his lodgings, but altogether with a view
to enjoy the pleasure of my company. The
truth, when stript of all embellishments, is
this: the sieur B—is the son of an honest
bourgeois lately dead, who left him the house,
with some stock in trade, a little money, and
a paltry farm: his sisters have about three
thousand livres (not quite 140 l.) a-piece;
the brother's places are worth about fifty
pounds a year, and his connexions at court
are confined to a commis or clerk in the
secretary's office, with whom he corresponds
by virtue of his employment. My landlord
piques himself upon his gallantry and suc∣cess
with the fair-sex: he keeps a <HI>fille de joye,</HI>
and makes no secret of his amours. He
told miss C—the other day, in broken Eng∣lish,
that, in the course of the last year, he
had made six bastards. He owned, at the same
time, he had sent them all to the hospital;
<PB N="20" REF="22"/>
but, now his father is dead, he would him∣self
take care of his future productions. This,
however, was no better than a gasconade.—
Yesterday the house was in a hot alarm, on
account of a new windfall of this kind: the
sisters were in tears; the brother was visited
by the <HI>curé</HI> of the parish; the lady in the
straw (a sempstress) sent him the bantling
in a basket, and he transmitted it by the
carriers to the <HI>Enfans trouvés</HI> at Paris.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression: Mr.
B—advised me to send a <HI>requéte</HI> or petition
to the chancellor of France, that I might ob∣tain
an order to have my books examined
on the spot, by the president of Boulogne,
or the <HI>procureur du roy,</HI> or the subdelegate
of the intendance. He recommended an
<HI>avocat</HI> of his acquaintance to draw up the
<HI>memoire,</HI> and introduced him accordingly;
telling me at the same time, in private, that
if he was not a drunkard, he would be at the
head of his profession. He had indeed all
the outward signs of a sot; a sleepy eye, a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubicund face, and carbuncled nose. He
seemed to be a little out at elbows, had mar∣vellous
foul linen, and his breeches were
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
not very sound: but he assumed an air of
importance, was very courteous, and very
solemn. I asked him if he did not some∣times
divert himself with the muse: he smiled,
and promised, in a whisper, to shew me
some <HI>chansonettes de sa façon.</HI> Meanwhile he
composed the <HI>requete</HI> in my name, which was
very pompous, very tedious, and very abject.
Such a stile might perhaps be necessary in a
native of France; but I did not think it was
at all suitable to a subject of Great-Britain.
I thanked him for the trouble he had taken,
as he would receive no other gratification;
but when my landlord proposed to send the
<HI>memoire</HI> to his correspondent at Paris, to be
delivered to the chancellor, I told him I had
changed my mind, and would apply to the
English ambassador. I have accordingly taken
the liberty to address myself to the earl of
H—; and at the same time I have presumed
to write to the duchess of D—, who
is now at Paris, to entreat her grace's advice
and interposition. What effect these appli∣cations
may have, I know not: but the sieur
B—shakes his head, and has told my ser∣vant,
in confidence, that I am mistaken if I
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
think the English ambassador is as great
man at Paris as the chancellor of France.</P>
<P>I ought to make an apology for troubling
you with such an unentertaining detail, and
consider that the detention of my books must
be a matter of very little consequence to any
body, but to</P>
<CLOSER>Your affectionate humble servant.</CLOSER>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>August 15, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am much obliged to you for your kind
enquiries after my health, which has
been lately in a very declining condition.
In consequence of a cold, caught a few days
after my arrival in France, I was seized with
a violent cough, attended with a fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and
stitches in my breast, which tormented me all
night long without ceasing. At the same time
I had a great discharge by expectoration, and
such a dejection of spirits as I never felt be∣fore.
In this situation I took a step which
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
may appear to have been desperate. I knew there
was no imposthume in my lungs, and I supposed
the stitches were spasmodical. I was sensible
that all my complaints were originally derived
from relaxation. I therefore hired a chaise,
and going to the beach, about a league from
the town, plunged into the sea without hesi∣tation.
By this desperate remedy, I got a
fresh cold in my head: but my stitches and
fever vanished the very first day; and by a
daily repetition of the bath, I have diminished
my cough, strengthened my body, and
recovered my spirits. I believe I should have
tried the same experiment, even if there had
been an abscess in my lungs, though such
practice would have been contrary to all the
rules of medicine: but I am not one of
those who implicity believe in all the dog∣mata
of physic. I saw one of the guides at
Bath, the stoutest fellow among them, who
recovered from the last stage of a consump∣tion,
by going into the king's bath, contrary
to the express injunction of his doctor. He
said, if he must die, the sooner the better,
as he had nothing left for his subsistance.
Instead of immediate death, he found instant
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
ease, and continued mending every day, till
his health was entirely re-established. I my∣self
drank the waters at Bath, and bathed,
in diametrical opposition to the opinion of
some physicians there settled, and found myself
better every day, notwithstanding their un∣favourable
prognostic. If I had been of the
rigid fibre, full of blood, subject to inflam∣mation,
I should have followed a different
course. Our acquaintance, doctor C—,
while he actually spit up matter, and rode
out every day for his life, led his horse to
water, at the pond in Hyde-Park, one cold
frosty morning, and the beast, which hap∣pened
to be of a hot constitution, plunged
himself and his master over head and ears in
the water. The poor doctor hastened home,
half dead with fear, and was put to bed in
the apprehension of a new imposthume; in∣stead
of which, he found himself exceedingly
recruited in his spirits, and his appetite much
mended. I advised him to take the hint,
and go into the cold bath every morning:
but he did not chuse to run any risque. How
cold water comes to be such a bugbear, I know
not: if I am not mistaken, Hippocrates re∣commends
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
immersion in cold water for the
gout; and Celsus expressly says, <HI>in omni tussi
utilis est natatio.</HI></P>
<P>I have conversed with a physician of this
place, a sensible man, who assured me he was
reduced to meer skin and bone by a cough
and hectic fever, when he ordered a bath to
be made in his own house, and dipped him∣self
in cold water every morning. He at the
same time left off drinking and swallowing
any liquid that was warm. He is now strong
and lusty, and even in winter has no other
cover than a single sheet. His notions about
the warm drink were a little whimsical: he
imagined it relaxed the tone of the stomach;
and this would undoubtedly be the case if it
was drank in large quantities, warmer than
the natural temperature of the blood. He
alledged the example of the inhabitants of
the Ladrone islands, who never taste any
thing that is not cold, and are remarkably
healthy. But to balance this argument I
mentioned the Chinese, who scarce drink
any thing but warm tea; and the Lap∣landers,
who drink nothing but warm water;
yet the people of both these nations
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
are remarkably strong, healthy, and long-lived.</P>
<P>You desire to know the fate of my books.
My lord H—d is not yet come to France;
but my letter was transmitted to him from
Paris; and his lordship, with that generous
humanity which is peculiar to his charac∣ter,
has done me the honour to assure me,
under his own hand, that he has directed
Mr. N—lle, our resident at Paris, to apply
for an order that my books may be restored.</P>
<P>I have met with another piece of good
fortune, in being introduced to general Pa∣terson
and his lady, in their way to Eng∣land
from Nice, where the general has been
many years commandant for the king of Sar∣dinia.
You must have heard of this gentle∣man,
who has not only eminently distin∣guished
himself, by his courage and conduct
as an officer; but also by his probity and
humanity in the exercise of his office, and
by his remarkable hospitality to all strangers,
especially the subjects of Great-Britain, whose
occasions called them to the place where he
commanded. Being pretty far advanced in
years, he begged leave to resign, that he
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
might spend the evening of his days in his
own country; and his Sardinian majesty
granted his request with regret, after having
honoured him with very particular marks of
approbation and esteem. The general talks
so favourably of the climate of Nice, with
respect to disorders of the breast, that I am
now determined to go thither. It would
have been happy for me had he continued in
his government. I think myself still very
fortunate, in having obtained of him a let∣ter
of recommendation to the English consul
at Nice, together with directions how to tra∣vel
through the South of France. I propose
to begin my journey some time next month,
when the weather will be temperate to the
southward; and in the wine countries I shall
have the pleasure of seeing the vintage, which
is always a season of festivity among all ranks
of people.</P>
<P>You have been very much mis-informed,
by the person who compared Boulogne to
Wapping: he did a manifest injustice to this
place, which is a large agreeable town, with
broad open streets, excellently paved; and
the houses are of stone, well built and com∣modious.
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
The number of inhabitants may
amount to sixteen thousand. You know this
was generally supposed to be the <HI>portus Itius,</HI>
and <HI>Gessoriacum</HI> of the antients: though it
is now believed that the <HI>portus Itius,</HI> from
whence Caesar sailed to Britain, is a place
called <HI>Whitsand,</HI> about half way between this
place and Calais. Boulogne is the capital of the
Boulonnois, a district extending about twelve
leagues, ruled by a governor independent of
the governor of Picardy; of which province,
however, this country forms a part. The
present governor is the duc d'Aumont. The
town of Boulogne is the see of a bishop suf∣fragan
of Rheims, whose revenue amounts
to about four-and-twenty thousand livres, or
one thousand pounds sterling. It is also the
seat of a seneschal's court, from whence an
appeal lies to the parliament of Paris; and
thither all condemned criminals are sent, to
have their sentence confirmed or reversed.
Here is likewise a bailiwick, and a court of
admiralty. The military jurisdiction of the
city belongs to a commandant appointed by
the king, a sort of sinecure bestowed upon
some old officer. His appointments are very
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
inconsiderable: he resides in the Upper Town,
and his garrison at present consists of a few
hundreds of invalids.</P>
<P>Boulogne is divided into the Upper and
Lower Towns. The former is a kind of ci∣tadel,
about a short mile in circumference,
situated on a rising ground, surrounded by a
high wall and rampart, planted with rows
of trees, which form a delightful walk. It
commands a fine view of the country and
Lower Town; and in clear weather the coast
of England, from Dover to Folkstone, ap∣pears
so plain, that one would imagine it
was within four or five leagues of the French
shore. The Upper Town was formerly for∣tified
with outworks, which are now in ru∣ins.
Here is a square, a town-house, the
cathedral, and two or three convents of nuns;
in one of which there are several English
girls, sent hither for their education. The
smallness of the expence encourages parents
to send their children abroad to these semina∣ries,
where they learn scarce any thing that
is useful, but the French language; but they
never fail to imbibe prejudices against the
protestant religion, and generally return en∣thusiastic
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
converts to the religion of Rome.
This conversion always generates a contempt
for, and often an aversion to, their own
country. Indeed it cannot reasonably be ex∣pected,
that people of weak minds, addict∣ed
to superstition, should either love or esteem
those whom they are taught to consider as
reprobated heretics. Ten pounds a year is
the usual pension in these convents; but I
have been informed by a French lady, who
had her education in one of them, that no∣thing
can be more wretched than their en∣tertainment.</P>
<P>The civil magistracy of Boulogne consists
of a mayor and echevins; and this is the
case in almost all the towns of France.</P>
<P>The Lower Town is continued from the gate
of the Upper Town, down the slope of a hill,
as far as the harbour, stretching on both
sides to a large extent, and is much more
considerable than the Upper, with respect to
the beauty of the streets, the convenience of
the houses, and the number and wealth of
the inhabitants. These, however, are all
merchants, or bourgeois; for the noblesse o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
gentry live all together in the Upper Town
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
and never mix with the others. The har∣bour
of Boulogne is at the mouth of the
small river, or rather rivulet Liane, which is
so shallow, that the children wade through
it at low water. As the tide makes, the sea
flows in, and forms a pretty extensive har∣bour,
which, however, admits nothing but
small vessels. It is contracted at the mouth by
two stone <HI>jetties</HI> or piers, which seem to have
been constructed by some engineer, very little
acquainted with this branch of his profession;
for they are carried out in such a manner, as
to collect a bank of sand just at the entrance
of the harbour. The road is very open and
unsafe, and the surf very high when the
wind blows from the sea. There is no forti∣fication
near the harbour, except a paltry fort
mounting about twenty guns, built in the
last war by the prince de Cruy, upon a rock
about a league to the eastward of Boulogne.
It appears to be situated in such a manner,
that it can neither offend, nor be offended.
If the depth of water would admit a forty
or fifty gun ship to lie within cannon-shot of
it, I apprehend it might be silenced in half
an hour; but, in all probability, there will
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
be no vestiges of it at the next rupture be∣tween
the two crowns. It is surrounded every
day by the sea, at high water; and when it
blows a fresh gale towards the shore, the waves
break over the top of it, to the terror and
astonishment of the garrison, who have been
often heard crying piteously for assistance. I
am persuaded, that it will one day disappear
in the twinkling of an eye. The neighbour∣hood
of this fort, which is a smooth sandy
beach, I have chosen for my bathing place.
The road to it is agreeable and romantic,
lying through pleasant corn-fields, skirted by
open downs, where there is a rabbit warren,
and great plenty of the birds so much ad∣mired
at Tunbridge under the name of <HI>wheat∣ears.</HI>
By the bye, this is a pleasant corrup∣tion
of <HI>white-a—se,</HI> the translation of their
French name <HI>cul-blanc,</HI> taken from their co∣lour;
for they are actually white towards
the tail.</P>
<P>Upon the top of a high rock, which over∣looks
the harbour, are the remains of an old
fortification, which is indiscriminately called,
<HI>Tour d'ordre,</HI> and <HI>Julius Caesar's fort.</HI> The
original tower was a light-house built by
<PB N="33" REF="35"/>
<HI>Claudius Caesar,</HI> denominated <HI>Turris ardens,</HI>
from the fire burned in it; and this the French
have corrupted into <HI>Tour d'ordre:</HI> but no ves∣tiges
of this Roman work remain; what we
now see, are the ruins of a castle built by
Charlemagne. I know of no other anti∣quity
at Boulogne, except an old vault in
the Upper Town, now used as a magazine,
which is said to be part of an antient temple
dedicated to Isis.</P>
<P>On the other side of the harbour, oppo∣site
to the Lower Town, there is a house built,
at a considerable expence, by a general offi∣cer,
who lost his life in the late war. Never
was situation more inconvenient, unpleasant,
and unhealthy. It stands on the edge of an
ugly morass formed by the stagnant water
left by the tide in its retreat: the very walks
of the garden are so moist, that, in the driest
weather, no person can make a tour of it,
without danger of the rheumatism. Besides,
the house is altogether inaccessible, except at
low water, and even then the carriage must
cross the harbour, the wheels up to the axle-tree
in mud: nay, the tide rushes in so fast,
that unless you seize the time to a minute,
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
you will be in danger of perishing. The
apartments of this house are elegantly fitted
up, but very small; and the garden, not∣withstanding
its unfavourable situation, af∣fords
a great quantity of good fruit. The
ooze, impregnated with sea salt, produces, on
this side of the harbour, an incredible quan∣tity
of the finest <HI>samphire</HI> I ever saw. The
French call it <HI>pass-pierre;</HI> and I suspect its
English name is a corruption of <HI>sang-pierre.</HI>
It is generally found on the faces of bare
rocks that overhang the sea, by the spray of
which it is nourished. As it grew upon a
naked rock, without any appearance of soil,
it might be naturally enough called <HI>sang du
pierre,</HI> or <HI>sang-pierre,</HI> blood of the rock;
and hence the name <HI>samphire.</HI> On the same
side of the harbour there is another new house,
neatly built, belonging to a gentleman who
has obtained a grant from the king of some
ground which was always overflowed at high
water. He has raised dykes at a consider∣able
expence, to exclude the tide, and if he
can bring his project to bear, he will not only
gain a good estate for himself, but also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the harbour, by increasing the depth at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh-water.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37"/>
In the Lower Town of Boulogne there are
several religious houses, particularly a semi∣nary,
a convent of Cordeliers, and another
of Capuchins. This last, having fallen to de∣cay,
was some years ago repaired, chiefly by
the charity of British travellers, collected by
father Graeme, a native of North-Britain,
who had been an officer in the army of king
James II. and is said to have turned monk
of this mendicant order, by way of volun∣tary
penance, for having killed his friend in
a duel. Be that as it may, he was a well-bred,
sensible man, of a very exemplary life and
conversation; and his memory is much re∣vered
in this place. Being superior of the
convent, he caused the British arms to be
put up in the church, as a mark of gratitude
for the benefactions received from our na∣tion.
I often walk in the garden of the
convent, the walls of which are washed by
the sea at high-water. At the bottom of the
garden is a little private grove, separated from
it by a high wall, with a door of communica∣tion;
and hither the Capuchins retire, when
they are disposed for contemplation. About
two years ago, this place was said to be con∣verted
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
to a very different use. There was among
the monks one <HI>pere Charles,</HI> a lusty friar, of
whom the people tell strange stories. Some
young women of the town were seen mount∣ing
over the wall, by a ladder of ropes, in
the dusk of the evening; and there was an
unusual crop of bastards that season. In
short, <HI>pere Charles</HI> and his companions gave
such scandal, that the whole fraternity was
changed; and now the nest is occupied by
another flight of these birds of passage. If
one of our privateers had kidnapped a Ca∣puchin
during the war, and exhibited him, in
his habit, as a shew in London, he would
have proved a good prize to the captors; for
I know not a more uncouth and grotesque a∣nimal,
than an old Capuchin in the habit of
his order. A friend of mine (a Swiss offi∣cer)
told me, that a peasant in his country
used to weep bitterly, whenever a certain
Capuchin mounted the pulpit to hold forth to
the people. The good father took notice of
this man, and believed he was touched by the
finger of the Lord. He exhorted him to en∣courage
these accessions of grace, and at the
same time to be of good comfort, as having
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
received such marks of the divine favour.
The man still continued to weep, as before,
every time the monk preached; and at last
the Capuchin insisted upon knowing what it
was, in his discourse or appearance, that
made such an impression upon his heart.—
“Ah, father! (cried the peasant) I never
see you but I think of a venerable goat,
which I lost at Easter. We were bred up to∣gether
in the same family. He was the very
picture of your reverence—one would swear
you were brothers. Poor <HI>Baudouin!</HI> he died
of a fall—rest his soul! I would willingly
pay for a couple of masses to pray him out
of purgatory.”</P>
<P>Among other public edifices at Boulogne,
there is an hospital, or workhouse, which
seems to be established upon a very good foun∣dation.
It maintains several hundreds of poor
people, who are kept constantly at work, ac∣cording
to their age and abilities, in making
thread, all sorts of lace, a kind of catgut,
and in knitting stockings. It is under the
direction of the bishop; and the see is at
present filled by a prelate of great piety and
benevolence, though a little inclining to bi∣gotry
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
and fanaticism. The churches in this
town are but indifferently built, and poorly
ornamented. There is not one picture in
the place worth looking at, nor indeed does
there seem to be the least taste for the liberal
arts.</P>
<P>In my next, I shall endeavour to satisfy you
in the other articles you desire to know.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am infinitely obliged to D. H—for the
favourable manner in which he has men∣tioned
me to the earl of H—. I have at last
recovered my books, by virtue of a particular
order to the director of the douane, procured
by the application of the English resident to
the French ministry. I am now preparing
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
for my long journey; but, before I leave
this place, I shall send you the packet I men∣tioned,
by Meriton. Mean-while I must
fulfil my promise in communicating the ob∣servations
I have had occasion to make upon
this town and country.</P>
<P>The air of Boulogne is cold and moist, and, I
believe, of consequence unhealthy. Last win∣ter
the frost, which continued six weeks in
London, lasted here eight weeks without in∣termission;
and the cold was so intense, that,
in the garden of the Capuchins, it split the
bark of several elms from top to bottom. On
our arrival here we found all kinds of fruit
more backward than in England. The frost,
in its progress to Britain, is much weakened
in crossing the sea. The atmosphere, impreg∣nated
with saline particles, resists the opera∣tion
of freezing. Hence, in severe winters,
all places near the sea-side are less cold than
more inland districts. This is the reason
why the winter is often more mild at Edin∣burgh
than at London. A very great degree
of cold is required to freeze salt water. In∣deed
it will not freeze at all, until it has de∣posited
all its salt. It is now generally al∣lowed
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
among philosophers, that water is no
more than ice thawed by heat, either solar,
or subterranean, or both; and that this heat
being expelled, it would return to its natu∣ral
consistence. This being the case, nothing
else is required for the freezing of water, than
a certain degree of cold, which may be ge∣nerated
by the help of salt, or spirit of nitre,
even under the line. I would propose, therefore,
that an apparatus of this sort should be pro∣vided
in every ship that goes to sea; and in
case there should be a deficiency of fresh
water on board, the sea-water may be ren∣dered
potable, by being first converted into
ice.</P>
<P>The air of Boulogne is not only loaded with
a great evaporation from the sea, increas∣ed
by strong gales of wind from the West and
South-West, which blow almost continually
during the greatest part of the year; but it
is also subject to putrid vapours, arising from
the low marshy ground in the neighbourhood
of the harbour, which is every tide over-flowed
with sea-water. This may be one cause
of the scrofula and rickets, which are two
prevailing disorders among the children in
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
Boulogne. But I believe the former is
more owing to the water used in the Lower
Town, which is very hard and unwholsome.
It curdles with soap, gives a red colour to the
meat that is boiled in it, and, when drank
by strangers, never fails to occasion pains in
the stomach and bowels; nay, sometimes
produces dysenteries. In all appearance it is
impregnated with nitre, if not with some∣thing
more mischievous: we know that
mundi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or pyrites, very often contains a
proportion of arsenic, mixed with sulphur,
vitriol, and mercury. Perhaps it partakes of
the acid of some coal mine; for there are coal
works in this district. There is a well of
purging water within a quarter of a mile of
the Upper Town, to which the inhabitants
resort in the morning, as the people of Lon∣don
go to the Dog-and-duck, in St. George's
fields. There is likewise a fountain of ex∣cellent
water, hard by the cathedral, in the
Upper Town, from whence I am daily sup∣plied
at a small expence. Some modern
chemists affirm, that no saline chalybeate wa∣ters
can exist, except in the neighbourhood of
coal damps; and that nothing can be more
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
mild, and gentle, and friendly to the con∣stitution,
than the said damps: but I
know that the place where I was bred stands
upon a zonic of coal; that the water which
the inhabitants generally use is hard and
brackish; and that the people are remarka∣bly
subject to the king's evil and consumpti∣on.
These I would impute to the bad water,
impregnated with the vitriol and brine of coal,
as there is nothing in the constitution of the
air that should render such distempers en∣demial.
That the air of Boulogne encou∣rages
putrefaction, appears from the effect
it has upon butcher's meat, which, though
the season is remarkably cold, we can hardly
keep four-and-twenty hours in the coolest
part of the house.</P>
<P>Living here is pretty reasonable; and the
markets are tolerably supplied. The beef is
neither fat nor firm; but very good for soup,
which is the only use the French make of it.
The veal is not so white, nor so well fed, as
the English veal; but it is more juicy, and
better tasted. The mutton and pork are very
good. We buy our poultry alive, and fatten
them at home. Here are excellent turkies,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
and no want of game: the hares, in parti∣cular,
are very large, juicy, and high-flavour∣ed.
The best part of the fish caught on this
coast is sent post to Paris, in chasse-marines,
by a company of contractors, like those of
Hastings in Sussex. Nevertheless, we have
excellent soles, skaite, flounders and whit∣ings,
and sometimes mackarel. The oysters
are very large, coarse, and rank. There is
very little fish caught on the French coast,
because the shallows run a great way from
the shore; and the fish live chiefly in deep
water: for this reason the fishermen go a
great way out to sea, sometimes even as far as
the coast of England. Notwithstanding all the
haste the contractors can make, their fish in the
summer is very often spoiled before it arrives
at Paris; and this is not to be wondered at,
considering the length of the way, which is
near one hundred and fity miles. At best it
must be in such a mortified condition, that
no other people, except the negroes on the
coast of Guinea, would feed upon it.</P>
<P>The wine commonly drank at Boulogne
comes from Auxerre, is very small and mea∣gre,
and may be had from five to eight sols a
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
bottle; that is, from two-pence halfpenny to
four-pence. The French inhabitants drink
no good wine; nor is there any to be had,
unless you have recourse to the British wine-merchants
here established, who deal in Bour∣deaux
wines, brought hither by sea for the
London market. I have very good claret
from a friend, at the rate of fifteen-pence
sterling a bottle; and excellent small beer as
reasonable as in England. I don't believe there
is a drop of generous Burgundy in the place;
and the aubergistes impose upon us shameful∣ly,
when they charge it at two livres a bot∣tle.
There is a small white wine, called <HI>pre∣niac,</HI>
which is very agreeable and very cheap.
All the brandy which I have seen in Boulogne
is new, fiery, and still-burnt. This is the trash
which the smugglers import into England:
they have it for about ten-pence a gallon.
Butchers meat is sold for five sols, or two-pence
halfpenny a pound, and the pound here
consists of eighteen ounces. I have a young tur∣key
for thirty sols; a hare for four-and-twenty;
a couple of chickens for twenty sols, and a
couple of good soles for the same price. Be∣fore
we left England, we were told that there
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
was no fruit in Boulogne; but we have
found ourselves agreeably disappointed in
this particular. The place is well supplied
with strawberries, cherries, gooseberries, co∣rinths,
peaches, apricots, and excellent pears.
I have eaten more fruit this season, than I
have done for several years. There are ma∣ny
well-cultivated gardens in the skirts of the
town; particularly one belonging to our friend
Mrs. B—, where we often drink tea in a
charming summer-house built on a rising
ground, which commands a delightful prospect
of the sea. We have many obligations
to this good lady, who is a kind neighbour,
an obliging friend, and a most agreeable com∣panion:
she speaks English prettily, and is
greatly attached to the people and the customs
of our nation. They use wood for their
common fewel, though, if I were to live at
Boulogne, I would mix it with coal, which
this country affords. Both the wood and the
coal are reasonable enough. I am certain that
a man may keep house in Boulogne for about
one half of what it will cost him in Lon∣don;
and this is said to be one of the dearest
places in France.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48"/>
The adjacent country is very agreeable,
diversified with hill and dale, corn-fields,
woods, and meadows. There is a forest of a
considerable extent, that begins about a short
league from the Upper Town: it belongs to
the king, and the wood is farmed to diffe∣rent
individuals.</P>
<P>In point of agriculture, the people in this
neighbourhood seem to have profited by the
example of the English. Since I was last in
France, fifteen years ago, a good number of
inclosures and plantations have been made in
the English fashion. There is a good many
tolerable country-houses, within a few miles
of Boulogne; but mostly empty. I was of∣fered
a compleat house, with a garden of
four acres well laid out, and two fields for
grass or hay, about a mile from the town,
for four hundred livres, about seventeen pounds
a year: it is partly furnished, stands in an
agreeable situation, with a fine prospect of
the sea, and was lately occupied by a Scotch
nobleman, who is in the service of France.</P>
<P>To judge from appearance, the people of
Boulogne are descended from the Flemings,
who formerly possessed this country; for, a
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
great many of the present inhabitants have
fine skins, fair hair, and florid complexions;
very different from the natives of France in
general, who are distinguished by black hair,
brown skins, and swarthy faces. The people
of the Boulonnois enjoy some extraordinary
privileges, and, in particular, are exempted
from the gabelle or duties upon salt: how
they deserved this mark of favour, I do not
know; but they seem to have a spirit of in∣dependence
among them, are very ferocious,
and much addicted to revenge. Many bar∣barous
murders are committed, both in the
town and country; and the peasants, from
motives of envy and resentment, frequently
set their neighbours houses on fire. Several
instances of this kind have happened in the
course of the last year. The interruption
which is given, in arbitrary governments, to
the administration of justice, by the interpo∣sition
of the great, has always a bad effect
upon the morals of the common people. The
peasants too are often rendered desperate and
savage, by the misery they suffer from the
oppression and tyranny of their landlords.
In this neighbourhood the labouring people
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
are ill lodged and wretchedly fed; and they
have no idea of cleanliness. There is a sub∣stantial
burgher in the High Town, who was
some years ago convicted of a most barba∣rous
murder. He received sentence to be
broke alive upon the wheel; but was par∣doned
by the interposition of the governor
of the county, and carries on his business
as usual in the face of the whole commu∣nity.
A furious <HI>abbé,</HI> being refused orders
by the bishop, on account of his irregular
life, took an opportunity to stab the prelate
with a knife, one Sunday, as he walked out
of the cathedral. The good bishop desired
he might be permitted to escape; but it was
thought proper to punish, with the utmost
severity, such an atrocious attempt. He was
accordingly apprehended, and, though, the
wound was not mortal, condemned to be
broke. When this dreadful sentence was ex∣ecuted,
he cried out, that it was hard he
should undergo such torments, for having
wounded a worthless priest, by whom he had
been injured, while such-a-one (naming the
burgher mentioned above) lived in ease and
security, after having brutally murdered a poor
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
man, and a helpless woman big with child,
who had not given him the least provoca∣tion.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Boulogne may be di∣vided
into three classes; the noblesse or gen∣try,
the burghers, and the canaille. I don't
mention the clergy, and the people belonging
to the law, because I shall occasionally trou∣ble
you with my thoughts upon the religion
and ecclesiastics of this country; and as for
the lawyers, exclusive of their profession, they
may be considered as belonging to one or o∣ther
of these divisions. The noblesse are
vain, proud, poor, and slothful. Very few
of them have above six thousand livres a year,
which may amount to about two hundred
and fifty pounds sterling; and many of them
have not half this revenue. I think there is
one heiress, said to be worth one hundred
thousand livres, about four thousand two
hundred pounds; but then her jewels, her
cloaths, and even her linen, are reckoned part
of this fortune. The noblesse have not the
common sense to reside at their houses in the
country, where, by farming their own grounds,
they might live at a small expence, and im∣prove
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
their estates at the same time. They
allow their country-houses to go to decay,
and their gardens and fields to waste; and re∣side
in dark holes in the Upper Town of Bou∣logne,
without light, air, or convenience.
There they starve within doors, that they
may have wherewithal to purchase fine cloaths,
and appear dressed once a day in the church,
or on the rampart. They have no education,
no taste for reading, no housewifery, nor in∣deed
any earthly occupation, but that of dres∣sing
their hair, and adorning their bodies.
They hate walking, and would never go a∣broad,
if they were not stimulated by the va∣nity
of being seen. I ought to except indeed
those who turn devotees, and spend the great∣est
part of their time with the priest, either
at church, or in their own houses. Other
amusements they have none in this place, ex∣cept
private parties of card-playing, which
are far from being expensive. Nothing can
be more parsimonious than the oeconomy of
these people: they live upon soupe and bou∣ill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
fish and sallad: they never think of giv∣ing
dinners, or entertaining their friends;
they even save the expence of coffee and tea,
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
though both are very cheap at Boulogne. They
presume that every person drinks coffee at
home, immediately after dinner, which is
always over by one o'clock; and, in lieu of
tea in the afternoon, they treat with a glass
of sherbet, or capillaire. In a word, I know
not a more insignificant set of mortals than
the noblesse of Boulogne; helpless in them∣selves,
and useless to the community; with∣out
dignity, sense, or sentiment; contempti∣ble
from pride, and ridiculous from vanity,
They pretend to be jealous of their rank,
and will entertain no correspondence with
the merchants, whom they term plebeians.
They likewise keep at a great distance from
strangers, on pretence of a delicacy in the
article of punctilio: but, as I am informed,
this statelieness is in a great measure affected,
in order to conceal their poverty, which would
appear to greater disadvantage, if they ad∣mitted
of a more familiar communication.
Considering the vivacity of the French peo∣ple,
one would imagine they could not pos∣sibly
lead such an imsipid life, altogether un∣animated
by society, or diversion. True it
is, the only profane diversions of this place
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
are a puppet-show and a mountebank; but
then their religion affords a perpetual come∣dy.
Their high masses, their feasts, their
processions, their pilgrimages, confessions,
images, tapers, robes, incense, benedictions,
spectacles, representations, and innumerable
ceremonies, which revolve almost incessantly,
furnish a variety of entertainment from one
end of the year to the other. If superstition
implies <HI>fear,</HI> never was a word more misap∣plied
than it is to the mummery of the re∣ligion
of Rome. The people are so far from
being impressed with awe and religious terror
by this sort of machinery, that it amuses their
imaginations in the most agreeable manner,
and keeps them always in good humour.
A Roman catholic longs as impatiently for the
festival of <HI>St. Suaire,</HI> or <HI>St. Croix,</HI> or <HI>St. Ve∣ronique,</HI>
as a school-boy in England for the
representation of punch and the devil; and
there is generally as much laughing at one
farce as at the other. Even when the descent
from the cross is acted, in the holy week, with
all the circumstances that ought naturally to
inspire the gravest sentiments, if you cast your
eyes among the multitude that croud the
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
place, you will not discover one melancholy
face: all is prattling, tittering, or laughing;
and ten to one but you perceive a number of
them employed in hissing the female who
personates the Virgin Mary. And here it
may not be amiss to observe, that the Ro∣man
catholics, not content with the infinite
number of saints who really existed, have
not only personified <HI>the cross,</HI> but made two
female saints out of a piece of linen. <HI>Ve∣ronique,</HI>
or <HI>Veronica,</HI> is no other than a cor∣ruption
of <HI>vera icon,</HI> or <HI>vera effigies,</HI> said to
be the exact representation of our Saviour's
face, impressed upon a piece of linen, with
which he wiped the sweat from his forehead
in his way to the place of crucifixion. The
same is worshipped under the name of St.
<HI>Suaire,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>sudarium.</HI> This
same handkerchief is said to have had three
folds, on every one of which was the impression:
one of these remains at Jerusalem, a second
was brought to Rome, and a third was con∣veyed
to Spain. Baronius says, there is a very
antient history of the <HI>sancta facies</HI> in the Va∣tican.
Tillemont, however, looks upon the
whole as a fable. Some suppose <HI>Veronica</HI> to
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
be the same with St. Haemorrhoissa, the pa∣troness
of those who are afflicted with the piles,
who make their joint invocations to her and St.
Fiacre, the son of a Scotch king, who lived and
died a hermit in France. The troops of Henry V.
of England are said to have pillaged the cha∣pel
of this Highland saint; who, in revenge,
assisted his countrymen, in the French ser∣vice,
to defeat the English at Baugé, and af∣terwards
afflicted Henry with the piles, of
which he died. This prince complained, that
he was not only plagued by the living Scots,
but even persecuted by those who were dead.</P>
<P>I know not whether I may be allowed to
compare the Romish religion to comedy, and
Calvinism to tragedy. The first amuses the
senses, and excites ideas of mirth and good-humour;
the other, like tragedy, deals in
the passions of terror and pity. Step into a
conventicle of dissenters, you will, ten to
one, hear the minister holding forth upon
the sufferings of Christ, or the torments of
hell, and see many marks of religious hor∣ror
in the faces of the hearers. This is per∣haps
one reason why the reformation did not
succeed in France, among a volatile, giddy,
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
unthinking people, shocked at the mortified
appearances of the Calvinists; and accounts
for its rapid progress among nations of a
more melancholy turn of character and com∣plexion:
for, in the conversion of the mul∣titude,
reason is generally out of the questi∣on.
Even the penance imposed upon the
catholics is little more than mock mortifica∣tion:
a murderer is often quit with his con∣fessor
for saying three prayers extraordinary;
and these easy terms, on which absolution is
obtained, certainly encourage the repetition
of the most enormous crimes. The pomp
and ceremonies of this religion, together with
the great number of holidays they observe,
howsoever they may keep up the spirits of
the commonalty, and help to diminish the
sense of their own misery, must certainly, at
the same time, produce a frivolous taste for
frippery and shew, and encourage a habit of
idleness, to which I, in a great measure,
ascribe the extreme poverty of the lower
people. Very near half of their time,
which might be profitably employed in the
exercise of industry, is lost to themselves
and the community, in attendance upon
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
the different exhibitions of religious mum∣mery.</P>
<P>But as this letter has already run to an
unconscionable length, I shall defer, till ano∣ther
occasion, what I have further to say on
the people of this place, and in the mean
time assure you, that I am always</P>
<CLOSER>Yours affectionately.</CLOSER>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>September 12, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY stay in this place now draws to∣wards
a period. 'Till within these
few days I have continued bathing, with some
advantage to my health, though the season
has been cold and wet, and disagreeable.
There was a fine prospect of a plentiful har∣vest
in this neighbourhood. I used to have
great pleasure in driving between the fields of
wheat, oats, and barley; but the crop has
been entirely ruined by the rain, and nothing
is now to be seen on the ground but the
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
tarnished straw, and the rotten spoils of the
husbandman's labour. The ground scarce
affords subsistence to a few flocks of meagre
sheep, that crop the stubble, and the inter∣vening
grass; each flock under the pro∣tection
of its shepherd, with his crook
and dogs, who lies every night in the midst
of the fold, in a little thatched travelling
lodge, mounted on a wheel-carriage. Here
he passes the night, in order to defend his
flock from the wolves, which are sometimes,
especially in winter, very bold and despe∣rate.</P>
<P>Two days ago we made an excursion with
Mrs. B—and Capt. L—to the village of
Samers, on the Paris road, about three leagues
from Boulogne. Here is a venerable abbey
of Benedictines, well endowed, with large
agreeable gardens prettily laid out. The monks
are well lodged, and well entertained. Tho'
restricted from flesh meals by the rules of
their order, they are allowed to eat wild duck
and teal, as a species of fish; and when they
long for a good <HI>bouillon,</HI> or a partridge, or
pullet, they have nothing to do but to say
they are out of order. In that case the appe∣tite
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
of the patient is indulged in his own a∣partment.
Their church is elegantly con∣trived,
but kept in a very dirty condition.
The greatest curiosity I saw in this place was
an English boy, about eight or nine years old,
from Dover, whom his father had sent hither
to learn the French language. In less than
eight weeks, he was become captain of the
boys of the place, spoke French perfectly
well, and had almost forgot his mother
tongue. But to return to the people of Bou∣logne.</P>
<P>The burghers here, as in other places, con∣sist
of merchants, shop-keepers, and artisans.
Some of the merchants have got fortunes, by
fitting out privateers during the war. A
great many single ships were taken from the
English, notwithstanding the good look-out
of our cruisers, who were so alert, that the
privateers from this coast were often taken
in four hours after they sailed from the French
harbour; and there is hardly a captain of
an <HI>armateur</HI> in Boulogne, who has not been
prisoner in England five or six times in the
course of the war. They were fitted out at
a very small expence, and used to run over
<PB N="59" REF="61"/>
in the night to the coast of England, where
they hovered as English fishing smacks, until
they kidnapped some coaster, with which they
made the best of their way across the Chan∣nel.
If they fell in with a British cruizer,
they surrendered without resistance: the cap∣tain
was soon exchanged, and the loss of the
proprietor was not great: if they brought
their prize safe into harbour, the advan∣tage
was considerable. In time of peace the
merchants of Boulogne deal in wine, bran∣dies,
and oil, imported from the South, and
export fish, with the manufactures of France,
to Portugal, and other countries; but the
trade is not great. Here are two or three
considerable houses of wine merchants from
Britain, who deal in Bourdeaux wine, with
which they supply London and other parts of
England, Scotland, and Ireland. The fishery
of mackarel and herring is so considerable on
this coast, that it is said to yield annually eight
or nine hundred thousand livres, about thir∣ty-five
thousand pounds sterling.</P>
<P>The shop-keepers here drive a considerable
traffic with the English smugglers, whose cutters
are almost the only vessels one sees in the har∣bour
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
of Boulogne, if we except about a do∣zen
of those flat-bottomed boats, which raised
such alarms in England, in the course of the
war. Indeed they seem to be good for no∣thing
else, and perhaps they were built for this
purpose only. The smugglers from the coast
of Kent and Sussex pay English gold for great
quantities of French brandy, tea, coffee, and
small wine, which they run from this coun∣try.
They likewise buy glass trinkets, toys,
and coloured prints, which sell in England,
for no other reason, but that they come from
France, as they may be had as cheap, and
much better finished, of our own manufacture.
They likewise take off ribbons, laces, linen,
and cambrics; though this branch of trade
is chiefly in the hands of traders that come
from London, and make their purchases at
Dunkirk, where they pay no duties. It is
certainly worth while for any traveller to lay
in a stock of linen either at Dunkirk or Bou∣logne;
the difference of the price at these
two places is not great. Even here I have
made a provision of shirts for one half of the
money they would have cost in London. Un∣doubtedly
the practice of smuggling is very
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
detrimental to the fair trader, and carries con∣siderable
sums of money out of the kingdom,
to enrich our rivals and enemies. The cus∣tom-house
officers are very watchful, and
make a great number of seizures: nevertheless,
the smugglers find their account in
continuing this contraband commerce; and
are said to indemnify themselves, if they save
one cargo out of three. After all, the best
way to prevent smuggling, is to lower the
duties upon the commodities which are thus
introduced. I have been told, that the reve∣nue
upon tea has encreased ever since the
duty upon it was diminished. By the bye,
the tea smuggled on the coast of Sussex is
most execrable stuff. While I stayed at Has∣tings,
for the conveniency of bathing, I must
have changed my breakfast, if I had not lucki∣ly
brought tea with me from London: yet
we have as good tea at Boulogne for nine
livres a pound, as that which sells at four∣teen
shillings at London.</P>
<P>The bourgeois of this place seem to live at
their ease, probably in consequence of their
trade with the English. Their houses consist
of the ground-floor, one story above, and
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
garrets. In those which are well furnished,
you see pier-glasses and marble slabs; but
the chairs are either paultry things, made
with straw bottoms, which cost about a shil∣ling
a-piece, or old-fashioned, high-backed
seats of needle-work, stuffed, very clumsy
and incommodious. The tables are square
fir boards, that stand on edge in a corner, ex∣cept
when they are used, and then they are
set upon cross legs that open and shut occa∣sionally.
The king of France-dines off a
board of this kind. Here is plenty of table-linen
however. The poorest tradesman in
Boulogne has a napkin on every cover, and
silver forks with four prongs, which are used
with the right hand, there being very little
occasion for knives; for the meat is boiled o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
roasted to rags. The French beds are so high<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
that sometimes one is obliged to mount the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by the help of steps; and this is also the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in Flanders. They very seldom use feather
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beds; but they lie upon a <HI>paillasse,</HI> or ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of straw, over which are laid two, and some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
times three mattrasses. Their testers are hig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and old-fashioned, and their curtains ge∣nerally
of thin bays, red, or green, laced wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
taudry yellow, in imitation of gold. In some
houses, however, one meets with furniture of
stamped linen; but there is no such thing as
a carpet to be seen, and the floors are in a
very dirty condition. They have not even the
implements of cleanliness in this country.
Every chamber is furnished with an <HI>armoire,</HI>
or clothes-press, and a chest of drawers, of
very clumsy workmanship. Every thing
shews a deficiency in the mechanic arts.
There is not a door, nor a window, that shuts
close. The hinges, locks, and latches, are of
iron, coarsely made, and ill contrived. The
very chimnies are built so open, that they ad∣mit
both rain and sun, and all of them smoke
intolerably. If there is no cleanliness among
these people, much less shall we find delicacy,
which is the cleanliness of the mind. Indeed
they are utter strangers to what we call common
decency; and I could give you some high-fla∣voured
instances, at which even a native of
Edinburgh would stop his nose. There are
certain mortifying views of human nature,
which undoubtedly ought to be concealed as
much as possible, in order to prevent giving
offence: and nothing can be more absurd,
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
than to plead the difference of custom in dif∣ferent
countries, in defence of those usages
which cannot fail giving disgust to the organs
and senses of all mankind. Will custom ex∣empt
from the imputation of gross indecency
a French lady, who shifts her frowsy smock
in presence of a male visitant, and talks to
him of her <HI>lavement,</HI> her <HI>medicine,</HI> and her
<HI>bidet!</HI> An Italian <HI>signora</HI> makes no scruple of
telling you, she is such a day to begin a course
of physic for the <HI>pox.</HI> The celebrated re∣former
of the Italian comedy introduces a
child befouling itself on the stage, OE, NO
TI SENTI? BISOGNA DESFASSARLO, <HI>(fa cenno
che sentesi mal odore).</HI> I have known a lady
handed to the house of office by her admirer,
who stood at the door, and entertained her
with <HI>bons mots</HI> all the time she was within.
But I should be glad to know, whether it is
possible for a fine lady to speak and act in this
manner, without exciting ideas to her own
disadvantage in the mind of every man who
has any imagination left, and enjoys the in∣tire
use of his senses, howsoever she may be
authorised by the customs of her country▪
There is nothing so vile or repugnant to na∣ture,
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
but you may plead prescription for it,
in the customs of some nation or other. A
Parisian likes mortified flesh: a native of
Legiboli will not taste his fish till it is quite
putrefied: the civilized inhabitants of Kam∣schatka
get drunk with the urine of their
guests, whom they have already intoxicated:
the Nova Zemblans make merry on train-oil:
the Groenlanders eat in the same dish
with their dogs: the Caffres, at the Cape of
Good Hope, piss upon those whom they de∣light
to honour, and feast upon a sheep's in∣testines
with their contents, as the greatest
dainty that can be presented. A true-bred
Frenchman dips his fingers, imbrowned with
snuff, into his plate filled with ragout:
between every three mouthfuls, he produces
his snuff-box, and takes a fresh pinch, with
the most graceful gesticulations; then he
displays his handkerchief, which may be
termed the <HI>flag of abomination,</HI> and, in the
use of both, scatters his favours among those
who have the happiness to sit near him. It
must be owned, however, that a Frenchman
will not drink out of a tankard, in which,
perhaps, a dozen of filthy mouths have slab∣bered,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
as is the custom in England. Here
every individual has his own gobelet, which
stands before him, and he helps himself oc∣casionally
with wine, or water, or both,
which likewise stand upon the table. But I
know no custom more beastly than that of
using water-glasses, in which polite company
spirit, and squirt, and spue the filthy scourings
of their gums, under the eyes of each
other. I knew a lover cured of his passion,
by seeing this nasty cascade discharged from
the mouth of his mistress. I don't doubt but
I shall live to see the day, when the hospita∣ble
custom of the antient Aegyptians will be
revived; then a conveniency will be placed
behind every chair in company, with a pro∣per
provision of waste paper, that individu∣als
may make themselves easy without part∣ing
company. I insist upon it, that this
practice would not be more indelicate than
that which is now in use. What then, you
will say, must a man sit with his chops and
fingers up to the ears and knuckles in
grease? No; let those who cannot eat with∣out
defiling themselves, step into another
room, provided with basons and towels: but
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
I think it be would better to institute schools,
where youth may learn to eat their victuals,
without daubing themselves, or giving of∣fence
to the eyes of one another.</P>
<P>The bourgeois of Boulogne have commonly
soup and bouillé at noon, and a roast, with
a sallad, for supper; and at all their meals
there is a desert of fruit. This indeed is the
practice all over France. On meagre days
they eat fish, omelettes, fried beans, fricas∣sees
of eggs and onions, and burnt cream.
The tea which they drink in the afternoon is
rather boiled than infused; it is sweetened all
together with coarse sugar, and drank with
an equal quantity of boiled milk.</P>
<P>We had the honour to be entertained the
other day by our landlord, Mr. B—, who
spared no cost on this banquet, exhibited for
the glory of France. He had invited a new-married
couple, together with the husband's
mother, and the lady's father, who was one
of the noblesse of Montreuil, his name Mons.
L—y. There were likewise some merchants
of the town, and Mons. B—'s uncle, a fa∣cetious
little man, who had served in the Eng∣lish
navy, and was as big and as round as a
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
hogshead; we were likewise favoured with the
company of father K—, a native of Ireland,
who is <HI>vicaire,</HI> or curate of the parish; and
among the guests was Mons. L—y's son, a
pretty boy, about thirteen or fourteen years
of age. The <HI>repas</HI> served up in three ser∣vices,
or courses, with <HI>entreés</HI> and <HI>hors
d'oeuvres,</HI> exclusive of the fruit, consisted of
above twenty dishes, extremely well dressed
by the <HI>rotisseur,</HI> who is the best cook I ever
knew, in France, or elsewhere; but the <HI>plats</HI>
were not presented with much order. Our
young ladies did not seem to be much used
to do the honours of the table. The most
extraordinary circumstance that I observed
on this occasion was, that all the French who
were present ate of every dish that appear∣ed;
and I am told, that if there had been an
hundred articles more, they would have had
a trial of each. This is what they call doing
justice to the founder. Mons. L—y was
placed at the head of the table; and indeed
he was the oracle and orator of the compa∣ny;
tall, thin, and weather-beaten, not un∣like
the picture of Don Quixote after he had
lost his teeth. He had been <HI>garde du corps,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
or life-guardman at Versailles; and by virtue
of this office he was perfectly well acquaint∣ed
with the persons of the king and the dau∣phin,
with the characters of the ministers
and grandees, and, in a word, with all the
secrets of state, on which he held forth with
equal solemnity and elocution. He exclaim∣ed
against the jesuits, and the farmers of the
revenue, who, he said, had ruined France.
Then, addressing himself to me, asked, if
the English did not every day drink to the
health of <HI>madame la marquise?</HI> I did not at
first comprehend his meaning; but answered
in general, that the English were not defici∣ent
in complaisance for the ladies. “Ah!
(cried he) she is the best friend they have in
the world. If it had not been for her, they
would not have such reason to boast of the
advantages of the war.” I told him the on∣ly
conquest which the French had made in
the war, was atchieved by one of her gene∣rals:
I meant the taking of Mahon. But I
did not choose to prosecute the discourse, re∣membering
that in the year 1749, I had like
to have had an affair with a Frenchman at
Ghent, who affirmed, that all the battles
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
gained by the great duke of Marlborough
were purposely lost by the French generals,
in order to bring the schemes of madame de
Maintenon into disgrace. This is no bad
resource for the national vanity of these peo∣ple:
though, in general, they are really per∣suaded,
that theirs is the richest, the bravest,
the happiest, and the most powerful nation
under the sun; and therefore, without some
such cause, they must be invincible. By the
bye, the common people here still frighten
their wayward children with the name of
<HI>Marlborough.</HI> Mr. B—'s son, who was
nursed at a peasant's house, happening one
day, after he was brought home, to be in
disgrace with his father, who threatened to
correct him, the child ran for protection to
his mother, crying, “<HI>faites sortir ce vilaine
Malbroug.</HI>” It is amazing to hear a sensible
Frenchman assert, that the revenues of France
amount to four hundred millions of livres,
about twenty millions sterling, clear of all
incumbrances, when in fact their clear reve∣nue
is not much above ten. Without all
doubt they have reason to inveigh against the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, who oppress the people in
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
raising the taxes, not above two thirds of
which are brought into the king's coffers:
the rest enriches themselves, and enables them
to bribe high for the protection of the great,
which is the only support they have against
the remonstrances of the states and parlia∣ments,
and the suggestions of common sense;
which will ever demonstrate this to be, of
all others, the most pernicious method of
supplying the necessities of government.</P>
<P>Mons. L—y seasoned the severity of his
political apothegms with intermediate sallies
of mirth and gallantry. He ogled the ve∣nerable
gentlewoman his <HI>commere,</HI> who sat by
him. He looked, sighed, and languished,
sung tender songs, and kissed the old lady's
hand with all the ardour of a youthful ad∣mirer.
I unfortunately congratulated him
on having such a pretty young gentleman to
his son. He answered, sighing, that the
boy had talents, but did not put them to a
proper use—“long before I attained his age
(said he) I had finished my rhetoric.” Cap∣tain
B—, who had eaten himself black in
the face, and, with the napkin under his
chin, was no bad representation of Sancho
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
Panza in the sutis, with the dishclout about
his neck, when the duke's scuilions insisted
upon shaving him; this sea-wit, turning to
the boy, with a waggish leer, “I suppose
(said he) you don't understand the figure of
<HI>amplification</HI> so well as Monsieur your father.”
At that instant, one of the nieces, who
knew her uncle to be very ticklish, touched
him under the short ribs, on which the little
man attempted to spring up, but lost the
centre of gravity. He overturned his own
plate in the lap of the person that sat next to
him, and falling obliquely upon his own
chair, both tumbled down upon the floor to∣gether,
to the great discomposure of the
whole company; for the poor man would
have been actually strangled, had not his
nephew loosed his stock with great expedi∣tion.
Matters being once more adjusted, and
the captain condoled on his disaster, Mons.
L—y took it in his head to read his son a
lecture upon filial obedience. This was min∣gled
with some sharp reproof, which the boy
took so ill that he retired. The old lady ob∣served
that he had been too severe: her daugh∣ter-in-law,
who was very pretty, said her bro∣ther
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
had given him too much reason; hint∣ing,
at the same time, that he was addicted
to some terrible vices; upon which several
individuals repeated the interjection, ah!
ah! “Yes (said Mons. L—y, with a rue∣ful
aspect) the boy has a pernicious turn for
gaming: in one afternoon he lost, at billi∣ards,
such a sum as gives me horror to think
of it.” “Fifty sols in one afternoon,” (cri∣ed
the sister) “Fifty sols! (exclaimed the
mother-in-law, with marks of astonishment)
that's too much—that's too much!—he's to
blame—he's to blame! but youth, you know
Mons. L—y—ah! vive la jeunesse!” “et
l'amour!” cried the father, wiping his eyes,
squeezing her hand, and looking tenderly
upon her. Mr. B—took this opportunity
to bring in the young gentleman, who was
admitted into favour, and received a second
exhortation. Thus harmony was restored,
and the entertainment concluded with fruit,
coffee, and <HI>liqueurs.</HI></P>
<P>When a bourgeois of Boulogne takes the
air, he goes in a one horse-chaise, which is here
called <HI>cabriolet,</HI> and hires it for half-a-crown
a day. There are also travelling chaises, which
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
hold four persons, two seated with their faces
to the horses, and two behind their backs;
but those vehicles are all very ill made, and
extremely inconvenient. The way of riding
most used in this place is on assback. You
will see every day, in the skirts of the town,
a great number of females thus mounted,
with the feet on either side occasionally, ac∣cording
as the wind blows, so that sometimes
the right and sometimes the left hand guides
the beast: but in other parts of France, as
well as in Italy, the ladies sit on horseback
with their legs astride, and are provided with
drawers for that purpose.</P>
<P>When I said the French people were kept
in good humour by the fopperies of their re∣ligion,
I did not mean that there were no
gloomy spirits among them. There will be
fanatics in religion, while there are people
of a saturnine disposition, and melancholy
turn of mind. The character of a <HI>devotee,</HI>
which is hardly known in England, is very
common here. You see them walking to
and from church at all hours, in their hoods
and long camblet cloaks, with a slow pace,
demure aspect, and downcast eye. Those who
<PB N="75" REF="77"/>
are poor become very troublesome to the
monks, with their scruples and cases of con∣science:
you may see them on their knees,
at the confessional, every hour in the day.
The rich <HI>devotee</HI> has her favourite confessor,
whom she consults and regales in private, at
her own house; and this spiritual director
generally governs the whole family. For
my part, I never knew a fanatic that was
not an hypocrite at bottom. Their preten∣sions
to superior sanctity, and an absolute
conquest over all the passions, which human
reason was never yet able to subdue, intro∣duce
a habit of dissimulation, which, like
all other habits, is confirmed by use, till at
length they become adepts in the art and
science of hypocrisy. Enthusiasm and hy∣pocrisy
are by no means incompatible. The
wildest fanatics I ever knew, were real sensu∣alists
in their way of living, and cunning
cheats in their dealings with mankind.</P>
<P>Among the lower class of people at Bou∣logne,
those who take the lead, are the sea-faring
men, who live in one quarter, divided
into classes, and registered for the service of
the king. They are hardy and raw-boned,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
exercise the trade of fishermen and boatmen,
and propagate like rabbits. They have put
themselves under the protection of a mira∣culous
image of the Virgin Mary, which is
kept in one of their churches, and every
year carried in procession. According to the
legend, this image was carried off, with o∣ther
pillage, by the English, when they took
Boulogne, in the reign of Henry VIII. The
lady, rather than reside in England, where
she found a great many heretics, trusted her∣self
alone in an open boat, and crossed the
sea to the road of Boulogne, where she was
seen waiting for a pilot. Accordingly a boat
put off to her assistance, and brought her
safe into the harbour: since which time she
has continued to patronize the watermen of
Boulogne. At present she is very black and
very ugly, besides being cruelly mutilated in
different parts of her body, which I suppose
have been amputated, and converted into to∣bacco-stoppers;
but once a year she is dressed
in very rich attire, and carried in procession,
with a silver boat, provided at the expence of
the sailors. That vanity which characterises
the French extends even to the canaille,
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
The lowest creature among them is sure to
have her ear-rings and golden cross hanging
about her neck. Indeed this last is an imple∣ment
of superstition as well as of dress, with∣out
which no female appears. The common
people here, as in all countries where they
live poorly and dirtily, are hard-featured,
and of very brown, or rather tawny com∣plexions.
As they seldom eat meat, their
juices are destitute of that animal oil which
gives a plumpness and smoothness to the skin,
and defends those fine capillaries from the
injuries of the weather, which would other∣wise
coalesce, or be shrunk up, so as to im∣pede
the circulation on the external surface of
the body. As for the dirt, it undoubtedly
blocks up the pores of the skin, and disor∣ders
the perspiration; consequently must con∣tribute
to the scurvy, itch, and other cuta∣neous
distempers.</P>
<P>In the quarter of the <HI>matelots</HI> at Boulogne,
there is a number of poor Canadians, who
were removed from the island of St. John,
in the gulph of St. Laurence, when it was
reduced by the English. These people are
maintained at the expence of the king, who
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
allows them soldier's pay, that is five sols,
or two-pence halfpenny a day; or rather
three sols and ammunition bread. How the
soldiers contrive to subsist upon this wretched
allowance, I cannot comprehend: but, it
must be owned, that those invalids who do
duty at Boulogne betray no marks of want.
They are hale and stout, neatly and de∣cently
cloathed, and on the whole look bet∣ter
than the pensioners of Chelsea.</P>
<P>About three weeks ago I was favoured with a
visit by one Mr. M—, an English gentleman,
who seems far gone in a consumption. He passed
the last winter at Nismes in Languedoc, and
found himself much better in the beginning
of summer, when he embarked at Cette, and
returned by sea to England. He soon re∣lapsed,
however, and (as he imagines) in
consequence of a cold caught at sea. He told
me, his intention was to try the South again,
and even to go as far as Italy. I advised him
to make trial of the air of Nice, where I
myself proposed to reside. He seemed to re∣lish
my advice, and proceeded towards Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in his own carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>
I shall to-morrow ship my great chests on
board of a ship bound to Bourdeaux; they
are directed, and recommended to the care of
a merchant of that place, who will forward
them by Thoulouse, and the canal of Lan∣guedoc,
to his correspondent at Cette, which
is the sea-port of Montpellier. The charge
of their conveyance to Bourdeaux does not
exceed one guinea. They consist of two very
large chests and a trunk, about a thousand
pounds weight; and the expence of trans∣porting
them from Bourdeaux to Cette, will
not exceed thirty livres. They are already
sealed with lead at the custom-house, that
they may be exempted from further visitation.
This is a precaution which every traveller
takes, both by sea and land: he must like∣wise
provide himself with a <HI>passe-avant</HI> at the
bureau, otherwise he may be stopped, and
rummaged at every town through which he
passes. I have hired a berline and four horses
to Paris, for fourteen loui'dores; two of
which the <HI>voiturier</HI> is obliged to pay for a
permission from the farmers of the poste;
for every thing is farmed in this country;
and if you hire a carriage, as I have done,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
you must pay twelve livres, or half a guinea,
for every person that travels in it. The com∣mon
coach between Calais and Paris, is such
a vehicle as no man would use, who has any
regard to his own ease and convenience; and
it travels at the pace of an English waggon.</P>
<P>In ten days I shall set out on my journey;
and I shall leave Boulogne with regret. I have
been happy in the acquaintance of Mrs. B—,
and a few British families in the place; and
it was my good fortune to meet here with two
honest gentlemen, whom I had formerly
known in Paris, as well as with some of my
countrymen, officers in the service of France.
My next will be from Paris. Remember me
to our friends at A—'s. I am a little hea∣vy-hearted
at the prospect of removing to
such a distance from you. It is a moot poin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
whether I shall ever return. My health is
very precarious.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>October 12, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF our journey from Boulogne I have
little to say. The weather was favour∣able,
and the roads were in tolerable order. We
found good accommodation at Montreuil and
Amiens; but in every other place where we
stopped, we met with abundance of dirt,
and the most flagrant imposition. I shall not
pretend to describe the cities of Abbeville and
Amiens, which we saw only <HI>en passant;</HI> nor
take up your time with an account of the
stables and palace of Chantilly, belonging
to the prince of Condé, which we visited the
last day of our journey; nor shall I detain
you with a detail of the <HI>Tresors de St. De∣nis,</HI>
which, together with the tombs in the
abbey church, afforded us some amusement
while our dinner was getting ready. All
these particulars are mentioned in twenty dif∣ferent
books of tours, travels, and directi∣ons,
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
which you have often perused. I shall
only observe, that the abbey church is the
lightest piece of Gothic architecture I have
seen, and the air within seems perfectly free
from that damp and moisture, so perceivable
in all our old cathedrals. This must be ow∣ing
to the nature of its situation. There are
some fine marble statues that adorn the tombs
of certain individuals here interred; but they
are mostly in the French taste, which is quite
contrary to the simplicity of the antients.
Their attitudes are affected, unnatural, and
desultory; and their draperies fantastic; or,
as one of our English artists expressed him∣self,
<HI>they are all of a flutter.</HI> As for the trea∣sures,
which are shewn on certain days to the
populace gratis, they are contained in a num∣ber
of presses, or armoires, and, if the stones
are genuine, they must be inestimable: but
this I cannot believe. Indeed I have been
told, that what they shew as diamonds are
no more than composition: nevertheless, ex∣clusive
of these, there are some rough stones
of great value, and many curiosities worth
seeing. The monk that shewed them wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
the very image of our friend Hamilton, both
in his looks and manner.</P>
<P>I have one thing very extraordinary to
observe of the French auberges, which seems
to be a remarkable deviation from the gene∣ral
character of the nation. The landlords,
hostesses, and servants of the inns upon the
road, have not the least dash of complaisance
in their behaviour to strangers. Instead of
coming to the door, to receive you as in Eng∣land,
they take no manner of notice of you;
but leave you to find or enquire your way
into the kitchen, and there you must ask
several times for a chamber, before they seem
willing to conduct you up stairs. In gene∣ral,
you are served with the appearance of
the most mortifying indifference, at the very
time they are laying schemes for fleecing you
of your money. It is a very odd contrast
between France and England; in the former
all the people are complaisant but the publi∣cans;
in the latter there is hardly any com∣plaisance
but among the publicans. When
I said all the people in France, I ought also
to except those vermin who examine the bag∣gage
of travellers in different parts of the
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
kingdom. Although our portmanteaus were
sealed with lead, and we were provided with
a passe-avant from the douane, our coach
was searched at the gate of Paris by which
we entered; and the women were obliged to
get out, and stand in the open street, till this
operation was performed.</P>
<P>I had desired a friend to provide lodg∣ings
for me at Paris, in the Faux∣bourg
St. Germain; and accordingly we
found ourselves accommodated at the Hotel
de Montmorency, with a first floor, which
costs me ten livres a day. I should have put
up with it had it been less polite; but as I
have only a few days to stay in this place,
and some visits to receive, I am not sorry
that my friend has exceeded his commission.
I have been guilty of another piece of extra∣vagance
in hiring a <HI>carosse de remise,</HI> for which
I pay twelve livres a day. Besides the arti∣cle
of visiting, I could not leave Paris, with∣out
carrying my wife and the girls to see the
most remarkable places in and about this
capital, such as the Luxemburg, the Palais-Royal,
the Thuilleries, the Louvre, the In∣valids,
the Gobelins, &amp;c. together with Ver∣sailles,
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
Trianon, Marli, Meudon, and Choissi;
and therefore, I thought the difference in
point of expence would not be great, be∣tween
a carosse de remise and a hackney
coach. The first are extremely elegant, if
not too much ornamented, the last are very
shabby and disagreeable. Nothing gives me
such chagrin, as the necessity I am under
to hire a <HI>valet de place,</HI> as my own servant
does not speak the language. You cannot
conceive with what eagerness and dexterity
those rascally valets exert themselves in pillag∣ing
strangers. There is always one ready in
waiting on your arrival, who begins by assist∣ing
your own servant to unload your bag∣gage,
and interests himself in your affairs
with such artful officiousness, that you will
find it difficult to shake him off, even though
you are determined beforehand against hiring
any such domestic. He produces recommen∣dations
from his former masters, and the
people of the house vouch for his honesty.
The truth is, those fellows are very handy,
useful, and obliging; and so far honest, that
they will not steal in the usual way. You
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
may safely trust one of them to bring you
a hundred loui'dores from your banker; but
they fleece you without mercy in every other
article of expence. They lay all your trades∣men
under contribution; your taylor, bar∣ber,
mantua-maker, milliner, perfumer, shoe∣maker,
mercer, jeweller, hatter, traiteur,
and wine-merchant: even the bourgeouis who
owns your coach pays him twenty sols per
day. His wages amount to twice as much,
so that I imagine the fellow that serves me,
makes above ten shillings a day, besides his
victuals, which, by the bye, he has no right
to demand. Living at Paris, to the best of
my recollection, is very near twice as dear
as it was fifteen years ago; and, indeed, this
is the case in London; a circumstance that
must be undoubtedly owing to an increase of
taxes; for I don't find that in the articles of
eating and drinking, the French people are
more luxurious than they were heretofore. I
am told the <HI>entrees,</HI> or duties, payed upon
provision imported into Paris, are very hea∣vy.
All manner of butchers meat and poul∣try
are extremely good in this place. The
beef is excellent. The wine, which is gene∣rally
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
drank, is a very thin kind of Burgun∣dy.
I can by no means relish their cookery;
but one breakfasts deliciously upon their <HI>petit
pains</HI> and their <HI>patés</HI> of butter, which last is
exquisite.</P>
<P>The common people, and even the bour∣geois
of Paris live, at this season, chiefly on
bread and grapes, which is undoubtedly very
wholsome fare. If the same simplicity of diet
prevailed in England, we should certainly
undersel the French at all foreign markets:
for they are very slothful with all their viva∣city;
and the great number of their holidays
not only encourages this lazy disposition, but
actually robs them of one half of what their
labour would otherwise produce; so that, if
our common people were not so expensive in
their living, that is, in their eating and drink∣ing,
labour might be afforded cheaper in
England than in France. There are three
young lusty hussies, nieces or daughters of
a blacksmith, that lives just opposite to my
windows, who do nothing from morning till
night. They eat grapes and bread from se∣ven
till nine, from nine till twelve they dress
their hair, and are all the afternoon gaping
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
at the window to view passengers. I don't
perceive that they give themselves the trouble
either to make their beds, or clean their apart∣ment.
The same spirit of idleness and dissi∣pation
I have observed in every part of France,
and among every class of people.</P>
<P>Every object seems to have shrunk in its
dimensions since I was last in Paris. The
Louvre, the Palais Royal, the bridges, and
the river Seine, by no means answer the i∣deas
I had formed of them from my former
observation. When the memory is not very
correct, the imagination always betrays her
into such extravagances. When I first re∣visited
my own country, after an absence of
fourteen years, I found every thing diminish∣ed
in the same manner, and I could scarce
believe my own eyes.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the gay disposition of the
French, their houses are all gloomy. In spite
of all the ornaments that have been lavished
on Versailles, it is a dismal habitation. The
apartments are dark, ill-furnished, dirty, and
unprincely. Take the castle, chapel, and
garden all together, they make a most fan∣tastic
composition of magnificence and little∣ness,
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
taste, and foppery. After all, it is
in England only, where we must look for
cheerful apartments, gay furniture, neatness,
and convenience. There is a strange incon∣gruity
in the French genius. With all their
volatility, prattle, and fondness for <HI>bons mots,</HI>
they delight in a species of drawling, me∣lancholy,
church music. Their most fa∣vourite
dramatic pieces are almost without
incident; and the dialogue of their come∣dies
consists of moral, insipid apophthegms,
intirely destitute of wit, or repartee. I know
what I hazard by this opinion among the
implicit admirers of Lully, Racine, and Mo∣liere.</P>
<P>I don't talk of the busts, the statues, and
pictures which abound at Versailles, and o∣ther
places, in and about Paris, particularly
the great collection of capital pieces in the
Palais-royal, belonging to the duke of Or∣leans.
I have neither capacity, nor inclina∣tion,
to give a critique on these <HI>chef d'oeuvres,</HI>
which indeed would take up a whole vo∣lume.
I have seen this great magazine of
painting three times, with astonishment; but
I should have been better pleased, if there
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
had not been half the number: one is
bewildered in such a profusion, as not to
know where to begin, and hurried a∣way
before there is time to consider one
piece with any sort of deliberation. Besides,
the rooms are all dark, and a great many of
the pictures hang in a bad light. As for
Trianon, Marli, and Choissi, they are no
more than pigeon-houses, in respect to pa∣laces;
and, notwithstanding the extravagant
eulogiums which you have heard of the
French king's houses, I will venture to affirm,
that the king of England is better, I mean
more comfortably, lodged. I ought, how∣ever,
to except Fontainebleau, which I have
not seen.</P>
<P>The city of Paris is said to be five leagues,
or fifteen miles, in circumference; and if it
is really so, it must be much more populous
than London; for the streets are very nar∣row,
and the houses very high, with a diffe∣rent
family on every floor. But I have mea∣sured
the best plans of these two royal cities,
and am certain that Paris does not take up
near so much ground as London and West∣minster
occupy; and I suspect the number
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
of its inhabitants is also exaggerated by those
who say it amounts to eight hundred thou∣sand,
that is two hundred thousand more
than are contained in the bills of mortality.
The hotels of the French noblesse, at Paris,
take up a great deal of room, with their
court-yards and gardens; and so do their
convents and churches. It must be owned,
indeed, that their streets are wonderfully
crouded with people and carriages.</P>
<P>The French begin to imitate the English,
but only in such particulars as render them
worthy of imitation. When I was last at
Paris, no person of any condition, male or
female, appeared, but in full dress, even
when obliged to come out early in the morn∣ing,
and there was not such a thing to be
seen as a <HI>peruque ronde;</HI> but at present I see
a number of frocks and scratches in a morn∣ing,
in the streets of this metropolis. They
have set up a <HI>petite poste,</HI> on the plan of our
penny-post, with some improvements; and
I am told there is a scheme on foot for sup∣plying
every house with water, by leaden
pipes, from the river Seine. They have even
adopted our practice of the cold bath, which
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
is taken very conveniently, in wooden houses,
erected on the side of the river, the water of
which is let in and out occasionally, by cocks
fixed in the sides of the bath. There are
different rooms for the different sexes: the
accommodations are good, and the expence
is a trifle. The tapestry of the Gobelins is
brought to an amazing degree of perfection;
and I am surprised that this furniture is not
more in fashion among the great, who alone
are able to purchase it. It would be a most
elegant and magnificent ornament, which
would always nobly distinguish their apart∣ments
from those of an inferior rank; and
in this they would run no risque of being ri∣valled
by the bourgeois. At the village of
Chaillot, in the neighbourhood of Paris, they
make beautiful carpets and screen-work; and
this is the more extraordinary, as there are
hardly any carpets used in this kingdom. In
almost all the lodging-houses, the floors are
of brick, and have no other kind of clean∣ing,
than that of being sprinkled with wa∣ter,
and swept once a day. These brick
floors, the stone stairs, the want of wain∣scotting
in the rooms, and the thick party∣walls
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
of stone, are, however, good preser∣vatives
against fire, which seldom does any
damage in this city. Instead of wainscot∣ting,
the walls are covered with tapestry or
damask. The beds in general are very good,
and well ornamented, with testers and cur∣tains.</P>
<P>Fifteen years ago the river Seine, within a
mile of Paris, was as solitary as if it had run
through a desert. At present the banks of
it are adorned with a number of elegant
houses and plantations, as far as Marli. I
need not mention the machine at this place
for raising water, because I know you are well
acquainted with its construction; nor shall I
say any thing more of the city of Paris, but
that there is a new square, built upon an ele∣gant
plan, at the end of the garden of the
Thuilleries: it is called Place de Louis XV.
and, in the middle of it, there is a good e∣questrian
statue of the reigning king.</P>
<P>You have often heard that Louis XIV. fre∣quently
regretted, that his country did not
afford gravel for the walks of his gardens,
which are covered with a white, loose sand,
very disagreeable both to the eyes and feet of
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
those who walk upon it; but this is a vul∣gar
mistake. There is plenty of gravel on
the road between Paris and Versailles, as
well as in many other parts of this king∣dom;
but the French, who are all for glare
and glitter, think the other is more gay and
agreeable: one would imagine they did not
feel the burning reflexion from the white
sand, which in summer is almost intole∣rable.</P>
<P>In the character of the French, considered
as a people, there are undoubtedly many cir∣cumstances
truly ridiculous. You know the
fashionable people, who go a hunting, are
equipped with their jack boots, bag wigs,
swords and pistols: but I saw the other day
a scene still more grotesque. On the road to
Choissi, a <HI>fiacre,</HI> or hackney-coach, stopped,
and out came five or six men, armed with
musquets, who took post, each behind a se∣parate
tree. I asked our servant who they
were, imagining they might be <HI>archers,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
footpads of justice, in pursuit of some male∣factor.
But guess my surprise, when the fel∣low
told me, they were gentlemen <HI>à la chasse</HI>
They were in fact come out from Paris, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
this equipage, to take the diversion of hare∣hunting;
that is, of shooting from behind
a tree at the hares that chanced to pass. In∣deed,
if they had nothing more in view, but
to destroy the game, this was a very effectual
method; for the hares are in such plenty in
this neighbourhood, that I have seen a dozen
together, in the same field. I think this way
of hunting, in a coach or chariot, might be
properly adopted at London, in favour of
those aldermen of the city, who are too un∣wieldy
to follow the hounds a horseback.</P>
<P>The French, however, with all their ab∣surdities,
preserve a certain ascendancy over
us, which is very disgraceful to our nation;
and this appears in nothing more than in
the article of dress. We are contented to be
thought their apes in fashion; but, in fact,
we are slaves to their taylors, mantua-mak∣ers,
barbers, and other tradesmen. One would
be apt to imagine that our own tradesmen
had joined them in a combination against us.
When the natives of France come to Lon∣don,
they appear in all public places, with
cloaths made according to the fashion of their
own country, and this fashion is generally
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
admired by the English. Why, therefore,
don't we follow it implicitly? No, we pique
ourselves upon a most ridiculous deviation
from the very modes we admire, and please
ourselves with thinking this deviation is a
mark of our spirit and liberty. But, we
have not spirit enough to persist in this de∣viation,
when we visit their country: other∣wise,
perhaps, they would come to admire
and follow our example: for, certainly, in
point of true taste, the fashions of both
countries are equally absurd. At present,
the skirts of the English descend from the
fifth rib to the calf of the leg, and give the
coat the form of a Jewish gaberdine; and
our hats seem to be modelled after that which
Pistol wears upon the stage. In France, the
haunch buttons and pocket-holes are within
half a foot of the coat's extremity: their
hats look as if they had been pared round
the brims, and the crown is covered with a
kind of cordage, which, in my opinion pro∣duces
a very beggarly effect. In every other
circumstance of dress, male and female, the
contrast between the two nations, appears e∣qually
glaring. What is the consequence?
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
when an Englishman comes to Paris, he can∣not
appear until he has undergone a total
metamorphosis. At his first arrival he finds
it necessary to send for the taylor, peruquier,
hatter, shoemaker, and every other trades∣man
concerned in the equipment of the hu∣man
body. He must even change his buckles,
and the form of his ruffles; and, though at
the risque of his life, suit his cloaths to the
mode of the season. For example, though
the weather should be never so cold, he must
wear his <HI>habit d'eté,</HI> or <HI>de mi-saison,</HI> without
presuming to put on a warm dress before the
day which fashion has fixed for that purpose;
and neither old age nor infirmity will excuse
a man for wearing his hat upon his head,
either at home or abroad. Females are (if
possible) still more subject to the caprices of
fashion; and as the articles of their dress are
more manifold, it is enough to make a man's
heart ake to see his wife surrounded by a
multitude of <HI>cotturieres,</HI> milliners, and tire-women.
All her sacks and negligees must be
altered and new trimmed. She must have
new caps, new laces, new shoes, and her hair
new cut. She must have her taffaties for the
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
summer, her flowered silks for the spring and
autumn, her sattins and damasks for winter.
The good man, who used to wear the <HI>beau
drap d'Angleterre,</HI> quite plain all the year
round, with a long bob, or tye perriwig,
must here provide himself with a camblet suit
trimmed with silver for spring and autumn,
with silk cloaths for summer, and cloth laced
with gold, or velvet for winter; and he must
wear his bag-wig <HI>a la pigeon.</HI> This variety
of dress is absolutely indispensible for all those
who pretend to any rank above the meer
bourgeois. On his return to his own country,
all this frippery is useless. He cannot appear
in London until he has undergone another
thorough metamorphosis; so that he will have
some reason to think, that the tradesmen of
Paris and London have combined to lay him
under contribution: and they, no doubt, are
the directors who regulate the fashions in
both capitals; the English, however, in a
subordinate capacity: for the puppets of
their making will not pass at Paris, nor in∣deed
in any other part of Europe; whereas a
French petit maitre is reckoned a complete<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
figure every where, London not excepted
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
Since it is so much the humour of the Eng∣lish
at present to run abroad, I wish they
had antigallican spirit enough to produce
themselves in their own genuine English dress,
and treat the French modes with the same
philosophical contempt, which was shewn by
an honest gentleman, distinguished by the
name of Wig-Middleton. That unshaken
patriot still appears in the same kind of scratch
perriwig, skimming-dish hat, and slit sleeve,
which were worn five-and-twenty years ago,
and has invariably persisted in this garb, in
defiance of all the revolutions of the mode.
I remember a student in the temple, who,
after a long and learned investigation of the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>beautiful,</HI> had resolution enough
to let his beard grow, and wore it in all pub∣lic
places, until his heir at law applied
for a commission of lunacy against him;
then he submitted to the razor, rather than
run any risque of being found <HI>non compos.</HI></P>
<P>Before I conclude, I must tell you, that
the most reputable shop-keepers and trades∣men
of Paris think it no disgrace to practise
the most shameful imposition. I myself
know an instance of one of the most credi∣table
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
<HI>marchands</HI> in this capital, who demanded
six francs an ell for some lutestring, laying
his hand upon his breast at the same time,
and declaring <HI>en conscience,</HI> that it had cost
him within three sols of the money. Yet
in, less than three minutes, he sold it for four
and a half, and when the buyer upbraided
him with his former declaration, he shrugged
up his shoulders, saying, <HI>il faut marchander.</HI>
I don't mention this as a particular instance.
The same mean disingenuity is universal all
over France, as I have been informed by se∣veral
persons of veracity.</P>

<OPENER>To Mrs. M—.
<DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>October 12, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall be much pleased if the remarks I
have made on the characters of the French
people, can afford you the satisfaction you
require. With respect to the ladies, I can
only judge from their exteriors: but, indeed,
these are so characteristic, that one can hard∣ly
judge amiss; unless we suppose that a wo∣man
of taste and sentiment may be so over∣ruled
by the absurdity of what is called fashion,
as to reject reason, and disguise nature,
in order to become ridiculous or frightful.
That this may be the case with some indivi∣duals,
is very possible. I have known it hap∣pen
in our own country, where the follies
of the French are adopted, and exhibited in
the most aukward imitation: but the gene∣ral
prevalence of those preposterous modes,
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
is a plain proof that there is a general want
of taste, and a general depravity of nature.
I shall not pretend to describe the particulars
of a French lady's dress. These you are
much better acquainted with than I can pre∣tend
to be: but this I will be bold to affirm,
that France is the general reservoir from
which all the absurdities of false taste, lux∣ury,
and extravagance have overflowed the
different kingdoms and states of Europe.
The springs that fill this reservoir, are no other
than vanity and ignorance. It would be su∣perfluous
to attempt proving from the nature
of things, from the first principles and use
of dress, as well as from the consideration of
natural beauty, and the practice of the an∣cients,
who certainly understood it as well as
the connoisseurs of these days, that nothing
can be more monstrous, inconvenient, and
contemptible, than the fashion of modern
drapery. You yourself are well aware of all
its defects, and have often ridiculed them in
my hearing. I shall only mention one parti∣cular
of dress essential to the fashion in this
country, which seems to me to carry hu∣man
affectation to the very farthest verge of
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
folly and extravagance; that is, the manner
in which the faces of the ladies are primed
and painted. When the Indian chiefs were
in England every body ridiculed their pre∣posterous
method of painting their cheeks
and eye-lids; but this ridicule was wrong
placed. Those critics ought to have consi∣dered,
that the Indians do not use paint to
make themselves agreeable; but in order to
be the more terrible to their enemies. It is
generally supposed, I think, that your sex
make use of <HI>fard</HI> and vermillion for very
different purposes; namely, to help a bad or
faded complexion, to heighten the graces,
or conceal the defects of nature, as well as
the ravages of time. I shall not enquire at
present, whether it is just and honest to im∣pose
in this manner on mankind: if it is not
honest, it may be allowed to be artful and po∣litic,
and shews, at least, a desire of being
agreeable. But to lay it on as the fashion
in France prescribes to all the ladies of con∣dition,
who indeed cannot appear without
this badge of distinction, is to disguise them∣selves
in such a manner, as to render them
odious and detestable to every spectator, who
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
has the least relish left for nature and propriety.
As for the <HI>fard,</HI> or <HI>white,</HI> with which their
necks and shoulders are plaistered, it may be
in some measure excusable, as their skins are
naturally brown, or sallow; but the <HI>rouge,</HI>
which is daubed on their faces, from the chin
up to the eyes, without the least art or dex∣terity,
not only destroys all distinction of fea∣tures,
but renders the aspect really frightful,
or at best conveys nothing but ideas of dis∣gust
and aversion. You know, that without
this horrible masque no married lady is ad∣mitted
at court, or in any polite assembly;
and that it is a mark of distinction which
no bourgeoise dare assume. Ladies of fashion
only have the privilege of exposing themselves
in these ungracious colours. As their faces
are concealed under a false complexion, so
their heads are covered with a vast load of
false hair, which is frizzled on the forehead,
so as exactly to resemble the wooly heads of
the Guinea negroes. As to the natural hue
of it, this is a matter of no consequence,
for powder makes every head of hair of the
same colour; and no woman appears in this
country, from the moment she rises till night,
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
without being compleatly whitened. Pow∣der
or meal was first used in Europe by the
Poles, to conceal their scald heads; but the
present fashion of using it, as well as the mo∣dish
method of dressing the hair, must have
been borrowed from the Hottentots, who
grease their wooly heads with mutton suet,
and then paste it over with the powder called
<HI>buchu.</HI> In like manner, the hair of our fine
ladies is frizzled into the appearance of ne∣groes
wool, and stiffened with an abominable
paste of hog's grease, tallow, and white pow∣der.
The present fashion, therefore, of paint∣ing
the face, and adorning the head, adopted
by the beau monde in France, is taken from
those two polite nations the Chickesaws of
America and the Hottentots of Afric. On
the whole, when I see one of those fine crea∣tures
sailing along, in her taudry robes of
silk and gauze, frilled, and flounced, and
furbelowed, with her false locks, her false
jewels, her paint, her patches, and perfumes;
I cannot help looking upon her as the vil∣est
piece of sophistication that art ever pro∣duced.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108"/>
This hideous masque of painting, though
destructive of all beauty, is, however favour∣able
to natural homeliness and deformity.
It accustoms the eyes of the other sex, and
in time reconciles them to frightful objects;
it disables them from perceiving any distinc∣tion
of features between woman and woman;
and, by reducing all faces to a level, gives e∣very
female an equal chance for an admirer;
being in this particular analagous to the prac∣tice
of the antient Lacedemonians, who
were obliged to chuse their help-mates in the
dark. In what manner the insides of their
heads are furnished, I would not presume to
judge from the conversation of a very few
to whom I have had access: but from the na∣ture
of their education, which I have heard
described, and the natural vivacity of their
tempers, I should expect neither sense, sen∣timent,
nor discretion. From the nursery
they are allowed, and even encouraged, to say
every thing that comes uppermost; by which
means they acquire a volubility of tongue,
and a set of phrases, which constitutes what
is called polite conversation. At the same time
they obtain an absolute conquest over all
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
sense of shame, or rather, they avoid acquir∣ing
this troublesome sensation; for it is cer∣tainly
no innate idea. Those who have not
governesses at home, are sent, for a few
years, to a convent, where they lay in a fund
of superstition that serves them for life: but
I never heard they had the least opportunity
of cultivating the mind, of exercising the
powers of reason, or of imbibing a taste for
letters, or any rational or useful accomplish∣ment.
After being taught to prattle, to dance
and play at cards, they are deemed suffici∣ently
qualified to appear in the <HI>grand monde,</HI>
and to perform all the duties of that high
rank and station in life. In mentioning cards,
I ought to observe, that they learn to play
not barely for amusement, but also with a
view to advantage; and, indeed, you seldom
meet with a native of France, whether male
or female, who is not a compleat gamester,
well versed in all the subtleties and finesses of
the art. This is likewise the case all over
Italy. A lady of a great house in Piedmont,
having four sons, makes no scruple to de∣clare,
that the first shall represent the fami∣ly,
the second enter into the army, the third
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
into the church, and that she will breed
the fourth a gamester. These noble adven∣turers
devote themselves in a particular man∣ner
to the entertainment of travellers from
our country, because the English are supposed
to be full of money, rash, incautious, and
utterly ignorant of play. But such a shar∣per
is most dangerous, when he hunts in
couple with a female. I have known a
French count and his wife, who found means
to lay the most wary under contribution.
He was smooth, supple, officious, and atten∣tive:
she was young, handsome, unprinci∣pled,
and artful. If the Englishman marked
for prey was found upon his guard against
the designs of the husband, then madam
plied him on the side of gallantry. She dis∣played
all the attractions of her person. She
sung, danced, ogled, sighed, complimented,
and complained. If he was insensible to all her
charms, she flattered his vanity, and piqued
his pride, by extolling the wealth and gene∣rosity
of the English; and if he proved
deaf to all these insinuations, she, as her last
stake, endeavoured to interest his humanity
and compassion. She expatiated, with tears
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
in her eyes, on the cruelty and indifference
of her great relations; represented that her
husband was no more than the cadet of a
noble family; that his provision was by no
means suitable, either to the dignity of his
rank, or the generosity of his disposition:
that he had a law-suit of great consequence
depending, which had drained all his fi∣nances;
and, finally, that they should be
both ruined, if they could not find some ge∣nerous
friend, who would accommodate them
with a sum of money to bring the cause to
a determination. Those who are not actu∣ated
by such scandalous motives, become
gamesters from meer habit, and, having no∣thing
more solid to engage their thoughts, or
employ their time, consume the best part of
their lives, in this worst of all dissipation.
I am not ignorant that there are exceptions
from this general rule: I know that France
has produced a Maintenon, a Sevignê, a Scu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eri,
a Dacier, and a Chatelet; but I would
no more deduce the general character of the
French ladies from these examples, than I
would call a field of hemp a flower-gar∣den,
because there might be in it a few <HI>lillies</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
or <HI>renunculas</HI> planted by the hand of acci∣dent.</P>
<P>Woman has been defined a weaker man;
but in this country the men are, in my opi∣nion,
more ridiculous and insignificant than
the women. They certainly are more disa∣greeable
to a rational enquirer, because they
are more troublesome. Of all the coxcombs
on the face of the earth, a French <HI>petit mai∣tre</HI>
is the most impertinent: and they are all
<HI>petit maitres,</HI> from the marquis who glitters
in lace and embroidery, to the <HI>garçon bar∣bier</HI>
covered with meal, who struts with his
hair in a long queue, and his hat under his
arm. I have already observed, that vanity is
the great and universal mover among all ranks
and degrees of people in this nation; and as
they take no pains to conceal or controul it
they are hurried by it into the most ridicu∣lous
and indeed intolerable extravagance.</P>
<P>When I talk of the French nation, I must
again except a great number of individuals
from the general censure. Though I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
hearty contempt for the ignorance, folly, and
presumption which characterise the generali¦ty,
I cannot but respect the talents of man
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
great men, who have eminently distin∣guished
themselves in every art and science:
these I shall always revere and esteem as crea∣tures
of a superior species, produced, for the
wise purposes of providence, among the re∣fuse
of mankind. It would be absurd to con∣clude
that the Welch or Highlanders are a
gigantic people, because those mountains may
have produced a few individuals near seven
feet high. It would be equally absurd to
suppose the French are a nation of philoso∣phers,
because France has given birth to a
Des Cartes, a Maupertuis, a Reaumur, and
a Buffon.</P>
<P>I shall not even deny, that the French are
by no means deficient in natural capacity;
but they are at the same time remarkable
for a natural levity, which hinders their
youth from cultivating that capacity. This
is reinforced by the most preposterous educa∣tion,
and the example of a giddy people,
engaged in the most frivolous pursuits. A
Frenchman is by some Jesuit, or other monk,
taught to read his mother tongue, and to say
his prayers in a language he does not under∣stand.
He learns to dance and to fence, by
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
the masters of those noble sciences. He be∣comes
a compleat connoisseur in dressing hair,
and in adorning his own person, under the
hands and instructions of his barber and
valet de chambre. If he learns to play up∣on
the flute or the fiddle, he is altogether ir∣resistible.
But he piques himself upon being
polished above the natives of any other coun∣try
by his conversation with the fair sex. In
the course of this communication, with which
he is indulged from his tender years, he learns
like a parrot, by rote, the whole circle of
French compliments, which you know are a
set of phrases, ridiculous even to a proverb;
and these he throws out indiscriminately to
all women, without distinction, in the exer∣cise
of that kind of address, which is here
distinguished by the name of gallantry: it
is no more than his making love to every wo∣man
who will give him the hearing. It is
an exercise, by the repetition of which he
becomes very pert, very familiar, and very
impertinent. Modesty, or diffidence, I have
already said, is utterly unknown among them,
and therefore I wonder there should be a term
to express it in their language.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115"/>
If I was obliged to define politeness, I
should call it, the art of making one's self
agreeable. I think it an art that necessarily
implies a sense of decorum, and a delicacy
of sentiment. These are qualities, of which
(as far as I have been able to observe) a
Frenchman has no idea; therefore he never
can be deemed polite, except by those per∣sons
among whom they are as little under∣stood.
His first aim is to adorn his own per∣son
with what he calls fine cloaths, that is
the frippery of the fashion. It is no wonder
that the heart of a female, unimproved by
reason, and untinctured with natural good
sense, should flutter at the sight of such a
gaudy thing, among the number of her ad∣mirers:
this impression is enforced by fustian
compliments, which her own vanity inter∣prets
in a literal sense, and still more con∣firmed
by the assiduous attention of the gal∣lant,
who, indeed, has nothing else to mind.
A Frenchman in consequence of his mingling
with the females from his infancy, not only
becomes acquainted with all their customs
and humours; but grows wonderfully alert
in performing a thousand little offices, which
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
are overlooked by other men, whose time hath
been spent in making more valuable acquisi∣tions.
He enters, without ceremony, a la∣dy's
bed-chamber, while she is in bed, reaches
her whatever she wants, airs her shift, and
helps to put it on. He attends at her toi∣lette,
regulates the distribution of her patches,
and advises where to lay on the paint. If he
visits her when she is dressed, and perceives
the least impropriety in her <HI>coeffure,</HI> he insists
upon adjusting it with his own hands: if
he sees a curl, or even a single hair amiss,
he produces his comb, his scissars, and
pomatum, and sets it to rights with the
dexterity of a professed <HI>friseur.</HI> He squires
her to every place she visits, either on busi∣ness,
or pleasure; and, by dedicating his
whole time to her, renders himself necessary
to her occasions. This I take to be the most
agreeable side of his character: let us view
him on the quarter of impertinence. A French∣man
pries into all your secrets with the most
impudent and importunate curiosity, and then
discloses them without remorse. If you are
indisposed, he questions you about the symp∣toms
of your disorder, with more freedom
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
than your physician would presume to use;
very often in the grossest terms. He then
proposes his remedy (for they are all quacks)
he prepares it without your knowledge, and
worries you with solicitation to take it, with∣out
paying the least regard to the opinion of
those whom you have chosen to take care of
your health. Let you be ever so ill, or a∣verse
to company, he forces himself at all
times into your bed-chamber, and if it is ne∣cessary
to give him a peremptory refusal, he
is affronted. I have known one of those pe∣tit
maitres insist upon paying regular visits
twice a day to a poor gentleman who was
delirious; and he conversed with him on
different subjects, till he was in his last ago∣nies.
This attendance is not the effect of at∣tachment,
or regard, but of sheer vanity,
that he may afterwards boast of his charity
and humane disposition: though, of all the
people I have ever known, I think the French
are the least capable of feeling for the distres∣ses
of their fellow creatures. Their hearts
are not susceptible of deep impressions; and,
such is their levity, that the imagination has
not time to brood long over any disagree∣able
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
idea, or sensation. As a Frenchman
piques himself on his gallantry, he no sooner
makes a conquest of a female's heart, than
he exposes her character, for the gratification
of his vanity. Nay, if he should miscarry
in his schemes, he will forge letters and sto∣ries,
to the ruin of the lady's reputation.
This is a species of perfidy which one would
think should render them odious and detest∣able
to the whole sex; but the case is other∣wise.
I beg your pardon, Madam; but wo∣men
are never better pleased, than when they
see one another exposed; and every individual
has such confidence in her own superior
charms and discretion, that she thinks she
can fix the most volatile, and reform the most
treacherous lover.</P>
<P>If a Frenchman is admitted into your fa∣mily,
and distinguished by repeated marks
of your friendship and regard, the first re∣turn
he makes for your civilities is to make
love to your wife, if she is handsome; if not,
to your sister, or daughter, or niece. If he
suffers a repulse from your wife, or attempts
in vain to debauch your sister, or your daugh∣ter,
or your niece, he will, rather than not
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
play the traitor with his gallantry, make his
addresses to your grandmother; and ten to
one, but in one shape or another, he will
find means to ruin the peace of a family, in
which he has been so kindly entertained. What
he cannot accomplish by dint of compliment,
and personal attendance, he will endeavour
to effect, by reinforcing these with billets-doux,
songs, and verses, of which he always
makes a provision for such purposes. If he is
detected in these efforts of treachery, and re∣proached
with his ingratitude, he impudent∣ly
declares, that what he had done was no
more than simple gallanry, considered in
France as an indispensible duty on every man
who pretended to good breeding. Nay, he
will even affirm, that his endeavours to cor∣rupt
your wife, or deflower your daughter,
were the most genuine proofs he could give
of his particular regard for your family.</P>
<P>If a Frenchman is capable of real friend∣ship,
it must certainly be the most disagree∣able
present he can possibly make to a man of
a true English character. You know, Ma∣dam,
we are naturally taciturn, soon tired of
impertinence, and much subject to fits of
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
disgust. Your French friend intrudes upon
you at all hours: he stuns you with his lo∣quacity:
he teases you with impertinent
questions about your domestic and private
affairs: he attempts to meddle in all your
concerns; and forces his advice upon you
with the most unwearied importunity: he
asks the price of every thing you wear, and,
so sure as you tell him, undervalues it,
without hesitation: he affirms it is in
a bad taste, ill-contrived, ill-made; that
you have been imposed upon both with re∣spect
to the fashion and the price; that the
marquise of this, or the countess of that,
has one that is perfectly elegant, quite in the
<HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n ton,</HI> and yet it cost her little more than
you gave for a thing that nobody would
wear.</P>
<P>If there were five hundred dishes at table,
a Frenchman will eat of all of them, and
then complain he has no appetite. This I
have several times remarked. A friend of mine
gained a considerable wager upon an experi∣ment
of this kind: the petit maitre ate of
fourteen different <HI>plats,</HI> besides the desert;
then disparaged the cook, declaring he was
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
he was no better than a <HI>marmiton,</HI> or turn∣spit.</P>
<P>The French have a most riduculous fond∣ness
for their hair, and this I believe they
inherit from their remote ancestors. The first
race of French kings were distinguished by
their long hair, and certainly the people of
this country consider it as an indispensible
ornament. A Frenchman will sooner part
with his religion than with his hair, which,
indeed, no consideration will induce him to
forego. I know a gentleman afflicted with a
continual head-ach, and a defluxion on his
eyes, who was told by his physician that the
best chance he had for being cured, would be
to have his head close shaved, and bathed e∣very
day in cold water. “How (cried he)
cut my hair? Mr. Doctor, your most hum∣ble
servant!” He dismissed his physician,
lost his eye-sight, and almost his senses, and
is now led about with his hair in a bag, and
a piece of green silk hanging like a screen be∣fore
his face. Count Saxe, and other mili∣tary
writers, have demonstrated the absurdity
of a soldier's wearing a long head of hair;
nevertheless, every soldier in this country wears
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
a long queue, which makes a delicate mark
on his white cloathing; and this ridiculous
foppery has descended even to the lowest class
of people. The <HI>decrotteur,</HI> who cleans your
shoes at the corner of the Pont Neuf, has a
tail of this kind hanging down to his rump,
and even the peasant who drives an ass loaded
with dung, wears his hair <HI>en queue,</HI> though,
perhaps, he has neither shirt nor breeches.
This is the ornament upon which he bestows
much time and pains, and in the exhibition
of which he finds full gratification for his
vanity. Considering the harsh features of the
common people in this country, their dimi∣nutive
stature, their grimaces, and that long
appendage, they have no small resemblance
to large baboons walking upright; and per∣haps
this similitude has helped to entail upon
them the ridicule of their neighbours.</P>
<P>A French friend tires out your patience
with long visits; and, far from taking the
most palpable hints to withdraw, when he
perceives you uneasy, he observes you are low∣spirited,
and therefore declares he will keep
you company. This perseverance shews that
he must either be void of all penetration, or
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
that his disposition must be truly diabolical.
Rather than be tormented with such a fiend,
a man had better turn him out of doors,
even though at the hazard of being run thro'
the body.</P>
<P>The French are generally counted insin∣cere,
and taxed with want of generosity.
But I think these reproaches are not well
founded. High-flown professions of friend∣ship
and attachment constitute the language
of common compliment in this country, and
are never supposed to be understood in the
literal acceptation of the words; and, if
their acts of generosity are but very rare, we
ought to ascribe that rarity, not so much to
a deficiency of generous sentiments, as to
their vanity and ostentation, which engros∣sing
all their funds, utterly disable them from
exerting the virtues of beneficence. Vanity,
indeed, predominates among all ranks, to
such a degree, that they are the greatest <HI>ego∣tists</HI>
in the world; and the most insignificant
individual talks in company with the same
conceit and arrogance, as a person of the
greatest importance. Neither conscious po∣verty
nor disgrace will restrain him in the
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
least either from assuming his full share of
the conversation, or making his addresses to
the finest lady, whom he has the smallest op∣portunity
to approach: nor is he restrained
by any other consideration whatsoever. It
is all one to him whether he himself has a
wife of his own, or the lady a husband;
whether she is designed for the cloister, or
pre-ingaged to his best friend and benefac∣tor.
He takes it for granted that his addres∣ses
cannot but be acceptable; and, if he
meets with a repulse, he condemns her taste;
but never doubts his own qualifications.</P>
<P>I have a great many things to say of their
military character, and their punctilios of
honour, which last are equally absurd and
pernicious; but as this letter has run to an
unconscionable length, I shall defer them till
another opportunity. Mean-while, I have the
honour to be, with very particular esteem,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Mr. M—.
<DATELINE>Lyons, <DATE>October 19, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was favoured with yours at Paris, and
look upon your reproaches as the proof
of your friendship. The truth is, I consi∣dered
all the letters I have hitherto written
on the subject of my travels, as written to
your society in general, though they have
been addressed to one individual of it; and
if they contain any thing that can either a∣muse
or inform, I desire that henceforth all
I send may be freely perused by all the mem∣bers.</P>
<P>With respect to my health, about which
you so kindly enquire, I have nothing new
to communicate. I had reason to think that
my bathing in the sea at Boulogne produced
a good effect, in strengthening my relaxed
fibres. You know how subject I was to colds
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
in England; that I could not stir abroad af∣ter
sun-set, nor expose myself to the smallest
damp, nor walk till the least moisture ap∣peared
on my skin, without being laid up
for ten days or a fortnight. At Paris, how∣ever,
I went out every day, with my hat un∣der
my arm, though the weather was wet
and cold: I walked in the garden at Versailles
even after it was dark, with my head unco∣vered,
on a cold evening, when the ground
was far from being dry: nay, at Marli, I
sauntered above a mile through damp alleys,
and wet grass: and from none of these
risques did I feel the least inconvenience.</P>
<P>In one of our excursions we visited the
manufacture for porcelain, which the king of
France has established at the village of St.
Cloud, on the road to Versailles, and which
is, indeed, a noble monument of his muni∣ficence.
It is a very large building, both
commodious and magnificent, where a great
number of artists are employed, and where
this elegant superfluity is carried to as great
perfection as it ever was at Dresden. Yet,
after all, I know not whether the porcelain
made at Chelsea may not vie with the pro∣ductions
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
either of Dresden, or St. Cloud. If
it falls short of either, it is not in the design,
painting, enamel, or other ornaments, but
only in the composition of the metal, and
the method of managing it in the furnace.
Our porcelain seems to be a partial vitrifica∣tion
of levigated flint and fine pipe clay,
mixed together in a certain proportion; and
if the pieces are not removed from the fire
in the very critical moment, they will be ei∣ther
too little, or too much vitrified. In the
first case, I apprehend they will not acquire a
proper degree of cohesion; they will be apt
to be corroded, discoloured, and to crumble,
like the first essays that were made at Chel∣sea;
in the second case, they will be little
better than imperfect glass.</P>
<P>There are three methods of travelling from
Paris to Lyons, which, by the shortest road
is a journey of about three hundred and
sixty miles. One is by the <HI>diligence,</HI> or stage∣coach,
which performs it in five days; and
every passenger pays one hundred livres, in
consideration of which, he not only has a
seat in the carriage, but is maintained on the
road. The inconveniences attending this
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
way of travelling are these. You are croud∣ed
into the carriage, to the number of eight
persons, so as to sit very uneasy, and some∣times
run the risque of being stifled among
very indifferent company. You are hurried
out of bed, at four, three, nay often at
two o'clock in the morning. You are o∣bliged
to eat in the French way, which is
very disagreeable to an English palate; and,
at Chalons, you must embark upon the Soane
in a boat, which conveys you to Lyons, so
that the two last days of your journey are
by water. All these were insurmountable ob∣jections
to me, who am in such a bad state
of health, troubled with an asthmatic cough,
spitting, slow fever, and restlessness, which
demands a continual change of place, as well
as free air, and room for motion. I was
this day visited by two young gentlemen, sons
of Mr. Guastaldi, late minister from Genoa
at London. I had seen them at Paris, at the
house of the dutchess of Douglas. They
came hither, with their conductor, in the
<HI>diligence,</HI> and assured me, that nothing could
be more disagreeable than their situation in
that carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129"/>
Another way of travelling in this country
is to hire a coach and four horses; and this
method I was inclined to take: but when I
went to the bureau, where alone these voitures
are to be had, I was given to understand,
that it would cost me six-and-twenty guineas,
and travel so slow that I should be ten days
upon the road. These carriages are let by
the same persons who farm the diligence;
and for this they have an exclusive privilege,
which makes them very saucy and insolent.
When I mentioned my servant, they gave
me to understand, that I must pay two loui'∣dores
more for his seat upon the coach box.
As I could not relish these terms, nor brook
the thoughts of being so long upon the road,
I had recourse to the third method, which is
going post.</P>
<P>In England you know I should have had
nothing to do, but to hire a couple of post∣chaises
from stage to stage, with two horses
in each; but here the case is quite otherwise.
The post is farmed from the king, who lays
travellers under contribution for his own be∣nefit,
and has published a set of oppressive
ordonnances, which no stranger nor native
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
dares transgress. The postmaster finds no∣thing
but horses and guides: the carriage
you yourself must provide. If there are
four persons within the carriage, you are o∣bliged
to have six horses, and two postilli∣ons;
and if your servant sits on the outside,
either before or behind, you must pay for a
seventh. You pay double for the first stage
from Paris, and twice double for passing
through Fontainbleau when the court is there,
as well as at coming to Lyons, and at leav∣ing
this city. These are called royal posts
and are undoubtedly a scandalous imposi∣tion.</P>
<P>There are two post roads from Paris to
Lyons, one of sixty-five posts, by the way of
Moulins; the other of fifty-nine, by the way
of Dijon in Burgundy. This last I chose
partly to save sixty livres, and partly to se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the wine harvest of Burgundy, which, I wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
told, was a season of mirth and jollity among
all ranks of people. I hired a very good
coach for ten loui'dores to Lyons, and set out
from Paris on the thirteenth instant, with si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
horses, two postillions, and my own serva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
on horseback. We made no stop at Fontain∣bleau,
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
though the court was there; but lay
at Moret, which is one stage further, a very
paltry little town; where, however, we found
good accommodation.</P>
<P>I shall not pretend to describe the castle or
palace of Fountainbleau, of which I had
only a glimpse in passing; but the forest, in
the middle of which it stands, is a noble
chace of great extent, beautifully wild and
romantic, well stored with game of all sorts,
and abounding with excellent timber. It put
me in mind of the New Forest in Hamp∣shire;
but the hills, rocks, and mountains,
with which it is diversified, render it more
agreeable.</P>
<P>The people of this country dine at noon,
and travellers always find an ordinary pre∣pared
at every <HI>auberge,</HI> or public-house, on
the road. Here they sit down promiscuously,
and dine at so much a head. The usual price
is thirty sols for dinner, and forty for sup∣per,
including lodging; for this moderate
expence they have two courses and a desert.
If you eat in your own apartment, you pay,
instead of forty sols, three, and in some
places, four livres a head. I and my family
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
could not well dispense with our tea and toast
in the morning, and had no stomach to eat
at noon. For my own part, I hate the French
cookery, and abominate garlick, with which
all their ragouts, in this part of the coun∣try,
are highly seasoned: we therefore formed
a different plan of living upon the road. Be∣fore
we left Paris, we laid in a stock of tea,
chocolate, cured neats tongues, and <HI>saucissons,</HI>
or Bologna sausages, both of which we found
in great perfection in that capital, where, in∣deed,
there are excellent provisions of all
sorts. About ten in the morning we stop∣ped
to breakfast at some auberge, where we
always found bread, butter, and milk. In
the mean time, we ordered a <HI>poulard</HI> or two to
be roasted, and these, wrapped in a napkin,
were put into the boot of the coach, toge∣ther
with bread, wine, and water. About
two or three in the afternoon, while the
horses were changing, we laid a cloth upon
our knees, and producing our store, with a
few earthen plates, discussed our short meal
without further ceremony. This was followed
by a desert of grapes and other fruit, which
we had also provided. I must own I found
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
these transient refreshments much more a∣greeable
than any regular meal I ate upon the
road. The wine commonly used in Burgun∣dy
is so weak and thin, that you would not
drink it in England. The very best which
they sell at Dijon, the capital of the province,
for three livres a bottle, is in strength, and
even in flavour, greatly inferior to what I have
drank in London. I believe all the first
growth is either consumed in the houses of
the noblesse, or sent abroad to foreign mar∣kets.
I have drank excellent Burgundy at
Brussels for a florin a bottle; that is, little
more than twenty pence sterling.</P>
<P>The country from the forest of Fountain∣bleau
to the Lyonnois, through which we
passed, is rather agreeable than fertile, being
part of Champagne and the dutchy of Bur∣gundy,
watered by three pleasant pastoral ri∣vers,
the Seine, the Yonne, and the Soane.
The flat country is laid out chiefly for corn;
but produces more rye than wheat. Almost
all the ground seems to be ploughed up, so
that there is little or nothing lying fallow.
There are very few inclosures, scarce any
meadow ground, and, so far as I could ob∣serve,
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
a great scarcity of cattle. We some∣times
found it very difficult to procure half
a pint of milk for our tea. In Burgundy I
saw a peasant ploughing the ground with a
jack-ass, a lean cow, and a he-goat, yoked
together. It is generally observed, that a
great number of black cattle are bred and
fed on the mountains of Burgundy, which
are the highest lands in France; but I saw
very few. The peasants in France are so
wretchedly poor, and so much oppressed by
their landlords, that they cannot afford to
inclose their grounds, or give a proper re∣spite
to their lands; or to stock their farms
with a sufficient number of black cattle to
produce the necessary manure, without which
agriculture can never be carried to any de∣gree
of perfection. Indeed, whatever efforts
a few individuals may make for the benefit
of their own estates, husbandry in France
will never be generally improved, until the
farmer is free and independent.</P>
<P>From the frequency of towns and villages,
I should imagine this country is very popu∣lous;
yet it must be owned, that the towns
are in general thinly inhabited. I saw a good
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
number of country seats and plantations
near the banks of the rivers, on each side;
and a great many convents, sweetly situated,
on rising grounds, where the air is most
pure, and the prospect most agreeable. It
is surprising to see how happy the founders
of those religious houses have been in their
choice of situations, all the world over.</P>
<P>In passing through this country, I was very
much struck with the sight of large ripe
clusters of grapes, entwined with the briars
and thorns of common hedges on the way∣side.
The mountains of Burgundy are co∣vered
with vines from the bottom to the top,
and seem to be raised by nature on purpose
to extend the surface, and to expose it the
more advantageously to the rays of the sun.
The <HI>vandange</HI> was but just begun, and the
people were employed in gathering the
grapes; but I saw no signs of festivity among
them. Perhaps their joy was a little damped
by the bad prospect of their harvest; for
they complained that the weather had been so
unfavourable as to hinder the grapes from
ripening. I thought, indeed, there was some∣thing
uncomfortable in seeing the vintage
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
thus retarded till the beginning of winter:
for, in some parts, I found the weather ex∣tremely
cold; particularly at a place called
Maison-neuve, where we lay, there was a hard
frost, and in the morning the pools were co∣vered
with a thick crust of ice. My perso∣nal
adventures on the road were such as
will not bear a recital. They consisted of
petty disputes with landladies, post-masters,
and postilions. The highways seem to be
perfectly safe. We did not find that any
robberies were ever committed, although we
did not see one of the <HI>marechausse</HI> from Paris
to Lyons. You know the <HI>marechausse</HI> are a
body of troopers well mounted, maintained
in France as safe-guards to the public roads.
It is a reproach upon England that some such
patrol is not appointed for the protection of
travellers.</P>
<P>At Sens in Champagne, my servant, who
had rode on before to bespeak fresh horses,
told me, that the domestic of another com∣pany
had been provided before him, altho'
it was not his turn, as he had arrived later at
the post. Provoked at this partiality, I re∣solved
to chide the post-master, and accord∣ingly
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
addressed myself to a person who stood
at the door of the auberge. He was a jolly
figure, fat and fair, dressed in an odd kind
of garb, with a gold laced cap on his head,
and a cambric handkerchief pinned to his
middle. The sight of such a fantastic petit
maitre, in the character of a post-master, in∣creased
my spleen. I called to him with an
air of authority, mixed with indignation,
and when he came up to the coach, asked in
a peremptory tone, if he did not under∣stand
the king's ordonnance concerning the
regulation of the posts? He laid his hand
upon his breast; but before he could make
any answer, I pulled out the post-book, and
began to read, with great vociferation, the
article which orders, that the traveller who
comes first shall be first served. By this time
the fresh horses being put to the carriage,
and the postilions mounted, the coach set
off all of a sudden, with uncommon speed.
I imagined the post-master had given the fel∣lows
a signal to be gone, and, in this persua∣sion,
thrusting my head out at the window,
I bestowed some epithets upon him, which
must have sounded very harsh in the ears of
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
a Frenchman. We stopped for a refresh∣ment
at a little town called Joigne-ville, where
(by the bye) I was scandalously imposed up∣on,
and even abused by a virago of a land∣lady;
then proceeding to the next stage, I
was given to understand we could not be sup∣plied
with fresh horses. Here I perceived at the
door of the inn, the same person whom I had
reproached at Sens. He came up to the coach,
and told me, that notwithstanding what the
guides had said, I should have fresh horses
in a few minutes. I imagined he was mas∣ter
both of this house and the auberge at
Sens, between which he passed and repassed
occasionally; and that he was now desirous
of making me amends for the affront he
had put upon me at the other place. Ob∣serving
that one of the trunks behind was
a little displaced, he assisted my servant in
adjusting it: then he entered into conversa∣tion
with me, and gave me to understand,
that in a post-chaise, which we had passed,
was an English gentleman on his return from
Italy. I wanted to know who he was, and
when he said he could not tell, I asked
him, in a very abrupt manner, why he
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
had not enquired of his servant. He shrug∣ged
up his shoulders, and retired to the
inn door. Having waited about half an hour,
I beckoned to him, and when he approach∣ed,
upbraided him with having told me that
I should be supplied with fresh horses in a
few minutes: he seemed shocked, and an∣swered,
that he thought he had reason for
what he said, observing, that it was as dis∣agreeable
to him as to me to wait for a relay.
As it began to rain, I pulled up the glass in
his face, and he withdrew again to the door,
seemingly ruffled at my deportment. In a
little time the horses arrived, and three of
them were immediately put to a very hand∣some
post-chaise, into which he stepped, and
set out, accompanied by a man in a rich li∣very
on horseback. Astonished at this cir∣cumstance,
I asked the hostler who he was,
and he replied, that he was a man of fashi∣on
(un seigneur) who lived in the neigh∣bourhood
of Auxerre. I was much morti∣fied
to find that I had treated a nobleman so
scurvily, and scolded my own people for not
having more penetration than myself. I
dare say he did not fail to descant upon the
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
brutal behaviour of the Englishman; and
that my mistake served with him to confirm
the national reproach of bluntness, and ill
breeding, under which we lie in this coun∣try.
The truth is, I was that day more than
usually peevish, from the bad weather, as
well as from the dead of a sit of the asth∣ma,
with which I was threatened: and I
dare say my appearance seemed as uncouth
to him, as his travelling dress appeared to
me. I had a grey mourning frock under a
wide great coat, a bob wig without powder,
a very large laced hat, and a meagre, wrin∣kled,
discontented countenance.</P>
<P>The fourth night of our journey we lay
at Macon, and the next day passed through
the Lyonnois, which is a fine country, full
of towns, villages, and gentlemen's houses.
In passing through the Maconnois, we saw a
great many fields of Indian corn, which
grows to the height of six or seven feet: it
is made into flour for the use of the com∣mon
people, and goes by the name of <HI>Turkey
wheat.</HI> Here likewise, as well as in Dau∣phiné,
they raise a vast quantity of very large
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
pompions, with the contents of which they
thicken their soup and ragouts.</P>
<P>As we travelled only while the sun was
up, on account of my ill health, and the
post horses in France are in bad order, we
seldom exceeded twenty leagues a day.</P>
<P>I was directed to a lodging-house at Ly∣ons,
which being full they shewed us to a
tavern, where I was led up three pair of
stairs, to an apartment consisting of three
paltry chambers, for which the people de∣manded
twelve livres a day: for dinner and
supper they asked thirty-two, besides three
livres for my servant; so that my daily ex∣pence
would have amounted to about forty-seven
livres, exclusive of breakfast and coffee
in the afternoon. I was so provoked at this
extortion, that, without answering one word,
I drove to another auberge, where I now am,
and pay at the rate of two-and-thirty livres
a day, for which I am very badly lodged, and
but very indifferently entertained. I men∣tion
these circumstances to give you an idea
of the imposition to which strangers are sub∣ject
in this country. It must be owned,
however, that in the article of eating, I
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
might save half the money by going to the
public ordinary; but this is a scheme of
economy, which (exclusive of other disa∣greeable
circumstances) neither my own
health, nor that of my wife permits me to
embrace. My journey from Paris to Lyons,
including the hire of the coach, and all ex∣pences
on the road, has cost me, within a
few shillings, forty loui'dores. From Paris
our baggage (though not plombé) was not

the gate of which we were questioned by one
of the searchers, who, being tipt with half a
crown, allowed us to proceed without fur∣ther
enquiry.</P>
<P>I purposed to stay in Lyons until I should
receive some letters I expected from London,
to be forwarded by my banker at Paris: but
the enormous expence of living in this man∣ner
has determined me to set out in a day or
two for Montpellier, although that place is a
good way out of the road to Nice. My rea∣sons
for taking that route I shall communi∣cate
in my next. Mean-while, I am ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>November 5, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE city of Lyons has been so often
and so circumstantially described, that
I cannot pretend to say any thing new on the
subject. Indeed, I know very little of it, but
what I have read in books; as I had but one
day to make a tour of the streets, squares, and
other remarkable places. The bridge over
the Rhone seems to be so slightly built, that I
should imagine it would be one day carried
away by that rapid river; especially as the
arches are so small, that after great rains
they are sometimes <HI>bouchées,</HI> stopped up;
that is, they do not admit a sufficient pas∣sage
for the encreased body of the water. In
order to remedy this dangerous defect, in
some measure, they found an artist some
years ago, who has removed a middle pier,
and thrown two arches into one. This al∣teration
they looked upon as a master-piece
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
in architecture, though there is a com∣mon
mason in England, who would have un∣dertaken
and performed the work, without
valuing himself much upon the enterprize.
This bridge, no more than that of St. Esprit,
is built, not in a strait line across the river,
but with a curve, which forms a convexity to
oppose the current. Such a bend is certainly
calculated for the better resisting the general
impetuosity of the stream, and has no bad
effect to the eye.</P>
<P>Lyons is a great, populous, and flourishing
city; but I am surprised to find it is counted a
healthy place, and that the air of it is esteemed
favourable to pulmonic disorders. It is situ∣ated
on the confluence of two large rivers,
from which there must be a great epavoration,
as well as from the low marshy grounds,
which these rivers often overflow. This must
render the air moist, frouzy, and even putrid,
if it was not well ventilated by winds from
the mountains of Swisserland; and in the lat∣ter
end of autumn, it must be subject to
fogs. The morning we set out from thence,
the whole city and adjacent plains were cover∣ed
with so thick a fog, that we could not
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
distinguish from the coach the head of
the foremost mule that drew it. Lyons is
said to be very hot in summer, and very cold
in winter; therefore I imagine must abound
with inflammatory and intermittent disorders
in the spring and fall of the year.</P>
<P>My reasons for going to Montpellier, which
is out of the strait road to Nice, were
these. Having no acquaintance nor corre∣spondents
in the South of France, I had de∣sired
my credit might be sent to the same
house to which my heavy baggage was con∣signed.
I expected to find my baggage at
Cette, which is the sea-port of Montpellier;
and there I also hoped to find a vessel, in
which I might be transported by sea to Nice,
without further trouble. I longed to try
what effect the boasted air of Montpellier
would have upon my constitution; and I had
a great desire to see the famous monuments
of antiquity in and about the ancient city of
Nismes, which is about eight leagues short
of Montpellier.</P>
<P>At the inn where we lodged, I found a
return berline, belonging to Avignon, with
three mules, which are the animals com∣monly
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
used for carriages in this country
This I hired for five loui'dores. The coac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was large, commodious, and well-fitted; the
mules were strong and in good order; and
the driver, whose name was Joseph, appeared
to be a sober, sagacious, intelligent fellow
perfectly well acquainted with every place in
the South of France. He told me he was
owner of the coach: but I afterwards learn∣ed,
he was no other than a hired servant
I likewise detected him in some knavery,
in the course of our journey; and plainly per∣ceived
he had a fellow-feeling with the inn-keepers
on the road; but, in other respects,
he was very obliging, serviceable, and even
entertaining. There are some knavish
practices of this kind, at which a traveller
will do well to shut his eyes, for his own
ease and convenience. He will be lucky if
he has to do with a sensible knave, like Jo∣seph,
who understood his interest too wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to be guilty of very flagrant pieces of impo∣sition.</P>
<P>A man impatient to be at his journey's
end, will find this a most disagreeable way
of travelling. In summer it must be quite
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
intolerable. The mules are very sure, but
very slow. The journey seldom exceeds eight
leagues, about four and twenty miles a day:
and as those people have certain fixed stages,
you are sometimes obliged to rise in a morn∣ing
before day; a circumstance very grievous
to persons in ill health. These inconveniences,
however, were over-balanced by other <HI>agree∣mens.</HI>
We no sooner quitted Lyons, than we got
into summer weather, and travelling through a
most romantic country, along the banks of the
Rhone, had opportunities (from the slowness of
our pace) to contemplate its beauties at leisure.</P>
<P>The rapidity of the Rhone is, in a great
measure, owing to its being confined within
steep banks on each side. These are formed
almost through its whole course, by a double
chain of mountains, which rise with an abrupt
ascent from both banks of the river. The
mountains are covered with vineyards, inter∣spersed
with small summer-houses, and in
many places they are crowned with churches,
chapels, and convents, which add greatly to the
romantic beauty of the prospect. The high-road,
as far as Avignon, lies along the side of
the river, which runs almost in a straight line,
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
and affords great convenience for inland
commerce. Travellers, bound to the southern
parts of France, generally embark in the
<HI>coche d'eau</HI> at Lyons, and glide down this river
with great velocity, passing a great number
of towns and villages on each side, where
they find ordinaries every day at dinner and
supper. In good weather, there is no danger
in this method of travelling, 'till you come
to the Pont St. Esprit, where the stream runs
through the arches with such rapidity, that
the boat is sometimes overset. But those
passengers who are under any apprehension
are landed above-bridge, and taken in again,
after the boat has passed, just in the same
manner as at London Bridge. The boats that
go up the river are drawn against the stream
by oxen, which swim through one of the
arches of this bridge, the driver sitting be∣tween
the horns of the foremost beast. We
set out from Lyons early <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onday morn∣ing,
and as a robbery had been a few day
before committed in that neighbourhood,
ordered my servant to load my musquetoo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with a charge of eight balls. By the bye
this piece did not fail to attract the curiosit
<PB N="147" REF="149"/>
and admiration of the people in every place
through which we passed. The carriage no
sooner halted, than a crowd immediately sur∣rounded
the man to view the blunderbuss,
which they dignified with the title of <HI>petit
canon.</HI> At Nuys in Burgundy, he fired it in
the air, and the whole mob dispersed, and
scampered off like a flock of sheep. In our
journey hither, we generally set out in a
morning at eight o'clock, and travelled 'till
noon, when the mules were put up and rested
a couple of hours. During this halt, Joseph
went to dinner, and we went to breakfast,
after which we ordered provision for our
refreshment in the coach, which we took
about three or four in the afternoon, halting
for that purpose, by the side of some transpa∣rent
brook, which afforded excellent water
to mix with our wine. In this country I was
almost poisoned with garlic, which they mix
in their ragouts, and all their sauces; nay,
the smell of it perfumes the very chambers,
as well as every person you approach. I was
also very sick of <HI>beca ficas, grieves,</HI> and other
little birds, which are served up twice a day
at all ordinaries on the road. They make
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
their appearance in vine-leaves, and are al∣ways
half raw, in which condition the French
choose to eat them, rather than run the risque
of losing the juice by over-roasting.</P>
<P>The peasants on the South of France are
poorly clad, and look as if they were half
starved, diminutive, swarthy, and meagre;
and yet the common people who travel, live
luxuriously on the road. Every carrier and
mule-driver has two meals a day, consisting
each of a couple of courses and a desert, with
tolerable small wine.—That which is called
<HI>hermitage,</HI> and grows in this province of
Dauphiné, is sold on the spot for three livres
a bottle. The common draught, which you
have at meals in this country, is remarkably
strong, though in flavour much inferior to
that of Burgundy. The accommodation is
tolerable, though they demand (even in
this cheap country) the exorbitant price of
four livres a head for every meal, of those
who choose to eat in their own apart∣ments.
I insisted, however, upon paying
them with three, which they received, though
not without murmuring and seeming discon∣tented.
In this journey, we found plenty of
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
good mutton, pork, poultry, and game, in∣cluding
the red partridge, which is near twice
as big as the partridge of England. Their
hares are likewise surprisingly large and juicy.
We saw great flocks of black turkeys feeding
in the fields, but no black cattle; and milk
was so scarce, that sometimes we were obliged
to drink our tea without it.</P>
<P>One day perceiving a meadow on the side
of the road, full of a flower which I took to
be the crocus, I desired my servant to alight
and pull some of them. He delivered the
musquetoon to Joseph, who began to tamper
with it, and off it went with a prodigious
report, augmented by an eccho from the mountains
that skirted the road. The mules
were so frightened, that they went off at the
gallop; and Joseph, for some minutes, could
neither manage the reins, nor open his mouth.
At length he recollected himself, and the cattle
were stopt, by the assistance of the servant,
to whom he delivered the musquetoon, with
a significant shake of the head. Then alight∣ing
from the box, he examined the heads of
his three mules, and kissed each of them in
his turn. Finding they had received no da∣mage,
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
he came up to the coach, with a pale
visage and staring eyes, and said it was God's
mercy he had not killed his beasts. I an∣swered,
that it was a greater mercy he had
not killed his passengers; for the muzzle of
the piece might have been directed our way
as well as any other, and in that case Joseph
might have been hanged for murder. “I had
as good be hanged (said he) for murder, as
be ruined by the loss of my cattle.” This
adventure made such an impression upon him,
that he recounted it to every person we met;
nor would he ever touch the blunderbuss
from that day. I was often diverted with the
conversation of this fellow, who was very
arch and very communicative. Every af∣ternoon,
he used to stand upon the foot-board,
at the side of the coach, and discourse
with us an hour together. Passing by the
gibbet of Valencia, which stands very near
the high-road, we saw one body hanging
quite naked, and another lying broken on
the wheel. I recollected, that Mandrin had
suffered in this place, and calling to Joseph
to mount the foot-board, asked if he had ever
seen that famous adventurer. At mention of
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
the name of Mandrin, the tear started in
Joseph's eye, he discharged a deep sigh, or
rather groan, and told me he was his dear
friend. I was a little startled at this declara∣tion;
however, I concealed my thoughts, and
began to ask questions about the character
and exploits of a man who had made such
noise in the world.</P>
<P>He told me, Mandrin was a native of Va∣lencia,
of mean extraction: that he had served
as a soldier in the army, and afterwards acted
as <HI>maltotier,</HI> or tax-gatherer: that at length
he turned <HI>contrebandier,</HI> or smuggler, and by
his superior qualities, raised himself to the
command of a formidable gang, consisting
of five hundred persons well armed with car∣bines
and pistols. He had fifty horse for his
troopers, and three hundred mules for the
carriage of his merchandize. His head-quarters
were in Savoy: but he made incur∣sions
into Dauphiné, and set the <HI>marechaussee</HI>
at defiance. He maintained several bloody
skirmishes with these troopers, as well as
with other regular detachments, and in all
those actions signalized himself by his cou∣rage
and conduct. Coming up at one time
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
with fifty of the <HI>marechaussee,</HI> who were in
quest of him, he told them very calmly, he
had occasion for their horses and acoutre∣ments,
and desired them to dismount. At
that instant his gang appeared, and the
troopers complied with his request, without
making the least opposition. Joseph said he
was a generous as he was brave, and never
molested travellers, nor did the least injury
to the poor; but, on the contrary, relieved
them very often. He used to oblige the gen∣tlemen
in the country to take his merchan∣dize,
his tobacco, brandy, and muslins, at
his own price; and, in the same manner,
he laid the open towns under contribution.
When he had no merchandize, he borrowed
money of them upon the credit of what he
should bring when he was better provided.
He was at last betrayed, by his wench, to the
colonel of a French regiment, who went
with a detachment in the night to the place
where he lay in Savoy, and surprized him in
a wood-house, while his people were absent
in different parts of the country. For this
intrusion, the court of France made an apo∣logy
to the king of Sardinia, in whose ter∣ritories
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
he was taken. Mandrin being con∣veyed
to Valencia, his native place, was for
some time permitted to go abroad, under a
strong guard, with chains upon his legs;
and here he conversed freely with all sorts of
people, flattering himself with the hopes of
a pardon, in which, however, he was disap∣pointed.
An order came from court to bring
him to his trial, when he was found guilty,
and condemned to be broke on the wheel.
Joseph said he drank a bottle of wine with
him the night before his execution. He bore
his fate with great resolution, observing that
if the letter which he had written to the King,
had been delivered, he certainly should have
obtained his Majesty's pardon. His execu∣tioner
was one of his own gang, who was
pardoned on condition of performing this
office. You know, that criminals broke up∣on
the wheel are first strangled, unless the
sentence imports, that they shall be broke
alive. As Mandrin had not been guilty of
cruelty in the course of his delinquency, he
was indulged with this favour. Speaking
to the executioner, whom he had formerly
commanded, “Joseph (dit il) je ne veux
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
pas que tu me touche, jusq'uà ce que je sois
roid mort.” Joseph, said he, thou shalt not
touch me till I am quite dead.—Our driver
had no sooner pronounced these words, than
I was struck with a suspicion, that he him∣self
was the executioner of his friend Man∣drin.
On that suspicion, I exclaimed, “ah! ah!
Joseph!” The fellow blushed up to the eyes,
and said, <HI>oui, son nom etoit Joseph aussi bien que
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mien.</HI> I did not think proper to prosecute
the inquiry; but did not much relish the
nature of Joseph's connexions. The truth
is, he had very much the looks of a ruffian;
though, I must own, his behaviour was very
obliging and submissive.</P>
<P>On the fifth day of our journey, in the
morning, we passed the famous bridge at
St. Esprit, which to be sure is a great curio∣sity,
from its length, and the number of its
arches: but these arches are too small: the
passage above is too narrow; and the whole
appears to be too slight, considering the force
and impetuosity of the river. It is not com∣parable
to the bridge at Westminster, either
for beauty or solidity. Here we entered Lan∣guedoc,
and were stopped to have our baggage
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
examined: but the searcher being tipped
with a three-livre piece, allowed it to pass.
—Before we leave Dauphiné, I must observe,
that I was not a little surprized to see figs
and chesnuts growing in the open fields, at
the discretion of every passenger. It was this
day I saw the famous Pont du Garde; but
as I cannot possibly include, in this letter, a
description of that beautiful bridge, and of
the other antiquities belonging to Nismes, I
will defer it till the next opportunity, being,
in the mean time, with equal truth and
affection,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>November 10, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the Pont St. Esprit we entered the
province of Languedoc, and breakfasted
at Bagnole, which is a little paltry town;
from whence, however, there is an excellent
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
road through a mountain, made at a great
expence, and extending about four leagues.
About five in the afternoon, I had the first
glimpse of the famous Pont du Garde, which
stands on the right hand, about the distance
of a league from the post road to Nismes,
and about three leagues from that city. I
would not willingly pass for a false enthusiast
in taste; but I cannot help observing, that
from the first distant view of this noble mo∣nument,
till we came near enough to see it
perfectly, I felt the strongest emotions of
impatience that I had ever known; and
obliged our driver to put his mules to the
full gallop, in the apprehension that it would
be dark before we reached the place. I ex∣pected
to find the building, in some measure,
ruinous; but was agreeably disappointed, to
see it look as fresh as the bridge at Westmin∣ster.
The climate is either so pure and dry,
or the free-stone, with which it is built, so
hard, that the very angles of them remain as
acute as if they had been cut last year. In∣deed,
some large stones have dropped out of
the arches; but the whole is admirably pre∣served,
and presents the eye with a piece of
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
architecture, so unaffectedly elegant, so simple,
and majestic, that I will defy the most phleg∣matic
and stupid spectator to behold it with∣out
admiration. It was raised in the Au∣gustan
age, by the Roman colony of Nismes,
to convey a stream of water between two
mountains, for the use of that city. It stands
over the river Gardon, which is a beautiful
pastoral stream, brawling among rocks, which
form a number of pretty natural cascades,
and overshadowed on each side with trees and
shrubs, which greatly add to the rural beau∣ties
of the scene. It rises in the Cevennes,
and the sand of it produces gold, as we learn
from Mr. Reaumur, in his essay on this sub∣ject,
inserted in the French Memoirs, for the
year 1718.—If I lived at Nismes, or Avig∣non
(which last city is within four short
leagues of it) I should take pleasure in form∣ing
parties to come hither, in summer, to
dine under one of the arches of the Pont
du Garde, on a cold collation.</P>
<P>This work consists of three bridges, or tire
of arches, one above another; the first of
six, the second of eleven, and the third of
thirty-six. The height, comprehending the
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
aqueduct on the top, amounts to 174 feet
three inches: the length between the two
mountains, which it unites, extends to 723.
The order of architecture is the Tuscan: but
the symmetry of it, is inconceivable. By
scooping the bases of the pilasters, of the se∣cond
tire of arches, they had made a passage
for foot-travellers: but though the antients
far excelled us in beauty, they certainly fell
short of the moderns in point of conveniency.
The citizens of Avignon have, in this parti∣cular,
improved the Roman work with a new
bridge by apposition, constructed on the same
plan with that of the lower tire of arches, of
which indeed it seems to be a part, affording
a broad and commodious passage over the
river, to horses and carriages of all kinds.
The aqueduct, for the continuance of which
this superb work was raised, conveyed a stream
of sweet water from the fountain of Eure,
near the city of Uzés, and extended near six
leagues in length.</P>
<P>In approaching Nismes, you see the ruins
of a Roman tower, built on the summit of
a hill, which over-looks the city. It seems
to have been intended, at first, as a watch,
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
or signal-tower, though, in the sequel, it was
used as a fortress: what remains of it, is
about ninety feet high; the architecture of
the Doric order. I no sooner alighted at the
inn, than I was presented with a pamphlet,
containing an account of Nismes and its an∣tiquities,
which every stranger buys. There
are persons too who attend in order to shew
the town, and you will always be accosted by
some shabby antiquarian, who presents you
with medals for sale, assuring you they are
genuine antiques, and were dug out of the
ruins of the Roman temple and baths. All
those fellows are cheats; and they have of∣ten
laid under contribution raw English tra∣vellers,
who had more money than discre∣tion.
To such they sell the vilest and most
common trash: but when they meet with a
connoisseur, they produce some medals which
are really valuable and curious.</P>
<P>Nismes, antiently called Nemausis, was
originally a colony of Roman, settled by
Augustus Caesar, after the battle of Actium.
It is still of considerable extent, and said to
contain twelve thousand families; but the
number seems, by this account, to be greatly
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
exaggerated. Certain it is, the city must
have been formerly very extensive, as appears
from the circuit of the antient walls, the re∣mains
of whieh are still to be seen. Its pre∣sent
size is not one third of its former extent.
Its temples, baths, statues, towers, basilica,
and amphitheatre, prove it to have been a
city of great opulence and magnificence. At
present, the remains of these antiquities are
all that make it respectable or remarkable;
though here are manufactures of silk and
wool, carried on with good success. The
water necessary for these works is supplied
by a source at the foot of the rock, upon
which the tower is placed; and here were
discovered the ruins of Romans baths, which
had been formed and adorned with equal
taste and magnificence. Among the rubbish
they found a vast profusion of columns,
vases, capitals, cornices, inscriptions, medals,
statues, and among other things, the finger
of a colossal statue in bronze, which, ac∣cording
to the rules of proportion, must
have been fifteen feet high. From these
particulars, it appears that the edifices must
have been spacious and magnificent. Part of
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
a tesselated pavement still remains. The an∣tient
pavement of the bath is still intire; all
the rubbish has been cleared away; and the
baths, in a great measure, restored on the
old plan, though they are not at present
used for any thing but ornament. The wa∣ter
is collected into two vast reservoirs, and
a canal built and lined with hewn stone.
There are three handsome bridges thrown
over this vast canal. It contains a great body
of excellent water, which by pipes and other
small branching canals, traverses the town,
and is converted to many different pur∣poses
of oeconomy and manufacture. Be∣tween
the Roman bath and these great canals,
the ground is agreeably laid out in pleasure-walks,
for the recreation of the inhabitants.
Here are likewise ornaments of architecture,
which savour much more of French foppery,
than of the simplicity and greatness of the
antients. It is very surprizing, that this
fountain should produce such a great body
of water, as fills the basin of the source, the
Roman basin, two large deep canals three
hundred feet in length, two vast basins that
make part of the great canal, which is
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
eighteen hundred feet long, eighteen feet
deep, and forty-eight feet broad. When I
saw it, there was in it about eight or nine
feet of water, transparent as crystal. It must
be observed, however, for the honour of
French cleanliness, that in the Roman basin,
through which this noble stream of water
passes, I perceived two washermen at work
upon children's clouts and dirty linnen. Sur∣prized,
and much disgusted at this filthy
phaenomenon, I asked by what means, and
by whose permission, those dirty hags had got
down into the basin, in order to contaminate
the water at its fountain-head; and under∣stood
they belonged to the commandant of
the place, who had the keys of the subterra∣nean
passage.</P>
<P>Fronting the Roman baths are the ruins
of an antient temple, which, according to
tradition, was dedicated to Diana: but it has
been observed by connoisseurs, that all the
antient temples of this goddess were of the
Ionic order; whereas, this is partly Corin∣thian,
and partly composite. It is about
seventy foot long, and six and thirty in
breadth, arched above, and built of large
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
blocks of stone, exactly joined together with∣out
any cement. The walls are still stand∣ing,
with three great tabernacles at the fur∣ther
end, fronting the entrance. On each
side, there are niches in the intercolumnia∣tion
of the walls, together with pedestals
and shafts of pillars, cornices, and an enta∣blature,
which indicate the former magnifi∣cence
of the building. It was destroyed
during the civil war that raged in the reign
of Henry III. of France.</P>
<P>It is amazing, that the successive irruptions
of barbarous nations, of Goths, Vandals,
and Moors; of fanatic croisards, still more
sanguinary and illiberal than those Barbarians,
should have spared this temple, as well as
two other still more noble monuments of
architecture, that to this day adorn the city
of Nismes: I mean the amphitheatre and
the edifice, called <HI>Maison Carrée.</HI>—The for∣mer
of these is counted the finest monu∣ment
of the kind, now extant; and was
built in the reign of Antoninus Pius, who
contributed a large sum of money towards
its erection. It is of an oval figure, one
thousand and eighty feet in circumference,
<PB N="164" REF="166"/>
capacious enough to hold twenty thousand
spectators. The architecture is of the Tuscan
order, sixty feet high, composed of two open
galleries, built one over another, consisting
each of threescore arcades. The entrance
into the arena was by four great gates, with
porticos; and the seats, of which there were
thirty, rising one above another, consisted of
great blocks of stone, many of which still
remain. Over the north gate, appear two
bulls, in <HI>alto relievo,</HI> extremely well executed,
emblems which, according to the custom of
the Romans, signified that the amphitheatre
was erected at the expence of the people.
There are in other parts of it some work in
<HI>bas releif,</HI> and heads or busts but indifferent∣ly
carved. It stands in the lower part of the
town, and strikes the spectator with awe and
veneration. The external architecture is al∣most
intire in its whole circuit; but the arena
is filled up with houses.—This amphithea∣tre
was fortified as a citadel by the Visigoths,
in the beginning of the sixth century. They
raised within it a castle, two towers of which
are still extant; and they surrounded it with
a broad and deep fossée, which was filled up
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
in the thirteenth century. In all the subse∣quent
wars to which this city was exposed,
it served as the last resort of the citizens, and
sustained a great number of successive attacks;
so that its preservation is almost miraculous.
It is likely, however, to suffer much more
from the Gothic avarice of its own citizens,
some of whom are mutilating it every day,
for the sake of the stones, which they employ
in their own private buildings. It is surpriz∣ing,
that the King's authority has not been
exerted to put an end to such sacrilegious vio∣lation.</P>
<P>If the amphitheatre strikes you with an
idea of greatness, the <HI>Maison Carrée</HI> enchants
you with the most exquisite beauties of archi∣tecture
and sculpture. This is an edifice,
supposed formerly to have been erected by
Adrian, who actually built a basilica in this
city, though no vestiges of it remain: but
the following inscription, which was disco∣vered
on the front of it, plainly proves, that
it was built by the inhabitants of Nismes, in
honour of Caius and Lucius Caesar, the
grand-children of Augustus, by his daughter
Julia, the wife of Agrippa.</P>

PRINCIPIBVS IVVENTVTIS.</Q>
<P>This beautiful edifice, which stands upon a
pediment six feet high, is eighty-two feet
long, thirty-five broad, and thirty-seven
high, without reckoning the pediment. The
body of it is adorned with twenty columns
engaged in the wall, and the peristyle, which
is open, with ten detached pillars that sup∣port
the entablature. They are all of the
Corinthian order, fluted and embellished
with capitals of the most exquisite sculpture:
the frize and cornice are much admired, and
the foliage is esteemed inimitable. The pro∣portions
of the building are so happily united,
as to give it an air of majesty and grandeur,
which the most indifferent spectator cannot
behold without emotion. A man needs not
be a connoisseur in architecture, to enjoy these
beauties. They are indeed so exquisite that
you may return to them every day with a
fresh appetite for seven years together. What
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
renders them the more curious, they are still
entire, and very little affected, either by the
ravages of time, or the havoc of war. Car∣dinal
Alberoni declared, that it was a jewel
that deserved a cover of gold to preserve it
from external injuries. An Italian painter,
perceiving a small part of the roof repaired
by modern French masonry, tore his hair,
and exclaimed in a rage, “Zounds! what
do I see? harlequin's hat on the head of Au∣gustus!”</P>
<P>Without all doubt it is ravishingly beau∣tiful.
The whole world cannot parallel it;
and I am astonished to see it standing entire,
like the effects of inchantment, after such a
succession of ages, every one more barbarous
than another. The history of the antiqui∣ties
of Nismes takes notice of a grotesque
statue, representing two female bodies and
legs, united under the head of an old man;
but, as it does not inform us where it is
kept, I did not see it.</P>
<P>The whole country of Languedoc is
shaded with olive trees, the fruit of which
begins to ripen, and appears as black as sloes;
those they pickle are pulled green, and steeped
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
for some time in a lye made of quick lime or
wood ashes, which extracts the bitter taste,
and makes the fruit tender. Without this
preparation it is not eatable. Under the
olive and fig trees, they plant corn and vines,
so that there is not an inch of ground unla∣boured:
but here are no open fields, mea∣dows,
or cattle to be seen. The ground is
overloaded; and the produce of it crowded to
such a degree, as to have a bad effect upon
the eye, impressing the traveller with the ideas
of indigence and rapacity. The heat in sum∣mer
is so excessive, that cattle would find no
green forage, every blade of grass being parched
up and destroyed. The weather was extremely
hot when we entered Montpellier, and put up
at the <HI>Cheval Blanc,</HI> counted the best <HI>auberge</HI>
in the place, tho' in fact it is a most wretched
hovel, the habitation of darkness, dirt, and
imposition. Here I was obliged to pay four
livres a meal for every person in my family,
and two livres at night for every bed, though
all in the same room: one would imagine that
the further we advance to the southward the
living is the dearer, though in fact every ar∣ticle
of housekeeping is cheaper in Languedoc
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
than many other provinces of France. This
imposition is owing to the concourse of En∣glish
who come hither, and, like simple birds
of passage, allow themselves to be plucked by
the people of the country, who know their
weak side, and make their attacks accord∣ingly.
They affect to believe, that all the
travellers of our country are grand seigneurs,
immensely rich and incredibly generous; and
we are silly enough to encourage this opinion,
by submitting quietly to the most ridiculous
extortion, as well as by committing acts of
the most absurd extravagance. This folly
of the English, together with a concourse of
people from different quarters, who come hi∣ther
for the re-establishment of their health,
has rendered Montpellier one of the dearest
places in the South of France. The city, which
is but small, stands upon a rising ground front∣ing
the Mediterranean, which is about three
leagues to the southward: on the other side
is an agreeable plain, extending about the
same distance towards the mountains of the
Cevennes. The town is reckoned well built,
and what the French call <HI>bien percée;</HI> yet the
streets are in general narrow, and the houses
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
dark. The air is counted salutary in catarrhous
consumptions, from its dryness and elasticity:
but too sharp in cases of pulmonary impost∣humes.</P>
<P>It was at Montpellier that we saw for the
first time any signs of that gaiety and mirth
for which the people of this country are cele∣brated.
In all other places through which we
passed since our departure from Lyons, we saw
nothing but marks of poverty and chagrin.
We entered Montpellier on a Sunday, when
the people were all dressed in their best appa∣rel.
The streets were crowded; and a great
number of the better sort of both sexes sat up∣on
stone seats at their doors, conversing with
great mirth and familiarity. These conver∣sations
lasted the greatest part of the night;
and many of them were improved with mu∣sick
both vocal and instrumental: next day
we were visited by the English residing in the
place, who always pay this mark of respect
to new comers. They consist of four or five
families, among whom I could pass the win∣ter
very agreeably, if the state of my health
and other reasons did not call me away.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Mr. L—had arrived two days before me,
troubled with the same asthmatic disorder,
under which I have laboured so long. He
told me he had been in quest of me ever
since he left England. Upon comparing notes,
I found he had stopped at the door of a
country inn in Picardy, and drank a glass
of wine and water, while I was at dinner
up stairs; nay, he had even spoke to my
servant, and asked who was his master,
and the man, not knowing him, replied, he
was a gentleman from Chelsea. He had walk∣ed
by the door of the house where I lodged at
Paris, twenty times, while I was in that city;
and the very day before he arrived at Mont∣pellier,
he had passed our coach on the road.</P>
<P>The garrison of this city consists of two
battalions, one of which is the Irish regi∣ment
of Berwick, commanded by lieutenant
colonel Tents, a gentleman with whom we
contracted an acquaintance at Boulogne. He
treats us with great politeness, and indeed
does every thing in his power to make the
place agreeable to us. The duke of Fitz-James,
the governor, is expected here in a
little time. We have already a tolerable con∣cert
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
twice a week; there will be a comedy
in the winter; and the states of Provence
assemble in January, so that Montpellier will
be extremely gay and brilliant. These very
circumstances would determine me to leave
it. I have not health to enjoy these plea∣sures:
I cannot bear a croud of company,
such as pours in upon us unexpectedly at all
hours; and I foresee, that in staying at Mont∣pellier,
I should be led into an expence, which I
can ill afford. I have therefore forwarded the
letter I received from general P—n, to Mr.
B—d, our consul at Nice, signifying my
intention of going thither, and explaining
the kind of accommodation I would chuse
to have at that place.</P>
<P>The day after our arrival, I procured to∣lerable
lodgings in the High Street, for which
I pay fifty sols, something more than two
shillings per day; and I am furnished with
two meals a day by a <HI>traiteur</HI> for ten livres:
but he finds neither the wine nor the desert;
and indeed we are but indifferently served.
Those families who reside here find their ac∣count
in keeping house. Every traveller
who comes to this, or any other, town in
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
France with a design to stay longer than a
day or two, ought to write beforehand to his
correspondent to procure furnished lodgings,
to which he may be driven immediately, with∣out
being under the necessity of lying in an
execrable inn; for all the inns of this coun∣try
are execrable.</P>
<P>My baggage is not yet arrived by the ca∣nal
of Languedoc; but that gives me no
disturbance, as it is consigned to the care of
Mr. Ray, an English merchant and banker of
this place; a gentleman of great probity and
worth, from whom I have received repeated
marks of uncommon friendship and hospi∣tality.</P>
<P>The next time you hear of me will be from
Nice: mean-while, I remain always,</P>

Your affectionate humble servant.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>November 12.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Flattered myself with the hope of much
amusement during my short stay at Mont∣pellier.—
The University, the Botanical Gar∣den,
the State of Physic in this part of the
world, and the information I received of a
curious collection of manuscripts, among
which I hoped to find something for our
friend Dr. H—r; all these particulars pro∣mised
a rich fund of entertainment, which,
however, I cannot enjoy.</P>
<P>A few days after my arrival, it began to
rain with a southerly wind, and continued
without ceasing the best part of a week, leav∣ing
the air so loaded with vapours, that there
was no walking after sun-set; without being
wetted by the dew almost to the skin. I have
always found a cold and damp atmosphere
the most unfavourable of any to my consti∣tution.
My asthmatical disorder, which had
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
not given me much disturbance since I left
Boulogne, became now very troublesome, at∣tended
with fever, cough, spitting, and low∣ness
of spirits; and I wasted visibly every
day. I was favoured with the advice of Dr.
Fitz-maurice, a very worthy sensible physician
settled in this place: but I had the curiosity
to know the opinion of the celebrated profes∣sor
F—, who is the Boerhaave of Mont∣pellier.
The account I had of his private
character, and personal deportment, from some
English people to whom he was well known,
left me no desire to converse with him: but
I resolved to consult with him on paper. This
great lanthorn of medicine is become very
rich and very insolent; and in proportion as
his wealth increases, he is said to grow the
more rapacious. He piques himself upon be∣ing
very slovenly, very blunt, and very unman∣nerly;
and perhaps to these qualifications he
owes his reputation rather than to any supe∣rior
skill in medicine. I have known them
succeed in our own country▪ and seen a doc∣tor's
parts estimated by his brutality and pre∣sumption.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178"/>
F—is in his person and address not
unlike our old acquaintance Dr. Sm—ie; he
stoops much, dodges along, and affects to
speak the <HI>Patois,</HI> which is a corruption of
the old <HI>Provencial</HI> tongue, spoken by the vul∣gar
in Languedoc and Provence. Notwith∣standing
his great age and great wealth, he
will still scramble up two pair of stairs for a
fee of six livres; and without a fee he will
give his advice to no person whatsoever. He
is said to have great practice in the venereal
branch, and to be frequented by persons of
both sexes infected with this distemper, not
only from every part of France, but also from
Spain, Italy, Germany, and England. I need
say nothing of the Montpellier method of cure,
which is well known at London; but I have
some reason to think the great professor F—,
has, like the famous Mrs. Mapp, the bone∣setter,
cured many patients that were never
diseased.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I sent my <HI>valet de place,</HI>
who was his townsman and acquaintance,
to his house, with the following case, and
a loui'dore.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="179"/>
Annum aetatis, post quadragesimum, tertium.
Temperamentum humidum, crassum, pituitâreple∣tum,
catarrhis saepissime profligatum. Catarrhus,
febre, anxietate et dyspnaea, nunquam non comita∣tus.
Irritatio membranae pituitariae <HI>trachaea∣lis,</HI>

<P>Febre una extinctâ, non deficit altera. Alia∣que

indutum; exercitatio paulullum nimia; ambu∣latio,
equitatio, in quovis vehiculo jactatio; haec
omnia novos motus suscitant. Systema nervosum

praebentia, clauduntur. Materies obstructa cu∣mulatur;
sanguine aliisque humoribus circum∣agitur:
fit plethora. Natura opprimi nolens,
excessus hujus expulsionem conatur. Febris nova
accenditur. Pars oneris, in membranam tra∣chaealem
laxatam ac debilitatam transfertur.
Glandulae pituitariae turgentes bronchia compri∣munt.
Liberum aeri transitum negatur: hinc
respiratio difficilis. Hac vero translatione febris
minuitur: interdiu remittitur. Dyspnaea au∣tem
aliaque symptomata vere hypochondriaca,
recedere nolunt. Vespere febris exacerbatur.
Calor, inquietudo, anxietas et asthma, per no∣dem
grassantur. Ita quotidie res agitur, donec.
Vis vitae paulatim crisim efficit. Seminis jac∣tura,
sive in somniis effusi, seu in gremio veneris
ejaculati, inter causas horum malorum nec non
numeretur.</P>
<P>Quibusdam abhine annis, exercitationibus ju∣venilibus

auxilium tulit. Invasio prima nimium asper∣nata.
Venientibus hostibus non occursum. Cunc∣tando

stomachus perhorrescebat. Gravescente dyspnaea
phlebotomia frustra tentata. Sanguinis missione
vis vitae diminuta: fiebat pulsus debilior, re∣spiratio
difficilior. In pejus ruunt omnia. Fe∣bris
anomala in febriculam continuam mutata.
Dyspnaea confirmata. Fibrarum compages soluta.
Valetudo penitus eversa.</P>
<P>His agitatus furiis, aeger ad mare provolat:
in fluctus se precipitem dat: periculum factum
spem non fefellit: decies iteratum, felix faus∣tumque
evasit. Elater novus fibris conciliatur.
Febricula fugatur. Acris dyspnaea solvitur.
Beneficium dextrâ ripa partum, sinistrâ perdi∣tum.
Superficie corporis, aquae marinae frigore

fibrarum occluduntur: particulis incrementi no∣vis
partes abrasas reficientibus, locus non datur.
Nutritio corporis, via pristina clausâ, qua data
porta ruit: in membranam pulmonum minus fir∣matam
facile fertur, et glandulis per sputum
rejicitur.</P>
<P>Hieme pluviosâ regnante dolores renovantur;
tametsi tempore sereno equitatio profuit. Aestate

Vere novo casus atrox diras procellas a∣nimo

Patriâ relictâ, tristitia, sollecitudo, in∣dignatio,

Rediit febris hectica: rediit asthma cum anxie∣tate,
tusse et dolore lateris lancinanti.</P>
<P>Desperatis denique rebus, iterum ad mare,
veluti ad anceps remedium recurritur. Balneum

Tertio die febris retrocessit. Immersio quotidi∣ana

<P>The professor's eyes sparkled at sight
of the fee; and he desired the servant to call
next morning for his opinion of the case,
which accordingly I received in these words:</P>
<P>“On voit par cette relation que monsieur

tubercules qui peut-etre sont en fonte, ce que
nous aurions determiné si dans la relation on

<P><PB N="182" REF="184"/>
“La cause fonchere de cette maladie doit

J'espere que Mons. F—aura la
bonté de faire revision du memoire, et de

<P>Considering the nature of the case, you
see I could not treat him more civilly. I de∣sired
the servant to ask when he should re∣turn
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
for an answer, and whether he expected
another fee. He desired him to come next
morning, and, as the fellow assured me,
gave him to understand, that whatever mon∣sieur
might send, should be for his (the ser∣vant's)
advantage. In all probability he did
not expect another gratification, to which,
indeed, he had no title. Mons. F—was
undoubtedly much mortified to find himself
detected in such flagrant instances of unjusti∣fiable
negligence, and like all other persons
in the same ungracious dilemma, instead of
justifying himself by reason or argument, had
recourse to recrimination. In the paper which
he sent me next day, he insisted in general
that he had carefully perused the case (which
you will perceive was a self-evident untruth)
he said the theory it contained was idle; that
he was sure it could not be written by a phy∣sician;
that, with respect to the disorder, he
was still of the same opinion; and adhered
to his former prescription; but if I had any
doubts I might come to his house, and he
would resolve them.</P>
<P>I wrapt up twelve livres in the following
note, and sent it to his house.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="191"/>
“C'est ne pas sans raison que monsieur
F—jouit d'un si grande reputation. Je n'ai
plus de doutes, graces à Dieu et a monsieur
F—e.”</P>
<P>To this I received for answer. “Mon∣sieur
n'a plus de doutes: j'en suis charmé.
Receu douze livres. F—, &amp;c.”</P>
<P>Instead of keeping his promise to the valet,
he put the money in his pocket; and the
fellow returned in a rage, exclaiming that he
was <HI>un gros cheval de carosse.</HI></P>
<P>I shall make no other comment upon the
medicines, and the regimen which this great
Doctor prescribed; but that he certainly
mistook the case: that upon the supposition
I actually laboured under a purulent discharge
from the lungs, his remedies savour strongly
of the old woman; and that there is a total
blank with respect to the article of exercise,
which you know is so essential in all pulmo∣nary
disorders. But after having perused my
remarks upon his first prescription, he could
not possibly suppose that I had turbercules, and
was spitting up pus; therefore his persisting
in recommending the same medicines he had
prescribed on that supposition, was a flagrant
<PB N="190" REF="192"/>
absurdity.—If, for example, there was no
<HI>vomica</HI> in the lungs; and the business was to
attenuate the lymph, what could be more
preposterous than to advise the chalk of Brian∣çon,
coral, antihecticum poterii, and the
balm of Canada? As for the turtle-soupe, it
it is a good restorative and balsamic; but, I
apprehend, will tend to thicken rather than
attenuate the phlegm. He mentions not a
syllable of the air, though it is universally
allowed, that the climate of Montpellier is
pernicious to ulcerated lungs; and here I
cannot help recounting a small adventure
which our doctor had with a son of Mr.
O—d, merchant in the city of London. I
had it from Mrs. St—e who was on the spot.
The young gentleman, being consumptive,
consulted Mr. F—, who continued visiting
and prescribing for him a whole month. At
length, perceiving that he grew daily worse,
“Doctor (said he) I take your prescriptions
punctually; but, instead of being the better
for them, I have now not an hour's remis∣sion
from the fever in the four-and-twenty.
—I cannot conceive the meaning of it.”
F—, who perceived he had not long to live,
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
told him the reason was very plain: the air of
Montpellier was too sharp for his lungs,
which required a softer climate. “Then
you're a sordid villain (cried the young man)
for allowing me to stay here till my constitu∣tion
is irretrievable.” He set out immediately
for Tholouse, and in a few weeks died in the
neighbourhood of that city.</P>
<P>I observe that the physicians in this coun∣try
pay no regard to the state of the solids
in chronical disorders: that exercise and the
cold bath are never prescribed: that they
seem to think the scurvy is entirely an Eng∣lish
disease; and that, in all appearance, they
often confound the symptoms of it, with
those of the venereal distemper. Perhaps I
may be more particular on this subject in a
subsequent letter. In the mean time, I am
ever,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>December 6, 176<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inhabitants of Montpellier are so∣ciable,
gay, and good tempered. They
have a spirit of commerce, and have erected
several considerable manufactures in the neigh∣bourhood
of the city. People assemble every
day to take the air on the esplanade, where
there is a very good walk, just without the
gate of the citadel: but, on the other side of
the town, there is another still more agreea∣ble,
called the <HI>peirou,</HI> from whence there is
a prospect of the Mediterranean on one side,
and of the Cevennes on the other. Here is a
good equestrian statue of Louis XIV. front∣ing
one gate of the city, which is built in
form of a triumphal arch, in honour of the
same monarch. Immediately under the <HI>pierou</HI>
is the physic garden, and near it an arcade just
finished for an aqueduct, to convey a stream
of water to the upper parts of the city. Per∣haps
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
I should have thought this a neat piece
of work, if I had not seen the <HI>Pont du Garde:</HI>
but, after having viewed the Roman arches, I
could not look upon this but with pity and
contempt. It is a wonder how the architect
could be so fantastically modern, having such
a noble model, as it were, before his eyes.</P>
<P>There are many protestants at this place,
as well as at Nismes, and they are no longer
molested on the score of religion. They
have their conventicles in the country, where
they assemble privately for worship. These
are well known; and detachments are sent
out every Sunday to intercept them; but
the officer has always private directions to
take another route. Whether this indulgence
comes from the wisdom and lenity of the
government, or is purchased with money
of the commanding officer, I cannot deter∣mine:
but certain it is, the laws of France
punish capitally every protestant minister
convicted of having performed the functions
of his ministry in this kingdom; and one
was hanged about two years ago, in the
neighbourhood of Montauban.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196"/>
The markets in Montpellier are well
supplied with fish, poultry, butcher's
meat, and game, at reasonable rates. The
wine of the country is strong and harsh,
and never drank, but when mixed with wa∣ter.
Burgundy is dear, and so is the sweet
wine of Frontignan, though made in the
neighbourhood of Cette. You know it is
famous all over Europe, and so are the
<HI>liqueurs,</HI> or drams of various sorts, com∣pounded
and distilled at Montpellier. Cette
is the sea-port, about four leagues from that
city: but the canal of Languedoc comes up
within a mile of it; and is indeed a great
curiosity: a work in all respects worthy of
a Colbert, under whose auspices it was
finished. When I find such a general tri∣bute
of respect and veneration paid to the
memory of that great man, I am astonished
to see so few monuments of public utility
left by other ministers. One would imagine,
that even the desire of praise would prompt
a much greater number to exert themselves
for the glory and advantage of their coun∣try;
yet, in my opinion, the French have
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
been ungrateful to Colbert, in the same pro∣portion
as they have over-rated the character
of his master. Through all France one
meets with statues and triumphal arches
erected to Louis XIV. in consequence of his
victories; by which, likewise, he acquired
the title of Louis le Grand. But how were
those victories obtained? Not by any personal
merit of Louis. It was Colbert who im∣proved
his finances, and enabled him to pay
his army. It was Louvois that provided all
the necessaries of war. It was a Condê, a
Turenne, a Luxemburg, a Vendome, who
fought his battles; and his first conquests,
for which he was deified by the pen of adu∣lation,
were obtained almost without blood∣shed,
over weak, dispirited, divided, and
defenceless nations. It was Colbert that im∣proved
the marine, instituted manufactures,
encouraged commerce, undertook works of
public utility, and patronized the arts and
sciences. But Louis (you will say) had the
merit of choosing and supporting those mi∣nisters,
and those generals. I answer, no.
He found Colbert and Louvois already
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
chosen: he found Condê and Turenne in
the very zenith of military reputation. Lux∣emburg
was Conde's pupil; and Vendome,
a prince of the blood, who at first obtained
the command of armies in consequence of
his high birth, and happened to turn out a
man of genius. The same Louis had the
sagacity to revoke the edict of Nantz; to
entrust his armies to a Tallard, a Villeroy,
and a Marsin. He had the humanity to
ravage the country, burn the towns, and
massacre the people of the Palatinate. He
had the patriotism to impoverish and depo∣pulate
his own kingdom, in order to prose∣cute
schemes of the most lawless ambition.
He had the consolation to beg a peace from
those he had provoked to war by the most
outrageous insolence; and he had the glory
to espouse Mrs. Maintenon in her old age,
the widow of the buffoon Scarron. Without
all doubt, it was from irony he acquired the
title <HI>le Grand.</HI></P>
<P>Having received a favourable answer from
Mr. B—, the English consul at Nice, and
recommended the care of my heavy baggage
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
to Mr. Ray, who undertook to send it by sea
from Cette to Villefranche, I hired a coach
and mules for seven loui'dores, and set out
from Montpellier on the 13th of November,
the weather being agreeable, though the air
was cold and frosty. In other respects there
were no signs of winter: the olives were now
ripe, and appeared on each side of the road
as black as sloes; and the corn was already
half a foot high. On the second day of our
journey, we passed the Rhone on a bridge of
boats at Buccaire, and lay on the other side
at Tarrascone. Next day we put up at a
wretched place called Orgon, where, how∣ever,
we were regaled with an excellent sup∣per;
and among other delicacies, with a dish
of green pease. Provence is a pleasant coun∣try,
well cultivated; but the inns are not so
good here as in Languedoc, and few of them
are provided with a certain convenience which
an English traveller can very ill dispense with.
Those you find are generally on the tops of
houses, exceedingly nasty; and so much
exposed to the weather, that a valetudina∣rian
cannot use them without hazard of his
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
life. At Nismes in Languedoc, where we
found the temple of Cloacina in a most
shocking condition, the servant-maid told
me her mistress had caused it to be made on
purpose for the English travellers; but now
she was very sorry for what she had done,
as all the French who frequented her house,
instead of using the seat, left their offerings
on the floor, which she was obliged to have
cleaned three or four times a day. This is
a degree of beastliness, which would appear
detestable even in the capital of North-Bri∣tain.
On the fourth day of our pilgrimage,
we lay in the suburbs of Aix, but did not
enter the city, which I had a great curiosity
to see. The villainous asthma baulked me of
that satisfaction. I was pinched with the
cold, and impatient to reach a warmer cli∣mate.
Our next stage was at a paltry vil∣lage,
where we were poorly entertained. I
looked so ill in the morning, that the good
woman of the house, who was big with
child, took me by the hand at parting, and
even shed tears, praying fervently that God
would restore me to my health. This was
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
the only instance of sympathy, compassion,
or goodness of heart, that I had met with
among the publicans of France. Indeed, at
Valencia, our landlady understanding I was
travelling to Montpellier for my health,
would have dissuaded me from going thither;
and exhorted me, in particular, to beware
of the physicians, who were all a pack of
assassins. She advised me to eat fricassees of
chickens, and white meat, and to take a
good <HI>bouillon</HI> every morning.</P>
<P>A <HI>bouillon</HI> is an universal remedy among
the good people of France; insomuch, that
they have no idea of any person's dying,
after having swallowed <HI>un bon bouillon.</HI> One
of the English gentlemen, who were robbed
and murdered about thirty years ago between
Calais and Boulogne, being brought to the
post-house of Boulogne with some signs of
life, this remedy was immediately adminis∣tred.
“What surprises me greatly, (said the
post-master, speaking of this melancholy
story to a friend of mine, two years after
it happened) I made an excellent <HI>bouillon,</HI>
and poured it down his throat with my own
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
hands, and yet he did not recover.” Now,
in all probability, this <HI>bouillon</HI> it was that
stopped his breath. When I was a very
young man, I remember to have seen a per∣son
suffocated by such impertinent officious∣ness.
A young man of uncommon parts
and erudition, very well esteemed at the
university of G—ow, was found early
one morning in a subterranean vault among
the ruins of an old archiepiscopal palace,
with his throat cut from ear to ear. Being
conveyed to a public-house in the neighbour∣hood,
he made signs for pen, ink, and pa∣per,
and in all probability would have ex∣plained
the cause of this terrible catastrophe,
when an old woman, seeing the windpipe
which was cut, sticking out of the wound,
and mistaking it for the gullet, by way of
giving him a cordial to support his spirits,
poured into it, through a small funnel, a
glass of burnt brandy, which strangled him
in the tenth part of a minute. The gash
was so hideous, and formed by so many re∣peated
strokes of a razor, that the surgeons
believed he could not possibly be the perpe∣trator
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
himself; nevertheless, this was certainly
the case.</P>
<P>At Brignolles, where we dined, I was
obliged to quarrel with the landlady, and
threaten to leave her house, before she would
indulge us with any sort of flesh-meat. It
was meagre day, and she had made her pro∣vision
accordingly. She even hinted some
dissatisfaction at having heretics in her house:
but, as I was not disposed to eat stinking
fish, with ragouts of eggs and onions, I in∣sisted
upon a leg of mutton, and a brace of
fine partridges, which I found in the larder.
Next day, when we set out in the morning
from Luc, it blew a north-westerly wind so
extremely cold and biting, that even a flan∣nel
wrapper could not keep me tolerably
warm in the coach. Whether the cold had
put our coachman in a bad humour, or he
had some other cause of resentment against
himself, I know not; but we had not gone
above a quarter of a mile, when he drove
the carriage full against the corner of a gar∣den
wall, and broke the axle-tree, so that
we were obliged to return to the inn on foot,
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
and wait a whole day, until a new piece
could be made and adjusted. The wind
that blew, is called <HI>Maestral,</HI> in the Provin∣cial
dialect, and indeed is the severest that
ever I felt. At this inn, we met with a
young French officer who had been a prisoner
in England, and spoke our language pretty
well. He told me, that such a wind did not
blow above twice or three times in a winter,
and was never of long continuance: that in
general, the weather was very mild and
agreeable during the winter months; that
living was very cheap in this part of Pro∣vence,
which afforded great plenty of game.
Here, too, I found a young Irish recollet, in
his way from Rome to his own country. He
complained, that he was almost starved by
the inhospitable disposition of the French
people; and that the regular clergy, in par∣ticular,
had treated him with the most crue
disdain. I relieved his necessities, and gave
him a letter to a gentleman of his own coun∣try
at Montpellier.</P>
<P>When I rose in the morning, and opened
a window that looked into the garden,
thought myself either in a dream, or be
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
witched. All the trees were cloathed with
snow, and all the country covered at least a
foot thick. “This cannot be the south of
France, (said I to myself) it must be the
Highlands of Scotland!” At a wretched
town called Muy, where we dined, I had a
warm dispute with our landlord, which,
however, did not terminate to my satisfac∣tion.
I sent on the mules before, to the next
stage, resolving to take post-horses, and be∣spoke
them accordingly of the aubergiste,
who was, at the same time, inn-keeper and
post-master. We were ushered into the
common eating-room, and had a very indif∣ferent
dinner; after which, I sent a loui'dore
to be changed, in order to pay the reckoning.
The landlord, instead of giving the full
change, deducted three livres a head for din∣ner,
and sent in the rest of the money by
my servant. Provoked more at his ill man∣ners,
than at his extortion, I ferretted him
out of a bed-chamber, where he had con∣cealed
himself, and obliged him to restore
the full change, from which I paid him at
the rate of two livres a head. He refused
to take the money, which I threw down on
<PB N="204" REF="206"/>
the table; and the horses being ready,
stepped into the coach, ordering the postili∣ons
to drive on. Here I had certainly reck∣oned
without my host. The fellows declared
they would not budge, until I should pay
their master; and as I threatened them with
manual chastisement, they alighted, and
disappeared in a twinkling. I was now so
incensed, that though I could hardly breathe;
though the afternoon was far advanced, and
the street covered with wet snow, I walked
to the consul of the town, and made my
complaint in form. This magistrate, who
seemed to be a taylor, accompanied me to
the inn, where by this time the whole town
was assembled, and endeavoured to persuade
me to compromise the affair. I said, as he
was the magistrate, I would stand to his
award. He answered, “that he would not
presume to determine what I was to pay.”
I have already paid him a reasonable price for
his dinner, (said I) and now I demand post-horses
according to the king's ordonnance.
The aubergiste said the horses were ready,
but the guides were run away; and he could
not find others to go in their place. I argued
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
with great vehemence, offering to leave a
loui'dore for the poor of the parish, pro∣vided
the consul would oblige the ras∣cal
to do his duty. The consul shrugged
up his shoulders, and declared it was not in
his power. This was a lie, but I perceived
he had no mind to disoblige the publican.
If the mules had not been sent away, I
should certainly have not only payed what I
thought proper, but corrected the landlord
into the bargain, for his insolence and ex∣tortion;
but now I was entirely at his
mercy, and as the consul continued to ex∣hort
me in very humble terms, to comply
with his demands, I thought proper to ac∣quiesce.
Then the postilions immediately
appeared: the crowd seemed to exult in the
triumph of the aubergiste; and I was
obliged to travel in the night, in very severe
weather, after all the fatigue and mortifica∣tion
I had undergone.</P>
<P>We lay at Frejus, which was the <HI>Forum
Julianum</HI> of the antients, and still boasts of
some remains of antiquity; particularly the
ruins of an amphitheatre, and an aqueduct.
The first we passed in the dark, and next
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
morning the weather was so cold that I could
not walk abroad to see it. The town is at
present very inconsiderable, and indeed in a
ruinous condition. Nevertheless, we were
very well lodged at the post-house, and treated
with more politeness than we had met with
in any other part of France.</P>
<P>As we had a very high mountain to
ascend in the morning, I ordered the mules
on before to the next post, and hired six
horses for the coach. At the east end of
Frejus, we saw close to the road on our left-hand,
the arcades of the antient aqueduct,
and the ruins of some Roman edifices, which
seemed to have been temples. There was
nothing striking in the architecture of the
aqueduct. The arches are small and low,
without either grace or ornament, and seem
to have been calculated for mere utility.</P>
<P>The mountain of Esterelles, which is
eight miles over, was formerly frequent∣ed
by a gang of desperate banditti, who are
now happily exterminated: the road is very
good, but in some places very steep and
bordered by precipices. The mountain is
covered with pines, and the <HI>laurus cerasus,</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
the fruit of which being now ripe, made a
most romantic appearance through the snow
that lay upon the branches. The cherries
were so large that I at first mistook them for
dwarf oranges. I think they are counted
poisonous in England, but here the people
eat them without hesitation. In the middle
of the mountain is the post-house, where
we dined in a room so cold, that the bare
remembrance of it makes my teeth chatter.
After dinner I chanced to look into another
chamber that fronted the south, where the
sun shone; and opening a window perceiv∣ed,
within a yard of my hand, a large tree
loaded with oranges, many of which were
ripe. You may judge what my astonish∣ment
was to find Winter in all his rigour
reigning on one side of the house, and Sum∣mer
in all her glory on the other. Certain
it is, the middle of this mountain seemed to
be the boundary of the cold weather. As
we proceeded slowly in the afternoon we
were quite enchanted. This side of the hill
is a natural plantation of the most agreeable
ever-greens, pines, firs, laurel, cypress,
sweet myrtle, tamarisc, box, and juniper,
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
interspersed with sweet marjoram, lavender,
thyme, wild thyme, and sage. On the right-hand
the ground shoots up into agreeable
cones, between which you have delightful
vistas of the Mediterranean, which washes
the foot of the rock; and between two di∣visions
of the mountains, there is a bottom
watered by a charming stream, which greatly
adds to the rural beauties of the scene.</P>
<P>This night we passed at Cannes, a little
fishing town, agreeably situated on the beach
of the sea, and in the same place lodged
Monsieur Nadeau d'Etrueil, the unfortunate
French governor of Guadeloupe, condemn∣ed
to be imprisoned for life in one of the
isles Muaguerite, which lie within a mile of
this coast.</P>
<P>Next day we journeyed by the way of
Antibes, a small maritime town, tolerably
well fortified; and passing the little river
Loup, over a stone-bridge, arrived about
noon at the village of St. Laurent, the extre∣mity
of France, where we passed the Var,
after our baggage had undergone examina∣tion.
From Cannes to this village the road
lies along the sea-side; and sure nothing can
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
be more delightful. Though in the morning
there was a frost upon the ground, the sun
was as warm as it is in May in England. The
sea was quite smooth, and the beach formed
of white polished pebbles; on the left-hand
the country was covered with green olives, and
the side of the road planted with large trees
of sweet myrtle growing wild like the haw∣thorns
in England. From Antibes we had
the first view of Nice, lying on the opposite
side of the bay, and making a very agree∣able
appearance. The author of the Grand
Tour says, that from Antibes to Nice the
roads are very bad, through rugged moun∣tains
bordered with precipices on the left, and
by the sea to the right; whereas, in fact,
there is neither precipice nor mountain near
it.</P>
<P>The Var, which divides the county of
Nice from Provence, is no other than a tor∣rent
fed chiefly by the snow that melts on
the maritime Alps, from which it takes its
origin. In the summer it is swelled to a
dangerous height, and this is also the case
after heavy rains: but at present the middle
of it is quite dry, and the water divided into
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
two or three narrow streams, which, however,
are both deep and rapid. This river has
been absurdly enough by some supposed the
Rubicon, in all probability from the descrip∣tion
of that river in the Pharsalia of Lucan,
who makes it the boundary betwixt Gaul and
Italy—
<Q><L>—et Gallica certus</L>
<L>Limes ab Aufoniis disterminat arva colonis;</L></Q>
whereas, in fact, the Rubicon, now called
Pisatello, runs between Ravenna and Ri∣mini.—
But to return to the Var. At the
village of St. Laurent, famous for its Mus∣cadine
wines, there is a set of guides always
in attendance to conduct you in your passage
over the river. Six of those fellows, tucked
up above the middle, with long poles in
their hands, took charge of our coach, and
by many windings guided it safe to the op∣posite
shore. Indeed there was no occasion for
any; but it is a sort of a perquisite, and I did not
choose to run any risque, how small soever
it might be, for the sake of saving half a
crown, with which they were satisfied. If
you do not gratify the searchers at St. Lau∣rent
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
with the same sum, they will rummage
your trunks, and turn all your cloaths
topsy turvy. And here, once for all, I would
advise every traveller who consults his own
ease and convenience, to be liberal of his mo∣ney
to all that sort of people; and even to
wink at the imposition of aubergistes on the
road, unless it be very flagrant. So sure as
you enter into disputes with them, you will
be put to a great deal of trouble, and fret
yourself to no manner of purpose. I have
travelled with oeconomists in England, who
declared they would rather give away a crown
than allow themselves to be cheated of a
farthing. This is a good maxim, but requires
a great share of resolution and self-denial to
put in practice in one excursion. My fellow-traveller
was in a passion, and of consequence
very bad company from one end of the
journey to the other. He was incessantly
scolding either at landlords, landladies,
waiters, hostlers, or postilions. We had
bad horses, and bad chaises; set out from
every stage with the curses of the people;
and at this expence I saved about ten shil∣lings
in a journey of a hundred and fifty
<PB N="212" REF="214"/>
miles. For such a paltry consideration, he
was contented to be miserable himself, and
to make every other person unhappy with
whom he had any concern. When I came
last from Bath it rained so hard, that the
postilion who drove the chaise was wet to
the skin before we had gone a couple of
miles. When we arrived at the Devizes, I
gave him two shillings instead of one, out
of pure compassion. The consequence of
this liberality was, that in the next stage we
seemed rather to fly than to travel upon solid
ground. I continued my bounty to the se∣cond
driver, and indeed through the whole
journey, and found myself accommodated
in a very different manner from what I had
experienced before. I had elegant chaises,
with excellent horses; and the postilions of
their own accord used such diligence, that
although the roads were broken by the rain,
I travelled at the rate of twelve miles an
hour; and my extraordinary expence from
Bath to London, amounted precisely to six
shillings.</P>
<P>The river Var falls into the Mediterranean
a little below St. Laurent, about four miles
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
to the westward of Nice. Within the me∣mory
of persons now living, there have been
three wooden bridges thrown over it, and as
often destroyed in consequence of the jea∣lousy
subsisting between the kings of France
and Sardinia; this river being the boundary
of their dominions on the side of Provence.
However, this is a consideration that ought
not to interfere with the other advantages
that would accrue to both kingdoms from
such a convenience. If there was a bridge
over the Var, and a post-road made from
Nice to Genoa, I am very confident that all
those strangers who now pass the Alps in
their way to and from Italy, would choose
this road as infinitely more safe, commodious,
and agreeable. This would also be the case
with all those who hire felucas from Mar∣seilles
or Antibes, and expose themselves to
the dangers and inconveniences of travelling
by sea in an open boat.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we arrived at Nice, where
we found Mr. M—e, the English gen∣tleman
whom I had seen at Boulogne, and
advised to come hither. He had followed
my advice, and reached Nice about a month
<PB N="214" REF="216"/>
before my arrival, with his lady, child, and
an old gouvernante. He had travelled with
his own post-chaise and horses, and is now
lodged just without one of the gates of the
city, in the house of the count de V—n,
for which he pays five loui'dores a month.
I could hire one much better in the neighbour∣hood
of London, for the same money. Un∣less
you will submit to this extortion, and
hire a whole house for a length of time, you
will find no ready-furnished lodgings at Nice.
After having stewed a week in a paltry inn,
I have taken a ground floor for ten months
at the rate of four hundred livres a year,
that is precisely twenty pounds sterling, for
the Piedmontese livre is exactly an English
shilling. The apartments are large, lofty,
and commodious enough, with two small
gardens, in which there is plenty of sallad,
and a great number of oranges and lemons:
but as it required some time to provide fur∣niture,
our consul Mr. B—d, one of the
best natured and most friendly men in the
world, has lent me his lodgings, which are
charmingly situated by the sea-side, and open
upon a terrace, that runs parallel to the
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
beach, forming part of the town wall.
Mr. B—d himself lives at Villa Franca,
which is divided from Nice by a single moun∣tain,
on the top of which there is small
fort, called the castle of Montalban. Im∣mediately
after our arrival we were visited
by one Mr. de Martines, a most agreeable
young fellow, a lieutenant in the Swiss regi∣ment,
which is here in garrison. He is a
Protestant, extremely fond of our nation,
and understands our language tolerably well.
He was particularly recommended to our
acquaintance by general P—and his lady;
we are happy in his conversation; find him
wonderfully obliging, and extremely service∣able
on many occasions. We have likewise
made acquaintance with some other indivi∣duals,
particularly with Mr. St. Pierre, junior,
who is a considerable merchant, and consul
for Naples. He is a well-bred, sensible
young man, speaks English, is an excellent
performer on the lute and mandolin, and has
a pretty collection of books. In a word, I
hope we shall pass the winter agreeably
enough, especially if Mr. M—e should
hold out; but I am afraid he is too far gone
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
in a consumption to recover. He spent the
last winter at Nismes, and consulted F—at
Montpellier. I was impatient to see the
prescription, and found it almost verbatim
the same he had sent to me; although I am
persuaded there is a very essential difference
between our disorders. Mr. M—e has
been long afflicted with violent spasms,
colliquative sweats, prostration of appetite,
and a disorder in his bowels. He is likewise
jaundiced all over, and I am confident his
liver is unsound. He tried the tortoise soup,
which he said in a fortnight stuffed him up
with phlegm. This gentleman has got a
smattering of physic, and I am afraid tempers
with his own constitution, by means of
Brookes's Practice of Physic, and some dis∣pensatories,
which he is continually poring
over. I beg pardon for this tedious epistle,
and am,</P>
<CLOSER>Very sincerely, dear Sir,
Your affectionate,
Humble servant.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 15, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am at last settled at Nice, and have leisure
to give you some account of this very
remarkable place. The county of Nice ex∣tends
about fourscore miles in length, and
in some places it is thirty miles broad. It
contains several small towns, and a great
number of villages; all of which, this ca∣pital
excepted, are situated among moun∣tains,
the most extensive plain of the whole
country being this where I now am, in the
neighbourhood of Nice. The length of it
does not exceed two miles, nor is the breadth
of it, in any part, above one. It is bound∣ed
by the Mediterranean on the south. From
the sea-shore, the maritime Alps begin with
hills of a gentle ascent, rising into moun∣tains
that form a sweep or amphitheatre
ending at Montalban, which over-hangs the
town of Villa Franca. On the west side
of this mountain, and in the eastern extre∣mity
of the amphitheatre, stands the city of
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
Nice, wedged in between a steep rock and
the little river Paglion, which descends from
the mountains, and washing the town-walls
on the west side, falls into the sea, after
having filled some canals for the use of the
inhabitants. There is a stone-bridge of three
arches over it, by which those who come
from Provence enter the city. The channel
of it is very broad, but generally dry in
many places; the water (as in the Var) di∣viding
itself into several small streams. The
Paglion being fed by melted snow and rain
in the mountains, is quite dry in summer;
but it is sometimes swelled by sudden rains
to a very formidable torrent. This was the
case in the year 1744, when the French and
Spanish armies attacked eighteen Piedmon∣tese
battalions, which were posted on the
side of Montalban. The assailants were re∣pulsed
with the loss of four thousand men,
some hundreds of whom perished in repassing
the Paglion, which had swelled to a surprising
degree during the battle, in consequence of
a heavy continued rain. This rain was of
great service to the Piedmontese, as it pre∣vented
one half of the enemy from passing
<PB N="219" REF="221"/>
the river to sustain the other. Five hundred
were taken prisoners: but the Piedmontese,
foreseeing they should be surrounded next
day by the French, who had penetrated be∣hind
them, by a pass in the mountains, re∣tired
in the night. Being received on board
the English fleet, which lay at Villa Franca,
they were conveyed to Oneglia. In examin∣ing
the bodies of those that were killed in
the battle, the inhabitants of Nice perceived,
that a great number of the Spanish soldiers
were circumcised; a circumstance, from
which they concluded, that a great many
Jews engage in the service of his Catholic
majesty. I am of a different opinion. The
Jews are the least of any people that I know,
addicted to a military life. I rather imagine
they were of the Moorish race, who have
subsisted in Spain, since the expulsion of their
brethren; and though they conform exter∣nally
to the rites of the Catholic religion,
still retain in private their attachment to the
law of Mahomet.</P>
<P>The city of Nice is built in form of an
irregular isosceles triangle, the base of which
fronts the sea. On the west side it is sur∣rounded
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
by a wall and rampart; on the
east, it is over-hung by a rock, on which
we see the ruins of an old castle, which, be∣fore
the invention of artillery, was counted
impregnable. It was taken and dismantled
by marechal Catinat, in the time of Victor
Amadaeus, the father of his Sardinian ma∣jesty.
It was afterwards finally demolished
by the duke of Berwick towards the latter
end of queen Anne's war. To repair it
would be a very unnecessary expence, as it
is commanded by Montalban, and several
other eminences.</P>
<P>The town of Nice is altogether indefensible,
and therefore without fortifications. There
are only two iron guns upon a bastion that
fronts the beach; and here the French had
formed a considerable battery against the
English cruisers, in the war of 1744, when
the Mareschal Duke de Belleisle had his head
quarters at Nice. This little town, situated
in the bay of Antibes, is almost equidistant
from Marseilles, Turin, and Genoa, the
first and last being about thirty leagues from
hence by sea; and the capital of Piedmont
at the same distance to the northward, over
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
the mountains. It lies exactly opposite to
Capo di Ferro, on the coast of Barbary; and
the islands of Sardinia and Corsica are laid
down about two degrees to the eastward, al∣most
exactly in a line with Genoa. This little
town, hardly a mile in circumference, is said to
contain twelve thousand inhabitants. The
streets are narrow; the houses are built of
stone, and the windows in general are fitted
with paper instead of glass. This expedient
would not answer in a country subject to rain
and storms; but here, where there is very little
of either, the paper lozenges answer tolera∣bly
well. The bourgeois, however, begin to
have their houses shashed with glass. Between
the town-wall and the sea, the fishermen
haul up their boats upon the open beach;
but on the other side of the rock, where the
castle stood, is the port or harbour of Nice,
upon which some money has been expended.
It is a small basin, defended to seaward by
a mole of free-stone, which is much better
contrived than executed: for the sea has al∣ready
made three breaches in it; and in all
probability, in another winter, the extremity
of it will be carried quite away. It would
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
require the talents of a very skilful architect
to lay the foundation of a good mole, on an
open beach like this; exposed to the swell of
the whole Mediterranean, without any island
or rock in the offing, to break the force of
the waves. Besides, the shore is bold, and
the bottom foul. There are seventeen feet of
water in the basin, sufficient to float vessels
of one hundred and fifty ton; and this is
chiefly supplied by a small stream of very fine
water; another great convenience for ship∣ping.
On the side of the mole, there is a
constant guard of soldiers, and a battery of
seven cannon, pointing to the sea. On the
other side, there is a curious manufacture
for twisting or reeling silk; a tavern, a
coffee-house, and several other buildings,
for the convenience of the sea-faring people.
Without the harbour, is a lazarette, where
persons coming from infected places, are
obliged to perform quarantine. The har∣bour
has been declared a free-port, and it is
generally full of tartanes, polacres, and other
small vessels, that come from Sardinia, Ivica,
Italy, and Spain, loaded with salt, wine,
and other commodities; but here is no trade
of any great consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225"/>
The city of Nice is provided with a senate,
which administers justice under the auspices
of an avocat-general, sent hither by the king.
The internal oeconomy of the town is ma∣naged
by four consuls; one for the noblesse,
another for the merchants, a third for the
bourgeois, and a fourth for the peasants.
These are chosen annually from the town-council.
They keep the streets and markets in
order, and superintend the public works.
There is also an intendant, who takes care
of his majesty's revenue: but there is a dis∣cretionary
power lodged in the person of the
commandant, who is always an officer of
rank in the service, and has under his imme∣diate
command the regiment which is here
in garrison. That which is here now is a
Swiss battalion, of which the king has five
or six in his service. There is likewise a re∣giment
of militia, which is exercised once a
year. But of all these particulars, I shall
speak more fully on another occasion.</P>
<P>When I stand upon the rampart, and look
round me, I can scarce help thinking myself
inchanted. The small extent of country
which I see, is all cultivated like a garden.
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
Indeed, the plain presents nothing but gar∣dens,
full of green trees, loaded with oran∣ges,
lemons, citrons, and bergamots, which
make a delightful appearance. If you exa∣mine
them more nearly, you will find plan∣tations
of green pease ready to gather; all
sorts of sallading, and pot-herbs, in perfec∣tion;
and plats of roses, carnations, ranun∣culas,
anemonies, and daffodils, blowing in
full glory, with such beauty, vigour, and
perfume, as no flower in England ever exhi∣bited.</P>
<P>I must tell you, that presents of carna∣tions
are sent from hence, in the winter, to
Turin and Paris; nay, sometimes as far as
London, by the post. They are packed up
in a wooden box, without any sort of prepa∣ration,
one pressed upon another: the per∣son
who receives them, cuts off a little bit
of the stalk, and steeps them for two hours
in vinegar and water, when they recover
their full bloom and beauty. Then he places
them in water-bottles, in an apartment where
they are screened from the severities of the
weather; and they will continue fresh and
unfaded, the best part of a month.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227"/>
Amidst the plantations in the neighbour∣hood
of Nice, appear a vast number of white
<HI>bastides,</HI> or country-houses, which make a
dazzling shew. Some few of these are good
villas, belonging to the noblesse of this coun∣ty;
and even some of the bourgeois are pro∣vided
with pretty lodgeable <HI>cassines;</HI> but in
general, they are the habitations of the pea∣sants,
and contain nothing but misery and
vermin. They are all built square; and, be∣ing
whitened with lime or plaister, contri∣bute
greatly to the richness of the view.
The hills are shaded to the tops with olive-trees,
which are always green; and those
hills are over-topped by more distant moun∣tains,
covered with snow. When I turn my∣self
towards the sea, the view is bounded by
the horizon; yet, in a clear morning, one
can perceive the high lands of Corsica. On
the right hand, it is terminated by Antibes,
and the mountain of Esterelles, which I de∣scribed
in my last. As for the weather, you
will conclude, from what I have said of the
oranges, flowers, &amp;c. that it must be won∣derfully
mild and serene: but of the cli∣mate,
I shall speak hereafter. Let me only
<PB N="226" REF="228"/>
observe, <HI>en passant,</HI> that the houses in gene∣ral
have no chimnies, but in their kitchens;
and that many people, even of condition,
at Nice, have no fire in their chambers, du∣ring
the whole winter. When the weather
happens to be a little more sharp than usual,
they warm their apartments with a <HI>brasiere</HI>
of charcoal.</P>
<P>Though Nice itself retains few marks of
antient splendor, there are considerable mo∣numents
of antiquity in its neighbourhood.
About two short miles from the town, upon
the summit of a pretty high hill, we find
the ruins of the antient city Cemenelion,
now called Cimia, which was once the me∣tropolis
of the Maritime Alps, and the seat
of a Roman president. With respect to situ∣ation,
nothing could be more agreeable or
salubrious. It stood upon the gentle ascent
and summit of a hill, fronting the Mediter∣ranean;
from the shore of which, it is dis∣tant
about half a league; and, on the other
side, it overlooked a bottom, or narrow vale,
through which the Paglion (antiently called
Paulo) runs towards the walls of Nice. It
was inhabited by a people, whom Ptolomy
<PB N="227" REF="229"/>
an d Pliny call the <HI>Vedantij:</HI> but these were
undoubtedly mixed with a Roman colony,
as appears by the monuments which still re∣main;
I mean the ruins of an amphitheatre,
a temple of Apollo, baths, aqueducts, se∣pulchral,
and other stones, with inscrip∣tions,
and a great number of medals, which
the peasants have found by accident, in dig∣ging
and labouring the vineyards and corn∣fields,
which now cover the ground where
the city stood. Touching this city, very
little is to be learned from the antient histo∣rians:
but that it was the seat of a Roman
praeses, is proved by the two following in∣scriptions,
which are still extant.</P>

<P>I shall give you one more sepulchral in∣scription
on a marble, which is now placed
over the gate of the church belonging to the
convent of St. Pont, a venerable building,
which stands at the bottom of the hill, front∣ing
the north side of the town of Nice. This
<PB N="229" REF="231"/>
St. Pont, or Pontius, was a Roman convert
to Christianity, who suffered martyrdom at
Cemenelion in the year 261, during the
reigns of the emperors Valerian and Galli∣enus.
The legends recount some ridiculous
miracles wrought in favour of this saint,
both before and after his death. Charles V.
emperor of Germany and king of Spain,
caused this monastery to be built on the spot
where Pontius suffered decapitation. But to
return to the inscription: it appears in these

<P>The amphitheatre of Cemenelion is but
very small, compared to that of Nismes. The
arena is ploughed up, and bears corn: some
of the seats remain, and part of two oppo∣site
porticos; but all the columns, and the
external façade of the building, are taken
<PB N="230" REF="232"/>
away; so that it is impossible to judge of
the architecture: all that we can perceive
is, that it was built in an oval form. About
one hundred paces from the amphitheatre
stood an antient temple, supposed to have
been dedicated to Apollo. The original roof
is demolished, as well as the portico; the
vestiges of which may still be traced. The
part called the Basilica, and about one half
of the Cella Sanctior, remain, and are con∣verted
into the dwelling-house and stable of
the peasant who takes care of the count de
Gubernatis's garden, in which this monu∣ment
stands. In the Cella Sanctior, I found
a lean cow, a he-goat, and a jack-ass; the
very same conjunction of animals which I
had seen drawing a plough in Burgundy.
Several mutilated statues have been dug up
from the ruins of this temple; and a great
number of medals have been found in the
different vineyards which now occupy the
space upon which stood the antient city of
Cemenelion. These were of gold, silver,
and brass. Many of them were presented
to Charles Emanuel I. duke of Savoy. The
prince of Monaco has a good number of
<PB N="231" REF="233"/>
them in his collection; and the rest are in
private hands. The peasants, in digging,
have likewise found many urns, lachrymato∣ries,
and sepulchral stones, with epitaphs,
which are now dispersed among different
convents and private houses. All this ground
is a rich mine of antiquities, which, if pro∣perly
worked, would produce a great num∣ber
of valuable curiosities. Just by the tem∣ple
of Apollo were the ruins of a bath,
composed of great blocks of marble, which
have been taken away for the purposes of
modern building. In all probability, many
other noble monuments of this city have
been dilapidated by the same barbarous oeco∣nomy.
There are some subterranean vaults,
through which the water was conducted to
this bath, still extant in the garden of the
count de Gubernatis. Of the aqueduct that
conveyed water to the town, I can say very
little, but that it was scooped through a
mountain: that this subterranean passage was
discovered some years ago, by removing the
rubbish which choaked it up: that the peo∣ple
penetrating a considerable way, by the
help of lighted torches, found a very plenti∣ful
<PB N="232" REF="234"/>
stream of water flowing in an aqueduct,
as high as an ordinary man, arched over
head, and lined with a sort of cement. They
could not, however, trace this stream to its
source; and it is again stopped up with earth
and rubbish. There is not a soul in this
country, who has either spirit or understand∣ing
to conduct an inquiry of this kind.
Hard by the amphitheatre is a convent of
Recollects, built in a very romantic situation,
on the brink of a precipice. On one side of
their garden, they ascend to a kind of espla∣nade,
which they say was part of the citadel
of Cemenelion. They have planted it with
cypress-trees, and flowering-shrubs. One of
the monks told me, that it is vaulted below,
as they can plainly perceive by the sound of
their instruments used in houghing the
ground. A very small expence would bring
the secrets of this cavern to light. They
have nothing to do, but to make a breach
in the wall, which appears uncovered to∣wards
the garden.</P>
<P>The city of Cemenelion was first sacked
by the Longobards, who made an irruption
into Provence, under their king Alboinus,
<PB N="233" REF="235"/>
about the middle of the sixth century. It
was afterwards totally destroyed by the Sara∣cens,
who, at different times, ravaged this
whole coast. The remains of the people are
supposed to have changed their habitation,
and formed a coalition with the inhabitants
of Nice.</P>
<P>What further I have to say of Nice, you
shall know in good time; at present, I have
nothing to add, but what you very well
know, that I am always your affectionate
humble servant.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 20, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST Sunday I crossed Montalban on
horseback, with some Swiss officers, on
a visit to our consul, Mr. B—d, who
lives at Ville Franche, about half a league
from Nice. It is a small town, built upon
the side of a rock, at the bottom of the
harbour, which is a fine basin, surrounded
with hills on every side, except to the south,
where it lies open to the sea. If there was a
small island in the mouth of it, to break off
the force of the waves, when the wind is
southerly, it would be one of the finest har∣bours
in the world; for the ground is ex∣ceeding
good for anchorage: there is a suffi∣cient
depth of water, and room enough for
the whole navy of England. On the right
hand, as you enter the port, there is an ele∣gant
fanal, or light-house, kept in good re∣pair:
but in all the charts of this coast which
<PB N="235" REF="237"/>
I have seen, this lanthorn is laid down to the
westward of the harbour; an error equally
absurd and dangerous, as it may mislead the
navigator, and induce him to run his ship
among the rocks, to the eastward of the
light-house, where it would undoubtedly pe∣rish.
Opposite to the mouth of the harbour
is the fort, which can be of no service, but
in defending the shipping and the town by
sea; for, by land, it is commanded by
Montalban, and all the hills in the neigh∣bourhood.
In the war of 1744, it was taken
and re-taken. At present, it is in tolerable
good repair. On the left of the fort, is the
basin for the gallies, with a kind of dock, in
which they are built, and occasionally laid
up to be refitted. This basin is formed by a
pretty stone mole; and here his Sardinian
majesty's two gallies lie perfectly secure,
moored with their sterns close to the jetté. I
went on board one of these vessels, and saw
about two hundred miserable wretches, chain∣ed
to the banks on which they sit and row,
when the galley is at sea. This is a sight
which a British subject, sensible of the bles∣sing
he enjoys, cannot behold without hor∣ror
<PB N="236" REF="238"/>
and compassion. Not but that if we con∣sider
the nature of the case, with coolness
and deliberation, we must acknowledge the
justice, and even sagacity, of employing for
the service of the public, those malefactors
who have forfeited their title to the privi∣leges
of the community. Among the slaves
at Ville Franche is a Piedmontese count,
condemned to the gallies for life, in conse∣quence
of having been convicted of forgery.</P>
<P>He is permitted to live on shore; and gets
money by employing the other slaves to knit
stockings for sale. He appears always in the
Turkish habit, and is in a fair way of rai∣sing
a better fortune than that which he has
forfeited. It is a great pity, however, and a
manifest outrage against the law of nations,
as well as of humanity, to mix with those
banditti, the Moorish and Turkish prisoners
who are taken in the prosecution of open
war. It is certainly no justification of this
barbarous practice, that the Christian priso∣ners
are treated as cruelly at Tunis and Al∣giers.
It would be for the honour of Chris∣tendom,
to set an example of generosity to
the Turks; and, if they would not follow
<PB N="237" REF="239"/>
it, to join their naval forces, and extirpate
at once those nests of pirates, who have so
long infested the Mediterranean. Certainly,
nothing can be more shameful, than the
treaties which France and the Maritime
Powers have concluded with those barbarians.
They supply them with artillery, arms, and
ammunition, to disturb their neighbours.
They even pay them a sort of tribute, under
the denomination of presents; and often put
up with insults tamely, for the sordid conside∣ration
of a little gain in the way of commerce.
They know that Spain, Sardinia, and almost
all the Catholic powers in the Mediterranean,
Adriatic, and Levant, are at perpetual war
with those Mahometans; that while Algiers,
Tunis, and Sallee, maintain armed cruisers
at sea, those Christian powers will not run
the risque of trading in their own bottoms,
but rather employ as carriers the maritime
nations, who are at peace with the infidels.
It is for our share of this advantage, that we
cultivate the piratical States of Barbary, and
meanly purchase passports of them, thus ac∣knowledging
them masters of the Mediterra∣nean.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240"/>
The Sardinian gallies are mounted each
with five-and-twenty oars, and six guns, six-pounders,
of a side, and a large piece of ar∣tillery
a midships, pointing a-head, which
(so far as I am able to judge) can never be
used point-blank, without demolishing the
head or prow of the galley. The accommo∣dation
on board for the officers is wretched.
There is a paltry cabin in the poop for the
commander; but all the other officers lie be∣low
the slaves, in a dungeon, where they
have neither light, air, nor any degree of
quiet; half suffocated by the heat of the
place; tormented by fleas, bugs, and lice;
and disturbed by the incessant noise over
head. The slaves lie upon the naked banks,
without any other covering than a tilt. This,
however, is no great hardship, in a climate
where there is a scarce any winter. They are
fed with a very scanty allowance of bread,
and about fourteen beans a day; and twice
a week they have a little rice, or cheese: but
most of them, while they are in harbour,
knit stockings, or do some other kind of
work, which enables them to make some ad∣dition
to this wretched allowance. When
<PB N="239" REF="241"/>
they happen to be at sea in bad weather,
their situation is truly deplorable. Every
wave breaks over the vessel, and not only
keeps them continually wet, but comes with
such force, that they are dashed against the
banks with surprising violence: sometimes
their limbs are broke, and sometimes their
brains dashed out. It is impossible (they say)
to keep such a number of desperate people
under any regular command, without exer∣cising
such severities as must shock humanity.
It is almost equally impossible to maintain
any tolerable degree of cleanliness, where
such a number of wretches are crouded to∣gether
without conveniences, or even the ne∣cessaries
of life. They are ordered twice a
week to strip, clean, and bathe themselves in
the sea: but, notwithstanding all the precau∣tions
of discipline, they swarm with vermin,
and the vessel smells like an hospital, or
crouded jail. They seem, nevertheless, quite
insensible of their misery, like so many con∣victs
in Newgate: they laugh and sing, and
swear, and get drunk when they can. When
you enter by the stern, you are welcomed by
a band of musick selected from the slaves;
<PB N="240" REF="242"/>
and these expect a gratification. If you walk
forwards, you must take care of your pock∣ets.
You will be accosted by one or other of
the slaves, with a brush and blacking-ball for
cleaning your shoes; and if you undergo
this operation, it is ten to one but your pocket
is picked. If you decline his service, and
keep aloof, you will find it almost impossible
to avoid a colony of vermin, which these fel∣lows
have a very dextrous method of convey∣ing
to strangers. Some of the Turkish pri∣soners,
whose ransom or exchange is expected,
are allowed to go ashore, under proper in∣spection;
and those <HI>forçats,</HI> who have served
the best part of the time for which they were
condemned, are employed in public works,
under a guard of soldiers. At the harbour
of Nice, they are hired by ship-masters to
bring ballast, and have a small proportion of
what they earn, for their own use: the rest
belongs to the king. They are distinguished
by an iron shackle about one of their legs.
The road from Nice to Ville Franche is
scarce passable on horseback: a circumstance
the more extraordinary, as those slaves, in
the space of two or three months, might
<PB N="241" REF="243"/>
even make it fit for a carriage, and the king
would not be one farthing out of pocket,
for they are quite idle the greatest part of
the year.</P>
<P>The gallies go to sea only in the summer.
In tempestuous weather, they could not live
out of port. Indeed, they are good for no∣thing
but in smooth water, during a calm;
when, by dint of rowing, they make good
way. The king of Sardinia is so sensible of
their inutility, that he intends to let his gal∣lies
rot; and, in lieu of them, has purchased
two large frigates in England, one of fifty,
and another of thirty guns, which are now
in the harbour of Ville Franche. He has
also procured an English officer, one Mr.
A—, who is second in command on
board of one of them, and has the title of
captain <HI>consulteur,</HI> that is, instructor to the
first captain, the marquis de M—i, who
knows as little of seamanship as I do of
Arabic.</P>
<P>The king, it is said, intends to have two
or three more frigates, and then he will be
more than a match for the Barbary corsairs,
provided care be taken to man his fleet in a
<PB N="242" REF="244"/>
proper manner: but this will never be done,
unless he invites foreigners into his service,
officers as well as seamen; for his own do∣minions
produce neither at present. If he is
really determined to make the most of the
maritime situation of his dominions, as well
as of his alliance with Great-Britain, he
ought to supply his ships with English mari∣ners,
and put a British commander at the
head of his fleet. He ought to erect maga∣zines
and docks at Villa Franca; or if there
is not conveniency for building, he may at
least have pits and wharfs for heaving down
and careening; and these ought to be under
the direction of Englishmen, who best un∣derstand
all the particulars of marine oeco∣nomy.
Without all doubt, he will not be
able to engage foreigners, without giving
them liberal appointments; and their being
engaged in his service will give umbrage to
his own subjects: but, when the business is
to establish a maritime power, these conside∣rations
ought to be sacrificed to reasons of
public utility. Nothing can be more absurd
and unreasonable, than the murmurs of the
Piedmontese officers at the preferment of fo∣reigners,
<PB N="243" REF="245"/>
who execute those things for the
advantage of their country, of which they
know themselves incapable. When Mr.
P—n was first promoted in the service of
his Sardinian majesty, he met with great op∣position,
and numberless mortifications, from
the jealousy of the Piedmontese officers, and
was obliged to hazard his life in many ren∣counters
with them, before they would be
quiet. Being a man of uncommon spirit,
he never suffered the least insult or affront to
pass unchastised. He had repeated opportu∣nities
of signalizing his valour against the
Turks; and by dint of extraordinary merit,
and long services, not only attained the chief
command of the gallies, with the rank of
lieutenant-general, but also acquired a very
considerable share of the king's favour, and
was appointed commandant of Nice. His
Sardinian majesty found his account more
ways than one, in thus promoting Mr.
P—n. He made the acquisition of an ex∣cellent
officer, of tried courage and fidelity,
by whose advice he conducted his marine af∣fairs.
This gentleman was perfectly well
esteemed at the court of London. In the
<PB N="244" REF="246"/>
war of 1744, he lived in the utmost harmo∣ny
with the British admirals who commanded
our fleet in the Mediterranean. In conse∣quence
of this good understanding, a thou∣sand
occasional services were performed by
the English ships, for the benefit of his mas∣ter,
which otherwise could not have been
done, without a formal application to our
ministry; in which case, the opportunities
would have been lost. I know our admirals
had general orders and instructions, to co∣operate
in all things with his Sardinian ma∣jesty;
but I know, also, by experience, how
little these general instructions avail, when
the admiral is not cordially interested in the
service. Were the king of Sardinia at pre∣sent
engaged with England in a new war
against France, and a British squadron sta∣tioned
upon this coast, as formerly, he would
find a great difference in this particular. He
should therefore carefully avoid having at
Nice a Savoyard commandant, utterly igno∣rant
of sea affairs; unacquainted with the
true interest of his master; proud, and ar∣bitrary;
reserved to strangers, from a pre∣judice
of national jealousy; and particularly
averse to the English.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247"/>
With respect to the antient name of Villa
Franca, there is a dispute among antiquarians.
It is not at all mentioned in the <HI>Itinerarium</HI> of
Antoninus, unless it is meant as the port of
Nice. But it is more surprising, that the ac∣curate
Strabo, in describing this coast, men∣tions
no such harbour. Some people ima∣gine
it is the Portus Herculis Monaeci. But
this is undoubtedly what is now called Mona∣co;
the harbour of which exactly tallies with
what Strabo says of the Portus Monaeci—
<HI>neque magnas, neque multas capit naves.</HI> Pto∣lomy,
indeed, seems to mention it under the
name of Herculis Portus, different from the
Portus Monaeci. His words are these: <HI>post
vari ostium ad Ligustrium mare, massiliensium
sunt</HI> Nicaea, <HI>Herculis Portus, Trophaea Augusti,
Monaeci Portus.</HI> In that case, Hercules was
worshipped both here and at Monaco, and
gave his name to both places. But on this
subject, I shall perhaps speak more fully in
another letter, after I have seen the <HI>Trophaea
Augusti,</HI> now called Tourbia, and the town
of Monaco, which last is about three leagues
from Nice. Here I cannot help taking notice
of the following elegant description from the
<PB N="246" REF="248"/>
Pharsalia, which seems to have been in∣tended
for this very harbour.</P>
<Q><L>Finis et Hesperiae promoto milite varus,</L>
<L>Quaque sub Herculeo sacratus numine Portus</L>
<L>Urget rupe cava Pelagus, non <HI>Corus</HI> in illum</L>
<L>Jus habet, aut <HI>Zephirus,</HI> solus sua littora turbat</L>
<L><HI>Circius,</HI> et tuta prohibet statione Monaeci.</L></Q>
<P>The present town of Villa Franca was
built and settled in the thirteenth century,
by order of Charles II. king of the Sicilies,
and count of Provence, in order to defend
the harbour from the descents of the Sara∣cens,
who at that time infested the coast.
The inhabitants were removed hither from
another town, situated on the top of a
mountain in the neighbourhood, which those
pirates had destroyed. Some ruins of the
old town are still extant. In order to se∣cure
the harbour still more effectually, Ema∣nuel
Philibert, duke of Savoy, built the fort
in the beginning of the last century, toge∣ther
with the mole where the gallies are
moored. As I said before, Ville Franche is
<PB N="247" REF="249"/>
built on the face of a barren rock, washed
by the sea; and there is not an acre of plain
ground within a mile of it. In summer, the
reflexion of the sun from the rocks must
make it intolerably hot; for even at this
time of the year, I walked myself into a pro∣fuse
sweat, by going about a quarter of a
mile to see the gallies.</P>
<P>Pray remember me to our friends at
A—'s, and believe me to be ever yours.</P>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your favour which I received by Mr.
M—1, you remind me of my promise,
to communicate the remarks I have still to
make on the French nation; and at the same
time you signify your opinion, that I am too
severe in my former observations. You even
hint a suspicion, that this severity is owing
<PB N="248" REF="250"/>
to some personal cause of resentment; but,
I protest, I have no particular cause of
animosity against any individual of that
country. I have neither obligation to, nor
quarrel with, any subject of France; and
when I meet with a Frenchman worthy of
my esteem, I can receive him into my friend∣ship
with as much cordiality, as I could feel
for any fellow citizen of the same merit. I
even respect the nation, for the number of
great men it has produced in all arts and
sciences. I respect the French officers, in
particular, for their gallantry and valour;
and especially for that generous humanity
which they exercise towards their enemies,
even amidst the horrors of war. This libe∣ral
spirit is the only circumstance of antient
chivalry, which I think was worth preserving.
It had formerly flourished in England, but
was almost extinguished in a succession of
civil wars, which are always productive of
cruelty and rancour. It was Henry IV. of
France, (a real knight errant) who revived
it in Europe. He possessed that greatness of
mind, which can forgive injuries of the
deepest dye: and as he had also the faculty
<PB N="249" REF="251"/>
of distinguishing characters, he found his
account, in favouring with his friendship and
confidence, some of those who had opposed
him in the field with the most inveterate per∣severance.
I know not whether he did more
service to mankind in general, by reviving
the practice of treating his prisoners with ge∣nerosity,
than he prejudiced his own country
by patronizing the absurd and pernicious
custom of duelling, and establishing a <HI>punto,</HI>
founded in diametrical opposition to common
sense and humanity.</P>
<P>I have often heard it observed, that a
French officer is generally an agreeable com∣panion
when he is turned of fifty. Without
all doubt, by that time, the fire of his viva∣city,
which makes him so troublesome in his
youth, will be considerably abated, and in
other respects, he must be improved by his
experience. But there is a fundamental error
in the first principles of his education, which
time rather confirms than removes. Early
prejudices are for the most part converted into
habits of thinking; and accordingly you will
find the old officers in the French service
<PB N="250" REF="252"/>
more bigotted than their juniors, to the
punctilios of false honour.</P>
<P>A lad of a good family no sooner enters
into the service, than he thinks it incumbent
upon him to shew his courage in a rencon∣tre.
His natural vivacity prompts him to
hazard in company every thing that comes
uppermost, without any respect to his se∣niors
or betters; and ten to one but he says
something, which he finds it necessary to
maintain with his sword. The old officer,
instead of checking his petulance, either by
rebuke or silent disapprobation, seems to be
pleased with his impertinence, and encou∣rages
every sally of his presumption. Should
a quarrel ensue, and the parties go out, he
makes no efforts to compromise the dispute;
but sits with a pleasing expectation to learn
the issue of the rencontre. If the young
man is wounded, he kisses him with trans∣port,
extols his bravery, puts him into the
hands of the surgeon, and visits him with
great tenderness every day, until he is cured.
If he is killed on the spot, he shrugs up his
shoulders—says, <HI>quelle dommage! c'étoit un
aimable enfant! ah, patience!</HI> and in three
<PB N="251" REF="253"/>
hours the defunct is forgotten. You know,
in France, duels are forbid, on pain of
death: but this law is easily evaded. The
person insulted walks out; the antagonist un∣derstands
the hint, and follows him into the
street, where they justle as if by accident,
draw their swords, and one of them is either
killed or disabled, before any effectual means
can be used to part them. Whatever may
be the issue of the combat, the magistrate
takes no cognizance of it; at least, it is in∣terpreted
into an accidental rencounter, and
no penalty is incurred on either side. Thus
the purpose of the law is entirely defeated,
by a most ridiculous and cruel connivance.
The meerest trifles in conversation, a rash
word, a distant hint, even a look or smile of
contempt, is sufficient to produce one of
these combats; but injuries of a deeper dye,
such as terms of reproach, the lie direct, a
blow, or even the menace of a blow, must
be discussed with more formality. In any of
these cases, the parties agree to meet in the
dominions of another prince, where they
can murder each other, without fear of pu∣nishment.
An officer who is struck, or even
<PB N="252" REF="254"/>
threatened with a blow, must not be quiet,
until he either kills his antagonist, or loses
his own life. A friend of mine, (a Nissard)
who was in the service of France, told me,
that some years ago, one of their captains,
in the heat of passion, struck his lieutenant.
They fought immediately: the lieutenant
was wounded and disarmed. As it was an
affront that could not be made up, he no
sooner recovered of his wounds, than he
called out the captain a second time. In a
word, they fought five times before the com∣bat
proved decisive; at last, the lieutenant
was left dead on the spot. This was an
event which sufficiently proved the absurdity
of the punctilio that gave rise to it. The
poor gentleman who was insulted, and out∣raged
by the brutality of the aggressor, found
himself under the necessity of giving him a
further occasion to take away his life. Ano∣ther
adventure of the same kind happened
a few years ago in this place. A French
officer having threatened to strike another, a
formal challenge ensued; and it being agreed
that they should fight until one of them
dropped, each provided himself with a cou∣ple
<PB N="253" REF="255"/>
of pioneers to dig his grave on the spot.
They engaged just without one of the gates
of Nice, in presence of a great number of
spectators, and fought with surprising fury,
until the ground was drenched with their
blood. At length one of them stumbled, and
fell; upon which the other, who found him∣self
mortally wounded, advancing, and drop∣ping
his point, said, “<HI>Je te donne ce que tu
m'as oté.</HI>” “I give thee that which thou
hast taken from me.” So saying, he dropped
dead upon the field. The other, who had
been the person insulted, was so dangerously
wounded, that he could not rise. Some of
the spectators carried him forthwith to the
beach, and putting him into a boat, con∣veyed
him by sea to Antibes. The body of
his antagonist was denied Christian burial,
as he died without absolution, and every
body allowed that his soul went to hell: but
the gentlemen of the army declared, that he
died like a man of honour. Should a man
be never so well inclined to make atonement
in a peaceable manner, for an insult given in
the heat of passion, or in the fury of intoxi∣cation,
it cannot be received. Even an in∣voluntary
<PB N="254" REF="256"/>
trespass from ignorance, or ab∣sence
of mind, must be cleansed with blood.
A certain noble lord, of our country, when
he was yet a commoner, on his travels, in∣volved
himself in a dilemma of this sort, at
the court of Lorrain. He had been riding
out, and strolling along a public walk, in a
brown study, with his horse-whip in his
hand, perceived a caterpillar crawling on the
back of a marquis, who chanced to be be∣fore
him. He never thought of the <HI>petit
maitre;</HI> but lifting up his whip, in order to
kill the insect, laid it across his shoulders
with a crack, that alarmed all the company
in the walk. The marquis's sword was pro∣duced
in a moment, and the aggressor in
great hazard of his life, as he had no wea∣pon
of defence. He was no sooner waked
from his reverie, than he begged pardon,
and offered to make all proper concessions
for what he had done through mere inad∣vertency.
The marquis would have admitted
his excuses, had there been any precedent of
such an affront washed away without blood.
A conclave of honour was immediately as∣sembled;
and after long disputes, they agreed,
<PB N="255" REF="257"/>
that an involuntary offence, especially from
<HI>such a kind of man, d'un tel homme,</HI> might be
attoned by concessions. That you may have
some idea of the small beginning, from
which many gigantic quarrels arise, I shall
recount one that lately happened at Lyons,
as I had it from the mouth of a person who
was an ear and eye-witness of the transaction.
Two Frenchmen, at a public ordinary,
stunned the rest of the company with their
loquacity. At length one of them, with a
supercilious air, asked the other's name. “I
never tell my name, (said he) but in a whis∣per.”
“You may have very good reasons
for keeping it secret,” replied the first. “I
will tell you,” (resumed the other): with
these words, he rose; and going round to
him, pronounced, loud enough to be heard
by the whole company, “<HI>Je m'appelle Pierre
Paysan; et vous etes un impertinent.</HI>” So say∣ing,
he walked out: the interrogator fol∣lowed
him into the street, where they justled,
drew their swords, and engaged. He who
asked the question was run through the
body; but his relations were so powerful,
that the victor was obliged to fly his country.
<PB N="256" REF="258"/>
He was tried and condemned in his absence;
his goods were confiscated; his wife broke
her heart; his children were reduced to beg∣gary;
and he himself is now starving in ex∣ile.
In England, we have not yet adopted
all the implacability of the punctilio. A gen∣tleman
may be insulted even with a blow,
and survive, after having once hazarded his
life against the aggressor. The laws of ho∣nour
in our country do not oblige him ei∣ther
to slay the person from whom he re∣ceived
the injury, or even to fight to the last
drop of his own blood. One finds no exam∣ples
of duels among the Romans, who were
certainly as brave and as delicate in their no∣tions
of honour, as the French. Cornelius
Nepos tells us, that a famous Athenian ge∣neral,
having a dispute with his colleague,
who was of Sparta, a man of a fiery dispo∣sition,
this last lifted up his cane to strike
him. Had this happened to a French <HI>petit
maitre,</HI> death must have ensued: but mark
what followed.—The Athenian, far from
resenting the outrage, in what is now called
a gentleman-like manner, said, “do, strike
if you please; but hear me.” He never
<PB N="257" REF="259"/>
dreamed of cutting the Lacedemonian's throat;
but bore with his passionate temper, as the
infirmity of a friend who had a thousand
good qualities to overbalance that defect.</P>
<P>I need not expatiate upon the folly and the
mischief which are countenanced and pro∣moted
by the modern practice of duelling.
I need not give examples of friends who have
murdered each other, in obedience to this sa∣vage
custom, even while their hearts were melt∣ing
with mutual tenderness; nor will I par∣ticularize
the instances which I myself know,
of whole families ruined, of women and chil∣dren
made widows and orphans, of parents de∣prived
of only sons, and of valuable lives lost to
the community, by duels, which had been pro∣duced
by one unguarded expression, uttered
without intention of offence, in the heat of
dispute and altercation. I shall not insist upon
the hardship of a worthy man's being oblig∣ed
to devote himself to death, because it is his
misfortune to be insulted by a brute, a bully,
a drunkard, or a madman: neither will I
enlarge upon this side of the absurdity, which
indeed amounts to a contradiction in terms;
I mean the dilemma to which a gentleman
<PB N="258" REF="260"/>
in the army is reduced, when he receives an
affront: if he does not challenge and fight his
antagonist, he is broke with infamy by a
court-martial; if he fights and kills him, he
is tried by the civil power, convicted of mur∣der,
and, if the royal mercy does not inter∣pose,
he is infallibly hanged: all this, ex∣clusive
of the risque of his own life in the
duel, and his conscience being burthened
with the blood of a man, whom perhaps he
has sacrificed to a false punctilio, even con∣trary
to his own judgment. These are reflec∣tions
which I know your own good sense
will suggest, but I will make bold to propose
a remedy for this gigantic evil, which seems
to gain ground every day: let a court be in∣stituted
for taking cognizance of all breaches
of honour, with power to punish by fine,
pillory, sentence of infamy, outlawry, and
exile, by virtue of an act of parliament made
for this purpose; and all persons insulted,
shall have recourse to this tribunal: let every
man who seeks personal reparation with
sword, pistol, or other instrument of death,
be declared infamous, and banished the king∣dom:
let every man, convicted of having used
<PB N="259" REF="261"/>
a sword or pistol, or other mortal weapon,
against another, either in duel or rencountre,
occasioned by any previous quarrel, be subject
to the same penalties: if any man is killed
in a duel, let his body be hanged upon a
public gibbet, for a certain time, and then
given to the surgeons: let his antagonist be
hanged as a murderer, and dissected also;
and some mark of infamy be set on the me∣mory
of both. I apprehend such regulations
would put an effectual stop to the practice of
duelling, which nothing but the fear of in∣famy
can support; for I am persuaded, that
no being, capable of reflection, would pro∣secute
the trade of assassination at the risque
of his own life, if this hazard was at the
same time reinforced by the certain prospect
of infamy and ruin. Every person of senti∣ment
would in that case allow, that an offi∣cer,
who in a duel robs a deserving woman
of her husband, a number of children of their
father, a family of its support, and the com∣munity
of a fellow citizen, has as little me∣rit
to plead from exposing his own person,
as a highwayman, or housebreaker, who every
day risques his life to rob or plunder that
<PB N="260" REF="262"/>
which is not of half the importance to society.
I think it was from the Buccaneers of Ame∣rica,
that the English have learned to abolish
one solecism in the practice of duelling: those
adventurers decided their personal quarrels
with pistols; and this improvement has been
adopted in Great Britain with good success;
though in France, and other parts of the con∣tinent,
it is looked upon as a proof of their
barbarity. It is, however, the only circum∣stance
of duelling, which savours of common
sense, as it puts all mankind upon a level,
the old with the young, the weak with the
strong, the unwieldy with the nimble, and
the man who knows not how to hold a sword
with the <HI>spadassin,</HI> who has practised fenc∣ing
from the cradle. What glory is there
in a man's vanquishing an adversary over
whom he has a manifest advantage? To
abide the issue of a combat in this case, does
not even require that moderate share of reso∣lution
which nature has indulged to her com∣mon
children. Accordingly, we have seen
many instances of a coward's provoking a
man of honour to battle. In the reign of
our second Charles, when duels flourished in
<PB N="261" REF="263"/>
all their absurdity, and the seconds fought
while their principals were engaged, Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham, not content with hav∣ing
debauched the countess of Shrewsbury,
and publishing her shame, took all opportu∣nities
of provoking the earl to single combat,
hoping he should have an easy conquest, his
lordship being a puny little creature, quiet,
inoffensive, and every way unfit for such per∣sonal
contests. He ridiculed him on all oc∣casions;
and at last declared in public com∣pany,
that there was no glory in cuckolding
Shrewsbury, who had not spirit to resent the
injury. This was an insult which could not
be overlooked. The earl sent him a chal∣lenge;
and they agreed to fight, at Barns-Elms,
in presence of two gentlemen, whom
they chose for their seconds. All the four
engaged at the same time: the first thrust
was fatal to the earl of Shrewsbury; and his
friend killed the duke's second at the same
instant. Buckingham, elated with his ex∣ploit,
set out immediately for the earl's seat
at Cliefden, where he lay with his wife, after
having boasted of the murder of her husband,
whose blood he shewed her upon his sword,
<PB N="262" REF="264"/>
as a trophy of his prowess. But this very
duke of Buckingham was little better than
a poltroon at bottom. When the gallant earl
of Ossory challenged him to fight in Chelsea
fields, he crossed the water to Battersea, where
he pretended to wait for his lordship; and
then complained to the house of lords, that
Ossory had given him the rendezvous, and
did not keep his appointment. He knew the
house would interpose in the quarrel, and he
was not disappointed. Their lordships obliged
them both to give their word of honour, that
their quarrel should have no other conse∣quences.</P>
<P>I ought to make an apology for having
troubled a lady with so many observations
on a subject so unsuitable to the softness of
the fair sex; but I know you cannot be in∣different
to any thing that so nearly affects
the interests of humanity, which I can safely
aver have alone suggested every thing which

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>May 2, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Few days ago, I rode out with two gen∣tlemen
of this country, to see a stream
of water which was formerly conveyed in an
aqueduct to the antient city of Cemenelion,
from whence this place is distant about a
mile, though separated by abrupt rocks and
deep hollows, which last are here honoured
with the name of vallies. The water, which
is exquisitely cool, and light and pure, gushes
from the middle of a rock by a hole which
leads to a subterranean aqueduct carried
through the middle of the mountain. This
is a Roman work, and the more I considered
it, appeared the more stupendous. A pea∣sant
who lives upon the spot told us, he had
entered by this hole at eight in the morning,
and advanced so far, that it was four in the
afternoon before he came out. He said he
walked in the water, through a regular ca∣nal
<PB N="264" REF="266"/>
formed of a hard stone, lined with a kind
of cement, and vaulted over-head; but so
high in most parts he could stand upright,
yet in others, the bed of the canal was so
filled with earth and stones, that he was
obliged to stoop in passing. He said that
there were air-holes at certain distances (and
indeed I saw one of these not far from the
present issue) that there were some openings
and stone seats on the sides, and here and
there figures of men formed of stone, with
hammers and working tools in their hands.
I am apt to believe the fellow romanced a lit∣tle,
in order to render his adventure the more
marvellous: but I am certainly informed, that
several persons have entered this passage, and
proceeded a considerable way by the light of
torches, without arriving at the source, which
(if we may believe the tradition of the coun∣try)
is at the distance of eight leagues from
this opening; but this is altogether incredi∣ble.
The stream is now called <HI>la fontaine de
muraille,</HI> and is carefully conducted by diffe∣rent
branches into the adjacent vineyards and
gardens, for watering the ground. On the
side of the same mountain, more southerly,
<PB N="265" REF="267"/>
at the distance of half a mile, there is ano∣ther
still more copious discharge of the same
kind of water, called <HI>la source du temple.</HI> It
was conveyed through the same kind of pas∣sage,
and put to the same use as the other;
and I should imagine they are both from the
same source, which, though hitherto undis∣covered,
must be at a considerable distance,
as the mountain is continued for several
leagues to the westward, without exhibiting
the least signs of water in any other part.
But, exclusive of the subterranean conduits,
both these streams must have been conveyed
through aqueducts extending from hence to
Cemenelion over steep rocks and deep ravines,
at a prodigious expence. The water from
this <HI>source du temple,</HI> issues from a stone build∣ing
which covers the passage in the rock. It
serves to turn several olive, corn, and paper
mills, being conveyed through a modern
aqueduct raised upon a paultry arcade at
the expence of the public, and afterwards is
branched off in very small streams, for the be∣nefit
of this parched and barren country.
The Romans were so used to bathing, that
they could not exist without a great quan∣tity
<PB N="266" REF="268"/>
of water; and this, I imagine, is one
reason that induced them to spare no labour
and expence in bringing it from a distance,
when they had not plenty of it at home.
But, besides this motive, they had ano∣ther:
they were so nice and delicate in their
taste of water, that they took great pains to
supply themselves with the purest and lightest
from afar, for drinking and culinary uses,
even while they had plenty of an inferior sort
for their baths, and other domestic purposes.
There are springs of good water on the spot
where Cemenelion stood: but there is a hard∣ness
in all well-water, which quality is de∣posited
in running a long course, especially
if exposed to the influence of the sun and
air. The Romans, therefore, had good rea∣son
to soften and meliorate this element, by
conveying it a good length of way in open
aqueducts. What was used in the baths of
Cemenelion, they probably brought in leaden
pipes, some of which have been dug up very
lately by accident. You must know, I made
a second excursion to these antient ruins, and
measured the arena of the amphitheatre with
pack thread. It is an oval figure; the longest
<PB N="267" REF="269"/>
diameter extending to about one hundred and
thirteen feet, and the shortest to eighty-eight;
but I will not answer for the exactness of the
measurement. In the center of it, there was
a square stone, with an iron ring, to which
I suppose the wild beasts were tied, to pre∣vent
their springing upon the spectators. Some
of the seats remain, with two opposite en∣trances,
consisting each of one large gate,
and two lateral smaller doors, arched: there
is also a considerable portion of the external
wall; but no columns, or other ornaments
of architecture. Hard by, in the garden of
the count de Gubernatis, I saw the remains
of a bath, fronting the portal of the temple,
which I have described in a former letter;
and here were some shafts of marble pillars,
particularly a capital of the Corinthian order,
beautifully cut, of white alabaster. Here the
count found a large quantity of fine marble,
which he has converted to various uses; and
some mutilated statues, bronze as well as
marble. The peasant shewed me some brass
and silver medals, which he has picked up at
different times in labouring the ground; to∣gether
with several oblong beads of coloured
<PB N="268" REF="270"/>
glass, which were used as ear-rings by the
Roman ladies; and a small seal of agate,
very much defaced. Two of the medals were
of Maximian and Gallienus; the rest were
so consumed, that I could not read the le∣gend.
You know, that on public occasions,
such as games, and certain sacrifices, hand∣fuls
of medals were thrown among the peo∣ple;
a practice, which accounts for the great
number which have been already found in
this district. I saw some subterranean passa∣ges,
which seemed to have been common-sewers;
and a great number of old walls still
standing along the brink of a precipice,
which overhangs the Paglion. The peasants
tell me, that they never dig above a yard in
depth, without finding vaults or cavities.
All the vineyards and garden-grounds, for a
considerable extent, are vaulted underneath;
and all the ground that produces their grapes,
fruit, and garden-stuff, is no more than the
crumbled lime and rubbish of old Roman
buildings, mixed with manure brought from
Nice. This antient town commanded a most
noble prospect of the sea; but is altogether
inaccessible by any kind of wheel carriage.
<PB N="269" REF="271"/>
If you make shift to climb to it on horseback,
you cannot descend to the plain again, with∣out
running the risk of breaking your neck.</P>
<P>About seven or eight miles on the other
side of Nice, are the remains of another
Roman monument, which has greatly suf∣fered
from the barbarity of successive ages.
It was a trophy erected by the senate of
Rome, in honour of Augustus Caesar, when
he had totally subdued all the ferocious na∣tions
of these Maritime Alps; such as the
Trumpilini Camuni, Vennonetes, Isnarci,
Breuni, &amp;c. It stands upon the top of a
mountain which overlooks the town of Mo∣naco,
and now exhibits the appearance of an
old ruined tower. There is a description of
what it was, in an Italian manuscript, by
which it appears to have been a beautiful
edifice of two stories, adorned with columns
and trophies in alto relievo, with a statue of
Augustus Caesar on the top. On one of the
sides was an inscription, some words of which
are still legible, upon the fragment of a mar∣ble
found close to the old building: but the
whole is preserved in Pliny, who gives it in
these words. lib. iii. cap. 20.</P>

<P>Pliny, however, is mistaken in placing
this inscription on a trophy near the <HI>Augusta

where, indeed, there is a triumphal arch,
but no inscription. This noble monument
of antiquity was first of all destroyed by
fire; and afterwards, in Gothic times, con∣verted
into a kind of fortification. The
marbles belonging to it were either employed
in adorning the church of the adjoining
<PB N="271" REF="273"/>
village<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was formerly a considerable town called Villae Martis, and pretends to the honour of having given birth to Aulus Helvius, who succeeded Commodus as emperor of Rome, by the name of Pertinax, which he acquired from his obstinate refusal of that dignity, when it was forced upon him by the senate. You know this man, though of very low birth, possessed many excellent qualities, and was basely murdered by the praetorian guards, at the instigation of Didius Julianus. For my part, I could never read without emotion, that celebrated elogium of the senate who ex∣claimed after his death, <HI>Pertinace imperante, securi viximus, neminem timuimus, patre pio, patre senatus, patre omnium bonorum.</HI></NOTE>, which is still called Turbia, a cor∣ruption
of Trophaea; or converted into
tomb-stones, or carried off to be preserved
in one or two churches of Nice. At present,
the work has the appearance of a ruinous
watch-tower, with Gothic battlements; and as
such stands undistinguished by those who tra∣vel
by by sea from hence to Genoa, and other
ports of Italy. I think I have now described all
the antiquities in the neighbourhood of Nice,
except some catacombs or caverns, dug in a
rock at St. Hospice, which Busching, in his
geography, has described as a strong town and
sea-port, though in fact, there is not the
least vestige either of town or village. It is
<PB N="272" REF="274"/>
a point of land almost opposite to the tower
of Turbia, with the mountains of which it
forms a bay, where there is a great and cu∣rious
fishery of the tunny fish, farmed of the
king of Sardinia. Upon this point there is
a watch-tower still kept in repair, to give
notice to the people in the neighbourhood, in
case any Barbary corsairs should appear on
the coast. The catacombs were in all pro∣bability
dug, in former times, as places of
retreat for the inhabitants upon sudden de∣scents
of the Saracens, who greatly infested
these seas for several successive centuries.
Many curious persons have entered them
and proceeded a considerable way by torch∣light,
without arriving at the further extre∣mity;
and the tradition of the country is,
that they reach as far as the ancient city of
Cemenelion; but this is an idle supposition,
almost as ridiculous as that which ascribes
them to the labour and ingenuity of the
fairies: they consist of narrow subterranean
passages, vaulted with stone and lined with
cement. Here and there one finds detached
apartments like small chambers, where I sup∣pose
the people remained concealed till the
<PB N="273" REF="275"/>
danger was over. Diodorus Siculus tells us,
that the antient inhabitants of this country
usually lived under ground. “<HI>Ligures in
terrâ cubant ut plurimum; plures ad cava saxa
speluncasque ab natura factas, ubi tegantur cor∣pora,
divertunt.</HI>” This was likewise the cus∣tom
of the Troglodytae, a people bordering
upon Aethiopia, who, according to Aelian,
lived in subterranean caverns; from whence,
indeed, they took their name <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signi∣fying
a cavern; and Virgil, in his Georgics,
describes them thus:</P>
<Q><L>“Ipsi in defossis specubus, secura sub alta</L>
<L>Ocia agunt terra.”—</L></Q>
<P>These are dry subjects; but such as the

which I am now scrawling may be useful,
if not entertaining: it is therefore the more

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>July 2, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NICE was originally a colony from
Marseilles. You know the Phocians
(if we may believe Justin and Polybius) set∣tled
in Gaul, and built Marseilles, during
the reign of Tarquinius Priscus at Rome.
This city flourished to such a degree, that
long before the Romans were in a condition
to extend their dominion, it sent forth colo∣nies,
and established them along the coast of
Liguria. Of these, Nice, or Nicaea, was one
of the most remarkable; so called, in all
probability, from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, sig∣nifying
<HI>Victoria,</HI> in consequence of some im∣portant
victory obtained over the Salij and
Ligures, who were the antient inhabitants of
this country. Nice, with its mother city,
being in the sequel subdued by the Romans,
fell afterwards successively under the domi∣nion
of the Goths, B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgundians, and Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nks
<PB N="275" REF="277"/>
the kings of Arles, and the kings of Naples, as
counts of Provence. In the year one thou∣sand
three hundred and eighty-eight, the
city and county of Nice being but ill pro∣tected
by the family of Durazzo, voluntarily
surrendered themselves to Amadaeus, sur∣named
the Red, duke of Savoy; and since
that period, they have continued as part of
that potentate's dominions, except at such
times as they have been over-run and pos∣sessed
by the power of France, which hath
always been a troublesome neighbour to this
country. The castle was begun by the Arra∣gonian
counts of Provence, and afterwards
enlarged by several successive dukes of Savoy,
so as to be deemed impregnable, until the
modern method of besieging began to take
place. A fruitless attempt was made upon
it in the year one thousand five hundred and
forty-three, by the French and Turks in
conjunction: but it was reduced several times
after that period, and is now in ruins. The
celebrated engineer Vauban, being command∣ed
by Louis XIV. to give in a plan for forti∣fying
Nice, proposed, that the river Paglion
should be turned into a new channel, so as
<PB N="276" REF="278"/>
to surround the town to the north, and fall
into the harbour; that where the Paglion
now runs to the westward of the city walls,
there should be a deep ditch to be filled with
sea-water; and that a fortress should be built
to the westward of this fosse. These particu∣lars
might be executed at no very great ex∣pence;
but, I apprehend, they would be in∣effectual,
as the town is commanded by eve∣ry
hill in the neighbourhood; and the exha∣lations
from stagnating sea-water would in∣fallibly
render the air unwholesome. Not∣withstanding
the undoubted antiquity of
Nice, very few monuments of that antiquity
now remain. The inhabitants say, they
were either destroyed by the Saracens in their
successive descents upon the coast, by the bar∣barous
nations in their repeated incursions,
or used in fortifying the castle, as well as in
building other edifices. The city of Ceme∣nelion,
however, was subject to the same dis∣asters,
and even entirely ruined; neverthe∣less,
we still find remains of its antient splen∣dor.
There have been likewise a few stones
found at Nice, with antient inscriptions; but
there is nothing of this kind standing, un∣less
<PB N="277" REF="279"/>
we give the name of antiquity to a mar∣ble
cross on the road to Provence, about half
a mile from the city. It stands upon a
pretty high pedestal with steps, under a pretty
stone cupola or dome, supported by four Ionic
pillars, on the spot where Charles V. empe∣ror
of Germany, Francis I. of France, and
pope Paul II. agreed to have a conference,
in order to determine all their disputes. The
emperor came higher by sea, with a power∣ful
fleet, and the French king by land, at
the head of a numerous army. All the en∣deavours
of his holiness, however, could not
effect a peace; but they agreed to a truce
of ten years. Mezerai affirms, that these
two great princes never saw one another on
this occasion; and that this shyness was ow∣ing
to the management of the pope, whose
private designs might have been frustrated,
had they come to a personal interview. In
the front of the colonade, there is a small
stone, with an inscription in Latin, which
is so high, and so much defaced, that I can∣not
read it.</P>
<P>In the sixteenth century there was a col∣lege
erected at Nice, by Emanuel Philibert,
<PB N="278" REF="280"/>
duke of Savoy, for granting degrees to stu∣dents
of law; and in the year one thousand
six hundred and fourteen, Charles Emanuel
I. instituted the senate of Nice; consisting
of a president, and a certain number of se∣nators,
who are distinguished by their pur∣ple
robes, and other ensigns of authority.
They administer justice, having the power of
life and death, not only through the whole
county of Nice, but causes are evoked from
Oneglia, and some other places, to their tri∣bunal,
which is the <HI>dernier resort,</HI> from
whence there is no appeal. The command∣ant,
however, by virtue of his military power
and unrestricted authority, takes upon him
to punish individuals by imprisonment, cor∣poral
pains, and banishment, without consult∣ing
the senate, or indeed, observing any
form of trial. The only redress against any
unjust exercise of this absolute power, is by
complaint to the king; and you know, what
chance a poor man has for being redressed in
this manner.</P>
<P>With respect to religion, I may safely say,
that here superstition reigns under the darkest
shades of ignorance and prejudice. I think
<PB N="279" REF="281"/>
there are ten convents and three nunneries
within and without the walls of Nice; and
among them all, I never could hear of one
man who had made any tolerable advances
in any kind of human learning. All eccle∣siastics
are exempted from any exertion of
civil power, being under the immediate pro∣tection
and authority of the bishop, or his
vicar. The bishop of Nice is suffragan of
the archbishop of Ambrun in France; and
the revenues of the see amount to between
five and six hundred pounds sterling. We
have likewise an office of the inquisition,
though I do not hear that it presumes to
execute any acts of jurisdiction, without the
king's special permission. All the churches
are sanctuaries for all kinds of criminals, ex∣cept
those guilty of high treason; and the
priests are extremely jealous of their privi∣leges
in this particular. They receive, with
open arms, murderers, robbers, smugglers,
fraudulent bankrupts, and felons of every
denomination; and never give them up, until
after having stipulated for their lives and li∣berty.
I need not enlarge upon the perni∣cious
consequences of this infamous prero∣gative,
<PB N="280" REF="282"/>
calculated to raise and extend the
power and influence of the Roman church,
on the ruins of morality and good order. I
saw a fellow, who had three days before mur∣dered
his wife in the last month of preg∣nancy,
taking the air with great composure
and serenity, on the steps of a church in
Florence; and nothing is more common,
than to see the most execrable villains divert∣ing
themselves in the cloysters of some con∣vents
at Rome.</P>
<P>Nice abounds with noblesse, marquisses,
counts, and barons. Of these, three or four
families are really respectable: the rest are
<HI>novi homines,</HI> sprung from Bourgeois, who
have saved a little money by their different
occupations, and raised themselves to the
rank of noblesse by purchase. One is de∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended
from an avocat; another from an
apothecary; a third from a retailer of wine,
a fourth from a dealer in anchovies; and I
am told, there is actually a count at Ville∣franche,
whose father sold macaroni in the
streets. A man in this country may buy a
marquisate, or a county, for the value of
three or four hundred pounds sterling, and
<PB N="281" REF="283"/>
the title follows the fief: but he may pur∣chase
<HI>lettres de noblesse</HI> for about thirty or forty
guineas. In Savoy, there are six hundred fa∣milies
of noblesse; the greater part of which
have not above one hundred crowns a year to
maintain their dignity. In the mountains of
Piedmont, and even in this county of Nice,
there are some representatives of very antient
and noble families, reduced to the condition
of common peasants; but they still retain the
antient pride of their houses, and boast of
the noble blood that runs in their veins. A
gentleman told me, that in travelling through
the mountains, he was obliged to pass a
night in the cottage of one of these rusticated
nobles, who called to his son in the evening,
“<HI>Chevalier, as tu donné a manger aux cochons.</HI>”
This, however, is not the case with the no∣blesse
of Nice. Two or three of them have
about four or five hundred a year: the rest,
in general, may have about one hundred
pistoles, arising from the silk, oil, wine,
and oranges, produced in their small planta∣tions,
where they have also country houses.
Some few of these are well built, commodi∣ous,
and agreeably situated; but, for the
<PB N="282" REF="284"/>
most part, they are miserable enough. Our
noblesse, notwithstanding their origin, and
the cheap rate at which their titles have been
obtained, are nevertheless extremely tenacious
of their privileges, very delicate in maintain∣ing
the <HI>etiquette,</HI> and keep at a very stately
distance from the Bourgeoisie. How they
live in their families, I do not choose to en∣quire;
but, in public, Madame appears in
her robe of gold, or silver stuff, with her
powder and frisure, her persumes, her paint
and her patches; while Monsieur Le Comte
struts about in his lace and embroidery.
Rouge and fard are more peculiarly necessary
in this country, where the complexion and
skin are naturally swarthy and yellow. I
have likewise observed, that most of the fe∣males
are pot-bellied; a circumstance ow∣ing,
I believe, to the great quantity of ve∣getable
trash which they eat. All the horses,
mules, asses, and cattle, which feed upon
grass, have the same distension. This kind
of food produces such acid juices in the sto∣mach,
as excite a perpetual sense of hunger.
I have been often amazed at the voracious
appetites of these people. You must not
<PB N="283" REF="285"/>
expect that I should describe the tables and
the hospitality of our Nissard gentry. Our
consul, who is a very honest man, told me,
he had lived four and thirty years in the
country, without having once eat or drank
in any of their houses.</P>
<P>The noblesse of Nice cannot leave the
country without express leave from the king;
and this leave, when obtained, is for a li∣mited
time, which they dare not exceed, on
pain of incurring his majesty's displeasure.
They must, therefore, endeavour to find
amusements at home; and this, I appre∣hend,
would be no easy task for people of
an active spirit or restless disposition. True
it is, the religion of the country supplies a
never-failing fund of pastime to those who
have any relish for devotion; and this is
here a prevailing taste. We have had tran∣sient
visits of a puppet-shew, strolling musi∣cians,
and rope-dancers; but they did not
like their quarters, and decamped without
beat of drum. In the summer, about eight
or nine at night, part of the noblesse may be
seen assembled in a place called the Parc;
which is, indeed, a sort of a street formed
<PB N="284" REF="286"/>
by a row of very paltry houses on one side,
and on the other, by part of the town-wall,
which screens it from a prospect of the sea,
the only object that could render it agreeable.
Here you may perceive the noblesse stretched
in pairs upon logs of wood, like so many
feals upon the rocks by moon-light, each
dame with her <HI>cicisbeo:</HI> for, you must un∣derstand,
this Italian fashion prevails at
Nice among all ranks of people; and there
is not such a passion as jealousy known. The
husband and the <HI>cicisbeo</HI> live together as
sworn brothers; and the wife and the mis∣tress
embrace each other with marks of the
warmest affection. I do not choose to enter
into particulars. I cannot open the scanda∣lous
chronicle of Nice, without hazard of
contamination. With respect to delicacy and
decorum, you may peruse dean Swift's de∣scription
of the Yahoos, and then you will
have some idea of the <HI>sporcherie,</HI> that distin∣guishes
the gallantry of Nice. But the Parc
is not the only place of public resort for our
noblesse in a summer's evening. Just without
one of our gates, you will find them seated
in ditches on the highway side, serenaded
<PB N="285" REF="287"/>
with the croaking of frogs, and the bells and
braying of mules and asses continually passing
in a perpetual cloud of dust. Besides these
amusements, there is a public <HI>conversazione</HI>
every evening at the commandant's house
called the Government, where those noble
personages play at cards for farthings. In
carnival time, there is also, at this same go∣vernment,
a ball twice or thrice a week, car∣ried
on by subscription. At this assembly
every person, without distinction, is per∣mitted
to dance in masquerade: but, after
dancing, they are obliged to unmask, and if
Bourgeois, to retire. No individual can give
a ball, without obtaining a permission and
guard of the commandant; and then his
house is open to all masques, without di∣stinction,
who are provided with tickets,
which tickets are sold by the commandant's
secretary, at five sols a-piece, and delivered
to the guard at the door. If I have a mind
to entertain my particular friends, I cannot
have more than a couple of violins; and, in
that case, it is called a <HI>conversazione.</HI></P>
<P>Though the king of Sardinia takes all op∣portunities
to distinguish the subjects of
<PB N="286" REF="288"/>
Great-Britain with particular marks of re∣spect,
I have seen enough to be convinced,
that our nation is looked upon with an evil
eye by the people of Nice; and this arises
partly from religious prejudices, and partly
from envy, occasioned by a ridiculous no∣tion
of our superior wealth. For my own
part, I owe them nothing on the score of
civilities; and therefore, I shall say nothing
more on the subject, lest I should be tempted
to deviate from that temperance and impar∣tiality
which I would fain hope have hi∣therto
characterised the remarks of,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>May 2, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote in May to Mr. B—at Geneva,
and gave him what information he desi∣red
to have, touching the conveniences of
Nice. I shall now enter into the same de∣tain,
for the benefit of such of your friends
or patients, as may have occasion to try this
climate.</P>
<P>The journey from Calais to Nice, of four
persons in a coach, or two post-chaises, with
a servant on horseback, travelling post, may
be performed with ease, for about one hun∣dred
and twenty pounds, including every
expence. Either at Calais or at Paris, you
will always find a travelling coach or berline,
which you may buy for thirty or forty gui∣neas,
and this will serve very well to re∣convey
you to your own country.</P>
<P>In the town of Nice, you will find no
ready-furnished lodgings for a whole family.
<PB N="288" REF="290"/>
Just without one of the gates, there are two
houses to be let, ready-furnished, for about
five loui'dores per month. As for the coun∣try
houses in this neighbourhood, they are
damp in winter, and generally without chim∣nies;
and in summer they are rendered unin∣habitable
by the heat and the vermin. If
you hire a tenement in Nice, you must take
it for a year certain; and this will cost you
about twenty pounds sterling. For this price,
I have a ground floor paved with brick,
consisting of a kitchen, two large halls, a
couple of good rooms with chimnies, three
large closets that serve for bed-chambers,
and dressing-rooms, a butler's room, and
three apartments for servants lumber or
stores, to which we ascend by narrow wooden
stairs. I have likewise two small gardens,
well stocked with oranges, lemons, peaches,
figs, grapes, corinths, sallad, and pot-herbs.
It is supplied with a draw-well of good wa∣ter,
and there is another in the vestibule of
the house, which is cool, large, and magni∣ficent.
You may hire furniture for such a
tenement, for about two guineas a month:
but I chose rather to buy what was necessary;
<PB N="289" REF="291"/>
and this cost me about sixty pounds. I sup∣pose
it will fetch me about half the money
when I leave the place. It is very difficult
to find a tolerable cook at Nice. A common
maid, who serves the people of the country,
for three or four livres a month, will not
live with an English family under eight or
ten. They are all slovenly, slothful, and
unconscionable cheats. The markets at Nice
are tolerably well supplied. Their beef,
which comes from Piedmont, is pretty good,
and we have it all the year. In the winter,
we have likewise excellent pork, and delicate
lamb; but the mutton is indifferent. Pied∣mont,
also, affords us delicious capons, fed
with maiz; and this country produces excel∣lent
turkeys, but very few geese. Chickens
and pullets are extremely meagre. I have
tried to fatten them, without success. In
summer they are subject to the pip, and die
in great numbers. Autumn and winter are
the seasons for game; hares, partridges,
quails, wild-pigeons, woodcocks, snipes,
thrushes, beccaficas, and ortolans. Wild-boar
is sometimes found in the mountains:
<PB N="290" REF="292"/>
it has a delicious taste, not unlike that of
the wild-hog in Jamaica; and would make
an excellent barbecue, about the beginning
of winter, when it is in good case: but,
when meagre, the head only is presented at
tables. Pheasants are very scarce. As for
the heath-game, I never saw but one cock,
which my servant bought in the market, and
brought home; but the commandant's cook
came into my kitchen, and carried it off, af∣ter
it was half plucked, saying, his master
had company to dinner. The hares are large,
plump, and juicy. The partridges are gene∣rally
of the red sort; large as pullets, and of
a good flavour: there are also some grey par∣tridges
in the mountains; and another sort
of a white colour, that weigh four or five
pounds each. Beccaficas are smaller than
sparrows, but very fat, and they are generally
eaten half raw. The best way of dressing
them, is to stuff them into a roll, scooped
of it's crum; to baste them well with butter,
and roast them, until they are brown and
crisp. The ortolans are kept in cages, and
crammed, until they die of fat, then eaten
<PB N="291" REF="293"/>
as dainties. The thrush is presented with
the trail, because the bird feeds on olives.
They may as well eat the trail of a sheep,
because it feeds on the aromatic herbs of the
mountain. In the summer, we have beef,
veal, and mutton, chicken, and ducks;
which last are very fat, and very flabby. All
the meat is tough in this season, because the
excessive heat, and great number of flies, will
not admit of its being kept any time after it
is killed. Butter and milk, though not very
delicate, we have all the year. Our tea and
fine sugar come from Marseilles, at a very
reasonable price.</P>
<P>Nice is not without variety of fish; though
they are not counted so good in their kinds
as those of the ocean. Soals, and flat-fish
in general, are scarce. Here are some mul∣lets,
both grey and red. We sometimes see
the dory, which is called <HI>St. Pietro;</HI> with
rock-fish, bonita, and mackarel. The gur∣nard
appears pretty often; and there is
plenty of a king of large whiting, which eats
pretty well; but has not the delicacy of that
which is caught on our coast. One of the
best fish of this country, is called <HI>Le Loup,</HI>
<PB N="292" REF="294"/>
about two or three pounds in weight; white,
firm, and well-flavoured. Another, no-way
inferior to it, is the <HI>Moustel,</HI> about the same
size; of a dark-grey colour, and short, blunt
snout; growing thinner and flatter from the
shoulders downwards, so as to resemble a
soal at the tail. This cannot be the <HI>mustela</HI>
of the antients, which is supposed to be the
sea lamprey. Here too are found the <HI>vyvre,</HI>
or, as we call it, weaver; remarkable for its
long, sharp spines, so dangerous to the fin∣gers
of the fishermen. We have abundance
of the <HI>saepie,</HI> or cuttle-fish, of which the
people in this country make a delicate ragout;
as also of the <HI>polype de mer,</HI> which is an ugly
animal, with long feelers, like tails, which
they often wind about the legs of the fisher∣men.
They are stewed with onions, and eat
something like cow-heel. The market some∣times
affords the <HI>ecrivisse de mer,</HI> which is a
lobster without claws, of a sweetish taste;
and there are a few rock oysters, very small
and very rank. Sometimes the fishermen find
under water, pieces of a very hard cement,
like plaister of Paris, which contain a kind
of muscle, called <HI>la datte,</HI> from its resem∣blance
<PB N="293" REF="295"/>
to a date. These petrefactions are
commonly of a triangular form, and may
weigh about twelve or fifteen pounds each;
and one of them may contain a dozen of
these muscles, which have nothing extraor∣dinary
in the taste or flavour, though ex∣tremely
curious, as found alive and juicy,
in the heart of a rock, almost as hard as
marble, without any visible communication
with the air or water. I take it for granted,
however, that the inclosing cement is po∣rous,
and admits the finer parts of the sur∣rounding
fluid. In order to reach the mus∣cels,
this cement must be broke with large
hammers; and it may be truly said, the ker∣nel
is not worth the trouble of cracking the
shell. Among the fish of this country, there
is a very ugly animal of the eel species,
which might pass for a serpent: it is of a
dusky, black colour, marked with spots of
yellow, about eighteen inches, or two feet
long. The Italians call it <HI>murena;</HI> but whe∣ther
it is the fish which had the same name
among the antient Romans, I cannot pre∣tend
to determine. The antient murena was
counted a great delicacy, and was kept in
<PB N="294" REF="296"/>
ponds for extraordinary occasions. Julius
Caesar borrowed six thousand for one enter∣tainment:
but I imagined this was the river
lamprey. The murena of this country is in
no esteem, and only eaten by the poor peo∣ple.
Craw-fish and trout are rarely found in
the rivers among the mountains. The sword-fish
is much esteemed in Nice, and called
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>empereur,</HI> about six or seven feet long: but
I have never seen it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since I wrote the above letter, I have eaten several times of this fish, which is as white as the finest veal, and extremely delicate. The emperor associates with the tunny fish, and is always taken in their company.</NOTE> They are very scarce;
and when taken, are generally concealed,
because the head belongs to the commandant,
who has likewise the privilege of buying the
best fish at a very low price. For which
reason, the choice pieces are concealed by
the fishermen, and sent privately to Pied∣mont
or Genoa. But, the chief fisheries on
this coast, are of the sardines, anchovies,
and tunny. These are taken in small quan∣tities
all the year: but spring and summer
is the season when they mostly abound. In
June and July, a fleet of about fifty fishing-boats,
<PB N="295" REF="297"/>
puts to sea every evening about eight
o'clock, and catch anchovies in immense
quantities. One small boat sometimes takes
in one night twenty-five rup, amounting to
six hundred weight; but it must be observed,
that the pound here, as well as in other
parts of Italy, consists but of twelve ounces.
Anchovies, besides their making a considera∣ble
article in the commerce of Nice, are a
great resource in all families. The noblesse
and bourgeois fup on sallad and anchovies,
which are eaten on all their meagre days.
The fishermen and mariners all along this
coast have scarce any other food but dry
bread, with a few pickled anchovies; and
when the fish is eaten, they rub their crusts
with the brine. Nothing can be more deli∣cious
than fresh anchovies fried in oil: I
prefer them to the smelts of the Thames. I
need not mention, that the sardines and an∣chovies
are caught in nets; salted, barrelled,
and exported into all the different kingdoms
and states of Europe. The sardines, how∣ever,
are largest and fattest in the month of
September. A company of adventurers have
farmed the tunny-fishery of the king, for
<PB N="296" REF="298"/>
six years; a monopoly, for which they pay
about three thousand pounds sterling. They
are at a very considerable expence for nets,
boats, and attendance. Their nets are dis∣posed
in a very curious manner across the
small bay of St. Hospice, in this neighbour∣hood,
where the fish chiefly resort. They
are never removed, except in the winter,
and when they want repair: but there are
avenues for the fish to enter, and pass, from
one inclosure to another. There is a man
in a boat, who constantly keeps watch.
When he perceives they are fairly entered,
he has a method for shutting all the passes,
and confining the fish to one apartment of
the net, which is lifted up into the boat,
until the prisoners are taken and secured.
The tunny-fish generally runs from fifty to
one hundred weight; but some of them are
much larger. They are immediately gutted,
boiled, and cut in slices. The guts and head
afford oil: the slices are partly dried, to be
eaten occasionally with oil and vinegar, or
barrelled up in oil, to be exported. It is
counted a delicacy in Italy and Piedmont,
and tastes not unlike sturgeon. The famous
<PB N="297" REF="299"/>
pickle of the ancients, called garum, was
made of the gills and blood of the tunny,
or thynnus. There is a much more conside∣rable
fishery of it in Sardinia, where it is
said to employ four hundred persons; but
this belongs to the duc de St. Pierre. In the
neighbourhood of Villa Franca, there are
people always employed in fishing for coral
and sponge, which grow adhering to the
rocks under water. Their methods do not
savour much of ingenuity. For the coral,
they lower down a swab, composed of what
is called spunyarn on board our ships of war,
hanging in distinct threads, and sunk by
means of a great weight, which striking
against the coral in its descent, disengages it
from the rocks; and some of the pieces be∣ing
intangled among the threads of the
swab, are brought up with it above water.
The sponge is got by means of a cross-stick,
fitted with hooks, which being lowered
down, fastens upon it, and tears it from the
rocks. In some parts of the Adriatic and
Archipelago, these substances are gathered
by divers, who can remain five minutes be∣low
water. But I will not detain you one
<PB N="298" REF="300"/>
minute longer; though I must observe, that
there is plenty of fine samphire growing
along all these rocks, neglected and un∣known.
Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>October 10, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I tell you the price of provi∣sions
at Nice, it will be necessary to say
something of the money. The gold coin of
Sardinia consists of the doppia di savoia,
value twenty-four livres Piedmontese, about
the size of a loui'dore; and the mezzo dop∣pia,
or piece of twelve livres. In silver,
there is the scudo of six livres, the mezzo
scudo of three; and the quarto, or pezza di
trenta soldi: but all these are very scarce.
We seldom see any gold and silver coin, but
the loui'dore, and the six, and three-livre
pieces of France; a sure sign that the
French suffer by their contraband commerce
<PB N="299" REF="301"/>
with the Nissards. The coin chiefly used at
market is a piece of copper silvered, that
passes for seven sols and a half; another of
the same sort, value two sols and a half.
They have on one side the impression of
the king's head; and on the other, the
arms of Savoy, with a ducal crown, inscribed
with his name and titles. There are of ge∣nuine
copper, pieces of one sol, stamped on
one side with a cross fleuree; and on the re∣verse,
with the king's cypher and crown,
inscribed as the others: finally, there is ano∣ther
small copper piece, called piccalon, the
sixth part of a sol, with a plain cross, and
on the reverse, a slip-knot surmounted with
a crown; the legend as above. The im∣pression
and legend on the gold and silver
coins, are the same as those on the pieces of
seven sols and a half. The livre of Piedmont
consists of twenty sols, and is very near of
the same value as an English shilling: ten
sols, therefore, are equal to six-pence sterling.
Butcher's meat in general sells at Nice for
three sols a pound; and veal is something
dearer: but then there are but twelve ounces
in the pound, which being allowed for, six∣teen
<PB N="300" REF="302"/>
ounces, come for something less than
twopence halfpenny English. Fish commonly
sells for four sols the twelve ounces, or five
for the English pound; and these five are
equivalent to three-pence of our money: but
sometimes we are obliged to pay five, and
even six sols for the Piedmontese pound of
fish. A turkey that would sell for five or six
shillings at the London market, costs me but
three at Nice. I can buy a good capon for
thirty sols, or eighteen-pence; and the same
price I pay for a brace of partridges, or a
good hare. I can have a woodcock for
twenty-four sols; but the pigeons are dearer
than in London. Rabbits are very rare;
and there is scarce a goose to be seen in the
whole county of Nice. Wild-ducks and teal
are sometimes to be had in the winter; and
now I am speaking of sea-fowl, it may not
be amiss to tell you what I know of the hal∣cyon,
or king's-fisher. It is a bird, though
very rare in this country, about the size of a
pigeon; the body brown, and the belly
white: by a wonderful instinct, it makes its
nest upon the surface of the sea, and lays it's
eggs in the month of November, when the
<PB N="301" REF="303"/>
Mediterranean is always calm and smooth as
a mill-pond. The people here call them
martinets, because they begin to hatch about
Martinmass. Their nests are sometimes seen
floating near the shore, and generally become
the prize of the boys, who are very alert in
catching them.</P>
<P>You know all sea-birds are allowed by the
church of Rome to be eaten on meagre days,
as a kind of fish; and the monks especially
do not fail to make use of this permission.
Sea turtle, or tortoises, are often found at
sea by the mariners, in these latitudes: but
they are not the green sort, so much in re∣quest
among the aldermen of London. All
the Mediterranean turtle are of the kind cal∣led
loggerhead, which in the West-Indies are
eaten by none but hungry seamen, negroes,
and the lowest class of people. One of these,
weighing about two hundred pounds, was
lately brought on shore by the fishermen of
Nice, who found it floating asleep on the sur∣face
of the sea. The whole town was alarm∣ed
at sight of such a monster, the nature of
which they could not comprehend. How∣ever,
the monks, called <HI>minims,</HI> of St.
<PB N="302" REF="304"/>
Francesco di Paolo, guided by a sure instinct,
marked it as their prey, and surrounded it
accordingly. The friars of other convents,
not quite so hungry, crowding down to the
beach, declared it should not be eaten;
dropped some hints about the possibility of
its being something praeternatural and diabo∣lical,
and even proposed exorcisms and asper∣sions
with holy water. The populace were
divided according to their attachment to this,
or that convent: a mighty clamour arose;
and the police, in order to remove the cause
of their contention, ordered the tortoise to
be re-committed to the waves; a sentence
which the Franciscans saw executed, not
without sighs and lamentation. The land-turtle,
or terrapin, is much better known at
Nice, as being a native of this county; yet
the best are brought from the island of Sar∣dinia.
The soup or <HI>bouillon</HI> of this animal
is always prescribed here as a great restorative
to consumptive patients. The bread of Nice
is very indifferent, and I am persuaded very
unwholsome. The flour is generally musty,
and not quite free of sand. This is either
owing to the particles of the mill-stone rub∣bed
<PB N="303" REF="305"/>
off in grinding, or to what adheres to
the corn itself, in being threshed upon the
common ground; for there are no threshing-floors
in this country. I shall now take no∣tice
of the vegetables of Nice. In the win∣ter,
we have green pease, asparagus, arti∣choaks,
cauliflower, beans, French beans,
celery, and endive; cabbage, coleworts, ra∣dishes,
turnips, carrots, betteraves, sorrel,
lettuce, onions, garlic, and chalot. We
have potatoes from the mountains, mush∣rooms,
champignons, and truffles. Piedmont
affords white truffles, counted the most deli∣cious
in the world: they sell for about three
livres the pound. The fruits of this season,
are pickled olives, oranges, lemons, citrons,
citronelles, dried figs, grapes, apples, pears,
almonds, chesnuts, walnuts, filberts, med∣lars,
pomegranates, and a fruit called aze∣rolles,
about the size of a nutmeg, of an
oblong shape, red colour, and agreeable acid
taste. I might likewise add the cherry of
the <HI>laurus cerasus,</HI> which is sold in the mar∣ket;
very beautiful to the eye, but insipid
to the palate. In summer we have all those
vegetables in perfection. There is also a kind
<PB N="304" REF="306"/>
of small courge, or gourd, of which the
people of the country make a very savoury
ragout, with the help of eggs, cheese, and
fresh anchovies. Another is made of the
badenjean, which the Spaniards call beren∣gena:
it is much eaten in Spain and the
Levant, as well as by the Moors in Barbary.
It is about the size and shape of a hen's egg,
inclosed in a cup like an acorn; when ripe,
of a faint purple colour. It grows on a
stalk about a foot high, with long spines or
prickles. The people here have different
ways of slicing and dressing it, by broiling,
boiling, and stewing, with other ingredients:
but it is at best an insipid dish. There are
some caper-bushes in this neighbourhood,
which grow wild in holes of garden walls,
and require no sort of cultivation: in one
or two gardens, there are palm-trees; but
the dates never ripen. In my register of the
weather, I have marked the seasons of the
principal fruits in this country. In May we
have strawberries, which continue in season
two or three months. These are of the wood
kind; very grateful, and of a good flavour;
but the scarlets and hautboys are not known
<PB N="305" REF="307"/>
at Nice. In the beginning of June, and
even sooner, the cherries begin to be ripe.
They are a kind of bleeding hearts; large,
fleshy, and high flavoured, though rather
too luscious. I have likewise seen a few of
those we call Kentish cherries, which are
much more cool, acid, and agreeable, espe∣cially
in this hot climate. The cherries are
succeeded by the apricots and peaches, which
are all standards, and of consequence better
flavoured than what we call wall-fruit. The
trees, as well as almonds, grow and bear
without care and cultivation, and may be
seen in the open fields about Nice: but
without proper culture, the fruit degenerates.
The best peaches I have seen at Nice are
the almberges, of a yellow hue, and oblong
shape, about the size of a small lemon.
Their consistence is much more solid than
that of our English peaches, and their taste
more delicious. Several trees of this kind I
have in my own garden. Here is likewise
plenty of other sorts; but no nectarines.
We have little choice of plumbs. Neither
do I admire the pears or apples of this
country: but the most agreeable apples I
<PB N="306" REF="308"/>
ever tasted, come from Final, and are called
pomi carli. The greatest fault I find with
most fruits in this climate, is, that they are
too sweet and luscious, and want that agree∣able
acid which is so cooling and so grate∣ful
in a hot country. This, too, is the case
with our grapes, of which there is great
plenty and variety, plump and juicy, and
large as plumbs. Nature, however, has not
neglected to provide other agreeable vegetable
juices to cool the human body. During the
whole summer, we have plenty of musk me∣lons.
I can buy one as large as my head for
the value of an English penny: but one of
the best and largest, weighing ten or twelve
pounds, I can have for twelve sols, or about
eight-pence sterling. From Antibes and
Sardinia, we have another fruit called a
water-melon, which is well known in Ja∣maica,
and some of our other colonies.
Those from Antibes are about the size of an
ordinary bomb-shell: but the Sardinian and
Jamaica water-melons are four times as large.
The skin is green, smooth, and thin. The
inside is a purple pulp, studded with broad,
flat, black seeds, and impregnated with a juice
<PB N="307" REF="309"/>
the most cool, delicate, and refreshing, that
can well be conceived. One would imagine
the pulp itself dissolved in the stomach; for
you may eat of it until you are filled up to
the tongue, without feeling the least incon∣venience.
It is so friendly to the constitu∣tion,
that in ardent inflammatory fevers, it
is drank as the best emulsion. At Genoa,
Florence, and Rome, it is sold in the streets,
ready cut in slices; and the porters, sweating
under their burthens, buy and eat them as
they pass. A porter of London quenches his
thirst with a draught of strong beer: a por∣ter
of Rome, or Naples, refreshes himself
with a slice of water-melon, or a glass of
iced-water. The one costs three half-pence▪
the last, half a farthing—which of them is
most effectual? I am sure the men are equally
pleased. It is commonly remarked, that beer
strengthens as well as refreshes. But the
porters of Constantinople, who never drink
any thing stronger than water, and eat very
little animal food, will lift and carry heavier
burthens than any other porters in the
known world. If we may believe the most
respectable travellers, a Turk will carry a
<PB N="308" REF="310"/>
load of seven hundred weight, which is more
(I believe) than any English porter ever at∣tempted
to raise.</P>
<P>Among the refreshments of these warm
countries, I ought not to forget mentioning
the sorbettes, which are sold in coffee-houses,
and places of public re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort. They are iced
froth, made with juice of oranges, apricots,
or peaches; very agreeable to the palate, and
so extremely cold, that I was afraid to swal∣low
them in this hot country, until I found
from information and experience, that they
may be taken in moderation, without any
bad consequence.</P>
<P>Another considerable article in house-keep∣ing
is wine, which we have here good and
reasonable. The wine of Tavelle in Lan∣guedoc
is very near as good as Burgundy,
and may be had at Nice, at the rate of six-pence
a bottle. The sweet wine of St. Lau∣rent,
counted equal to thast of Frontignan,
costs about eight or nine-pence a quart:
pretty good Malaga may be had for half the
money. Those who make their own wine
choose the grapes from different vineyards,
and have them picked, pressed, and fer∣mented
<PB N="309" REF="311"/>
at home. That which is made by
the peasants, both red and white, is generally
genuine: but the wine-merchants of Nice
brew and balderdash, and even mix it with
pigeons dung and quick-lime. It cannot
be supposed, that a stranger and sojourner
should buy his own grapes, and make his
own provision of wine: but he may buy it
by recommendation from the peasants, for
about eighteen or twenty livres the charge,
consisting of eleven rup five pounds; in
other words, of two hundred and eighty
pounds of this country, so as to bring it for
something less than three-pence a quart. The
Nice wine, when mixed with water, makes
an agreeable beverage. There is an inferior
sort for servants, drank by the common peo∣ple,
which in the cabaret does not cost above
a penny a bottle. The people here are not
so nice as the English, in the management
of their wine. It is kept in flacons, or large
flasks, without corks, having a little oil at
top. It is not deemed the worse for having
been opened a day or two before; and they
expose it to the hot sun, and all kinds of
weather, without hesitation. Certain it is,
<PB N="310" REF="312"/>
this treatment has little or no effect upon its
taste, flavour, and transparency.</P>
<P>The brandy of Nice is very indifferent;
and the <HI>liqueurs</HI> are so sweetened with coarse
sugar, that they scarce retain the taste or
flavour of any other ingredient.</P>
<P>The last article of domestic oeconomy
which I shall mention is fuel, or wood for
firing, which I buy for eleven sols (a little
more than six-pence halfpenny) a quintal,
consisting of one hundred and fifty pound
Nice weight. The best, which is of oak,
comes from Sardinia. The common sort is
olive, which being cut with the sap in it,
ought to be laid in during the summer;
otherwise, it will make a very uncomfortable
fire. In my kitchen and two chambers, I
burned fifteen thousand weight of wood in
four weeks, exclusive of charcoal for the kit∣chen
stoves, and of pine-tops for lighting
the fires. These last are as large as pine∣apples,
which they greatly resemble in shape,
and to which, indeed, they give their name;
and being full of turpentine, make a won∣derful
blaze. For the same purpose, the peo∣ple
of these countries use the sarments, or
<PB N="311" REF="313"/>
cuttings of the vines, which they sell made
up in small fascines. This great consumption
of wood is owing to the large fires used in
roasting pieces of beef, and joints, in the
English manner. The roasts of this country
seldom exceed two or three pounds of meat;
and their other plats are made over stove-holes.
But it is now high time to conduct
you from the kitchen, where you have been
too long detained by</P>
<CLOSER>Your humble servant.
<HI>P. S.</HI> I have mentioned the prices of al∣most
all the articles in house-keeping, as
they are paid by the English: but exclusive
of butcher's meat, I am certain the natives
do not pay so much by thirty per cent. Their
imposition on us, is not only a proof of
their own villany and hatred, but a scandal
on their government; which ought to inter∣fere
in favour of the subjects of a nation,
to which they are so much bound in point of
policy, as well as gratitude.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>October 22, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have nothing else to do, but to sa∣tisfy
my own curiosity, and that of
my friends, I obey your injunctions with
pleasure; though not without some appre∣hension
that my inquiries will afford you
very little entertainment. The place where
I am is of very little importance or conse∣quence
as a state or community; neither
is there any thing curious or interesting in the
character or oeconomy of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>There are some few merchants in Nice,
said to be in good circumstances. I know
one of them, who deals to a considerable ex∣tent,
and goes twice a year to London to at∣tend
the sales of the East-India company.
He buys up a very large quantity of muflins,
and other India goods, and freights a ship in
the river to transport them to Villa Franca.
Some of these are sent to Swisserland; but,
<PB N="313" REF="315"/>
I believe, the greater part is smuggled into
France, by virtue of counterfeit stamps,
which are here used without any ceremony.
Indeed, the chief commerce of this place is
a contraband traffick carried on to the disadvan∣tage
of France; and I am told, that the far∣mers
of the Levant company in that kingdom
find their account in conniving at it. Certain it
is, a great quantity of merchandize is brought
hither every week by mules from Turin and
other parts in Piedmont, and afterwards con∣veyed
to the other side of the Var, either by
land or water. The mules of Piedmont are
exceeding strong and hardy. One of them
will carry a burthen of near six hundred
weight. They are easily nourished, and re∣quire
no other respite from their labour, but
the night's repose. They are the only car∣riage
that can be used in crossing the moun∣tains,
being very sure-footed: and it is ob∣served,
that in choosing their steps, they al∣ways
march upon the brink of the precipice.
You must let them take their own way,
otherwise you will bein danger of losing
your life; for they are obstinate, even to
desperation. It is very dangerous to meet
<PB N="314" REF="316"/>
those animals on horseback: they have such
an aversion to horses, that they will attack
them with incredible fury, so as even to tear
them and their riders in pieces; and the best
method for avoiding this fate, is to clap
spurs to your beast, and seek your safety in
flight. I have been more than once obliged
to fly before them. They always give you
warning, by raising a hideous braying as
soon as they perceive the horse at a distance.
The mules of Provence are not so mischie∣vous,
because they are more used to the sight
and society of horses: but those of Pied∣mont
are by far the largest and the strongest
I have seen.</P>
<P>Some very feasible schemes for improving
the commerce of Nice have been presented
to the ministry of Turin; but hitherto with∣out
success. The English import annually
between two and three thousand bales of
raw silk, the growth of Piedmont; and this
is embarked either at Genoa or Leghorn.
We likewise take a considerable quantity of
fruit and oil at Oneglia, St. Remo, and
other places in this neighbourhood. All these
commodities might be embarked at a smaller
<PB N="315" REF="317"/>
expence at Nice, which is a free port, where
no duties are paid by the exporter. Besides,
the county of Nice itself produces a conside∣rable
quantity of hemp, oranges, lemons,
and very good oil and anchovies, with some
silk and wine, which last is better than that of
Languedoc, and far excels the port drank in
England. This wine is of a strong body, a
good flavour, keeps very well, and improves
by sea-carriage. I am told, that some of the
wine-merchants here transport French wine
from Languedoc and Provence, and enter it
in England as the produce of Nice or Italy.
If the merchants of Nice would establish
magazines of raw silk, oil, wine, &amp;c. at
Nice; and their correspondents at London
send hither ships at stated periods, laden
with India goods, hard-ware, and other
manufactures of England, which would find
a vent in this country, in Piedmont, Savoy,
Swisserland, and Provence, then the com∣merce
of this town would flourish, more
especially if the king would lay out the ne∣cessary
expence for rendering the harbour
more commodious and secure. But this is
not a matter of very great consequence, as
<PB N="316" REF="318"/>
there is an excellent harbour at Ville Fran∣che,
which is not more than a mile and a
half from that of Nice. But the great ob∣jection
to the improvement of commerce at
Nice, is the want of money, industry, and
character. The natives themselves are in ge∣neral
such dirty knaves, that no foreigners
will trust them in the way of trade. They
have been known to fill their oil-casks half
full of water, and their anchovy-barrels with
stinking heads of that fish, in order to cheat
their correspondents.</P>
<P>The shopkeepers of this place are generally
poor, greedy, and over-reaching. Many of
them are bankrupts of Marseilles, Genoa,
and other countries, who have fled from
their creditors to Nice; which, being a free∣port,
affords an asylum to foreign cheats and
sharpers of every denomination. Here is like∣wise
a pretty considerable number of Jews,
who live together in a street appropriated
for their use, which is shut up every night.
They act as brokers; but are generally poor,
and deal in frippery, remnants, old cloaths,
and old houshold furniture. There is ano∣ther
branch of traffick engrossed by the
<PB N="317" REF="319"/>
monks. Some convents have such a number
of masses bequeathed to them, that they find
it impossible to execute the will of the donors.
In this case, they agree by the lump with the
friars of poorer convents, who say the masses
for less money than has been allowed by the
defunct, and their employers pocket the dif∣ference:
for example; my grandfather be∣queaths
a sum of money to a certain con∣vent,
to have such a number of masses said
for the repose of his soul, at the price of
ten sols each; and this convent, not having
time to perform them, bargains with the fri∣ars
of another to say them for six sols a-piece,
so that they gain four sols upon every mass;
for it matters not to the soul of the deceased
where they are said, so they be properly au∣thenticated.
A poor gentleman of Nice,
who piques himself much on the noble blood
that runs in his veins, though he has not a
pair of whole breeches to wear, complained
to me, that his great grandmother had foun∣ded
a perpetual mass for the repose of her
own soul, at the rate of fifteen sols (nine-pence
English) a day; which indeed was all
that now remained of the family estate. He
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
said, what made the hardship the greater on
him, she had been dead above fifty years,
and in all probability her soul had got out
of purgatory long ago; therefore the con∣tinuance
of the mass was an unnecessary ex∣pence.
I told him, I thought in such a case,
the defunct should appear before the civil
magistrate, and make affidavit of her being
at peace, for the advantage of the family.
He mused a little, and shrugging up his
shoulders, replied, that where the interest
of the church was at stake, he did not be∣lieve
a spirit's declaration would be held legal
evidence. In some parts of France, the curé
of the parish, on All Soul's day, which is
called <HI>le jour des morts,</HI> says a <HI>libera domine</HI>
for two sols, at every grave in the burying-ground,
for the release of the soul whose
body is there interred.</P>
<P>The artisans of Nice are very lazy, very
needy, very aukward, and void of all inge∣nuity.
The price of their labour is very
near as high as at London or Paris. Rather
than work for moderate profit, arising from
constant employment, which would comfort∣ably
maintain them and their families, they
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
choose to starve at home, to lounge about
the ramparts, bask themselves in the sun, or
play at bowls in the streets from morning
'till night.</P>
<P>The lowest class of people consists of
fishermen, day labourers, porters, and pea∣sants:
these last are distributed chiefly in the
small cassines in the neighbourhood of the
city, and are said to amount to twelve thou∣sand.
They are employed in labouring the
ground, and have all the outward signs of
extreme misery. They are all diminutive,
meagre, withered, dirty, and half naked;
in their complexions, not barely swarthy,
but as black as Moors; and I believe, in my
conscience, many of them are descendants
of that people. They are very hard favoured;
and their women in general have the coarsest
features I have ever seen: it must be owned,
however, they have the finest teeth in the
world. The nourishment of those poor crea∣tures
consists of the refuse of the garden,
very coarse bread, a kind of meal called
polenta, made of Indian corn, which is
very nourishing and agreeable, and a little
oil: but even in these particulars, they seem
<PB N="318" REF="322"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="319" REF="323"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="320" REF="324"/>
to be stinted to very scanty meals. I have
known a peasant feed his family with the
skins of boiled beans. Their hogs are much
better fed than their children. 'Tis pity they
have no cows, which would yield milk, but∣ter,
and cheese, for the sustenance of their
families. With all this wretchedness, one of
these peasants will not work in your garden
for less than eighteen sols, about eleven-pence
sterling, <HI>per diem;</HI> and then he does not half
the work of an English labourer. If there
is fruit in it, or any thing he can convey,
he will infallibly steal it, if you do not keep
a very watchful eye over him. All the com∣mon
people are thieves and beggars; and I
believe this is always the case with people
who are extremely indigent and miserable.
In other respects, they are seldom guilty of
excesses. They are remarkably respectful and
submissive to their superiors. The populace
of Nice are very quiet and orderly. They
are little addicted to drunkenness. I have
never heard of one riot since I lived among
them; and murder and robbery are alto∣gether
unknown. A man may walk alone
over the county of Nice, at midnight, with∣out
<PB N="321" REF="325"/>
danger of insult. The police is very
well regulated. No man is permitted to
wear a pistol or dagger, on pain of being
sent to the gallies. I am informed, that
both murder and robbery are very frequent
in some parts of Piedmont. Even here,
when the peasants quarrel in their cups,
(which very seldom happens) they draw
their knives, and the one infallibly stabs the
other. To such extremities, however, they
never proceed, except when there is a wo∣man
in the case; and mutual jealousy co∣operates
with the liquor they have drank,
to inflame their passions. In Nice, the com∣mon
people retire to their lodgings at eight
o'clock in winter, and nine in summer.
Every person found in the streets after these
hours, is apprehended by the patrole; and,
if he cannot give a good account of himself,
sent to prison. At nine in winter, and ten
in summer, there is a curfew-bell rung,
warning the people to put out their lights▪
and go to bed. This is a very necessary
precaution in towns subject to conflagrations;
but of small use in Nice, where there is very
little combustible in the houses.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="326"/>
The punishments inflicted upon malefac∣tors
and delinquents at Nice are hanging
for capital crimes; slavery on board the gal∣lies
for a limited term, or for life, according
to the nature of the transgression; flagella∣tion,
and the strappado. This last is per∣formed,
by hoisting up the criminal by his
hands tied behind his back, on a pulley
about two stories high; from whence, the
rope being suddenly slackened, he falls to
within a yard or two of the ground, where
he is stopped with a violent shock, arising
from the weight of his body, and the velo∣city
of his descent, which generally dislocates
his shoulders, with incredible pain. This
dreadful execution is sometimes repeated in a
few minutes on the same delinquent; so that
the very ligaments are tore from his joints,
and his arms are rendered useless for life.</P>
<P>The poverty of the people in this country,
as well as in the South of France, may be
conjectured from the appearance of their do∣mestic
animals. The draught-horses, mules,
and asses, of the peasants, are so meagre,
as to excite compassion. There is not a dog
to be seen in tolerable case; and the cats
<PB N="323" REF="327"/>
are so many emblems of famine, frightfully
thin, and dangerously rapacious. I wonder
the dogs and they do not devour young
children. Another proof of that indigence
which reigns among the common people, is
this: you may pass through the whole
South of France, as well as the county of
Nice, where there is no want of groves,
woods, and plantations, without hearing the
song of black-bird, thrush, linnet, gold-finch,
or any other bird whatsoever. All is
silent and solitary. The poor birds are de∣stroyed,
or driven for refuge, into other
countries, by the savage persecution of the
people, who spare no pains to kill, and catch
them for their own subsistence. Scarce a
sparrow, red-breast, tom-tit, or wren, can
'scape the guns and snares of those indefati∣gable
fowlers. Even the noblesse make par∣ties
to go <HI>à la chasse;</HI> that is, to kill those
little birds, which they eat as <HI>gibier.</HI></P>
<P>The great poverty of the people here, is
owing to their religion. Half of their time
is lost in observing the great number of festi∣vals;
and half of their substance is given to
mendicant friars and parish priests. But if
<PB N="324" REF="328"/>
the church occasions their indigence, it like∣wise,
in some measure, alleviates the horrors
of it, by amusing them with shows, pro∣cessions,
and even those very feasts, which
afford a recess from labour, in a country
where the climate disposes them to idleness.
If the peasants in the neighbourhood of any
chapel dedicated to a saint, whose day is to
be celebrated, have a mind to make a <HI>festin,</HI>
in other words, a fair, they apply to the
commandant of Nice for a licence, which
costs them about a French crown. This
being obtained, they assemble after service,
men and women, in their best apparel, and
dance to the musick of fiddles, and pipe and
tabor, or rather pipe and drum. There are
hucksters stands, with pedlary ware and
knick-knacks for presents; cakes and bread,
<HI>liqueurs</HI> and wine; and thither generally re∣sort
all the company of Nice. I have seen
our whole noblesse at one of these <HI>festins,</HI>
kept on the highway in summer, mingled
with an immense crowd of peasants, mules,
and asses, covered with dust, and sweating
at every pore with the excessive heat of the
weather. I should be much puzzled to tell
<PB N="325" REF="329"/>
whence their enjoyment arises on such occa∣sions;
or to explain their motives for going
thither, unless they are prescribed it for pen∣nance,
as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore-taste of purgatory.</P>
<P>Now I am speaking of religious institu∣tions,
I cannot help observing, that the an∣tient
Romans were still more superstitious
than the modern Italians; and that the
number of their religious feasts, sacrifices,
fasts, and holidays, was even greater than
those of the Christian church of Rome.
They had their <HI>festi</HI> and <HI>profesti;</HI> their <HI>feriae
stativae,</HI> and <HI>conceptivae,</HI> their fixed and
moveable feasts; their <HI>esuriales,</HI> or fasting
days, and their <HI>precidaneae,</HI> or vigils. The
<HI>agonales</HI> were celebrated in January; the <HI>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mentales,</HI>
in January and February; the <HI>lu∣percales</HI>
and <HI>matronales,</HI> in March; the <HI>flo∣ralia,</HI>
in May; the <HI>saturnalia, robigalia,
venalia, vertumnalia, fornacalia, palilia,</HI> and
<HI>laralia.</HI> They had their <HI>latinae,</HI> their <HI>pa∣ganales,</HI>
their <HI>sementinae,</HI> their <HI>compitales,</HI>
and their <HI>imperativae;</HI> such as the <HI>novemda∣lia,</HI>
instituted by the senate, on account of
a supposed shower of stones. Besides, eve∣ry
private family had a number of <HI>feriae,</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="330"/>
kept either by way of rejoicing for some bene∣fit,
or mourning for some calamity. Every
time it thundered, the day was kept holy.
Every ninth day was a holiday, thence called
<HI>nundinae quasi novendinae.</HI> There was the
<HI>dies denominalis,</HI> which was the fourth of
the kalends; nones and ides of every month,
over and above the anniversary of every
great defeat which the republic had sustained,
particularly the <HI>dies alliensis,</HI> or fifteenth of
the kalends of December, on which the
Romans were totally defeated by the Gauls
and Veientes; as Lucan says—<HI>et damnata
diu Romanis allia fastis.</HI> The vast variety of
their deities, said to amount to thirty thou∣sand,
with their respective rites of adoration,
could not fail to introduce such a number of
ceremonies, shews, sacrifices, lustrations, and
public processions, as must have employed
the people almost constantly from one end of
the year to the other. This continual dissi∣pation
must have been a great enemy to in∣dustry;
and the people must have been idle
and effeminate. I think it would be no dif∣ficult
matter to prove, that there is very little
difference, in point of character, between the
<PB N="327" REF="331"/>
antient and modern inhabitants of Rome;
and that the great figure which this empire
made of old, was not so much owing to the
intrinsic virtue of its citizens, as to the bar∣barism,
ignorance, and imbecility of the na∣tions
they subdued. Instances of public and
private virtue I find as frequent and as
striking in the history of other nations, as in
the annals of antient Rome; and now that
the kingdoms and states of Europe are pretty
equally enlightened, and ballanced in the
scale of political power, I am of opinion,
that if the most fortunate generals of the
Roman commonwealth were again placed at
the head of the very armies they once com∣manded,
instead of extending their conquests
over all Europe and Asia, they would hardly
be able to subdue, and retain under their
dominion, all the petty republics that subsist
in Italy.</P>

<P>IN my enquiries about the revenues of
Nice, I am obliged to trust to the infor∣mation
of the inhabitants, who are much
given to exaggerate. They tell me, the reve∣nues
of this town amount to one hundred
thousand livres, or five thousand pounds
sterling; of which I would strike off at least
one fourth, as an addition of their own va∣nity:
perhaps, if we deduct a third, it will
be nearer the truth. For, I cannot find out
any other funds they have, but the butchery
and the bakery, which they farm at so much
a year to the best bidder; and the <HI>droits
d'entrée,</HI> or duties upon provision brought in∣to
the city; but these are very small. The
king is said to draw from Nice one hundred
thousand livres annually, arising from a free-gift,
amounting to seven hundred pounds
<PB N="329" REF="333"/>
sterling, in lieu of the taille, from which this
town and country are exempted; an inconsi∣derable
duty upon wine sold in public-houses;
and the <HI>droits du port.</HI> These last consist of
anchorage, paid by all vessels in proportion
to their tonnage, when they enter the har∣bours
of Nice and Villa Franca. Besides,
all foreign vessels, under a certain stipulated
burthen, that pass between the island of
Sardinia and this coast, are obliged, in going
to the eastward, to enter and pay a certain
regulated imposition, on pain of being ta∣ken
and made prize. The prince of Monaco
exacts a talliage of the same kind; and both
he and the king of Sardinia maintain armed
cruisers to assert this prerogative; from
which, however, the English and French are
exempted by treaty, in consequence of ha∣ving
paid a sum of money at once. In all
probability, it was originally given as a con∣sideration
for maintaining lights on the
shore, for the benefit of navigators, like the
toll paid for passing the Sound in the Baltic.
The fanal, or lanthorn, to the eastward of
Villa Franca, is kept in good repair, and still
lighted in the winter. The toll, however,
<PB N="330" REF="334"/>
is a very troublesome tax upon seluccas, and
other small craft, which are greatly retarded
in their voyages, and often lose the benefit of
a fair wind, by being obliged to run in shore,
and enter those harbours. The tobacco,
which is mostly from the Levant, the king
manufactures at his own expence, and sells
for his own profit, at a very high price; and
every person convicted of selling this commo∣dity
in secret, is sent to the gallies for life.
The salt comes chiefly from Sardinia, and is
stored up in the king's magazine; from
whence it is exported to Piedmont, and other
parts of his inland dominions. And here it
may not be amiss to observe, that Sardinia
produces very good horses, well-shaped,
though small; strong, hardy, full of mettle,
and easily fed. The whole county of Nice
is said to yield the king half a million of
livres, about twenty-five thousand pounds
sterling, arising from a small donative made
by every town and village: for the lands pay
no tax, or imposition, but the tithes to the
church. His revenue then flows from the
<HI>gabelle</HI> on salt and wine, and these free-gifts;
so that we may strike off one fifth of the sum
<PB N="331" REF="335"/>
at which the whole is estimated; and con∣clude,
that the king draws from the county
of Nice, about four hundred thousand livres,
or twenty thousand pounds sterling. That
his revenues from Nice are not great, appears
from the smallness of the appointments al∣lowed
to his officers. The president has about
three hundred pounds per annum; and the
intendant about two. The pay of the com∣mandant
does not exceed three hundred and
fifty pounds: but he has certain privileges
called the <HI>tour du baton,</HI> some of which a man
of spirit would not insist upon. He who
commands at present, having no estate of
his own, enjoys a small commandery, which
being added to his appointments at Nice,
make the whole amount to about five hun∣dred
pounds sterling.</P>
<P>If we may believe the politicians of Nice,
the king of Sardinia's whole revenue does
not fall short of twenty millions of Pied∣montese
livres, being about one million of
our money. It must be owned, that there
is no country in Christendom less taxed than
that of Nice; and as the soil produces the
necessaries of life, the inhabitants, with a
<PB N="332" REF="336"/>
little industry, might renew the golden age
in this happy climate, among their groves,
woods, and mountains, beautified with foun∣tains,
brooks, rivers, torrents, and cascades.
In the midst of these pastoral advantages,
the peasants are poor and miserable. They
have no stock to begin the world with.
They have no leases of the lands they culti∣vate;
but entirely depend, from year to year,
on the pleasure of the arbitrary landholder,
who may turn them out at a minute's warn∣ing;
and they are oppressed by the mendi∣cant
friars and parish priests, who rob them
of the best fruits of their labour: after all,
the ground is too scanty for the number of
families which are crouded on it.</P>
<P>You desire to know the state of the arts
and sciences at Nice; which, indeed, is al∣most
a total blank. I know not what men of
talents this place may have formerly produ∣ced;
but at present, it seems to be consecrated
to the reign of dulness and superstition. It
is very surprising, to see a people established
between two enlightened nations, so devoid
of taste and literature. Here are no tolera∣ble
pictures, busts, statues, nor edifices: the
<PB N="333" REF="337"/>
very ornaments of the churches are wretch∣edly
conceived, and worse executed. They
have no public, nor private libraries, that
afford any thing worth perusing. There is
not even a bookseller in Nice. Though they
value themselves upon their being natives of
Italy, they are unacquainted with music. The
few that play upon instruments, attend only
to the execution. They have no genius nor
taste, nor any knowledge of harmony and
composition. Among the French, a Nissard
piques himself on being Provençal; but in
Florence, Milan, or Rome, he claims the
honour of being born a native of Italy.
The people of condition here speak both
languages equally well; or, rather, equally
ill; for they use a low, uncouth phraseology;
and their pronunciation is extremely vitious.
Their vernacular tongue is what they call
<HI>Patois;</HI> though in so calling it, they do it in∣justice.
—<HI>Patois,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>pata∣vinitas,</HI>
means no more than a provincial
accent, or dialect. It takes its name from
<HI>Patavium,</HI> or Padua, which was the birth-place
of Livy, who, with all his merit as a
writer, has admitted into his history, some
<PB N="334" REF="338"/>
provincial expressions of his own country.
The <HI>Patois,</HI> or native tongue of Nice, is no
other than the ancient Provençal, from
which the Italian, Spanish, and French lan∣guages,
have been formed. This is the lan∣guage
that rose upon the ruins of the Latin
tongue, after the irruptions of the Goths,
Vandals, Huns, and Burgundians, by whom
the Roman empire was destroyed. It was
spoke all over Italy, Spain, and the southern
parts of France, until the thirteenth century,
when the Italians began to polish it into the
language which they now call their own.
The Spaniards and French, likewise, im∣proved
it into their respective tongues. From
its great affinity to the Latin, it was called
<HI>Romance,</HI> a name which the Spaniards still
give to their own language. As the first le∣gends
of knight-errantry were written in Pro∣vençal,
all subsequent performances of the
same kind, have derived from it the name of
romance; and as those annals of chivalry
contained extravagant adventures of knights,
giants, and necromancers, every improbable
story or fiction is to this day called a romance.
Mr. Walpole, in his Catalogue of royal and
<PB N="335" REF="339"/>
noble Authors, has produced two sonnets in
the antient Provençal, written by our king
Richard I. surnamed <HI>Caeur de Lion;</HI> and
Voltaire, in his Historical Tracts, has fa∣voured
the world with some specimens of
the same language. The <HI>Patois</HI> of Nice,
must, without doubt, have undergone chan∣ges
and corruptions in the course of so ma∣ny
ages, especially as no pains have been
taken to preserve its original purity, either
in orthography or pronunciation. It is ne∣glected,
as the language of the vulgar; and
scarce any-body here knows either its origin
or constitution. I have in vain endeavoured
to procure some pieces in the antient Pro∣vençal,
that I might compare them with the
modern <HI>Patois:</HI> but I can find no person to
give me the least information on the subject.
The shades of ignorance, sloth, and stupi∣dity,
are impenetrable. Almost every word
of the <HI>Patois</HI> may still be found in the Ita∣lian,
Spanish, and French languages, with
a small change in the pronunciation. <HI>Cavallo,</HI>
signifying a <HI>horse</HI> in Italian and Spanish, is
called <HI>cavao; maison,</HI> the French word for a
<HI>house</HI> is changed into <HI>maion; agua,</HI> which
<PB N="336" REF="340"/>
means <HI>water</HI> in Spanish, the Nissards call <HI>dai∣gua.</HI>
To express, <HI>what a stop is here!</HI> they say
<HI>acco fa lac aqui,</HI> which is a sentence com∣posed
of two Italian words, one French,
and one Spanish. This is nearly the pro∣portion
in which these three languages will
be found mingled in the <HI>Patois</HI> of Nice;
which, with some variation, extends over all
Provence, Languedoc, and Gascony. I will
now treat you with two or three stanzas of
a <HI>canzon,</HI> or hymn, in this language, to the
Virgin Mary, which was lately printed at
Nice.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>November 10, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had once thoughts of writing a complete
natural history of this town and county:
but I found myself altogether unequal to the
task. I have neither health, strength, nor
opportunity, to make proper collections of
the mineral, vegetable, and animal produc∣tions.
I am not much conversant with these
branches of natural philosophy. I have no
books to direct my inquiries. I can find no
person capable of giving me the least infor∣mation
or assistance; and I am strangely puz∣zled
by the barbarous names they give to
many different species, the descriptions of
which I have read under other appellations;
and which, as I have never seen them be∣fore,
I cannot pretend to distinguish by the
eye. You must therefore be contended with
such imperfect intelligence as my opportuni∣ties
can afford.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="343"/>
The useful arts practised at Nice, are these,
gardening and agriculture, with their conse∣quences,
the making of wine, oil, and cor∣dage;
the rearing of silk-worms, with the
subsequent management and manufacture of
that production; and the fishing, which I
have already described.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more unpromising than the
natural soil of this territory, except in a very
few narrow bottoms, where there is a stiff
clay, which when carefully watered, yields
tolerable pasturage. In every other part, the
soil consists of a light sand mingled with peb∣bles,
which serves well enough for the cul∣ture
of vines and olives: but the ground
laid out for kitchen herbs, as well as for
other fruit, must be manured with great care
and attention. They have no black cattle to
afford such compost as our farmers use in
England. The dung of mules and asses,
which are their only beasts of burthen, is of
very little value for this purpose; and the
natural sterility of their ground requires
something highly impregnated with nitre and
volatile salts. They have recourse therefore
to pigeon's dung and ordure, which fully
<PB N="340" REF="344"/>
answer their expectations. Every peasant
opens, at one corner of his wall, a public
house of office for the reception of passen∣gers;
and in the town of Nice, every tene∣ment
is provided with one of these receptacles,
the contents of which are carefully preserved
for sale. The peasant comes with his asses
and casks to carry it off before day, and pays
for it according to its quality, which he exa∣mines
and investigates, by the taste and fla∣vour.
The jakes of a protestant family, who
eat <HI>gras</HI> every day, bears a much higher price
than the privy of a good catholic who lives
<HI>maigre</HI> one half of the year. The vaults be∣longing
to the convent of Minims are not
worth emptying.</P>
<P>The ground here is not del<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with spades
as in England, but laboured with a broad,
sharp hough, with a short horizontal handle;
and the climate is so hot and dry in the sum∣mer,
that the plants must be watered every
morning and evening, especially where it is
not shaded by trees. It is surprising to see
how the productions of the earth are crouded
together. One would imagine they would
rob one another of nourishment; and more∣over
<PB N="341" REF="345"/>
be stifled for want of air; and doubt∣less
this is the case. Olive and other fruit-trees
are planted in rows very close to each
other. These are connected by vines, and
the interstices, between the rows, are filled
with corn. The gardens that supply the
town with sallad and pot-herbs, lye all on
the side of Provence, by the highway. They
are surrounded with high stone-walls, or
ditches, planted with a kind of cane or large
reed, which answers many purposes in this
country. The leaves of it afford sustenance
to the asses, and the canes not only serve as
fences to the inclosures; but are used to prop
the vines and pease: they are formed into ar∣bours,
and wore as walking-staves. All these
gardens are watered by little rills that come
from the mountains, particularly, by the small
branches of the two sources which I have de∣scribed
in a former letter, as issuing from the
two sides of a mountain, under the names of
<HI>Fontaine de Muraille,</HI> and <HI>Fontaine du Temple.</HI></P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Nice, they raise
a considerable quantity of hemp, the largest
and strongest I ever saw. Part of this, when
dressed, is exported to other countries; and
<PB N="342" REF="346"/>
part is manufactured into cordage. How∣ever
profitable it may be to the grower, it is
certainly a great nusance in the summer.
When taken out of the pits, where it has
been put to rot, the strench it raises is quite
insupportable; and must undoubtedly be un∣wholesome.</P>
<P>There is such a want of land in this neigh∣bourhood,
that terraces are built over one
another with loose stones, on the faces of
bare rocks, and these being covered with
earth and manured, are planted with olives,
vines, and corn. The same shift was prac∣tised
all over Palestine, which was rocky and
barren, and much more populous than the
country of Nice.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the small extent of this
territory, there are some pleasant meadows in
the skirts of Nice, that produce excellent
clover; and the corn which is sown in open
fields, where it has the full benefit of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oil, sun, and air, grows to a surprizing
height. I have seen rye seven or eight feet
high. All vegetables have a wonderful growth
in this climate. Besides wheat, rye, barley,
and oats, this country produces a good deal
<PB N="343" REF="347"/>
of Meliga, or Turkish wheat, which is what
we call Indian corn. I have, in a former let∣ter,
observed that the meal of this grain goes
by the name <HI>polenta,</HI> and makes excellent
hasty-pudding, being very nourishing, and
counted an admirable pectoral. The pods
and stalks are used for fuel; and the leaves
are much preferable to common straw, for
making <HI>paillasses.</HI></P>
<P>The pease and beans in the garden appear
in the winter like beautiful plantations of
young trees in blossom; and perfume the air.
Myrtle, sweet-briar, sweet-marjoram, sage,
thyme, lavender, rosemary, with many other
aromatic herbs and flowers, which with us
require the most careful cultivation, are here
found wild in the mountains.</P>
<P>It is not many years since the Nissards
learned the culture of silk-worms, of their
neighbours the Piedmonteze; and hitherto
the progress they have made is not very con∣siderable:
the whole county of Nice pro∣duces
about one hundred and thirty-three
bales of three hundred pounds each, amount∣ing
in value to four hundred thousand livres.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="348"/>
In the beginning of April, when the mul∣berry-leaves
begin to put forth, the eggs or
grains that produce the silk-worm, are hatch∣ed.
The grains are washed in wine, and
those that swim on the top, are thrown a∣way
as good for nothing. The rest being
deposited in small bags of linen, are worn
by women in their bosoms, until the worms
begin to appear: then they are placed in
shallow wooden boxes, covered with a piece
of white paper, cut into little holes, through
which the worms ascend as they are hatched,
to feed on the young mulberry-leaves, of
which there is a layer above the paper.
These boxes are kept for warmth between two
mattrasses, and visited every day. Fresh
leaves are laid in, and the worms that feed
are removed successively to the other place pre∣pared
for their reception. This is an habi∣tation,
consisting of two or three stories, about
twenty inches from each other, raised upon
four wooden posts. The floors are made of
canes, and strewed with fresh mulberry-leaves:
the corner posts, and other occasional props,
for sustaining the different floors, are covered
with a coat of loose heath, which is twisted
<PB N="345" REF="349"/>
round the wood. The worms when hatched
are laid upon the floors; and here you may
see them in all the different stages of moult∣ing
or casting the slough, a change which
they undergo three times successively before
they begin to work. The silk-worm is an
animal of such acute and delicate sensations,
that too much care cannot be taken to keep
its habitation clean, and to refresh it from
time to time with pure air. I have seen
them languish and die in scores, in conse∣quence
of an accidental bad smell. The
soiled leaves, and the filth which they neces∣sarily
produce, should be carefully shifted
every day; and it would not be amiss to
purify the air sometimes with fumes of vine∣gar,
rose, or orange-flower water. These
niceties, however, are but little observed.
They commonly lie in heaps as thick as
shrimps in a plate, some feeding on the
leaves, some new hatched, some intranced in
the agonies of casting their skin, some lan∣guishing,
and some actually dead, with a lit∣ter
of half eaten faded leaves about them, in
a close room, crouded with women and chil∣dren,
not at all remarkable for their cleanli∣ness.
<PB N="346" REF="350"/>
I am assured by some persons of credit,
that if they are touched, or even approached,
by a woman in her catamenia, they infallibly
expire. This, however, must be understood
of those females whose skins have naturally a
very rank flavour, which is generally height∣ened
at such periods. The mulberry-leaves
used in this country are of the tree which
bears a small white fruit not larger than a
damascene. They are planted on purpose,
and the leaves are sold at so much a pound.
By the middle of June all the mulberry-trees
are stripped; but new leaves succeed, and in
a few weeks, they are cloathed again with
fresh verdure. In about ten days after the
last moulting, the silk-worm climbs upon the
props of his house, and choosing a situation
among the heath, begins to spin in a most
curious manner, until he is quite inclosed,
and the cocon or pod of silk, about the size
of a pigeon's egg, which he has produced,
remains suspended by several filaments. It is
not unusual to see double cocons, spun by
two worms included under a common cover.
There must be an infinite number of worms
to yield any considerable quantity of silk.
<PB N="347" REF="351"/>
One ounce of eggs or grains produces four
rup, or one hundred Nice pounds of cocons;
and one rup, or twenty-five pounds of cocons,
if they are rich, gives three pounds of raw
silk; that is, twelve pounds of silk are got
from one ounce of grains, which ounce of
grains is produced by as many worms as are
inclosed in one pound, or twelve ounces of
cocons. In preserving the cocons for breed,
you must choose an equal number of males
and females; and these are very easily distin∣guished
by the shape of the cocons; that
which contains the male is sharp, and the
other obtuse, at the two ends. In ten or
twelve days after the cocon is finished, the
worm makes its way through it, in the form
of a very ugly, unwieldy, aukward butter∣fly,
and as the different sexes are placed by
one another on paper or linen, they imme∣diately
engender. The female lays her eggs,
which are carefully preserved; but neither
she nor her mate takes any nourishment, and
in eight or ten days after they quit the cocons,
they generally die. The silk of these cocons
cannot be wound, because the animals in
piercing through them, have destroyed the
<PB N="348" REF="352"/>
continuity of the filaments. It is therefore,
first boiled, and then picked and carded like
wool, and being afterwards spun, is used in
the coarser stuffs of the silk manufacture.
The other cocons, which yield the best silk,
are managed in a different manner. Before
the inclosed worm has time to penetrate, the
silk is reeled off with equal care and inge∣nuity.
A handful of the cocons are thrown
into a kettle of boiling water, which not only
kills the animal, but dissolves the glutinous
substance by which the fine filaments of the
silk cohere or stick together, so that they are
easily wound off, without breaking. Six or
seven of these small filaments being joined to∣gether
are passed over a kind of twisting iron,
and fixed to the wheel, which one girl turns,
while another, with her hands in the boiling
water, disentangles the threads, joins them
when they chance to break, and supplies fresh
cocons with admirable dexterity and dispatch.
There is a manufacture of this kind just with∣out
one of the gates of Nice, where forty or
fifty of these wheels are worked together, and
give employment for some weeks to double the
number of young women. Those who ma∣nage
<PB N="349" REF="353"/>
the pods that float in the boiling water
must be very alert, otherwise they will scald
their fingers. The smell that comes from the
boiling cocons is extremely offensive. Hard
by the harbour, there is a very curious mill
for twisting the silk, which goes by water.
There is in the town of Nice, a well regu∣lated
hospital for poor orphans of both sexes,
where above one hundred of them are em∣ployed
in dressing, dying, spinning and weav∣ing
the silk. In the villages of Provence, you
see the poor women in the streets spinning
raw silk upon distaves: but here the same
instrument is only used for spinning hemp
and flax; which last, however, is not of the
growth of Nice.—But lest I should spin this
letter to a tedious length, I will now wind
up my bottom, and bid you heartily fare∣well.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>December 19, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN may last, I gave you a succinct account
of the silk-worm, and the management
of that curious insect in this country. I shall
now proceed to describe the methods of mak∣ing
wine and oil.</P>
<P>The vintage begins in September. The
grapes being chosen and carefully picked, are
put into a large vat, where they are pressed
by a man's naked feet, and the juices drawn
off by a cock below. When no more is pro∣cured
by this operation, the bruised grapes
are put into the press, and yield still more
liquor. The juice obtained by this double
pressure, being put in casks, with their bungs
open, begins to ferment and discharge its
impurities at the openings. The waste occa∣sioned
by this discharge, is constantly sup∣plied
with fresh wine; so that the casks are
always full. The fermentation continues
<PB N="351" REF="355"/>
for twelve, fifteen, or twenty days, according
to the strength and vigour of the grape. In
about a month, the wine is fit for drinking.
When the grapes are of a bad, meagre kind,
the wine dealers mix the juice with pigeons-dung
or quick-lime, in order to give it a
spirit which nature has denied: but this is a
very mischievous adulteration.</P>
<P>The process for oil-making is equally sim∣ple.
The best olives are those that grow wild;
but the quantity of them is very inconsidera∣ble.
Olives begin to ripen and drop in the
beginning of November: but some remain
on the trees till February, and even till April,
and these are counted the most valuable.
When the olives are gathered, they must be
manufactured immediately, before they fade
and grow wrinkled, otherwise they will pro∣duce
bad oil. They are first of all ground
into a paste by a mill-stone set edge-ways in
a circular stone-trough, and turned by water.
This paste is put into circular cases made of
grass woven, having a round hole at top and
bottom; when filled they resemble in shape
our Cheshire cheeses. A number of these
placed one upon another, are put in a press,
<PB N="352" REF="356"/>
and being squeezed, the oil with all its im∣purities,
runs into a receptacle below fixed
in the ground. From hence it is laded into a
wooden vat, half filled with water. The
sordes or dirt falls to the bottom; the oil
swims a-top; and being skimmed off, is bar∣re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed
up in small oblong casks. What re∣mains
in the vat, is thrown into a large stone
cistern with water, and after being often stirred,
and standing twelve or fourteen days, yields
a coarser oil used for lamps and manufac∣tures.
After these processes, they extract an
oil still more coarse and fetid from the refuse
of the whole. Sometimes, in order to make
the olives grind the more easily into a paste,
and part with more oil, they are mixed with a
little hot water: but the oil thus procured is
apt to grow rancid. The very finest, called
virgin oil, is made chiefly of green olives,
and sold at a very high price, because a great
quantity is required to produce a very little
oil. Even the stuff that is left after all these
operations, consisting of the dried pulp, is
sold for fuel, and used in <HI>brasieres</HI> for warm∣ing
apartments which have no chimney.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="357"/>
I have now specified all the manufactures
of Nice which are worth mentioning. True
it is, there is some coarse paper made in this
neighbourhood; there are also people here
who dress skins and make leather for the use
of the inhabitants: but this business is very
ill performed: the gloves and shoes are gene∣rally
rotten as they come from the hands of
the maker. Carpenter's, joiner's, and black∣smith's
work is very coarsely and clumsily
done. There are no chairs to be had at
Nice, but crazy things made of a few sticks,
with rush bottoms, which are sold for twelve
livres a dozen. Nothing can be more con∣temptible
than the hard-ware made in this
place, such as knives, scissars, and candle-snuffers.
All utensils in brass and copper are
very ill made and finished. The silver-smiths
make nothing but spoons, forks, paultry
rings, and crosses for the necks of the wo∣men.</P>
<P>The houses are built of a ragged stone
dug from the mountains, and the interstices
are filled with rubble; so that the walls would
appear very ugly, if they were not covered
with plaister, which has a good effect. They
<PB N="354" REF="358"/>
generally consist of three stories, and are co∣vered
with tiles. The apartments of the
better sort are large and lofty, the floors
paved with brick, the roofs covered with a
thick coat of stucco, and the walls white-washed.
People of distinction hang their
chambers with damask, striped silk, painted
cloths, tapestry, or printed linnen. All the
doors, as well as the windows, consist of
folding leaves. As there is no wainscot in
the rooms, which are divided by stone parti∣tions
and the floors and cieling are covered
with brick and stucco, fires are of much
less dreadful consequences here than in our
country. Wainscot would afford harbour
for bugs: besides, white walls have a better
effect in this hot climate. The beds com∣monly
used in this place, and all over Italy,
consist of a <HI>paillasse,</HI> with one or two mat∣trasses,
laid upon planks, supported by two
wooden benches. Instead of curtains there
is a <HI>couziniere</HI> or mosquito net, made of a
kind of gauze, that opens and contracts oc∣casionally,
and incloses the place where you
lie: persons of condition, however, have also
<PB N="355" REF="359"/>
bedsteads and curtains; but these last are
never used in the summer.</P>
<P>In these countries, people of all ranks
dine exactly at noon; an this is the time I
seize in winter, for making my daily tour of
the streets and ramparts, which at all other
hours of the day are crowded with men, wo∣men,
children and beasts of burthen. The
rampart is the common road for carriages of
all kinds. I think there are two private
coaches in Nice, besides that of the com∣mandant:
but there are sedan chairs, which
may be had at a reasonable rate. When I
bathed in the summer, I paid thirty sols,
equal to eighteen-pence, for being carried to
and from the bathing place, which was a
mile from my own house. Now I am speak∣ing
of bathing, it may not be amiss to in∣form
you that though there is a fine open
beach, extending several miles to the west∣ward
of Nice, those who cannot swim ought
to bathe with great precaution, as the sea is
very deep, and the descent very abrupt from
within a yard or two of the water's edge.
The people here were much surprised when I
began to bathe in the beginning of May.
<PB N="356" REF="360"/>
They thought it very strange, that a man
seemingly consumptive should plunge into
the sea, especially when the weather was so
cold; and some of the doctors prognosticated
immediate death. But, when it was perceived
that I grew better in consequence of the bath,
some of the Swiss officers tried the same ex∣periment,
and in a few days, our example
was followed by several inhabitants of Nice.
There is, however, no convenience for this
operation, from the benefit of which the fair
sex must be intirely excluded, unless they lay
aside all regard to decorum; for the shore is
always lined with fishing-boats, and crouded
with people. If a lady should be at the ex∣pence
of having a tent pitched on the beach
where she might put on and off her bathing-dress,
she could not pretend to go into the sea
without proper attendants; nor could she
possibly plunge headlong into the water,
which is the most effectual, and least dan∣gerous
way of bathing. All that she can do
is to have the sea-water brought into her
house, and make use of a bathing-tub, which
may be made according to her own, or phy∣sician's
direction.</P>

What further I have to say of this climate
and country, you shall have in my next;
and then you will be released from a subject,
which I am afraid has been but too circum∣stantially
handled by,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 4, 1765.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE constitution of this climate may
be pretty well ascertained, from the
inclosed register of the weather, which I kept
with all possible care and attention. From a
perusal of it, you will see that there is less
rain and wind at Nice, than in any other
part of the world that I know; and such is
the serenity of the air, that you see nothing
above your head for several months together,
but a charming blue expanse, without cloud
or speck. Whatever clouds may be formed
<PB N="358" REF="362"/>
by evaporation from the sea, they seldom
or never hover over this small territory; but,
in all probability, are attracted by the moun∣tains
that surround it, and there fall in rain
or snow: as for those that gather from other
quarters, I suppose their progress hitherward
is obstructed by those very Alps which rise
one over another, to an extent of many
leagues. This air being dry, pure, heavy,
and elastic, must be agreeable to the consti∣tution
of those who labour under disorders
arising from weak nerves, obstructed perspi∣ration,
relaxed fibres, a viscidity of lymph,
and a languid circulation. In other respects,
it encourages the scurvy, the atmosphere be∣ing
undoubtedly impregnated with sea-salt.
Ever since my arrival at Nice, I have had a
fcorbutical eruption on my right hand,
which diminishes and increases according to
the state of my health. One day last sum∣mer,
when there was a strong breeze from
the sea, the surface of our bodies was co∣vered
with a salt brine, very perceptible to
the taste; my gums, as well as those of
another person in my family, began to swell,
<PB N="359" REF="363"/>
and grow painful, though this had never
happened before; and I was seized with vio∣lent
pains in the joints of my knees. I was
then at a country-house fronting the sea,
and particularly exposed to the marine air.
The swelling of our gums subsided as the
wind fell: but what was very remarkable,
the scurvy-spot on my hand disappeared, and
did not return for a whole month. It is af∣firmed,
that sea-salt will dissolve and ren∣der
the blood so fluid, that it will exude
through the coats of the vessels. Perhaps
the sea-scurvy is a partial dissolution of it,
by that mineral absorbed from the air by the
lymphatics on the surface of the body, and
by those of the lungs in respiration. Certain
it is, in the last stages of the sea-scurvy, the
blood often bursts from the pores; and this
phaenomenon is imputed to a high degree of
putrefaction: sure enough it is attended with
putrefaction. We know that a certain quan∣tity
of salt is required to preserve the animal
juices from growing putrid: but, how a
greater quantity should produce putrefaction,
I leave to wiser heads to explain. Many peo∣ple
<PB N="360" REF="364"/>
here have scorbutical complaints, though
their teeth are not affected. They are sub∣ject
to eruptions on the skin, putrid gums,
pains in the bones, lassitude, indigestion, and
low spirits; but the reigning distemper is a
<HI>marasmus,</HI> or consumption, which proceeds
gradually, without any pulmonary complaint,
the complexion growing more and more flo∣rid,
'till the very last scene of the tragedy.
This I would impute to the effects of a very
dry, saline atmosphere, upon a thin habit,
in which there is an extraordinary waste by
perspiration. The air is remarkably salt in
this district, because the mountains that hem
it in, prevent its communication with the cir∣cumambient
atmosphere, in which the saline
particles would otherwise be diffused; and
there is no rain, nor dew, to precipitate or
dissolve them. Such an air as I have de∣scribed,
should have no bad effect upon a
moist, phlegmatic constitution, such as mine;
and yet it must be owned, I have been visi∣bly
wasting since I came hither, though this
decay I considered as the progress of the <HI>tabes</HI>
which began in England. But the air of
Nice has had a still more sensible effect upon
<PB N="361" REF="365"/>
Mr. Sch—z, who laboured under nervous
complaints to such a degree, that life was a
burthen to him. He had also a fixed pain in
his breast, for which complaint he had for∣merly
tried the air of Naples, where he resi∣ded
some considerable time, and in a great
measure recovered: but, this returning with
weakness, faintness, low spirits, and entire
loss of appetite, he was advised to come hi∣ther;
and the success of his journey has
greatly exceeded his expectation. Though
the weather has been remarkably bad for this
climate, he has enjoyed perfect health. Since
he arrived at Nice, the pain in his breast va∣nished;
he eats heartily, sleeps well, is in
high spirits, and so strong, that he is never
off his legs in the day-time. He can walk
to the Var, and back again, before dinner;
and he had climbed to the tops of all the
mountains in this neighbourhood. I never
saw before such sudden and happy effects from
the change of air. I must also acknowledge,
that ever since my arrival at Nice, I have
breathed more freely than I had done for some
years, and my spirits have been more alert.
The father of my <HI>oeeonome,</HI> who was a dan∣cing-master,
<PB N="362" REF="366"/>
had been so afflicted with an
asthmatic disorder, that he could not live in
France, Spain, or Italy; but found the air
of Nice so agreeable to his lungs, that he
was enabled to exercise his profession for
above twenty years, and died last spring
turned of seventy. Another advantage I have
reaped from this climate is my being, in a
great measure, delivered from a slow fever
which used to hang about me, and render
life a burthen. Neither am I so apt to catch
cold as I used to be in England and France;
and the colds I do catch are not of the same
continuance and consequence, as those to
which I was formerly subject. The air of
Nice is so dry, that in summer, and even in
winter, (except in wet weather) you may
pass the evening, and indeed the whole
night, <HI>sub Dio,</HI> without feeling the least
dew or moisture; and as for fogs, they are
never seen in this district. In summer, the
air is cooled by a regular sea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>breeze blowing
from the east, like that of the West-Indies.
It begins in the forenoon, and increases with
the heat of the day. It dies away about six
or seven; and immediately after sun-set, is
<PB N="363" REF="367"/>
succeeded by an agreeable land-breeze from
the mountains. The sea-breeze from the
eastward, however, is not so constant here,
as in the West-Indies between the tropicks,
because the sun, which produces it, is not so
powerful. This country lies nearer the re∣gion
of variable winds, and is surrounded
by mountains, capes, and straights, which
often influence the constitution and current
of the air. About the winter solstice, the
people of Nice expect wind and rain, which
generally lasts, with intervals, 'til the begin∣ning
of February: but even during this,
their worst weather, the sun breaks out occa∣sionally,
and you may take the air either
a-foot or on horseback every day; for the
moisture is immediately absorbed by the
earth, which is naturally dry. They like∣wise
lay their account with being visited by
showers of rain and gusts of wind in April.
A week's rain in the middle of August
makes them happy. It not only refreshes
the parched ground, and plumps up the
grapes and other fruit, but it cools the air
and assuages the heats, which then begin to
grow very troublesome; but the rainy season
<PB N="364" REF="368"/>
is about the autumnal equinox, or rather
something later. It continues about twelve
days or a fortnight, and is extremely wel∣come
to the natives of this country. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
rainy season is often delayed 'till the latter
end of November, and sometimes 'till the
month of December; in which case, the rest
of the winter is generally dry. The heavy
rains in this country generally come with a
south-west wind, which was the <HI>creberque
procellis Africus</HI> of the antients. It is here
called <HI>Leb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>he,</HI> a corruption of <HI>Lybicus:</HI> it
generally blows high for a day or two, and
rolls the Mediterranean before it in huge
waves, that often enter the town of Nice.
It likewise drives before it all the clouds
which had been formed above the surface of
the Mediterranean. These being expended
in rain, fair weather naturally ensues. For
this reason, the Nissards observe <HI>le lebeche
raccommode le tems.</HI> During the rains of this
season, however, the winds have been varia∣ble.
From the sixteenth of November, 'till
the fourth of January, we have had two
and twenty days of heavy rain: a very ex∣traordinary
visitation in this country: but
<PB N="365" REF="369"/>
the seasons seem to be more irregular than
formerly, all over Europe. In the month of
July, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermo∣meter,
rose to eighty-four at Rome; the
highest degree at which it was ever known in
that country; and the very next day, the
Sabine mountains were covered with snow.
The same phaenomenon happened on the ele∣venth
of August, and the thirtieth of Sep∣tember.
The consequence of these sudden
variations of weather, was this: putrid fe∣vers
were less frequent than usual; but the
sudden check of perspiration from the cold,
produced colds, inflammatory sore throats,
and the rheumatism. I know instances of
some English valetudinarians, who have
passed the winter at Aix, on the supposition
that there was little or no difference between
that air and the climate of Nice: but this is
a very great mistake, which may be attended
with fatal consequences. Aix is altogether
exposed to the nort<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and north-west winds,
which blow as cold in Provence, as ever I
felt them on the mountains of Scotland:
whereas Nice is entirely screened from these
winds by the Maritime Alps, which form an
<PB N="366" REF="370"/>
amphitheatre, to the land-side, around this
little territory: but another incontestible proof
of the mildness of this climate, is deduced
from the oranges, lemons, citrons, roses,
narcissus's, july-flowers, and jonquils, which
ripen and blow in the middle of winter. I
have described the agreeable side of this cli∣mate;
and now I will point out its inconve∣niences.
In the winter, but especially in the
spring, the sun is so hot, that one can hardly
take exercise of any sort abroad, without be∣ing
thrown into a breathing sweat; and the
wind at this season is so cold and piercing,
that it often produces a mischievous effect on
the pores thus opened. If the heat rarifies
the blood and juices, while the cold air con∣stringes
the fibres, and obstructs the perspi∣ration,
inflammatory disorders must ensue.
Accordingly, the people are then subject to
colds, pleurisies, peripneumonies, and ardent
fevers. An old count advised me to stay
within doors in March, <HI>car alors les humeurs
commencent a se remuer.</HI> During the heats of
summer, some few persons of gross habits
have, in consequence of violent exercise and
excess, been seized with putrid fevers, at∣tended
<PB N="367" REF="371"/>
with exanthemata, erisipelatous, and
miliary eruptions, which commonly prove
fatal: but the people in general are healthy,
even those that take very little exercise: a
strong presumption in favour of the climate!
As to medicine, I know nothing of the prac∣tice
of the Nice physicians. Here are eleven
in all; but four or five make shift to live by
the profession. They receive, by way of see,
ten sols (an English six-pence) a visit, and
this but ill paid; so you may guess whether
they are in a condition to support the dignity
of physic; and whether any man, of a libe∣ral
education, would bury himself at Nice
on such terms. I am acquainted with an
Italian physician settled at Villa Franca, a
very good sort of a man, who practises for a
certain salary, raised by annual contribution
among the better sort of people; and an al∣lowance
from the king, for visiting the sick
belonging to the garrison and the gallies.
The whole may amount to near thirty
pounds.</P>
<P>Among the inconveniences of this climate,
the vermin form no inconsiderable article.
Vipers and snakes are found in the moun∣tains.
<PB N="368" REF="372"/>
Our gardens swarm with lizzards▪
and there are some few scorpions; but as yet
I have seen but one of this species. In sum∣mer,
notwithstanding all the care and pre∣cautions
we can take, we are pestered with
incredible swarms of flies, fleas, and bugs;
but the gnats, or <HI>couzins,</HI> are more intole∣rable
than all the rest. In the day-time, it
is impossible to keep the flies out of your
mouth, nostrils, eyes, and ears. They croud
into your milk, tea, chocolate, soup, wine,
and water: they soil your sugar, contami∣nate
your victuals, and devour your fruit;
they cover and defile your furniture, floors,
cielings, and indeed your whole body. As
soon as candles are lighted, the <HI>couzins</HI> begin
to buz about your ears in myriads, and tor∣ment
you with their stings, so that you have
no rest nor respite 'till you get into bed,
where you are secured by your musquito-net.
This inclosure is very disagreeable in hot
weather; and very inconvenient to those,
who, like me, are subject to a cough and
spitting. It is moreover ineffectual; for
some of those cursed insects insinuate them∣selves
within it, almost every night; and half
<PB N="369" REF="373"/>
a dozen of them are sufficient to disturb you
'till morning. This is a plague that conti∣nues
all the year; but in summer it is into∣lerable.
During this season, likewise, the
moths are so mischievous, that it requires
the utmost care to preserve woollen cloths
from being destroyed. From the month of
May, 'till the beginning of October, the
heat is so violent, that you cannot stir abroad
after six in the morning 'till eight at night,
so that you are entirely deprived of the bene∣fit
of exercise. There is no shaded walk in,
or near the town; and there is neither coach
nor chaise to hire, unless you travel post. In∣deed,
there is no road fit for any wheel carri∣age,
but the common highway to the Var, in
which you are scorched by the reflexion of
the sun from the sand and stones, and at the
same time half stifled with dust. If you ride
out in the cool of the evening, you will have
the disadvantage of returning in the dark.</P>
<P>Among the demerits of Nice, I must also
mention the water which is used in the city.
It is drawn from wells; and for the most part
so hard, that it curdles with soap. There
are many fountains and streams in the neigh∣bourhood,
<PB N="370" REF="374"/>
that afford excellent water, which,
at no great charge, might be conveyed into
the town, so as to form conduits in all the
public streets: but the inhabitants are either
destitute of public spirit, or cannot afford
the expence. I have a draw-well in my
porch, and another in my garden, which
supply tolerable water for culinary uses; but
what we drink, is fetched from a well belong∣ing
to a convent of Dominicans in this neigh∣bourhood.
Our linnen is washed in the river
Paglion; and when that is dry, in the brook
called Limpia, which runs into the harbour.</P>
<P>In mentioning the water of this neigh∣bourhood,
I ought not to omit the baths of
Rocabiliare, a small town among the moun∣tains,
about five and twenty miles from
Nice. There are three sources, each warmer
than the other; the warmest being nearly
equal to the heat of the king's bath at Bath
in Somersetshire, as far as I can judge from
information. I have perused a Latin manu∣script,
which treats of these baths at Rocabi∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,
written by the duke of Savoy's first
physician about sixty years ago. He talks
much of the sulphur and the nit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e which they
<PB N="371" REF="375"/>
contain: but I apprehend their efficacy is
owing to the same volatile vitriolic principle,
which characterises the waters at Bath. They
are attenuating and deobstruent, consequently
of service in disorders arising from a languid
circulation, a viscidity of the juices, a lax
fibre, and obstructed viscera. The road from
hence to Rocabiliare is in some parts very
dangerous, lying along the brink of preci∣pices,
impassable to any other carriage but a
mule. The town itself affords bad lodging
and accommodation, and little or no society.
The waters are at the distance of a mile and
a half from the town: there are no baths
nor shelter, nor any sort of convenience for
those that drink them; and the best part of
their efficacy is lost, unless they are drank at
the fountain-head. If these objections were
in some measure removed, I would advise
valetudinarians, who come hither for the
benefit of this climate, to pass the heats of
summer at Rocabiliare, which being situated
among mountains, enjoys a cool temperate
air all the summer. This would be a salu∣tary
respite from the salt air of Nice, to those
who labour under scorbutical complaints;
<PB N="372" REF="376"/>
and they would return with fresh vigour and
spirits, to pass the winter in this place, where
no severity of weather is known. Last June,
when I found myself so ill at my <HI>cassine,</HI> I
had determined to go to Rocabiliare, and
even to erect a hut at the spring, for my
own convenience. A gentleman of Nice un∣dertook
to procure me a tolerable lodging in
the house of the curé, who was his relation.
He assured me, there was no want of fresh
butter, good poultry, excellent veal, and deli∣cate
trout; and that the articles of living might
be had at Rocabiliare for half the price we
paid at Nice: but finding myself grow better
immediately on my return from the <HI>cassine</HI> to
my own house, I would not put myself to the
trouble and expence of a further removal.</P>
<P>I think I have now communicated all the
particulars relating to Nice, that are worth
knowing; and perhaps many more than you
desired to know: but, in such cases, I would
rather be thought prolix and unentertaining,
than deficient in that regard and attention
with which I am very sincerely,</P>
