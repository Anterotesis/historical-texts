<HEAD TYPE="sub">JOURNEY I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> BEGAN my Travels, where I purpose to end them, viz. at the city of London, and there∣fore my account of the city itself will come last; that is to say, at the latter end of my Southern progress; and as in the course of this journey, I shall have many occasions to call it a Circuit, if not a Circle, so I chose to give it the title of Circuits, in the plural, because I do not pretend to have travel∣led it all in one journey, but in many, and some of them many times over; the better to inform myself of every thing I could find worth taking notice of.</P>
<P>I hope it will appear that I am not the less, but the more capable of giving a full account of things, by how much the more deliberation I have taken in the view of them: and by how much the oftner I have had opportunity to see them.</P>
<P>I set out the 3d of April, 1722, going first Eastward, and took what I think▪ I may very honestly call a Circuit in the very journey of it; for I went down by the coast of the Thames thro' the Marshes or Hundreds, on the South∣side of the County of Essex, till I came to Malden▪ Colchester, and Harwich; thence continuing on the coast of Suf∣folk to Yarmouth; thence round by the edge of the Sea, on the North and West∣side of Norfolk, to Lynn, Wiesbich▪ and the Wash; thence back again on the North-side of Suffolk and Essex, to
<PB REF="4" MS="y"/>
the West, ending it in Middlesex, near the place where I began it; reserving the middle or center of the several coun∣ties to some little excursions, which I made by themselvs.</P>
<P>Passing Bow-Bridge, where the coun∣ty of Essex begins the first observation I made was, That all the villages, which may be called the neighbourhood of the city of London on this, as well as on the other sides thereof, which I shall speak of in their order; I say, all those villages are increased in buildings to a strange degree, within the compass of a∣bout twenty or thirty years past at the most.</P>
<P>The village of Stratford, the first in this county from London, is not only in∣creased, but, I believe, more than dou∣bled in that time; every vacancy filled up with new houses, and two little towns, or hamlets, as they may be call∣ed, on the forest side of the town, en∣tirely new, namely, Mary-land▪Point, and the Gravel-Pits, one facing the road to Woodford, and Epping, and the other facing the road to Illford: And as for the hither part, it is almost joined to Bow, in spite of rivers, canals, marshy grounds, &amp;c. Nor is this increase of building the case only, in this and all other villages round London; but the increase of the value and rent of the houses formerly standing, has, in that compass of years afore-mentioned, advanced to a very great degree, and I may venture to say at least a fifth part; some think a third part above what they were before.</P>
<P>This is indeed most visible, speaking of Stratford in Essex; but it is the same thing in proportion in other villages ad∣jacent, especially on the forest-side; as at Low-Layton, Layton-stone, Waltham∣stow, Woodfo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, Wansted, and the rowns of West-Ham▪ Plaistow, Upton, &amp;c. In all which places, or near them (as the inhabitants say<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) above a thousand new foundations have been erected besides old houses repaired, all since the revolu∣tion: And this is not to be forgotten too, that this increase is, generally speaking, of handsome large houses, from 20l. a year to 60l. very few under 20l. a year, being chiefly for the habitations of the richest citizens, such as either are able to keep two houses, one in the country, and one in the city; or for such citizens as being rich, and having left off trade, live altogether in these neighbouring vil∣lages, for the pleasure and health of the latter part of their days.</P>
<P>The truth of this may at least appear, in that they tell me there are no less than two hundred coaches kept by the inha∣bitants within the circumference of these few villages named above, besides such as are kept by accidental lodgers.</P>
<P>This increase of the inhabitants, and the cause of it, I shall inlarge upon when I come to speak of the like in the counties of Middlesex, Surry, &amp;c Where it is the same, only in a much greater degree: But this I must take notice of here, that this increase causes those vil∣lages to be much pleasanter and more so∣ciable than formerly, for now people go to them, not for retirement into the country, but for good company▪ of which, that I may speak to the ladies as well as other authors do, there are in these villages, nay, in all, three or four excepted, excellent conversation, and a great deal of it, and that without the mixture of assembles, gaming-houses, and publick foundations of vice and de∣bauchery, and particularly, I find none of those incentives kept up on this side the country.</P>
<P>Mr. Camden, and his learned conti∣nuator, bishop Gipson, have ransacked this country for its antiquities▪ and have left little unsearched; and, as it is not my present design to say much of what has been said already▪ I shall touch very lightly where to such excellent antiqua∣ries have gone before me; except it be to add what may have been since dis∣covered, which as to these parts is only this, that there seems to be lately found out, in the bottom of the marshes (ge∣nerally called Hackney-Marsh, and be∣ginning near about the place now called) the Wyck, between Old-Ford and the said Wyck, the remains of a great stone
<PB REF="5"/>
causeway, which, as it is supposed, was the highway, or great road from London in∣to Essex, and the same, which goes now over the great bridge between Bow and Stratford.</P>
<P>That the great road lay this way, and that the great causeway landed again just over the river, where now the Tem∣ple-Mills stand, and passed by Sir Tho. Hickes's house at Ruckolls, all this is not doubted; and that it was one of those famous highways made by the Ro∣mans, there is undoubted proof, by the several marks of Roman work, and by Roman coins, and other antiquities found there some of which are said to be de∣posited in the hands of the Reverend M. Strype, vica▪ of the parish of Low-Layton.</P>
<P>From hence the great road passed up to Layton-stone, a place by some known, now as much, by the sign of the Green-Man, formerly a lodge upon the edge of the Forest; and crossing by Wansted house, formerly the dwelling of Sir Jo∣siah Child, now of his son the lord Castle∣main, (of which, hereafter) went over the same river which we now pass at Ilford; and passing that part of the great Forest which we now call Henault Forest, came into that which is now the great road, a little on this side the Whalebone, a place on the road so called, because a rib-bone of a great Whale, which was taken in the river of Thames the same year that Oliver Cromwell died, 1658, was fixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature, it being at first about eight and-twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot long.</P>
<P>According to my first intention of ef∣fectually viewing the Sea-coast of these three counties, I went from Stratford to Barking, a large market-town, but chief∣ly inhabited by Fishermen, whose Smacks ride in the Thames, at the mouth of their river, from whence their Fish is sent up to London, to the market at Billinsgate, by small boats, of which I shall speak by itself in my description of London.</P>
<P>One thing I cannot omit in the men∣tion of these Barking Fisher-Smacks, viz. That one of those Fishermen, a very sub∣stantial and experienced man, convinced me, that all the pretences to bringing Fish alive to London market from the North Seas, and other remote places on the coast of Great Britain, by the new∣built ships called Fish-Pools, have not been able to do any thing, but what their Fishing-Smacks are able on the same Occasion to perform. These Fish∣ing-Smacks are very useful vessels to the publick upon many occasions; as particu∣larly, in time of war they are used as Press-Smacks running to all the North∣ern and Western coasts to pick up Sea∣men to mann the Navy, when any expe∣dition is at hand that requires a sudden equipment: At other times, being ex∣cellent Sailors, they are tenders to parti∣cular Men of War; and on an expedition they have been made use of as machines, for the blowing up fortified Ports and Havens, as at Calais, St. Maloes, and other places.</P>
<P>This parish of Barking is very large; and by the improvement of lands taken in, out of the Thames, and out of the river which runs by the town, the tithes, as the townsmen assured me, are worth above 600 l. per annum, including small tithes. Note, This parish has two or three chapels of case, viz. One at Ilford, and one on the side of Henault Forest, called New Chapel.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Fanshaw, of an ancient Roman Catholick family, has a very good estate in this parish: A little beyond the town, on the road to Dagenham, stood a great house, ancient, and now almost fallen down, where tradition says, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unpowder Treason Plot was at first con∣triv'd, and that all the first consultations about it were held there.</P>
<P>This side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitants, occasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air; for these low Marsh Grounds, which, with all the South side of the county, have been saved out of the river Thames, and out of the Sea, where the river is wide enough to be call'd so, begin here, or rather begin at West Ham, by Strat∣ford and continue to extend themselves.
<PB REF="6"/>
From hence Eastward, growing wider and wider, till we come beyond Tilbu∣ry, when the slat country lies six, seven, or eight miles broad, and is justly said to be both unhealthy, and unpleasant.</P>
<P>However the lands are rich, and, as is observable, it is very good farming in the Marshes, because the landlords let good pennyworths▪ for it being a place where every body cannot live; those that venture it, will have encourage∣ment, and indeed it is but reasonable they should.</P>
<P>Several little observations I made in this part of the county of Essex.</P>
<P N="1">1. We saw, passing from Barking to Dagenham, the famous Breach, made by an inundation of the Thames, which was so great, as that it laid near 5000 acres of land under water, but which after near 10 years lying under water, and being several times blown up, has been at last effectually stopped, by the application of captain Perry; the gen∣tleman, who for several years had been employed, in the Czar of Muscovy's works, at Veronitza, on the river Don This Breach appeared now effectually made up, and they assured us, that the new work, where the Breach was, is by much esteemed the strongest of all the sea walls in that level.</P>
<P N="2">2 It was observable, that great part of the lands in these levels, especially those on this side East Tilbury, are held by the Farmers, Cow-keepers, and gra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Butchers, who live in and near London, and that they are generally stocked (all the winter half year) with large fat Sheep, viz.) Lincolnshire and Leicestershire wethers, which they buy in Smithfield, in September and Octo∣ber, when the Lincolnshire and Leices∣tershire Grasiers sell off their stock, and are kept here till Christmas, or Candle∣mas, or thereabouts, and though they are not made at all fatter here, than they were when bought in, yet the Farmer, or Butcher, finds very good anvantage in it, by the difference of the price <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mutton between Michaelmas when it if cheapest, and Candlemas when 'tis dear∣est; this is what the Butchers value themselves upon, when they tell us at the Market, that it is right March-Mutton.</P>
<P N="3">3 In the bottom of these Marshes, and close to the edge of the river, stands the strong fortress of Tilbury, called Tilbury Fort, which may justly be look∣ed upon, as the Key of the river of Thames, and consequently the Key of the city of London: It is a regular for∣tification, the design of it was a Penta∣gon, but the water Bastion, as it would have been called, was never built; the Plan was laid out by Sir Martin Beck∣man, chief engineer to king Charles II. who also designed the works at Sheer∣ness. The Esplanade of the fort is very large, and the Bastions, the largest of any in England, the foundation is laid so deep, and piles under that, driven down two an end of one another, so far, till they were assured they were below the channel of the river, and that the piles, which were shod with Iron, en∣tered into the solid Chalk-Rock adjoin∣ing to, or reaching from the Chalk-hills on the other side. These Bastions settled considerably at first, as did also part of the Curtain, the great quantity of Earth that was brought to fill them up, neces∣sarily, requiring to be made solid by Time; but they are now firm as the Rocks of Chalk which they came from, and the filling up one of these Bastions, as I have been told by good hands, cost the Government 6000 l. being filled with Chalk-Rubbish, fetched from the Chalk-Pits at North fleet, just above Gravesend.</P>
<P>The works to the land side are com∣pleat; the Bastions are faced with Brick. There is a double Ditch, or Moat, the innermost part of which is 180 foot broad, there is a good Counterscarp, and a covered way marked out, with Rave∣lins, and Tenailles, but they are not rais∣ed a second time after their first settling.</P>
<P><PB REF="7"/>
On the land side there are also two small redoubts of Brick, but of very little strength, for the chief strength of this Fort on the land side consists in this, that they are able to lay the whole level under water, and so make it impossible for an enemy to make any approaches to the Fort that way.</P>
<P>On the side next the river, there is a very strong curtain, with a noble gate called the water-gate in the middle, and the ditch is pal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isaded. At the place where the water-bastion was designed to be built, and which by the plan should run wholly out into the river▪ so to flank the two curtains on each side: I say, in the place where it should have been, stands a high tower, which they tell us was built in queen Elizabeth's time, and was called the block-house, the side next the water is vacant.</P>
<P>Before this curtain above and below the said vacancy, is a platform in the place of a counterscarp, on which are planted 106 pieces of cannon, generally all of them carrying from 24 to 46 pound ball; a battery, so terrible, as well im∣ports the consequence of that place: Be∣sides which, there are smaller pieces planted between, and the bastions and curtain also are planted with guns; so that they must be bold fellows who will venture in the biggest ships the world has heard of, to pass such a battery, if the men appointed to serve the guns, do their duty like stout Fellows, as becomes them.</P>
<P>The present government of this impor∣tant place is under the prudent admini∣stration of the Right Honourable the lord Newbrugh.</P>
<P>From hence, there is nothing for many miles together remarkable, but a conti∣nued level of unhealthy Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes▪ called, the Three Hundreds, till we come be∣fore Leigh, and to the mouth of the river Chelmer, and Black-water. These rivers united make a large Frith, or In∣let of the Sea, which by Mr. Camden is called Idumanum Fluvium; but by our Fishermen and Seamen, who use it as a port, 'tis called Malden-Water.</P>
<P>In this Inlet of the Sea is Osey or Osyth Island, commonly called Oosy Island, so well known by our London men of pleasure, for the infinite number of Wild-Fowl, that is to say, Duck, Mallard, Teal and Widgeon, of which there are such vast flights, that they tell us the Is∣land, namely the Creek, seems covered with them, at certain times of the year, and they go from London on purpose for the pleasure of shooting; and indeed often come home very well loaden with game. But it must be remembred too, that those gentlemen who are such lov∣ers of the sport, and go so far for it, of∣ten return with an Essex Ague on their backs, which they find a heavier load than the fowls they have shot.</P>
<P>'Tis on this shoar, and near this Creek, that the g eatest quantity of fresh fish is caught, which supplies not this country only, but London markets also. On the shoar beginning a little below Candy Island, or rather below Leigh road, there lies a great shoal o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sand called the Black Tayl, which runs out near three leagues into the Sea due East; at the end of it, stands a pole o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mast, set up by the Trinity-House men of London, whose business is, to lay buoys, and set up Sea marks for the di∣rection of the Sailors; this is called Shoo-Bacon▪ from the point of land <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here this sand begins, which is call'd Shooberry-Ness, and that from the town of Shoober∣ry▪ which stands by it. From this sand, and on the edge of Shooberry, before it, or South-West of it, all along▪ to the mouth of Colchester water, the shoar is full of shoals and sands, which some deep channels between; all which are so full of fish, that not only the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king fishing-Smacks come hither to fish, but the whole shoar is full of small fisher-Boats in very great numbers, belonging to the villages and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns on the coast, who come in every tide with what they take, and selling the smaller fish in the country, send the best and largest away upon horses, which go night and day to London market.</P>
<P><PB REF="8"/>
N. B. I am the more particular in my remark on this place, because in the course of my travels the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will meet with the like in almost every place of note through the whole Island, where it will be seen how this whole kingdom, as well the People, as the Land, and even the Sea, in every part of it, are em∣ploy'd to furnish something, and I may add, the best of every thing, to supply the city of London with provisions; I m an by provisions, Corn, Flesh, Fish, Butter, Cheese, Salt, Fewel, Timber, &amp;c. and Cloths also; with every thing ne∣cessary for building, and furniture for their own use, or for trade; of all which in their order.</P>
<P>On this Shoar also are taken the best and nicest, though not the largest Oysters in England; the spot from whence they have their common appellation is a little bank called Woelfleet, scarce to be call∣ed an Island, in the mouth of the river Crouch, now called Crooksea Water; but the chief place where the said Oysters are now had, is from Wyvenhoo and the Shoars adjacent, whither they are brought by the Fishermen, who take them at the mouth of, that they call, Colchester Water, and about the sand they call the Spits, and carry them up to Wyvenhoo, where they are laid in beds, or pits, on the shoar to feed, as they call it, and then being barrelled up, and car∣ried to Colchester, which is but three miles off, they are sent to London by land, and are, from thence, called Col∣chester Oysters.</P>
<P>The chief sort of other Fish which they carry from this part of the shoar to London, are Soals, which they take sometimes exceeding large, and yield a very good price at London market: Al∣so sometimes middling Turbet, with Whitings, Codling, and large Flounders; the small Fish as above, they sell in the Country.</P>
<P>In the several creeks and openings, as above, on this shoar, there are also other Islands, but of no particular note, except Mersey, which lies in the middle of the two openings, between Malden and Colchester water; being of the most difficult access, so that 'tis thought a thousand men well provided, might keep possession of it against a great force, whether by land or sea; on this account, and because if possessed by an enemy, it would shut up all the navigation and fishery on that side: The government formerly built a Fort on the South-East point of it: And generally, in case of a Dutch war, there is a strong body of troops kept there to defend i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>At this place may be said to end what we call the Hundreds of Essex; that is to say, the three hundreds or divisions, which include the marshy country, viz. Barnstable hundred, Rochford hundred, and Dengy hundred.</P>
<P>I have one remark more, before I leave this damp part of the world, and which I cannot omit on the womens ac∣count; namely, that I took notice of a strange decay of the Sex here, insomuch, that all along this county it was very fre∣quent to meet with men that had had from five or six, to fourteen or fifteen wives; nay, and some more; and I was inform'd that in the Marshes on the other side the river over-against Candy Island, there was a Farmer, who was then liv∣ing with the five and twentieth wise, and that his son who was but about 35 years old, had already had about four∣teen; indeed this part of the story, I only had by report, tho' from good hands too; but the other is well known, and easy to be inquired into, about Fobbing, Curringham, Thundersly, Bensleet, Prit∣tlewell, Wakering, Great Stambridge, Cricksea, Burnham, Dengy, and other towns of the like situation: The reason, as a merry follow told me, who said he had had about a dozen and half of wives, (tho' I found afterwards he fibb'd a little) was this; That they being bred in the Marshes themselves, and season'd to t he place, did pretty well with it; but that they always went up into the hilly country, or to speak their own
<PB REF="9"/>
language into the Uplands for a wife: That when they took the young lasses out of the wholesome and fresh air, they were healthy, fresh, and clear, and well; but when they came out of their native air into the Marshes, among the fogs and damps, there they presently chang'd their complection, got an Ague or two, and seldom held it above half a year, or a year at most; and then, said he, we go to the Uplands again, and fetch another; so that marrying of wives was reckon'd a kind of good farm to them: it is true, the fellow told this in a kind of drollery, and mirth; but the fact, for all that, is certainly true; and that they have abun∣dance of wives by that very means: Nor is it less true, that the inhabitants in these places do not hold it out, as in other counties, and as first you seldom meet with very ancient people among the poor, as in other places we do, so, take it one with another, not one half of the inhabitants are natives of this place; but such as from other countries, or in other parts of this county settle here for the advantage of good farms▪ forwhich I appeal to any impartial enquiry, having myself examin'd into it critically in several places.</P>
<P>From the Marshes, and low grounds, being not able to travel without many windings, and indentures, by reason of the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeks, and waters, I came up to the town of Malden, a noted market town situate at the conflux or joyning of two principal rivers in this county, the Chelm or Chemler, and the Blackwater, and where they enter into the Sea. The Channel, as I have noted, is call'd by the sailors Malden-Water, and is naviga∣ble up to the town, where, by that means, is a great trade for carrying Corn by water to London; the county of Essex being (especially on all that side) a great Corn country.</P>
<P>When I have said this, I think I have done Malden justice, and said all of it that there is to be said, unless I should run into the old story of its antiquity, and tell you it was a Roman Colony in the time of Vespasian, and that it was called Ca∣molodunum. How the Britons under queen Boadicia, in revenge for the Ro∣mans ill usage of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> used her majesty ill; they stripp'd the naked, and whipped her publickly thro' their streets for some affront she had given them. I say, how for this, she rais'd the Britons round the country, over-powered, and cut in peices the tenth legion, killed above eighty thousand Ro∣mans, and destroy'd the Colony; but was afterwards over-thrown again in a great Battle, and sixty thousand Britons slain. I say, unless I should enter into this story, I have nothing more to say of Malden, and as for that story, it is so fully related by Mr. Camden, in his history of the Romans in Britain, at the beginning of his Britannia, that I need only refer the reader to it, and go on with my journey.</P>
<P>Being obliged to come thus far into the Uplands, as above, I made it my road to pass thro' Witham, a pleasant well situ∣ated market-town, in which, and in its neighbourhood, there are as many gen∣tlemen of good fortunes, and families, as I believe can be met with in so narrow a compass in any of the three counties, of which I make this Circuit.</P>
<P>In the town of Wi ham dwels the lord Pasely, eldest son of the earl of Abercorne of Ireland, (a b anch of the noble family of Tamilton, in Scotland:) his lordship has a small, but a neat well built new house, and is finishing his gardens in such a manner, as few in that part of England will exceed them.</P>
<P>Nearer Chelmsford, hard by Boreham, lives the lord viscount Barrington, who tho' not born to the title or estate or name which he now possesses, had the honour to be twice made heir to the estates of gentlemen, not at all related to him, at least one of them as is very much to his honour mention'd in his pa∣tent of Creation. His name was Shute▪ his father a linnen draper in London, and serv'd Sheriff of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> city, in very troublesome times. He chang'd the name of Shute, for that of Barrington, by an act of parliament, obtain'd for that purpose, and had the dignity of a Baron of the kingdom conferred on him by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour of king George. His lord∣ship is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="10"/>
He was a member of parlia∣ment for the town of Berwick upon Tweed.</P>
<P>On the other side of Witham, at Fau∣burn, an ancient mansion house, built by the Romans, lives Mr. Bullock, whose father married the daughter of that emi∣nent citizen, Sir Josiah Child of Wan∣sted, by whom she had three sons, the eldest enjoys the estate, which is con∣derable.</P>
<P>It is observable, that in this part of the country, there are several very considera∣ble estates purchas'd, and now enjoy'd by citizens of London, merchants, and tradesmen, as Mr. Western an Iron mer∣chant, near Kelendon, Mr. Cresnor, a wholesale Grocer, who was, a little be∣fore, he died, nam'd for Sheriff at Earls Coln, Mr. Ol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mus, a merchant at Brain∣tree, Mr. Westcomb, near Malden, Sir Thomas Webster at Copthall, near Wal∣tham, and several others.</P>
<P>I mention this to observe how the present encrease of wealth in the city of London, spreads itself into the country, and plants families and fortunes, who in another age will equal the families of the ancient gentry, who perhaps were brought out. I shall take notice of this in a general head, and when I have run thro' all the counties, collect a list of the families of citizens and tradesmen thus established in the several counties, espe∣cially round London.</P>
<P>The product of all this part of the coun∣try is Corn, as that of the Marshy feeding grounds mention'd above is Grass, where their chief business is breeding of Calves, which I need not say are the best and fattest and the largest Veal in England, if not in the world; and as an instance, I eat part of a Veal or Calf, fed by the late Sir Josiah Child at Wanstead, the Loyn of which weigh'd above 30 l. and the flesh exceeding white and fat.</P>
<P>From hence I went on to Colchester: The story of Kill Dane, which is told of the town of Kelvedon, three miles from Witham, namely, That this is the place where the massacre of the Danes was begun by the Women, and that there∣fore it was call'd Kill-Dane. I say of it, as we generally say of improbable news, it wants confirmation. The true name of the town is Kelvedon, and has been so for many hundred years. Neither does Mr. Camden, or any other writer I meet with worth naming, insist on this piece of empty tradition the town is commonly called Keldon.</P>
<P>Colchester is an antient corporation; the town is large, very populous; the streets fair and beautiful; and though it may not be said to be finely built, yet there are abundance of very good and well built houses in it: It still mourns, in the ruins of a Civil War; during which, or rather after the heat of the War was over, it suffered a severe siege; which, the Garrison making a resolute defence, was turned into a Blockade, in which the garrison and inhabitants also, suffered the utmost extremity of hunger, and were at last obliged to surrender at discretion, when their two chief officers, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Lisle, were shot to death under the castle-wall. The inhabitants had a Tradition, that no Grass would grow upon the spot where the blood of those two gallant gentlemen was spilt; and they shewed the place bare of Grass for many years, but whether for this reason I will not affirm; the story is now dropp'd, and the Grass, I suppose, grows there as in other places.</P>
<P>However, the battered Walls, the breaches in the Turrets, and the ruined Churches still remain, except that the church of St. Mary's (where they had the royal Fort) is rebuilt; but the steeple, which was two thirds batter'd down, because the besieged had a large Culve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine upon it, that did much execution, remains still in that condition.</P>
<P>There is another church which bears the marks of those Times, namely, on the South side of the town, in the way to the Hithe, of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>The lines of Contravallation, with the Forts built by the besiegers, and
<PB REF="11" MS="y"/>
which surrounded the whole town, re∣main very visible in many places; but the chief of them are demolished.</P>
<P>The river Coln, which passes through this Town, compasses it on the North and East sides, and served in those times for a compleat defence on those sides. They have three bridges over it, one called North bridge, at the North gate, by which the road leads into Suffolk; one called East bridge, at the foot of the high street, over which lies he road to Harwich, and one at the Hithe, as a∣bove.</P>
<P>The river is navigable wi hin three miles of the town for ships of large bur∣then; a little lower it may receive even a royal Navy: And up to that part cal∣led the Hithe, close to the houses, it is navigable for Hoys and small Barks. This Hithe is a long street, passing from West to East, on the South side of the town; at the West end of it, there is a small intermission of the buildings, but not much; and towards the river it is very populous; (it may be called the Wapping of Colchester) there is one church in that part of the town, a large Key to the river, and a good Custom-house.</P>
<P>The town may be said chiefly to sub∣sist by the trade of making Bays, which is known over most of the trading parts of Europe, by the name of Colchester Bays, though indeed all the towns round carry on the same tade namely, Kel∣vedon, Whittham, Coggshall, Braintree, Bocking, &amp;c. and the whole county, large as it is, may be said to be employ∣ed, and in part maintained, by the spin∣ning of Wool for the Bay trade of Col∣chester, and its adjacent towns. The Account of the siege, Anno 1648, with a DIARY of the most remarkable pas∣sages, are as follows, which I had from so good a Hand, as that I have no reason to question its being a true Relation.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A DIARY: Or, an Account of the Siege and Blockade of Colchester, Anno 1648.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 4th of June, we were alarmed in the town of Col∣chester, that the lord Goring, the lord Capel, and a body of 2000 of the loyal party, who had been in arms in Kent, having left a great bo∣dy of an army in possession of Rochester Bridge, where they resolved to fight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he lord Fairfax, and the parliament ar∣my; had given the said General Fairfax the slip, and having pass'd at Greenwich, were con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Stratford, and were ad∣vancing this way: Upon which new<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Sir Charles Lucas, Sir George Lisle, Col. Cook, and several gentlemen of the loyal army, and all that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad commissions from the king, with a gallant appearance of gentlemen volunteers, drew together from all parts of the country, to join with them.</P>
<P>The 8th we were further informed, that they were advanc'd to Chelmsford, to New-Hall house, and to Witham; and the 9th, some of the horse arrived in the town, taking possession of the gates, and having ingeneers wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h them, told us, that General Goring had resolv'd to make this town his head quarters, and would cause it to be well fortified; they also caus d the drums to beat for volunteers; and a good number of the poor Bay-Weavers, and such like people, wanting employment, listed: So that they com∣pleated Sir Charles Lucas's regiment, which was but thin, to near eight hun∣dred men.</P>
<P><PB REF="12"/>
On the 10th we had news, that the lord Fairfax having beaten the Royalists at Maidstone, and re-taken Rochester, had pass'd the Thames at Gravesend, though with great difficulty, and with some loss, and was come to Horndon on the Hill, in order to gain Colchester be∣fore the Royalists; but that hearing Sir Charles Lucas had prevented him, had ordered his Rendezvous at Billerecay, and intended to possess the pass at Mal∣den on the 11th, where Sir Thomas Ho∣neywood, with the county trained bands, was to be the same day.</P>
<P>The same evening the lord Goring, with all his forces, making about 5600 men, horse and foot, came to Colches∣ter and encamping without the suburbs, under command of the Cannon of St. Mary's fort, made disposition to fight the Parliament forces, if they came up.</P>
<P>The 12th, the Lord Goring came in∣to Colchester, viewed the fort in St. Ma∣ry's church-yard ordered more cannon to be planted upon it; posted two regi∣ments in the suburbs, without the head gate; let the town know he would take them into his Majesty s protection; and that he would fight the enemy in that situation. The same evening, the lord Fairfax, with a strong party of 1000 horse came to Lexden, at two small miles distance, expecting the rest of his army there, the same night.</P>
<P>The lord Goring brought in prisoners the same day, Sir William Masham, and several other gentlemen of the county, who were secured under a strong guard; which the parliament hearing, order'd twenty prisoners of the royal party to be singl'd out, declaring, that they should be used in the same manner as the lord Goring used Sir William Masham, and the gentlemen prisoners with him.</P>
<P>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the 13th early in the morning, our spies brought intelligence, that the lord Fairfax, all his forces being come up to him, was making dispositions for a march, resolving to attack the royalists in their camp: Upon which, the lord Go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing drew up all his forces together, resolving to fight. The ingeneers had offered the night before to intrench his camp, and to draw a line round it in one night's time, but his lordship declined it, and now there was no time for it: Whereupon the general, lord Goring, drew up his army in order of battle▪ on both sides the road, the horse in the o∣pen fields on the wings; the foot were drawn up, one regiment in the road, one regiment on each side, and two regiments for reserve in the suburb, just at the en∣trance of the town, with a regiment of voluntiers, advanced as a forlorn hope, and a regiment of horse at the head gate, ready to support the reserve, as occasion should require.</P>
<P>About nine in the morning we heard the enemies drums beat a march, and in half an hour more their first troops appeared on the higher grounds towards Lexden; immediately the cannon from St. Mary's fired upon them, and put some troops of horse into confusion, do∣ing great execution; which, they not being able to shun it, made them quick∣en their pace, fall on, when our cannon were obliged to cease firing, left we should hurt our own troops, as well as the enemy: Soon after, their foot ap∣peared, and our cannon saluted them in like manner, and killed them a great many men.</P>
<P>Their first line of foot was led up by col. Barkstead, and consisted of three re∣giments of foot, making about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men, and these charged our regiment in the lane, commanded by Sir George Lisle, and Sir William Campton: They fell on with great fury, and were received with as much gallantry, and three times re∣pulsed, nor could they break in here, though the lord Fairfax sent fresh men to support them, till the Royalists horse oppressed with numbers on the left, were obliged to retire, and at last, to come full gallop into the street, and so on into the town: Nay, still the foot stood firm, and the voluntiers, being all gentlemen, kept their ground with the greatest re∣solution: But the left wing being rout∣ed, as above, Sir William Camton was obliged to make a front to the left; and
<PB REF="13"/>
lining the hedge with his musquereers, made a stand with a body of pikes against the enemy's Horse, and prevented them entering the lane. Here that gallant gentleman was kill'd with a Carabine shot; and after a very gallant resistance, the Horse on the right being also over∣power'd, the word was given to retreat; which however was done in such good order, the regiments of reserve standing drawn up at the end of the street, ready to receive the enemy's Horse upon the points of their pikes, that the Royal Troops came on in the openings be∣tween the regiments, and entered the town with very little loss, and in very good order.</P>
<P>By this, however, those regiments of reserve, were brought, at last, to sustain the efforts of the enemy's whole army, till being overpower'd by numbers, they were put into disorder, and forced to get into the town in the best manner they could; by which means near 200 men were kill'd or made prisoners.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this success, the enemy push'd on, supposing they should enter the town pelmel with the rest; nor did the Royalists hinder them, but let good part of Barksted's own regiment enter the head gate; but then sallying from St. Mary's with a choice body of Foot on the left, and the Horse rallying in the High-street, and charging them again in the front, they were driven back quite into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> street of the suburb, and most of those that had so rashly enter'd, were cut in pieces.</P>
<P>Thus they were repulsed at the South entrance into the town; and tho' they attempted to storm three times after that with resolution, yet they were as often beaten back, and that with great ha∣vock of their men; and the Cannon from the Fort all the while did execution upon those who stood drawn up to support them: So at last seeing no good to be done, they retreated, having small joy of their pretended victory.</P>
<P>They lost in this action Colonel Need∣ham, who commanded a negiment call'd the Tower Guards, and who fought very desperately; Capt. Cox, an old ex∣perienc'd Horse officer, and several others officers of note, with a great many pri∣vate men, tho' as they had the field they concealed their number, giving out, they lost but an hundred, when we were assured, they lost near a thousand men besides the wounded.</P>
<P>They took some of our men prisoners, occasion'd by the regiment of Colonel Farr, and two more, sustaining the shock of their whole army, to secure the retreat of the main body, as above.</P>
<P>The 16th, the lord Fairfax finding he was not able to carry the town by storm, without the formality of a siege, took his head quarters at Lexden, and sent to London, and to Suffolk for more forces; also he order'd the Trained Bands to be raised, and posted on the roads, to pre∣vent succours; notwithstanding which, divers gentlemen, with some assistance of men and arms, found means to get in∣to the town.</P>
<P>The very same night they began to break ground; and particularly, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o raise a Fort between Colchester and Lexden, to cover the Generals quarter from the salleys from the town; for the Royalists having a good body of Horse, gave them no rest, but scour'd the fields every day, and falling upon all that were found straggling from their posts, and by this means kill'd a great many.</P>
<P>The 17th, Sir Charles Lucas having been out with twelve hundred Horse, and detaching parties towards the Sea∣side, and towards Harwich, they brought in a very great quantity of provisions, and abundance of Sheep and Black Cattle, sufficient for the town for a considerable time; and had not the Suf∣folk forces advanced over Cataway-Bridge to prevent it, a larger supply had been b ought in that way; for now it appeared plainly, that the lord Fairfax finding the garrison strong and resolute, and that he was not in a condition to reduce them by force, at least without the loss of much blood,
<PB REF="14" MS="y"/>
had resolved to turn his siege into a blockade, and reduce them by hunger; their troops being also wanted to oppose several other parties, who had, in seve∣ral parts of the kingdom, taken arms, for King's cause.</P>
<P>This same day General Fairfax sent in a Trumpet, to propose exchanging prisoners, which the lord Goring rejected, expecting a reinforcement of Troops, which were actually coming to him, and were to be at Linton in Cambridgshire as the next day.</P>
<P>The same day two ships brought in a quantity of Corn and provisions, and 56 men from the shore of Kent with several gentlemen, who all landed, and came up to the town, and the greatest part of the Corn was with the utmost applica∣tion unloaded the same night into some Hoys, which brought it up to the Hithe, being apprehensive of the parliaments ships which lay at Harwich, who ha∣ving intelligence of the said ships, came the next day into the mouth of the river, and took the said two ships, and what Corn was left in them. The besieg'd sent out a party to help the ships, but ha∣ving no boats they could not assist them.</P>
<P N="18">18. Sir Charles Lucas sent an answer about exchange of prisoners, accepting the conditions offer'd, but the parliaments General returned that he would not treat with Sir Charles, for that he Sir Charles being his prisoner upon his parole of honour, and having appear'd in arms contrary to the rules of war, had forfeited his honour and faith, and was not capable of command or trust in martial affairs: To this Sir Charles sent back an answer, and his excuse for the breach of his pa∣role, but it was not accepted, nor would the lord Fairfax enter upon any treaty with him.</P>
<P>Upon this second message, Sir William Masham, and the parliament committee and other gentlemen, who were prison∣ers in the town, sent a message in writ∣ing under their hands to the lord Fairfax, intreating him to enter into a treaty for peace; but the lord Fairfax returned, he could take no notice of their request, as supposing it forced from them under restraint; but, that, if the lord Goring desir'd peace, he might write to the par∣liament, and he would cause his messen∣ger to have a safe conduct to carry his letter: There was a paper sent enclosed in this paper, sign'd Capel, Norwich, Charles, Lucas, but to that the General would return no answer, because it was sign'd by Sir Charles, for the reasons above.</P>
<P>All this while, the lord Goring, finding the enemy strengthning themselves, gave order for fortifying the town, and draw∣ing lines in several places, to secure the entrance, as particularly without the East bridge, and without the North gate and bridge, and to plant more Cannon upon the works: To which end, some great Guns were brought in from some ships at Wevenhoe.</P>
<P>The same day, our men sally'd out in three places, and attack'd the besiegers, first at their Fort, call'd Effex; then at their new works, on the South of the town; a third party sallying at the East bridge, brought in some booty from the Suffolk troops, having killed several of their straglers on the Harwich road: They also took a Lieutenant of Horse pri∣soner, and brought him into the town.</P>
<P N="19">19. This day we had the unwelcome news, that our friends at Linton were de∣seated by the enemy, and Major Mus∣champ, a loyal gentleman, kill'd.</P>
<P>The same night, our men gave the enemy alarm at their new Essex Fort, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eby drew them out as if they would fight, till they brought them with∣in reach of the Cannon of St. Mary's, and then our men retiring, the great Guns let fly among them, and made them run: Our men shouted after them; se∣veral of them were kill d on this occasion, one shot having kill'd three Horsemen in our sight.</P>
<P N="20">20. We now found the enemy in order to a perfect blockade, resolv'd to draw a line of circumvallation, round the town; having receiv'd a train of forty pieces of heavy Cannon from the tower of Lon∣don.</P>
<P><PB REF="15" MS="y"/>
This day the Parliament sent a mes∣senger to their prisoners, to know how they far'd, and how they were used; who returned word, that they far'd in∣differently well, and were very civilly used, but that provisions were scarce and therefore dear.</P>
<P>This day a party of horse with 300 foot, sally'd out, and marched as far as the fort on the Isle of Mersey, which they made a shew of attacking, to keep in the garrison; mean while the rest took a good number of cattle from the coun∣try, which they brought safe into the town, with five waggons loaden with corn: This was the last they could bring in that way, the lines being soon finish∣ed on that side.</P>
<P>This day the lord Fairfax sent in a trumpet to the Earl of Norwich, and the lord Goring, offering honourable conditions to them all; allowing all the gentlemen their lives and arms, exemp∣tion from plunder, and passes, if they desired to go beyond sea; and all the pri∣vate men pardon, and leave to go peace∣ably to their own dwellings; but the lord Goring, and the rest of the gentle∣men rejected it, and laughed at them: Upon which the lord Fairfax made pro∣clamation, that his men should give the private soldiers in Colchester free leave to pass through their camp, and go where they pleased without molestation, only leaving their arms, but that the gentle∣men should have no quarter: This was a great loss to the Royalists, for now the men, foreseeing the great hardships they were like to suffer, began to sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p away, and the lord Goring was obliged to for∣bid any to desert on pain of present death, and to keep parties of horse continually patroling to prevent them; notwith∣standing which many got away</P>
<P N="21">21. The town desired the lord Gore∣ing to give them leave to send a mes∣sage to lord Fairfax, to desire they might have liberty to carry on their trade and sell their Bays and Says, which lord Gor∣ing granted; but the enemy's general returned, that they should have consi∣dered that before they let the rovalists into the town: That to desire a free trade from a town besieged, was never heard of or at least, was such a motion, as was never yer granted: That howe∣ver, he would give the Baymakers leave to bring their Bays and Says, and other goods, once a week, or oftener, if they desire it, to Lexden Heath, where they should have a free market, and might sell them or carry them back again, if not sold, as they found occasion.</P>
<P N="22">22. The besieged sally'd out in the night with a strong party, and distur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed the enemy in their works, and partly ruined one of their forts, called Ewer's sort, where the besiegers were laying a bridge over the river Coln. Also they sally'd again at East-bridge, and faced the Suffolk troops, who were now de∣clared enemies, these brought in six and fifty good bullocks, and some cows, and they took and killed several of the ene∣my.</P>
<P N="23">23. The besiegers began to fire with their cannon from Essex fort, and from Barksted's fort, which was built upon the Malden road, and finding that the besieged had a party in Sir Harbottle Grimston's house, called, The Fryery, they fired at it with their cannon, and battered it almost down, and then the soldiers set it on fire.</P>
<P>This day, upon the townsmen's treaty for the freedom of the Bay trade, the lord Fairfax sent a second offer of condi∣tions to the besieged, being the same as before, only excepting lord Goring, lord Capel, Sir George Lisle, and Sir Charles Lucas.</P>
<P>This day we had News in the town, that the Suffolk forces were advanced to assist the besiegers, and that they began a fort called Fort Suffolk, on the North side of the town, to shut up the Suffolk road towards Stratford This day the besieged sally'd out at North-bridge, at∣tacked the out guards of the Suffolk men on Mile-End Heath, and drove them in∣to their sort in the woods.</P>
<P>This day the lord Fairfax sent a trum∣pet, complaining of chew'd and poison'd bullets being shot from the town, and
<PB REF="16" MS="y"/>
threatning to give no quarter if that practice was allowed; but lord Goring returned answer, with a protestation, that no such thing was done by his or∣der or consent.</P>
<P N="25">25. They fir'd hard from their cannon against St. Mary's steeple, on which was planted a large calvery, which annoyed them even in the general's head quarters at Lexden. One of the best gunners the garrison had▪ was killed with a cannon bullet. This night the besieged sally'd towards Audly, on the Suffolk road, and brought in some cattle.</P>
<P N="35">35. Lord Capell sent a trumpet to the Parliament general, but the rogue ran away, and came not back, nor sent any answer; whether they receiv'd his message or not, was not known.</P>
<P N="26">26. This day having finish'd their new Bridge, a party of their Troops pass'd that Bridge, and took post on the hill over-against Mile-End Church, where they built a Fort, call'd Fothergall's Fort, and another on the East side of the Road, call'd Rainsbro's Fort so that the town was entirely shut in, on that side, and the Royalists had no place free but over East-Bridge, which was afterwards cut off by the enemy's bringing their line from the Hithe within the River to the stone cause∣way leading to the East bridge.</P>
<P>July 1. From the 26th ult. to the 1st, the besiegers continu'd finishing their works, and by the 2d the whole town was shut in; at which the besiegers gave a general Salvo from their Cannon at all their Forts, but the besieged gave them a return, for they sally'd out in the night, attack'd Barkstead's fort, scarce finish'd, with such fury, that they twice enter'd the work sword in hand, kill'd most part of the defendant's, and spoil'd part of the sorts cast up; but fresh forces coming up, they retir'd with little loss, bringing eight pris∣oners, and having slain, as they reported, above 100.</P>
<P>On the second, lord Fairfax, offer'd exchange for Sir William Masham in par∣ticular, and afterwards for other prisoners but the lord Goring refus'd.</P>
<P N="5">5. The besieged sally'd with two Re∣giments, supported by some horse, at midnight; they were commanded by Sir George Lisle; they fell on with such fury, that the enemy were put into con∣fusion, their works at East-Bridge ruin'd, and two pieces of cannon taken, Lieute∣nant Col. Sambrook, and several other Officers, were kill'd, and our Men retir'd into the town, bringing the Captain, two Lieutenants, and about 50 men wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h them prisoners into the town, but having no horse, we could not bring off the cannon, but they spik'd them, and made them unfit for service.</P>
<P>From this time to the 11th, the be∣sieged, sally'd almost every night, being encourag'd by their successes, and they constantly cut off some of the Enemy, but not without loss also on their own side.</P>
<P>About this time we receiv'd by a spy, the bad news of defeating the King's friends almost in all parts of England, and particularly several parties which had good wishes to our gentlemen, and intended to relieve them.</P>
<P>Our Batteries from St. Mary's Fort and Steeple, and from the Narth-bridge, great∣ly annoy'd them, and kill'd most of their Gunners and Fire-men. One of the mes∣sengers who brought news to lord Fairfax of the defeat of one of the Parties in Kent, and the taking of Weymer Castle, slip'd into the Town, and brought a letter to the lord Goring, and listed in the Reigiment of the lord Capel'▪ horse.</P>
<P N="14">14. The besiegers attack'd and took the Hithe Church, with a small work the be∣sieged had there, but the defenders retir'd in time; some were taken prisoners in the church, but not in the fort: Sir Charles Lucas's horse was attack'd by a great bo∣dy of the besiegers; the besieged defend∣ed themselves with good resolution for some time, but a hand-grenado thrown in by the assailants, having fir'd the ma∣gazine, the house was blown up, and most of the gallant defenders buried in the ruines. This was a great blow to the Royalists, for it was a very strong pass, and always well guarded.</P>
<P N="15">15. The Lord Fairfax sent offers of hon∣ourable
<PB REF="17" MS="y"/>
conditions to the soldiers of the garrison, if they would surrender, or quit the service; upon which the Lords Goring and Capel, and Sir Charles Lu∣cas, returned an answer signed by their hands, that it was not honourable or agreeable to the usage of war, to offer conditions separately to the soldiers, exclusive of their officers, and therefore civilly desir'd his Lordship to send no more such messages or proposals, or if he did, that he would not take it ill if they hang'd up the messenger.</P>
<P>This evening all the gentlemen vo∣luntiers, with all the Horse of the garri∣son, with Sir Charles Lucas, Sir Geo. Lisle, and Sir Bernard Gascoign at the head of them, resolved to break through the enemy, and foreing a pass to advance into Suffolk by Nayland Bridge; to this purpose, they pass'd the river near Mid∣dle Mill; but their guides having mis∣lead them the enemy took the alarm; upon which their guides, and some pio∣neers which they had with them, to open the Hedges, and level the banks, for their passing to Boxted, all run away; so the House were obliged to retreat; the enemy pretended to pursue, but thinking they had retreated by the North Bridge, they miss'd them; upon which being enraged, they fir'd the sub∣urbs without the Bridge, and burn'd them quire down.</P>
<P N="18">18. Some of the Horse attempted to escape the same way; and had the whole body been there as before, they had effected it; but there being but two Troops, they were obliged to retire. Now the town began to be greatly distress'd, provisions sailing; and the towns people, which were numerous, being very uneasy, and no way of break∣ing through being found practicable, the gentlemen would have joined in any attempt wherein they might die gallantly with their swords in their hands, but nothing presented, they often sally'd and cut off many of the enemy, but their numbers were continually sup∣plied, and the besi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gsd diminished; their Horse also sunk and became unfit for ser∣vice, having very little Hay, and no Corn; and at length they were forced to kill them for food; so that they began to be in a very miserable condition, and the soldiers deserted every day in great numbers, not being able to bear the want of food, as being almost starved with hunger.</P>
<P N="22">22. The Lord Fairfax offered a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain an exchange of prisoners, but the Lo d Goring rejected it, because they refused conditions to the chief gentlemen of the garrison.</P>
<P>During this time, two Troops of the Royal Horse sallied out in the night, resolving to break out or die: The first rode up full gallop to the enemy's Horse-Guards on the side of Malden road, and exchanged their pistols with the advanced Troops, and wheeling, made as if they would retire to the town; but finding they were not immediately pursued, they wheeled about to the right and passing another guard at a distance, without being perfectly discovered, they went clean off, and passing towards Tiptree Heath, and having good guides, they made their escape towards Cam∣bridgeshire, in which length of way they way they found means to disperse wi h∣out being attack d, and went every man his own way as fate directed; nor did we hear that many of them were taken; they were led, as we are informed, by Sir Bernard Gascoigne.</P>
<P>Upon these attempts of the Horse to break out, the enemy built a small Fort in the Meadow right against the Ford, in the river, at the middle Mill, and once set that Mill on fire but it was extin∣guished without much damage; how∣ever the Fort prevented any more attempts that way.</P>
<P N="22">22. The Parliament General sent in a Trumpet, to propole again the exchange of prisoners, offering the Lord Capel's son for one, and Mr. Ashburnham, for Sir William Masham; but the Ld. Capel, Ld. Goring, and the rest of the loyal gen∣tlemen rejected it; and Ld. Capel in parti∣cular sent the Ld. Fairfax word, it was in∣human to surprize his son, who was not
<PB REF="18" MS="y"/>
in arms, and offer him to insult a fa∣ther's affection, but that he might mur∣der his son if he pleased, he would leave his blood to be revenged as Heaven should give opportunity; and the lord Goring sent word, that as they had re∣duced the King's servants to eat Horse∣flesh, the prisoners should feed as they fed.</P>
<P>The enemy sent again to complain of the Royalists shooting poison'd bullets, and sent two affidavits of it made by two deserters, swearing it was done by the lord Norwich's direction: The Ge∣nerals in the town returned under all their hands, that they never gave any such command or direction; that they disown'd the practice; and that the fel∣lows who swore it, were perjured before in running from their colours, and the service of their King, and ought not to be credited again: But they added, that for shoo ing rough-cast slugs they must excuse them, as things stood with them at that time.</P>
<P>About this time a porter in a sol∣dier's habit got through the enemy's leaguer, and passing their out-guards in the d rk, got into the town, and brought letters from London, assuring the Royal∣ists, that there were so many strong par∣ties up in arms for the King, and in so many places, that they would be very suddenly reliev'd: This they caus'd to be read to the soldiers to encourage them; and particularly it relating to the rising of the Earl of Holland, and the Duke of Buckingham, who with 500 Horse were got<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en together in arms about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gston in Surrey; but we had notice i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few days after, that they were def<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated, and the Earl of Hol∣land taken, who was afterwards be∣he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded.</P>
<P N="26">26. The enemy now began to batter the walls, and especially on the West∣side, from St. Mary's towards the North Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; and we were assured they intended a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o m; on which the Engineers were directed to make Trenches behind the walls where the breaches should be made, that in case of a storm, they might meet with a warm reception: Upon this, they gave over the design of storming. The Lord Goring finding that the enemy had set the suburbs on fire right against the Hithe ordered the remaining houses, which were empty of inhabitants, from whence their Mus∣keters fir'd against the town, to be burn'd also.</P>
<P N="31">31. A body of Foot sally'd out at midnight, to discover what the enemy were doing at a place where they thought a new Fort was raising; they fell in among the workmen, and put them to flight, cut in pieces several of the guard, and brought in the officer who command∣ed them prisoner.</P>
<P>Aug. 2. The town was now in a miserable condition, the soldiers searched rifled the houses of the inhabitants for victuals; they had liv'd on Horse-flesh several weeks, and most of that also was lean as Carrion, which not being well salted bred Wens; and this want of diet made the soldiers sickly, and many died of Fluxes, yet they boldly rejected all offers of surrender, unless with safety to their officers: However, several hundreds got out, and either pass'd the enemy's guards, or surrender'd to them, and took passes.</P>
<P>Aug. 7. The town's people became very uneasy to the soldiers, and the Mayor of the town, with the Alder∣men, waited upon the General, desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing leave to send to the lord Fairfax, for leave to all the inhabitants to come out of the town, that they might not perish: to which the lord Goring consented; but the lord Fairfax refused them.</P>
<P N="12">12. The Rabble got together in a vast crowd about the lord Goring's quar∣ters, clamouring for a surrender, and they did this every evening, bringing women and children, who lay howling and crying on the ground for bread; the soldiers beat off the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> len, but the women and children would not stir, bidding the soldiers kill them, saying they had rather be shot than be starv'd.</P>
<P N="16">16. The general moved by the cries and distress of the poor inhabitants, sent
<PB REF="19" MS="y"/>
out a trumpet to the Parliament general, demanding leave to send to the prince, who was with a fleet of 19 men of war in the mouth of the Thames, offering to surrender, if they were not relieved in 20 days. The lord Fairfax refused it, and sent them word, he would be in the Town in person, and visit them in less than 20 days, intimating that they were preparing for a storm. Some tart messa∣ges and answers were exchanged on this occasion. The lord Goring sent word, they were willing, in compassion to the poor town's people, and to save the ef∣fusion of blood, to surrender upon ho∣nourable terms, but that as for the storm∣ing them, which was threatened, they might come on when they thought fit, for that they (the Royalists) were ready for them. This held to the 19th:</P>
<P N="20">20. The lord Fairfax returned, what he said, was his last answer, and should be the last offer of mercy: The condi∣tions offered were, That upon a peace∣able surrender, all soldiers and officers un∣der the degree of a captain, in commis∣sion, should have their lives, be exempt∣ed from plunder, and have passes to go to their respective dwellings: All the captains and superior officers, with all the lords and gentlemen, as well in com∣mission as voluntiers, to surrender priso∣ners at discretion, only that they should not be plundered by the soldiers.</P>
<P N="21">21. The generals rejected those offers; and when the people came about them again for bread, set open one of the gates, and bid them go out to the enemy, which a great many did willingly; up∣on which the lord Goring ordered all the rest that came about his door, to be turned out after them: But when the people came to the lord Fairfax's camp, the outguards were ordered to fire at them, and drive them all back again to the gate; which the lord Goring seeing, he ordered them to be received in again. And now, although the generals and soldiers also, were resolute to die with their swords in their hands, rather than yield, and had maturely resolved to a∣bide a storm; yet the mayor and alder∣men having petitioned them, as well as the inhabitants, being wearied with the importunities of the distressed people, and pitying the deplorable condition the were reduced to, they agreed to en∣ter into a treaty, and accordingly, sent out some officers to the lord Fairfax, they Parliament general, to treat; and with them was sent two gentlemen of the pri∣soners, upon their parole to return.</P>
<P>Upon the return of the said messen∣gers with the lord Fairfax's terms, the lord Goring, &amp;c. sent out a letter, de∣claring they would die with their swords in their hands, rather than yield with∣out quarter for life, and sent a paper of articles, on which they were willing to surrender: But in the very intrim of this treaty, news came, that the Scots army under duke Hamilton, which was enter∣ed into Lancashire, and was joined by the Royalists in that county, making 21,000 men, were entirely defeated. Af∣ter this, the lord Fairfax would not grant any abatement of articles, viz. To have all, above Lieutenants, surrender at mer∣cy.</P>
<P>Upon this the lord Goring and the ge∣neral refused to submit again, and pro∣posed a general fally, and to break th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o' or die, but found, upon preparing for it, that the soldiers, who had their lives offered them, declined it, scaring the gentlemen would escape, and they should be left to the mercy of the Par∣liament soldiers; and that upon this they began to muitny, and talk of surrender∣ing the town, and their officers too. Things being brought to this pass, the Lords and General laid aside that design, and found themselves oblig'd to submit: And so the town was surrendred the 28th of August, 1648, upon condition, as follows:</P>
<P>The Lords and Gentlemen all prison∣ers at mercy.</P>
<P>The common soldiers had passes to go home to their several dwell∣ings, but without arms, and an oath not to serve against the Parliament.</P>
<P><PB REF="20" MS="y"/>
The town to be preserv'd from pil∣lage, paying 14000 l. ready money.</P>
<P>The same day, a council of war being called about the prisoners of war, it was resolved, That the lords should be left to the disposal of the Parliament. That Sir Charles Lucas, Sir George Lisle, and Sir Marm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duke Gas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oign, should be shot to death, and the other officers prisoners, to remain in custody till farther order.</P>
<P>The two first of the three gentlemen were shot to death, and the third re∣spited.</P>
<P>Thus ended the siege of Colchester.</P>
<P>N. B. Notwithstanding the number killed in the siege, and dead of the flux, and other distempers, occasi∣oned by bad diet, which were ve∣ry many, and notwithstanding the number which deserted and escap∣ed in the time of their hardships, yet there remained at the time of the surrender,

<P>The town of Colchester has been sup∣posed to contain about 40,000 people, including the out-villages which are within its liberty, of which there are a great many, the liberty of the town be∣ing of a great extent: One sad testimo∣ny of the town being so populous is, that they bury'd upwards of 5259▪ peo∣ple in the Plague year, 1665. But the town was severely visited indeed, ever more in proportion than any of its neigh∣bours, or than the city of London.</P>
<P>The government of the town is by a Mayor, high Steward, a Recorder, or his deputy, eleven Aldermen, a Chamber∣lain, a town-clerk, assistants, and eigh∣teen common council men. Their high∣steward (this yea, 1722.) is Sir Isaac Rebow, a gentleman of a good family and known character, who has general∣ly, for above 30 years, been one of their representatives in Parliament: He has a very good house at the entrance in at the South, or head gate of the town, where he has had the honour, several times to lodge and entertain the late king William, of glorious memory, in his return∣ing from Holland, by way of Harwich, to London. Their recorder is Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Cow∣per, who has been twice lord high cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cellor of England: But his lordship n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> residing in those parts, has put in his deputy,—Price, Esq; barrister at Law, and who dwells in the town. There are in Colchester eight churches, besides those which are damaged, and five meeting-houses, whereof two for Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣kers; besides a Dutch church, and a French church.</P>
<P>Publick Edifi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es are▪</P>
<P N="1">1. Bay-Hall, an ancient society kept up for ascertaining the manufactures of Bays; which a e, or ought to be, all brought to this hall, to be viewed and sealed according to their goodness, by the masters; and to this practice has been owing the great reputation of the Colchester Bays in foreign marke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; where to open the side of a bale and show the seal, has been enough to give the buyer a character of the value as the goods, without any farther search; and so far as they abate the integrity and exactness of their method, which, I am told, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> late is much omitted; I say, so far, that reputation will certainly abate in the markets they go to, which are princi∣pally in Portugal and Italy. This cor∣poration is governed by a particular fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of men, who are called Governors of the
<PB REF="21" MS="y"/>
Dutch Bay Hall. And in the same build∣ing is the Dutch Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Guild Hall of the Town, called by them the Moot Hall; to which is an∣nex'd the Town Goal.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Work-house, being lately en∣larg'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which belongs a Corpo a∣tion, or Body of inhabitants, consisting of Sixty Persons incorporated by Act of Parliament Anno 1698, for taking Care of the Poor: They are incorporated by the Name and Title of The Gover or, Deputy Governor, Assistants, and Guardi∣ans, of the Poor of the Town of Col hester. They are in Number Eight and Forty; to whom are added the Mayor and Aldermen for the time being who are always Guar∣dians by the same Charter: These make the Number of Sixty, as above.</P>
<P>There is also a Grammar Free-School, with a good Allowance to the Master, who is chosen by the Town.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Castle of Colchester is now be∣come only a Monument shewing the An∣tiquity of the Place, it being built as the Walls of the Town also are, with Roman Bricks; and the Roman Coins dug up here, and ploughed up in the Fields ad∣joining, confirm it. The Inhabitants boast much, that Helena, the Mother of Constantine the Great, first Christian Em∣peror of the Romans, was born there; and it may be so for ought we know; I only observe what Mr. Camden says of the Castle of Colchester, viz.</P>
<P>In the middle of this City stands a Ca∣stle ready to fall with Age.</P>
<P>Tho' this Castle has stood an hundred and twenty Years from the Time Mr. Camden wrote that Account, and it is not fallen yet; nor will another hundred and twenty Years, I believe, make it look one jot the older: And it was ob∣servable, that in the late siege of this Town, a common Shot, which the be∣siegers made at this old Castle, were so far from making it fall, that they made little or no Impression upon it; for which Reason, it seems, and because the Garri∣son made no great use of it against the besiegers, they fir'd no more at it.</P>
<P>There are two Charity Schools set up here, and carried on by a generous Subscription, with very good Success.</P>
<P>The Title of Colchester is in the Fami∣ly of the Earl ivers; and the eldest Son of that Family, is called Lord Colchester; tho', as I understand, the Title is not settled by the Creation, to the eldest Son, till he enjoys the Title of Earl with it; but that the other is by the Courtesy of England; however this I take <HI>ad re∣ferendum.</HI></P>
<P>From Colchester, I took another step do n to the coast, the Land running out a g eat way into he Sea, South, and S. E. makes that Promontory of Land called the Nase, and well known to Seamen, using the Northern Trade. Here one sees a Sea open as an Ocean, without any opposite shore, tho' it be no more than the Mouth of the Thames. This Point call'd the Nase, and the N. F. Point of Kent, near Margate, call'd the North Foreland, making (what they call) the mouth of the River, and the Port of London, tho' it be here above 60 Miles over.</P>
<P>At Walton, under the Nase, they find on the Shoar, Copperas-Stone in great Quantities; and there are several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge Work, call'd Copperas Houses, where they make it with great expence.</P>
<P>On this Promonto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is a new Mark, erected by the Trinity-House Men, and at the Publick Expence, being a round Brick Tower, near 80 Foot high. The Sea gains so much upon the Land here, by the continual Winds at S. W. that within the memory of some of the Inha∣bitants there▪ they have lost above 30 Acres of Land in one Place</P>
<P>From hence we go back into the County about four Miles, because of the Creeks which lie between; and then turning East again, come to Harwich, on the utmost Eastern Point of this large coun∣try.</P>
<P>Harwich is a Town so well known, and so perfectly describ'd by many Writers, I need say little of it: 'Tis strong by Situation, and may be made more so
<PB REF="22" MS="y"/>
by Art. But 'tis many Years since the Government of England have had any occasion to fortify Towns to the Land∣ward, 'tis enough that the Harbour or Road, which is one of the best and secu∣rest in England, is cover'd at the Entrance by a strong Fort, and a Battery of Guns to the Seaward, just as at Tilbury, and which sufficiently defend the Mouth of the River: And there is a particular Felicity in this Fortification, viz. That tho' the Entrance or Opening of the River into Sea, is very wide, especially at High-wa∣ter, at least two Miles, if not three over; yet the Channel which is deep, and in which the Ships must keep and come to the Harbour is narrow, and lies only on the side of the Fort; so that all the Ships which come in, or go out, must come close under the Guns of the Fort; that is to say, under the command of their Shot.</P>
<P>The Fort is on the Suffolk side of the Bay, or Entrance, but stands so far into the Sea upon the Point of a Sand or Shoal, which runs out toward the Essex-side, as it were, laps over the Mouth of that Ha∣ven like a Blind to it; and our Surveyors of the country affirm it to be in the Coun∣ty of Essex. The making this Place, which was formerly no other than a Sand in the Sea, solid enough for the Foundation of so good a Fortification, has not been done but by many Years Labour, often Repairs, and an infinite Expence of Mo∣ney, but 'tis now so firm, that nothing of storms and high Tides, or such Things, as make the Sea dangerous to these kind of Works, can effect it.</P>
<P>The Harbour is of a vast Extent; for, as two Rivers empty themselves here, viz. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Maningtree, and the Orwel from Ipswich; the Channels of both are large and deep, and safe for all weathers; to where they joyn they make a large Bay or Road, able to receive the biggest Ships, and the greatest Number that ever the World saw together; I mean Ships of War. In the old Dutch War, great Use has been made of this Harbour; and I have known that there has been 100 Sail of Men of War and their Attendants, and between three and four hundred Sail of Collier Ships, all in this Harbour at a time and yet none of them crowding, or riding in danger of one another.</P>
<P>Harwich is known for being the Port where the Packet-Boats, between England and Holland, go out and come in: The in∣habitants are far from being fam'd for good Usage to Strangers, but on the contrary, are blamed for being extravagant in their Reckonings, in the Publick Houses, which has not a little encourag'd the setting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Sloops, which they now call Passage-Boats, to Holland, to go directly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the River of Thames; this, 'tho it may be something the longer passage, yet a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are said to be more obliging to Passengers, and more reasonable in the Expence, and as some say also the Vessels are better Sea Boats, has been the Rea∣son why so many Passengers do not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> come by the way of Harwich, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were wont to do; insomuch, that the Stage Coaches; between this Place and London, which ordinarily went twice o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> three times a Week, are now entirely laid down, and the Passengers are left to hire Coaches on purpose, take Post-Horses or hire Horses to Colchester, as they find most convenient.</P>
<P>The account of a petrifying quality <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Earth here, tho' some will have it to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Water of a Spring hard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very strange: They boast that their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is Wall'd, and their Streets pav'd with Clay, and yet, that one is as strong, and the other as clean as those that are built or pav'd with Stone: The Fact is indeed true for there is a sort of Clay in the Cliff, be∣tween the Town and the Beacon-Hill ad∣joining, which when it falls down into the Sea, where is is beaten with the Waves and the Weather, turns gradually into Stone: But the chief Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is from the Water of a certain Spring or Well, which rising in the said Cliff, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uns down into the Sea among those pieces of Clay, and petrifies them as it runs; and the Force of the Sea often stirring, and perhaps, turning the lumps of Clay, when storms of Wind may give force enough to the Water, causes them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every where alike; those that were not
<PB REF="23" MS="y"/>
quite sunk in the Water of the Spring would be petrify'd but in part. These Stones are gathered up to pave the Streets, and build the Houses, and are indeed very hard: 'Tis also remarkable, that some of them taken up before they are thoroughly petrify'd, will, upon breaking them, appear to be hard as a Stone without, and soft as Clay in the Middle; whereas others, that have lain a due Time, shall be thorough Stone to the Center, and as exceeding hard with∣in as without: The same Spring is said to turn Wood into Iron: But this I take to be no more or less than the Quality which, as I mentioned of the Shoar at the Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, is found to be in much of the Stone, all along this Soar, (viz.) of the Copperas kind, and 'tis certain, that the Copperas Stone (so called▪ is found in all that Cliff, and even where the Water of this Spring has run; and I presume, that those, who call the harden'd Pieces of wood, which they take out of this Well by the Name of Iron, never try'd the Quality of it with the Fire or Ham∣mer; if they had, perhaps they would have given some other Account of it.</P>
<P>On the Promontory of Land▪ which they call Beacon-Hill, and which lies beyond, or behind the Town, towards the Sea, there is a Light-House, to give the Ships Directions in their sailing by, as well as their coming into the Harbour in the Night. I shall take Notice of these again all together, when I come to speak of the Society of Trinity-House, as they are called, by whom they are all directed upon this Coast.</P>
<P>This Town was erected into a Mar∣qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, in Honour of the truly glorious Family of Schomberg, the eldest Son of Duke Schomberg, who landed with King William 3d, being stiled Marquis of Har∣wich; but that Family (in England at least) being extinct, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itle dies also.</P>
<P>Harwich is a Town of Hurry and Business, not much of Gaiety and Plea∣sure; yet the Inhabitants seem warm in their Nests, and some of them are very Wealthy: There are not many (if any) Gentlemen, or Families of Note, either in the Town, or very near it. They send two Members to Parliament; the present are, Sir Peter Parker, and Hum∣phrey Parsons, Esq;</P>
<P>And now, being at the Extremity of the County of Essex, of which I have given you some View, as to that side next the Sea only; I shall break off this Part, by telling you that I will take the Towns which lie more towards the Cen∣ter of the County, in my Return by the North and West Part only, that I may give you a few Hints of some Town; which were near me in my Rout this way, and of which being so well known, there is but little to say.</P>
<P>On the Road from London to Colches∣ter, before I came into it at Witham, lie four good Market Towns at equal Di∣stance from one another; namely, Rum∣ford, noted for two Markets, viz. one for Calves and Hogs, the other for Corn and other Provisions; most, if not all, bought up for London Market. At the farther End of the Town, in the middle of a stately Park stood Guldy Hall, vul∣garly Giddy Hall, an ancient Seat of one Coke, some Time Lord Mayor of Lon∣don, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orfeited on some Occasion, to the Crown: It is since pulled down to the Ground, and there now stands a no∣ble stately Fabrick, or Mansion House, built upon the Spot by Sir John Eyles, a wealthy Merchant of London, and chosen Sub Governor of the South Sea Company, immediately after the Ruin of the former Sub Governor and Direc∣tors, whose Overthrow makes the Histo∣ry of those Times famous.</P>
<P>Brent-Wood and Ingarstone, and even Chelmsford itself, have very little to be said of them, but that they are large thorough-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air Towns, full of good Inns, and chiefly maintained by the excessive Multitude of Carriers and Passengers, which are constantly passing this way to London, with Droves of Cattle, Pro∣visions, and Manufactures for London.</P>
<P>The last of these Towns is indeed the County Town, where the County Jail is kept, and where the Assize<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are very often held; it stands on the Conflux
<PB REF="24" MS="y"/>
of two Rivers, the Chelmer, whence the Town is called and the Cann.</P>
<P>At Lees, or Lee's Priory, as some call it, is to be seen an ancient House, in the middle of a beautiful Park, formerly the Seat of the late Duke of Manchester, but since the death of the Duke, it is sold to the Duchess Dowager of Bucking∣hamshire; the present Duke of Manche∣ster, retiring to his ancient Family Seat at Kimbolton in Huntingdonshire, it be∣ing a much finer Residence. His Grace is lately married to a Daughter of the Duke of Montagu, by a Branch of the House of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lborough</P>
<P>Four Market Towns fill up the rest of this Part of the Country; Dunmow, Braintree, Thaxted, and Cogg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall; all noted for the Manufacture of Bays, as above, and for very little else, except I shall make the Ladies laugh, at the fa∣mous old Story of the Flitch of Bacon at Dunmow, which is this:</P>
<P>One Robert Fitz Walter, a powerful Baron in this County, in the Time of Henry III. on some merry Occasion, which is not preserved in the rest of the Story, instituted a Custom in the Priory here: <Q>“That whatever married Man did not Repent of his being marry'd, or Quarrel, or Differ or Dispute with his Wife within a Year and a Day after his Marriage, and would Swear to the Truth of it, kneeling upon two hard pointed Stones in the Church Yard, which Stones he caused to be set up in the Priory Church Yard, for that Purpose. The Prior and Convent, and as many of the Town as would, to be present, such Person should have a Flitch of Bacon.”</Q></P>
<P>I do not remember to have read, that any one ever came to demand it; nor do the People of the Place pretend to say, of their own Knowledge, that they remember any that did so; a long Time ago several did demand it, as they say, but they know not who; neither is there any Record of it; nor do they tell us, if it were now to be demanded, who is obliged to deliver the Flitch of Bacon, the Priory being dissolved and gone.</P>
<P>The Forest of Epping and Henalt, spreads a great Part of this Country still: I shall speak again of the former in my return from this Circuit Former∣ly ('tis thought) these two Forests took up all the West and South Part of the County; but particularly we are assured, that it reach'd to the River Chelmer, and into Dengy Hundred; and from thence again West to Epping and Wal∣tham, where it continues to be a Forest still.</P>
<P>Probably this Forest of Epping has been a Wild, or Forest, ever since this Island was inhabited, and may shew us, in some Parts of it, where Enclosures and Tillage has not broken in upon it, what the Face of this Island was befo e the Romans Time; that is to say, before their landing in Britain.</P>
<P>The Constitution of this Forest is best seen, I mean as to the Antiquity of it, by the merry Grant of it from Edward the Confessor, before the Norman Con∣quest, to Randolph Peperking, one of his Favourites, who was after called <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> e∣verell, and whose Name remains still in several Villages in this County; as par∣ticularly that of Hatfield Pevereli, in the Road from Chelmsford to Witham, which is supposed to be originally a Park, which they called a Field in those Days▪ and Hartfield may be as much as to say a Park for Deer; for the Stags were in those Days called Harts; so that this was neither more nor less than Randolph Pe∣perking's Hartfield; that is to say, Ralph Peverell's Deer-Park.</P>
<P>N B. This Ralp Randolph, or Ralph Peverell, (call him as you please) had, it seems, a most beautiful Lady to his Wife, who was Daughter of Ingelrick, one of Edward the Confessor's Noble∣men: He had two Sons by her, William Peverell, a fam'd Soldier, and Lord or Governor of Dover-Castle; which he surrendered to William the Conqueror, after the Battle in Sussex: and Pain Pe∣verell, his youngest, who was Lord of Cambridge: When the eldest Son deli∣vered up the Castle, the Lady his Mo∣ther, above-named, who was the cele∣brated

Beauty of the Age, was it seems there; and the Conqueror fell in Love with her, and whether by Force, or by Consent, took her away, and she became his Mistress, or what else you please to call it: By her he had a Son, who was call'd William, after the Conqueror's Christian Name, but retain'd the Name of Peverell, and was afterwatds created by the Conqueror, Lord of Nottingham.</P>
<P>This lady afterwards, as is supposed, by way of Penance, for her yielding to the Conqueror, founded a Nunnery at the Village of Hatfield-Peverel, men∣tioned above, and there she lies buried in the Chapel of it, which is now the Parish Church, where her Memory is preserv'd by a Tomb-stone under one of the windows.</P>

There are many Gentlemen's Seats on this side the Country, and a great Assem∣bly set up at New Hall, near this Town much resorted to by the Neighbouring Gentry. I shall next proceed to the Coun∣ty of Suffolk, as my first design directed me to do.</P>
<P>From Harwich therefore, having a mind to view the Harbour, I sent my Horses round by Maningtree, where there is a Timber Bridge over the Stour called Ca∣taway-Bridge, and took a Boat up the Ri∣ver O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>well for Ipswich: A Traveller will hardly understand me, especially a Seaman, when I speak of the River Stour and the River Orwell at Harwich, for they know them by no other Names than those of Maningtree-Water, and Ipswich-Water; so while I am on salt Water, I must speak as hose who use the Sea may understand me, and when I am up in the Country among the In-land Towns again, I shall call them out of their Names no more.</P>
<P>It is twelve Miles from Harwich up the Water to Ipswich: Before I come to the Town, I must say something of it, because speaking of the River requires it: In for∣mer times, that is to say since the Writer of this remembers the Place very well, and particularly just before the late Dutch Wars, Ipswich was a Town of very good Business; particulary it was the greatest Town in England for large Colli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs or Coal-ships, employed between New Ca∣stle and London: Also they built the big∣gest Ships and the best, for the said fetch∣ing of Coals of any that were employ'd in that Trade: They built also there so pro∣digious strong, that it was an ordinary thing for an Ipswich Collier, if no Disaster happen'd to him, to reign (as Seamen call it) forty or fifty Years, and more.</P>
<P>In the Town of Ipswich the Masters of these Ships generally dwelt, and there were, as they then told me, above a hun∣dred Sail of them, belonging to the Town at one time, the least of which carried Fif∣teen-score, as they compu e it, that is, 300 Chaldron of Coals; this was about the Year 1668 (when I first knew the Place) This made the Town be at that time so populous, for those Masters, as they had good Ships at Sea, so they had large Fa∣milies, who liv'd plentifully, and in very good Houses in the Town, and several Streets were chiefly Inhabited by such.</P>
<P>The loss o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> decay of this Trade, ac∣counts for the present pretended decay of the Town of Ipswich, of which I shall speak more presently: The Ships wore out, the Masters died off, the Trade took a new Turn, Dutch Flyboats taken in the War, and made free Ships by Act of Par∣liament, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust themselves into the Coal-Trade for the Interest of the Captors, such as the Yarmouth and London Merchants, and others; and the Ipswich Men dropt gradually out of it▪ being discouraged by those Dutch Flyboats: These Dutch Ves∣sels which cost nothing but the Caption, were bought cheap, carried great Bur∣thens, and the Ipswich building fell off for want of Price, and so the Trade de∣cay'd, and the Town with it, I believe this will be own'd for the true beginning of their decay, if I must allow it to be call'd a decay.</P>
<P>But to return to my Passage up the Ri∣ver. In the Winter-time those great Col∣lier-Ships, abovemention'd, are always laid up, as they call it: This is to say, the Coal Trade abates at London, the Citizens are generally furnish'd, their Stores taken in, and the Demand is over; so that the great Ships, the Northern Seas and Coast being also dangerous, the Nights long, and the Voyage hazardous, go to Sea no more, but lie by, the Ships are unrigg'd, the Sails, &amp;c. carry,d a Shore, the Top-Masts struck, and they ride Moor'd in the River, under the ad∣vantages and security of found Ground, and a high Woody Shore, where they lie as safe as in a wet Dock; and it was a very agreeable sight to see, perhaps two Hun∣dred Sail of Ships▪ of all sizes lie in that Posture every Winter: All this while, which was usually from Michelmas to La∣dy Day, The Masters liv'd calm and se∣cure with their Families in Ipswich; and enjoying plentifully, what in the Summer they got laboriously at Sea, and this made the Town of Ipswich very Populous in the Winter; for as the Masters▪ so most of the Men, especially their Mates, Boatswains, Carpenters, &amp;c. were of the same Place, and liv d in their Proportions, just as the Masters did: so that in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>
<PB REF="27" MS="y"/>
might be perhaps a Thousand Men in the Town more than in the Summer, and perhaps a gretter Number.</P>
<P>To justify what I advance here, that this Town was formerly very full of Peo∣ple, I ask leave to refer to the Account of Mr. Camden. and what it was in his Time, his Wo d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are these.</P>
<P><Q>“”Ipswich has a commodious Harbour, has been fortified with a Ditch and Rampart, has a great Trade, and is very Populous; being adorned with 14 Churches, and large private Buildings.</Q></P>
<P>This confirms what I have mentioned of the former State of this Town; but the present State is my proper Work; I there∣fore return to my Voyage up the River.</P>
<P>The sight of these ships thus laid up in the River, as I have said, was very agree∣able to me in my Passage from Harwich, about 35 Years before the present Jour∣ney; and it was in its Proportion equal∣ly Melancholy to hear, that there were now searce 40 Sail of good Colliers that belonged to the whole Town</P>
<P>In a creek in this River, call'd Laving∣ton-creek, we saw at low Water, such Shoals, or Hills rather, of Muscles, that great Boats might have loaded with them, and no miss have been made of them. Near this creek Sir Samuel Barnadiston had a very fine Seat as also a Decoy for wild Ducks and a very noble Estate; but it is divided into many Branches since the death of the ancient Possessor; but I pro∣ceed to the Town, which is the first in the County of Suffolk of any note this Way.</P>
<P>Ipswich is seated, at the distance of 12 Miles from Harwich, upon the edge of the River, which taking a short turn to the West, the Town forms, there, a kind of Semi circle, or half Moon upon the Bank of the River: It is very remarka∣ble, that tho' Ships of 500 Tun may, up∣on a Spring Tide, come up very near this Town, and many Ships of that Burthen have been built there; yet the River is not Navigable any farther than the Town itself, or but very little; no not for the smallest Boats, nor does the Tide which rises sometimes 13 or 14 Foot, and gives them 24 foot Water very near the Town, flow much farther up the River than the Town, or not so much as to make it worth speaking of.</P>
<P>He took little notice of the Town, or at least of that part of Ipswich, who pub∣lished in his wild Observations on it, that Ships of 200 Tun are built there: I affirm, that I have seen a ship of 400 Tun launch d at the Building-yard, close to the Town, and I appeal to the Ipswich Colliers (those few that remain) belonging to this Town▪ if several of them carrying 17 score of Coals, which must be upward of 400 Tun, have not formerly been built here; but superficial Observers must be superfi∣cial Writers, if they write at all; and to this Day, at John's Ness, within a Mile and half of the Town itself, Ships of a∣ny Burthen may be built and launched, even at neap Tides.</P>
<P>I am much mistaken too, if since the Revolution, some very good ships have not been built at this Town, and particu∣larly the Melford or M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lford-gally, a ship of 40 Guns; as the Greyhound Frigate, a Man of War of 36 to 40 Guns, was at John's Ness. But what is this toward's lessening the Town of Ipswich, any more than it would be to say, they do not build Men of War or East-Indi <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ships, or ships of 500 Tun Burthen at St. Catherines, or at Battle-Bridge in the Thames, when we know that a Mile or two lower, viz. at Rateliffe, Limehouse, or Deptford, they build Ships of 1000 Ton, and might build first rate Men of War too, if there was occasion; and the like might be done in this River of Ipswich, within about two or three Miles of the Town; so that it would not be at all an out of the way speaking to say, such a ship was built at Ipswich, any more than it is to say, as they do, that the Royal Prince, the great Ship lately built for the South-Sea Com∣pany, was London built, because she was built at Limehouse.</P>
<P>And why then is not Ipswich capable of building and receiving the greatest Ships in the Navy, seeing they may be built and brought up again Loaden, with∣in a Mile and half of the Town?</P>
<P><PB REF="28" MS="y"/>
But the neighbourhood of London, which sucks the Vitals of Trade in this Island to itself, is the chief Reason of a∣ny decay of Business in this Place; and I shall in the course of these Observations, hint at it, where many good Sea-Ports, and large Towns, tho' farther off than Ipswich, and as well fitted for Com∣merce, are yet swallow'd up by the im∣mense Indra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Trade to the City of London; and more decay'd beyond all Comparison, than Ipswich is supposed to be; as Southampton, Weymouth, Dartmouth, and several others which I shall speak to in their Order: And if it be otherwise at this Time, with some other Towns, which are lately encreas'd in Trade and Navigation, Wealth, and People, while their Neighbours decay, it is because they have some particular Trade, or accident to Trade, which is a kind of <HI>Nostrum</HI> to them, inseparable to the Place, and which fixes there by the Nature of the Thing; as the Her∣ring-Fishery to Yarmouth; the Coal-Trade to New-Castle; the Leeds Cloath∣ing-Trade; the export of Butter and Lead, and the great Corn-Trade for Hol∣land, is to Hull; the Virginia and West India Trade at Liverpool; the Irish Trade at Bristol, and the like: Thus the War has brought a flux of Business and People, and consequently of Wealth, to several Places, as well as to Portsmouth, Chatham, Plymouth, Falmouth, and o∣thers; and were any Wars like those, to continue 20 Years with the Dutch, or any Nation whose Fleets lay that way, as the Dutch do, it would be the like, perhaps, at Ipswich in a few Years, and at other Places on the same Coast.</P>
<P>But at this present Time an Occasion offeers to speak in favour of this Port; namely, the Greenland Fishery, lately proposed to be carry'd on by the South-Sea Company: On which Account I may freely advance this, without any Compliment to to the Town of Ipswich, no Place in Britain▪ is equally quallified like Ipswich▪ whether we respect the Cheapness of building and fitting out their Ships and Shalloups; also furnish∣ing, victualling and providing them with all kind of Stores; convenience for laying up the Ships after the Voyage; room for erecting their Magazines, Ware Houses, Rope-Walks, Cooperages, &amp;c. on the easiest Terms; and especial∣ly for the noisome Cookery, which at∣tends the boiling their Blubber, which may be on this River (as it ought to be) remote from any Places of resort; then their nearness to the Market for the Oil when 'tis made; and which a∣bove all, ought to be the chief thing considered in that Trade, the easiness of their putting out to Sea when they be∣gin their Voyage, in which the same Wind that carries them from the Mouth of the Haven, is fair to the very Seas of Greenland.</P>
<P>I could say much more to this Point, if it were needful, and in few Words could easily prove, that Ipswich must have the preference of all the Port-Towns of Britain, for being the best Center of the Greenland Trade, if ever that Trade fall into the Management of such a People as perfectly understand, and have a due honest regard to its be∣ing managed with the best Husbandry, and to the Prosperity of the Undertak∣ing in general: But whether, we shall e∣ver arrive at so happy a Time, as to re∣cover so useful a Trade to our Country, which our Ancestors had the Honour to be the first Undertakers of, and which has been lost only thro' the Indolence of others, and the encreasing Vigilance of our Neighbours, that is not my Business here to dispute.</P>
<P>What I have said, is only to let the World see, what improvement this Town and Port is capable of: I cannot think, but that providence, which made nothing in vain, cannot have reserv'd so useful, so convenient a Port to lie vacant in the World; but that the Time will some time or other come (especially consider∣ing the improving Temper of the pre∣sent Age) when some peculiar beneficial Business may be found out, to make the Port of Ipswich as useful to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Town as flourishing, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="29"/>
ture has made it proper and capable to be.</P>
<P>As for the Town, it is true, it is but Thinly inhabited, in comparison of the Extent of it; but to say, there are hardly any People to be seen there, is far from be∣ing true in Fact; and whoever thinks fit to look into the Churches and Meeting-Houses on a Sunday, or other publick Days, will find there are very great Num∣bers of people there: Or if he thinks fit to view the Market; and see how the large Shambles, call'd Cardinal Wolsey s Butchery, are furnish'd with Meat, and the rest of the Market stock'd with other Provisions must acknowledge that it is not for a few People that all those Things are provided: A Person very Curious, and on whose Veracity I think I may depend, going thro' the Market in this Town, told me, that he rec∣koned upwards of 600 Country People on Horseback and on Foot, with Bas∣kets and other Carriage, who had all of them brought something or other to Town to sell, besides the Butchers, and what came in Carts and Waggons.</P>
<P>It happen'd to be my Lot to be once at this Town at the time when a very fine new Ship, which was built there, for some Merchants of London, was to be launched; and if I may give my guess at the Numbers of People which appeared on the Shore, in the Houses, and on the River, I believe I am much within Compass, if I say there were 20,000 People to see it; but this is only a Guess, or they might come a great way to see the Sight, or the Town may be declin'd farther since that: But a View of the Town is one of the surest Rules for a gross Estimate.</P>
<P>It is true, here is no settled Manu∣facture: The French Refugees, when they first came over to England, began a little to take to this Place, and some Mer∣chants attempted to set up a Linnen Manu∣facture in their favour; but it has not met with so much Success as was expected, and at present I find very little of it. The poor people are however employ'd as they are all over these Counties, in spin∣ning Wool for other Towns where Manu∣factures are settled.</P>
<P>The Country round Ipswich, as are all the Counties so near the Coast, is applied chiefly to Corn, of which a very great Quantity is continually ship∣ped off for London; and sometimes they load Corn here for Holland, espe∣cially if the Market abroad is encourag∣ing They have 12 Parish-Churches in this Town, with three or four Meet∣ings; but there are not so many Quakers here as at Colchester, and no Anabap∣tists, or Anti-poedo Baptists, that I could hear of, at least there is no Meeting-house of that Denomination: There is one Meeting-House for the Presbyteri∣ans, one for the Independants, and one for the Quakers; the first is as large and as fine a Building of that kind as most on this side of England, and the inside the best finished of any I have seen, Lon∣don excepted; that for the Indepen∣dants is a handsome new-built Building, but not so gay, or so large as the other.</P>
<P>There is a great deal of very good Company in this Town; and tho' there are not so many of the Gentry here as at Bury, yet there are more here than in auy other Town in the County; and I observ'd particularly, that the Company you meet with here, are generally per∣sons well informed of the World, and who have something very solid and entertaining in their Society: This may happen, perhaps, by their frequent con∣versing with those who have been abroad, and by their having a Remnant of Gen∣tlemen and Masters of Ships among them, who have seen more of the World than the people of an Inland Town are likely to have seen. I take this Town to be one of the most agreeable places in England, for Families who have liv'd well, but may have suffered in our late Calamities of Stocks and Bubbles, to retreat to, where they may live within their own Compass; and several things indeed recommend it to such;</P>
<P N="1">1. Good Houses at very easie Rents.</P>
<P N="2">2. An airy, clean, and well-govern'd Town.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="30"/>
3. Very agreeable and improving Com∣pany almost of every Kind.</P>
<P N="4">4. A wonderful plenty of all manner of Provisions, whether Flesh or Fish, and very Good of the Kind.</P>
<P N="5">5 Those Provisions very Cheap; so that a Family may live cheaper here, than in any Town in England of its bigness, within such a small distance from London.</P>
<P N="6">6. E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sie Passage to London, either by Land or Water, the Coach going through to London in a Day.</P>
<P>The Lord Viscount Hereford, has a very fine Seat and Park in this Town; the House indeed is old built, but very commodious; 'tis call'd Christ Church, having been as 'tis said, a Priory, or Re∣ligious House in former Times: The Green and Park is a great addition to the Pleasantness of this Town, the Inhabi∣tants being allowed to divert themselves there with Walking, Bowling, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The large Spire Steeple which former∣ly stood upon that they call the Tower Church, was blown down by a great Storm of Wind many Years ago, and in its Fall did much damage to the Church.</P>
<P>The Government of this Town is by two Bailiffs, as at Yarmouth: Mr. Cam∣den says they are chosen out of twelve Burgesses called Portmen, and two Justi∣ces out of twenty four more. There has been lately a very great Struggle between the two Parties for the choice of these two Magistrates, which had this amicable Conclusion, namely, that they chose one of either side; so that neither Party ha∣ving the Victory, 'tis to be hoped it may be a Means to allay the Heats and un-neighbourly Feuds, which such things breed in Towns so large as this is They send two Members to Parliament, where∣o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those at this time, are Sir William Thompson, Recorder of London, and Colonel Negus, Deputy-Master of the Horse to the King.</P>
<P>There are some Things very curious to be seen here, however some superficial Writers have been ignorant of them. Dr. Beeston, an emi ent Physician, be∣gan, a few Years ago, a Physick Gar∣den adjoining to his House in this Town, and as he is parcularly Curious, and as I was told, exquisitely skill'd in Botanick Knowledge, so he has been not only very diligent, but successful too, in ma∣king a Collection of rare and exotick Plants, such as are scarce to be equall'd in England.</P>
<P>One M. White, a Surgeon, resides also in this Town: But before I speak of this gentleman, I must observe, that I say nothing from Personal Knowledge; tho' if I did, I have too good an Opi∣nion of his Sense to believe he would be pleased with being flattered, or compli∣mented in Print; but I must be true to matter of Fact: This Gentleman has be∣gun a Collection, or Chamber of Rarities, and with good Success too. I acknow∣ledge I had not the Opportunity of seeing them: But I was told there are some things very Curious in it, as particu∣larly a Sea Horse carefully preserv'd, and perfect in all its Parts; two Roman URNS full of Ashes of Human Bodies, and supposed to be above 1700 Years old; besides a great many valuable Me∣dals, and ancient Coins. My Friend who gave me this Account, and of whom I think I may say he speaks without Byass, mentions this Gentleman, Mr. White, with some Warmth, as a very valuable Person in his particular Employ, of a Surgeon, I only repeat his Words: <Q>“Mr. White, says he, to whom the whole Town and Country are greatly in∣debted and obliged to pray for his Life, is our most skilfull Surgeon.”</Q> These I say are his own Words, and I add nothing to them but this, that 'tis happy for a Town to have such a Sur∣geon, as it is for a Surgeon to have such a Character.</P>
<P>The Country round Ipswich, as if qualify'd on purpose to accommodate the Town for building of Ships, is an inexhaustable Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-House of Timber, of which now their Trade of building Ships is abated, they send very great Quanti∣ties to the King's Building-yards at Chat∣ham, which by Water is so little a way, that they often run to it, from the Mouth
<PB REF="31"/>
of the River at Harwich, in one Tide.</P>
<P>From Ipswich I took a Turn into the Country to Hadley, principally to satis∣fy my Curiosity, and see the Place where that famous Martyr and Pattern of Cha∣rity and Religious Zeal in Queen Mary's Time, Dr. Rowland Taylor, was put to Death; the Inhabitants, who have a wonderful Veneration for his Memory, shew the very Place where the Stake which he was bound to was set up, and they have put a Stone upon it, which no body will remove; but it is a more lasting Monument to him, that he lives in the Hearts of the People; I say, more lasting than a Tomb of Marble would bee, for the Memory of that good Man will certainly never be out of the poor People's Minds, as long as this Island shall retain the Protestant Religion a∣momong them; how long that may be, as things are going, and if the detesta∣ble Conspiracy of the Papists now on Foot, should succeed, I will not pretend to say.</P>
<P>A little to the left is Sudbury, which stands upon the River Stour, mentioned above; a River which parts the Coun∣ties of Suffolk and Essex, and which is within these few Years made Navigable to this Town, tho' the Navigation does not (it seems) answer the Charge, at least not to Advantage.</P>
<P>I know nothing for which this Town is remarkable, except for being very Po∣pulous and very Poor. They have a great Manufacture of Says and Perpetu∣ana's; and multitudes of poor People are employ'd in working them; but the Number of the Poor is almost ready to eat up the Rich: However, this Town sends two Members to Parliament, tho' it is under no form of Government par∣ticularly to itself, other than as a Vil∣lage, the Head Magistrate whereof is a Constable.</P>
<P>Near adjoining to it, is a Village cal∣led Long-Melfort, and a very long one it is, from which I suppose it had that addition to its Name; it is full of very good Houses, and, as they told me, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icher, and has more wealthy Masters of the Manufacture in it, than in Sud∣bury itself.</P>
<P>Here, and in the Neighbourhood, are some ancient Families of good Note; particularly here is a fine Dwelling, the ancient Seat of the Cordells, whereof Sir William Cordell was Master of the Rolls in the Time of Queen Elizabeth; but the Family is now extinct; the last Heir, Sir John Cordell, being killed by a Fall from his Horse, died unmarry'd, leaving three Sisters, Co-heireffes to a very noble Estate, most of which, if not all, is now center'd in the only surviving Sister and with her, in Marriage, is gi∣ven to Mr. Firebrass, eldest Son of Sir Basil Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebrass, formerly a flourishing Merchant in London, but reduc'd by many Disasters. His Family now rises by the good Fortune of his Son, who proves to be a Gentleman of very agree∣able Parts, and well esteemed in the Country.</P>
<P>From this part of the Country I return∣ed North West by Lenham, to visit St. Edmund's Bury, a Town of which other Writers have talk'd very largely, and perhaps a little too much. It is a Town fam'd for its pleasant Situation and whol∣some Air, the Montpelier of Suffolk, and perhaps of England; this must be attributed to the Skill of the Monks of those Times, who chose so beautiful a Situation for the Seat of their Retire∣ment; and who built here the greatest and, in its Time, the most flourishing Monastery in all these Parts of England, I mean the Monastery of St. Edmund the Martyr: It was, if we believe Antiqui∣ty, a House of Pleasure in more ancient Times; or to speak more properly, a Court of some of the Saxon or East-An∣gle Kings; and, as Mr. Camden says, was even then called a Royal Village▪ tho' it much better merits that Name now; it being the Town of all this Part of England, in proportion to its bigness▪ most thronged with Gentry, People of the best Fashion, and the most polite Conversation: This beauty and healthi∣ness of its Situation, was, no doubt, the Occasion which drew the Clergy to settle
<PB REF="32" MS="y"/>
here, for they always chose the best Places in the Country to build in, either for richness of Soil, or for Health and Pleasure, in the Situation of their Reli∣gious Houses.</P>
<P>For the like Reason, I doubt not, they translated the Bones of the Martyr'd King St. Edmund, to this Place; for it is a vulgar Error to say, he was mur∣thered here; his Martyrdom, it is plain, was at Hoxon or Henilsdon, near Harl∣ston, on the Wavenry, in the farthest Northern Verge of the County; but Se∣gebert, King of the East Angles, had built a religious House in this pleasant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Part of the County; and as the Monks began to taste the Pleasure of the Place they procured the Body of this Saint to be removed hither, which soon encreased the Wealth and Revenues of their House, by the Zeal of that Day, in going on Pilgrimage to the Shrine of the blessed St. Edmund.</P>
<P>We read however, that after this, the Danes under King Sweno, over-running this part of the Country, destroy'd this Monastery and burnt it to the Ground, with the Church and Town: But see the Turn Religion gives to Things in the World, his Son, King Canutus, at first a Pagan and a Tyrant, and the most cruel Ravager of all that Crew, coming to turn Christian; and being touch'd in Conscience for the Soul of his Father, in having robb'd God, and his Holy Mar∣tyr St. Edmund, sacrilegiously destroying the Church, and plundering the Mona∣stery; I say, touch'd with Remorse, and as the Monks pretend, terrify'd with a Vision of St. Edmund appearing to him, he rebuilt the House, the Church, and the Town also, and very much added to the Wealth of the Abbot and his Fra∣ternity, offering his Crown at the Feet of St. Edmund, giving the House to the Monks, Town and ill; so that they were absolute Lords of the Town, and govern∣ed it, by their Steward, for many Ages. He also gave them a great many good Lordships, which they enjoyed till the general Suppression of Abbies, in the Time of Henry VIII.</P>
<P>But I am neither writing the History, or searching the Antiquity, of the Ab∣bey, or Town, my Business is the pre∣sent State of the Place.</P>
<P>The Abbey is demolish'd; its Ruins are all that is to be seen of its Glory: Out of the old Building, two very beau∣tiful Churches are built, and serve the two Pari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, into which the Town is divided, and they stand both in one Church, yard. Here it was, in the Path∣way between these two Churches, that a Tragical and almost unheard of Act of Barbarity was committed, which made the Place less pleasant for some Time, than it us'd to be, when Arundel Coke, Esq; a Barrister at Law, of a very an∣cient Family, attempted, with the As∣sistance of a barbarous Assassin, to Mur∣ther in cold Blood, and in the Arms of Hospitality, Edward Crisp, Esq; his Bro∣ther-in-Law, leading him out from his own House, where he had invited him, his Wife and Children, to Supper; I say, leading him out in the Night▪ on pre∣tence of going to see some Friend that that was known to them both; but in this Church-yard, giving a Signal to the Assassin he had hired, he attack'd him with a Hedge-Bill, and cut him, as one might say, almost in Pieces, and when they did not doubt of his being Dead, they left him: His Head and Face was so mangled, that it may be said to be next to a Miracle that he was not quite killed: Yet so Providence directed for the exemplary Punishment of the Assas∣sins, that the Gentleman recover'ed to detect them, who (tho' he out-lived the Assault) were both Executed, as they deserv'd, and Mr. Crisp is yet alive. They were Condemned on the Statute for Defacing and Dismembring, called the Coventry Act.</P>
<P>But this Accident does not at all les∣sen the Pleasure and agreeable delightful shew of the Town of Bury; it is croud∣ed with Nobility and Gentry, and all Sorts of the most agreeable Company; and as the Company Invites, so there is the Appearance of Pleasure upon the Situation; and those that live at Bury,
<PB REF="33"/>
are supposed to live there for the sake of it.</P>
<P>The Lord Jermin, afterwards Lord Dover, and since his Lordship's Decease, Sir Robert Davers, enjoy'd the most delicious Seat of Rushbrook, near this Town.</P>
<P>The present Members of Parliament for this Place are, Jermyn Davers, and James Reynolds, Esqrs.</P>
<P>Mr. Harvey, afterwards created Lord Harvey, by King William, and since that, made Earl of Bristol by King George, liv'd many Years in this Town, leav∣ing a noble and pleasantly situated House in Lincolnshire, for the more agreeable living on a Spot so compleatly quali∣fied for a Life of Delight as this of Bury.</P>
<P>The Duke of Graston, now Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, has also a stately House at Euston, near this Town, which he enjoys in Right of his Mother, Daugh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to the Earl of Arlington, one of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ministers of State in the Reign of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g Charles II. and who made the second Letter in the Word CABAL; a Word form'd by that famous Sati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rest Andrew Marvell, to represent the five Heads of the Politicks of that time, as the Word SMECTYMNUS was on a former Occasion.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of this Town consists in the number of Gentry who dwell in and near it, the Polite Conversation among them, the Affluence and Plenty they live in; the sweet Air they breathe in, and the pleasant Country they have to go abroad in.</P>
<P>Here is no Manufacturing in this Town, or but very little, except Spinning; the chief Trade of the Place depending up∣on the Gentry who live there, or near it, and who cannot fail to cause Trade enough by the Expence of their Families and Equipages, among the People of a County Town. They have but a very small River, or rather but a very small Branch of a small River, at this Town, which runs from hence to Milden-Hall, on the edge of the Fens. However▪ the Town and Gentlemen about, have been at the Charge, or have so encourag'd the Engineer who was at the Charge, that they have made this River Navigable to the said Milden-Hall, from whence there is a Navigable Dyke, call'd Milden-Hall Dreyn, which goes into the River Ouse, and so to Lynn; so that all their Coal and Wine, Iron, Lead, and other heavy Goods, are brought by Water from Lynn, or from London, by the way of Lynn to the great Ease of the Tradesmen.</P>
<P>This Town is famous for two great Events: One was that in the Year 1447, in the 25th Year of Henry the VIth, a Parliament was held here.</P>
<P>The other was, That at the Meeting of this Parliament, the Great Humphry, Duke of Glocester, Regent of the King∣dom, during the Absence of King Hen y the Vth, and the Minority of Henry the VIth, and to his last Hour, the Safeguard of the whole Nation, and Darling of the People, was basely murdered here; by whose Death, the Gate was opened to that dreadful War between the Houses of Lancaster and York, which ended in the Confusion of that very Race, who are supposed to have contrived the murder</P>
<P>From St. Edmund's Bury I returned by Stow-Market and Needham, to Ips∣wich, that I might keep as near the Coast as was proper to my design'd Cir∣cuit or Journey; and from Ipswich, to visit the Sea again, I went to Wood∣bridge, and from thence to Orford, on the Sea-side.</P>
<P>Woodbridge has nothing remarkable, but that it a considerable Market for But∣ter and Corn to be exported to London; for now begins that Part which is or∣dinarily called High Suffolk; which be∣ing a rich Soil, is for a long tract of ground, wholly employed in Daries; and they again famous for the best Butter, and per∣haps the worst Cheese, in England: The Butter is Barrelled, or often pickled up in small Casks, and sold, not in London only, but I have known a Firkin of Suf∣folk Butter sent to the West Indies, and brought back to England again, and has been perfectly Good and Sweet, as at first.</P>
<P>The Port for the Shipping off their Suffolk Butter is chiefly Woodbridge,
<PB REF="34" MS="y"/>
which for that Reason is full of Corn-Factors, and Butter-Factors, and some of whom are very considerable Mer∣chants.</P>
<P>From hence turning down to the shore, we see Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord Ness, a noted Point of Land for the Guide of the Colliers and Coasters, and a good shelter for them to ride under, when a strong North-East Wind blows and makes a foul Shoar on the Coast.</P>
<P>South of the Ness is orfo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Haven, be∣ing the Mouth of two little Rivers meet∣ing together; 'tis a very good Harbour fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Vessels, but not capable of re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eiving a Ship of Burthen.</P>
<P>Orford was once a good Town, but is decay'd, and as it stands on the Land∣side of the River, the Sea daily throws up more Land to it, and falls off i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om it, as if it was resolved to disown the Place, and that it should be a Sea-Port no longer.</P>
<P>A little farther lies Albro', as thriv∣ing, tho' without a Port, as the other is decaying, with a good River in the Front of it.</P>
<P>There are some Gentlemen's Seats up far her f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the Sea, but very few upon the Coast.</P>
<P>From Albro' to Dunwich, there are no Towns of Note; even this Town seems to be in Danger of being swallow∣ed up; for Fame reports, that once they had fifty Churches in the Town; I saw but one left, and that not hal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> full of People.</P>
<P>This Town is a Testimony of the decay of publick Things▪ Things of the most durable Nature; and as the old Poet expresses it:
<Q><L>By numerous Examples we may see,</L>
<L>That Towns and Cities Die, as well as we.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Ruins of Carthage, of the great City of Jerusalem, or of antient Rome are not at all Wonderful to me; the Ruins of Ninev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, which are so en∣tirely sunk, as that 'tis doubt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul where the City stood: The Ruins of Babylon, or the Great Persepolis, and many Capital Cities, which Time and the Change of Monarchies have Overthrown; these, I say, are not all Wonderful, be∣cause being the Capitals of great and flourishing Kingdoms, where those King∣doms were Overthrown, the Capital Cities necessarily sell with them: But for a private Town, a Sea-Port, and a Town of Commerce, to decay, as it were of itself (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or we never read of Dunwich being plundered, or ruin'd, by any Disaster, at least not of late Years); this I must confess, seems ow∣ing to nothing but to the Fate of Things, by which we see that Towns, Kings, Countries Families, and Persons, have all their Elevation, their Medium, their Declination, and even their Destruction in the Womb of Time, and the Course of Nature. It is true, this Town is ma∣nifestly decayed by the invasion of the Waters, and as other Towns seem suf∣ferers by the Sea, or the Tide withdraw∣ing from their Ports, such as Orford, just now named; Winchelsea and Kent, and the like: So this Town is, as it were, eaten up by the Sea, as above; and the still encroaching Ocean seems to threa∣ten it with a fatal Immersion in a few Years more.</P>
<P>Yet Dunwich, however ruin'd, retains some share of Trade, as particularly for the shipping off Butter, Cheese, and Corn, which is so great a Business in this County, that it employs a great ma∣ny People and Ships al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o; and this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort lies right against the particular part of the County for Butter, as to Framling∣ham, Halsted, &amp;c. Also a very great Quantity of Corn is bought up here-about for the London Market; for I shall still touch that Point, how all the Counties in England contribute something towards the Subsistence of the Great City of London, of which the Butter here is a very considerable Article; as also coar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Cheese, which I mention'd before, us'd chiefly.</P>
<P>Hereabouts they begin to talk of Herrings and the Fishery; and we find in the ancient Records that the Town, which was then equal to a la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge City▪
<PB REF="35" MS="y"/>
paid, among other Tribute to the Go∣vernment, 50000 of Herrings. Here also, and at Swole, or Southole, the next Seaport, they Cure Sprats in the same manner as they do Herrings at Yarmouth; that is to say, speaking in their own Language, they make red Sprats; or to speak good English, they make Sprats red.</P>
<P>It is Remarkable, that this Town is now so much washed away by the Sea, that what little Trade they have, is car∣ry'd on by Walderswick, a little Town near Swole, the Vessels coming in there, because the Ruins of Dunwich make the Shore there unsafe to the Boats, from whence the Northern Coasting Seamen, a rude Verse of their own using, and I suppose of their own making; as follows,
<Q><L>Swoul and Dunwich, and Walderswick,</L>
<L>All go in at one lousie Creek.</L></Q>
This lousie Creek, in short, is a little River at Swoul, which our late famous Atlas-maker calls a good Harbour for Ships, and Rendezvous of the Royal Navy; but that by the bye; the Author, it seems, knew no better.</P>
<P>From Dunwich, we came to South∣wold, the Town above-named; this is a small Port-Town upon the Coast, at the Mouth of a little River call'd the Bli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h: I found no Business the People here were employ'd in, but the Fishery, as above, for Herrings and Sprats; which they Cure by the help of Smoak, as they do at Yarmouth.</P>
<P>There is but one Church in this Town, but it is a very large one and well built, as most of the Churches in this County are, and of impenetrable Flint; indeed there is no Occasion for its being so large, for staying there one Sabbath-Day, I was surprized to see an extraordinary large Church, capable of receiving five or six thousand People, and but Twenty seven in it besides the Parson and the Clerk; but at the same Time, the Meeting-house of the Dissenters was full to the very Doors, having, as I guess'd, from 6 to 800 People in it.</P>
<P>This Town is made famous for a very great Engagement at Sea, in the Year 1672, between the English and Dutch Fleets, in the Bay opposite to the Town; in which, not to be partial to ourselves, the English Fleet was worsted; and the brave Montague Earl of Sandwich, Ad∣miral under the Duke of Y ork, lost his Life: The Ship Royal Prince, carrying 100 Guns, and which was, under him, commanded by Sir Edward Spragg, was Burnt, and several other Ships loft, and about 600 Seamen; part of those killed in the Fight were, as I was told, brought on Shore here and buried in the Church∣yard of this Town, as others also were at Ipswich.</P>
<P>At this Town in particular, and so at all the Towns on this Coast from Orford-Ness to Yarmouth, is the ordinary Place where our Summer Friends the Swallows, first Land when they come to visit us; and here they may be said to embark for their Return▪ when they go back into warmer Climates; and, as I think the following Remark, tho' of so trifling a Circumstance, may be both Instructing as well as Diverting, it may be very pro∣per in this Place. The Case is this, I was some Years before at this Place, at the latter end of the Year, viz about the beginning of October, and in a House that looked into the Church-yard, I ob∣serv'd, in the Evening, an unusual mul∣titude of Birds sitting on the Leads of the Church; Curiosity led me to go near∣er to see what they were, and I found they were all Swallows; that there was such an infinite Number that they cover∣ed the whole Roof of the Church, and of several Houses near, and perhaps might of more Houses which I did not see; this led me to enquire of a grave Gentleman whom I saw near me, what the Meaning was of such a prodigious Multitude of Swallows sitting there? O Sir, says he, turning towards the Sea, you may see the Reason, the Wind is off Sea. I did not seem fully informed by that Expression; so he goes on: I perceive, Sir, says he, you are a Stran∣ger to it; you must then understand,
<PB REF="36"/>
first, that this is the Season of the Year when the Swallows, their Food here fail∣ing, begin to leave us, and return to the Country, where-ever it be, from whence I suppose they came; and this being the nearest to the Coast of Holland, they come here to Embark; this he said Smi∣ling a little; and now Sir, says he, the Weather being too calm, or the Wind contrary, they are waiting for a Gale, for they are all Wind-bound.</P>
<P>This was more evident to me, when in the Morning I found the Wind had come about to the North-west in the Night, and there was not one Swallow to be seen, of near a Million, which I be∣lieve was there the Night before.</P>
<P>How those Creatures know that this Part of the Island of Great-Britain is the Way to their Home, or the way that they are to go; that this very Point is the nearest Cut over, or even that the near∣est Cut is best for them, that we must leave to the Naturalists to determin, who insist upon it, that Brutes cannot Think.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the Swallows nei∣ther come hither for warm Weather, nor retire from Cold, the thing is of quite a∣nother Nature; they, like the shoals of Fish in the Sea, pursue their Prey; they are a voracious Creature, they feed fly∣ing; their Food is found in the Air, viz. the Insects; of which in our Summer Evenings, in damp and moist Places, the Air is full; they come hither in the Sum∣mer, because our Air is fuller of Fogs and Damps than in other Countries, and for that Reason, feeds great Quantities of Insects, if the Air be hot and dry, the Gnats die of themselves, and even the Swallows will be found famish'd for Want, and fall down dead out of the Air, their Food being taken from them: In like manner, when cold Weather comes in, the Insects all die, and then of Necessity, the Swallows quit us, and fol∣low their Food where-ever they go, this they do in the manner I have men∣tioned above; for sometimes they are seen to go off in vast Flights like a Cloud; and sometimes again, when the Wind grows fair, they go away a few and a few, as they come, not staying at all up∣on the Coast.</P>
<P>Note, This passing and repassing of the Swallows, is observ'd no where so much, that I have heard of, or in but few other Places, except on this Eastern Coast; namely, from above Harwich to the East Point of Norfolk, called Win∣terton Ness North; which is all right against Holland, we know nothing of them any farther North, the Passage of the Sea being, as I suppose, too broad from Flambro' Head, and the Shoar of Holderness in Yorkshire, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I find very little remarkable on this side of Suffolk, but what is on the Sea-Shoar as above; the Inland Country is that which they properly call High <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> folk, and is full of rich feeding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and large Farms, mostly employ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dayries for making the Suffolk <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Cheese, of which I have spoken <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ready: Among these rich Grounds, stand some Market-Towns, tho' not of very considerable Note▪ such as Framlingham, where was once a Royal Castle, to which Queen Mary retir'd, when the Northumberland Fraction, in behalf of the Lady Jane, endeavoured to supplant her: and it was this part of Suffolk where the Gospellers, as they were then called, prefer'd their Loyalty to their Religion, and complimented the Popish Line at Expence of their Share of the Reformation; but they paid dear for it, and their Successors have learned better Politicks since.</P>
<P>In these Parts are also feveral good Market-Towns, some in this County, and some in the other, as Becles, Bun∣gay, Harlston &amp;c. all on the Edge of the River Waveney, which parts here the Counties of Suffolk and Norfolk: And here in a Bye-Place, and out of Common Remark, lies the antient Town of Hoxon, famous for being the Place where St. Edmund was mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, for whom so many Cells and Shrines have been set up, and Monasteries built; and in Honour of whom, the famous Monas∣tery of St. Edmund's Bury above-men∣tioned,
<PB REF="37" MS="y"/>
tioned, was Founded, which most Peo∣ple erroneously think was the Place where the said Murder was committed.</P>
<P>Besides the Towns mention'd above, there are Halesworth, Saxmundham, De∣benham, Aye, or Eye, all standing in this Eastern side of Suffolk; in which, as I have said, the whole Country is employ'd in Dairies, or in feeding of Cattle.</P>
<P>This part of England is also remark∣ble for being the first where the feeding and fattening of Cattle, both Sheep as well as black Cattle with Turnips, was first Practis'd in Edgland, which is made a very great part of the Improvement of their Lands on this Day; and from whence the Practice is spread over most of the East and South Parts of England, to the great Enriching of the Farmers, and encrease of sat Cattle: And tho' some have objected against the good∣ness of the Flesh thus fed with Turnips, and have fansied it would taste of the Root, yet upon Experience itis found, that at Market there is no difference nor can they that buy, single out one Joynt of Mutton from another by the Taste: So that the Complaint which our nice Palates are first made, begins to cease of itself, and a very great Quan∣tity of Bees, and Mutton also, is brought every Year, and every Week to Lon∣don, from this side of England, and much more than was formerly known to be sed there.</P>
<P>I can't omit, however little it may seem, that this County of Suffolk is par∣ticularly famous for furnishing the City of London, and all the Counties round, with Turkeys, and that 'tis thought, there are more Turkeys bred in this County, and the Part of Norfolk that adjoins to it, than in all the rest of England, especially for Sale; tho' this may be rec∣kon'd, as I say above, but a trifling thing to take notice of in these Remarks; yet, as I have hinted, that I shall observe, how London is in general supplied with all its Provisions from the whole Body of the Nation, and how every Part of the Island is engaged in some degree or other of that Supply: On this Account I could not omit it; nor will it be found so inconsider∣able an Article as some may imagine, if this be true which I receiv'd an account of from a Person living on the Place, (viz.) That they have counted 300 Droves of Turkeys (for they drive them all in Droves on Foot) pass in one Season over Stratford-Bridge on the River Stour, which parts Suffolk from Essex, about six Miles from Colchester, on the Road from Ipswich to London. These Droves, as they say, generally contain from three Hundred to a Thousand each Drove; so that one may suppose them to contain 500 one with another, which is 150000 in all; and yet this is one of the least Passages, the Numbers which travel by New Market-Heath, and the open Coun∣try and the Forest; and also the Numbers that come by Sudbury, and Clare being many more.</P>
<P>For the further Supplies of the Markets of London with Poultry, of which these Countries particularly abound: They have within these few Years found it practica∣ble to make the Geese Travel on Foot too, as well as the Turkeys; and a pro∣digious Number are brought up to Lon∣don in Droves from the farthest Parts of Norfolk; even from the Fenn Country, about Lynn, Downham, Wiesbich, and the Washes; as also from all the East-side of Norfolk and Suffolk, of whom 'tis very frequent now to meet Droves, with a Thousand, sometimes two Thousand in a Drove: They begin to drive them ge∣nerally in August, by which time the Harvest is almost over, and the Geese may feed in the Stubbles as they go. Thus they hold on to the end of October, when the Roads begin to be too stiff and deep for their broad Feet and short Legs to march in.</P>
<P>Besides these Methods of driving these Creatures on Foot, they have of late also invented a new Method of Cariage, be∣ing Carts form'd on purpose, with four Sto∣ries or Stages, to put the Creatures in one above another, by which Invention one Cart will carry a very great number; and for the smother going, they drive with two Horses a-breast, like a Coach, so quartering the Road for the Ease of the Gentry that
<PB REF="38" MS="y"/>
thus ride; changing Horses they travel Night and Day: so that they bring the Fowls 70, 80, or 100 Miles in two Days and one Night: The Horses in this new∣fashion'd Voiture go two a-Breast, as above, but no Perch below as in a Coach, but they are fasten'd together by a piece of Wood lying Cross-wise upon their Necks, by which they are kept even and together▪ and the Driver sits on the Top of the Cart, like as in the publick Car∣riages for the Army, &amp;c</P>
<P>In this manner they hurry away the Creatures alive, and infinite Numbers are thus carried to London every Year. This Method is also particular for the carrying young Turkeys, or Turkey-poults in their Season, which are Valuable, and yield a good Price at Market; as also for live Chickens in the dear Seasons; of all which a very great Number are brought in this manner to London, and more prodigious∣ly out of this Country than any other part of England, which is the Reason of my speaking of it here.</P>
<P>In this Part, which we call High Suf∣folk, there are not so many Families of Gentry or Nobility plac'd, as in the other side of the Country: But 'tis observ'd, that tho' their Seats are not so frequent here, their Estates are; and their pleasure of West Suffolk is much of it supported by the Wealth of High Suffolk; for the rich∣ness of the Lands, and application of the People to all kinds of Improvement, is scarce credible; also the Farmers are so very considerable, and their Farmsand Dai∣ries so large, that 'tis very frequent for a Farmer to have a thousand Pounds Stock upon his Farm in Cows also.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NORFOLK.</HEAD>
<P>From High Suffolk, I pass'd the Wave∣ney into Norfolk, near Schole Inn; in my Passage I saw at Redgrave, (the Seat of the Family) a most exquisite Monument of Sir John Holt, Knight, late Lord Chief Justice of the King's-Bench, several Years, and one of the most eminent Law∣yers of his Time. One of the Heirs of the Family is now building a fine Seat about a Mile on the South-side of Ips∣wich, near the Road.</P>

<P>When we come into Norfolk, we see a Face of Diligence spread over the whole Country; the vast Manufactures carry'd on (in chief) by the Norwich Weav∣ers, employs all the Country round in spinning Yarn for them; besides many thousand Packs of Yarn which they receive from other Countries, even from as far as Yorkshire, and Westmoreland, of which I shall speak in its Place.</P>
<P>This side of Norfolk is very populous, and throng'd with great and spacious Market-Towns, more and larger than any other Part of England so far from London, except Devonshire, and the West-riding of Yorkshire; for Example, between the Frontiers of Suffolk and the City of Norwich on this side, which is not above 22 Miles in breadth, are the following Market-Towns, viz. Thet∣ford, Dis, Harling, Bucknam, Hingham, West Deerham, Attleboro', Windham, Harleston, E. Deerham, Watton, Lod∣don, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Most of these Towns are very popu∣lous
<PB REF="39" MS="y"/>
and large; but that which is most remarkable is, that the whole Country round them is so interspers'd with Villa∣ges, and those Villages so large, and so full of People, that they are equal to Market-Towns in other Countries; in a Word, they render this Eastern part of Norfolk exceeding full of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>An eminent Weaver of Norwich, gave me a Scheme of their Trade on this Occasion, by which, calculating from the number of Looms at that time em∣ployed in the City of Norwich only, be∣sides those employ'd in other Towns in the same County, he made it appear ve∣ry plain, that there were 120000 Peo∣ple employ'd in the Woollen and Silk and Wool Manufactures of that City only; not that the People all lived in the City, tho' Norwich is a very large and populous City too: But I say, they were employ'd for spinning the Yarn used for such Goods as were all made in that City. This Acconnt is Curious enough, and very exact, but it is too long for the compass of this Work.</P>
<P>This shews the Wonderful Extent of the Norwich Manufacture, or Stuff-weav∣ing Trade, by which so many thousands of Families are maintained. Their Trade indeed felt a very sensible Decay, and the Cries of the Poor began to be very loud, when the wearing of painted Cal∣licoes was grown to such an height in England, as was seen about two or three Years ago; but an Act of Parliament having been obtained, tho' not with∣out great Struggle, in the Years 1720, and 1721, for prohibiting the use and wearing of Callico's, the Stuff Trade reviv'd incredibly; and as I pass'd this part of the Country in the Year 1723, the Manufacturers assured me, that there was not in all the Eastern and middle part of Norfolk, any Hand unemploy'd, if they would Work; and that the very Children after four or five Years of Age, could every one earn their Bread. But I return to speak of the Villages and Towns in the rest of the County; I shall come to the City of Norwich by it∣self.</P>
<P>This throng of Villages continues thro' all the East part of the Country, which is of the greatest Extent, and where the Manufacture is chiefly carry'd on: If any part of it be waste and thin of Inhabitants, it is the West Part, draw∣ing a Line from about Brand or Bran∣don, South to Walsingham, North. This part of the Country indeed is full of open Plains, and somewhat Sandy and Barren, and feeds great Flocks of good Sheep: But put it all together, the County of Norfolk has the most People in the least Tract of Land of any County in England, except about London, and Ex∣on, and the West-Riding of Yorkshire, as above.</P>
<P>Add to this, that there is no single County in England, except as above, that can boast of three Towns so Popu∣lous, so Rich, and so famous for Trade and Navigation, as in this County: By these three Towns, I mean the City of Norwich, the Towns of Yarmouth and Lynn; besides, that it has several other Sea Ports of very good Trade, as Wisbich, Wells, Burnham, Clye, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Norwich is the Capital of all the County, and the Center of all the Trade and Manufactures which I have just mention'd; an ancient large, rich, and populous City: If a Stranger was only to ride thro' or view the City of Nor∣wich for a Day, he would have much more Reason to think there was a Town without Inhabitants, than there is really to say so of Ipswich; but on the contrary, if he was to view the City, either on a Sabbath-day, or on any publick Occasion, he would wonder where all the People could dwell, the Multitude is so great: But the Case is this: The Inhabitants being all busie at their Manufactures, dwell in their Garrets at their Looms, and in their Combing-shops, so they call them, Twisting Mills, and other Work-Houses; almost all the Works they are employ'd in, being done within Doors. There are in this City thirty-two Pa∣rishes besides the Cathedral, and a great many Meeting-Houses of Dissenters of all Denominations. The publick Edifices
<PB REF="40" MS="y"/>
are chiefly the Castle, antient and de∣cayed, and now for many Years past made use of for a Jayl. The Duke of Norfolk's House was formerly kept well, and the Gardens preserved for the plea∣sure and Diversion of the Citizens, but since feeling too sensibly the sinking cir∣cumstances of that once glorious family, who were the first Peers and Hereditary Earl-Marshals of England.</P>
<P>The Walls of this City are reckon'd three Miles in Circumference, taking in more Ground than the City of London; but much of that Ground lying open in Pasture-fields and Gardens, nor does it seem to be, like some antient places, a decayed declining Town and that the Walls mark out its antient Dimensions; for we do not see Room to suppose that it was ever larger or more populous than it is now: But the Walls seem to be placed, as if they expected that the City would in time encrease sufficiently to fill them up with Buildings.</P>
<P>The Cathedral of this City is a fine Fabrick, and the Spire-Steeple very high and beautiful; it is not antient, the Bish∣op's See having been first at Thetford; from whence it was not translated hither till the Twelfth Century; yet the Church has so many Antiquities in it, that our late great Scholar and Physician, Sir Tho. Brown, thought it worth his while to write a whole Book to collect the mo∣numents and Inscriptions in this Church, to which I refer the Reader.</P>
<P>The River Yare runs through this Ci∣ty, and is navigable thus far without the help of any Art, (that is to say, without Locks or Stops) and being encreas'd by other Waters, passes afterwards thro' a long Tract of the richest Meadows, and the largest, take them altogether, that are any where in England, lying for thirty Miles in length, from this City to Yar∣mouth, including the return of the said Meadows on the Bank of the Wavency South, and on the River Thyrn, North.</P>
<P>Here is one thing indeed strange in it∣self, and more so, in that History seems to be quite ignorant of the Occasion of it. The River Waveney is a considerable Ri∣ver, and of a deep and full Channel, Navigable for large Barges as high as Beccles, it runs for a Course of about fifty Miles, between the two Counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, as a boundary to both, and pushing on, tho' with a gen∣tle Stream, towards the Sea, no one would doubt, but, that when they see the River growing broader and deeper, and going directly towards the Sea, even to the Edge of the Beach; that is to say, within a Mile of the main Ocean; no Stranger, I say, but would expect to see its Entrance into the Sea at that place, and a noble Harbour for Ships at the Mouth of it; when on a sudden, the Land rising high by the Sea-side, crosses the head of the River, like a Dam, checks the whole Course of it, and it returns, bending its Course West, for two Miles, or thereabouts; and then turning North, thro' another long Course of Meadows (joining to those just now mention'd) seeks out the River Yare, that it may join its Water with her's, and find their way to the Sea together.</P>
<P>Some of our Historians tell a long Fa∣bulous Story of this River's being once open, and a famous Harbour for Ships belonging to the Town of Leostof ad∣joining: But that the Town of Yarmouth envying the Prosperity of the said Town of Leostof, made War upon them; and that after many bloody Battles, as well by Sea as by Land, they came at last to a Decisive Action at Sea with their re∣spective Fleets, and the Victory fell to the Yarmouth Men, the Leostof Fleet being Overthrown and uttely destroyed; and that upon this Victory, the Yarmouth Men either actually did stop up the Mouth of the said River, or oblig'd the vanquish'd Leostof Men to do it them∣selves, and bound them never to attempt to open it again.</P>
<P>I believe my share of this Story, and I recommend no more of it to the Reader; adding, that I see no Authority for the Relation, neither do the Relators agree either in the Time of it, or in the Parti∣culars of the Fact; that is to say, in whose reign, or under what Govern∣ment
<PB REF="41"/>
all this happened, in what Year, and the like: So I satisfy myself with transcribing the Matter of Fact, and then leave it as I find it.</P>
<P>In this vast Tract of Meadows are fed a prodigious number of black Cattle, which are said to be sed up for the fat∣test Beef, tho' not the largest in Eng∣land; and the Quantity is so great, as that they not only supply the City of Norwich, the Town of Yarmouth, and County adjacent, but send great Quanti∣ties of them Weekly in all the Winter Season, to London.</P>
<P>And this in particular is worthy Re∣mark, That the gross of all the Scots Cattle which come yearly into England, are brought hither, being brought to a small Village lying North of the City of Norwich, call'd St. Faiths, where the Norfolk Grasiers go and buy them.</P>
<P>These Scotch Runts, so they call them, coming out of the cold and barren Moun∣tains of the Highlands in Scotland, feed so eagerly on the rich Pasture in these Marshes, that they thrive in an unusual manner, and grow monstrously Fat; and the Beef is so delicious for Taste, that the Inhabitants prefer 'em to the Eng∣lish Cattle, which are much larger and fairer to look at, and they may very well do so: Some have told me, and I I believe with good Judgment, that there are above 40,000 of these Scots Cattle sed in this County every Year, and most of them in the said Marshes between Nor∣wich, Beccles, and Yarmouth.</P>
<P>Yarmouth is an antient Town, much older than Norwich; and at present, tho' not standing on so much Ground, yet better built; much more compleat; for number of Inhabitants, not much inferior; and for Wealth, Trade, and advantage of its Situation, superior to Norwich.</P>
<P>It is plac'd on a Peninsula between the River Yare and the Sea; the two last ly∣ing Parallel to one another, and the Town in the middle: The River lies on the West-side of the Town, and being grown very large and deep, by a conflux of all the Rivers on this side the County, forms the Haven; and the Town facing to the West also, and open to the River, makes the finest Key in England, if not in Europe, not inferior even to that of of Marseilles itself.</P>
<P>The Ships ride here so close, and as it were, keeping up one another, with their Head-fasts on Shore, that for half a Mile together, they go cross the Stream with their Bowsprits over the Land, their Bows, or Heads, touching the very Wharf; so that one may walk from Ship to Ship as on a floating Bridge, all along by the Shore-side: The Key reach∣ing from the Draw-Bridge almost to the South Gate, is so spacious and wide, that in some Places 'tis near One hun∣dred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ards f om the Houses to the Wharf. In this pleasant and agreeable range of Houses are some very magnificent Build∣ings, and among the rest, the Custom-House and Town-Hall, and some Mer∣chants Houses, which look like little Pa∣laces, rather than the Dwelling Houses of private Men.</P>
<P>The greatest Defect of this beautiful Town, seems to be, that tho' it is very rich and encreasing in Wealth and Trade, and consequently in People, there is not Room to enlarge the Town by Build∣ing; which would be certainly done much more than it is, but that the River on the Land-side prescribes them, except at the North End without the Gate; and even there the Land is not very agreeable: But had they had a larger Space within the Gates, there would before now, have been many spacious Streets of noble fine Buildings erected, as we see is done in some other thriving Towns in England, as at Liverpool, Man∣chester, Bristol, Frome, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Key and the Harbour of this Town during the Fishing-Fair, as they call it, which is every Michaelmas, one sees the Land cover'd with People, and the River with Barks and Boats, busy Day and Night, laying and carrying off the Herrings, which they catch here in such Quantities, that it is incredible. I happen'd to be there during their Fishing Fair, when I told, in one Tide, 100 and ten Barks and fishing Vessels coming
<PB REF="42"/>
up the River, all loaden with Herrings, and all taken the Night before; and this was besides what was brought on Shore on the Dean, (that is the Seaside of the Town) by open Boats, which they call Cobles, and which often bring in two or three Last of Fish at a time. The Barks often bring in Ten Last a peice.</P>
<P>This Fishing-Fair begins on Michael∣mas day, and lasts all the Month of Octo∣ber, by which time the Herrings draw off to Sea, shoot their Spawn, and are no more fit for the Merchants Business; at least not those that are taken there abouts.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Herrings that are catch'd in this Season are diversly ac∣counted for; some have said, that the Towns of Yarmouth and Leostof only, have taken Forty thousand Last a Season: I will not venture to confirm that Re∣port; but this I have heard the Mer∣chants themselves say, (viz.) That they have Cur'd, that is to say, Hang'd and Dry'd in the Smoak, 40,000 Barrels of merchantable Red-Herrings in one Sea∣son, which is in itself (tho' far short of the other) yet a very considerable Ar∣ticle; and it is to be added, that this is besides all the Herrings consum'd in the Country Towns of both those populous Counties, for thirty Miles from the Sea, whither very great Quantities are carry'd every Tide during the whole Season.</P>
<P>But this is only one Branch of the great Trade carry'd on in this Town: Another Part of this Commerce, is in the exporting these Herrings after they are Cur'd; and for this their Merchants have a great Trade to Genoa, Leghorn, Naples, Messina, and Venice; as also to Spain and Portugal, also exporting with their Herrings very great Quantities of Worsted Stuffs, and Stuffs made of Silk and Worsted; Camblets &amp;c. the Manu∣factures of the neighbouring City of Nor∣wich, and of the Places adjacent.</P>
<P>Besides this, they carry on a very con∣siderable Trade with Holland, whose opposite Neighbours they are; and a vast Quantity of Woollen Manufactures they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Dutch every Year. Also they have a Fishing-Trade to the North-Seas for White Fish, which from the Place are called the North Sea God.</P>
<P>They have also a considerable Trade to Norway, and to the Baltick, from whence they bring back Deals, and Fir-Timber, Oaken Plank Baulks, Sparrs, Oars, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax Spruce Canvas, and Sail-Cloth; with all man∣ner of Navel Stores' which they gene∣rally have a consumption for in their own Port, where they build a very great Number of Ships every Year, besides re∣fitting and repairing the old</P>
<P>Add to this Coal Trade between New∣castle and the River of Thames, in which they are so improv'd of late Years, that they have now a greater share of it than any other Town in England; and have quite work'd the Ipswich Men out of it, who had formerly the chief share of the Colliery in their Hands.</P>
<P>For the carrying on all these Trades, they must have a very great Number of Ships, either of their own, or employ'd by them; and it may in some measure be judg'd of by this, That in the Year 1697, I had an account from the Town Regi∣ster, that there was then 1123 sail of Ships using the Sea, and belong'd to he Town, besides such Ships as the Mer∣chants of Yarmouth might be concern'd in, and be Part-Owners of, belonging to any other Ports.</P>
<P>To all this I must add, without Com∣pliment to the Town, or to the People, that the Merchants, and even the ge∣nerality of Traders of Yarmouth, have a very good Reputation in Trade, as well Abroad as at Home, for Men of fair and honourable Dealing punctual and just in their performing their Engage∣ments, and in discharging Commissions; and their Seamen, as well Masters as Ma∣riners, are justly esteem'd among the ablest and most expert Navigators in England.</P>
<P>This Town however populous and large was ever contained in one Parish, and had but one Church; but within these two Years they have built another very fine Church, near the South-end of the
<PB REF="43"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own. The old Church is dedicated to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. Nicholas, and was built by that fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Bishop of Norwich, William Her∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert, who flourished in the Reign of William II, and Henry I. William of Malmsbury calls him <HI>Vir Pecuniosus;</HI> he might have called him <HI>Vir Pecunio∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>simus,</HI> considering the Times he lived <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and the Works of Charity and Mu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ificence, which he has left as Witnes∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of his immense Riches; for he built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Cathedral Church, the Priory for Sixty Monks, the Bishop's Palace, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Parish-Church of St. Leonard, all in Norwich; this great Church at Yar∣mouth, the Church of St Margaret at Lynn, and of St Mary at Elmham. He removed the Episcopal See from Thet∣ford to Norwich, and instituted the Clu∣niack Monks at Thetford, and gave them, or built them a House. This old Church is very large, and has a high Spire, which is a useful Sea-Mark.</P>
<P>Here is one of the finest Market-pla∣ces, and the best serv'd with Provisions, in England, London excepted, and the Inhabitants are so multiplied in a few Years, that they seem to want room in their Town, rather than People to fill it, as I have observed above.</P>
<P>The Streets are all exactly strait from North to South, with Lanes or Alleys, which they call Rows, crossing them in strait Lines also from East to West; so that it is the most regular built Town in England, and seems to have been built all at once; Or, that the Dimensions of the Houses, aud the Extent of the Streets, were laid out by Consent.</P>
<P>They have particular Priviledges in this Town, and a Jurisdiction by which they can Try, Condemn, and Execute in Especial Cases, without waiting for a Warrant from Above; and this they ex∣erted once very smartly, in Executing a Captain of one of the King's Ships of War, in the Reign of King Charles II, for a Murther committed in the Street, the Circumstance of which did indeed call for Justice, but some thought they would not have ventur'd to exert their Power as they did; however, I never never heard that the Government re∣sented it, or blamed them for it.</P>
<P>It is also a very well overn'd Town and I have no where, in England, ob∣served the Sabbathday so exactly kept, or the Breach so continually punished as in this Place, which I name to their Honour.</P>
<P>Among all these Regularities, it is no Wonder if we do not find abundance of Revelling, or that there is little Encou∣ragement to Assemblies, Plays, and Ga∣ming-Meetings at Yarmouth, as in some other Places; and yet I do not see that the Ladies here come behind any of the neighbouring Counties, either in Beauty, Breeding, or Behaviour; to which may be added too, not at all to their Disad∣vantage, that they generally go beyond them in Fortunes.</P>
<P>From Yarmouth I resolved to pursue my first Design, viz. To view the Sea∣side on this Coast, which is particularly Famous for being one of the most dan∣nerous and most fatal to the Sailors in all England, I may say in all Britain; and the more so, because of the great Number of Ships which are continually going and coming this Way, in their Passage between London and all the Nor∣thern Coasts of Great-Britain. Matters of Antiquity are not my Enquiry, but principally Observations of the present State of Things worthy of Recording, as have never been observed before; and this leads me the more directly to men∣tion the Commerce and the Navigation when I come to Towns upon the Coast, as what few Writers have yet medled with.</P>
<P>The Reason of the Dangers of this particular Coast, are found in the Situa∣tion of the County, and in the Course of Ships failing this way, which I shall describe as well as I can, thus, the Shoar from the Mouth of the River of Thames to Yarmouth Road, lies in a strait Line from S. S. E. to N. N. W. the Land be∣ing on the W. or Larboard Side.</P>
<P>From Winterton Ness, which is the utmost Northerly Point of Land in the County of Norfolk, and about four Miles
<PB REF="44"/>
beyond Yarmouth, the Shoar falls off for near sixty Miles to the West, as far as Lynn and Boston, till the Shoar of Lincolnshire tends North again for about sixty Miles more, as far as the Humber, whence the Coast of Yorkshire, or Hol∣derness, which is the East Riding, shoots out again into the Sea, to the Spurn, and to Flambro' Head, as far East al∣most as the Shoar of Norfolk had given back at Winterton making a very deep Gulph or Bay, between those two Points of Winterton and the Spurn Head; so that the Ships going North, are obliged to stretch away to Sea, from Winterton Ness, and leaving the Sight of Land in that deep Bay which I have mentioned, that reaches to Lynn, and the Shoar of Lincolnshire, they go, I say, N. or still N. N. W. to meet the Shoar of Holder∣ness, which I said runs out into the Sea again at the Spurn, this they leave also, and the first Land they make, or desire to make, is called Flambro' Head; so that Winterton Ness and Flambro' Head, are the two Extremes of this Course, there is, as I said, the Spurn Head in∣deed between; but as it lies too far in towards the Humber, they keep out to the North to avoid coming near it.</P>
<P>In like manner the Ships which come from the North, leave the Shoar at Flam∣bro' Head, and stretch away S. S. E. for Yarmouth Roads; and the first Land they make is Winterton Ness (as above.) Now, the Danger of the Place is this; if the Ships coming from the North are taken with a hard Gale of Wind from the S. E. or from any Point between N. E. and S. E. so that they cannot as the Seamen call it, weather Winterton Ness, they are thereby kept in within that deep Bay, and if the Wind blows hard, are often in Danger of running on Shoar upon the Rocks about Cromer, on the North Coast of Norfolk, or strand∣ing upon the flat Shoar between Cron∣mer and Wells; all the Relief they have is good Ground Tackle to ride it out, which is very hard to do there, the Sea coming very high upon them; or if they cannot ride it out then, to run into the Bottom of the great Bay I mentioned▪ to Lynn, or Boston, which is a very dif∣ficult and desperate Push: So that some∣times, in this Distress, whole Fleets have been lost here all together</P>
<P>The like is the Danger to Ships going Northward, if after passing by Winter∣ton they are taken short with a North-East Wind, and cannot put back into the Roads, which very often happens, then they are driven upon the same Coast▪ and Embay'd just as the latter. The Danger on the North part of this Bay is not the same, because if Ships going or coming should be taken short on this side Flambro', there is the River Humber open to them, and several good Roads to have recourse to, as as Bur∣lington Bay, Grimsby Road, and the Spurn Head, and others, where they ride under shelter.</P>
<P>The Dangers of this Place being thus considered, 'tis no wonder, that upon the Shoar beyond Yarmouth, there are no less than four Light-Houses kept flam∣ing every Night, besides the Lights at Castor, North of the Town, and at Goulston S, all which are to direct the Sailors to keep a good Offing, in Case of bad Weather, and to prevent their running into Cromer Bay, which the Seamen call the Devils Troat.</P>
<P>As I went by Land from Yarmouth Northward, along the Shoar towards Cromer aforesaid, and was not then ful∣ly Master of the Reason of these things, I was surprized to see, in all the Way from Winterton, that the Farmers, and Country People had scarce a Barn, or a Shed, or a Stable, nay, not the Pales of their Yards, and Gardens, not a Hog∣stye, not a necessary-house, but what was built of old Planks, Beams, Wales and Timbers, &amp;c. the wrecks of Ships, and Ruins of Mariners and Merchants fortunes; and in some Places were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole Yards fill'd, and piled up very high with the same Stuff lay'd up, as I supposed, to sell for the like building Purposes, as there should be occasion.</P>
<P>About the year 1692, (I think it was that year) there was a Melancholy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="45"/>
the Mansion of the Family, were not form'd with so much Art in vain, or to to die with the present Possessor.</P>
<P>After this we saw Brently, the Seat of the Earl of Dysert, and the ancient Palace of my Lord Cornwallis, with se∣veral others of exquisite Situation, and adorn'd with the Beauties both of Art and Nature; so that I think, any Tra∣veller from Abroad, who would desire to see how the English Gentry live, and what Pleasures they enjoy, should come into Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, and take but a light Circuit among the Country Seats of the Gentlemen on this side only, and they would be soon con∣vinc'd, that not France, no not Italy it∣self, can out-do them, in Proportion to the Climate they liv'd in.</P>
<P>I had still the County of Cambridge to visit, to compleat this Tour of the Eastern Part of England, and of that I come now to speak.</P>
<P>We enter Cambridgeshire out of Suf∣folk with all the Advantage in the world; the County beginning upon those agree∣able Plains call'd New Market-Heath, where passing the Devil's Ditch, which has nothing worth Notice but its Name, and that but fabulous too, from the Hills call'd Gogmagog, we see a rich and pleasant Vale Westward, cover'd with Corn Fields, Gentlemen's Seats, Villages, and at a Distance, to crown all the rest, that anciently and truly famous Town and University of Cambridge; Capital of the County, and receiving its Name from, if not as some say, giving Name to it; for if it be true, that the Town takes its Name of Cambridge from its Bridge over the River Cam; then certainly the Shire or County, upon the Division of England into Counties had its Name from the Town, and Cam∣bridgeshire signifies no more or less than the County of which Cambridge is the Capital Town.</P>
<P>As my Business is not to lay out the Geographical Situation of Places, I say nothing of the Buttings and Boundings of this County: It lies on the Edge of the great Level, call'd by the People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> if not all the Isle of Ely, lies in this County and Norfolk: The rest of Cam∣bridgeshire is almost wholly a Corn Country; and of that Corn five Parts in six, of all they sow, is Barly, which is generally sold to Ware and Royston, and other great Malting Towns in Hert∣fordshire, and is the Fund from whence that vast Quantity of Malt, call'd Hert∣fordshire Malt, is made, which is esteem'd the best in England. As Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, are taken up in Manu∣factures, and fam'd for Industry, this County has no Manufacture at all; nor are the Poor, except the Husband-men, fam'd for any thing so much as idleness and sloth, to their Scandal be it spoken; what the Reason of it is, I know not.</P>
<P>It is scarce possible to talk of any thing in Cambridgeshire but Cambridgeshire itself; whether it be that the County has so little worth speaking of in it, or that the Town has so much, that I leave to others; however, as I am making Mo∣dern Observations, not writing History, I shall look into the County as well as into the Colleges, for what I have to say.</P>
<P>As I said, I first had a view of Cam∣bridge from Gogmagog Hills; I am to add, that there appears on the Moun∣tain that goes by this Name, an antient Camp, or Fortification, that lies on the Top of the Hill, with a double, or rather treble Rampart and Ditch, which most of our Writers say, was neither Ro∣man nor Saxon, but British: I am to add, that King James II caused a spa∣cious Stable to be built in the Area of this Camp, for his Running Horses, and made old Mr. Frampton, whom I mention'd above, Master or Inspector of them: The Stables remain still there, tho' they are not often made use of. As we descend∣ed Westward, we saw the Fenn Coun∣try on our Right, almost all cover'd with Water like a Sea, the Michaelmas Rains having been very great that Year, they had sent down great Floods of Water from the Upland Countries, and those Fenns being as may be very pro∣perly said, the sink of no less than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>
<PB REF="46"/>
the Water, or most part of the Water of thirteen Counties, falls into them, they are often thus overflow'd. The Rivers which thus empty themselves into these Fenns, and which thus carry off the Water, are the Cam or Grant, the Great Ouse, and Little Ouse, the Nene, the Welland, and the River which runs from Bury to Milden-Hall; the Counties which these Rivers drain, as above, are as follows,</P>
<P>Lincoln, * Cambridge, * Hunting∣don, * Bedford, Buckingham, Warwick, Oxford Leicester, * Northampton, * Rut∣land, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex.</P>
<P>Note, Those Mark'd with (*) empty all their Waters this Way, the rest but in Part.</P>
<P>In a Word, all the Water of the mid∣dle Part of England which does not run into the Thames or the Trent, comes down into these Fenns.</P>
<P>In these Fenns are abundance of those admirable Pieces of Art call'd Duckoys; that is to say, Places so adapted for the harbour and shelter of Wild-Fowl, aud then furnish'd with a Breed of those they call Decoy-Ducks, who are taught to allure and entice their Kind to the Places they belong to, that it is incredi∣ble what Quantities of Wild-fowl of all sorts, Duck, Mallard, Teal, Widgeon, &amp;c. they take in those Duckoys every Week, during the Season; it may in∣deed be guess'd at a little by this, that there is a Duckoy not far from Ely, which pays to the Landlord, Sir Thomas Hare 500 l. a Year Rent, besides the Charge of maintaining a great number of Servants for the Management; and from which Duckoy alone they assured me at St. Ives, (a Town on the Ouse▪ where the Fowl they took was always brought to be sent to London;) that they gene∣rally sent up three thousand Couple a Week.</P>
<P>There are more of these about Peter∣borow who send the Fowl up twice a Week in Waggon Loads at a time, whose Waggons before the late Act of Parlia∣ment to regulate Carries, I have seen drawn by ten, and twelve Horses a piece they were loaden so heavy.</P>
<P>As these Fenns appear cover'd with Water, so I observ'd too, that they gene∣rally at this latter part of the Year appear also cover'd with Foggs, so that when the Downs and higher Grounds of the adjacent Country were gilded with the Beams of the Sun, the Isle of Ely look'd as if wrapp'd up in Blankets, and no∣thing to be seen, but now and then, the Lanthorn or Cupola of Ely Minster.</P>
<P>One could hardly see this from the Hills and not pity the many thousands of Families that were bound to or confin'd in those Foggs, and had no other Breath to draw than what must be mix'd with those Vapours, and that Steam which so universally overspread the Country: But notwithstanding this, the People, es∣pecially those that are used to it, live un∣concern'd and as Healthy as other Folks, except now and then an Ague, which they make light of, and there are great Numbers of very antient People among them.</P>
<P>I now draw near to Cambridge, to which I fansy I look as if I was afraid to come, having made so many Circum∣locutions beforehand; but I must yet make another Digression before I enter the Town; (for in my way, and as I came in from New Market, about the beginning of September;) I cannot omit, that I came necessarily through Sturbridge Fair, which was then in its height.</P>
<P>If it is a Diversion worthy a Book to treat of Trifles, such as the Gayety of Bu∣ry Fair, it cannot be very unpleasant, e∣specially to the Trading part of the World, to say something of this Fair, which is not only the greatest in the whole Nation, but in the World; nor, if I may believe those whg have seen them all, is the Fair at Leipsick in Saxony the Mart at Frank∣fort on the Main, or the Fairs at Neu∣remberg, or Ausburg, any way to com∣pare to this Fair at Sturbridge.</P>
<P>It is kept in a large Corn-field, near Casterton, extending from the Side of the River Cam, towards the Road, for about half a Mile Square.</P>
<P><PB REF="47"/>
If the Husbandmen who rent the Land, do not get their Corn off before a certain Day in August, the Fair-Keepers may trample it under Foot, and spoil it, to build their Booths, or Tents, for all the Fair is kept in Tents, and Booths: On the other Hand, to ballance that Severi∣ty, if the Fair-Keepers have not done their Business of the Fair, and removed and cleared the Field by another certain Day in September, the Plowmen may come in again, with Plow and Cart, and overthrow all, and trample it into the Dirt; and as for the Filth, Dung Straw, &amp;c. necessarily left by the Fair-Keepers, the Quantity of which is very great, it is the Farmers Fees, and makes them full amends for the trampling, riding, and carting upon, and hardening the Ground</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe all the Parts and Circumstances of this Fair exactly; the Shops are placed in Rows like Streets, whereof one is called Cheapside; and here, as in several other Streets, are all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts of Trades, who sell by Retale, and who come principally from London with their Goods; scarce any Trades are omit∣ted, Goldsmiths, Toyshops, Brasiers, Mer∣ters, Drapers, Pewterers, China-Ware∣houses, and, in a Word, all Trades that can be named in London; with Coffee∣houses, Taverns, Brandy-Shops, and Eating-Houses innumerable, and all in Tents, and Booths, as above.</P>
<P>This great Street reaches from the Road, which, as I said, goes from Cam∣bridge to New-Market, turning short out of it to the Right towards the River, and holds, in a Line, near half a Mile, quite down to the River-side. In another Street, parallel with the Road, are like Rows of Booths, but larger, and more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntermingled with Wholesale Dealers, and one Side, passing out of this last Street <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the left Hand, is a formal great Square, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm'd by the largest Booths, built in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Form, and which they call the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uddery; whence the Name is derived, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd what its Signification is, I could ever yet learn, though I made all pos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble search into it. The Area of this Square is about 80 to 100 Yards, where the Dealers have Room, before every Booth, to take down, and open their Packs, and to bring in Waggons to load and unload.</P>
<P>This Place is separated, and peculiar to the Wholesale Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture. Here the Booths, or Tents, are of a vast Extent, have different A∣partments, and the Quantities of Goods they bring are so Great, that the Insides of them look like another Blackwell-Hall, being as vast Ware-Houses piled up with Goods to the Top. In this Drud∣dery, as I have been informed, there have been Sold one Hundred Thousand Pounds worth of Woollen Manufactures in less than a Week's Time; besides the prodigious Trade carry'd on here, by Wholesale-Men, from London, and all Parts of England, who transact their Bu∣siness wholly in their Pocket Books, and meeting their Chapmen from all Parts, make up their Accompts, receive Mo∣ney chiefly in Bills, and take Orders: These, they say, exceed, by far, the Sales of Goods actually brought to the Fair▪ and delivered in kind; it being fre∣quent for the London Wholesale Men to carry back Orders from their Dealers for ten Thousand Pounds worth of Goods a Man, and some much more. This e∣specially, respects those People who deal in heavy Goods, as Wholesale Grocers, Salters, Brasiers, Iron-Merchants▪ Wine-Merchants, and the like; but does not exclude the Dealers in Woollen Manu∣factures, and especially in Mercery Goods of all Sorts▪ the Dealers in which gene∣rally manage their Business in this Man∣ner</P>
<P>Here are Clothiers from Hallifax, Leeds. Wakefield and Huthersfield, in Yorkshire, and from Rochdale, Bury, &amp;c. in Lancashire, with vast Quantities of Yorkshire Cloths, Kerseys, Pennistons, Cottons, &amp;c. with all Sorts of Manche∣ster Ware, Fustians, and Things made of Cotton Wool; of which the Quanti∣ty is so great, that they told me there were near a Thousand Horse-Packs of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>
<PB REF="48"/>
and these took up a side and half of the Duddery at least; also a part of a Street of Booths were taken up with Up∣holsterer's Ware, such as Tickings, Sack∣ings, Kidderminster Stuffs, Blankets, Rugs, Quilts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the Duddery I saw one Ware-house, or Booth, with six Apartments in it, all belonging to a Dealer in Norwich Stuffs only, and who they said had there a∣bove Twenty Thousand Pounds value, in those Goods, and no other.</P>
<P>Western Goods had their Share here also, and several Booths were fill'd as full with Serges, Duroys, Druggets, Shal∣loons, Cantaloons, Devonshire Kersies, &amp;c. from Exeter, Taunton, Bristol, and other Parts West, and some from London also.</P>
<P>But all this is still outdone at least in show, by two Articles, which are the peculiars of this Fair, and do not begin till the other part of the Fair, that is to say for the Wollen Manufacture begins to draw to a Close: These are the Wooll, and the Hops; as for the Hops, there is scarce any Price fix'd for Hops in Eng∣land, till they know how they sell at Sturbridge Fair; the Quantity that ap∣pears in the Fair is indeed prodigious, and they, as it were, possess a large Part of the Field on which the Fair is kept, to themselves; they are brought directly from Chelmsford in Essex, from Canterbury and Maidstone in Kent, and from Farnham in Surrey, besides what are brought from London, the growth of those, and other Places.</P>
<P>Enquiring why this Fair should be thus, of all other Places in England, the Cen∣ter of that Trade; and so great a Quan∣tity of so bulky a Commodity be carried thither so far: I was answered, by one thoroughly acquainted with that Matter, thus: The Hops, said he, for this Part of England, grow principally in the two Counties of Surrey and Kent, with an exception only to the Town of Chelms∣ford in Essex, and there are very few planted any where else.</P>
<P>There are indeed, in the West of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> Wilton, near Salisbury; at Hereford and Broomsgrove, near Wales, and the like but the Quantity is inconsiderable, and the Places remote, so that none of them come to London.</P>
<P>As to the North of England, they for∣merly used but a few Hops there, their Drink being pale smooth Ale, which re∣quir'd no Hops, and consequently they planted no Hops in all that part of Eng¦land, North of Trent; nor did I ever see an Acre of Hop-Ground, planted beyond Trent, in my Observations; but as for some Years past, they not only brew great Quantities of Beer in the North but also use Hops, in the brewing their Ale, much more than they did before so they all come South of Trent to buy their Hops; and here being vast Quan∣tities brought, 'tis great Part of their back Carriage into Yorkshire, and North∣amptonshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire and all those Counties; nay, of late since the Union, even to Scotland itself for I must not omit here also to mention that the River Grant, or Cam, which runs close by the N. W. side of the Fair, in its way from Cambridge to Ely is Navigable, and that by this means all heavy Goods are brought even to the Fair-Field, by Water Carriage from London, and other Parts; first to the Port of Lynn, and then in Barges up the Ouse, from the Ouse into the Cam and so, as I say, to the very Edge of the Fair.</P>
<P>In like manner great Quantities of hea∣vy Goods, and the Hops among the rest are sent from the Fair to Lynn, by Wa∣ter, and shipped there for the Humber to Hull, York, &amp;c. and for New-Castle upon Tyne, and by New-Castle, even to Scotland itself Now as there is still no planting of Hops in the North, though a great Consumption, and the Consump¦tion increasing Daily, this, says my Friend, is one Reason why at Sturbridge Fair there is so great a Demand for the Hops. He added, that besides this there were very few Hops, if any word naming, growing in all the Counties even on this side Trent, which were a
<PB REF="49"/>
above forty Miles from London; those Counties depending on Sturbridge Fair for their supply, so the Counties of Suf∣folk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Northampton, Lincoln, Leicester, Rut∣land, and even to Stafford, Warwick and Worcestershire, bought most if not all their Hops at Sturbridge Fair.</P>
<P>These are the Reasons why so great a Quantity of Hops are seen at this Fair, as that it is incredible, considering too, how remote from this Fair the Growth of them is, as above.</P>
<P>This is likewise a Testimony of the prodigious resort of the Trading People of all Parts of England to this Fair; the Quantity of Hops that have been sold at one of these Fairs is diversly reported, and some affirm it to be so great, that I dare not copy after them; but without doubt it is a surprising Account, especi∣ally in a cheap Year.</P>
<P>The next Article brought hither, is Wooll, and this of several sorts, but prin∣cipally Fleece Wooll out of Lincolnshire, where the longest Staple is found; the Sheep of these Countries being of the largest Breed.</P>
<P>The Buyers of this Wooll, are chiefly indeed the Manufactures of Norfolk and Suffolk, and Essex, and it is a prodigious Quantity they buy.</P>
<P>Here I saw what I have not observ'd in any other Country of England, namely, a Pocket of Wooll. This seems to be first call'd so in Mockery, this Pocket being so big, that it loads a whole Waggon, and reaches beyond the most extream Parts of it hanging over both before, and behind, and these ordinarily weigh a Ton or 25 Hundred weight of Wooll, all in one Bag.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Wooll only, which has been sold at this Place at one Fair, has been said to amounty to fifty or sixty Thousand Pounds in value some say a great deal more.</P>
<P>By these Articles a Stranger may make some guess, at the immense Trade car∣ried on at this Place; what prodigious Quantities of Goods are bought, and sold here, and what a confluence of Peo∣ple are seen here from all Parts of England.</P>
<P>I might go on here to speak of several other sorts of English Manufactures, which are brought hither to be sold; as all sorts of wrought Iron, and Brass Ware from Birmingham; Edg'd Tools, Knives, &amp;c. from Sheffield; Glass Wares, and Stock∣ings, from Nottingham, and Leicester and an infinite Throng of other things of smaller, value, every Morning.</P>
<P>To attend this Fair, and the prodigi∣ous conflux of People, which come to it, there are sometimes no less than fifty Hackney Coaches, which come from London, and ply Night and Morning to carry the People to and from Cam∣bridge; for there the Gross of the Peo∣ple lodge; nay, which is still more strange, there are Wherries brought from London on Waggons to plye upon the little River Cam, and to row People up and down from the Town, and from the Fair as Occasion presents.</P>
<P>It is not be wondered at, if the Town of Cambridge cannot receive, or entertain the Numbers of People that come to this Fair; not Cambridge only, but all the Towns round are full; nay, the very Barns, and Stables are turn'd into Inns, and made as fit as they can to Lodge the meaner sort of People: As for the People in the Fair, they all universally Eat, Drink and Sleep in their Booths, and Tents▪ and the said Booths are so intermingled with Taverns, Coffee-Houses, Drinking-Houses, Eating-Houses, Cooks-Shops, &amp;c. and, all in Tents too, and so many Butch∣ers, and Higlers from all the Neighbour∣ing Counties come into the Fair every Morning with Beef, Mutton, Fowls, Butter, Bread, Cheese, Eggs, and such things; and go with them from Tent to Tent, from Door to Door, that there's no want of any Provisions of any kind, either dress'd, or undress'd.</P>
<P>In a Word, the Fair is like a well for∣tify'd City, and there is the least Disorder and Confusion (I believe) that can be seen any where, with so great a Concourse of People.</P>
<P>Towards the latter End of the Fair, and when the great Hurry of Wholesale
<PB REF="50" MS="y"/>
Business begins to be over, the Gentry come in, from all Parts of the County <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound; and tho' they come for their Diversion; yet ▪tis not a little Money, they lay out, which generally falls to the share of the Retailers, such as Toy∣shops, Goldsmiths, Brasiers, Ironmong∣ers, Turners, Milleners, Mercers, &amp;c. and some loose Corns, they reserve for the Pupput Shows, Drolls, Rope Dan∣cers, and such like; of which there is no want, though not considerable like the rest: The last Day of the Fair is the Horse Fair, where the whole is clos'd with both Horse and Foot Races, to divert the meaner sort of People only, for no∣thing considerable is offer'd of that Kind: Thus Ends the whole Fair, and in less than a Week more, there is scarce any Sign left that there has been such a thing there; except by the Heaps of Dung and Straw, and other Rubbish which is left behind, frod into the Earth, and which is as good as a Summer's fallow for Dunging to the Land; and as I have said above, pays the Husbandman well for the use of it.</P>
<P>I should have mention'd, that here is a Court of Justice always open, and held every Day in a Shed built on pur∣pose in the Fair; this is for keeping the Peace, and deciding Controversies in i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> matters Deriving from the Business of the Fair: Magistrates of the Town of Cambridge are Judges in this Court, as being their Jurisdiction, or they holding it by special Priviledge: Here they deter∣mine Matters in a Summary way, as is practis'd in those we call Pye-Powder Courts in other Places, or as a court of Con∣s ience; and they have a final Authority wi hout Appeal.</P>
<P>I come now to the Town, and Uni∣versity of Cambridge: I say the Town and University, for tho' they are Blend∣ed together in the Situation, and the Colleges, Halls, and Houses for Litera∣ture are promiscuously scatter'd up and down among the other Parts, and some even among the meanest of the other Buildings; as Magdalen College over the Bridge, is in particular; yet they are all Encorporated together, by the Name of the University, and are govern'd apart and distinct from the Town, which they are so intermix'd with.</P>
<P>As their Authority is distinct from the Town, so are their Priviledge,, Customs, and Government; they choose Represen∣tatives, or Members of Parliament for themselves, and the Town does the like for themselves also apart.</P>
<P>The Town is govern'd by a Mayor, and Aldermen. The University by a Chancellor, and Vice-Chancellor, &amp;c. Tho' their Dwellings are mix'd and seem a little confus'd, their Authority is not so; in some Cases the Vice Chancellor may concern himself in the Town, as in searching Houses for the Scholars at im∣proper Hours, removing scandalous Wo∣men, and the like.</P>
<P>But as the Colleges are many, and the Gentlemen entertain'd in them are a very great Number, the Trade of the Town very much depends upon them, and the Tradesmen may justly be said to get their Bread by the Colleges; and this is the surest hold the University may be said to have of the Townsmen, and by which they secure the Depen∣dence of the Town upon them, and con∣sequently their Submission.</P>
<P>I remember some Years ago a Brewer, who being very rich and popular in the Town, and one of their Magistrates, had in several things so much oppos'd the U∣niversity, and insulted their Vice Chan∣cellor, or other Heads of Houses, that in short the University having no other way to exert themselves, and show their Re∣sentment, they made a By-Law or Order among themselves, that for the future they would not Trade with him, and that none of the Colleges, Halls, &amp;c. would take any more Beer of him; and what follow'd▪ The Man indeed brav'd it out a while but when he found he cou'd not obtain a Revocation of the Order, he was fain to leave off his Brewhouse, and if I remem∣ber right, quitted the Town.</P>
<P>Thus I say, Interest gives them Autho∣rity; and there are abundance of Reasons why the Town shou'd not disoblige the University, as there are some also o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="51"/>
the other Hand, why the University should not differ to any Extremity with the Town; nor, such is their Prudence, do they let any Disputes between them run up to any Extremities, if they can avoid it. As for Society; to any Man who is a lover of Learning, or of learn∣ed Men, here is the most agreeable un∣der Heaven; nor is there any want of Mirth and good Company of other Kinds. But 'tis to the Honour of the University to say, that the Governors so well under∣stand their Office, and the Governed their Duty, that here is very little En∣couragement given to those Seminaries of Crime the Assemblies, which are so much boasted of in other Places.</P>
<P>Again, as Dancing, Gaming, Intrieg∣ing, are the three principal Articles which recommend those assemblies, and that generally the Time for carrying on Af∣fairs of this Kind, is the Night, and sometimes all Night; a Time as Unsea∣sonable as Scandalous; add to this, that the Orders of the University admit no such Excesses: I therefore say, as this is the Cafe, 'tis to the Honour of the whole Body of the University, that no Encou∣ragement is given to them here.</P>
<P>As to the Antiquity of the University in this Town, the Originals and Foun∣ders of the several Colleges, their Reve∣nues, Laws, Government and Governors, they are so effectually and so largely treat∣ed of by other Authors, and are so fo∣reign to my Design, that I refer my Rea∣ders to Mr. Camden's Britannia, and the Author of the Antiquities of Cambridge, and other such learned Writers, by whom they may be fully informed.</P>
<P>The present Vice-Chancellor is Dr. Snape, formerly Master of Eaton School near Windsor; and famous for his Dis∣pute with, and evident Advantage over the late Bishop of Bangor, in the time of his Government; the Dispute between the University and the Master of Trinity Colledge has been brought to a Head, so as to employ the Pens of the learned on both sides; but at last prosecuted in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> judicial Way, so as to deprive Dr. Bent∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey of all his Dignities and Offices in the University; but the Doctor flying to the Royal Protection, the University is under a Writ of Mandamus, to shew Cause why they do not restore the Dr. again, to which it seems they demur, and that Demur has not, that we hear, been argued, at least when these Sheets were wrote; what will be the Issue Time must shew.</P>
<P>From Cambrdge the Road lies North West, on the Edge of the Fenns, to Huntingdon, where it joins the great North Road; on this side, 'tis all an agreeable Corn Country, as above; adorn'd with several Seats of Getlemen, but the Chief is the noble House, Seat, or Mansion of Wimple, or Wimple Hall, formerly built at a vast Expence, by the late Earl of Radnor; adorn'd with all the natural Beauties of Situation; and to which was added, all the most exquisite Contrivances which the best Heads could Invent, to make it artificially as well as naturally Pleasant.</P>
<P>However, the Fate of the Radnor Family so directing, it was bought, with the whole Estate about it, by the late Duke of Newcastle; in a Partition of whose immense Estate, it fell to the Right Honourable the Lord Harley, (Son and Heir apparent of the present Earl of Oxford and Mortimer) in Right of the Lady Harriot Cavendish, only Daughter of the said Duke of New∣castle, who is married to his Lordship, and brought him this Estate, and many other, sufficient to demonstrate her the richest Heiress in great Britain.</P>
<P>Here his Lordship resides, and has already so recommended himself to this Country, as to be, by a great Majority chosen Knight of the Shire for the County of Cambridge.</P>
<P>From Cambridge, My Design obliging me, and the direct Road in part coacur∣ing, I came back through the West part of the County of Fssex, and at Saffron Walden I saw the Ruins of the once largest and most magnifinent Pile in all this Part of England, viz. Audley End, built by, and decaying with, the noble Dukes and Earls of Suffolk.</P>
<P><PB REF="52" MS="y"/>
A little North of this Part of the Country rises the River Stour, which, for a Course of fifty Miles or more, parts the two Counties of Suffolk and Es∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x; passing through or near Haveril, Clare, Cavendish, Halsted, Sudbury, Buers, Nayland, Stretford, Dedham, Man∣ningtree, and into the Sea at Harwich; assisting by its Waters to make one of the best Harbours for Shipping that is in Great Britain: I mean Orwell Haven, or Harwich, of which I have spoken largely already.</P>
<P>As we came on this Side we saw, at a Distance, Braintree and Bocking, two Towns, large, rich, and Populous, and made so Originally by the Bay Trade, of which I have spoken at large at Col∣chester, and which flourishes still among them.</P>
<P>The Manor of Braintree I found de∣scended by Purchase, to the Name of Olmeus, the Son of a London Merchant of the same Name; making good what I had observed before, of the great Num∣ber of such who have purchased Estates in this County</P>
<P>Near this Town is Felsted, a small Place, but noted for a Free School, of an ancient Foundation, for many Years under the Mastership of the late Reve∣rend Mr. Lydiat, and brought by him to the Meridian of its Reputation: 'Tis now supplied, and that very worthily, by the Reverend Mr Hutchins.</P>
<P>Near to this is the Priory of Lees, a delicious Seat of the late Duke of Man∣chester, but Sold by the present Duke to the Duchess Dowager of Bucks; his Grace the Duke of Manchester remov∣ing to his yet finer Seat of Kimbol∣ton iu Northamptonshire, the ancient Mansion of the Family. From hence, keeping the London Road, I came to Chelmsford, mentioned before, and In∣gerstone, five Miles West, which I men∣tion again; because, in the Parish Church of this Town, are to be seen the ancient Monuments of the noble Family of Pe∣tre, whose Seat, and a large Estate, lie in the Neigbourhood; and whose whole Family, by a constant Series of Benefi∣cent Actions to the Poor, and Bounty upon all charitable Occasions, have gain∣ed an affectionate Esteem through all that Part of the Country, such as no preju∣dice of Religion could wear out, or per∣haps ever may; and I must co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sels, I think, need not; for good and great Ac∣tions command our respect let the Opi∣nions of the Persons be otherwise what they will.</P>
<P>From hence we cross'd the Country to the great Forest, called Epping <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reaching almost to London, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> try that side of Essex is called the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I suppose, because there are no less than ten Towns almost together, called by the Name of Rooding, and is famous for good Land, good Malt and dirty Roads; the latter indeed, in the Winter, are scarce passable for Horse or Man. In the midst of this we see Chipping On∣ger, Hatfield Broad-Oak, Epping, and many Forest-Towns, fam'd, as I have said, for Husbandy and good Malt; but of no other Note. On the South-side of the County is Waltham-Abby; the Ruins of the Abby remain; and though Anti∣quity is not my proper Business, I could not but observe, that King Harold, slain in the great Battle in Suffex, against William the Conqueror, lies buried here; his Bo∣dy being begg'd by his Mother the Con∣queror allow'd it to be carried hither; but no Monument was as I can find, built for him, only a flat Grave-stone, on which was Engraven, <HI>Harold Infaelix.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I came over the Forest again, that is so say, over the Lower or Western Part of it, where it is spangled with fine Villages, and these Villages fill'd with fine Seats, most of them built by the Citizens of London, as I observed before; but the Lustre of them seems to be entirely swallow'd up in the magni∣ficent Palace of the Lord Castlemain, whose Father, Sir Josiah Child, as it were, prepared it in his Life for the De∣sign of his Son, though altogether un∣foreseen; by adding to the Advantage of its Situation innumerable rows of Trees, planted in rurious Order for Avenues and Visto's, to the House, all leading up to
<PB REF="53"/>
the Place where the old House stood, as to a Center.</P>
<P>In the place adjoining, his Lordship, while he was Sir Richard Child only, and some Years before he began the Founda∣tion of his New House, laid out the most delicious as well as most spacious pieces of Ground for Gardens that is to be seen in all this part of England. The Green-House is an excellent Building fit to en∣tertain a Prince; 'tis furnish'd with Stoves and artificial Places for Heat from an Apartment, in which is a Bagnio, and other Conveniencies, which render it both useful and pleasant; and these Gar∣dens have been the just Admiration of the World, that it has been the general Diversion of the Citizens to go out to see them, till the Crowds grew too great, and his Lordship was oblig'd to restrain his Serva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s from shewing them, ex∣cept on one or two Days in a Week only.</P>
<P>The House is built since these Gar∣dens have been finish'd: The Building is all of Portland Stone, in the Front, which makes it look extremely Glorious and magnificent at a distance; it being the particular property of that Stone, ex∣cept in the Streets of London, where it is tainted and ting'd with the Smoak of the City, to grow Whiter and Whiter the longer it stands in the open Air.</P>
<P>As the Front of the House opens to a long row of Trees, reaching to the great Road at Leighton-Stone; so the Back-Face, or Front, if that be proper, re∣spects the Gardens, and with an easy Descent lands you upon the Terras, from whence is a most beautiful Pro∣spect to the River, which is all form'd into Canals and Openings, to answer the Views from above, and beyond the Ri∣ver, the Walks and Wildernesses go on to such a Distance, and in such a manner up the Hill, as they before went down, that the Sight is lost in the Woods adjoining, and it looks all like one planted Garden as far as the Eye can see.</P>
<P>I shall cover as much as possible the melancholy part of a Story, which touches too sensibly, many, if not most of the great and flourishing Families in England: Pity and matter of Grief it is, to think that Families, by Estate, able to appear in such a glorious Posture as this, should ever be Vulnerable by so mean a Disaster as that of Stock-Jobbing: But the Gene∣ral Infatuation of the Day is a Plea for it; so that Men are not now blamed on that Account: South Sea was a general Posses∣sion; and if my Lord Castlemain was wounded by that Arrow shot in the Dark, 'twas a Misfortune: But 'tis so much a Happiness, that it was not a mortal wound, as it was to some Men, who once seem'd as much out of the reach of it; and that Blow, be it what it will, is not remember'd for joy of the Escape; for we see this noble Family, by Prudence and Management rise out of all that Cloud, if it may be allow d such a Name, and shining in the same full Luster as before.</P>
<P>This cannot be said of some other Fa∣milies in this County, whose fine Parks and new-built Palaces are fallen under Forfeitures and Alienations by the Mis∣fortunes of those Times, and by the Ruin of their Masters Fortunes in that South Sea Deluge.</P>
<P>But I desire to throw a Veil over these Things, as they come in my way; 'tis enough that we write upon them as was written upon King Harold's Tomb at Waltham-Abbey, INFAELIX, and let all the rest sleep among Things that are the fittest to be forgotten.</P>
<P>From my Lord Castlemain's House, and the rest of the fine Dwellings on that Side of the Forest, for there are several very good Houses at Wanstead, only that they seem all swallow'd up in the Luster of his Lordship's Palace; I say, from thence I went South, towards the great Road over that part of the Forest call'd the Flatts, where we see a very beau∣tiful, but retired and rural Seat of Mr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lethulier's, eldest Son of the late Sir John Lethulier, of Lusum in Kent, of whose Family I shall speak when I come on that Side.</P>
<P><PB REF="54" MS="y"/>
By this Turn I came necessarily on to Stratford where I set out: And thus having finished my first Circut, I con∣clude my first Journey.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER travels, as I do, over England, and writes the Account of his Observations, will, as I noted before, always leave something, altering or undertaking, by such a growing, improving Nation as this; or something to discover in a Na∣tion, where so much is hid, sufficient to employ the Pens of those that come after him, or to add, by way of Appendix to what he has already observ'd.</P>
<P>This is my Case, with respect to the Particulars which follow: 1. Since these Sheets were in the Press, a noble Palace of Mr. Walpole's, at present▪ First Com∣missioner of the Treasury, Privy-Coun∣sellor, &amp;c. to King George, is, as it were, risen out of the Ruins of the an∣cient Seat of the Family of Walpole, at Houghton, about 8 Miles distant from Lynn, and on the North Coast of Nor∣folk, near the Sea.</P>
<P>As the House is not yet finished, and when I pass'd by it, was but newly de∣sign'd; it cannot be expected that I should be able to give a particular Description of what it will be: I can do little more than mention, that it appears already to be exceeding magnificent, and suitable to the Genius of the Great Founder.</P>
<P>But a Friend of mine, who lives in that County, has sent me the following Lines, which as he says, are to be plac'd upon the Building; whether on the Frize of the Cornish, or over the Portico, or on what Part of the Build∣ing of that I am not as yet certain: The Inscription is as follows, viz.</P>

<P>A second Thing proper to be added here, by way of Appendix, relates to what I have mention'd of the Port of London, being bounded by the Naze on the Essex Shore, and the North Fore∣land on the Kentish Shore, which some People, guided by the present Usage of the Custom-house, may pretend is not so, to answer such Objectors: The true State of that Cause stands thus.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>“”I. The Clause taken from the Act of Parliament establishing the Extent of the Port of London, and publish'd, in some of the Books of Rates, is this:</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”To prevent all future Differences and Disputes touching the Extent and Limits of the Port of London, the said Port is declared to extend, and be accounted, from the Promentary, or Point, call'd the North Foreland, in the Isle of Thanet, and from thence Northward, in a right Line, to the Point called the Naze, beyond the Gunfleet, upon the Coast of Essex; and so continued Westward through∣out the River Thames, and the seve∣ral Chanels, Streams and Rivers fall∣ing into it, to London Bridge; saving
<PB REF="55" MS="y"/>
the usual and known Rights, Liber∣ties and Priviledges of the Ports of Sandwich, and Ipswich, and either of them, and the known Members there∣of, and of the Customers, Comptro∣lers, Searchers, and their Deputies, of and within the said Ports of Sandwich and Ipswich, and the several Creeks, Harbours and Havens to them, or either of them, respectively belong∣ing▪ within the Counties of Kent and Essex.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Notwithstanding what is above written, the Port of London, as in Use since the said Order, is understood to reach no farther than Gravesend in Kent, and Tilbury Point in Essex▪ and the Ports of Rochester, Milton, and Feversham, belong to the Port of Sandwich.</Q></P>
<Q>“In like Manner the Ports of Har∣wich, Colchester, Wevenhoe, Malden, Leigh, &amp;c. are said to be Members of the Port of Ipswich.”</Q>
<P>This Observation may suffice for what is needful to be said upon the same Sub∣ject, when I moy come to speak of the Port of Sandwich, and its Members, and their Privileges, with respect to Ro∣chester, Milton, Feversham, &amp;c. in my Circuit through the County of Kent.</P>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY II.</HEAD>
<P>AS in my first Journey I went o∣ver the Eastern Counties of Eng∣land, viz. Essex, Suffolk, Nor∣folk, and Cambridge, and took Course on that Side the River Thames, to view the Sea-coasts Harbours, &amp;c. so being now to travel the Southern Counties, I begin the other side of the Thames, and shall surround the Sea∣coast of Kent, as I did that of Norfolk, Suffolk, and perhaps it is as fruitful of Instructing and Diverting Observations as any of the other.</P>
<P>I took Boat at Tower Wharf, sending my Horses round by Land to meet me at Greenwich, that I might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> begin my Journey at the beginning of the County, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd here I had the Advantage of making my first Step into the County of Kent, which is the most delightful Spot of Ground in Great Britain; Pleasant by Si∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uation, those Pleasures encreass'd by Art, and all made compleatly agreeable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the accident of fine Buildings, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontinual passing Fleets of Ships up and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own the most beautiful River in Europe; the best Air, best Prospect, and the best Conversation in England.</P>
<P>The Royal Hospital for Seamen, tho' not yet finished; the Park, the Queen's House, the Observatory on the Hill, com∣monly called Dr. Halley's House, are all things so well known, they need no par∣ticular Description.</P>
<P>The Ground, part of this Hospital now stands upon, and is to stand upon, is the same on which formerly stood the Royal Palace of our Kings. Here Hen∣ry VIII held his Royal Feasts with Jousts and Tournaments; and the Ground which was called toe Tilt-Yard, is the Spot on which the Eastermost Wieg of the Hospital is built; the Park ▪for it was even then a Park also was enlarg'd, wall'd about, and planted with beauti∣ful Rows, or Walks of Trees by King Charles II. soon after the Restoration; and the Design or Plan of a Royal Pa∣lace was then laid out, one Wing of which was finished and covered, in a most magnificent Manner, and makes now the first Wing of the Hospital as
<PB REF="56" MS="y"/>
you come to it from London: The Build∣ing is regular, the lower Part a strong Dorick, the middle Part a most beautiful Corinthian, with an Attick above all, to compleat the Height; the Front to the Water-side is exteramly Magnificent and Graceful; embellished with rich carved Work and fine Devices, such as will hardly be outdone in this, or any Age, for Beauty or Art.</P>
<P>They must be very ignorant of our English Affairs, who have publish'd very lately that Queen Elizabeth built the Royal Palace of Greenwich; whereas it is evident, that it was the Palace of K. Henry VIII. her Father, before she was Born; and this is prov'd beyond Con∣tradiction by this particular Circum∣stance, that her Majesty was Born in this very Palace which she is there said to have built.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of Greenwich is owing to the Luster of its Inhabitants, where there is a kind of Collection of Gentle∣men, rather than Citizens, and of Persons of Quality and Fashion, different from most, if not all, the Villages in this Part of England.</P>
<P>Here several of the most active and useful Gentlemen of the late Armies, after having grown Old in the Service of their Country, and covered with the Honours of the Field, are retired to en∣joy the remainder of their Time, and reflect with Pleasure upon the Dangers t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey have gone through, and the faithful Services they have performed both A∣broad and at Home.</P>
<P>Several Generals, and several of the inferior Officers, I say, having thus cho∣sen this calm Retreat, live here in as much Honour and Delight as this World can give.</P>
<P>Other Gentlemen still in Service, as in the Navy, Ordnance, Docks, Yards, &amp;c. as well while in Business, as after laying down their Employments, have here planted themselves, insomuch, that the Town of Greenwich begins to out-swell its Bounds, and extends itself not only on this side the Park to the Top of the Heath, by the way call'd Crump-Hill, but now stretches out on the East-side, where Sir John Vanbrug has built a House Ca∣stle-wise, and where in a little time 'tis probable, several Streets of like Buildings will be erected, to the enlarging and beautifying the Town, and encreasing the Inhabitants; who, as I have said, are already the chief Beauty and Ornament of the Place: We are told also, that Leave will be obtained to build a new Church on that side; the Partish-Church, though new rebuilt▪ and very large and beautiful, not being sufficient to receive the Inhabitants, much less will it be so, if the Buildings go on to encrease; as they have done, and as they now seem to do.</P>
<P>The River of Thames is here very broad, and the Chanel deep, and the Water, at some very high Spring Tides is Salt; but in Ordinary Tides, is very sweet and fresh, especially at the Tide of Ebb.</P>
<P>The Country behind Greenwich adds to the Pleasure of the Place: Black-Heath both for Beauty of Situation, and an ex∣cellent Air, is not out-done by any spot of Ground so near the River and so near Land in England</P>
<P>On the East-side stands an Hospital ve∣ry particular for its Foundation or De∣sign, though through the Misfortunes o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Times, the Generous Design of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Founder has been much straiten'd, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in great part defeated.</P>
<P>It was built by Sir John Morden, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Turkey Merchant of London, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lived in a great House at the going o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Heath, a litle South of th Hospital on the Road to Eltham; hi first Design, as I had it from his ow Mouth the Year before he began <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> build, was to make Apartments for fort decay'd Merchants, to whom he resol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed to allow 40 l. per Annum each; wit Coals, a Gown (and Servants to loo after their Apartments) and many oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conveniencies, so as to make their Liv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as comfortable as possible, and that, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had liv'd like Gentlemen, they mig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dye so.</P>
<P><PB REF="57"/>
Sir John Morden and his Lady lie bu∣ried in a Vault in the Chancel of the Chapel of this Hospital: The Chapel is a very great Building facing the Entrance into the Courrt: The Lodgings for the Merchants, are on either side; two A∣partments in each Stai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Case, with Cel∣lars for their Conveni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncies, Coals, Beer, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and each Apartment consists of a Bed-Chamber and a Study, or large <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for their Retreat, and to divert <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in with Books, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have a Publ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck Kitchen, a Hall to Dine in, and over the Hall is a large Room for the Trustees (who manage the whole) to meet in; there is also a very good Apartment for the Chaplain, whose Salary is 50l. a Year; there are also Dwellings for the Cooks, Butlers, Por∣ter, the Women and other Servants, and reasonable Salaries allow'd them: And behind the Chapel is a handsome Burying-Ground wall'd in; there are also very good Gardens; in a Word, it is the no∣blest Foundation, and most considerable single Piece of Charity that has been erected in England since Sutton's Hospital in London: I call it single, because it has been built and endow'd by one single Hand; the Situation is very pleasant, and the Air very Healthy and Good.</P>
<P>There is erected over the Gate, since Sir John's Death, his Statue in Stone, set up by his Lady, and since her Death, her own is set up near it, by the Trustees; she having been a Benefactress to the Foundation many Ways since his Decease</P>
<P>There is a Velvet Pall given, by her Ladyship in particular, to be laid up in the Chapel for the Use of the Gentlemen; as also a large Quantity of Communion-Plate, and the Chaplain is oblig'd to read Prayers twice every Day, viz. At Eleven a Clock, and at Three; at which all the Pensioners are oblig'd to attend.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Heath, North# is Charleton, a Village famous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r rather infamous, for that yearly col∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected Rabble of Mad-People, at Horn-Fair; the Rudeness of which I cannot but think, is such as ought to be sup∣press'd, and indeed in a civiliz'd well govern'd Nation, it may well be said to be unsufferable. The Mob indeed at that Time take all kinds of Liberties, and the Women are especially Impuden<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that Day; as if it was a Day that justi∣fy'd the giving themselves a Loose to all manner of Indecency and Immodesty, without any Reproach, or without suf∣fering the Censure which su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Behaviour would deserve, at another Time.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Introduction of this rude Assembly or the Occasion of it, I can meet with very little A count of, in Antiquity; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> recommend i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the pvblick Jus∣ti e to be suppress'd, as a Nusance and Offence to all sober People▪ than to spend any Time to enquire into its Original.</P>
<P>There are some very good Houses late¦ly built in this Town, and abating the Rabble and Hurry of the 19th of Octo∣ber as above, 'tis indeed a very pleasant Village, standing on the Top of a nigh Hill, yet shelter'd on one Side by Shoot∣er's-Hill, which is much higher, and on the other Side, over-looking the Marshes and the River Thames, on which it has a very agreeable Prospect from London almost to Gravesend.</P>
<P>Thro' this Town lies the Road of Woolwich, a Town on the Bank to the same River, wholly taken up by, and in a manner raised from, the Ya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds and publick Works, erected there for the publick Service. Here, when the Business of the Royal Navy en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reased, and Queen Elizabeth built larger and greater Ships of War than were usually employ'd before, new Docks and Launches were erected, and Places prepared, for the building and repair∣ing Ships of the largest Size; because, as here was a greater Depth of Water and a freer Channel than at Deptford,; (where the chief Yard in the River of Thames was before) so there was less Ha∣zard in the great Ships going up and
<PB REF="58" MS="y"/>
down; the Crowd of Merchant-Ships at Deptford, being always such, as that it could not be so safe to come up thither, as to put in at Woolwich.</P>
<P>At this Dock the Royal Sovereign was built, once the largest Ship in the whole Royal Navy, and in particular esteem'd, for so large a Ship, the best Sailor in the World. Here also was rebuilt the Royal Prince, now call'd the Queen, a First Rate, carrying a hundred Guns, and several others: Close under the South Shore from the West End of Woolwich, the Thames is very deep, and the Men of War lie there moor'd, and as we call it, laid up; their Top-masts and all their small Rigging taken down and laid in Warehouses; this reaches as high as the Point over-against Bow River, and is call'd Bugby's Hole.</P>
<P>The Docks, Yards, and all the Build∣ings belonging to it, are encompassed with a high Wall, and are exceeding spacious and convenient; and are also prodigious full of all manner of Stores of Timber, Plank, Masts, Pitch, Tar, and all manner of Naval Provisions to such a Degree, as is scarce to be calcu∣lated.</P>
<P>Besides the Building-Yards, here is a large Rope-Walk, where the biggest Ca∣bles are made for the Men of War; and on the East or lower Part of the Town is the Gun-yard or Place set apart for the great Guns belonging to the Ships, com∣monly call'd the Park, or the Gun-Park; where is a prodigious Quantity of all manner of Ordnance-Stores, such as are fit for Sea-Service, that is to say, Cannon of all sorts for the Ships of War, every Ship's Guns by themselves; heavy Can∣non for Batteries, and Mortars of all Sorts and Sizes; insomuch that, as I was inform'd, here has been sometimes laid up at one time between seven and eight Thousand Pieces of Ordnance, besides Mortars and Shells without Number.</P>
<P>Here also is the House where the Firemen and Engineers prepare their Fireworks, charge Bombs, Carcasses, and Grenades for the publick Service, in time of War; and here, (if I remem∣ber right, it was, in the time of a Dutch War) by Mischance, the Fire in their Lab'ratory took hold of some Combu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i∣bles, which spreading, fir'd first a Bomb or Shell, and the bursting of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blew up all the Works with such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Blast and Noise, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shatter'd the Town of Woolwich <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in pieces, and terrify'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> last degree, but kill'd no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> heard of, except about Eleven <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were in or near the Fireworking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> where it first took hold.</P>
<P>In this Park, close on the South <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the River, a large Battery of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Pieces of heavy Cannon was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have saluted the Dutch, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thought fit to have ventur'd up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in 1667. as was given out they would when they burnt our Ships at Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham; and large Furnaces and Forges were ere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ted to have furnish'd the Gunners with red hot Bullets for that Service; but the Dutch had no Design that way, and did their Business with far less Hazard, and as much to our Disgrace in another Place.</P>
<P>Here is usually a Guardship Riding, especially in time of Service; also here is a large Hulk made of the Carcass of an old Man of War, sufficiently large for setting the Masts of the biggest Ships in the Navy. The Thames is here at high Water near a Mile over, and the Water Salt upon the Flood; and as the Channel l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es strait East and West for a∣bout Three Miles, the Tide runs very strong; 'tis entirely free from Shoals and Sands, and has seven or eight Fathom Water▪ so that the biggest Ships, and a great many of them, might ride here with safety even at low Water.</P>
<P>From this Town there is little remark∣able upon the River, till we come to Gravesend▪ the whole Shore being low, and spread with Marshes and unhealthy Grounds, except with small intervals, where the land bends inward as at Erith, Greenhith, North Fleet, &amp;c. in which pla∣ces the Chalk Hills come close to the River
<PB REF="59"/>
and from thence the City of London, the adjacent Counties, and, even Hol∣land and Flanders, are supply'd with Lime for their Building, or Chalk to make Lime, and for other Uses.</P>
<P>From these Chalky Cliff▪ on the River side, the Rubbish of the Chalk, which crumbles away when they dig the larger Chalk for Lime or, (as we might call it) the Chips of the Chalk, and which they must be at the Charge of removing to be out of their way is bought and fetch d away by Lighters and Hoys, and carry'd to all the Ports and Creeks in the opposite County of Essex▪ and even to Suffolk and Norfolk, and sold there o the Country Farmers to lay up∣on their Land, and that in prodigious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and so it is valued by the farmers of those Counties, that they not only give from two Shillings and six Pence, to four Shillings a Load for it, according to the Distance the Place is from the said Chalk Cliffs; but they fetch it by Land Carriage Ten Miles, nay Fifteen Miles up into the Country.</P>
<P>This is the Practice in all-the Creeks and Rivers in Essex, even to Malden, Colchester, the Nase, and into Har∣wich Harbour up to Maningtree, and to Ipswich; as also in Suffolk, to Albro', Orford, Dunwich, Swold, and as high as Yarmouth in Norfolk.</P>
<P>Thus the barren Soil of Kent, for such the Chalky Grounds are esteemed, make the Essex Lands Rich and Fruitful, and the mixture of Earth fooms a Composi∣tion, which, out of two barren Ex∣treams, makes one prolifick Medium; the strong Clay of Essex and Suffolk is made Fruitful by the soft meliorating melting Chalk of Kent, which fattens and enriches it.</P>
<P>On the back-side of these Marshy-Grounds in Kent, at a small Distance, lies the Road from London to Dover, and on that Highway, or near it, seve∣ral good Towns; for Example, Eltham, formerly a Royal Palace, when the Court was kept at Greenwich; and Queen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who (as before) was Born at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was often carry'd, as they say, to Eltham by her Nurses, to suck in the wholesome Air of that agreeable Place; but at present there are few or no Signs of the old Palace to be seen.</P>
<P>It is now a pleasant Town, very hand∣somely built, full of good Houses; and many Families of rich Citizens inhabit here: (As I observ'd of the Villages ad∣jacent to London in other Counties) So it is here, they bring a gre t deal of good Company with them: Also, abun∣dance of Ladies of very good Fortunes dwell here, and one sees at the Church such an Appearance of the Sex, as is surprizing; but 'tis complain'd of, that the Youths of these Families where those Beauties grow, are so generally o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> almost universally bred Abroad, either in Tur∣key, Italy, or Spain, as Merchants, or in the Army or Court as Gentlemen; that for the Ladies to live at Eltham, is, as it were, to live Recluse, and out of Sight; since to be kept where the Gentlemen do not come, is all one as to be kept where they cannot come. This they say threatens Eltham with a fatal Turn, un∣less the Scene alters in a few Years, and they tell us, that all the Ladies will aban∣don the Place.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of this Place at Lusum, Sir John Lethulier, a Turkey Merchant, liv'd for many Years, and to a great Age, and has establish'd his Fa∣mily in the separate Houses of three or four several Sons, to all which he has left plentiful Estates in this Country, but especially in Essex, where his eldest Son has a very noble Seat, and Estate near Barking.</P>
<P>From this Side of the Country, all pleasant and gay, we go over Shooter's-Hill where the Face of the World seems quite alter'd; for here we have but a Chalky Soil and indifferently Fruitful, far from Rich; much overgrown with Wood, especially Coppice-Wood, which is cut for Faggots and Bavins, and sent up by Water to London. Here they make those Faggots which the Wood-mongers call Ostrey-Wood, and here in particular those small light Bavins which are used in Taverns in London to light
<PB REF="60" MS="y"/>
their Faggots, and are call'd in the Ta∣verns a Brush, the Wood-men call them Pimps; 'tis incredible what vast Quanti∣ties of these are lay'd up at Woolwich, Erith, and Dartford; but since the Ta∣verns in London are come to make Coal-Fires in their Upper Rooms, that Cheat of a Trade declines; and tho' that Ar∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le would seem to be trifling in itself, 'tis not trifling to observe what an Altera∣tion it makes in the Value of those We <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, and how many more of them than usual are yearly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iubb'd up, and the Land made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the Plow.</P>
<P>As I passed, I saw Gravesend from the Hills, but having been often in the Town, I know enough to be able to say, that there is nothing considerable in it; except first that it is the Town where the great Ferry (as they call it) is kept up between London and East Kent: It is hardly credible what Numbers of People pass here every Tide, as well by Night as by Day, between this Town and Lon∣don: Almost all the People of East Kent, when they go for London, go no farther by Land than this Town, and then for Six-pence in the Tilt-Boat, or One Shilling in a small Boat or Wherry, are carried to London by Water.</P>
<P>About 25 Years ago one of these Tilt-Boats was cast away, occasion'd by the desperate Obstinaey and Rudeness of the Steersman, or Master, as they call him, who would tack again, and stand over upon a Wind, in the Reach call'd Long-Reach, contrary to the Advice and In∣treaties, not of the Passengers only, but of his own Rowers, who told him it blew a Storm, and she would founder; but he call'd them Fools, bid the Wind Blow Devil, (a rude Sailor's Proverb) the more Wind the better Boat, till com∣ing into the Channel where the Sea ran very high, he took in a Wave, or a Sea, as they call it, which run her down, and founder'd her, as was foretold; and him∣self and three and fifty Passengers were all drown'd, only about five escaping by Swimming.</P>
<P>The other Thing for which this Town is worth Notice, is, that all the Ships which go to Sea from London, take, as we say, their Departure from hence; for here all Outward-bound Ships must stop, come to an Anchor, and suffer what they call a second Clearing, (viz.) Here a Searcher of the Customs comes on board, looks over all the Coquets or Entries of the Cargo, and may, if he pleases, rum∣mage the whole Loading, to see if there are no more Goods than are enter'd which however they seldom do, tho' they forget not to take a Compliment for their Civility, and, besides being well treated on Board, have generally three or five Guns fir'd in Honour to them when they go off.</P>
<P>The Method of causing all Ships to stop here before they go, is worth ob∣serving, and is as follows:</P>
<P>When a Merchant-Ship comes down from London, (if they have the Tide of Ebb under Foot, or a fresh Gale of Wind from the West, so that they have, what they call Fresh-Way, and the Ships come down apace,) they generally hand some of their Sails, haul up a Fore-Sail or Main Sail, or lower the Fore-Top-Sail, so to slacken her Way, as soon as they come to the Old Man's Head; when they open the Reach, which they call Gravesend Reach which begins about a Mile and Half above the Town, they do the like, to signify that they intend to bring too, as the Sailors call it, and come to an Anchor.</P>
<P>As soon as they come among the Ships that are riding in the Road, (as there are always a great many) the Centinel at the Block-House, as they call it, on Graves∣end Side, fires his Musket, which is to tell the Pilot he must bring too; if he comes on, as soon as the Ship passes B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad-side with the Block-House, the Centinel fires again, which is as much as to say, why don't you bring too? If he drives a little farther, he fires a third Time, and the Language of that is, Bring too immediately, and let go your Anchor, or We will make you.</P>
<P>If the Ship continues to drive down, and does not let go her Anchor, the Gunner of the Fort is fetch'd, and he
<PB REF="61" MS="y"/>
fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s a Piece of Cannon tho' without Ball; and that is still a Threat, tho' with some Patience, and is to say, Will you come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o an Anchor or won't you? If he still ventures to go on, by which he gives them to understand he intends to run for it; then the Gunner fires again, and with a Shot, and that Shot is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignal to the Fortress over the River, viz. Tilbury Fort, which I described in my Account of Essex) and they immediately let fly at the Ship from the Guns on the East Ba∣stion; and after from all the Guns they can being to bear upon her; it is very seldom that a Ship will venture their Shot because they can reach her all the way unto the Hope▪ and round to Hope-Point almost to Hole-Haven.</P>
<P>Yet I happen'd once to be upon the Shore just by Tilbury Fort, when a Ship ventu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to run off in spite of all those Fireings; and it being just at the first Shoot of the Ebb, and when a great Fleet of light Colliers and other Ships were under Sail too; by that time, the Ship escaping came round the Hope-Point, she was so hid among the other Ships, that the Gunners on the Bastion hardly knew who to shoot at; upon which they Mann'd out several Boats with Soldiers, in hopes to overtake her, or to make Signals to some Men of War at the Nore, to Man out their Boats, and stop her, but she laugh'd at them all; for as it blew a fresh Gale of Wind at South West, and a Tide of Ebb strong under her Foot, she went three Foot for their one, and by that time the Boats got down to Hole-Haven, the Ship was beyond the Nore, and as it grew Dar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they soon lost Sight of her, nor could they ever hear to this Day what ship it was, or on what Account she ventur'd to run such a Risque.</P>
<P>Another time I was with some Mer∣chants in a large Yacht, bound to France; they had a great Quantity of Block Tin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> other Goods, which had not been enter'd at the Custom-house; and the Master or Captain told us, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but he would pass by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> coming to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> he lay, when this Thought came into his Head, at an Anchor in Gray▪s Reach, just above the Old Man's Head, men∣tion'd above, which is a Point or Head of Land on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssex Shore, which makes the bottom of Gray's Reach, and the up∣per End of Gravesend Reach: He ob∣serv'd that the Mornings were likely to be exceeding Foggy; particularly on the Morning next after his Resolution of trying there was so thick a Fog, that it was scarce possible to see from the Main-Mast to the Bowsprit, even of a Hoy; is being High-water, he resolv'd to weigh a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive, as he call'd it, and so he did: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he came among the other Ships a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d over against the Town, his greatest Danger was running foul of them, to prevent which he kept a Man lying on his Belly at the Bowsprit End, to look out, and so tho' not without some Danger too, he went clear: As for Gravesend or Tilbury Fort, they could see no more of us than they could of London-Bridge; and we drove in this Fog undiscern'd by the Forts or Custom-house Men, as low as Hole-Haven, and went afterwards clear away for Caen in Normandy without being visited.</P>
<P>But such attempts as these, are what would very hardly be brought to pass again now, nor is the Risque worth any body's running if the value be conside∣rable that may be lost; and therefore one may venture to say, that all the Ships which go out of the River from London, are first cleared here, even the empty Col∣liers and Coasters go on shore, and give an Account who they are, and take a Signal from the Custom house Office and pay Sixpence, and then pass on: As for Ships coming in, they all go by here without any notice taken of them, unless it be to put Waiters on board them, if they are not supply'd before.</P>
<P>From Gravesend we see nothing re∣markable on the Road but Gad's Hill, a noted Place for robbing of Seamen after they have receiv'd their pay <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Chatham. Here it was that Famous Robbery

was committed in the Year 1676, or thereabouts; it was about Four a Clock in the Morning when a Gentleman was robb'd by one Nicks on a Bay Mare, just on the declining part of the Hill, on the West side, for he swore to the Spot and to the Man; Mr. Nicks, who rob∣bed him, came away to Gravesend, im∣mediately ferry'd over, and, as he said, was stop'd by the difficulty of the Boat, and of the Passage, near an Hour; which was a great discouragement to him, but was a kind of Bait to his Horse: From thence he rode cross the County of Essex, thro' Tilbury, Hornden, and Bilerecay to Chelmsford: Here he stopp'd about half an Hour to refresh his Horse, and gave him some Balls; from thence to Braintre, Bocking, Wethersfield; then over the Downs to Cambridge, and from thence keeping still the cross Roads, he went by Fenny Stanton to Godmanchester and Huntington, where he baited himself and his Mare about an Hour; and, as he said himself, slept about half an Hour, then holding on the North Road, and keeping a full large Gallop most of that way, he came to York the same After∣noon; put off his Boots and riding Cloths, and went dress'd as if he had been an Inhabitant of the Place, not a Traveller, to the Bowling Green, where among other Gentlemen was the Lord Mayor of the City; he singling out his Lordship, studied to do something particular that the Mayor might remember him by, and accordingly lays some odd Bett with him concerning the Bowls then running, which should cause the Mayor to remember it the more particularly; and then takes Occasion to ask his Lordship what a Clock it was▪ who pulling out his Watch, told him the Hour, which was a quarter be∣fore, or a quarter after Eight at Night.</P>
<P>Some other Circumstances it seems he carefully brought into their Discourse, which should make the Lord Mayor re∣member the Day of the Month exactly, as well as the Hour of the Day.</P>
<P>Upon a Prosecution which happen'd afterwards for this Robbery, the whole Merit of the Case turn'd upon this single Point: The Person robb'd swore as above to the Man, to the Place, and to the Time, in which the Fact <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> committed: Namely, That he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on Gad's Hill in Kent, on such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and at such a Time of the Day, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a Part of the Hill, and that the Prison∣er at the Bar was the Man that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> him: Nicks, the Prisoner de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Fact, call'd several Persons to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reputation, alledg'd that he was as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off as Yorkshire at that Time, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particularly the Day whereon the Pro∣secutor swore he was robb'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was at Bowls on the publick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the City of York; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this, he produced the Lord Mayor York to testify that he was so, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he the Mayor acted so and so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there as above.</P>
<P>This was so positive, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tested, that the Jury acquitted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a bare Supposition, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Man could be at two Places so remote on one and the same day. There are more Particulars related of this Story, such as I do not take upon me to af∣firm; namely, That King Charles II. pre∣vailed on him on Assurance of Pardon, and that he should not be brought into any farther Trouble about it, to confess the Truth to him privately, and that he own'd to his Majesty that he com∣mitted the Robbery, and how he rode the Journey after it, and that upon this the King gave him the Name or Title of Swift Nicks, instead of Nicks; but these Things, I say, I do not relate as certain: I return to the Business in Hand.</P>
<P>From Gad's Hill we come to Roche∣ster Bridge the largest, the highest, and the strongest built of all the Bridges in England, except London Bridge; some in∣deed say, the Bridge of Newcastle upon Tyne, exceeds all the Bridges in England for strength; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and it is indeed very firm and wide, and has a Street of Hou∣ses upon it like London-Bridge, and a Gate in the middle as large as a little Castle, of which in its Place; but then it is neither so high nor so long as this Bridge at Rochester.</P>
<P><PB REF="65" MS="y"/>
Rochester, Stroud, and Chatham, are three distinct Places, but Contiguous, except the Interval of the River be∣tween the two first, and a very small Marsh of Vacancy between Rochester and Chatham.</P>
<P>There is little remarkable in Roche∣ster, except the Ruins of a very old Castle, and an ancient, but not extra∣ordinary Cathedral; but the River, and its Appendices, are the most considera∣ble of the kind in the World. This be∣ing the chief Arsenal of the Royal Na∣vy of Great Britain. The Buildings here are indeed like the Ships them∣selves, surprisingly large, and in their several kinds Beautiful: The Ware-Hou∣ses, or rather Streets of Ware-Houses, and Store Houses for laying up the Na∣val Treasures, are the largest in Dimen∣sion, and the most in Number that are any where to be seen in the World: The Rope-Walks for making Cables, and the Forges for Anchors, and other Iron Work, bear a Proportion to the rest; as also the Wet-Dock for keeping Masts and Yards of the greatest Size, where they lie sunk in the Water to pre∣serve them; the Boat-Yard, the Anchor-Yard; all like the whole monstrously great and extensive, and are not easily described.</P>
<P>We come next to the Stores them∣selves, for which all this Provision is made; and first, To begin with the Ships that are laid up there: The Sails, the Rigging, the Ammunition, Guns, great and small Shot, small Arms, Swords, Cutlasses, Half-Pikes, with all the other Furniture belonging to the Ships that Ride at their Moorings in the River Medway: These take up one Part of the Place, having separate Buildings, and Store-Houses appropriated to them, where the Furniture of every Ship lies in particular Ware-Houses by themselves, and may be taken out on the most hasty Occasion without Confusion, Fire ex∣cepted</P>
<P>N. B. The Powder is generally car∣ry'd away to particular Magazins, to a∣void Disaster.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are Store-Houses for laying up the Furniture, and Stores for Ships; but which are not appropri∣ated, or do not belong (as it is expres∣sed by the Officers) to any particular Ship, but lie ready to be delivered out for the Furnishing other Ships to be Built, or for Repairing and Supplying the Ships already there, as Occasion may require.</P>
<P>For this Purpose there are separate and respective Magazines of Pitch, Tarr, Hemp, Flax, Tow, Rosin, Oyl, Tallow; also of Sail Cloth, Canvas, Anchors, Cables, Standing and Running Rigging, ready fitted, and Cordage not fitted; with all kinds of Ship Chandlery Ne∣cessaries, such as Blocks, Tackles, Run∣ners, &amp;c. with the Cooks, Boatswains, and Gunners Stores, and also Anchors of all sizes, Grapnells, Chains, Bolts, and Spikes, Wrought and Unwrought Iron, Cast Iron Work, such as Potts, Caldrons, Furnaces, &amp;c. also Boats, Spare Masts and Yards; with a great Quan ity of Lead, and Nails, and other Necessaries, (too many to be enumerated) whose Store looks as if it were inexhaustble.</P>
<P>To observe these Things deliberately, one would almost wonder what Ships they were, and where they should be found, which could either for Building, or Repairing, Fitting, or Refitting, call for such a Quantity of all those Things; but when, on the other hand, one fees the Ships, and considers their Dimensi∣on and consequently the Dimension of all Things which belong to them; how Large, how Strong every Thing must be; how much of the Material, must go to the making every Thing propor∣tionable to the Occasion, the Wonder would change its Prospect, and one would be as much amaz'd to think how, and where, they should be supply'd.</P>
<P>The particular Government of these Yards, as they are called, is very Re∣markable, the Commissioners, Clerks, Accomptants, &amp;c. Within Doors, the Store-Keepers, Yard-Keepers, Dock-Keepers, Watchmen, and all other Of∣ficers without Doors, with the Subordi∣nation
<PB REF="66" MS="y"/>
of all Officers one to another re∣spectively, as their Degrees and Offices require, is Admirable. The Watchmen are set duly every Night at stared and certain Places, within the several Yards, with every one a Bell over his Head, which they Ring, or Toll, every Hour, giving so many Strokes as the Hour reckons, and then one taking it from a∣nother through every Part of the Yard, and of all the Yards, makes the Watch∣ing Part be performed in a very exact and regular Manner. In the River there is a Guard Boat, which, as the Main-Guard in a Garrison, goes the Grand Rounds at certain Times, to see that e∣very Centinel does his Duty on Board the Ships; these go by every Ship in the River, and see that the People on board are at their Post: If the Ship does not Challenge, that is to say, if the Man placed to look out does not call, Who comes there? the Guard-Boat boards them immediately, to examin who is deficient in their Duty.</P>
<P>They told us an odd Story of a Guard-Boat, which having not been challenged by the Person who ought to have been walking on the Forecastle of the Ship, boarded them on the Bow, and as the Boat's Crew was entering the Ship by the Fore-Chains, they found a Man fal∣len over-board, but the Lap of his Coat catching in a Block, was drawn so hard in by the running of the Rope in the Block, that it held the Man fast, but he was fallen so low, that his Head and Arms hung in the Water, and he was almost drowned: However, it seems he was not quite Dead; so that catching hold of him, and pulling him out of the Water, they saved his Life: But they added, as the main part of the Story, that the Man could never give any Ac∣count of his Disaster, or how he came to fall over-board▪ only said, That it must be the Devil that threw him over∣board, for nothing else could do it. How true this Passage may be, I do not un∣dertake to enter upon the Debate of.</P>
<P>The Expedition that has been some∣times used here in fitting out Men of War, is very great, and as the Workmen relate it, 'tis indeed incredible; particu∣larly, they told us, That the Royal So∣vereign, a First Rate of 106 Guns, was riding at her Moorings, entirely unrig∣ged, and nothing but her three Masts standing, as is usual when a Ship is lay'd up and that she was compleatly rigg'd, all her Masts up, her Yards put too, her Sails bent, Anchors and Cables on Board, and the Ship failed down to Black Stakes in three Days, Sir Cloudesly Shovell being then her Captain.</P>
<P>I do not vouch the Thing, but when I consider, first, that every thing lay ready in her Store-Houses, and wanted nothing but to be fetch'd out and car∣ry'd on Board, a Thousand or fifteen Hundred Men to be employ'd in it, and more if they were wanted; and every Man knowing his Business perfectly well, Boats, Carriages, Pullies, Tackles, Cranes, and Hulk all ready, I do not know, but it might be done in one Day, if it was try'd; certain it is, the Dexte∣rity of the English Sailors in those things, is not to be match'd by the World.</P>
<P>The Building Yards, Docks, Timber Yard, Deal Yard, Mast Yard, Gun Yard, Rope Walks; and all the o her Yards and Places, set apart for the Works belonging to the Navy, are like a well ordered City; and though you see the whole Place, as it were, in the utmost Hurry, yet you see no Confusion, every Man knows his own Business▪ the ma∣ster Builders appoint the Working or Converting, as they call it, of every Piece of Timber, and give to the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er Head Workmen, or Foreman, their Moulds for the Squaring and Cutting out of every Piece, and placing it in its proper Birth (so they call it) in the Ship that is in Building, and every Hand is busy in pursuing those Directions, and so in all the other Works.</P>
<P>It is about Sixteen or Eighteen Miles from Rochester Bridge to Sheerness <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Water, on the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this it is about Fourteen Miles <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Stakes; the Chanel is so deep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Way, the Banks so soft, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="67"/>
of the River so short, that in a Word, 'tis the safest and best Harbour in the World; and we saw two Ships of Eighty Guns, each riding a float at low Water, within Musquet-shot of Rochester Bridge. The Ships riding as in a Mill-Pond, or a wet Dock, except that being moor'd at the Chains, they swing up and down with the Tide; but as there is room enough, so they are moor'd in such manner, that they cannot swing soul of one another; 'tis as safe (I say) as in a wet Dock, nor did I ever hear of any Accident that befel any of the King's Ships here, I mean by Storms, and 'tis hoped the like may never be known again.</P>
<P>There are two Castles on the Shore of this River, the one at Upmo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where there is a good Platform of Guns, and which guards two Reaches of the Ri∣ver, and is supposed to defend all the Ships which ride above, between that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Bridge; also on the other Shore is Gillingham Castle, form'd for the same Purpose, and well furnish'd with Guns which command the River, besides which there is a Fort or Platform of Guns at a Place call'd the Swamp, and another at Cockham Wood. But all these are added, or at least Additions made to them, since the time that the Dutch made that memorable Attempt upon the Royal Navy this Year (viz.) on the 22d of June, in the Year 1667; for at that time all was left unregarded, and, as it were, secure; there were but four Guns Guns that could be used at Upnor, and scarce so many at Gillingham, the Car∣riages being rotten and broke; and in a Word, every thing concurring to invite the enemy. There were about Twelve Guns at the Isle of Shepey, where since, Sheerness Fort is built, but the Dutch soon beat them from those Guns, and made the Place top hot for them dis∣mounting also most of the Guns, after which they went boldly up to Black-Stakes with their whose Squadron; and after that Seven of their biggest Men of War went up as high as Upnor, where they did what Mischief they could, and went away again, carried off the Royal Charles, a First Rate Ship of 100 Guns, and burning the London, and several others, besides the damaging most of the Ships which were within their reach; and all things consider'd, it was a Victory, that they went away without ruining all the rest of the Navy that was in that River.</P>
<P>But as this is a dull Story in itself, so it is none of my present Business, farther than to introduce what follows; namely, That this Alarm gave England such a Sense of the Consequence of the River Medway, and of the Docks and Yards at Chatham, and of the Danger the Royal Navy lay exposed to there, that all these Doors which were open then, are lock'd up and sufficient barr'd since that time; and 'tis not now in the Power of any Nation under Heaven, no, tho' they should be Masters at Sea, unless they were Masters at Land too at the same time, to give us such another Affront; for besides all the Castles, Lines of Guns, and Platforms on each side the River Medway, as we go up, as above; there is now a Royal Fort built at the Point of the I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of Shepey, call'd Sheerness, which guards that Entrance into the River: This is a regular, and so compleat a Fortification, and has such a Line of heavy Cannon commanding the Mouth of the River, that no Man of War, or Fleet of Men of War would attempt to pass by as the Dutch did; or at least cou'd not effect it without hazard of being torn to pieces by those Bat∣teries.</P>
<P>Sheerness is not only a Fortress, but a kind of Town with several Streets in it, and Inhabitants of several sorts▪ but chiefly such whose business obliges them to reside here: The Officers of the Ordnance have here Apartments, and an Office; they being often oblig'd to be here many Days together; especi∣ally in time of War, when the Rendez∣vous of the Fleet is at the Nore to see to the furnishing every Ship with Mili∣tary Stores as need requires, and to Cheque, the Officers of the Ships in
<PB REF="68" MS="y"/>
their Demands of those Stores, and the like.</P>
<P>Here is also a Yard for building Ships, with a Dock; the reason of which, is to repair any Ship speedily that may meet with any Accident, either riding at the Nore, or in any Service at Sea near the River. But then 'tis to be observ'd, that those are but for Fifth and Sixth Rate Ships, small Frigats, Yatchts, and such Vessels; at biggest, nothing above a Fourth Rate can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome in here. The Sheerness Galley, as I am told, was built here, and had her Name on that Occasi∣on. This Yard is a late thing also, and buil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many Years since the Fort.</P>
<P>This Fort Commands only the En∣trance into the Medway, or that Branch of the Medway, properly, which they call the West Swale. The East Swale, not Navigable by Ships of Force, goes in by the Town of Queenborough, passes East, makes the Isle of Shepey, parting it on the South side, and opens to the Sea, near Foversham, and Swale Cliff, and is therefore of small Consequence: As for the Expression of a certain Author, that Sheerness divides the Mouth of the Two Rivers, Thames and Medway, 'tis not said for want of Ignorance, and cannot be true in fact; the Mouth of the Med∣way opening into the Thames, and the Mouth of the Thames, not being with∣in Twenty Mile of it, (viz.) from the Nase and North Foreland.</P>
<P>At the South-West Point of the Isle of Shepey, where the East-Swale parts from the West, and passes on, as above, stands a Town memorable for nothing, but that which is rather a dishonour to our Country than otherwise: Namely, Queenborough; a miserable dirty, de∣cay'd, poor, pitiful, fishing Town; yet vested with Corporation Privileges, has a Mayor, Aldermen, &amp;c. and his Wor∣ship the Mayor has his Mace carry'd be∣fore him to Church, and attended in as much State and Ceremony as the Mayor of a Town Twenty times as good: I re∣member, when I was there, Mr. Mayor was a Butcher, and brought us a Shoulder of Mutton to our Inn himself in Person, which we bespoke for our Dinner, and afterwards he sat down and drank a Bot∣tle of Wine with us.</P>
<P>But that which is still worse and which I meant in what I said before, is, that this Town sends two Burgesses to Parliament, as many as the Burrough of Southwark, or the City of Westminste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Tho' it may be presumed all the Inhabi∣tants are not possess'd of Estates answer∣able to the Rent of one good House in either of those Places I last mentioned: The chief Business of this Town, as I could understand, consists in Ale-Houses, and Oyster-Catchers.</P>
<P>Here we took Boat, and went up the East Swale to a Town, which lies as it were hid in the County, and among the Creeks; for 'tis out of the way, and al∣most out of sight, as well by Water as by Land, I mean Milton; it lyes up so many Creeks and Windings of the Water, that no body <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees it by Water, but they who go on purpose ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the way to it; and as to the Road▪ it lyes also about a Mile on the Left-Hand of the Great Road, as we pass thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> no body sees it on that side neither▪ unless they go on purpose out of the Road to it; and yet it is a large Town, has a considerable Market, and especially for Corn, and Fruit, and Provisions, which they send to London by Water.</P>
<P>From hence following the Coast, and the Great Road together, for they are still within view of one another, we come to Feversham, a large Populous; and as some say, a rich Town: Tho' here is no particular remarkable Trade, either for Manufacture or Navigation; the prin∣cipal business we found among them, was Fishing for Oysters, which the Dutch fetch hence in such extraordinary quanti∣ties, that when I was there, we found Twelve large Dutch Hoys and Doggers lying there to load Oysters; and some∣times, as they told us, there are many more: This is greatly to the Advantage of the Place, as it employs abundance of Men and Boats in Drudging for the Oys∣ters, which they Catch in great plenty, in the Mouth of the East Swale; which,
<PB REF="69"/>
as I said above, enters in this Part of the Country into the Sea, and opens very wide.</P>
<P>It was at the Mouth of this Swale, namely at Shell-Ness, so call'd from the abundance of Oyster-Shells always lying there, that the Smack in which the late King James II. was em∣bark'd for his Escape into France, ran on shoar and being boarded by the Fisher∣men, the King was taken Prisoner; and I must mention it to the Reproach of the People of Feversham, let the Conduct of that Unfortunate Prince be what it will, that the Fishermen and Rabble can ne∣ver be excus'd, who treated the King, even after they were told who he was, with the utmost indecency, us'd his Majesty; (for he was then their Sove∣reign, even in the acknowledged Sense of his Enemies) I say, using him with such Indignity in his Person, such Inso∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence in their Behaviour, and giving him such Opprob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious and busive Language, and searching him in the rudest and most indecent manner, and indeed rifling him; that the King himself said, he was never more apprehensive of his Life than at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat time. He was afterwards carried <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y them up to the Town, where he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot much better treated for some time, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll some Neighbouring Gentlemen in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e County came in, who understood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Duty better, by whom he was at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast preserv'd from farther Violence till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaches and a Guard came from Lon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, by the Prince of Orange's Order, bring him with Safety and Freedom London; where he was at least for e present much better received, as in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e History of those Times is to be seen. While I was near this Town some ars ago, a most surprising Accident ppen'd, namely, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowing up of a wder Mill, which stood upon the Ri∣r, close to the Town; the Blast was t only frightful, but it shatter'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole Town, broke the Windows, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down Chimneys, and Gable-ends <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few; also several People were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Powder-House itself, tho' not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as I remember, in the Town: But what was most remarkable in it all, was, that the Eldest Son of the Master of the Powder-Mill, a Youth of about Fif een Years of Age, who was not in the Mill, or near it, when it blew up; but in a Boat upon the River, row<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> cross for his Diversion, was kill'd by a Piece of the building of the Mill, which blew up into the Air by the Force of the Pow∣der, and fell down upon him in the Boat: I know nothing else this Town is remarkable for, except the most notorious Smuggling Trade, carried on partly by the Assistance of the Dutch, in their Oyster-Boats, and partly by other Arts, in which they say, the People herea∣bouts are ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to such a Proficiency, that they are grown monstrous Rich by that wicked Trade; nay, even the Owl∣ing Trade (so they call the Clandestine Exporting of Wool) has seem'd to be transposed from Rum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey Marsh to this Coast, and a great deal of it has been carried on between the Mouth of the East Swale and the North Foreland.</P>
<P>As to the landing Goods here from Holland and France, such as Wine and Brandy from the latter, and Pepper, Tea, Coffee, Callicoes, Tobacco, and such Goods, (the Duties of which being very high in England, had first been drawn back by Debentures) that black Trade has not only been carried on here, as I was informed, but on both sides the Re∣ver, on the Essex as well as the Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish Shores, of which I shall speak again in its place.</P>
<P>From this East-Swale, and particu∣larly from these last Three Towns, Queenborough, Mil on, and Feversham, the Fish-Market at Billingsgate is sup∣ply'd with several sorts of Fish; but par∣ticularly with the best and largest Oys∣ters, such as they call Stewing Oysters; which are generally call'd Melton Oysters; some of which are exceeding large, as also with a very great quantity of others of a lesser size, as they are from the Essex Side, with a smaller and greener sort, call'd Wallfleet; so that the whole City of London is chiefly supplied with Oys∣ters from this Part of the Thames.</P>
<P><PB REF="70" MS="y"/>
From hence also are sent by Water to London very great quantities of Fruit; that is to say Apples, and Cherries; which are produc'd in this County, more than in any County in England, especially Cherries; and this leads me to cross the Hills from Milton to Maidstone, a Town on the River Medway, about Ten Miles distant.</P>
<P>This is a considerable Town, very po∣pulons, and the Inhabitants generally wealthy; 'tis the County Town, and the River Medway is Navigable to it by large Hoys, of 50 to 60 Tuns Burthern, the Tide flowing quite up to the Town; round this Town are the largest Cherry Orchards, and the most of them that are in any Part of England; and the Gross of the quantity of Cherries, and the best of them which supply the whole City of London come f om hence, and are therefore call'd Kentish Cherries.</P>
<P>Here likewise, and in the Country adjacent, are great quantities of Hops planted, and this is call'd the Mother of Hop Grounds in England; being the first Place in England, where Hops were planted in any quantity, and long before any were planted at Canterbury, tho' that be now supposed to be the Chief Place in England, as shall be observ'd in its Place: These were the Hops, I suppose, which were planted at the be∣ginning of the Reformation, and which gave occasion to that Old Distich▪</P>
<Q><L>Hops, Reformation, Bays, and Beer,</L>
<L>Came into England all in a Year.</L></Q>
<P>Maidstone is eminent for the Plenty of Provisions, and richness of Lands in the Country all around it, and for the best Market in the County, not Rochester, no not Canterbury excepted.</P>
<P>From this Town, and the Neighbour∣ing Parts, London is supplied with more Particulars than from any single Market Town in England; which I mention in pursuance of my first Resolution of ob∣serving, how every Part of England fur∣nishes something to the City of Lon∣don.</P>
<P N="1">1. From the Wild of Kent, which be∣gins but about Six Miles off, and parti∣cularly from that Part which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way; they bring the large Kentish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> locks, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m'd for being all Red, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Horns crooked inward, the tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> points standing one directly against th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other, they are counted the largest Bree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in England.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the same Country are brought great quantites of the largest Timber for supply of the King's Yards at Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham and often to London; most of which comes by Land Carriage to Maidstone.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the Country adjoining to Maid∣stone, also is a very great quantity of Corn brought up to London, besides Hops and Cherries, as above.</P>
<P N="4">4. Also a kind of Paving Stone, about Eight to Ten Inches quare, so durable that it scarce ever wears out, 'tis used to pave Court-yards, and Passages to Gentlemens Houses, being the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Royal Exchange at London is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which has never yet wanted the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Repair.</P>

<P N="6">6. Also very great quantities of Fruit, such as Kentish Pipi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Runetts, &amp;c. which come up as the Cherries do, whole Hoy-Loads at a time to the Wharf, call'd the Three Cranes, in London; which is the greatest Pipin Market per∣haps in the World.</P>
<P>At Maidstone you begin to Converse with Gentlemen, and Persons of Rank of both Sexes, and some of Quality: All that side of the County which I have mentioned already, as it is Marshy, and unhealthy, by its Situation among the Waters; so is it embarass'd with Business and inhabited chiefly by Men of Business, such as Ship Builders; Fishermen, Sea∣faring-Men, Husbend-Men, or such as

depend upon them, and very few Fami∣ies of Note are found among them. But os soon as we come down Boxley-Hill from Rochester, or Hollingbourn-Hill, from Milton, and descend from the poor chalky Downs, and deep foggy Marshes, to the wholesome rich Soil, the well-wooded, and well watered Plain on the Banks of the Medway, we find the Country every where spangled with populous Villages, and delicious Se ts of the Nobility and Gentry; and especially in the North-side of the River, begin∣ning at Aylesford, on the Medway, and lo king East towards th Sea: I his Ayles∣ford was form rly the Seat of Sir John B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and since descended, by his Daugh∣ter, to Heneage Lord Fench, Brother to the Earl of Not<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingham, and created Earl of Aylesford, which Estate he came to in Right of his said Lady: The Gen∣try this way, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull of Gentle∣smens Houses, reckoning from this Ayles∣ford, below Maidstone, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Medway to Eastwell, near Ashf rd, the Seat of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Earl of Winchelsea, another Noble Family of the Name of Finch also; tho' not nearly allied to the Not ingham House.</P>

<P>This Neighbourhood of Persons of Figure and Quality, makes Maidstone a very agreeable Place to live in, and where a Man of Letters, and Manners, will always find suitable Society, both to divert and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove himself; so that here is, what is not often found, namely, a town of very great Business and Trade, and yet full of Gentry, of Mirth, and of good Company.</P>
<P>It is to be recorded h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re for the Ho∣nour of the Gentry in this Part of Eng∣land; that tho' they are as sociable and entertaining as any People are, or can be desired to be, and as much famed for good Manners, and good Humour; yet the new Mode of forming Assemblies so much, and so fatally now in Vogue, in other Parts of England, could never pre∣vail here; and that tho' there was an Attempt made by some l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose Persons, and the Gentlemen, and Ladies, did for a little while appear there; yet they ge∣nerally dislik'd the practice, soon de∣clin'd to give their Company, as to a Thing scandalous, and so it drop'd of course.</P>
<P>There is not much Manufacturing in this County; what is left, is chiefly at Canterbury, and in this Town of Maidstone, and the Neighbourhood; the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act re of this Town is principally in Thread, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o say, Linnen Thread, which they make to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y good per ec∣tion, tho` not extraordinary fine.

<P>In Prosecution of my Journey East▪ I went from hence to Canterbury; of which Town and its Antiquities so much has been said, and so accurately, that I need do no more then mention it by Recapitu∣lation; for, as I have said, the Antiqui∣ties, and Histories of particular Places is not my business here, so much as the p esent State of them, However I ob∣serve here,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. That, seven Bishops of Canterbury, from St. Augustine, inclusive of himself, lie bury'd here in one Vault.</P>

<P N="4">4. That the first of these, having made himself intolerable to King Henry II. by his Obstinacy, Pride and Rebellion was here murder'd by the Connivance, and as some say, by the Express Order of the King, and that they shew his Blood upon the Pavement to this day.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P>The City, will scarce bear being call'd Populous, were it not for Two or Three Thousand French Protestants, which, in∣cluding Men, Women and Children, they say there are in it, and yet the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tell me the Number of these decreases Daily.</P>
<P>The Employment of those Refugees was chiefly Broad Silk Weaving; but that Trade was so decay'd before the first Act for Prohibiting the Wearing of East <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndia Silks pass'd, that there were not Twenty Broad Looms left in the City, of near Three Hundred that had the Ci∣ty, of near Three Hundred that had formerly been there; upon the Passing that Act, the Trade reviv'd again, and the Number of Master Work Men en∣creas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and the Masters en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ased; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which were there before, encreasing their Works also, the Town fill'd again, and a great many Looms were employ'd; but after this by the encroaching of the Printed Callicoes, Chints, &amp;c. and the prevailing of the Smuggling Trade as above, the Silk T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade decay'd a Second time. But now the Use and Wear of printed Callicoes and Chints, being by Act of Parliament severely prohibited, 'tis expected the Silk Trade at Canterbury will revive a Third time, and the Inhabitants promise themselves much from it.</P>
<P>But the great Wealth and Encrease of the City of Canterbury, is from the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣prizing Encrease of the Hop Grounds all round the Place; it is within the Me∣mory of many of the Inhabitants now living, and that none of the oldest nei∣ther, that there was not an Acre of Ground planted with Hops in the whole Neighbourhood, or so few as not to be wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h naming; whereas I was assured that there are at this time near Six Thou∣sand Acres of Ground so planted, within a very few Miles of the City; I do not vouch the Number, and I confess it seems incredible, but I deliver it as I receiv'd it.</P>
<P>It is observ'd that the Ground round this City proves mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e particularly fruitful for the growth of Hops than of any other production, which was not at first known, but which, upon its being discover'd, set all the World, speaking in the Language of a Neighbourhood, a digging up their Grounds and Planting; so that now they may say without boasting, there is at Canterbury the greatest Plantation of Hops in the whole Island.</P>

<P>The Shore from Whitstable, and the East-Swale, affords nothing remarkable but Sea-Marks and small Towns on the Coast, 'till we come to Margate and the North Foreland; the Town of Margate is Eminent for nothing that I know of, but for King William's frequently Land∣ing here in his returns from Holland, and for Shipping a vast quantity of Corn for London Market, most, if not all of it, the Product of the Isle of Thanes, in which it stands.</P>
<P>On the North-East Point of this Land, is the Promontory, or Head-land which I have often mentioned, call'd the North Foreland; which, by a Line drawn due North to the Nase in Essex, about Six Miles short of Harwich, makes the Mouth of the River Thames, and the Port of London: As soon as any Vessels pass this Foreland from London, they are properly said to be in the open Sea; if to the North they enter the German Ocean, if to the South, the Chanel, as it is called, that is, the Narrow Seas between D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gland and France; and all the Towns or Harbours before we c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me this Length, whether on the Ken<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish or Essex Shoar, are called Members of the Port of London.</P>
<P>From this Point Westward, the first Town of Note is Ramsgate, a small Port, the Inhabitants are mighty fond of having us call it Roman's-Gate, pretend∣ing that the Romans, under Julius Cae∣sar, made teeir first Attempt to l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd here, when he was driven back by a Storm; but soon returned, and coming on Shore with a good Body of Troops beat back the Britains, and fortify d his Camp just at the Entrance of the Creek, where the Town now stands; all which may be true, for ought any one knows, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut is not to be proved, either by the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or any one else; and is of so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>le Concern to us, that it matters nothing whether here or at Deal, where others pretend it was.</P>
<P>It was from this Town of Ramsgate, that a Fellow of Gagantick Strength, though not of extraordinary Stature, came abroad in the World, and was called the English Sampson, and who suffered Men to fasten the strongest Horse they could find, to a Rope, and the Rope round his Loins, sitting on the Ground, with his Feet strait out against a Post, and no Horse could stir him; several other Proofs of an incredible Strength, he gave before the King, and abundance of the Nobility, at Kensington, which no other Man could equal; but his History was very short, for in about a Year he disappeared, and we heard no more of him since</P>

<P>Sometimes, and when the Wind pre∣sents fair, Ships do come in here, and pass thro' at once, without coming <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o an Anc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or; for they are not oblig'd to stop, but for their own Convenience: This Place would be a very Wild and Den∣gerous Road for Ships, were it not for the South Foreland, a Head of Land forming the East Point of the Kentish Shoar; and is called, the South, as its Situation respects the North Foreland; and which breaks the Sea off, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h would otherwise come rowling up from the West, this and a Flat, or the Bank of Sands, which for Three Leagues toge∣ther, and at about a League, or League and half distance run parallel with the Shore, and are dry at low Water, these two, I say, break all the Force of the Sea, on the East and South, and South-West; so that the Downs is counted a very good Road.</P>
<P>And yet on some particular Winds, and especially, if they over-blow, the Downs proves a very wild Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, Ships are driven f om their An ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and often run o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shoar or are forced on the said Sands, or into S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dwich-Bay or Ram<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gate-Peer, as above, in grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distress; this is particula<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly when the Wind blows hard at S. E or at E. by N. or E. N. E and some other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oints; and terrible ha∣vock has been made in the Downs at such times.</P>
<P>But the most unhappy Account that can be given of any Disaster in the Downs, is in the time of that terrible Tempest, which we call by way of dis∣tinction, The great Storm, being on 27th of November 1703, unhappy in particular; for that there chanced just at that time to be a great part of the Royal Navy under Sir Cloudesly Shovel, just come into the Downs, in their way to Chatham, to be l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id up</P>
<P>Five of the biggest Ships had the good hap o push th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Downs the Day before, finding the Wind then blow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery hard, and were come to an Anchor at the Gunsheet; and had they had but one fair Day more, they had been all safe at at the Nore, or in the River Medway at Blackstakes.</P>
<P>There remain'd in the Downs about Twelve Sail when this terrible blast be∣gan, at which time England may be said to have received the greatest Loss that ever happen'd to the Royal Navy at onetime; either by Weather, by Ene∣mies, or by any Accident whatsoever; the short account of it, as they shewed it me in the Town, I mean of what hap∣pened in the Downs, is as follows</P>
<P>The Northumberland, a Third Rate, carrying 70 Guns, and 353 Men; the Restoration a Second Rate, carrying 76 Guns, and 386 Men; the Sterling-Cas∣tle, a Second Rate, carrying 80 Guns, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 Men, but had but 349 Men on board; and the Mary, a Third Rate, of 64 Guns, having 273 Men on board; these were all Lost, with all their M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, high and low; except only one Man, out of the Mary, and 70 Men out of the Sterling-Castle, who were taken up by Boats from Deal.</P>
<P>All this was besides the Loss of Mer∣chants Ships, which was exceeding great, not here only, but in almost all the Por<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the South, and West of England; and
<PB REF="76" MS="y"/>
also in Ireland, which I shall have Occasion to mention again in another Place.</P>
<P>From hence we pass over a pleasant Champian Country, with the Sea, and the Coast of France, clear in your view, and by the very Gates of the ancient Castle (to the Town) of Dover: As we go we pass by Deal Castle, and Sandown Castle, two small Works, of no Strength by Land, and not of so much use by Sea; but however maintain'd by the Government for the Ordinary Servi∣ces of Salutes, and protecting small Vessels, which can lie safe under their Cannon from Picaroons, Privateers, &amp;c. in time of War.</P>
<P>Neither Dover nor its Castle has any Thing of Note to be said of them, but what is in common with their Neigh∣bours: the Castle is old, useless decay'd, and serves for little; but to give the Ti∣tle and Honour of Government to Men of Quality, with a Salary, and sometimes to those that want one.</P>
<P>The Town, is one of the Cinque Ports, sends Members to Parliament, who are call'd Barons, and has itself an ill repair'd, dangerous, and good for little Harbour and Peir, very chargeable and little worth. The Packets for France go off here as also those for Nieuport, with the Mails for Flanders, and all those Ships which carry Freights from New York to Holland, and from Virginia to Holland, come ge∣nerally hither, and unlade their Goods, Enter them with, and show them to the Custom-house Officers, pay the Duties, and then Enter them again by Certifi∣cate, Reload them, and draw back the Duty by Debenture, and so they go away for Holland.</P>
<P>In the time of the late War with France, here was a large Victualling. Office keps for the Navy, and a Com∣missioner appointed to manage it, as there was also at Chatham, Portsmouth, other Places; but this is now unem∣ploy'd: The Duke of Queensberry in Scotland, who was Lord Commissioner to the Parliament there, at the time of making the Union, was after the said Union created Duke of Dover, which Title is possess'd now by his So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P><PB REF="77" MS="y"/>
But I find so many of these desperate Follows are of late taken up, by the Courage and Vigilance of the Soldiers, that the Knots are very much broken, and the Owling-Trade much abated, at least on that side; the French also find∣ing means to be supply'd from Ireland with much less Hazard, and at very lit∣tle more Expence.</P>
<P>From Rumney-Marsh the Shoar <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it self a great way into the Sea, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Point of Land, call'd Dengey-N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; between this Point of Land and Beachy, it was that the French in the height of their Naval glory took the English and Dutch Fleets at some disadvantage, offering them Battle, when the French were so superior in Number, that it was not consistent with Humane Prudence to venture an Engagement, the French being Ninety to Ships of the Line of Battle, and the English and Dutch, put together, not Sixty Sail; the French Ships also generally bigger: yet such was the eagerness of both the Englsh and Dutch Seamen, and Commanders, that it was not withont Murmurings, that Admiral Herbert stood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way, and call'd off the Dutch, who had the Van, from Engaging; the English it seems be∣liev'd themselves so superiour to the French when they came to lye Broad-side and Broad-side, Yard-arm and Yard-arm, as the Seamen call it in an En∣gagement, that they would admit of no Excuse for not Fighting; tho' according to all the Rules of War, no Admiral could justify hazarding the Royal Navy on such Terms; and especialy the Cir∣cumstances of the Time then considered, for the King was in Ireland, and King James ready in France, if the English and Dutch Fleets had received a blow, to have Embark'd with an Army for England, which perhaps would have hazarded the whole Revolution; so that Wise Men afterwards, and as I have been told, the King himself upon a full hear∣ing justify'd the Conduct of Admiral Herbert, and afterwards Created him Earl of Torrington.</P>
<P>Here, or rather a little farther, we say the Bones of one of the Dutch Men of War, which was Burnt and Strand∣ed by the French in that Action; the Towns of Rye, Winc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sea, and Hast∣ings, have little in them to deserve more than a bare mention; Rye would flourish again, if her Harbour, which was once able to receive the Royal Navy, cou'd be restor'd; but as it is, the Bar is so loaded with Sand cast up by the Sea, that Ships nf 200 Tun chuse to ride it out under De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gey or Beachy▪ tho' with the greatest danger, rather than to run the hazard of going into Rye for shel∣ter: It is true, ther is now an Act of Parliament pass'd for the restoring this Port to its former State, when a Man of War of 70 Guns might have safely gone in; but 'tis very doubtful, whether it will be effectual to the main End or no, after so long a time.</P>
<P>Indeed our Merchant Ships are often put to great Extremity hereabout, for there is not one safe Place for them to run into, between Portsmouth and the Downs; whereas in former Days, Rye-Bay was an Asylum, a safe Harbour, where they could go boldly in, and ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e safe all Weathers, and then go to Sea a∣gain at pleasure.</P>
<P>I rom a little beyond Hastings to Bourn, we ride upon the Sands in a strait Line for eighteen Miles, all upon the Coast of Sussex, passing by Pemsey, or Pevensey Haven, and the Mouth of the River, which cometh from Battle, without so much as knowing that there was a River, the Tide being out, and all the Water of the ordinary Chanel of the River sinking away in the Sand: This is that famou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Strand, where William the Norman lan∣ded with his whole Army; and near to which, namely, at the Town of Battle above-named, which is about nine Miles off, he fought that memorable Fight with Harold then King of England; in which the Fate of this Nation was determined, and where Victory gave the Crown to the Conqueror and his Race; of the Par∣ticulars of all which, our Historians are full.</P>
<P><PB REF="78" MS="y"/>
This Town of Battle is remarkable for little now, but for making the finest Gun-Powder, and the best perhaps in Europe. Near this Town of Battle, they show us a Hill with a Beacon upon it, which since the Beacon was set up in∣deed has been call'd Beacon Hill, as is usual in such cases; but was before that call'd Standard▪Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, being the place where William the Conqueror set up his Great Standard of Defiance, the Day before the great Battle with Harold and the English.</P>
<P>From the beginning of Rumney Marsh, that is to say, at Sandgate, or Sand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot Castle near Hith, to this Place, the Coun∣try is a rich Fertile Soil, full of feeding Grounds, and where an infinite number of large Sheep are fed every Year, and sent up to London Market; these Rum∣ney Marsh Sheep, are counted rather lar∣ger than the Leicester-shire and Lincoln∣shire Sheep, of which so much is said else-where.</P>
<P>Besides the vast quantity of Sheep as above, abundance of large Bullocks are fed in this part of the Country; and es∣pecially those they call Stall'd Oxen, that is, House fed, and kept within the Far∣mers Sheds or Yards, all the latter Sea∣son, where they are fed for the Winter Market. This I noted, because these Oxen are generally the largest Beef in England.</P>
<P>From hence it was that, turning North, and traversing the deep, dirty, but rich Part of these two Counties, I had the curiosity to see the great Foun∣daries, or Iron-Works, which are in this County, and where they are carrv'd on at such a prodigious Expence of Wood, that even in a Country almost all over∣run with Timber, they began to com∣plain of the consuming it fot those Fur∣naces, and leaving the next Age to want Timber for building their Navies; I must own however, that I found that Com∣plaint perfectly groundless, the Three Countries of Kent, Sussex, and Hamp∣shire, (all which lye contiguous to one another) being one in-exhaustible Store-House of Timber never to be destroy'd, but by a general Conflagration, and able at this time to supply Timber to rebuild all the Royal Navies in Europe, if hey were all to be destroy'd, and set about the building them together.</P>
<P>After I had fatigued my self i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng this deep and heavy part of the Country, I thought it would not be Foreign to my design, if I refres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d my self with a view of Tunbridge Wells, which were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then above Twelve Miles out of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y way.</P>
<P>When I came to the wells, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Five Miles nearer to me than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> supposing me then at Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ward of them; I found a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> good Company the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was more particular, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be at the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Highness the Prince of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with abundance of the Nobility, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gentry of the Country, who to Honour the Prince's coming, or satisfy their own Curiosity, throng'd to that Place; so that at first I found it very difficult to get a Lodging.</P>
<P>The Prince appeared upon the Walks, went into the Raffling Shops, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o e∣very body see him, and went away, with the Duke of Dorset, and o h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of his Attendance for Por<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>smouth; so in two or three Days, things retu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed all to their Antient Chan I, and Tunbridge was just what it used to be.</P>
<P>The Ladies that appear here, are in∣deed the glory of the Place, the coming to the Wells to drink the Water is a meet matter of Custom; some drink, more do not, and few drink Phisically: But Com∣pany and Diver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in short the main business of the Place; and those People who have nothing to do any where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, seem to be the only People who have a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y thing to do at Tunbridge.</P>
<P>After the Appearance is over at the Wells, (where the Ladies are all undres∣sed) and at the Chapel, the Company go home; and as if it was an ther Species of People, or a Collection from another Place, you are surpriz'd t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Walks covered with Ladies compl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atly dress'd and gay to profusion; where rich Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths, Jewels,

and Beauty not to be set out out by (but infinitely above) Ornament, dazzles the Eyes from one end of the Range to the other.</P>
<P>Here you have all Liberty of Con∣versation in the World, and any thing that looks like a Gentleman, has an ad∣dress agreeable, and behaves with de∣cency and good Manners, may single out whom he pleases, that does not ap∣pear engag'd, and may talk, rally, be merry, and say any decent thing to to them; but all this makes no Acquain∣tance, nor is taken so, or understood to mean so; if a Gentleman desires to be more intimate, and enter into any Acquaintance particular he must do it by proper Application, not by the Ladies will ask no Gentleman there, to go off of the Walk, or invite any one to their Lodgings, except it be a sort of Ladies of whom I am not now speaking</P>
<P>As for Gaming, Sharping, Intriegu∣ing; as also Fops; Fools, Beaus, and the like, Tunbridge is as full of these, as can be desired, and it takes off much of the Diversion of those Persons of Honour and Virtue, who go there to be inno∣cently recreated: However a Man of Character, and good behaviour cannot be there any time, but he may single out such Company as may be suitable to him, and with whom he may be as merry as Heart can wish.</P>
<P>The Air here is excellent good, the Country Healthful, and the Provisions of all sorts very reasonable, Particular∣ly, they are supply'd with excellent Fish, and that of almost all sorts, from Rye, and other Towns on the Sea-Coast; and I saw a Turbut of near 20 l. weight told there for 3 s.: In the Season of Mack∣arel, they have them here from Hast∣ings, within three Hours of their being taken out of the Sea, and the difference which that makes in their goodness, I need not mention.</P>
<P>They have likewise here abundance of Wild-Fowl, of the best sorts; such as Pheasant, Partridge, Woodcock, Snipe, Quails, Duck, Mallard, Teal &amp;c. par∣ticularly they have from the South-Dows, the Bird call'd a Wheatear, or as we may call them, the English Ortolans, the most delicious Taste for a Creature of one Mouthful, for 'tis little more, that can be imagin'd; but these are very dear at Tunbridge, they are much Cheaper at Seaford, Lewis, and that side of the Country.</P>
<P>In a word, Tunbridge wants nothing that can add to the Felicities of Life, or that can make a Man or Woman com∣pleatly happy, always provided they have Money; for without Money a Man is no-body at Tunbridge, any more than at any other Place; and when any Man finds his Pockets low, he has nothing left to think of but to be gone, for he will have no Diversion in staying there any longer.</P>
<P>And yet at Tunbridge also is a Place in which a Lady however Virtuous, yet for want of good Conduct may as soon Shipwreck her Character as in any part of England, and where, when she has once injur'd her Reputation, 'tis as hard to restore it; nay, some say no Lady ever recover'd her Character at Tunbride, if she first wounded it there: But this is to be added too, that a Lady very seldom suffers that way at Tunbridge, without some apparent Folly of her own; for that they do not seem so apt to make havock of one another's Reputation here, by Tattle and Slander, as I think they do in some other Places in the World; par∣ticularly at Epsome, Hampstead, and such like Places; which I take to be be∣cause the Company who frequent Tun∣bridge, seem to be a Degree or two a∣bove the Society of those other Places, and therefore are not so very apt, either to meddle with other Peoples Affairs, or to Censure if they do; both which are the Properties of that more Gossiping Part of the World.</P>
<P>In this I shall be much misunderstood, if it is thought I mean the Ladies only, for I must own I look just the other way; and if I may be allow'd to use my own Sex so Coursly, it is really among them that the Ladies Characters first, and oftnest receive unjust Wounds; and I

<P>I left Tunbridge, for the same Reason that I give, why others should leave it, when they are in my Condition; namely, that I found my Money almost gone; and tho' I had Bills of Credit to supply my self in the Course of my intended Journey; yet I had none there; so I came away, or as they call it there, I retir'd; and came to Lewis, through the deepest, dir∣tiest, but many ways the richest, and most profitable Country in all that part of England.</P>
<P>The Timber I saw here was prodigi∣ous, as well in quantity as in bigness, and seem'd in some Places to be suffer'd to grow, only because it was so far off of any Navigation, that it was not worth cutting down and carrying away; in dry Summers, indeed a great deal is car∣ry'd away to Maidstone, and other Pla∣ces on the Medway; and sometimes I have seen one Tree on a Carriage, which they call there a Tug, drawn by Two and Twenty Oxen, and even then, 'tis carry'd so little a way, and then thrown down, and left for other Tugs to take up and carry on, that sometimes 'tis Two or Three Years before it gets to Chat∣ham; for if once the Rains come in, it stirs no more that Year, and sometimes a whole Summer is not dry enough to make the Roads passable: Here I had a sight, which indeed I never saw in any other Part of England: Namely, that going to Church at a Church at a Coun∣try Village, not far from Lewis, I saw an ancient Lady, and a Lady of very good Quality, I assure you, drawn to Church in her Coach with Six Oxen; nor was it done in Frolick or Humour, but meer Necessity, the Way being so stiff and deep, that no Horses could go in it.</P>
<P>Lewis is a fine pleasant Town, well built, agreeably situated in the middle of an open Champaign Country and on the Edge of the South Downs, the pleasantest, and most delightful of their kind in the Nation; it lies on the Bank of a little wholsom fresh River, within Twelve Miles of the Sea; but that which adds to the Character of this Town, is, that both the Town and the Country adja∣cent, is full of Gentlemen of good Fa∣milies and Fortunes of which the Pel∣hams may be named with the first, whose Chief was by King William made a Baron, and whose eldest Son succeed∣ing to the greatest part of the Estate of that English Crassus, the late Duke of Newcastle, has since brought the Title and Honour of Newcastle to the House; of Pelham. Here are also the ancient Families of Gage, Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, &amp;c. formerly Roman, but now Protestant, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h many others</P>
<P>From this Town, following still the Range of the South Downs, West; we ride in view of the Sea, and on a fine Carpet Ground, for about Twelve Miles to Bright Helmston, commonly call'd Bredhemston, a Poor fishing Town old Built, and on the very edge of the Sea: Here again, as I mention'd at Folkstone and Dover, the Fishermen having large Barks go away to Yarmouth, on the Coast of Norfolk, to the Fishing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air there, and hire themselves sot the Season to Catch Herrings for the Merchants; and
<PB REF="81" MS="y"/>
they tell us, that these make a very good Business of it.</P>
<P>The Sea is very unkind to this Town, and has, by its continual Encroachments, so gain'd upon them, that in a little Time more, they might reasonably ex∣pect it would eat up the whole Town, above a Hundred Houses having been devoured by the Water in a few Years past; they are now obliged to get a Brief granted them, to beg Money all over England, to raise Banks against the Water; the Expence of which, the Brief expressly says, will be eight Thousand Pounds; which if one were to look on the Town, would seem to be more than all the Houses in it are worth.</P>
<P>From thence, still keeping the Coast close on the Town, we come to S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore∣ham, a Sea-faring Town, and chiefly in∣habitted by Ship Carpenters, Ship Chand∣lers, and all the several Trades depend∣ing upon the Building and Fitting up of Ships, which is their chief Business; and they are fam'd for neat Building, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for Building good Sea-Boats; that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to say, Ships that are wholesome in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Sea, and good Sailors; but for strong Building, they do not come up to Yar∣nouth, Ipswich, and the North.</P>
<P>The Builders of Ships seemed to plant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere, chiefly, because of the exceeding Quantity and Cheapness of Timber in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Country behind them; being the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame wooded Country I mentioned a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove, which still continues through this County, and the next also: The River his Town stands upon, though not Na∣igable for large Vessels, yet serves them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bring down this large Timber in Floats <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om Bramber, Stenning, and the Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y adjacent; which is as it were all co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered with Timber</P>
<P>Here, in the Compass of about six <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles, are three Borough Towns, send∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Members to Parliament, viz. Shore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, Bramber, and Stennings: Shore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m and Stenning are tollerable little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arket-Towns; but Bramber (a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uin of an old Castle excepted) hardly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serves the Name of a Town, having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t above 15 or 16 Families in it, and of them not many above asking you an Alms as you ride by; the chiefest House in the Town is a Tavern, and here, as I have been told, the Vintner, or Ale-House-Keeper rather, for he hardly de∣serves the Name of a Vintner, boasted, that upon an Election (just then over) he had made 300 l. of one Pipe of Ca∣nary.</P>
<P>This is the second Town in this Coun∣ty, where the Elections have been so scandaloussy Mercenary; and of whom it is said, there was, in one King's Reign, more Money spent in Elections, than all the Lands in the Parishes were worth, at Twenty Years Purchase; the other Town, I mean, is Winchelsea, a Town, if it deserves the Name of a Town, which is rather the Skeleton of an antient City than a real Town, where the antient Gates stand near three Miles from one another over the Fields, and where the Ruins are so bury'd that they have made good Corn Fields of the Streets, and the Plow goes over the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oundations, nay, over the first Floo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the House, and where nothing of a Town but the Destruction of it seems to remain; yet at one Election for this Town the Strife was such, between Sir John Banks, Father-in-Law to the Earl of Aylesford, and Colonel Draper, a neighbouring Gentleman, that I was told in the Country, the latter spent 11000 l. at one Election, and yet lost it too; what the other spent who opposed him, may be guessed at, seeing he that spent most was always sure to carry it in those Days.</P>
<P>Bramber is the very Exemplification of this, with this difference only, namely, that at the former they have given it over, at the latter it seems to be rather worse than ever.</P>
<P>Near Stenning, the famous Sir John Fagg had a no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le antient Seat, now possessed, with a vast Est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, by his Grandson, Sir Rober Fagg, but I men∣tion the antient Gentleman on this occa∣sion, that being entertained at his House, in the Year 1697, he showed me, in his Park, some Bullocks of his own
<PB REF="82" MS="y"/>
Breeding, and of his own Feeding, of so prodigious a size, and so excessively over-grown by Fat, that I never saw any thing like them; and the Bullock which Sir Edward Blacket, in Yorkshire, near Rippon, Fed, and caused to be shew'd about for a Sight at Newcastle upon Tyne, was not any way equal to the least of them, nor had it so much Flesh on it by near Twenty Stone a Quar∣ter.</P>
<P>While I continu'd at Sir John's, some London Butchers came down to see them, and in my hearing offer'd Sir John Six and Twenty Pound a Head for them, but he refused it; and when I mov'd him afterward to take the Money, he said No, he was resov'd to have them to Smithfield himself, that he might say he had the four biggest Bullocks in Eng∣land at Market.</P>
<P>He continued positive, and did go up to Smithfield Market with them; but whether it was that they sunk a little in the driving, or that the Butchers play'd a little upon him, I cannot tell; but he was obliged to sell them for Twenty Five Pound a Head when he came there: I knew one of the Butchers that bought them, and on a particular Occasion en∣quir'd of him what they weigh'd when kill'd, and he assur'd me that they weigh'd eighty Stone a Quarter, when kill'd and cut out; which is so incredible, that if I had not been well assur'd of the Truth of it, I should not have ventur'd thus to have record it: But by this may be judg'd something of the largeness of the Cattle in the Wild of Kent and Sussex, for it is all the same, of which I men∣tion'd something before, and for this reason I tell the Story.</P>
<P>From hence we come to Arundel, a decay'd Town also; but standing near the Mouth of a good River, call'd Arun, which signifies, says Mr. Cambden, the swift, tho' the River it self is not such a Rapid Current as merits that Name; at least it did not seem to be so to me.</P>
<P>The principal advantage to the Coun∣try from this River, is the Shipping off great quantities of large Timber here which is carry'd up the Thames to Wool∣wich and Deptford, and up the Med∣way to Chatham; as also Westward to Portsmouth, and even to Plymouth, to the New Dock there, this is to say, it goes to all the King's Yards, where the Business of the Navy is carry'd on: The Timber shipped off here is esteem'd the best, as it is also the largest that is brought by Sea from any part of England; also great quantities of Knee Timber is had here, which is valuable in its kind above the strait Timber, being not only necessary, but scarce, I mean that which is very large.</P>
<P>This River, and the old decay'd, once famous Castle as Arundel, which are still belonging to the Family of Howards, Earl of Arundel, a Branch of the Norfolk Family, is all that is remrrkable here; except it be that in this River are catch'd the best Mullets, and the largest in Eng∣land, a Fish very good in it self, and of∣ten up to London.</P>
<P>From hence to the City of Chiche∣ster Twelve Miles, and the most plea∣sant beautiful County in England, whe∣ther we go by the Hill, that is the Downs, or by the Plain (viz.) the en∣closed Country. To the North of A∣rundel, and at the bottom of the Hills, and consequently in the Wild, is the Town of Petworth, a large handsome Country Market Town, and very popu∣lous, and as it stands upon an Ascent, and is dry and healthy, it is full of Gen∣tlemens Families, and good well built Houses both in the Town and Neigh∣bourhood; but the beauty of Petworth, is the ancient Seat of the old Family of Peircy, Earls of Northumberland now extinct; whose Daughter, the sole Heiress of all his vast Estates, marry'd the present Duke of Somerset; of the noble and ancient Family of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and among other noble Seats brough his Grace this of Petworth.</P>
<P>The Duke pull'd down the ancie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House, and on the same Spot has bui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Ground, one of the finest Pile of Building, and the best model'd House
<PB REF="83" MS="y"/>
then in Britain: It has had the Misfor∣tune to be once almost demolish'd by Fire, but the damage is fully repair'd; but another Disaster to the Family can never be repaired which has happen'd to it, even while these Sheets were writ∣ing: Namely, the Death of the Dutchess, who dy'd in November 1722, and lies buried in the Burying Place of the Fa∣mily of Seymour, Dukes of Some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>et, in in the Cathedral Church of Salisbury.</P>
<P>Her Grace was happy in a numerous Issue, as well as in a noble Estate; and besides two Sons and one Daughter, which lie bury d with her, has left one Son and—Daughters still living. I shall have occasion to mention the Nor∣thumberland Estate again, when I come to speak of the other fine Seats, which the Duke enjoys in right of his late Dutchess, and the old Castles which were formerly part of that Northumberland Estate.</P>
<P>The Duke's House at Petworth is certainly a compleat Building in itself, and the Apartments are very noble, well contriv'd, and richly furnish'd, but it cannot be said, that the Situation of the House is equally design'd, or with equal Judgment as the rest; the Avenues to the Front went space, the House stands as it were with its Elbow to the Town its Front has no Visto answerable, and the West Front look'd not to the Parks on fine Gardens, but to the old Stables.</P>
<P>To rectify this, when it was too late <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o order it any other way, the Duke was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blig'd to pull down those noble Build∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs: I mean the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ws, or Stables, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nest of their kind in all the South of England and equal to some Noblemens <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole Houses, and yet even the demo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shing the Pile has done no more than pen'd a Prospect over the Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hereas had the House been set on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing Ground, on the side of the Park, ver-against the North Wing of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse, and a little more to the West∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, the Front had been South to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, the back Front to the Parks, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich were capable of Fountains, Ca∣nals, Vistos, and all the most exquisite Pieces of Art, that sets out the finest Gardens, whereas all now lies on one Angle, or opposite to one Wing of the House.</P>
<P>But with all these disadvantages, the House itself is a noble Pile of Building, and by far the finest in all this Part of Britain. From Petwo th West, the Coun∣try is a little less Woody than the Wild, and there begin to show their Heads above the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ees, a great many fine Seats of the Nobility and Gentlemen of the Country, as the Duke of Richmond's Seat at Goodwood, near Chichester, (This Family also is in Tears, at the writing these Sheets, for the Death of her Grace the Dutchess, who dyed the beginning of the Month of December, and is bury'd in Westminster Abbey; and here the Year closing I think 'tis very remarkable, that this Year 1722, no l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s than five Dukes and two Dutches∣ses are dead (viz) The Dukes of Bucks, Bolton, Ru land Manchester, and Marl∣borough and the Dutchesses of Somerset and Richmond; besides Earls, viz. the Earl of Sunderland, of Stamford, Exeter, and others; and since the above was written to the Press, the Duke of Rich∣mond is also Dead.) The Seats of the late Earl of Tankerville, and the Earl of Scarboro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh, the ancient House of the Lord Montacu e at Midhurst, an ancient Family of the Sirname of Brown, the eldest Branch of the House. There and a great many more lying so near toge∣ther, make the Country hereabout much more sociable and pleasant then the rest of the Woody Country, call'd The Wild, of which I have made mention so often; and yet I cannot say much for the City of Chichester, in which, if Six or Seven good Families were removed, there would not be much Conversation, except what is to be found among the Canons, and Dignitaries of the Cathedral.</P>
<P>The Cathedral here is not the finest in England, but is far from being the most ordinary: The Spire is a Piece of excel∣lent Wor manship, but it received such
<PB REF="84" MS="y"/>
a shock some Years ago, that it was next to miraculous, that the whole Stee∣ple did not fall down; which in short, if it had, would almost have demolish'd the whole Church.</P>
<P>It was a Fire-Ball, if we take it from the Inhabitants, or, to speak in the Lan∣guage of Nature, the Lightning broke upon the Steeple, and such was the ir∣resistible force of it, that it drove several great Stones out of the Steeple, and car∣ry'd them clear off, not from the Roof of the Church only, but of the adjacent Houses also, and they were found at a prodigious distance from the Steeple, so that they must have been shot out of the places where they stood in the Stee∣ple, as if they had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ot out of a Can∣non, or blown out of a Mine: One of these Stones of at least a Ton weight▪ by Estimation, was blown over the South side, or row of Houses in the West street, and fell on the Ground in the Street at a Gentleman's Door, on the other side of the way; and another of them almost as big was blown over both sides of the said West street, into the same Gentle∣man's Garden, at whose Door the other Stone lay, and no hurt was done by either of them; whereas if either of those Stones had fallen upon the strongest built House in the Street, it would have dash'd it all to pieces, even to the Foun∣dation: This account of the two Stones, I relate from a Person of undoubted Cre∣dit, who was an Eye-Witness, and saw them, but had not the Curiosity to measure them, which he was very sorry for. The breach it made in the Spire, tho' within about Forty Five Foot of the top, was so large, that as the Work∣men said to me, a Coach and Six Horses might have driven through it, and yet the Steeple stood fast, and is now very substantially repair'd; withal, showing that it was before, an admirable sound and well finished piece of Workman∣ship.</P>
<P>They have a Story in this City, that whenever a Bishop of that Diocese is to Dye, a Heron comes and sits upon the Pinnacle of the Spire of the Cathedral; This accordingly happen d, about—when Dr.—Williams was Bishop; A Butcher standing at his Shop-Door, in the South-street, saw it, and ran in for for his Gun, and being a good Marks. Man shot the Heron, and kill'd it, at which his Mother was very angry with him, and said, he had kill'd the Bishop, and the next Day News came to the Town that Dr. Williams, the last Bishop was dead; this is affirm'd by many Peo∣ple Inhabi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants of the Place.</P>
<P>This City is not a Place of much Trade, nor is it very Populous; but they are lately fal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en into a very particular way of managing the Corn Trade here which it is said turns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery well to account, the Country round it is very Fruitful, and par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ularly in good Wneat, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> generally sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking carry'd all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y nea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forty Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>iage, and from some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Country more than forty Miles.</P>
<P>But some Money'd Men of Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hester, Emswo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> h, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Places ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cent, have join'd their S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ocks together built large Granaries near the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook, where the Vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s come up▪ and here they buy and lay up all the Corn which the Coun∣try on that side can spare; and having good Mills in the Neighbourhood, they grind and dress the Corn, and send it to London in the Meal about by Long Sea, as they call it; nor now the War is over do they make the Voyage so tedious as to do the Meal any hurt, as at first in the time of War was sometimes the Case for want of Convoys.</P>
<P>It is true, this is a great lessening to Farnham Market, but that is of no con∣sideration in the Case; for, if the Mar∣ket at London is supply'd, the coming by Sea from Chichester is every jot as much a publick good, as the encouraging of Farnham Market, which is of itself the greatest Corn Market in England, Lon∣don excepted. Notwithstanding all the decrease from this side of the Country, this carrying of Meal by
<PB REF="85"/>
Sea met with so just an Encouragement from hence, that it is now practised from several other Places on this Coast, even as far as Hampton.</P>
<P>From Chichester, the Road lying still West, passes in View of the Earl of Scar∣borough's fine Seat at Stansted, a House seeming to be a retreat, being surround∣ed with thi k Woods, through which there are the most pleasant agreeable Vi∣sto's cut that are to be seen any where in England, particularly, because through the West opening, which is from the Front of the House they si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Din¦ing Room of the House, and see the Town and Harbour of Portsmouth, the Ships Spithead, and also at St. Helens; which, when the Royal Navy happens to be there, as often happened during the late War, is a most glorious Sight.</P>
<P>This House was fatal to Dr. Williams, mentioned above, Bishop of Chichester, who having been here to make a Visit to the late Earl of Scarborough, was thrown out of his Coach, or rather threw himself out, being frighted by the unru∣liness of his Horses, and broke his Leg in the Fall, which, his Lordship being in Years, was Mortal to him: He dy'd in a few days after.</P>
<P>From hence we descend gradually to Portsmouth, the largest Fortification, be∣yond comparison, that we have in Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and but it was not with any Considera∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion, that the Author before recited could say, it was the only regular Fortification in England; especially the same Writer owning afterwards that Shireness, Lan∣guardfort, and Tilbury, were all regu∣lar Fortifications, as they really are.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Place is such, hat it is chosen, as may well be said, or the best Security to the Navy above ll the Places in Britain; the Entrance nto the Harbour is safe, but very nar∣ow, guarded on both Sides by terrible latforms Cannon, particularly on the oint; which is a Suburb of Portsmouth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>operly so called, where there is a Brick latform built with two Tire of Guns, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e over another, and which can Fire in Cover, that the Gunners cannot be beaten from their Guns, or their Guns easily dismounted; the other is from the Point of Land on the side of Gosport, which they call Gilkicker, where also they have two Batteries.</P>
<P>Before any Ships attempt to enter this Port by Sea, they must also pass the Cannon of the main Platform of the Garrison, and also another at South-Sea-Castle, so that it is next to impossible that any Ships could match the Force of all those Cannon, and be able to force their way into the Harbour; in which I speak the Judgment of Men well ac∣quainted with such Matters, as well as my own Opinion, and of Men whose Opinion leads them to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the best of the Force of Naval Batteries too; and who have talk'd of making no Difficulty to Force their way through the Thames in the Teeth of the Line of Guns at Tilbury; I say, they have talk'd of it, but it was but talk, as any one of Judg∣ment would imagin, that knew the Works at Tilbury, of which I have spo∣ken in its Place: The reason however, which they give for the Difference, have some Force in them, as they relate to Portsmouth, though not as they relate to Tilbury; viz. That the Mouth, or Entrance into Portsmouth is narrow, and may be locked up with Boombs, which before the Ships could break, and while they were lying at them to break them away, they would be torn in Pieces by the Battery at the Point: (next) That the Guns on the said Battery at the Point at Portsmouth, are defended as above with Ambruziers, and the Gun∣ners stand cover'd, so that they cannot so soon be beaten from their Guns, or their Guns so soon dismounted by the warm Quarter of a three Deck Ship, as at Tilbury, where all the Gunners and Guns too must stand open, both to small and great Shot: Besides, at Tilbury, while some of the Ships lay Battering the Fort, others would pass behind them, close under the Town, and if one or more received Damage from the Fort, the rest would pass in the Cloud of Smoke, and perhaps might compass their
<PB REF="86" MS="y"/>
Design, as is the Case in all Places, where the Entrance is broad: whereas at Portsmouth, they would be battered within little more than Pistol shot, and from both sides of the Way, whereas at Tilbury there are very few Guns on the Gravesend side of the River</P>
<P>But to avoid comparing of Strengths, or saying what may be done in one Place, and not done in another; 'tis e∣vident, in the Opinion of all that I have met with, that the greatest Fleet of Ships that ever were in the Hands of one Nation at a Time, would not pre∣tend, if they had not an Army also on Shoar, to attack the whole Work, to force their Entrance into the Harbour of Portsmouth.</P>
<P>As to the Strength of the Town by Land, the Works are very large and numerous, and besides the Battery at the Point aforesaid, there is a large Horn∣work on the South-side, running out towards South Sea Castle; there is al o a good Counterscarp, and double Mote, with Ravelins in the Ditch, and double Pallisadoes, and advanc'd Works to co∣ver the Place from any approach, where it may be practicable. The Strength of the Town is also considerably augment∣ed on the Land side, by the Fortifica∣tions raised in King William's Time, about the Docks and Yards, which are now perfected, and those Parts made a particular Strength by themselves; and though they are indeed, in some Sense, independent one of another, so at that they cannot be separately atracked on that side, while they are both in the same Hands.</P>
<P>These Docks and Yards are now like a Town by themselves, and are a kind of Marine Corporation, or a Govern∣ment of their own kind within them∣selves; there being particular large rows of dwellings, built at the publick Charge, within the New Works, for all the prin∣cipal Officers of the Place; especially the Commissioner, the Agent of the Victu∣alling, and such as these; the Trades∣men likewise have Houses here, and many of the Labourers are allowed to live in the bounds as they can get Lodg∣ing.</P>
<P>The Town of Portsmouth, besides its being a Fortification, is a well inhabited thriving, prosperous Corporation; and hath been greatly enrich'd of late by the Fleet's having so often and so long lain there, as well as large Flee s of Merchant Men, as the whole Navy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the late War; besides the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fitting out of Men here, and he of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paying them at Portsmouth, h s m d a great Confluence of People t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er on their private Business, with other things, which the Attendance on those Fleets hath required: These things have not only been a great Advantage to the Town, but has really made the whole Place Rich▪ and the Inhabitants of Ports∣mouth are quite another fort of People than they were a few Years before the Revolution; this is what Mr. Camden takes notice of, even so long ago as the Reign of Queen Elizabeth▪ that Ports∣mouth was Populous in time of War; but not so in time of Peace. But now the Business of the Navy is so much en∣creased, and so much of it always done here, that it may be said, there is as much to do at Portsmouth now in time of Peace, as there was then in time of War, and more too.</P>
<P>There is also this Note to be put upon the two great Arsenals of England, Ports∣mouth, and Chatham; namely, That they thrive by a War, as the War respects their Situation, viz. That wh n a War with France happens, or with Spain, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Portsmouth grows Rich, and when a War with Holland, or any of the Powers of the North, then Ch tham, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ool∣wich, and Deptfort, are in request; but of this I shall speak again, when I came to speak of the like Antithesis between Plymouth and the Humber, or Portsmouth and the Firth of Ed nburgh.</P>
<P>The Government of the Place is by a Mayor and Aldermen, &amp;c. as in other Corporations, and the Civil Government is no more interrup ed by the Military, th n if there was no Garrison there, such is the good Conduct of the Governors, and
<PB REF="87"/>
such it has always been since our Sove∣reigns have ceas'd to encourage the Sol∣diery to insult the Civil Magistrates: And we have very seldom had any Com∣plaint on either side, either of want of Discipline among the Soldiers, or want of Prudence in the Magistrates. The In∣habitants indeed necessarily submit to such Things as are the Consequence of a Garrison Town, such as being examin'd at the Gates, such as being obliged to keep Garrison Hours, and not be let out, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> let in after Nine a Clock at Night, and the like; but these are Things no People will count a Burthen, where they get their Bread by the very Situation of the Place, as is the case here</P>
<P>Since the encrease of Business at this Place by the long continuance of the War, the Confluence of People has been so great, and the Town not admitting any enlargement for Buildings, that a kind of a Suburb, or rather a new Town has been built on the healthy Ground adjoining to the Town, which is so well built, and seems to encrease so fast, that in time it threatens to outdo for Num∣bers of inhabitants, and beauty of Build∣ings, even the Town itself; and parti∣cularly by being unconfined by the Laws of the Garrison, as above, and unencum∣bered with the Corporation Burthens, Freedoms, Town Duties, Services, and the like.</P>
<P>From Portsmouth West, the Country lies low and slat, and is full of Creeks and Inlets of the Sea and Rivers, all the way to Southampton, so that we Ferry over three times in about eighteen Miles; besides going over one Bridge, namely, at Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hfield, The first of these Ferries is that at Portsmouth itself, viz. cross the Mouth of the Harbour, from the Point above-mention'd, to Gosport; from then<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e we ride to I'ichfield, as above, where we pass the River Alre, which rises in the same Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y at Al∣resfo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nea it, which is not above twenty-two Miles off; and yet it is a large River here, and makes a good Road below, call Tichfield Bay: Thence at about Four Miles we pass another Ri∣ver at Bussel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, narrow in Breadth but exceeding Deep and eminent for its being able to carry the biggest Ships: Here is a Building-Yard for Ships of War, and in King William's Time two Eighty Gun Ships were Launch'd here I seems the Safety of the Creek, and the Plenty of Timber in the Country behind it, is the reason of Building so much in this Place.</P>
<P>From hence when we come opposite to Southampton, we pass another Creek, being the Mouth of the River—which comes down from Winchester, and is both very broad and deep, and the Ferrymen having a very sorry Boat, we found it dangerous enough passing it: On the other Bank stands the an∣cient Town of Southampton and on the other side of Southampton comes done another large River, entring South∣ampton Water by Red-Bridge; so that the Town of Southampton stands up∣on a Point running out into the Sea, between two very fine Rivers, both Navigable, up some length into the Country, and particularly useful for the bringidg down Timber out of one of the best Wooded Counties in Britain; for the River on the West side of the Town in particular comes by the edge of the great Forest, call'd New Forest; here we saw a prodigious quantity of Timber, of an uncommon size, vastly large, ly∣ing on the Shoar of the River, for above two Miles in length, which they told us was brought thither from the Forest, and left there to be fetch'd by the Builders at Portsmouth Dock, as they had occasion for it.</P>
<P>In riding over the South Part of Hamp∣shire, I made this observation about that growth of Timber, which I mention in Supplement to what I said before concern∣ing our Timber being wasted and decay'd in England, viz that notwithstanding the very great Consumption of Timber in K. William's Reign, by building or rebuilding almost the whole Navy; and norwithsland∣ing so many of the King's Ships were built hereabouts, besides abundance of
<PB REF="88" MS="y"/>
large Merchant Ships, which were about that time built at Southampton, at Red∣bridge, and at Bursleton, &amp;c. yet I saw the Gentlemens Estates, within six, eight, or ten Miles of Southampton, so over∣grown with Wood, and their Woods so full of large full grown Timber, that it seem'd as if they wanted Sale for it, and that it was of little worth to them. In one Estate at Hursely in particular near Winchester, the Estate since bought by Mr. Cardonell, late Manager for the Duke of Marlborough, and formerly be longing to Mr. Cromwell, Grandson to Oliver Cromwell, the whole Estate not above 800 l. per Ann in Rent, they might have cut Twenty Thousand Pounds worth of Timber down, and yet have left the Woods in a thriving Condition; in an∣other Estate between that and Petersfield, of about 1000 l. per Ann. they told me they could Fella Thousand Pounds a Year in good large Timber fit for Building, for twenty Years together, and do the Woods no harm: Colonel Norton also, a known Gentleman, whose Seat at Southwick, is within six Miles of Portsmouth, and within three Miles of the Water Carriage; this Gentleman they told me had an immense quantity of Timber, some grow∣ing within sight of the very Docks in Portsmouth: Farther West it is the like, aud as I rode through New Forest, I cou'd see the ancient Oaks of many hun∣dred Years standing, perishing with their wither'd Tops advanc'd up in the Air, and grown White with Age, and that could never yet get the favour to be cut dow, and made serviceable to their Country.</P>
<P>These in my Opinion are no signs of the decay of our Woods, or of the dan∣ger of our wanting Timber in England; on the contrary, I take leave to mention it again, that if we were employ'd in England, by the rest of the World, to build a Thousand Sail of Three Deck Ships, from 80 to 100 Guns, it might be done to our infinite Advantage, and without putting us in any danger of ex∣hausting the Nation of Timber.</P>
<P>I shall give other hints of the like, when I come to speak of Hertfordshire Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, and the Counties which we call Inland, where the Timber is really of small Value, for want of Water Carriage to carry it away likewise again in the Counties North ward, bordering upon the Humber, and upon all the Northern Rivers, not to say a Word of Ireland; which is still a Store∣house of Timber, more inexhaustible if possible than England.</P>
<P>Southampton is a truly ancient Town, for 'tis in a manner dying with Age; the decay of the Trade is the real decay of the Town; and all the Business of Mo∣ment that is transacted there, is the Trade between us and the Islands of Jersey and Guernsey, with a little of the Wine Trade, and much Smuggling: The build∣ing of Ships also is much stop'd of late; however, the Town is, large, has many People in it, a noble fair High-street, a spacious Key; and if it's Trade should revive, is able to entertain great num∣bers of People: There is a French Church and no inconsiderable Congregation, which was a help to the Town and there are still some Merchants who Trade to Newfoundland, and to the Streights with Fish; but for all other Trade, it may be said of as of other Towns, Lon∣don has eaten it up. The Situation of the Town between two Rivers was to its advantage formerly in point of Strength, and the Town was Wall'd with a very strong Wall, strengthen'd with a Ram∣part, and a double Ditch; but I do not hear that they ever were put to make much use of them.</P>
<P>Whatever the Fable of Bevis of South∣ampton, and the Gyants in the Woods thereabouts may deriv'd from, I found the People mighty willing to have those Things pass for true; and at the North Gate of the Town, the only Entrance from the Land side, they have the Figures of two eminent Champions, who might pass for Gyants if they were alive now, but they can tell us very little of their Hisstory, but what is all Fabulous like the rest, so I say no more of them</P>

I was now at the extent of my intend∣ed Journey West, and thought of looking no farther this way for the present, so I came away North East, leaving Win∣chester a little on the Left, and came into the Portsmouth Road at Petersfield, a Town Eminent for little, but its being full of good Inns, and standing in the middle of a Country, still over-grown with a prodigious quantity of Oak-Tim∣ber. From hence we came to Alton, and in the Road thither, began a little to taste the Pleasure of the Western Downs, which reach from Winchester almost to Alton.</P>
<P>The Duke of Bolton has two very No∣ble Seats in this Country▪ one be ween Alton and Alresford, and one at Basing, of which hereafter. Alton is a small Market-Town, of no Nore, neither is there any considerable Manufacture in all this part of England, except a little Drugget and Shalloon making, whi h begins hereabouts, otherwise the w ose Counties of Kent, Sussex, Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey, and Hampshire, are not employ'd in any con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>derable Woollen Manufacture; what here is, I have spoken of a our Cran∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rook in Kent, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilford, and Farnham Surrey, and a little in the North Part <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barkshire, all which put together, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not equal to one ordinary Manufactu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Village in Essex or Norfolk.</P>
<P>From Alton we came to Farnham of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich I can only say, that it is a large <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pulous Market-Town, the arthest that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay in the County of Surrey, and with∣ut exception the greatest Corn-Market England, London excepted; that is say, particularly for Wheat, of which vast a quan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iry is brought every Mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t-Day to this Market, that Gentle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n told me, he once counted on a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arket-Day Eleven Hundred Teams of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse, all drawing Waggons, or Carts, den with Wheat at this Market; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery Team of which is supposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng what they call a Load, that is to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Forty Bushel of Wheat to Market, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich is in the whole, Four and Forty ousand Bushel; but I do not take up∣on me to affirm this Relation, to say whether it be a probable Opinion or not; I know some have thought the quantity has been much more; but this also was, I suppose, before the People of Chiches∣ter and Emsworth on one side, and South∣ampton Tichfield, and Redbridge on the other, took to the Trade of sending their Wheat in Meal to London by Sea, as is mentioned above.</P>
<P>At this Town is a Castle Eminent for this, that it was built by a Bishop of Winchester; and tho' its Antiquity is evident, as far back as King Stephen; yet it remains to the Bishops of Winches∣ter to this Day. Here the said Bishops of Winchester usually keep their ordina∣ry Residence, and tho' the County of Surrey, be generally speaking within the Diocess, they may be truly said to Reside in the middle of their Ecclesiastical Do∣minion. The Farnham People it seems, or some of the Country Folks, notwith∣standing the Liberality and Bounty of the several Bishops, who, if some People may be believ'd, have been very good Benefactors to the Town; I say, not∣withstanding all this, have of late been very unkind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Bishop, in pulling down the Pale of his Park, and plunder∣ing it of the Deer, Killing, Wounding, and Disabling, even those they cou'd not carry away.</P>
<P>From Farnham, that I might take in the whole County of Surrey, I took the Coach-Road, over Bagshot-Heath, and that great Forest, as 'tis call'd of Wind∣sor; Those that despise Scotland, and the North Part of England, for being full of Wast and Barren Land, may take a view of this part of Surrey, and look upon it as a Foil to the Beauty of the the rest of England; or a Mark of the just resentment shew'd by Heaven upon the Englishmen's Pride; I mean the-Pride theyshew in boasting of their Coun∣try, its Fruitfulness, Pleasantness, Rich∣ness, the Fertility of the Soil, &amp;c. where as here is a vast Tract of Land, some of it within seventeen or eighteen Miles of the Capital City; which is not only
<PB REF="90" MS="y"/>
Poor, but even quite steril, given up to Barrenness, horrid and frightful to look on, not only good for little, but good for nothing; much of it is a Sandy De∣sert, and one may frequently be put in Mind here of Arabia Deserta, where the Winds raise the Sands, so as to over∣whelm whole Caravans of Travellers, Cattle and People together; for in pas∣sing this Heath, in a Windy Day, I was so far in danger of fmothering with the Clouds of Sand, which were raised by the Storm, that I cou'd neither keep it out of my Mouth, Nose or Eyes; and when the Wind was over, the Sand ap∣pear'd spread over the adjacent Fields of the Forest some Miles distant, so as that it ruins the very Soil. This Sand indeed is check'd by the Heath, or Hea∣ther, which grows in it, and which is the common product of Barren Land, even in the very Highlands of Scotland; but the Ground is otherwise so Poor and Barren, that the Product of it seeds no Creatures, but some very small Sheep, who seed chiefly on the said Heather, and but very few of these, nor are there any Villages, worth mentioning, and but few Houses, or People for many Miles far and wide; this Desart lyes extended so much, that some say, there is not less than a Hundred Thousand Acres of this Barren Land that lyes all together, reaching out every way in the Three Counties of Surrey, Hampshire and Berk∣shire; besides a great quantity of Land, almost as bad as that between Godal∣ming and Petersfield, on the Road to Ports∣mouth, including some Hills, call'd the Hind Head and others.</P>
<P>Thro' this Desart, for I can call it no less, we come into the great Westerm Road, leading from London to Salisbu∣ry, Exeter, &amp;c. and pass the Thames at Stanes; and here I could not but call to mind' upon viewing the Beautiful Pros∣pect of the River, and of the Meadows, on the Banks of the River, on the Left Hand of the Road, I say, I cou'd not but call to mind those two Excellent Lines of Sir John Denhan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in his Poem, call'd Cooper's-Hill, Viz.</P>

<P>Here I remember'd that I had yet left the Inland Towns o the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o Kent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Sussex, and almost all the County of Surrey out of my Account, and that having as it were taken a cir∣cuit round the Coast only; I had a great many Places worth Viewing to g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve an Account of; I therefore left <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which was within my View on out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other, as bring the Subject of another Part; and resolv d t fin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat View, in the Order I had b gun i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ That is to say, to give an Ac ount of the whole Country as I come on; that I may make no in ongruous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from one remote Park of Edgland to ano∣ther, at least as few as may be.</P>
<P>From Stanes therefore I turn'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> S.

<P>From hence we came to Guilford, a well known and considerable Market-Town: It has the Name of being the County Town, tho' it cannot properly be call'd so; neither the County Goal being here, or the Assizes, any more than in common with other Towns: But the Election indeed for Parliament Men for the County is always held here. The River which according to Mr. Cam∣den is call'd the Wey, and which falls into the Thames at Oatlands, is made Navigable to this Town, which adds greatly to its Trade; and by this Na∣vigation a very great quantity of Timber is brought down to London, not from the Neighbourhood of this Town only, but even from the Woody parts of Sus∣fex and Hampshire above Thirty Miles from it, the Country Carriages bringing it hither in the Summer by Land. This Navigation is also a mighty support to the great Corn Market at Farnham, which I have mentioned so often: For as the Meal-Men and other Dealers buy the Corn at that Market, much of it is brought to the Mills on this River; which is not above Seven Miles distant, and be∣ing first Ground and Dress'd, is then sent down in the Meal by Barges to Lon∣don; the Expence of which is very small▪, as is practised on the other side of the Thames, for above Fifty Miles distance from London.</P>
<P>Here, as I observ'd in its Place, is a small remainder of an Old Manufacture, that is to say, of the Clothing Trade, and it extends it self to Godalming, Haselmeer, and the Vale Country, on the side of the Holmwood; a Place of which I shall speak on another Occasion quite to Darking: These Cloths of a middling Price, have formerly been in great Repute, and then again were al∣most quite decay'd, but by the Applica∣tion and Skill of the Clothiers, main∣tain'd the Credit of their Make, and are encourag d, and indeed revived in Re∣putation of late Years, when the Clothi∣ers of Cranbrook and Tenterden in Kent, whose Goods are of the same kind, are almost sunk to nothing, as I have alrea∣dy observed</P>
<P>This Clothing Trade, however small, is very assistant to the Poor of this Part of the Country, where the Lands, as I have noted, are but indifferent; except just above the great Towns, and where abundance of the Inhabitants are, what we call Cottagers, and live chiefly by the Benefit of the large Commons and Heath Ground, of which the quantity is so very great</P>
<P>From this Town of Guilford, the Road to Farnham is very remarkable, for it runs along West from Guilford, upon the ridge of a high Chalky Hill, so narrow that the breadth of the Road takes up the breadth of the Hill▪ and the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣vity begins on either Hand, at the very Hedge that bounds the Highway, and is very steep, as well as very high; from this Hill is a Prospect either way, so far that 'tis surprising; and one sees to the North, or N. W. over the great Black Desart, call'd Bagshot▪Heath, mention∣ed above, one way, and the other way South East into Sussex, almost to the South Downs, and West to an unbound∣ed length, the Horizon only restraining the Eyes: This Hill being all Chalk, a Traveller feels the effect of it in a Hot Summer's Day, being scorch'd by the Reflection of the Sun from the Chalk, so as to make the Heat almost insupport∣able, and this I speak by my own Ex∣perience: This Hill reaches from Guil∣ford Town's End to within a Mile and half of Farnham.</P>
<P>The Hill, or the going up to it from Guilford rather, is call'd St. Katharine's-Hill, and at the Top of the Ascent from the Town stands the Gallows, which is so placed, respecting the Town, that the

The Right Reverend and Learned Editor of the Additions to Mr. Camden, makes it yet worse, speaking of Beechworth Castle, which is a Mile before we come to Darking; and 'tis at the Foot of this Castle here, says his Lordship, that the River Mole being nigh to the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Box Hill is swallow'd up.</Q></P>
<P>Now 'tis something strange for me to take upon me, after two such Authori∣ties, to say, that neither of these is righ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The Accounts are so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that ma∣ny curious People have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e this Place, called Swallow, and to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e this Beechworth Castle▪ at the Foot of which the River is swallowed up, not doubting but they should see some won∣derful Gulph, in which a whole Ri∣ver should be at once, as it were b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ried alive; for Mr. Camden <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Swal∣low is the Place: The Bishop <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Beechworth-Castle the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣ed up; nay▪ and to make the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der appear more conformable to the Rela∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, the Map of the County of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rey, placed in Mr. Camden, makes a large Blank between the River at Swallowed up, a little off of Darking, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again as at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, breaking the River off abruptly, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s if pouring its Wa∣ters all at once into a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Common-Shores of the Streets of London, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it out a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in at once, just as the Water of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> running into Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> out from under <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Now after all these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ries, the matter of Fact is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and no more, and even of this, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> wonder∣ful enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo: But I say i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is this, and no more, viz.</P>
<P>The River Mole p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses by Beechworth-Castle in a full Stream; and for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar a Mile farther on the West of the Castle, it takes into its Stream Da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook, as they call i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and has upon it a large Corn-Mill, called Da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king-Mill; below this it runs close at the Foot of Box-Hill, near that part of the Hill, which is call∣ed the Stomacher; then, as if obstruct∣ed by the Hill, it turns a little South,
<PB REF="94" MS="y"/>
and runs cross the Road which leads from Darking to Leatherhead, where it is ap∣parently rapid and strong; and then fetches a Circuit round a Park, formerly belonging to Sir Richard Studdolph, and which is part of it, within sight of Lea∣therhead, and so keeps a continued Cha∣nel to the very Town of Leatherhead; so that there is no such thing as a na∣tural Bridge, or a River lost, no, not at all; and in the Winter, in time of Floods the Stream will be very large, and rapid all the way above Ground, which I af∣firm of my own Knowledge, having seen it so, on many Occasions.</P>
<P>But the true State of the Case is this, the Current of the River being much obstructed by the Interposition of those Hills, called Box-Hill, which though de∣scending in a kind of Vale, as if parted to admit the River to pass, and making that Descent so low as to have the ap∣pearance of a Level, near a Village call∣ed Mickleham; I say, these Hills yet in∣terrupting the free Course of the River, it forces the Waters as it were to find their Way through as well as they can; and in order to this, beginning, I say, where the River comes close to the Foot of the Precipice of Box-Hill, called the Stomacher, the Waters sink insensibly away, and in some Places are to be seen (and I have seen them) little Chanels which go out of the sides of the River, where the Water in a Stream not so big as would fill a Pipe of a quarter of an Inch Diameter, trills away out of the River, and sinks insensibly into the Ground.</P>
<P>In this manner it goes away, lessening the Stream for above a Mile, near two, and these they call the Swallows; and the whole Ground on the Bank of the River, where it is flat and low, is full of these subterraneous Passages; so that if on any suden rain the River swells over Banks, it is observ'd not to go back into the Chanel again when the Flood abates, but to sink away into the Earth in the Meadows, where it spreads; a remark∣able Proof of which I shall give pre∣sently.</P>
<P>But now take this with you as you go, that these Swallows, for they are many, and not one call'd the Swallow, as is said in Mr. Camden; these Swal∣lows (I say) tho' they diminish the Stream much, do not so drink it up as to make it disappear. But that, where it crosses the Road near Mickleham, it runs, as I have said, very sharp and broad, nor did I ever know it dry in the dryest Summer in that Place, tho' I liv'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Neighbourhood several Years: On the contrary I have known it so deep, that Waggons and Carriages have not dar'd to go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hro'▪ but never knew it, I say, dry in the greatest time of Drought.</P>
<P>Below this Place the Hills rise again on the other side very high, and parti∣cularly on the Ridge, which the Coun∣try People call the Ashcom-Hills, and they seem to force the River again West; so it surrounds most of the Park I menti∣oned above, and has several Bridges up∣on it, and by this time indeed, so much of it is sun away▪ that in a very dry Summer the Chanel, tho' full of Water in Pits and Holes cannot be perceiv'd to run, but this must be, I say, in a very dry Season, and still there is the Chanel visible where it runs at other times fiercely enough.</P>
<P>This part which I say has the least Water, continuing about half a Mile, we then perceive the Chanel insensibly to have more Water than before: That is to say, that as it sunk in gradually and insensibly, so it takes vent again in the like manner in Thousands of little Springs and unseen Places, very few in any quan¦tity, till in another half Mile, it is a ful River again, and passes in full Stream under Leatherhead Bridge, above, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the truth of this, I apeal to the Know¦ledge of the Inhabitants of Darking Mickleham, Leatherhead, and all th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country round.</P>
<P>A farther Proof of this, and which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Account which I promised abov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relating to the gradual sinking away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Water, take as follows: It was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="95" MS="y"/>
the Year 1676, in the Month of Octo∣ber, or thereabouts, that there happen d a very sudden hasty Land Flood, which swelled the River to a very great height; and particularly so high, that at Beech∣worth-Castle, and other Gentlemen's Seats near the River, where they had Fish-Ponds that were fed by the River, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> overflowed their Ponds, and carry'd o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f all their Fish, or at least they thought for Sir Adam Brown lived then at Beech∣worth-Castle, a Gentleman in those days well known in the Country, for he was many Years Knight of the Shire, of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly of Brown, a Branch of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Montacute's at Midhurst, mentioned before, but a Collateral Line; another of the Brown's lived at Bueknal, another at Darking, shhich I mention chiefly, because some ignorant Wri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers particu∣larly the late Atlas, has confounded the Title of Montacute with the Sirname of Montague, which is quite another Fa∣mily and Generation, not at all ally'd, and nothing near so Ancient; but this by the by.</P>
<P>Sir Adam Brown's Son, and the young Gentlemen of these and other neigbour∣ing Families, disturbed at the loss of their Fish and moved by the Report, came all down to Darking, where they raised a little Troop of the young Fellows and Boys of the Town, and all went toge∣ther, to that part of the River which runs by the Foot of the Stomacher, as I said they call it, Box-Hill.</P>
<P>There was a low flat piece of Mea∣dow Ground, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing close to the River on one side▪ just opposi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to which, the Hill lying also close to the River, made up the Bank on the other: This piece of Ground might contain about four or five Acres, and lying hollow in the middle, like the shape of a Dripping-Pan, was, by the overflowing of the River, full of Water, and so full, that the Bank, which lay close to the River, though higher than the rest, was not to be seen.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen set themsel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and all their little Army at work, to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise this Bank which. I say, lay between the Ri¦ver and the hollow of the Field, so as to separate the Water in the hollow part of the Field from that in the River, and having so many Hands, they effected that Part the first Day, and made a so∣lid Dam, or Bank, so that they could walk upon it dry sooted; then they made a return to it, at the upper or East End of the Field; so that in short, no more Water could run into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Field from any part of the River.</P>
<P>When this was done, they built Huts, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Boots, and made Fires, and sent for Victuals and Drink to treat their young Company, and there they encamped as if they waited some great Event; and so indeed the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did, for in about two Nights and a Day, exclusive of the time they took in making their Dams, the Water sunk all away in the Field; and the Con∣sequence of that was, that the Fish be∣ing surrounded, were catched, as it were in a Trap, for they could not be swal∣sowed up with the Water; and the Pur∣chase fully recompenced their Labour, for the like Quantity of Fish; great and small, I believe, was never taken at once in this Kingdom, out of so small a Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>This Story would have nothing in it wondersul, or to make it worth accor∣ding, were it not so evident a Demon∣stration of the manner of this River losing itself under Ground, or being swallowed up, as they call it; for this Field where the Water funk away is just at the Place, which Mr. Cambden calls the Swallows, n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar the Village of Mics<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leham; and under the Precipiece of the Hill, and yet the Water was two Nights and a Day, as I say, sinking lei∣surely off; and in this manner, and in no other, does the whole River, or so much of it as passes under Ground, sink away.</P>
<P>The Town of Darking is eminent for severol little Things worth Observa∣tion; as first, for the great Roman High∣way, call'd S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onny street, which Mr. Camden says, passes through the very Church-Yard of his Town. Secondly
<PB REF="96" MS="y"/>
for a little Common or Heath, call'd the Cottman Dean, or the Dean or Heath of Poor Cottagers, for so the Word sig∣nifies, belonging to the Town; and where their Alms-House stands; which some learned Physicians have singled out for the best Air in England: Thirdly, for Mr. Howard's House and Garden, call d Deaden, the Garden is so naturally mounded with Hills, that it makes a com∣pleat Amphitheatre, being an Oblong Square, the Area about Eighty Yards by Forty, and the Hills unpassable steep, serve instead of Walls, and are hand∣somely planted with Trees, whose Tops rising above one another gradually, as the Hill rises at their Roots, make a most beautiful Green Wall, of perhaps Fifty or Sixty Foot high; at the North End, which is the Entrance, is the House, which closes it wholly, and at the South End, the ancient Possesser, Mr. Howard, by what we call Perforation, caused a Vault or Cave to be made quite through the Hill, which came out again into a fine Vineyard, which he planted the same Year, on the South side, or slope of the Hill, and which they say has produced since most excellent good Wines, and a very great quantity of them.</P>
<P>Mr. Howard was an Honourable and Ancient Gentleman, younger Brother to the Duke of Norfolk, then living; viz. In the Year 1676, for in that Year, or the Year before, was that Vineyard plant∣ed, and tho' Mr. Howard was then upwards of Sixty Years of Age, he en∣joy'd that pleasant Seat near Thirty Years after.</P>
<P>At this Town liv'd another ancient Gentleman and his Son, of a very good Family; viz. Augustin Bellson, Esq; or as some write it Belschon, the Father was measur'd seven Foot and half an Inch high, allowing all that he might have sunk, for his Age, being Seventy One Years old; and the Son measur'd Two Inches Taller than his Father.</P>
<P>These Families were Roman, as were several others thereabouts at that time; but were soon after, upon the breaking out of the Popish Plot, dispers'd▪ some one way, and some another, as the Fate of those Times oblig'd them to do: tho' I do not remember that any part of the Scenes of Treason were lay'd about Darking, or that any of the Romish Gen∣tlemen thereabout were charg'd with be∣ing concern'd with them.</P>
<P>The Market of Darking cannot be o∣mitted, as it relates to my design of giving an Account of the several Parts of England; from whence this great City of London, and all the Dai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty Dishes, which are to be seen there, as to Eating, is supply'd with Provisions.</P>
<P>This Market is of all the Markets in England famous for Poultry; and par∣ticularly for the fastest Geese, and the largest Capons, the Name of a Darking Capon being well known among the Poulterers in Leadenhall Market▪ in a Word, they are brought to this Market from as far as Horsham in Sussex; and 'tis the Business of all the Country, on that side for many Miles, to breed and fatten up, insomuch, that 'tis like a Ma∣nufacture to the Country People; and some of these Capons are so large, as that they are little inferior to Turkeys: and I have seen them sold for 4 s. to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s. 6d. each and weighing from 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to 5 or 6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. a piece.</P>
<P>Once a Year here is also a Fair, viz. on Holy Thursday, chiefly for Lambs, and the greatest F ir in England of that kind: I have pass'd over the so much celebrated House of Mr. Fvelyn at Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ton near Darking▪ not that it is not wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Notice, but because so many other Wri∣ters have said so much of it.</P>
<P>On the Top of Box-Hill, and in view of this Town, grows a very great Beech-Tree, which by way of distinction is call'd The great Beech, and a very great Tree it is; but I mention it on the following account, under the Shade of this Tree, was a little Vaul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and here every Sunday, during the Summer Season, there used to be a Ren∣dezvous of Coaches and Horsemen with abundance of Gentlemen and Ladies from Epsom to take the Air, and in the Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Woods; and in a word, Divert, or De∣bauch,
<PB REF="97" MS="y"/>
or perhaps both, as they thought fit, and the Game encreased so much, that it began almost on a sudden to make a great Noise in the Country.</P>
<P>A Vintner who kept the King's-Arms-Inn, at Darking▪ taking Notice of the constant and unusual Flux of Company thither, took the Hint from the Prospect of his Advantage, which offered, and obtaining leave of Sir Adam Brown, whose Mannor and Land it was f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nish'd this little Cellar or Vault with Tables, Chairs, &amp;c. and with Wine and Eatables to entertain the Ladies and Gentlemen on Sundays Nights, as above; and this was so agreeable to them as that it encreased the Company exceed∣ingly; in a Word, by these means, the Concourse of Gentry, and in consequence of the Country People, became so great, that the Place was a little Fair; so that at length the Country began to take Notice of it, and it was very offensive, especially to the best governed People; this lasted some Years, I think Two or Three, and tho' Complaint was made of it to Sir Adam Brown, and the Neigh∣bouring Justices; alledging the Revell∣ing, and the indecent Mirth that was among them, and on the Sabbath Day too, yet it did not obtain a suitable Re¦dress; whereupon a certain set of young Men, of the Town of Darking, and perhaps prompted by some others, re∣senting the Thing also▪ made an unwel∣come Visit to the Place once on a Sa∣turday Night, just before the usual Time of their wicked Mirth, and behold when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Coaches and Ladies, &amp;c. from Ep∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om appear'd the next Afternoon, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the Cellar or Vault, and all that was in it, blown up with Gun-Powder; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd so secret was it kept, that upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tmost enquiry it cou'd never be heard, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r found out who were the Persons that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id it: That Action put an End to their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evels for a great while; nor was the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lace ever repair'd that I heard of, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast it was not put to the same wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that it was employ'd in before.</P>
<P>From this Hill, and particularly from his part of it, is a fair View in clear Weather quite over the Wild of Sussex, to the South Downs; and by the help of Glasses, those who know where Things are situated, may plainly see the Town of Horsham, Ashdown Forest, the Duke of Somerset's House at Petworth, and the South Downs, as they range be∣tween Brighthelmston and Arundel; be∣sides an unbounded Prospect into Kent.</P>
<P>The Vale beneath this Hill is for many Miles East and West, call'd the Holmwa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, by some the Holm-Wood, others Holmsdale▪ but more vulgarly the Homeward: In the Woody Part of which are often found outlying red Deer, and in the Davs of K. James I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. or while he was Duke of York, they have hunted the largest Stags here that have been seen in England; the Duke took great Care to have them preserv'd for his own Sport, and they were so preserv'd for many Years; but have since that been most of them destroy'd.</P>
<P>This Homeward, or Holmwood, is a Vale, which is now chiefly grown with Furz, famous for the Country People, gathering such quantities of Strawberries, as they car y them to Market by Horse-Loads: I saw neither Town or Village, for many Miles on it, much less any Gen∣tlemen's Seats, only Cottages and single Houses; but vast quantities of Geese and Poultry, which as said above employs all the Country in breeding them up: There has been large Timber here, (they say) but most of it is cut down and gone, except that where there are any Woods standing, the Timber is still exceeding good and large.</P>
<P>It is suggested that this Place was in ancient Times so unpassable a Wild, or overgrown Waste, the Woods so thick, and the extent so large, reaching far into Sussex, that it was the Retreat for many Ages of the Native Britons, who the Romans cou'd never drive out; and after that it was the like to the Saxons, when the Danes harrass'd the Nation with their Troops, and Ravag'd the Country wherever they came; and on this Account they retain here in Me∣mory the following Lines.</P>
<Q><PB REF="98" MS="y"/>
<L>This is Holmes Dale,</L>
<L>Never Conquer'd, never shall.</L></Q>
<P>But this a piece of History, which I leave as I find; the Country tho' wild still, and perhaps having the same Coun∣tenance now in many Places, as it had above a thousand Years ago; yet in o∣ther Places is cultivated, and has Roads passable enough in the Summer quite thro' it, on every side, and the Woods are cleared off in a great measure as above</P>
<P>Keeping at the Bottom of these Hills, and yet not entered into this Vale, the Country is dry, and rather sandy or gra∣vel, and is full of Gentlemen's Houses, and of good Towns, but if we go but a little to the Right Hand South into the said wild Part, 'tis a deep, strong, and in the wet Season, an unpassable Clay.</P>
<P>Here travelling East at the Foot of the Hills, we came to Rygate, a large Market-Town with a Castle, ann a Man∣sion-House, inhabited for some Years by Sir John Parsons, once Lord Mayor of London, and whose Son, an Alderman, has likewise succeeded to that high Post.</P>
<P>Here are two miserable Borough Towns too, which nevertheless send each of them two Members to Parliament, to wit, Gatton under the side of the Hill, almost at Rygate; and Bleechingly, more Eastward on the same Cross-Road, which we were upon before: In the first of there Sir John Thomson, (afterwards Lord Haversham) having purchased the Mannor, was always elected; as Mr. Paul Docminique, an Italian Merchant, has been since: The last was for many Years, the Estate of Sir Robert Claytou, a known Citizen, and Benefactor to the City of London, whose Posterity still enjoy it: And at either Town the Pur∣chasers seem to buy the Election with the Property</P>
<P>At Nurfield, between Rygate and Bleechingly, is another Branch of the Fa∣mily of Evelyn, who having flourished there many Yeark, though in a kind of Retreat, and are often chosen Represen-Representatives for the Town of Bleech∣ingly, which is 'ust at their Door.</P>
<P>From hence, crossing still all the Roads leading from London into Sussex, we come to a Village called Godstone, which lies on the Road from London to Lewis; and keeping on East we come to Wes∣terham, the first Market Town in Rent on that side: This is a neat handsome well built Market Town, and is full of Gentry, and consequently of good Com∣pany.

<P>Croydon is a g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat Corn-Market, but chiefly for Oats and Oatmeal, all for London still; the Town is large, and full of Citizens f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om London, which m kes it so Populous; it is the antient Palace <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Archbishops of Canterbury, and several of them lie buried here; particularly that great Man, Archbishop Whitgift, who not only repaired the Palace, but built the famous Hospital and School, which remains there to this Day, to the singular Honour of the Gi∣ver.</P>
<P>In the Gardens of this Episcopal Pa∣lace, the Lady Dowager Onslow, Mo∣ther of the present Lord of that Name, whom mention has been made, was ve∣ry unhappily d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owned about two Years since, in one of the Fish-ponds; whether she did it herself, or whether by Acci∣dent, or how, 'tis not the Business of such a work as this to enquire; her Daughter being the Wife of Sir John Williams, Merchant of London, had hired the House, and she was in his Fa∣mily.</P>
<P>From hence we passed by Beddington, where is still the Seat, or Mansion House, of Sir Nicholas Crew, it was a fine Building in Mr. Camden's Time; but is now almost Rebuilt from the Ground, by the present Owner, Sir Nicholas Ca∣rew, who now possesses that Estate, nd who is one of the Representatives for the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ of Surrey; the House is magnificently Great, and the Gardens are exquisitely Fine; yet Architests say, that the two Wings are too deep for the Body of the House, that they should ei∣ther have been wider asunder, or not so long; the Court before them is extreme∣ly Fine, and the Canal in the Park, be∣fore the Court, is so well that nothing can be better, having a River running through it; the Gardens are exceeding∣ly enlarged, they take up all the flat part of the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, with Vista's, or Pros∣pects thro' the Park, for Two or Three Miles; the Orange-Trees continue, and are indeed wonderful; they are the only Standard Orange-Trees in England, and have moving Houses to cover them in the Winter; they are loaded with Fruit in the Summer, and the Gardners told us, they have stood in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ground where they now grow above 80 Years.</P>
<P>I am sorry to Record it to the Re∣proach of any Person in their Grave, that the Ancestor of this Family, tho' other∣wise
<PB REF="100" MS="y"/>
a very honest Gentleman, if Fame lies not, was so addicted to Gaming, and so unfortunately over-match'd in his Play, that he lost this noble Seat and Parks, and all the fine Addenda which were then about it, at one Night's Play, some say, at one cast of Dice, to Mr. Harvey of Comb, near Kingston: What Misery had befallen the Family, if the Right of the Winner had been prosecuted with Rigour, as by what I have heard it would have been, is hard to Write: But God had better Things in store for the Gentleman's Posterity than he took thought for himself; and the Estate being Entail'd upon the Heir, the Loser dy'd before it came into Possession of the Winner, and so it has been preserv'd, and the present Gentleman has not reco∣ver'd the Disaster, but as above, has ex∣ceedingly improv'd it all.</P>
<P>From hence it is but a little Mile to Cashalton, a Country Village situate among innumerable Springs of Water, which all together, form a River in the very Street of the Town, and join∣ing the other Springs which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Croyden and Bedington, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Stream which are called the River Wandell. This Village seated among such delight∣ful Springs, is yet all standing upon firm Chalk; and having the Downs close ad∣joining, makes the most agreeable Spot on all this side of London, as is abun∣dantly testify'd by it▪ being, as it were, crowded with fine Houses of the Citizens of London; some of which are built with such a Profusion of Expence, that they look rather like Seats of the Nobility, than the Country Houses of Citizens and Merchants; particularly those of Sir William Sca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, lately deceased; who besides an immense Estate in Money has left, as I was told, one Article of Nine Thousand Pounds a Year to his Heir; and was himself since the Fire of London, only Mr. Seawen, a Ham∣borough Merchant, dealing by Com∣mission, and not in any view of such an en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ease of Wealth, or any thing like it.</P>
<P>The other House is that of Sir John Fellows, late Sub-Governor of the South-Sea Company, who having the Misfor∣tune to fall in the general Calamity of the late Directors, lost all his unhappy Wealth, which he had gain'd in the Company, and a good and honestly got∣ten Estate of his own into the Bargain: I cannot dwell on the Description of all the fine Houses in this and the neigh∣bouring Villages; I shall speak of them again in bulk with their Neighbours, of Mitcham, Stretham, Tooting, Claph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, and others; but I must take a Trip here cross the Downs to Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om.</P>
<P>Banstead Downs needs no Description other than this, that their being so near London, and surrounded as they are with pleasant Villages, and being in themselves perfectly agreeable, the Ground smooth, soft, level and d y; (even in but a few Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) they conspire o make the m st delightful Spot of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, of that kind in all this Part of Britain.</P>
<P>When on the Publick Race Days they are cover'd with Coaches and Ladies, and an innumerable Company of Horse∣men, as well Gentlemen as Citizens, at∣tending the Sport; and then adding to the Beauty of the Sight, the Racers fly∣ing over the Course, as if they either touch'd not, or felt not the Ground they run upon; I think <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Sight, except that of a Victorious Army, under the Com∣mand of a Protestant King of Great Bri∣tain could exceed it.</P>
<P>About four Miles, over th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se delicious Downs, brings us to Epsom, and if you will suppose me to come the e in the Month of July, or thereabouts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may think me to come in the middle of the Season, when the Town is full of Com∣pany, and all disposed to Mirth and Plea∣santry; for abating one u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppy Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Jobbing Year, when England took leave to act the Frantick, for a little while; and when every Body's Heads we e turn'd with Projects and S o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks, I say, except this Year, we see nothing of Business in the whole Conversation of Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om; even the Men of Business, who are really so when in London; whether
<PB REF="101" MS="y"/>
it be at the Exchange, the Alley, or the Treasury Office, and the Court, yet here they look as if they had left all their London Thoughts behind them, and had separated themselves to Mirth and good Company; as if they came hither to un∣bend the Bow of the Mind, and to give themselves a loose to their innocent Plea∣sures; I say, innocent, for such they may enjoy here and such any Man may make his being here, if he pleases.</P>
<P>As, I say▪ this Place seems adapted wholly to Pleasure, so the Town is suited to it; tis all Rural, the Houses are built at large, not many together, with Gar∣dens and Ground about them; that the People who come out of their confin'd Dwellings in London, may have Air and Liberty, suited to the Design of Country Lodgings.</P>
<P>You have no sooner taken Lodgings, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the Apartments, but if you are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thing known, youwalk out, to seewho and who's together; for 'tis the general Language of the Place, Come let's go see the Town, Folks don't come to Epsom to stay within Doors.</P>
<P>The next Morning you are welcom'd with the Musick under your Chamber Window; but for a Shilling or Two you get rid of them, and prepare for going to the Wells.</P>
<P>Here you have the Compliment of the Place, are enter'd into the List of the pleasant Company, so you become a Ci∣tizen of Epsom for that Summer; and this costs you another Shilling, or if you please, Half a Crown: Then Drink the Waters, or walk about as if you did; Dance with the Ladies, tho' it be in your Gown and Slippers, have Musiek and Company of what kind you like, for every Man may sort himself as he pleases; the grave with the grave, and the gay with the gay, the bright, and the wicked; all may be match'd if they seek for it, and perhaps some of the last may be over-match'd, if they are not upon their Guard.</P>
<P>After the Morning Diversions are over, and every one are walk'd home to their Lodgings, the Town is perfectly quiet again; nothing is to be seen, the Green, the great Room, the Raffling-Shops all are (as if it was a Trading Town on a Holiday) shut up; there's little stirring, except Footmen, and Maid Servants, go to and fro of Errands, and Higlers and Butchers, carrying Provisions to People's Lodgings.</P>
<P>This takes up the Town till Dinner is over, and the Company have repos'd for two or three Hours in the heat of the Day; then the first thing you observe is, that the Ladies come to the shady Seats, at their Doors, and to the Benches in the Groves, and cover'd Walks; (of which, every House that can have them, is generally supply'd with several.) Here they refresh with cooling Liquors, a∣greeable Conversation, and innocent Mirth.</P>
<P>Those that have Coaches, or Horses (as soon as the Sun declines) take the Air on the Downs, and those that have not, content themselves with staying a little later, and when the Air grows cool, and the Sun low, they walk out under the Slaer, of the Hedges and Trees, as they find it for their Diversion: In the mean time, towards Evening the Bowl∣ing Green begins to fill, the Musick strikes up in the great Room, and Com∣pany draws together a pace: And here they never fail of abundance of Mirth, every Night being a kind of Ball; the Gentlemen Bowl, the Ladies Dance, others Raffle, and some Rattle; Conver∣sation is the general Pleasure of the Place, till it grows late, and then the Company draws off, and generally speaking, they are pretty well as to keeping good Hours; so that by Eleven a Clock the Dancing generally ends, and the Day closes with good wishes, and appoint∣ments to meet the next Morning at the Wells, or somewhere else.</P>
<P>The retir'd part of the World, of which also there are very many here, have the Waters brought home to their Apart∣ments in the Morning where they Drink and Walk about a little, for assisting the Physical Operation, till near Noon, then dress Dinner, and repose for the Heat as
<PB REF="102" MS="y"/>
others do; after which they Visit, drink Tea, walk Abroad, come to their Lodg∣ings to Supper, then walk again till it grows dark, and then to Bed: The greatest part of the Men, I mean of this Grave sort, may be supposed to be Men of Business, who are at London up∣on Business all the Day, and thronging to their Lodgings at Night, make the Families, generally speaking, rather pro∣vide Suppers than Dinners for 'tis very frequent for the Trading part of the Company to place their Families here, and take their Horses every Morning to London, to the Exchange, to the Alley, or to the Ware house, and be at Epsome again at Night; and I know one Citizen that practis'd it for several Years toge∣ther, and scarce ever lay a Night in London during the whole Season.</P>
<P>This, I say, makes the good Wives satisfy themselves with providing for the Family, rather at Night than at Noon, that their Husbands may eat with them; after which they walk Abroad as above, and these they call the sober Citizens, and those are not much at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lls, or at the Green; except sometimes, when they give themselves a Holiday, or when they get sooner home than usual.</P>
<P>Nor are these which I call the more retir'd part the Company, the least part of those that fill up the Town of Epsom, nor is their way of living so retir'd, but that there is a great deal of Society, Mirth, and good Manners, and good Company among these too.</P>
<P>The fine Park of the late Earl of Berke∣ley, near Epsom, was formerly a great addition of the pleasure of the Place, by the fine Walks and cool Retreats there; but the Earl finding it absolutely necessary, for a known Reason, to shut it up, and not permit any walking there, that Relief to the Company was abated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r some Years; but the Pleasures of Na∣ture are so many round the Town, the shady Frees so every where planted, and now generally well grown, that it makes Epsom like a great Park fill'd with lit∣tle Groves, Lodges and Retrears for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ool <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Air, and Shade from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sun; and I believe, I may say, it is not to be match'd in the World, on that account; at least, not in so little a space of Ground.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd too, that for shady Walks, and innumerable Numbers of Trees planted before the Houses, Epsom differs much from it self, that is to say, as it was twenty or thirty Years ago, for then those Trees that were planted, were generally young, and not grown; a d now not only all the Trees then young, are grown large a d fair, but Thousands are planted since; so that the Town, an and stance, loo s like a great Wood full of Houses, scatter'd every where, all over it.</P>
<P>In the Winter this is no Place for Plea∣sure indeed; as it is full of Mirth and Caiery in the Summer, so the Prospect in the Winter, preseurs you with little, but good Houses shut up, and Windows fasten'd; the Furniture taken down, the Families remov'd, the Walks out of Re∣pair, the Leaves off of the Trees, and the People out of the Town; and which is still worse, the ordinary Ronds both to it, and near it, except only on the the side of the Downs, are deep, stiff, full of Sloughs, and, in a Word, unpas∣sable; for all the Country the side of the Downs, as I have said, only excepted, is a deep stiff Clay; so that there's to riding in the Winter with<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>most Fatigue, and some hazard, and this is the Reason that Epsom is not (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hamp∣stead or Richmond) fu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Company in Winter as well as Summer.</P>
<P>From Epsom that I might tho oughly visit the County of Surrey, I rode over those Clays, and through very bad Roads to Kingston and from thence keeping the Bank of the River on my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣hand, I had a fine view of Ham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Court, at a distance, but had reserv'd it for another Journey; and was bound now in search of a piece of Aeriquity so satisfy my own Curiosity, this was to Oatl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, that I might see the famous Place where Julius <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the Ricer <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ish Army, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>standing they had
<PB REF="103" MS="y"/>
stuck the River full of sharp Stakes for Three Miles together.</P>
<P>The People said several of those Stakes were still to be seen in the Bottom of the River, having stood there for now above 1760 Years; but they cou'd show me none of them, tho' they call the Place Coway Stakes to this Day; I cou'd make little Judgment of the thing, only from this, that it really seems probable, that this was the first Place where Caesar at that time cou'd find the River Fordable, or any way Passable to him, who had no Boats, no Pontons, and no way to make Bridges over, in the Teeth of so Powerful, and so Furious an Enemy; but the Ro∣man Valour and Discipline surmounted all Difficulties, and he pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d the Army, routing the Britons; whose King and Ge∣neral, Cassibellanus, never offer'd a pitch'd Battle to the Romans afterward.</P>
<P>Satisty'd with what little I cou'd see here, which indeed was nothing at all, but the meer Place, said to be so; and which it behov'd me to believe only be∣cause it was not unlikely to be true; I say, satisfy'd with this, I came back directly to Kingstone▪ a good Market-Town, but remarkable for little, only that they say, the Antient British and Saxon Kings were usually Crown'd here in former Times, which I will neither assert or deny.</P>
<P>But keeping the River now on my Left, as I did before on my Right-Hand, draw∣ing near to London, we came to Hame and Peterson, little Villages; the first, famous for a most pleasant Pallace of the late Duke of Lauderdale, close by the River; a House King Charles II. used to be frequently at, and be exceedingly pleased with; the Avenues of this fine House to the Land side, come up to the end of the Village of Peterson, where he Wall of New Park comes also close <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Town, on the other side; in an Angle of which stood a most delicious House, built by the late Earl of Roches∣er, Lord High Treasurer in King James I's Reign, as also in part of Queen Ann's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eign, which Place he discharg'd so well, that we never heard of any any misap∣plications, so much as suggested much less inquir'd after.</P>
<P>I am oblig'd to say only, that this House stood here; for even while this is writing the Place seems to be but Smoaking with the Ruins of a most unhappy Disaster, the whole House being a few Months ago burnt down to the Ground with a Fire, so sudden, and so furious▪ that the Fami∣ly who were all at home, had scarce time to save sheir Lives.</P>
<P>Nor was the House, tho' so exquisitely finished, so Beautiful within and without, the greatest Loss sustained; the rich Fur∣niture, the curious Collection of Paint∣ings; and above all, the most curious Collection of Books, being the Library of the First Earl of Clarendon, Lord Chancellor of England and Author of that most excellent History of the Rebel∣lion, of which the World knows so much; I say this Library, as I am assur'd, was here wholly consum'd; a Loss irreparable, and not to be sufficiently regretted by all Lovers of Learning, having among other valuable Things, several Manuscripts re∣lating to those Times, and to Things tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted by himself, and by the King his Master, both at Home and Abroad; and of other Antient Things, Collected by that Noble and Learned Author in Foreign Count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies; which both for their Variety, Antiquity, and Authority, were of an inestimable Value.</P>
<P>From hence we came to Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hmond, the delightful Retreat of their Royal Highnesses, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and where they have spent the fine Season every Summer for some Years; The Prince's Count being so near must needs have fill d Richmond, which was before a most agreeable Retreat, for the First and Second rate Gentry, with a great deal of the best Company in Eng∣land: This Town and the Country adja∣cent, encrease daily in Buildings, many no∣ble Houses for the Accomodation of such, being lately rais'd and more in P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospect: But 'tis fear'd should the Prince come, for any Cause that may happen, to quit that side of the Country, those nume∣rous Buildings must abate in the Value which is now set upon them: The Com∣pany
<PB REF="104" MS="y"/>
however, at Richmond, is very great in the Winter, when the Prince's Court is not there; because of the Neigh∣bourhood of so many Gentlemen, who live constantly there, and thereabouts; and of its nearness to London also: And in this it has the advantage both of Ep∣some and Tunbridge.</P>
<P>Here are Wells likewise, and a Mine∣ral-Water, which tho' not so much us'd as that at Epsom and Tunbridge, are yet sufficient to keep up the forms of the Place, and bring the Company together in the Morning, as the Musick does in the Evening; and as there is more of Qua∣lity in and about the Place than is ordina∣rily to be seen at Epsome, the Company is more shining, and sometimes even Il∣lustriously bright.</P>
<P>Mr. Temple created Baron Temple, of the Kingdom of Ireland, even since this Circuit was perform'd; and who is the Son and Successor to the Honour, Estate, and great part of the Character of the Great Sir William Temple, has a fine Seat and Gardens (hard by) at Shene; The Gardens are indeed exquisitely fine, being finished, and even contriv'd by the Great Genius of Sir William, his Father; and as they were his last Delight in Life, so they were every way suited to be so, to a Man of Sense and Capacity, who knew what kind of Life was best fitted to make a Man's last Days happy.</P>
<P>It is not easy to describe the Beauty with which the Banks of the Thames shine on either side of the River, from hence to London, much more than our Ancestors, even of but one Age ago, knew any thing of: If for pleasant Vil∣lages, great Houses, Palaces, Gardens, &amp;c. it was true in Queen Elizabeth's Time, according to the Poet, that</P>
<P>The Thames with Royal Tyber may compare.</P>
<P>I say, if this were true at that time, What may be said of it now; When for one fine House that was to be seen then, there are a Hundred; nay for ought I know, Five Hundred to be seen now, even as you sit still in a Boat, and pass up and down the River?</P>
<P>First beginning from Ham-House, above, the Prince's Palace salutes the Eye, being formerly no more than a Lodge in the Park, and by that means belonging to the Ranger, who was then, the (since unhappy) Duke of Ormond, and who, with other Branches of a Noble Estate, lost this among the rest by his Precipitate Retreat from the Parliamentary Justice: I have seen many of the Seats of the No∣bility in France, and some larger, but none finer than this, except such as had been lay'd out at the Royal Expence.</P>
<P>From Richmond to London, the River, sides are full of Villages, and those Vil∣lages so full of Beautiful Buildings, Charming Gardens, and rich Habitations of Gentlemen of Quality, that nothing in the World can imitate it; no, not the Country for Twenty Miles round Paris, tho' that indeed is a kind of Prodigy.</P>
<P>To enumerate the Gentlemen's Houses in their view, would be too long for this Work to describe them, would fill a large Folio; it shall suffice to observe some∣thing concerning the Original of the strange Passion, for fine Gardens, which has commendably possess'd the English Gentlemen of late Years, for 'tis evident it is but of late Years.</P>
<P>It is since the Revolution that our Eng∣lish Gentlemen, began so universally, to adorn their Gardens with those Plants, we call Ever Greens, which leads me to a particular Observation that may not be improper in this Place; King William and Queen Mary introduced each of them Two Customs, which by the People's imi∣tating them became the Two Idols of the Town, and indeed of the whole King∣dom; the Queen brought in (1.) the love of fine East-India Callicoes, such as were then call'd Mislapatan Chints, Atlasses, and fine painted Callicoes, which after∣wards descended into the Humours of the Common People so much, as to make them Greivous to our Trade, and Ruin∣ing to our Manufacturies and the Poor; so that the Parliament were oblig'd to make Two Acts at several times to Re∣strain, and at last Prohibit the use of them: (2.) The Queen brought in the Custom
<PB REF="105" MS="y"/>
or Humour, as I may call it, of furnishing Houses with China Ware, which increased to a strange degree afterwards, piling their China upon the Tops of Cabinets, Scrutores, and every Chimney-Piece, to the tops of the Ceilings, and even setting up Shelves for their China Ware, where they wanted such Places, till it became a Grievan e in the Expence of it, and even injurious to their Families and E∣states.</P>
<P>The good Queen far from desi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning any injury to the Country where she was so entirely belov'd, little thought she was in either of these laying a Foundation for such fatal excesses, and would no doubt have been the first to have reform'd them had she lived to see it.</P>
<P>The King on his part introdac'd (1.) the love of Gardening; and (2.) of Paint¦ing: In the first his Majesty was parti∣cularly delighted with the Decocation of Ever-Greens, as the greatest a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ion to the Beauty of a Garden, preserving the Figure of the Place, even in the rough∣est part of an inclement and tempestuous Winter.</P>
<P>Sir Stephen Fox's Gardens at Istle worth, and Sir William Temple's at Eastshene, mentioned above were the only two Gardens where they had entirely persued this Method at that time, and of Sir Stephen's Gardens this was to be said, that almost all his fine Ever-Greens were raised in the places where they stood; Sir Stephen taking as much delight to see them rise gradually, and form them into what they were to be, as to buy them of the Nursery Gardiners finish'd to his Hand; besides, that by this Me∣thod his Greens, the finest in England, cost him nothing but the Labour of his Servants, and about ten Years Patience; which if they were to have been pur∣chased, would not have cost so little as Ten Thousand Pounds, especially at that time. It was here that K. William was so pleased, that according to his Majesty's usual Expression, when he lik'd a Place very well, he stood, and looking round him from the Head of one of the Canals, Well, says his Majesty, I cou'd dwell here five Days; every thing was so exquisitely centriv'd, finish'd, and well kept, that the King, who was al∣low'd to be the best judge of such Things then living in the World, did not so much as once say, this or that thing cou'd have been better.</P>
<P>With the particular judgment of the King, all the Gentlemen in England began to fall in; and in a few Years fine Gardens, and fine Houses began to grow up in every corner; the King be∣gan with the Gardens at Hampton Court and Kensington, and the Gentlemen fol∣low'd every where, with such a Gust that the Alteration is indeed wonderful thro' the whole Kingdom; but no where more than in the two Counties of Mid∣dlesex and Surrey, as they border on the River Thames; the Beauly and Expence of which are only to be wonder'd at, not describ'd; they may indeed be guess'd at, by what is seen is One or Two such as these nam'd: But I think to enter into a particular of them would be an intoller∣able Task, and tedious to the Reader.</P>
<P>That these Houses and Gardens are ad∣mirably beautiful in th ir kind, and in their separate, and distinct Beauti s, such as their Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uation, Decoration, Architect, Furnitu e, and the like, must be granted; and many Descriptions have been accu∣rately given of them, as of Ham-House, Kew Green the Prince's House, Sir Wm. Temple's, Sir Charles Hedgts, Sion-House, O sterly, Lord Runel gh's at Chelsea Hospi al; the many noble Seats in Istle∣worth, Twittenham, Hammersmi h, Ful∣ham, Putney, Chelsea, Battersea, and the like.</P>
<P>But I find none has spoken of what I call the distant Glory of all these Buildings: There is a Beauty in these Things at a distance, taking them en Passans, and in Perspective, which few People value, and fewer understand; and yet here they are more truly great, than in all their private Beauties whatsoever: Here they reflect Beauty, and Magnificence upon the whole Country, and give a kind of a Character to the Island of Creat Britain in general.

It is impossible in one Journey to de∣scribe effectually this part of the County of Surrey lying from Kingston to Lon∣don and Greenwich, where I set out: That is, including the Villages of Rich∣mond, Petersham, Eastshene, Mortlock, Putney, Wandsworth, Barn-Elms, Bat∣tersey, Wimbleton, Tooting, Clapham, Camberwell, Peckham and Deptford; the Description would swell with the Stories of Private Families, and of the Reasons of these opulent Foundations, more than with their History.</P>
<P>It would also take up a large Chapter in this Book, to but mention the over∣throw, and Catastrophe of innumerable Wealthy City Families, who after they have thought their Houses establish'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built their Magnificent Country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well as others, have sunk un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Misfortunes of Business, and the Disasters of Trade, after the World has thought them pass'd all possibility of Dan∣ger such as Sir Joseph Hodges, Sir Justus Beck, the Widow Cock at Camberwell, and many others; besides all the late South-Sea Directors, all which I chuse to have forgotten, as no doubt they desire to be, in Recording the Wealth and Opu∣lence of this Part of England, which I doubt not to convince you infinitely out does the whole World.</P>
<P>I am come now to Southwark, a Sub∣urb to, rather than a Part of London; But of which this may be said with Jus∣tice.</P>
<P>A Royal City were not London by.</P>
<P>To give you a brief Description of South-wark, it might be call'd a long Street, of about Nine Miles in length, as it is now built on Eastward; reaching from Vaux-Hall to London-Bridge, and from the Bridge to Deptford, and up to Deptford-Bridge, which parts it from Greenwich, all the way winding and turning as the River winds and turns; ex∣cept only in that Part, which reaches winds more than the River does.</P>
<P>In the Center, which is opposite to the Bridge, it is thicken'd with Buildings, and may be reckon'd near a Mile broad, (Viz) from the Bridge to the End of Kent-street and Blackman-street, and a∣bout the Mint; but else the whole Build∣ing is but narrow, nor indeed can it be otherwise; considering the length of it.</P>
<P>The Principal Beauty of the Burrough of Southwark, consists in the prodigious Number of its Inhabitants, Take it as it was Antiently bounded, it contain'd Nine Parishes; but as it is now extended, and, as I say, joins with Deptford, it contains Eleven large Parishes: Accord∣ing to the Weekly-Bills, for the Year 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2, the Nine Parishes only bury'd 4166, which is about one Sixth Part of the whole Body, call'd London; the Bill of Mortallity for that Year, amounting in all to 25750.</P>
<P>The first Thing we meet with consi∣derable, is at the Spring-Garden, just at the Corner, where the Road turns away to go from Vauxs-Hall Turnpike, towards Newington, there are the Remains of the Old Lines cast up in the Times of the Rebellion, to Fortify this Side of the Town; and at that Corner was a very large Bastion, or rather a Fort, and such indeed they call it; which Commanded all the Pass on that Side, and farther on, where the Openings near St. George's-Fields are▪ which they now call the Ducking-Pond, there was another; the Water they call the Ducking Pond, is evidently to this Day the Moat of the Fort, and the Lines are so high, and so undemolish'd still, that a very little mat∣ter would Repair and perfect them a∣gain.</P>
<P>From hence they turn'd South East, and went to the Windmill, at the End of Blackman street, where they cross'd the Road, and going to the End of Kent-street, we see another great Bastion; and then turning S. E. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill they come to the End of Barnaby-street, or rather beyond, among the Tanners, and there you see another Fort, so plain, and so undemo∣lish'd
<PB REF="108" MS="y"/>
the Grass growing now over the Works, that it is as plain at it was, even when it was thrown down.</P>
<P>Here is also another Remain of Anti∣tiquity, the Ves<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igies of which are easy to be traced; viz. the Place where by strength of Men's Hands, they turn'd the Channel of this great River of Thames, and made a new Course for the Wa∣ters, while the great Bridge, which is now standing, was built: Here it is evident they turn'd the Waters out, viz. About a Place call'd Nine Elms, just beyond Vaux-Hall, where now a little Brook, from the Wash-way at Kenning∣ton, and which they once attempted to make Navigable, enters the Thames, from thence it cross'd the great Road, a little beyond the end of the Houses in Newington; between which and Ken∣nington Common, on the left of the Road, as you go South, there is a very large Pond, or Lake of Water, part of the Channel not fill'd up to this Day; from thence it enter'd the Marshes between Rotheriff and Deptford, where so many Years after there remained a Drain for the Water, upon which was a large Mill Pond and Dam, and where since was built the second great Wet Dock, said to belonging to the Duke of Bedford's Estate, and call'd at first Snell∣grove's Dock, because built by one Mr. Snellgrove, a Shipwright, whose Build∣ing Yards adjoin'd it. A farther De∣scription of Southwark, I refer till I come to London, as one general Appellation for the two Cities of London and West∣minster; and all the Borough of South∣wark, and all the Buildings and Villages included within the Bills of Mortality, make but one in London, in the general Appellation, of which in its Order</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY III.</HEAD>
<P>I Find so much left to speak of, and so many Things to say in every Part of England, that my Journey cannot be barren of Intelligence, which way soever I turn; no, tho' I were to oblige myself to say nothing of any Time that had been spoken of before.</P>
<P>I intended once to have gone due West this Journey; but then I should have been obliged to croud my Observations so close, to bring Hampton Court, Windsor, Blenheim, Oxford, the Bath and Bristol, all into one Journey; all those remarkable Places lying in a Line, as it were in one Point of the Company; as to have my Journey too long, or my Observations too light and superficial, as others have done before me.</P>
<P>This Journey will divide the weighty Task, and consequently make it sit light∣er on the Memory, be pleasanter to the Reader, and make my Progress the more regular. I shall therefore take in Hamp∣ton Court and Windsor in this Journey; the first at my setting out, and the last at my return, and the rest as their Situation demands.</P>
<P>As I came down from Kingston, in my last Journey, by the South Bank of
<PB REF="109" MS="y"/>
the Thamea, on the Surrey Side of the River; so I go up to Hampton-Court, now, on the North Bank, and on the Middlesex Side, which I mention, be∣cause as the Sides ef the Country border∣ing on the River, lie parallel, so the Beauty of the Country, the pleasant Si∣tuations, the Glory of innumerable fine Buildings, Noblemens and Gentlemens Houses, and Citizens Retreats, are so equal a Match to what I had described on the other Side, that one knows not which to give the Pref rence to: But as I must speak of them again, when I come to write of the County of Middlesex, which I have now purposely emitted; so I pass them over here, except the Pa∣l ce of Hamp on only, which I mention'd in Middl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sex, for the Reasons above.</P>
<P>Hampton Court lyes on the North Bank of the River Thames, about two small Miles from Kingston, and on the Road from Stanes to Kinston Bridge; so that the Road straightening the Parks a lit le, they were obliged to pa t the Parks, and le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the Paddock▪ and the great Park, part on the other Side the Road; a Testi∣mony of that just Regard that the Kings of England always had, and still have, to the common Good, and to the Service of the Country, that they would not in terrupt the Course of the Road, or cause the poor People to go out of the Way of their Busines<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to or from the Markets and F irs, for any Pleasure of their own whatsoeber.</P>
<P>The Palace of Hampton-Court was first founded, and built from the Ground, by that great Statesman, and Favorite of King Henry VIII. Cardinal Woolsey; aS<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if it be a just Observation any where, as is made from the Situation of the old Ab∣bies and Monastries, the Clergy were ex∣cellent Judges of the Beauty and Pleasant∣ness of the Country, and chose always to plant in the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st; I say, if it was a just Observation in any Case, it was in this; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if there be a Situation on the whole River between <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tanes-Bridge and Windsor-Bridge, pleasanter than anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, it is this of Hampton; close to the River, yet not offended by the rising of its Waters in Floods, or S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orms, near to the Reflux of the Tides, but not quite so near as to be affected with any Foulness of the Wa∣ter▪ which the flowing of the Tides ge∣nerally is the Occasion of. The Gardens extend almost to the Bank of the River▪ yet are never overflowed; nor are there any Marshes on either Side the River to make the Waters stagnate, or the Air unwhole∣some on that account. The River is high enough to be navigable, and low enough to be a little pleasantry rapid; so that the Stream looks always che<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rful, not slow and sleeping, like a Pond. This keeps the Waters always clear and clean, the bot∣tom in View, it has ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry thing that can make an Inland; or, as I may call it, a Country River, pleasant and agreeable.</P>
<P>I shall sing you no Songs here of the River in the first Person of a Water Nymph, a Goddess (and I know not what) according to the Humour of the ancient Poets. I shall talk nothing of the Marriage of old Isis, the Male River, with the beau iful Thame, the Female Ri∣ver, a Whimsy as simple as the Subject was empty, but I shall speak of the River as Occasion presents, as it really is made glo∣rious by the Splendor of its Shores, gilded with noble Palaces, strong Fortifications, large Hospitals, and publick Buildings; with the greatest Bridge, and the greatest City in the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, made famous by the Opulence of its Merchants, the Encrease and Extensiveness of its Commerce; by invincible Navies, and by the innumerable Fleets of Ships failing upon it, to and from all Parts of the World.</P>
<P>As I meet with the River upwards in my Travels thro' the Inland Country, I shall speak of it, as it is the Chanel for conveying an infinite Quantity of Provi∣sions from remote Counties to London, and enriching all the Counties again that lye near it, by the return of Wealth and Trade from the City; and in describing these Things I expect both to inform and divert my Readers, and speak, in a more masculine Mann r, m re to the Dignity of the Subject, and also more to their
<PB REF="110" MS="y"/>
Satisfacti n, than I could do any other way.</P>
<P>There is little more to be said of the Thames, relating to Hampton-Court, than that it adds, by its Neighbourhood, to the Pleasure of the Situation; for as to passing by Water too and from Lon∣don, though in Summer, 'tis exceeding pleasant, yet the Passage is a little too long to make it easy to the Ladies, espe∣cially to be crowded up in the small Boats, which usually go on the Thames for Pleasure.</P>
<P>The Prince and Princess, indeed, I re∣member, came once down by Water, upon the Occasion of her Royal High∣ness's being great with Child, and near her Time; so near, that she was deli∣ver'd within two or three Days after. But this Passage being in the Royal Barg∣es, with strength of Oars, and the Day exceeding fine, the Passage, I say, was made very pleasant, and still the more so, for being short. Again, this Passage is all the Way with the Stream, whereas, in the common Passage, upwards, great Part of the Way is against the Stream, which is slow and heavy.</P>
<P>But be the going and coming how it will by Water, 'tis an exceeding plea∣sant Passage by Land, whether we go by the Surrey side or the Middlesex side of the Water, of which I shall say more in its place.</P>
<P>The Situation of Hampton-Court be∣ing thus mentioned, and its Founder, 'tis to be mentioned next, that it fell to the Crown in the Forfeiture of his Eminence the Cardinal, when the King seiz'd his Effectts and Estate, by which this and Whitehall, another House of his own building also, came to King Henry VIII. two Palaces fit for the Kings of England, erected by one Cardinal, are standing Monuments of the excessive Pride, as well as the immense Wealth of that Prelate, who knew no Bounds of his Insolence and Ambition, 'till he was o∣verthrown at once by the Displeasure of his Master.</P>
<P>Whoever knew Hampton-Court before it was begun to be Rebuilt, or altered, by the late King William, must acknow∣ledge, it was a very compleat Palace before, and fit for a King; and though it might not, according to the modern Method of Building, or of Gardening, pass for a Thing exquisitely fine; yet it had this remaining to itself, and perhaps peculiar; namely, that it shewed a Situ∣ation exceedingly capable of Improve∣ment, and of being made one of the most delightful Palaces in Europe.</P>
<P>This her Majesty Queen Mary was so sensible of, that while the King had ordered the pulling down the old Apart∣ments, and building it up in that most beautiful Form, which we see them now appear in, her Majesty, impatient of en∣joying so agreeable a Retreat, fix'd upon a building formerly made use of chiefly for landing from the River, and there∣fore called the Water Galley; and here▪ as if she had benn conscious that she had but a few Years to enjoy it, she ordered all the little neat curious Things to be done, which suited her own Convenien∣ces, and made it the pleasantest little Thing within Doors that could possibly be made, tho' its Situation being such, as it could not be allowed to stand after the great Building was finished; we now see no remains of it.</P>
<P>The Queen had here her Gallery of Beauties, being the Pictures, at full Length of the principal Ladies attending her Majesty, or who were frequently i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her Retinue; and this was the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beautiful Sight, because the Original were all in Being, and often to be com¦pared with their Pictures Her Majesty had here a fine Apartment, with a S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Lodgings for her private Retreat on¦ly, but most exquisitely furnished; parti¦cularly a fine Chints Bed, then a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Curiosity; another of her own Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> while in Holland, very Magnifice▪ and several others; and here was all her Majesty's fine Collection of De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Ware▪ which indeed was very large an
<PB REF="111" MS="y"/>
fine; and here was also a vast Stock of fine China Ware, the like whereof was not then to be seen in England; the long Gallery, as above, was fill'd with this China, and every other place, where it could be plac'd, with advantage.</P>
<P>The Queen had here also a small Bath▪ing-room, made very fine, suited either to hot or cold Bathing, as the Season should invite; also a Dai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, with all its Conveniencies, in which her Majesty took great Delight: All these things were finished with expedition, that here their Majesties might repose while they saw the main Building go forward. While this was doing, the Gardens were laid out, the Plan of them devised by the King himself; and especially the Amendments and Alterations were made by the King, or the Queen's particular special Com∣mand, or by both; for their Majesties a∣greed so well in their Fancy, and had both so good Judgment in the just Pro∣portion of things, which are the princi∣pal Beauties of a Garden, that it may be said, they both ordered every thing that was done.</P>
<P>Here the fine Parcel of Limes, which form the Semi circle, on the South-front of the House, by the Iron Gates, looking into the Park, were, by the dextrous Hand of the head Gardener removed, after some of them had been almost thirty Years planted in other places, tho not far off. I know the King of France, in the Decoration of the Gardens of Versailles, had Oaks removed, which, by their Di∣mensions must have been above an hun∣dred Years old, and yet were taken up with so much Art, and by the Strength of such Engines, by which such a monste rous Quantity of Earth was raised with them, that the Trees could not feel their remove; that is to say, their Growth was not at all hinder'd. This, I confess, makes the Wonder much the less in those Trees at Hampton-Court Gardens; but the Performance was not the less diffi¦cult or nice, however, in these, and they thrive perfectly well.</P>
<P>While the Gardens were thus laid out the King also directed the laying the Pipes for the Fountain and Jette d'Eau's; and particularly the Dimensions of them, and what Quantity of Water they should cast up, and encreas'd the Number of them after the first Design.</P>
<P>The Ground on the Side of the other Front, has receiv'd some Alterations since the taking down the Water Gallery; but not that Part immediately next the Lodg∣ings: The Orange Trees and fine Dutch Bays, are plac'd within the Arches of the Building under the first Floor: so that the lower Part of the House was all one as a Green House for some Time: Here stands advanced, on two Pedestals of Stone, two Marble Vases, or Flower∣pots, of most exquisite Workmanship; the one done by an Englishman, and the other by a German: 'Tis hard to say which is the best Performance, tho' the doing of it was a kind of Tryal of Skill between them; but it gives us Room, without any Partiality, to say they were both Masters of their Art.</P>
<P>The Parterre on that Side descends from the Terrass Walk by Steps, and on the Left a Terrass goes down to the Water-side, from which the Garden on the Eastward Front is over-looked, and gives a most pleasant Prospect.</P>
<P>The fine Scrolls and Bordure of these Gardens were at first edged with Box; but on the Queen's disliking the Smell, those Edgings were taking up, but have since been planted again, at least in many Places, nothing ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing so fair and regu∣lar an Edging as Box, or is so soon brought to its er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection.</P>
<P>On the North Side of the House, where the Gardens seemed to want skreening from the Weather, or the View of the Chapel, and some part of the old Building required to be covered from the Eye; the vacant Ground, which was large, is very happily cast into a Wilder∣ness, with a Labyrinth, and Espaliers so high, that they effectually take off all that part of the old Building, which would have been offensive to the Sight. This Labyrinth, and Wilderness is not only well design'd, and compleatly finished, but is perfectly well kept and the Espaliers fill'd exactly, at Bottom to the very G ound, and
<PB REF="112" MS="y"/>
are led up to proportion'd Heights on the Top; so that nothing of that kind can be more beautiful.</P>
<P>The House itself is every way answer∣able on the outside to the beautiful Prospect, and the two Fronts are the largest, and, beyond Comparison, the finest of the Kind in England: The great Stairs go up from the second Court of the Palace on the Right Hand, and lead you to the South P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospect.</P>
<P>I hinted in my last that King Wil∣liam brought into England the Love of fine Paintings, as well as that of fine Gardens; and you have an Example of it in the Cartoons, as they are call'd, being five Pieces of such Paintings, as, if you will believe Men of nice Judgment and great Travelling are not to be match'd in Europe: The Stories are known, but especially two of them, viz. that of St. Paul preaching on Mars Hill to the self-wise Athenians, and that of St. Peter passing Sentence of Death on A∣nanias; I say, these two strike the Mind with the utmost Surprize; the Passions are so drawn to the Life, Astonishment, Terror and Death in the Face of Ananias; Zeal and a sacred Fire in the Eyes of the blessed Apostle; Fright and Surprize upon the Countenances of the Beholders in the Piece of Ananias; all these de∣scribe themselves so naturally, that you cannot but seem to discover something of the like Passions, even in seeing them.</P>
<P>In the other, there is the Boldness and Courage with which St. Paul under∣took to talk to a sett of Men, who he knew despis'd all the World, as think-themselves able to teach them any thing: In the Audience, there is anticipating Pride and Conceit in some, a Smile or Fleer of Contempt in others, but a kind of sensible Conviction, tho' crush▪d in its beginning, on the Faces of the rest; and all together appear consounded, but have little to say, and know nothing at all of it, they gravely put him off to hear here him another Time; all these are seen in the very Dress of the Face; that is, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Countenances which they hold while they listen to the new Doctrine which the Apostle preached to a People at that Time ignorant of it.</P>
<P>The other of the Cartoons are exceed∣ing fine; but I mention these as the par∣ticular two which are most lively, which strike the Fancy the soonest at first view 'Tis reported, but with what Truth, know not, that the late French King of fer'd an hundred thousand Louis d'On for these Pictures; but this, I say, is but a Report: The King brought a great many other fine Pieces to England, and with them the Love of fine Painting so universally spread itself among the Nobi∣lity and Persons of Figure all over the Kingdom, that it is incredible what Col∣lections have been made by English Gentlemen since that Time; and how all Europe has been rumag'd, as we may say, for Pictures to bring over h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ther, where, for twenty Years, they yielded the Purchasers, such as collected them for Sale, immense Profit. But the Rates are abated since that, and we begin to be glutted with the Copies and Frauds of the Dutch and Flemish Painters, who have imposed grosly upon us. But to return to the Palace of Hamp∣ton Court; Queen Mary liv'd not to see it compleatly finish'd; and her Death with the other Difficulties of that Reign put a stop to the Works for some Time till the King reviving his good liking of the Place, set them to work again as we see it: But I have been assu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that had the Peace continu'd, and the King liv'd to enjoy the Continuance of it, his Majesty had resolv'd to have pull'd down all the Remains of the old Building; such as the Chapel, and the large Court within the first Gate, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to have built up the whole Palace after the manner of those two Fronts already done. In these would have been a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> entire sett of Rooms of State for the re∣ceiving, and, if Need had been, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dg▪ing, and entertaining any foreign Prince, with his Retinue; also Offices for all the Secretaries of State, Lords of the Treasu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and of Trade; to have repair'd to for
<PB REF="113" MS="y"/>
the Dispatch of such Business, as it might be necessary to have done there upon the Kings longer Residence there than ordi∣nary; as also Apartments for all the great Officers of the Houshold; so that had the House had two great Squares added, as was design'd, there would have been no Room to spare, or that would not have been very well fill'd: But the King's Death put an end to all these Things.</P>
<P>Since the Death of K. William Hamp∣ton Court seem'd abandon'd of its Pa¦tron: They have gotten a kind of Pro∣verbial saying relating to Hampton Court, viz. That it has been generally chosen by every other Prince, since it became a House of Note. K. Charles was the first tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> delighted in it since Queen Eliza∣beth's Time; as for the Reigns before, it was but newly forfeited to the Crown, and was not made a Royal House till King Charles I. who was not only a Prince that delighted in Country Retire∣ments, but knew how to make Choice of them by the Beauty of their Situation, the Goodness of the Air, &amp;c. he took great Delight here, and had he liv'd to enjoy it in Peace, had purpos'd to make it another▪ Thing than it was. But we all know what took him off from that Felicity, and all others; and this House was at last made one of his Pri∣sons by his Rebelsious Subjects.</P>
<P>His Son, K. Charles II. may well be said to have an Aversion to the Place, for the Reason just mention'd▪ namely, the Treatment his Royal Father met with there; and particularly that the Rebel and Murderer of his Father, Cromwell, after∣wards possess'd this Palace, and revel'd here in the Blood of the Royal Party, as he had done in that of his Sovereign King. Charles II▪ therefore chose Windsor, and bestow'd a vast Sum in beautifying the Castle there, and which brought it to the Perfection we see it in at this Dry; some few Alterations excepted, done in the Time of Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g William.</P>
<P>King William, for King James is not to be named as to his Choice of retir'd Palaces, his Delight running quite ano∣ther way; I say, King William fix'd up∣on Hampton-Court; and it was in his Reign that Hampton Court put on new Cloaths, and being dress'd gay and glo∣rious, made the Figure we now see it in.</P>
<P>The late Queen, taken up for Part of her Reign in her kind Regards to the Prince her Spouse, was obliged to reside where her Care of his Health confin'd her, and in this Case kept, for the most Part at Kensington, where he died; but her Majesty always discovered her Delight to be at Windsor, where she chose the little House, as 'twas called, opposite to the Castle, and took the Air in her Chaise in the Parks and Forest, as she saw Occasion.</P>
<P>Now Hampton-Court, by the like al∣ternative▪ is come into Request again; and we find his late Majesty, who was a good Judge too of the Pleasantness and Situation of a Place of that Kind, did take Hampton-Court into his Favour, and made it much his Choice for the Summer's Retreat of the Court, and where they did then enjoy the Diver∣sions of the Season; When Hampton-Court will find such another favourable Juncture as in King William's Time, when the remainder of her Ashes shall be swept away, and her compleat Fabric, as design'd by King William shall be fi∣nish'd, I cannot tell; but if ever that shall be, I know no Palace in Europe, Verfailles excepted, which can come up to her, either for Beauty or Magnifi∣cence, or for Extent of Building, and the Ornaments attending it.</P>
<P>From Hampton Court I directed my my Course for a Journey into the South West Part of England; and, to take up my Beginning where I concluded my last, I cross'd to Che<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tsey on the Thames, a Town I mention'd before; from whence crossing the Black Desert, as I call'd it, of Bagshot Heath, I directed my Course for Hampshire, or Hantshire, and particular∣ly for Basingstoke; that is to say, that a little before I pass'd into the great we∣stern Road upon the Heath, somewhat west of Bagshot, at a Village call'd Black∣water,
<PB REF="114" MS="y"/>
and enter'd Hampshire, near Hart∣leroe.</P>
<P>Before we reach Basingstoke, we get rid of that unpleasant Country, which I so often call a Desart, and enter into a pleasant fertile Country, enclosed and cul∣tivated like the rest of England; and pas∣sing a Village or two, we enter Basing∣stoke, in the midst of Woods and Pastures, rich and fertile, and the Country accord∣ingly spread with the Houses of the No∣bility and Gentry, as in other Places: On the Right Hand, a little before we come to the Town, we pass at a small Distance the famous Fortress, so it was then, of Basing, being a House belonging then to the Marquss of Winchester, the great An∣cestor of the present Family of the Dukes of Bolton.</P>
<P>This House, garrison'd by a resolute Band of old Soldiers, was a great Curb to the Rebels of the Parliament Party, al∣most thro' that whole War; till it was, after a vigorous Defence, yielded to the Conquerors, by the inevitable Fate of Things at that Time. The old House is indeed demolish'd; but the Successor of the Family, the first Duke of Bolton, has erected a very noble Fabrick in the same Place, or near it, which, however, is not equal to the Magnificence which Fame gives to the ancient House, whose Strength of Building only, besides the Out-works, withstood the Battery of Can∣non in several Attacks, and repulsed the Round-heads, three or four times, when they attempted to besiege it: 'Tis in∣credible what Booty the Garrison of this Place picked up, lying as they did, just on the Western Road, where they inter∣cepted the Carriers, plunder'd the Wag∣gons, and suffered nothing to pass; to the great Interruption of the Trade of the City of London.</P>
<P>Basingstoke is a large populous Market Town, has a good Market for Corn, and lately, within a very few Years, is fallen into a Manufacture, viz. Of making Druggets and Shallons, and such slight Goods, which, however, employs a good Number of the poor People, and enables them to get their Bread, which knew not how to get it before.</P>
<P>From hence the great Western Road goes on to Whitchurch and Andover, two Market Towns, and sending Members to Parliament; at the last of which, the Downs, or open Country, begins, which we in general, tho' falsly, called Sali<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bury-Plain: But my Resolution being to take in my view what I had passed by before; I was obliged to go off to the Left Hand, to Alresford and Winche∣ster.</P>
<P>Alresford was a flourishing Market Town, and remarkable for this; That tho' it had no great Trade, and particu∣larly very little, if any Manufactures, yet there was no Collection in the Town for the Poor, nor any Poor low enough to take Alms of the Parish, which is what I do not think can be said of any Town in England besides.</P>
<P>But this unhappy Circumstance, which so distinguished Alresford from all her Neighbours, was brought to an End in the Year—, when, by a sudden and surprizing Fire, the whole Town, with both the Church and the Market-House, was reduc'd to a heap of Rubbish; and, except a few poor Hutts at the remo∣test Ends of the Town, not a House left standing: The Town is since that very handsomely rebuilt, and the neighbour∣ing Gentlemen contributed largely to the Relief of the People, especially, by send∣ing Timber towards their Building: also their Market house is handsomely built, but the Church not yet, tho' we hear there is a Fund raising likewise for that.</P>
<P>Here is a very large Pond, or Lake of Water, kept up to a Head, by a stro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Batterd'eau, or Dam, which the People tell us was made by the Romans; and that it is to this Day part of the great Roman Highway, which leads from Win∣chester to Alton, and, as 'tis supposed went on to London, tho' we no where see any Remains of it, except between Winchester and Alton, and chiefly be∣tween this Town and Alton.</P>
<P>Near this Town, a little North-West, the Duke of Bolton has another Seat, which, tho' not large, is a very handsome beautiful Palace, and the Gardens not only
<PB REF="115" MS="y"/>
very exact, but very finely situate, the Prospect and Visto's Noble and Great, and the whole very well kept.</P>
<P>From hence, at the End of seven Miles over the Downs, we come to the very ancient City of Winchester; not only the great Church, which is so famous all over Europe, and has been so much talk'd of, but even the whole City has, at a Distance▪ the Face of Venerable, and looks ancient a far off; and yet here are many modern Buildings too, and some very handsome; as the College Schools; with the Bishop's Palace, built by Bishop Morley, since the late Wars; the old Palace of the Bishop having been ruin'd by that known Church Incendiary, Sir William Waller, and his Crew of Plunderers; who, if my Information is not wrong, as I believe it is not, de∣stroy'd more Monuments of the Dead, and defac'd more Churches, than all the Round-heads in England beside.</P>
<P>This Church, and the Schools, also are accurately describ'd by several Writers, especially by the Monasticon, where their Antiquity and Original is fully set forth: The Outside of the Church is as plain and Course, as if the Founders and abhor'd Ornaments, or that William of Wickham had been a Quaker, or at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast a Quietist: There is neither Statue, or a Nich for a Statue, to be seen on all the Outside; no carv'd Work, no Spires, Towers, Pinacles, Balustrades, or any Thing; but meer Walls, Buttresses, Win∣dows, and Coins, necessary to the Sup∣port and Order of the Building. It has no Steeple, but a short Tower cover'd flat, as if the top of it had fallen down, and it had been cover'd in haste to keep the Rain out, till they had time to build it up again.</P>
<P>But the Inside of the Church has many very good things in it, and worth Obser∣vation; it was for some Ages the Burying Place of the English Saxon Kings; whose Reliques, at the repair of the Church, were collected by Bishop Fox, and, be∣ing put together into large Wooden Chests, lin'd with Lead were again in∣terr'd at the Foot of the great Wall in the Choir, three on one Side, and three on the other; with an Account whose Bones are in each Chest, whether the Division of the Reliques might be depended upon, has been doubted, but is not thought ma∣terial, so that we do but believe they are all there.</P>
<P>The Choir of the Church appears very magnificent; the Roof is very high, and the Gothick Work in the arch d Part is very fine, tho' very old; the Painting in the Windows is admirably good, and easy to be distinguish'd by those that un∣derstand those Things: The Steps ascend∣ing to the Choir make a very fine Show, having the Statues of King James▪ and his Son King Charles, in Copper, finely cast; the first on the Right Hand▪ and the other on the Left, as you go up to the Choir.</P>
<P>The Choir is said to be the longest in England; and as the Number of Preben∣daries, Canons, &amp;c. are many, it re∣quir'd such a length The Ornaments of the Choir are the Effects of the Boun∣ty, of several Bishops; the fine Altar, (the noblest in England by much▪ was done by Bishop Morley; the Roof and the Coat of Arms of the Saxon and Norman K ngs, were done by Bishop Fox; and the fine Throne, for the Bishop in the Choir, was given by Bishop Mew, in his Life-time; nd it was well it was; for if he had order'd it by Will, there is Reason to believe it had never been done: That Reverend Prelate, notwithstanding he enjoy'd so rich a Bishoprick, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce leaving Money enough behind him, to pay for his Coffin.</P>
<P>There are a great many Persons of Rank bury'd in this Church, besides the Saxon Kings, mention'd above; and besides se∣veral of the most eminent Bishops of the See: Just under the Altar lyes a Son of William the Conqueror▪ without any Monument; and behind the Altar, under a very fine and venerable Monument, lyes the famous Lord Treasurer, Weston, late Earl of Portland, Lord High Treasurer of England under King Charles I. His Effigy is in Copper Armour, at full length, with his Head rais'd on three Cushions of the
<PB REF="116" MS="y"/>
same, and is a very magnificent Work: There is also a very fine Monument of Cardinal Beaufort, in his Cardinal's Robes and Hat.</P>
<P>The Monument of Sir John Cloberry is extraordinary, but more, because it puts Strangers upon enquiring into his Story, than for any thing wonderful in the Figure, it being cut in a modern Dress; the Habit Gentlemen wore in those Times, which, being now so much out of Fashion, appears mean enough: But this Gentleman's Story is particular, being the Person solely entrusted with the Secret of the Restoration of K. Charles II. as the Messenger that pass'd between General Monk on one Hand, and Mr. Montague, and others entrusted by King Charles II. on the other Hand: which he manag'd so faithfully, as to effect that memorable Event, to which Eng∣land owes the Felicity of all her happy Days since that Time, by which faithful Service, Sir John Cloberry, then a pri∣vate Musqueteer only, rais'd himself to the Honour of a Knight, with the Re∣ward of a good Estate from the Bounty of the King.</P>
<P>Every Body that goes into this Church, and reads what is to be read there, will be told, that the Body of the Church was built by the famous William of Wickham; whose Monument, intimat∣ing his Fame, lies in the middle of that Part, which was built at his Ex∣pence.</P>
<P>He was a Courtier before a Bishop; and, tho' he had no great Share of Learn∣ing, he was a great Promoter of it, and a Lover of learned Men▪ His natural Ge∣nius was much beyond his acquir'd Parts, and his Skill in Politicks beyond his Eccle∣siastick Knowledge. He is said to have put his Master. King Edward III. to whom he was Secretary of State, upon the two great Projects which made his Reign so glorious, viz. First, Upon set∣ting up his Claim to the Crown of France, and pushing that Claim by Force of Arms, which brought on the War with France, in which that Prince was three times victorious in battle. (2.) Upon setting up, or instituting the Order of the Garter; in which he (being before that made Bishop of Winchester) ob∣tain'd the Honour for the Bishops of Winchester, of being always Prelates of the Order, as an Appendix to the Bi∣shoprick; and he himself was the first Prelate of the Order, and the Ensigns of that Honour are join'd with his Epis∣copal Ornaments, in the robing of his Effigy on the Monument above.</P>
<P>To the Honour of this Bishop, there are other Foundations of his, as much to his Fame as that of this Church, of which I shall speak in their Order; but particularly the College in this City, which is a noble Foundation indeed: The Building consists of two large Courts, in which are the Lodgings for the Ma∣sters and Scholars, and in the Center a very noble Chapel; beyond that, in the second Court, are the Schools, with a large Cloyster beyond them, and some Enclosures laid open for the Diversion of the Scholars. There also is a great Hall, where the Scholars dine: The Funds for the Support of this College are very con∣siderable; the Masters live in a very good Figure, and their Maintenance is sufficient to support it: They have all separate Dwellings in the House and all possible Conveniencies appointed them.</P>
<P>The Scholars have Exhibitions at a cer∣tain Time of Countinuance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, if they please to study▪ in the new College at Oxford, built by the same noble Bene∣factor, of which I shall speak in its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>The Clergy here live at large, and ve¦ry handsomely, in the Close belonging to the Cathedral; where, besides the Bi¦shop's Palace, mention'd above, are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Houses, and very handsomely built for the Prebendaries, Canons, and othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dignitaries of this Church. The Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is a very pleasant Dwelling, the Garden very larg, and the River running that them, but the Floods in Winter some times incommode the Gardens very much.</P>
<P>This School has fully answer'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Founder, who, tho' he was no grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Among the many private Inscriptions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Church, we found one made by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Over, once an eminent Physician in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is City, on a Mother and Child who, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing his Patients, died together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere bury'd in the same Grave, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich intimate, that one died of a Fever, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the other of a Dropsy.</P>

<P>As the City it self stands in a Vale on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Bank, and at the Conju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mall Rivers, so the Country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ising every Way, but just as the Course of the Wa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er keeps the Valley open, you m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essarily, as you go out of the Gates, go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p Hill every Way: But when on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e as∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended, you come to the most charming Plains, and most pleasant Country of that kind in England; which continues, with very small Intersections of Rivers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Valleys, for above fifty Miles, as shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppear in the sequel of this Journey.</P>
<P>At the West-Gate of this City was an∣tiently a Castle, known to be so by the Ruins, more than by an extraordinary Notice taken of it in History: What they say of it, that the Saxon Kings kept their Court here, is doubtful, and must be meant of the West Saxons only; and as to the Tale of King Arthur's round <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, which, they prerend, was kept here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or him, and his two Dozen of Knights; which Table hangs up still, as a Piece of Antiquity, to the Tune of 1200 Years, and has, as they pretend, the Names of the said Knights in Saxon Characters, and yet such as no Man can read. All this Story I see so little Ground to give the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east Credit to, that I look upon it, and't shall please you, to be no better than a Fib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>Where this Castle stood, or whateve else it was, for some say there was no Castle there, the late King Charles II. mark'd out, a very noble Design; which had he liv'd, would certainly have made that Part of the Country, the New Mar∣ket of the Ages to come; for the Coun∣try hereabout far excels that of New-Market Heath, for all kinds of Sport and Diversion, fit for a Prince, no Body can dispute; and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Design included, a noble Palac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sufficient like Windsor, for a Summer Residence of the whole Court, it would certainly have diverted the King from his Cursory Journeys to New-Mar∣ket.</P>
<P>The Plan of this House has receiv'd several Alterations; and as it is never like to be finish d, 'tis scarce worth recording the Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iety: The Building is begun, and the Front next the City carry'd up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but the remainder is not begun: There was a Street of Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> from the Gate of the Palace <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Town, but it was n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Park mark: out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> large ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ten Miles in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and ended West upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Downs, in view of the Town of Stockbridge.</P>
<P>This House was afterwards settled with a Royal Revenue also, as an Ap∣penage, establish'd by Parliament upon Prince <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge of Denmark for his Life, in case he had out-liv'd the Queen: But his Royal Highness dying before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Ma∣jesty, all hope of seein this Design per∣fected, or the House finish'd, is now va∣nish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</P>
<P>I cannot omit that the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are several publick Edifices in this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, and in the Neighbour hood; as the Hospitals, and the Building adjoining near the East G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te; and towards the North, a Piece of an old Monastry undemolish'd, and which is still preserv'd to the Religion, being the Residence of some private Roman Ca∣tholick Gentlemen, where they have an Oratory, and, as they say, live still ac∣cording to the Rule of St. Benedict. This Building is call'd Hide House; and, as they live very usefully and, to the highest

Degree, obliging among their Neigh∣bours, they meet with no Obstruction or Disturbance from any Body.</P>
<P>Winchester is a Place of no Trade, o∣ther than is naturally occasion'd by the Inhabitants of the City and neighbouring Villages, one with another: Here is no Manufacture, no Navigation; there was indeed an Attempt to make the River navigable from Southampton, and it was once made practicable; but it never answered the Expence, so as to give Encouragement to the Undertakers.</P>
<P>Here is a great deal of good Compa∣ny; and abundance of Gentry being in the Neighbourhood, it adds to the sociable∣ness of the Place: The Clergy also here are, generally speaking very rich, and very numerous.</P>
<P>As there is such good Company, so they are gotten into that new-fashion'd Way of conversing by Assemblies: I shall do no more than mention them here; they are pleasant and agreeable to the young People, and some times fatal to them, of which, in its Place; Win∣chester has its Share of the Mirth: May it escape the ill Consequences.</P>
<P>The Hospital on the South of this City, at a Miles distance on the Road to Southampton, is worth Notice: 'Tis said to be founded by King William Ru∣fus, but was not endow'd or appointed till later Times by Cardinal Beaufort. Every Traveller that knocks at the Door of this House, in his Way, and asks for it, claims the Relief of a piece of white Bread and a cup of Beer; and this Do∣nation is still continued; a Quantity of good Beer is set apart every Day to be given away; and what is left, is distri∣buted to other Poor, but none of it kept to the next Day.</P>
<P>How the Revenues of this Hospital, which should maintain the Master and thirty private Gentlemen, who they call Fellows, but ou ht to call Brothers, is now reduc'd to maintain only fourteen, while the Master lives in a Figure equal to the best Gentleman in the Country, would be well worth the Enquiry of a proper Visitor, if such can be nam'd: 'Tis a Thing worthy of Complaint, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> publick Charities, design'd for the Relie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Poor, are embezzel'd and depre¦dated by the rich, and turn'd to the Support of Luxury and Pride.</P>
<P>From Winchester, is about 25 Miles and over the most charming Plains that can any where be seen, (far in my Opi∣nion) excelling the Plains of Mecca, we come to Salisbury; the vast Flocks of Sheep, which one every where sees up▪upon these Downs, and the great Num∣ber of those Flocks, is a Sight truly worth Observation; 'tis ordinary for these Flocks to contain from 3 to 5000 in a Flock; and several private Farmers hereabouts have two or three such Flocks.</P>
<P>But 'tis most remarkable still; how a great part of these Downs comes by a new Method of Husbandry, to be not only made Arable, which they never were in former days, but to bear excellent Wheat, and great Crops tho' otherwise poor barren Land, and never known to our Ancestors to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e capable of any such Thing; nay, they would perhaps have laugh'd at any one that would have gone about to plough up the wild Downs and Hills, where the Sheep were wont to go: But Experience has made the prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Age wi∣ser, and more skilful in Husbandry; for by only folding the Sheep upon the plow'd Lands, those Lands, wh ch otherwise are barren, and where the Plow goes within three or four Inches of the solid Rock of Chalk, are made fruitful, and bear very good Wheat, as well as Rye and Barley: I shall say more of this when I come to speak of the same Practice farther in the Country.</P>
<P>This plain Country conti ues in length from Winchester to Salisbury 25 Miles, from thence to Dorchester 22 Miles, thence to Weymouth 6 Miles, so that they lie near 50 Miles in leng h, and breadth; they r ach also in some Places 35 to 40 Miles: They who would make any prac∣ticable Guess at the Number of Sheep usually fed on these Downs, may take it from a Calculation made, as I was told, at Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chester, that there were 600000 Sheep fed within six Miles of that Town,
<PB REF="119"/>
measuring every Way round, and the Town in the Center.</P>
<P>As we pass'd this plain Country, we say a great many old Camps, as well Roman as British, and several Remains of the ancient Inhabitants of this King∣dom, and of their Wars, Battles, En∣trenchments, Encampments, which are indeed very agreeable to a Traveller, that has read any thing of the History of the Country. Old Sarum is as re∣markable as any of these, where there is a double Entrenchment, with a deep Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, or Ditch, to either of them; the Area about 100 Yards in Diameter, tak∣ing in the whole Crown of the Hill, and thereby rendering the Ascent very difficult: Near this, there is one Farm House, which is all the Remains I could see of any Town in or near the Place, for the Encampment has no Resemblance of a Town; and yet this is call'd the Borough of old Sarum, and sends two Members to Parliament, who, those Members can justly say, they represent, would be hard for them to answer.</P>
<P>Some will have it, that the old City of Sorbiodunum, or Salisbury, stood here, and was afterwards, for I know not what Reasons, remov'd to the low marshy Grounds, among the Rivers, where at now stands: But as I sec no Authority for it, other than mere Tradition. I be∣lieve my Share of it, and take it ad re∣ferendum.</P>
<P>Salisbury itself is indeed a large and pleasant City; tho' I do not think it all the pleasanter for that which they boast so much of; namely, the Water running th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o' the middle of every Street, or that it adds any thing to the Beauty of the Place, but just the contrary; it keeps the Streets always dirty, full of Wet and Filth, and Weeds, even in the middle of Summer.</P>
<P>The City is plac'd upon the Conflu∣ence of two large Rivers, the Avon and the Willy, either of them considerable Rivers, but very large, when joyn'd to∣gether, and yet larger when they receive a third River▪ viz the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Claren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Park, about three Miles below the City; then, with a deep Channel, and a Current less rap∣pid, they run down to Christ Church, which is their Port, and where they empty themselves into the Sea from that Town upwards, towards Salisbury, they are made navigable too within two Miles, and might be so quite into the City, where it not for the Strength of the Stream.</P>
<P>As the City of Winchester is a City without Trade, that is to say, without any particular Manufactures; so this Ci∣ty of Salisbury, and all the County of Wilts, of which it is the Capital, are full of great Variety of Manufactures; and those some of the most consider∣able in England; namely, the Clo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th∣ing Trade, and the Trade of Flan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els, Druggets, and several other sorts of Ma∣nufactures, of which in their Order.</P>
<P>The City of Salisbury has two re∣markable Manufactures carried on in it, and which employ the Poor of great Part of the Country round: namely, fine Flan∣nels, and long Cloths for the Turkey Trade, call'd Salisbury Whites: The People of Salisbury are gay and rich, and have a flourishing Trade; and there is a great deal of good Manners and good Company among them; I mean, among the Citizens, besides what is found among the Gentlemen; for there are many good Families in Salisbury, besides the Citi∣zens.</P>
<P>This Society has a great Addition from the Closs▪ that is to say, the Circle of Ground wall'd in adjacent to the Cathe∣dral; in which the Families of the Pre∣bendaries and Commons, and others of the Clergy belonging to the Cathedral have their Houses, as is usual in all Ci∣ties where there are Cathedral Churches. These are so considerable here, and the Place so large, that it is (as it is call'd in general) like another City</P>
<P>The Cathedral is famous for the height of its Spire, which is without Exception the highest and the handsomest in Eng∣land, being from the Ground 410 Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and yet the Walls so exceeding Thin, that at t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e upper Part of the Spire up∣on

a View made by the late Sir Christo∣pher Wren, the Wall was found to be less than five Inches thick; upon which a Con∣sultation was had, whether Spire, or at least the upper Part of it should be taken down, it beyond being supposed to have received some Damage by the great Storm in the Year 1703; but it was resolved in the Negative, and Sir Christopher order'd it to be so strengthen'd with B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds of of Iron Plates, as has effectually secured it; and I have heard some of the best Ar∣chitects say, it is stronger now than when it was first built.</P>
<P>They tell us here long Stories of the great Art used in laying the first Founda∣tion of this Church; the Ground being marshy and wet, occasioned by the Chan∣nels of the Rivers; that it was laid upon piles occording to some, and upon Wool∣packs according to others; but this is not supposed by those who know, that the whole Country is one Rock of Chalk, even from the Tops of the highest Hills to the Bottom of the deepest Rivers.</P>
<P>They tell us, this Church was forty Years a building, and cost an immense Sum of Money, but it must be acknow∣ledged that the inside of the Work is not answerable in the Decoration of Things, to the Workmanship without; the Paint∣ing in the Choir is mean, and more like the ordinary Method of common Drawing Room, or Tavern painting, than that of a Church; the Carving is good, but very little of it, and it is rather a fine Church than finely set off.#</P>
<P>The ordinary Boast of this Building, that there were as many Gates as Months, as many Windows as Days, as many m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ble Pillars as H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs in the Year, is now no Recommendation at all. However the menti n of it must be preserved.</P>
<LG>
<L>As many Days as in One Year there be,</L>
<L>So many Windows in One Church we see;</L>
<L>As many Marble Pillars there appear,</L>
<L>As there are Hours throughout the fleet-Year;</L>
<L>As many Gates as Moons one Year do View:</L>
<L>Strange Tale to tell, yet not mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> strange than true.</L>
</LG>
<P>There are however some very fine Monuments in this Church; particularly one belonging to the Noble Family of Seymours, since Dukes of Somerset, (and Ancestors of the present flourishing Fa∣mily,) which on a most melancholly Oc∣casion has been now lately open'd again to receive the Body of the late Dutchess of Somerset, the happy Consort for almost 40 Years of his Grace the present Duke; and only Daughter and Heiress of the antient and Noble Family of Piercy, Earls of Northumberland, whose great Estate she brought into the Family of Somerset, who now enjoy it.</P>
<P>With her was bury'd at the same time her Graces Daughter the Marchioness of Caermarthen, being married to the Mar∣quis of Caermarthen, Son and Heir ap∣parent to the Lord of Leeds, who dy'd for Grief at the loss of the Dutchess her Mother, and was buried with her; also her second Son the Duke Pier<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Somer∣set, who died a few Months before, and had been buried in the Abbey Church of Westminster, but was order'd to be re∣mov'd and laid here with the Ancestors of his House; and I hear his Grace de∣signs to have a yet more magnificent Monument erected in this Cathedral for them, just by the other, which is there already.</P>
<P>How the Dukes of Somerset c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to quit this Church for thir bur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Place, and be laid in Westminster-Abbey, that I know not; but 'tis certain that the present Duke has chosen to have his Family <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d here with their Ancestors, and to that End has caused the Corpse of his Son the Lord P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercy, as above, and one of his Daughters who had been buried in the Ab∣bey, to be remov'd and brought down to this Vault, which lies in that they call the Virgin Mary's Chappel behind the Altar. There is, as above, a noble Mo∣nument for a late Duke and Dutchess of Somerset in the Place already; with their Pourtraits at full Length, their Heads lying upon Cushions, the whole
<PB N="119" REF="123"/>
perfectly well wrought in fine polish'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Marble, and their Sons kneeling by them; those I suppose to be the Fa∣ther of the Great Duke of Somerset, U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cle to King Edward IV. but after this the Family lay in Westminster-Abbey, where there is also a fine Monument for that very Duke who was beheaded by Edward VI. and who was the great Patron of the Reformation.</P>
<P>Among other Monuments of Noble Men in this Cathedral they show you one that is very extraordinary, and to which there hangs a Tale: There was in the Reign of Philip and Mary a very unhappy Murder committed by the then Lord Sturton, or Stourton, a Family since Extinct, but well known till within a few Years in that Country.</P>
<P>This Lord Stourton being guilty of the said Murder, which also was aggravated with very bad Circumstances, could not obtain the usual Grace of the Crown, viz to be beheaded, but Queen Mary positively ordered that like a common Malefactor he should die at the Gallows: After he was hang'd his Friends desiring to have hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bury'd at Salisbury, the Bi∣shop would not Consent that he should be buried in the Cathedral▪ unless as a farther Mark of Infamy, his Friends would submit to this Condition, viz. That the silken Halter in which he was hang'd should be hanged up over his Grave in the Church, as a Monument of his Crime; which was accordingly done, and there it is to be seen to this Day.</P>
<P>The putting this Halter up here, was not so wonderful to me as it was, that the Posterity of that Lord, who remain'd in good Rank sometime after, should never prevail to have that Mark of Infamy taken off from the Memory of their An∣cestor.</P>
<P>There are several other Monuments in this Cathedral, as particularly of two No∣blemen of antient Families in Scot∣land, one of the Name of Hay, and one of the Name of Gordon; but they give us nothing of their History, so that we must be content to say there they lie, and that's all.</P>
<P>The Cloyster, and the Chapter-House adjoining to the Church, are the finest here of any I have seen in England; the latter is Octogon, or Eight Square, and is 250 Foot in its Circumference; the Roof bearing ll upon one small Marble Pillar in the Center, which you may shake with your Hand; and it is hardly to be imagin'd it can be any great Sup∣port to the Roof, which makes it the more curious it is not indeed to be match'd I believe in Europe.</P>
<P>From hence directing my Course to the Sea side in Purs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of my first Design, viz. of viewing the whole Coast of England. I left the great Road, and went down the East side of the River towards New For∣rest, and Lymington; and he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e I saw the ancient House and Seat of Clarendon the Mansion of the ancient of Hide, An∣cestors of the great Earl of Clarendon, and from whence his Lordship was hon∣our'd with that Title, or the House erected into an Honour in favour of his Family.</P>
<P>But this being a large County, and full of memorable Branches of Antiquity, and modern Curiosity, <HI>I</HI> cannot quit my Ob∣servations so soon, but being happily fix'd by the Favour of a particular Friend at so beautiful a Spot of Ground as this of Clarendon Park I made several little Excursions from hence to view the Nor∣thern Parts of this County; a County so fruitful of Wonders, that tho' I do not make Antiquity my chief Search, yet I must not pass it over inti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely▪ where so much of it, and so well worth Observa∣tion is to be found, which would look as if I either understood not the value of the Study, or expected my Readers should be satisfy'd with a total Omission of it.</P>
<P>I have mention'd that this County is generally a vast continu'd Body of high Chalky Hills, whose Tops spread them∣selves into fruitful and pleasant Downs and Plains, upon which great Flo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks of Sheep are fed, &amp;c. But the Reader is desir'd to observe these Hills and Plains are most beautifully Intersected, and cut thro' by the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of divers pleasant
<PB REF="124" MS="y"/>
and profitable Rivers; in the Course, and near the Banks, of which there always is a Chain of fruitful Meadows, and rich Pastures, and those interspers'd with in∣numerable pleasant Towns, Villages, and Houses, and among them many of con∣siderable Magnitude; so that while you view the Downs, and think the Country wild and uninhabited; yet when you come to descend into these Vales you are surpris'd with the most pleasant and fer∣tile Country in England.</P>
<P>There are no less than four of these Rivers which meet all together, at, or near the City of Salisbury, especially the Waters of thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of them run thro' the Streets of the City; the Nadder and the Willy. and the Avon, and the Course of these three lead us thro' the whole Mountainous Part of the County, the two first joyn their Waters a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wilton; the Shire-Town, tho' a Place of no great Notice now; and these are the Waters which run thro' the Canal, and the Gar∣dens of Wilton-House, the Seat of that Ornament of Nobility, and Learning the Earl of Pembroke.</P>
<P>One cannot be said to have seen any thing that a Man of Curiosity would think worth seeing in this County, and not have been at Wilton House; but not the beautiful Building not the antient Trophy of a great Family, not the noble Scituation, not all the Pleasures of the Gardens, Parks, Fountains, Hare-War∣ren, or of whatever is Rare; either in Art or Nature are equal to, that yet more glorious Sight, of a noble Princely Palace, constantly filled with its noble and proper Inhabitants; viz. the Lord and Proprietor, who is indeed a true Pa∣triarchal Monarch, reigns here with an Authority agreeable to all his Subjects (Family); and his reign is made agree∣able, by his first practising the most ex∣quisite Government of himself, and then guiding all under him by the Rules of Honour and Vertue; being also h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>self perfectly Master of all the needful Arts of Family Government; I mean needful to make that Government, both Easy, and Pleasant to those who are under it, and who therefore willingly, and by Choice conform to it.</P>
<P>Here an exhaulted Genius is the In∣structor, a glorious Example the Guide, and a Gentle well directed Hand the Governour and Law giver to the whole; and the Family like a well govern'd City appears Happy, Flourishing and Regular, groaning under no Grievance, pleas'd with what they Enjoy, and Enjoying every Thing which they ought to be pleas'd with.</P>
<P>Nor is the blessing of this noble Re∣sident extended to the Family only, but even to all the Country round, who in their Degree feel the Effects of the ge∣neral Beneficence; and where the Neigh∣bourhood, however Poor receive all the good they can Expect, and are sure to have no Injury, or Oppression.</P>
<P>The Canal before the House lyes Pa∣rallel with the Road, and receives into it the whole River Willey, or at least is able to do so; it may indeed be said that the River is made into a Canal; when we come into the Court-Yards be∣fore the House there are several peice, of Antiquity to entertain the curious; as particularly, a noble Column of Porphy∣ry, with a Marble State of Venus on the Top of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. In Italy, and especially at Rome and Naples, we see a great Va∣riety of fine Columns, and some of them of excellent Workmanship, and Antiqui∣ty, and at some of the Courts of the Princes of Italy the like is seen; as espe∣cially at the Court of Florence; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England I do not remember to have seen any thing like this, which as they told me is Two and Thirty Foot high, and of excellent Workmanship, and that it came last from Candia, but formerly from Alexandri, what may belong to the History of it any further, I suppose is not known, at least they could tell me no more of it, who shew'd it me.</P>
<P>On the left of the Court was former∣ly a large Grotto, and curious Water-Works, and in a House, or Shed, or Part of the Building, which open'd with two Doors like a Coach-house, a large E∣questrian Statue of one of the Ancestors
<PB REF="125" MS="y"/>
of one of the Ancestors of the Family in compleat Armour, as also another of a Roman Emperor in Brass, but the last time I had the Curiosity to see this House, I mist that Part; so that I suppos'd they were remov'd.</P>
<P>As the present Earl of Pembroke, the Lord of this fine Palace, is a Nobleman of great Personal Merit, many other Ways; so he is a Man of Learning, and Reading, beyond most Men of his Lord∣ship's high Rank in this Nation, if not in the World; and as his Reading has made him a Master of Antiquity and Judge of such peices of Antiquity, as he has had Opportunity to meet with in his own Travels, and otherwise in the World; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o it has given him a love of the Study, and made him a Collector of valuable Things, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Painting as in Sculp∣ture, and other Excellencies of Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ as also of Nature; in so much that Wil-on-House is now a meer Musoeum, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r a Chamber of Raritres, and we meet with several Things there which are to be found no were else in the World</P>
<P>As his Lordship is a great Collector of fine Paintings, so I know no Nobleman's House in England, so prepar'd, as if built on purpose to receive them, the largest and the finest Peices that can be imagin'd extant in the World, might have found a Place here capable to receive them, I say, they might have found▪ as if they could not now, which is in part true; for at present the whole House is so compleat∣ly fill'd, that I see no room for any new peice to crowd in, without Displacing some other fine Peice that hung there be∣fore; as for the value of the Peice, that might so offer to succeed the Displac'd, that the great Judge of the whole Col∣lection, the Earl himself must Determine, and as his Judgment is perfectly good. the best Picture would be sure to possess the Place. In a Word. Here is without doubt the best, if nor the greatest Col∣lection of Rarities, and Paintings that are to be seen together, in any one Noble∣man's, or Gentleman's House in England. The peice of our Saviour washing his Disciple Feet, which they shew you in one of the first Rooms you go into, must be spoken of by every body that has any Knowledge of Painting, and is an ad∣mirable peice indeed.</P>
<P>You ascend the great Stair Case, at the Upper End of the Hall, which is very Large▪ at the Foot of the Stair-case you have a Bacchus large as the Life, done with fine Peloponesian Marble; carrying a young Bacchus on his Arm, the young one eating Grapes, and letting you see by his Countenance, that he is pleas'd with the Tast of them▪ nothing can be done finer, or more lively Represent the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing intended; namely, the Gust of the Ap∣petite, which if i be nor a Passion, '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is an Affection, which is as much seen in the Countenance, perhaps more than any other. One ought to stop every two Steps of this Stair case as we go up to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on∣template the vast Varie <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Pictures, that Cover the Walls, and of s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of the best Masters in Europe, and yet this is but an Introduction to what is beyond them.</P>
<P>When you are enter'd the Appart∣ments, such Variety seizes you every way that you scarse know to which hand to turn your elf First, on one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> you see several Rooms <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill'd with Paintings, as before, all so curious, and the Va iety such, that 'tis with Reluctance, that you can turn from them: while looking ano∣ther way, you are call'd off by a vast Collection of Busto's, and Peices of the greatest Antiquity of the Kind both Greek, and Romans; among these, there is one of the Roman Empe or, Marcus Aurelius in Basso Relievo▪ I never saw any thing like what Appears here ex∣cept in the Chamber of Rarieties a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mun∣ick in Bavaria.</P>
<P>Passing these, you come into several large Rooms, as if contriv'd for the Re∣ception of the beautiful Guess that take them up; one of these is near 70 Foot long and the Ceiling 26 Foot high, with another adjoyning of the same Height, and Breadth, but not so long. Those to∣gether might be call'd the Great Cal∣lery of Wilton, and might vie for Paint∣ings
<PB REF="126" MS="y"/>
with the Gallery of Luxemburg in the Fauxbourg of Paris.</P>
<P>These two Rooms are fill'd with the Family Peices of the House of Herbet, most of them by Lilly, or Vandyke, and one in particularly, out does all that ever I met with, either at Home, or Abroad, 'tis done, as was the Mode of Painting at that Time, after the Manner of a Fa∣mily Peice of King Charles I. with his Queen, and Children, which before the burning of White-Hall, I remember to hang at the East-end of the Long Gal∣lery in the Palace.</P>
<P>This Peice fills the farther End of the Great Room which I just now mention∣ed, it contains the Earl of Montgomery, Ancestor of the House of Herbert, not then Earls of Pembroke, and his Lady, fitting, and as big as the Life; there are about them, their own five Sons, and one Daughter, and their Daughter-in-Law, who was Daughter of the Duke of Buckingham, marry'd to the elder Lord Herbert, their eldest Son; it is enough to say of this Peice, 'tis worth the La∣bour of any lover of Art to to 500 Miles to see it; and I am inform'd several Gen∣tlemen of Quality have come from France almost on purpose; It would be Endless to describe the whole Set of the Family Pictures, which take up this Room, un∣less we would enter into the Roof-tree of the Family, and set down a Genealogical Line of the whole House.</P>
<P>After we have seen this fine range of Beauties, for such indeed they are; far from being at an End of your Surprize, you have three or four Rooms still upon the fame Floor, fill'd with Wonders, as before: Nothing can be finer than the Pictures themselves, nothing more Sur∣prising than the Number of them; at length you Descend the Back-Stairs, which are in themselves large, tho' not like the other: However, not a Hands Breadth is left to crowd a Picture in of the smal∣lest Size, and even the Upper Rooms, which might be call'd Garrets, are not naked, but have some very good Peices in them.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Genius of the noble Collector may be seen in this glo∣rious Collection, than which, take them together, there is not a finer in any pri∣vate Hand in Europe, and in no Hand at all in Britain, Private or Publick.</P>
<P>The Gardens are on the South of the House, and extend themselve beyond the River, a Branch of which runs thro' one Part of them, and still South of the Gardens in the Great Park, which ex∣tending beyond the Vale, Mounts the Hill opening at the last to the Great Down, which is properly call'd by way of Distinction, Salisbury-Plain, and leads from the City of Salisbury, to Shaftsbu∣ry; here also his Lordship has a Hare-Warren (as 'tis call'd) tho' improperly; it has indeed been a Sanctury for the Hares for many Years; but the Gentle∣men complain that it marrs their Game, for that as soon as they put up a Hare for their Sport, if it be any where with∣in two or three Miles, away she runs for the Warren, and there is an End of their Pursuit; on the other Hand, it makes all the Countrymen turn Poachers, and destroy the Hares, by what means they can; but this is a smaller Matter, and of no great Import one way or o∣ther.</P>
<P>From this Pleasant and agreeable Days work, I return'd to Clarendon, and the next Day took another short Tour to the Hills, to see that celebrated peice of An∣tiquity, the wonderful Stone-Henge, be∣ing six Miles from Salisbury, North, and and upon the Side of the River Avon, near the Town of Amesbury: 'Tis need∣less, that I should enter here into any part of the Dispute about, which our learned Antiquaries have so puzzl'd them∣selves, that several Books, and one of them, in Folio, has been yublish'd about it; some alleding it to be a Heathen, or Pagan Temple, and Altar, or Place of Sacrifice, as Mr. Jones; others, a Monu∣ment or Trophy of Victory; others a Monument for the Dead, as Mr. Aubury, and the like: Again, some will have it be British, some Danish, some Saxon, some Roman, and some before them all, Phenician.</P>
<P><PB REF="127" MS="y"/>
I shall suppose it, as the Majority of all Writers do, to be a Monument for the Dead, and the rather, because Mens Bones have been frequently dug up in the Ground near them. The common Opinion that no Man could ever count them, that a Baker carry'd a Basket of Bread, and laid a Loaf upon every Stone, and yet could never make out the same Number twice. This I take, as a meer Country Fiction, and a Ridiculous one too; the Reason why they cannot easily <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> told, is that many of them lie half, or part buried in the Ground, and a peice here, and a piece there, only appearing above the Grass, it cannot be known ea∣sily, which belong to one Stone, and which to another, or which are separate Stones, and which are joined under Ground to another; otherwise, as to those which appear, they are easie to be told, and I have seen them told four Times af∣ter one another, beginning every Time at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> different Place, and every Time they amounted in 72 in all; but then this was counting every piece of a Stone of bulk, which appear'd at above the Surface of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Earth, and was not evidently part of, and adjoining to another, to be a distinct and separate Body, or Stone by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t self.</P>
<P>The form of this Monument is not only describ'd but delineated in most Au∣thors, and indeed 'tis hard to know the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst, but by the last; the Figure was at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Circular, and there were at least our Rows or Circles, within one another; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e main Stones were placed upright, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd they were join'd on the Top by Cross <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tones, laid from one to another, and astn'd with vast Mortices and Tenants: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength of time has so decay'd them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at not only most of the cross Stones which lay on the Top are fallen down, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut many of the Upright also, notwith∣standing the weight of them is so prodi¦<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious great: How they came thither, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om whence, no Stones of that Kind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing now to be found in any Part of Eng∣nd near it, is still the Mistery, for they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of such immense Bulk that no Engines, or Carriages which we have in use in this Age could stir them.</P>
<P>Doubtless they had some Method in former Days in foreign Counties, as well as here, to move heavier Weights then we find practicable now: How else did Solomon's Workmen build the Battlement or additional Wall to Support the Preci∣peice of Mount Moriah, on which the Temple was built? which was all built of great Stones of Parian Marble, each Stone being forty Cubits long, and four∣teen Cubits broad, and eight Cubits high, or thick, which reckoning each Cubit at two Foot and a half of our Measure, as the Learned agree to do, was 100 Foot long, 35 Foot broad, and 20 Foot thick.</P>
<P>These Stones at Stonehenge, as Mr. Cambden describes them, and in which others agree, were very large, tho' not so large, the upright Stones 24 Foot high, 7 Foot broad; 16 Foot round, and weight 12 Ton each; and the cross Stone on the Top, which he calls Coronets, were 6 or 7 Ton, but this does not seem equal, for if the cross Stones weigh'd six, or seven Ton, the others, as they appear now, were at 5 or 6 Times as big, and must in proportion; and therefore, I must think their Judgment much nearer the Case who judge the upright Stones at 16 Ton, or thereabouts, supposing them to stand a great way into the Earth, as 'tis not doubted but they do; and the Coronets, or cross Stones, at about two Ton, which is very large too, and as much as their Bulk can be thought to allow.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, we must take them as our Ancestors have done; Namely, for an Erection, or Building so antient, that no History has handed down to us the Original, as we find it then uncertain, we must leave it so: 'Tis indeed a Reve∣rend peice of Antiquity, and 'tis a great loss that the true History of it is not known; But since it is not, I think the making so many Conjectures at the Reali∣ty, when they know none can but guess at it, and above all the insisting so long, and warmly on their private Opinions, is
<PB REF="128" MS="y"/>
amusing themselves and us with a Doubt, which perhaps lies the deeper for their Search into it,</P>
<P>The Downs and Plains in this part of England being so open, and the Surface so little Subject to Alteration, there are more Remains of Antiquity to be seen upon them, than in other Places; for Ex∣ample, I think they tell us there are three and fifty ancient Encampments, or For∣tifications to be seen in this one County, some whereof are exceeding plain to be seen, some of one form, some of another; some of one Nation, some of another, British, Danish, Saxon, Roman, as at Ebb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>down, Burywood, Oldburgh Hill, Cummerford, Roundway Down, St. Ann's Hill, Bratton Castle, Clay Hill, Stourn∣ton Park, Whitecole Hill, Battlebury, Scrathbury, Yanesbury, Frippsbury, Suth∣bury Hill, Amesbury, Great Bodwyn, Easterley, Merdon, Aubery, Martenscil Hill, Barbury Castle, and many more.</P>
<P>Also the Barrows▪ as we all agree to call them, are very many in Number in this County, and very obvious, ha∣ving suffer'd very little Decay, these are large Hillocks of Earth cast up▪ as the antients agree, by the Soldiers over the Bodies of their dead Comrades slain in Battle; several Hundreds of these are to be seen, especially in the North part of this County, about Marlbro' and the Downs, from thence to St. Ann's Hill, and even every way, the Downs are full of them.</P>
<P>I have done with Matters of Antiqui∣ty for this County, unless you will ad∣mit me to mention the famous Parlia∣ment in the Reign of Henry II. held at Clarendon, where I am now writing, and another intended to be held there in Richard the 2d's Time, but prevented by the Barons, being then up in Arms against the King.</P>
<P>Near this Place at Farlo was the Birth-place of the late Sir Stephen Fox, and where the Town sharing in his good Fortune, shews several Marks of his Bounty, as particularly, the Building a new Church from the Foundation, and getting an Act of Parliament past, for making it Parochial, it being but a Chappel of Ease before to an adjoin∣ing Parish: Also Sir Stephen Built and Endow'd an Alms-House here for six poor Women, with a Master and a Free-School; the Master is to be a Clergy∣man, and to officiate in the Church, that is to say, is to have the Living, which including the School is very suf∣ficient.</P>
<P>I am now to pursue my first Design, and shall take the West part of Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in my Return, where are several Things still to be taken notice of, and some very well worth ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stay. In the mean time I went on to Langbro' a fine Seat of my Lord Colerain, which is very well kept, tho' the Family it seems is not much in this Country, having another Estate, and Dwelling at Tottenham High-Cross near London.</P>
<P>From hence I my way to the Sea side I came to New Forest, of which I have said something already with Relation to the great Extent of Ground, which lies Wast, and in which there is so a great a Quantity of large Timber, as I have spo∣ken of already.</P>
<P>This wast and wild Part of the Coun∣try was, as some Record, lay'd open, and wast for a Forest, and for Game, by that violent Tyrant William the Conqueror, and for which purpose he unpeopled the Country, pull'd down the Houses, and which was worse, the Churche▪ of se∣veral Parishes or Towns, and of abun∣dance of Villages, turning the poor Peo∣ple out of their Habitations, and Pos∣sessions. and laying all open for his Deer: The same Histories likewise Re∣cord that two of his Blood and Posterity, and particularly his immediate Successor William Rusus lost their Lives in this Forest One (viz.) the said, William Rusus being shot with an Arrow directed at a Deer, which the King, and his Com∣pany were Hunting, and the Arrow glancing on a Tree, chang'd his Course and struck the King full on the Breast, and kill'd him: This they relate as a just Judgment of God on the cruel Devasta∣tion made here by the Conqueror: Be
<PB REF="129" MS="y"/>
it so or not, as Heaven pleases; butt that the King was so kill'd, is certain, and they show the Tree, on which the Ar∣row glanc'd to this Day; in King Chrles II. Time, it was ordered to be surround∣ed with a Pale, but as great part of the Paleing is down with Age; whether the Tree be really so old, or not, is to me a great Question; the Action being near 700 Year ago.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to mention here a Pro∣posal made a few Years ago to the late Lord Treasurer, Godolphin, for Re peop∣ling this Forest, which for some Reasons I can be more particular in, than any Man now left alive, because I had the Honour to Draw up the Scheme, and ar∣gue it before that Noble Lord, and some others who were principally concern'd at that time in bringing Over, or rather providing for when they were come Over, the poor Inhabitants of the P la∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inate; a Thing in itself Commendable, but as it was managed, made Scandalous to England, and Miserable to those poor People.</P>
<P>Some Persons being ordered by that Noble Lord, above mention'd, to consider of Measures, how the said poor People should be Provided for, and whether they could be provided for, or no, without Injury to the Publick. The answer was grounded upon this Maxim, that the Number of Inhabitants is the Wealth and Strength of a Kingdom, provided those Inhabitants were such, as by honest In∣dustry applied themselves to live by their Labour, to whatsoever Trades, or Em∣ployments they were brought up. In the next Place it was inquir'd, what Employments those poor People were brought up to? It was answer'd, there were Husbands, and Artificers of all Sorts, upon which the Proposal was as follows.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>New Forest in Hampshire was signl'd out to be the Place.</HEAD>
<P>Here it was propos'd to draw a great Square-Line, containing four Thounsand Acres of Land, marking out two lage High ways, or Roads thro▪ the Center, crossing both Ways, so that there should be a Thousand Acres in each Division, exclusive of the Land contained in the said cross Roads.</P>
<P>Then it was propos d to single out twenty Men, and their Families, who should be recommended as honest in∣dustrious Men, expert in, or at least ca∣pable of being instructed in Husbandry, curing and cultivating of Land, breed∣ing and feeding Cattle, and the like; to each of these should be parcell'd out in equal Distributions, two Hundred Acres of this Land, so that the whole Four Thousand Acres should be fully distri∣buted to the said Twenty Families, for which they should have no no Rent to pay, and be liable to no Taxes, but such as provided for their own Sick or Poor, repairing their own Roads, and the like: This Exemption from Rent and Taxes, to continue for twenty Years, and then to pay each So l. a Year to the Queen; that is to say, to the Crown.</P>
<P>To each of these Families, who I would now call Farmers, it was proposed to advance 200 l. in ready Money, as a Stock to set them to Work, to furnish them with Cattle, Horses, Cows, Hogs, &amp;c. and to Hire and pay Labourers, to Enclose, Clear, and Cure the Land; which it would be suppos'd the first Year would not be so much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o their Advantage as afterwards; allowing them Timber out of the Forest to build themselves Houses, and Barns, Sheds, and Offices, as they should have Occasion; also for Carts, Waggons, Ploughs, Harrows, and the like necessary Things, Care to be taken, that the Men and their Families, went to work forthwith according to the De∣sign.</P>
<P>Thus twenty Families would be im∣mediately supplyed, and provided for, for there would be no doubt, but these Families with so much Land given them Gratis, and so much Money to work with, would live very well; but what would this do for the Support of the rest?
<PB REF="130" MS="y"/>
who were suppos'd to be to every 20 Farmers, forty or fifty Families of other People; some of one Trade, some of an∣other, with Women and Children? to this it was answer'd, that these twenty Farmers would by the Consequence of their own Settlements, provide for, and employ such a Proportion of others of their own People, That by thus provid∣ing for twenty Families in a Place, the whole Number of Palatinates would have been provided for, had they been 20000 more in Number than they were, and that without being any Burthen upon, or Injury to the People of England; on the centrary, they would have been an Advantage, and an Addition of Wealth and Strength to the Nation, and to the Country in particular where they should be thus Seated: For Example:</P>
<P>As soon as the Land was mark'd out the Farmers put in Possession of it, and the Money given them, they should be oblig'd to go to Work, in order to their Settlement; suppose it then to be in the Spring of the Year, when such Work was most proper; First all hands would be requir'd, to Fence, and Part off the Land, and clear▪ it of the Timber, or Bushes, or what ever else was upon it, which requir'd to be remov'd: The first Thing therefore which the Farmer would do, would be to single out from the rest of their Number, every one three Ser∣vants, that is to say, two Men, and a Maid; less cou'd not answer the Prepa∣rations they would be oblig'd to make, and yet work hard themselves also; by the help of these, they would with good Management soon get so much of their Land Cur'd, Fenc'd oft, Plow'd, and Sow'd, as should yield them a sufficiency of Corn and Kitchin Stuff, the very first Year, both for Horse-meat, Hog-meat, Food for the Family, and some to carry to Market too, by which to bring in Money to go farther on, as above.</P>
<P>At the first Entrance▪ they were to have the Tents allow'd them to live in, which they then had from the Tower; but as soon as Leisure, and Conveniences admitted, every Farmer was oblig'd to begin to Build him a Farm-house, which he would do gradually, some and some, as he could spare Time from his other Works, and Money from his little Stock.</P>
<P>In order to furnish himself with Carts▪ Waggons, Plows, Harrows, Wheel-Bar∣rows, Hurdles, and all such necessary U∣tensils of Husbandry; there would be an absolute Necessity of Wheelwrights, or Cartwrights, one at last to each Di∣vision.</P>
<P>Thus by the Way, there would be Em∣ploy'd three Servants to each Farmer, that makes sixty Persons.</P>
<P>Four Families of Wheelwrights, one to each Division; which, suppose five in a Family, makes 20 Persons; suppose four Head Carpenters, with each three Men, and as at first all would be building toge∣ther, they would to every House build∣ing have at least one Labourer, four Fa∣milies of Carpenters five to each Families of Carpenters, five to each Family, and three Servants, is thirty two Persons, one Labourer to each House building, is twenty Persons more.</P>
<P>Thus here would be Necessarily brought together in the very first of the Work 132 Persons, besides the head Farmers, who at five, also to each Family are #an Hundred more, in all two Hundred Thirty two.</P>
<P>For the necessary Supply of these with Provisions, Cloaths, Houshold Stuff, &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. for all should be done among themselves; first, they must have at least four Butchers with their Families; twenty Persons, four Shoemakers with their Families, and each Shoemaker two Journeymen for every Trade; would Encrease the Num∣ber of Customers to every Trade: This is twenty eight Persons more.</P>
<P>They would then require a Hat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aler▪ a Glover, at least two Ropemakers, four Taylors, three Weavers of Woollen, and three Weavers of Linnen, two Basket∣makers▪ two common Brewers, ten or twelve Shop-keepers to furnish Chand∣lery and Grocery Wares; and as many for Drapery and Mercery, over and a∣bove what they could Work, this makes
<PB REF="131" MS="y"/>
two and forty Families more, each at five in a Family, which is two hundred and ten Persons; all the labouring Part of these must have at least two Servants, the Brewers more, which I cast up at forty more.</P>
<P>Add to these two Ministers, one Clerk, one Sexton, or Grave-digger with their Families, two Physicians, three Apothe∣caries, two Surgeons, less there could not be, only that for the beginning it might be said the Physicians should be Su geons, and I take them so; this is forty five Persons, besides Servants; so that in short, to omit many Tradesmen more who would be wanted among them, there would necessarily, and voluntarily <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollow, to these twenty Families of Far∣mers at least six hundred more of their own People.</P>
<P>It is no difficult thing to shew that the ready Money of 4000 l. which the Go∣vernment was to advance to those twenty Farmers, would Employ and Pay, and consequently Sublist all these numerous Dependants, in the Works which must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everally be done for them, for the first Year; after which the Farmers would begin to receive their own Money back again; for all these Tradesmen must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to their own Market to buy Corn, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesh, Milk, Butter, Cheese, Bacon, &amp;c. which after the first Year the Farmers having no Rent to pay, would have to pare sufficiently, and so take back their own Money with Advantage; I need <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot go on to mention. how by conse∣quence Provisions encreasing, and Money <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irculating, this Town should Encrease in very little Time.</P>
<P>It was Propos'd also that for the En∣couragement of all the Handicrastsmen, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Labouring Poor, who either as Ser∣vants, or as Labourers for Day work, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssisted the Farmers or other Tradesmen, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey should have every Man three Acres <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Ground given them, with leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uild Cottages upon the same, the Al∣lotments to be upon the Waste, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of the Cross Roads where they en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red the Town.</P>
<P>In the Center of the Square was laid out a Circle of twelve Acres of Ground, to be cast into Streets for Inhabitants to build on, as their Ability would permit; all that would Build to have Ground gratis for twenty Years, Timber out of the Forest, and convenient Yards, Gardens and Orchards allotted to every House.</P>
<P>In the Great Streets near where they Cross each other, was to be Built a hand∣some Market-hose, with a Town-Hall for Parish or Corporation Business, doing Justice and the like; also Shambles, and in a handsome Part of the Ground men∣tion'd to be laid out for Streets, as near the Center as might be, was to be Ground laid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut for the building a Church, which every Man should either Contri∣bute to the Building of in Money, or give every tenth Day of his Time to assist in Labouring at the Building.</P>
<P>I have omitted many Tradesmen, who would be wanted here, and would find a good Livel hood among their Coun∣try Folks; only to get accidental Work, as Daymen, or Labourers; of which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Town would constantly Employ many, as also poor Women for Assistance in Families, such as Midwives Nurses, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Adjacent to to the Town was to be a certain Quantity of Common Land, for the Benefit of the Cottages; that the Poor might have a few Sheep, or Cows as their Circumstances requir'd, and this to be appointed at the several Ends of the Town.</P>
<P>There was a Calculation made of what Encrease here would be, both of Wealth and People in twenty Years in this Town, what a vast Consumption of Provisions they would cause, more than the four thousand Acres of Land given them would produce; by which Con∣sumption, and encrease so much Advan∣tage would accrue to the publick Stock, and so many Subjects be added to the many Thousands of Great Britain; who in the next Age would be all True born English-men, and forget both the Lan∣guage, and Nation from whence they
<PB REF="132" MS="y"/>
came; and it was in order to this that two Ministers were appointed, one of which should officiate in English, and the other in High Dutch; and withal to have them oblig'd by a Law to Teach all their Children both to Speak, Read and Write the English Language.</P>
<P>Upon their Encrease they would also want Barbers, and Glasiers, Painters also and Plumbers; a Windmill or two, and the Mille<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and their Families, a Fulling∣mill, and a Cloth-Worker; as also a Master Clothier, or two, for making a Manufacture among them for their own Wear, and for employing the Women and Children; a Dyer or two, for Dy∣ing their Manufactures; and, which a∣bove all, is not to be omitted, four Fa∣milies at least of Smiths with every one two Servants; considering that besides all the Family work, which continually employs a Smith, all the Shoeing of Horses, aa the iron-work of Plows, Carts, Waggons, Harrows, &amp;c. must be wrought by them.</P>
<P>There was no Allowance made for Inns, and Alehouses, seeing it would be frequent that those who kept Publick Houses of any sort would likewise have some other Employment to carry on.</P>
<P>This was the Scheme for settling the Palatinates, by which Means twenty Fa∣milies of Farmers, handsomely set up, supported, would lay a Foundation, as I have said, for six or seven hundred of the rest of their People; and as the Land in New Forest is undoubtedly good, and capable of Improvement by such Cul∣tivation, so other Wastes in England are to be found as fruitful as that; and twenty such Villages might have been erected, the poor Strangers maintained, and the Nation evidently be better'd by it, as to the Money to be advanc'd, which in the Case of twenty such Settle∣ments, at 4000 l. each, would be 80000 l. two Things were answer'd to it</P>
<P N="1">1. That the annual Rent to be receiv'd for all those Lands after twenty Years, would abundantly pay the Publick for the first Disbursses on the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deme above, that Rent being then to amount to 40000 l per Ann.</P>
<P N="2">2. More Money than would have don<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thi, was expended, or r ther thro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> away upon them here, to keep them it susp nse and afterwards star<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them; send∣ing th m a begging all over the Nation and shipping them off to perish in othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countries: Where the Mistake lay, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> none of my Business to enquire.</P>
<P>I reserv'd this Account for this place, because I pass'd in this Journey over the very Spot where the Design was laid out; namely, near Lindhurst, in the Ro d from Rumsey to Lunington, whether I now directed my Course.</P>
<P>Limington is a little, but populous Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Port, standing opposite to the Isle of Wight, in the narrow Part of the Streigh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which Ships sometimes pass thro' in fair Weather, call'd the Needles; and right against an ancient Town of that Island call'd yar∣mouth, and which, in Distinction from the great Town of Yarmouth in Norfolk, is c ll'd South Y rm uth. This Town of Limington is chiefly noted for making fine Salt, which is indeed exceilent good; and from whence all South Parts of Eng∣land are supply'd, as well by Water as by Land Carriage; and sometimes, tho' not often, they se d Salt to London, when contrary Winds having kept the Northern Fleets back, the Price at Lon∣don has been very high; but this is very seldom and uncertain. Limingt n sends two Members to Parliament, and this and her Salt Trade is all I can to her, for tho' she is very well situated, as to the Convenience of Shipping, I do not find they have any Foreign Commerce; except it be what we Smuggling, a d Rogueing; which, I may say, is the reigning Commerce of all this Part of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> English Co st, from the Mouth of the Thames to the Land's End of Com∣wall.</P>
<P>From hence there are but few Towns on the S a Coast West, tho' there are several considerable Rivers empty them∣selves into the Sea, nor are there any Harbours, or Sea Ports o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Note, ex∣cept Pool: As for Christ Church, tho' it

stands at the Mouth of the Avon, which, as I have said, comes down from Salis∣bury, and brings with it all the Waters of the South and East Parts of Wiltshire; and receives also the Stour and Piddle, two Dorsetshire Rivers, which bring with them all the Waters of the North Part of Dorsetshire; yet it is a very in∣considerable poor place, searce worth seeing, and less worth mentioning in this Account; only, that it sends two Members to Parliament, which many Poor Towns in this part of England do, as well as that.</P>
<P>From hence I stept into the Coun∣try North West, to see the ancient Town of Wimburn, or Wimburnmin∣ster: There I found nothing remarkable, but the Church, which is indeed a very great one, ancient, and yet very well built, with a very firm strong square Tower high; but was, without doubt, much finer, when on the Top of it, stood a most exquisite Spire finer and taller, if Fame lies not, than that at Salisbury, and, by its Situation, in a planer, flatter Country, visible, no ques∣tion, much farther: But this most beau∣tiful Ornament was blown down by a sudden Tempest of Wind, as they tell us, in the Year 1622.</P>
<P>The Church remains a venerable Piece of Antiquity, and has in it the Remains of a Place, much more in Re∣quest than it is now; for here are the Monuments of several noble Families; and in particular of one King, viz King Etheldred, who was slain in Battle by the Danes: He was a Prince fam'd for Piety and Religion, and, according to the Zeal of these Times, was esteem'd as a M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tyr; because venturing his Life against the Danes, who were Heathens, he died sighting for his Religion and his Country. The Inscription upon his Grave is preserv'd, and has been care fully repair d, so as to be easily read, and is as follows:</P>
<P>In hoe loco quies<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it Corpus S. Ethel∣dredi, Regis West Saxonum, Marryris, qui Anno Dom▪ DCCCLXXII. xxiii. Aprilis per Manos Danorum Paga no∣rum Occubuit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>In English thus:</HEAD>
<P>Here rests the Body of Holy Ethel∣dred, King of the West Saxons, and Martyr, who fell in by the Hands of the Pagan Danes, in the Year of our Lord 872, the 23d of April.</P>
<P>Here are also the Monuments of the great Marchioness of Exeter, Mother of Edward Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, and last of the Family of Courtneys who enjoy'd that Honour; as also of John de Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and his Wife, Grandmother of K. Henry VII. by her Daughter Margaret Countess of Richmond.</P>
<P>This last Lady I mention because she was Foundress of a very fine Free School, which has since been enlarg'd, and had a new Benefactress in Queen Elizabeth, who has enlarg'd the Stipend, and an∣nex'd it to Foundation: The famous Car∣dinal Pool was Dean of this Church be∣fore his Exaltation.</P>
<P>Having said this of the Church, I have said all that is worth naming of the Town; except that the Inhabitants, who are many, and poor, are chiefly main∣tain'd by the Manufacture of knitting Stockings, which employs great Part indeed of the County of Dorset of which this is the first Town Eastward.</P>
<P>South of this Town, over a Sandy wild and barren Country, we came to Pool, a considerable Sea Port, and indeed the most considerable in all this part of England; for here I found some Ships, some Merchants, and some Trade; es∣pecially, here were a good Number of Ships fitted out every Year to the Newfoundland Fishing, in which the Pool Men were said to have been par∣ticularly successful for many Years past.</P>
<P>The Town si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the Bottom of a great Bay, or Inlet of the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which entring at one narrow Mouth opens <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a very great Shoar of this Town; it runs also West up almost to the Town of War<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham, a little below which it re∣ceives

the Rivers Froom and Piddle, the two principle Rivers of the County.</P>
<P>This Place is famous for the best, and bigest Oysters in all this Part of England, which the People of Pool pretend to be famous for pickling, and they are Bar∣rell'd up here, and sent not only to Lon∣don, but to the West Indies, and to Spain, and Italy, and other Parts 'Tis observ'd more Pearl are found in the Pool Oysters, and larger than in any other Oysters a∣bout England.</P>
<P>As the Entrance into this large Bay is Narrow, so it is made narrower by an Island, call'd Branksey, which lying in the very Mouth of the Passage, divides it into two, and where there is an old Castle, call'd Branksey Castle built to defend the Entrance, and this Strength was very great advantage to the Trade of this Port, in the time of the late War with France.</P>
<P>Wareham is a neat Town, and full of People, having a share of Trade with Fool it self it sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s the Ruins of a large Town, and 'tis apparent has had eight Churches, of which they have three re∣maining.</P>
<P>South of Wareham, and between the Bay I have mention'd and the Sea, lyes a larke Tract of Land, which being sur∣rounded by the Sea, except on one Side is call'd an Island, tho' it is really what should be called a Peninsula; this Tract of Land is better inhabited than the Sea Coast of this West End of Dorsetshire generally is, and the Manufactue of Stock∣ings is cartyed on there also; it is called the Isle of Purbeck, and has in the Mid∣dle of it a large Market-Town, called Corf, and from the famous Castle there. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole Town is now call'd Corf-Castle, it is a Corporation, sending Members to Parliaments.</P>
<P>This part of the Country is eminent for vast Quareys of Stone, which is cut out Flat, and us'd in London in great Quantities for Paving Court-Yards, Al∣leys, Avenues to Houses, Kitchins, Foot∣ways on the Sides of the High Streets, and the like; and is very profitable to the Place, as also in the Numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Shipping employed in bringing it to London. There are also several Rocks of very good Marble, only that the Veins in the Stone are not Black and White, as the Italian, but Grey, Red, and other Colours.</P>
<P>From Hence to Weymouth, which is—Miles we Rod in view of the Sea; the Country is open, and in some respects pleasant, but not like the Northern Parts of the County, which are all fine Carpet Ground, soft as Velvet, and the Herbage, sweet as Garden Herbs, which makes their Sheep be the best in England, if not in the World, and their Wool fine to an extrem.</P>
<P>I cannot omit here a small Adventure, which was very surprizing to me on this Journey; passing this plain Country, we came to an open Peice of Ground where a Neighbouring Gentleman had at a great Expence laid out a proper peice of Land for a Decoy, or Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k-coy, as some call it; the Works were but newly done, the Planting young the Ponds very large, and well made; but the proper Places for shelter of the Fowl not cover'd, the Trees not being grown, and Men were still at work improving, and enlarging, and planting on the adjoyning Heath, or Common. Near the Decoy Keeper's House, were some Places where y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g Decoy-Ducks were hatch'd, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wise kept to fit them for their Work▪ To preserve them from Vermin, Pole∣cats, Kites, and such like; they had set Traps, as is usual in such Cases, and a Gibbet by it, where abundance of such Creatures as were taken were hang d up for show.</P>
<P>While the Decoy Man was busy show∣ing the New works, he was alarm'd with a great Cry about this House for Help, help, and away he run, like the Wind, guessing, as we puppos'd that something was catched in the Trap.</P>
<P>It was a good big Boy about 13 or 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Year old, that cry'd out, for coming to
<PB REF="137" MS="y"/>
the Place, he found a great Fowl catch'd by the Leg in the Trap, which yet was so strong, and so outrageous, that the Boy going too near him, he flew at him, and frighted him, bit him, and beat him with his Wings, for he was too strong for the Boy; as the Master ran from the De∣coy, so another Man-Servant run from the House, and finding a st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ange Crea∣ture fast in the Trap, not knowing what it was, laid at him with a great Stick; the Creature fought him a good while, but at length he struck him an un∣lucky Blow, which quieted him; after this we all came up to see what was the matter, and found a monstruous Eagle caught by the Leg in the Trap, and kill'd by the Fellow's Cudgel, as above.</P>
<P>When the Master came to know what it was, and that his Man had kill'd it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was ready to kill the Fellow for his pains, for it was a noble Creature indeed, and would have been worth a great deal to the Man to have it shown about the Country, or to have sold to any Gentle∣man curious in such Things; but the Eagle was dead, and there we left it; 'Tis probable this Eagle had flown over the Sea from France, either there, or at the Isle of Weight, where the Channel is not so wide; for we do not find that any Eagle are known to breed in those Parts of Britain.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd up to Dorches¦ter, the County Town, tho' not the la gest Town in the County; Dorchester is in∣deed a pleasant agreeable Town to live in, and where I thought the People seem∣ed less divided into Factions and Parties, than in other Places; for though there are Divisions and the People are not all of one Mind, either as to Religion, or Po∣liticks, yet they did not seem to separate with so much Animosity as in other Places: Here I saw the Church of England Cler∣gymen, and the Dissenting Minister, or P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>che<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drinking Tea together, and Con∣versing with Civility and good Neigh∣bourhood, like Catholick Christians, and Men of a Catholick, and extensive Cha∣rity: The Town is populous, tho' not large, the Streets broad, but the Build∣ings old, and low; however, there is good Company and a good deal of it; and a Man that coveted a retreat in this World might as agreeably, spend his time, and as well in Dorchester, as in any Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know in England.</P>
<P>The Downs round this Town are ex∣ceeding pleasant, and come up on every Side, even to the very Streets end; and here it was that they told me, that there were 600 thousand Sheep fed on the Downs, within six Miles of the Town; that is, six Miles every way, whi h is Twelve Miles in Circumference. This I say I was told, I do not affirm it to be true; but when I viewed the Country. I confess I could not but in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>line to be∣lieve it.</P>
<P>It is observable of these Sheep, that they are exceeding Fruitful and the Ews generally b inging two Lambs, and they are for that Reason bought by all the Far∣mers th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o' the East Part of England, who come to Burford Fair in this Country to buy them, and carry them into Kent and Surry Eastward and into Buckingham∣shire, and Bedfordshire, and Oxfordshire North even our Bansted Downs in Surrey, so fam'd for good Mutton, is supply'd from this Place: The Grass, or Herbage of these Downs is full of the sweerest, and the most Aromatick Plants, such as Nourish the Sheep to a strange degree, and the Sheeps Dung again Nourishes that Herbage to a strange degree; so that the Valleys are render'd extreamly Fruit∣ful, by the washing of the Water in hasty Showers from off these Hills.</P>
<P>An eminent Instance of this is seen at Amesbury in Wiltshire, the next County to this, for it is the same thing in pro∣portion over this whole County: I was told that at this Town there was a Mea∣dow on the Bank of the River Avon▪ which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uns thence to Salisbury, which was let for 12 l a Year per Acre for the Grass only: This I enquir'd particularly after, at the Place, and was assurd by the Inhabitants as one Man, that the Fact was true, and was shew'd the Meadows; the Grass which gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on them was such as grew to the length of Ten or Twelve
<PB REF="138" MS="y"/>
Foot, rising to a good Height, and then taking Root again, and was of so rich a Nature as to answer very well such an extravagant Rent.</P>
<P>The Reason they gave for this, was the extraordinary richness of the soil, made so, as above, by the falling, or washings of the Rains from the Hills adjacent, by which tho' no other Land thereabouts had no such a kind of Grass, yet all other Meadows, and low Grounds of the Valley were extreamly rich in Proportion.</P>
<P>There are abundance of good Families, and of very antient Lines of the Neigh∣bourhood of this Town of Dorchester, as the Napiers, the Courtneys, S range∣ways, Seymours, Banks, Tregonills, Se∣denhams, and many others some of which have very great Estates in the County, and in particular Col. Strange∣ways, Napier, and Courtney. The first of these is Master of the famous Swan∣nery, or Nursery of Swans, the like of which I believe is not in Europe; I wonder any Man should pretend to Tra∣vel over this Country, and pass by it too, and then write his Account, and take take no Notice of it.</P>
<P>From Dorchester it is six Miles to the Sea side South, and the Ocean in view almost all the Way: The first Town you come to is Weymouth, or Weymouth and Melcomb, two Towns lying at the Mouth of a little Rivulet, which they call the Wey, butiscarce claims the Name of a River; however, the Entrance makes a very good, tho' small Harbour, and they are join'd by a wooden Bridges so that nothing but the Harbour parts them; yet they are seperate Corporati∣ons, and chose each of them two Mem∣bers of Parliament, just as London and Southwark.</P>
<P>Weymouth is a sweet, clean, agree∣able Town, considering its low Situa∣tion, and close to the Sea; 'tis well built, and has a great many good sub∣stantial Merchants in it; who drive a considerable Trade, and have a good Number of Ships belonging to the Town: They carry on now, in Time of Peace, a Trade with France; but be∣sides this, they trade also to Portugal, Spain, Newfoundland, and Virginia <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they have a large Correspondence also up in the Country for the Con∣sumption of their Returns; especially the Wine Trade, and the Newfoundland Trade are considerable here.</P>
<P>Without the Harbour is an old Ca∣stle, call'd Sandfoot Castle, and over∣against them, where there is a good Road for Ships to put in on Occasions of bad Weather, is Portland Castle and the Road is call'd Portland Road: While <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was here once, there came a Merchant Ship into that Road, call'd Portland Road under a very hard S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm of Wind; she was homeward bound from Oporto for London, laden with Wines, and as she came in, she made Signals of Distress to the Town, firing Guns for Help, and the like, as is usual in such C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se;<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was in the Dark of the Night that the Ship came in and, by the Help of her own Pilot, found her Way into the Road, where she came to an An∣chor, but as I say, fir'd Guns for Help.</P>
<P>The venterous Weymouth-Men went off, even before it was light, with two Boats to see who she was, and what Condition she was in, and found she was come to an Anchor and had struck her Top Masts; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat she had been in bad Weather, had lost an Anchor and Cable before, and had but one Cabero trust to, which did hold her, but was weak; and as the Storm continued to blow, they expected every Hour to go on Shore, and split to pieces.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Weymouth Boats came back with such Diligence, that, in less than three Hours, they were on board them again with an Anchor and Cable, which they immediately bent in its place, and let go to assist the other, and thereby secur'd the Ship: 'Tie true, that they took a good Price of the Master for the Help they gave him, for they made him draw a Bill on his Owners at London for 12 l. for the Use of the An∣chor, Cable, and Boat, besides some
<PB REF="139"/>
Gratuities to the Men: But they sav'd▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ship and Cargo by it, and in three or four Days the Weather was calm, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e proceeded on his Voyage, returning the Anchor and Cable again; so that, upon the whole, it was not so extrava∣gant at first as I thought it to be.</P>
<P>The Isle of Portland, on which the Castle I mention'd stands, lies right a∣gainst this Port of Weymouth: Hence it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that our best and whitest free Store comes, with which the Cathed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al of St. Pauls, the Monument, and all the pub∣lick Edifices in the City of London, are chiefly built; and 'tis wonde ful, and well worth the Observation of a Travel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to see the Quarries in the Rocks, from whence they are cut out, what Stones, and of what prodigious a Size are cut out there</P>
<P>The Island is indeed little more than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e continued Rock of free Stone, and the height of the Land is such, that from this Island they see, in clear Weather, above half over the Channel to France, tho' the Channel here is very broad; the Sea off of this Island especially to the West of it, is counted the most dangerous Part of the British Channel: Due South, there is almost a continued Disturbance in the Waters, by Reason of what they call two Tides meeting, which I take to be no more than the Setts of the Currents from the French Coast, and from the English Shore meeting: This they call Portland Race; and several Ships, not aware of these Currents, have been em∣bay'd to the West of Portland, and been driven on Shore on the Breach, (of which I shall speak presently) and there lost.</P>
<P>To prevent this Danger, and guide the Mariner in these Distresses, they have, within these few Months, set up two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight-Houses on the two points of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sland; and they had not been many Months set up, with the Directions given to the Publick for their Bearings, but we found three outward-bound East-India Ships which were in Distress in the Night, in a hard extream Gale of Wind, were so directed by those Lights, that they avoided going on Shore by it, which, if the Lights had no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been there, would in∣evitably happen'd to their Destruction.</P>
<P>This Island, tho' seemingly miserable, and thinly inhabited, yet the Inhabitants being almost all Stone-cutters, we found there was no very poor People among them; and when they collected Money for the rebuilding St. Paul's, they got more in this island than in the great Town of Dorchester, as we were told.</P>
<P>Tho' Portland stands a League off from the main Land of Britain, yet it is almost joyn'd by a prodigous Riffe of Beach, that is to say, of small Stone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cast up by the Sea, which runs from the Island so near the Shore of England, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey fer∣ry over with a Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and a Rope, the Water not being above half a Stones throw over; and the said Riffe of Beach ending, as it we e, at that Inlet of Water, turns away West and runs paralled with the Sho e quite to Abbotsbury, which is a Town about seven Miles beyond Wey∣mouth.</P>
<P>I name this for two Reasons; first, to explain again what I said before, of Ships being embay'd and lost here. This is when Ships coming from the Westward omit to k ep a good O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, or are t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k n short by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ntrar▪ Winds, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot Wea∣ther the high Land of Portland, but are driven between Portland and the main Land; if th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m come to Anch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd ride it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and good and if no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, they run <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Shore on that vast Beach, a d are lost without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

Assembly of Swans: Here they live, feed and breed, and the Number of them is such, that, I believe, I did not see so few as 7 or 8000. Here they are protected, and here they breed in abundance; we saw several of them upon the Wing, very high in the Air, whence we supposed, that they flew over the Riffe of Beach, which parts the Lake from the Sea to feed on the Shores as they thought sit, and so came home again at their Leisure.</P>
<P>From this Duck-coy West, the Lake narrows, and at last almost closes, till the Beach joyns the Shore; and so Portland may be said not be an Island, but part of the Continent; and now we came to Abbotsbury, a Town anciently famous for a great Monastery, and now eminent for nothing but its Ruins.</P>
<P>From hence we went on to Brid∣port, a pretty large Corporation Town on the Sea Shore, tho' without a Har∣bour: Here we saw Boats all the way on the Shore fishing for Mackerell, which they take in the ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>est Manner imagina∣ble; for they fix one End of the Net to a Pole, set deep into the Sand, then the Net being in a Boat, they row right out into the Water some Length, then turn, and row parallel with the Shore, vering out the Net all the while, till they have let go all Net, except the Line at the End, and then the Boat rows on Shore, when the Men haling the Net to the Shore at both Ends, bring to Shore with it such Fish, as they sur∣rounded in the little Way they rowed; this, at that time, proved to be an in∣credible Number, insomuch, that the Men could hardly draw them on Shore: As soon as the Boats had brought their Fish on Shore, we observed a Guard, or Watch, placed on the Shore in several Places, who we found had their Eye not on the Fishermen, but on the Coun∣try People, who came down to the Shore to buy their Fish; and very sharp we sound they were; and some that came with small Carts were obliged to go back empty, without any Fish. When we came to enquire into the Particu∣lars of this, we found, that these were Officers placed on the Shore by the Jus∣tices and Magistrates of the Towns about, who were order'd to prevent the Coun∣try Farmers buying the Mackerell to dung their Land with them, which was thought to be dangerous, as to infection: In short, such was the plenty of Fish that Year, that the Mackerell, the finest and largest I ever saw, were sold at the Sea side a hundred for a Penny.</P>
<P>From Bridport, a Town in which we see nothing remarkable, we came to Lime, the Town particularly made fa∣mous by the landing the Duke of Mon∣mouth, and his unfortunate Troop, in the Time of King James II. of which I need say nothing, the History of it being so recent in the Memory of so many living.</P>
<P>This is a Town of good Figure, and has in it several eminent Merchants, who carry on a considerable Trade to France, Spain, Newfoundland, and the Streights; and tho' they have neither Creek or Bay, Road, or River, they have a good Harbour; but 'tis such a one as is not in all Britain besides, if there is such a one in any Part of the World.</P>
<P>It is a massy Pile of Building, consisting of high and thick Walls of Stone, rais'd, at first, with all the Methods that Skill and Art could devise. but maintain'd now with very little Difficulty: The Walls are rais'd in the main Sea, at a good Distance from the Shore; it con∣sists of one main and solid Wall of Stone, large enough for Carts and Carriages to pass on the Top, and to admit Houses and Warehouses to be built on it; so that it is broad as a Street; opposite to this, but farther into the Sea, is another Wall of the same Workmanship, which crosses the End of the first Wall, and comes about with a Tail, parallel to the first Wall.</P>
<P>Between the Point of the first or main Wall, is the Entrance into the Port, and the second, or opposite Wall, breaking the Violence of the Sea from the En∣trance, the Ships go into the Basin, as
<PB REF="141" MS="y"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to a Peer, or Harbour, and ride there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> secure as in a Mill Pond, or as in a Wet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ock.</P>
<P>The Town's People have the Benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this wonderful Harbour, and it is care∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly kept in repair, as indeed it behoves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em to do; but they could give me no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of the History of it nor do they, I could perceive, know any thing of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Original of it, or who built it; it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s lately almost beaten down by a Storm, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is repaired again.</P>
<P>This Work is call'd the Cobb: The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stom-House Officers have a Lodge and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arehouse upon it, and there were se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Ships of very good Force, and rich Value, in the Basin of it when I was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re: It might be strengthen'd with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and the Walls themselves are firm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh to carry what Guns they please <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lant upon it; but they did not seem <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hink it needful; and as the Shore is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venient for Batteries, they have some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s planted in proper Places, both for Defence of the Cobb, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>This Town is under the Government <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mayor and Aldermen, and may pass a Place of Wealth, considering the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess of it: Here we found the Mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts began to Trade in the Pitchard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, tho' not to so considerable a De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as they do farther West, the Pitch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seldom coming up so high Eastward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortland, and not very often so high <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime.</P>

<P>While we stay'd here some Time view∣ing this Town and Coast, we had Op∣portunity to observe the pleasant Way of Conversation, as it is manag'd among the Gentlemen of this County, and their Familes, which are without Reflection some of the most polite and well bred People in the Isle of Britain: As their Hospitality is very Great, and their Boun∣ty to the Poor remarkable, so their gener∣ous friendly way of living with Visiting, and Associating one with another is as hard to be describ'd, as it is really to be admir'd; they seem to have a mutual Confidence in, and Friendship with one another, as if they were all Relations; nor did I observe the sharping tricking Temper, which is too much crept in a∣mong the Gameing and Horse-racing Gen∣try in some Parts of England, to be so much known among them, any other∣wise than to be abhorr'd; and yet they sometimes Play too, and make Matches, and Horse-races, as they see occasion.</P>
<P>The Ladies here do not want the help of Assemblies to assist in Match-making; or Halfpay Officers to run away with their Daughters, which the Meetings, call'd Assemblies in some other Parts of Eng∣lang, are recommended for: Here's no Bury Fair, where the Women are scan∣dalously said to carry themselves to Mar∣ket, and where every Night they meet at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lay, or at the Assembly for In∣treagne, and yet I observ'd that the Wo∣men do not seem to stick on Hand so much in this Country, as in those Coun∣tries, where those Assemblies are so late∣ly Set up; the Reason of which I can, not help saying, if my Opinion may bear any weight, is, that the Dorsetshire Ladies are equal in Beauty, and may be Superi∣our in Reputation; In a Word, their Re∣putation seems here to better kept; guard∣ed by better Conduct, and manag'd with more Prudence, and yet the Dorsetshire Ladies, I assure you, are not Nuns, they do not go vail'd about Streets, or hide themselves when Visited; but a general
<PB REF="142" MS="y"/>
f eedom of Conversation, agreeable, Mannerly, Kind, and Good runs thro' the whole body of Gentry of both Sexes, mix'd with the best of Behaviour, and yet govern'd by Prudence and Mode∣sty; such as I no where see better in all my Observation, thro' the whole Isle of Britain. In this little Interval also I visited some of the biggest Towns in the North West Part of this Coun∣try, as Blandford, a Town on the Ri∣ver Stour in the Road between Salis∣bury and Dorchester, a handsome well∣built Town, but chiefly famous for ma∣king the finest Bonelace in England, where they shew'd me some so exqui∣sitely fine; as I think I never saw bet∣ter in Flanders, France or Italy, and which they said, they rated at above 30l. Sterling a Yard; but I suppose there was not much of this to be had, but 'tis most certain, that they make exceeding rich Lace in that County, such as no Part of England can equal.</P>
<P>From thence I went to Stourbride, vulgarly call d Sturbridge; the Town, and the Country round is employ'd in the Manufacture of S ockings, and which was once famous for making the finest, best, and highest Priz'd Knit Stockings in England; but that Trade now is much decay'd by the enerease of the Knitting Stocking Engine, or Frame, has destroyed the hand Knitting-Trade for fine Stockings thro▪ the whole King∣dom, of which I shall speak more in its Place.</P>
<P>From hence I came to Shireburn, a large and populous Town, with one Collegiate, or Conventual Church, and may properly Claim to have more in it than any Town in Dorsetshire, tho' it is neither the County Town, or does it send Members to Parliament; the Church is still a Reverend Pile, and shews the Face of great Antiqui∣ty. Here begins the Wiltshire Medley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loathing; tho' this Town be in Dorset∣shire; of which I shall speak at large in its Place, and therefore I omit any Dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourse of it here.</P>

I cannot pass my Observation here, that when we are come this Length from Lon∣don, the Dialect of the English Tongue, or the Country way of Expressing them∣selves is not easily understond, it is so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t▪ angely altered; it is true, that it is so in many Parts of England besides, but in none in so gross a Degree as in this Part; This way of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oorish Country Speech, as in Ireland, it is called the Brogue upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Tongue; so here 'tis call'd Jouring, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd 'tis certain, that tho▪ the Tongue be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll meer natural English yet those that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re but a little acquainted with them, annot understand one half of what they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay: It is not possible to Explain this ful∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y by writing, because the Difference is ot so much in the Orthography of Words, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the Tone, and Diction; their abridg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the Speech, cham f r I am, chil for I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill, don, for put on, and Doff, for put <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the like.

I observ'd also the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> read it out with his Eyes still on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and his Head like a meer Boy, ving from Side to Side, as the Lines <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cross the Colums of the Book; Lesson was in the Cant. 5 3. of Words these,</P>

<P>How the dexterous Dunce could form his Mouth to express so readily the Words, (which stood right printed in the Book) in his Country Jargon, I could not but admire; I shall add to this another peice as diverting which also happen'd in my Knowledge at this very Town of Teo il, tho' some Years ago.</P>
<P>There liv'd a good substantial Family in the Town, not far from the Angel Inn, a well known House, which was then, and I suppose is still the chief Inn of the Town. This Family had a Dog▪ which among his other good Qualities, for which they kept him (for he was a most notorious Thiesf; but wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hal, so cunning a Dog, and managed himself so warily, that he preserved a mighty good Repu∣tation among the Neighbourhood; as the Family was well beloved in the Town, so was the Dog; he was known to be a very useful Servant to them, especially in the Night, when he was fierce as a Lion, but in the Day the gentlest, lovingest Creature that could be, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as they said, all the Neighbours had a good Word for this Dog.</P>
<P>It happen'd that the good Wise, or Mistress at the Angel I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, had frequently missed several peices of Meat out of the Pail, as they say, or Powdering-tub, as we call it; and that some very large peice; 'tis also to be observ'd the Dog did not stay to eat (what he took) upon the Spot, in which Case some Peices, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Bones, or Fragments might be left, and so it might be discover'd to be a Dog; but he made cleaner Work, and when he fasten'd up∣on a peice of Meat he was sure to carry it quite a way▪ to such Retreats as he knew he could be safe in, and so feast upon it at leisure.</P>
<P>It happen'd at last, as with most Thievs it does, that the Inn-Keeper was to cun∣ning for him, and the poor Dog was nabb'd, taken in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act, and could make no Defence.</P>

<P>I could give many more Accounts of the different Dialects of the People of this Country, in some of which they are really not to be understood, but the Particulars have little or no Diversion in them, they carry it such a Length, that we see their Jou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Speech even upon their Monuments, and Grave-stones; As for Example, even in some of the Church-Yards of the City of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istol, I saw this excellent Poetry after some other Lines—

swimming with the Tide of Flood di∣rectly, out of the Sea into the Harbour. My Friend whose Boat we were in, told me this was a Surprize which he would have been very glad of, if he could but have had a Day or two's Warning, for he might have taken 200 Tun of them, and the like was the Case of other Merchants in Town; for in short, no body was ready for them, ex∣cept a small Fishing Boat, or two; one of which went out into the middle of the Harbour, and at two or three Hawls, took about 40000 of them. We sent our Servant to the Key to buy some, who for a Halfpenny, brought us seventeen, and if he would have taken them, might have had as many more for the same Money; with these we went to Dinner; the Cook at the Inn broil'd them for us, which is their way of dres∣sing them, with Pepper and Salt, which cost us about a Farthing; so that two of us, and a Servant din'd, and at a Ta∣vern too, for three Farthings, Dressing and all, and this is the Reason of tell∣ing the Tale: What Drink, Wine, or Beer we had, I do not remember, but whatever it was, that we paid for by itself; but for our Food we really din'd for three Farthings, and very well too: Our Friend treated us next Day with a Dish of large Lobsters, and I being cu∣rious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o know the Value of such Things, and having freedom enough with him to enquire; I found that for 6d. or 8d. they bought as good Lobsters there, as would have cost in London 3s. to 3s. 6d. each.</P>

The Situation of it between two very large Inlets of the Sea, and in the Bottom of a large Bay, which is very remarkable for the Advantage of Navi∣gation. The Sound or Bay is compass'd on every Side with Hills, and the Shoar generally Steep and Rocky, tho' the An∣chorage is good, and it is pretty s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rid∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng: In the Entrance to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, lyes a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arge and most dangerous Rock, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t High-water is cover'd, but at Low-Tide <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yes bare, where many a good Ship <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as been lost, even in the view of Safety, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd many a Ships Crew drown'd in the Night, before help could be had for them.</P>
<P>Upon this Rock, which was call'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dystone, from its Situation, the famous Mr. Winstanley undertook to build a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight-House for the Direction of Sailors, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd with great Art, and Expedition finish∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it; which Work considering its Height, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Magnitude of its Building, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle Hold there was, by which it was ossible to Fasten it to the Rock, stood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Admiration, and bore out many a bit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Storm.</P>

<P>But he happen'd at last to be in it once <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often; Namely, when that dreadful Tempest blew, Nov. the 27, 1703. This Tempest began on the Wednesday before, and Blew with such Violence, and shook the Light-house so much, that as they told me there, Mr. Winstanly would fain have been on Shoar, and made Signals for help, but no Boats durst go off to him; to finish the Tragedy, on the Friday, Nov. 26, when the Tempest was so redoubled, that it became a Terror to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whole Na∣tion; the first Sight there Seaward, that the People of Plymouth, were presented with in the Morning after the Storm, was the bare Eddystone, the Light-house be∣ing gone; in which Mr. Winstanly▪ and all that were with him perish'd, and were never seen, or heard of since: But that which was a worse loss still, was▪ that a few Days after a Merchant's Ship <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all'd the Winchelsea homeward bou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from Vir∣gina, nor knowing the Eddy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ne Light-House was down; for want of the Light that should have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k itself▪ and was lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> her Lading, and most of her Men, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>e is now another Light-house bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t on the same Rock.</P>

<P>Mr. Cambden observes, that the Town of Foy Quarters some part of the Arms of every one of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Cinque Ports with their own; intimating, that they had at several times trampled over them all; certain it is, they did often beat them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook their Ship, and brought them as good Prizes into their Haven of Foy, and carry'd it so high, that they fitted out their Fleets against the French, and took several of their Men of War when they were at War wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Eng∣land, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ich'd their Town by the spoil of their Enemies.</P>
<P>Edward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>V. favour'd them much, and because the French threaten'd them, to come up their River with a powerful Navy to burn their Town, he caus'd two Forts to be built at the publick Charge, for security of the Town and River, which Forts at least some show of thom remain there still, but the same King Edward was some time after so disgusted at the Townsmen for offi i∣ously falling upon the French after a Truce was made, and proclaim'd, that he effectually di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arm'd them, took away their whole Fleet, Ships, Tackle, Ap∣parel and Furniture; and since that time we do not read of any of their Naval exploits nor that they ever re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over'd, or attempted to recover their Strength at Sea: However, Foy, at this time, is a very fair Town, it lies extended on the

East side of the River for above a Mile the Buildings fair; and there are a great many flourishing Merchants in it, who have a great share in the Fishing Trade especially for Pilchards, of which they take a great quantity hereabouts In this Town▪ is also a Coinage for the Tian, of which a great Quantity is dug up in the Country, North and West of the Town.</P>
<P>The River Fowey, which is very Broad and Deep here, was formerly Navigable by Ships of good Burthen as high as Lestwithiel an ancient, and once a floarishing, but now a decay'd Town, and as to Trade and Navigation quite destitute, which is occasioned by the River being fill'd up with Sands, which some say, the Tides drive up in Sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Weather from the Sea; others say 'tis by Sands wash'd from the Lead Mines in the Hills; the last of which (by the way) I take to be a Mistake, the Sand from the Hills being not of Quantity sufficient to fill up the Chan∣nel of a Navigable River, and if it had, might easily have been stopped by the Towns People from falling into the River; but that the Sea has choak'd up the River with Sand, is not only pro∣bable but true, and there are other Rivers which suffer in the like manner in this same Country.</P>
<P>This Town of Lestwithiel, retains however several Advantages, which sup∣port its Figure, as first, that it is one of the Coinage Towns, as I call them, or Stanuary Towns, as others call them. (2.)

<P>I HAVE ended this Account at the utmost Extent of the Island of Great Britain West, without visiting those Excressences of the Island▪ as I think I may call them, viz. the Rocks of Scilly, of which, what is most famous, is their infamy, or Re∣proach: Namely, How many good Ships are, almost continually dash'd in pieces there, and how many brave Lives lost, in spight of the Mariners best Skill or the Light-Houses, and other Sea Marks of best Notice.</P>
<P>These Islands lie so in the middle be∣tween the two vast openings of the North and South narrow Seas, or as the Sailors call then the Bristol Channel, and the Channel, (so call'd by way of Eminence) that it cannot, or perhaps never will be avoided, but that several Ships in the dark of the Night, and in stress of Wea∣ther may by being out in their Reckon∣ings, or other unavoidable Accidents mi∣stake, and if they do, they are sure, as the Sailors call it, to run bump a Shore upon Scilly, where they find no Quarter among the Breakers, but are beat to pieces, without any possibili∣lity of Escape.</P>

<P>Nor is it seldom that the voracious Country People scuffle and fight about the Right to what they find, and that in a desperate manner, so that this Part of Cornwall may truly be said to be inha∣bited by a fierce and ravenous People; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are so greedy, and eager for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that they are charged with strange, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and cruel Dealings, even some∣times with one another, but especially with po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> distressed Sea-men when they come on Sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by force of a Tempest, and seek help for their Lives, and where they find the Rocks themselves not more merciless than the People who range a∣bout them for their Prey.</P>
<P>Here also, as a farther Testimony of the immense Riches which have been lost at several tim s upon this Coast, we found several Engineers, and Projectors; some with one sort of diving Engine, add some with another; some claiming such a wreck, and some such and such others; where they alledg'd, they were assured there were g eat Quantitie of Money; and strange unpre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edented Ways were used by them to come at it; Some, I say, with one kind of Engine, and some ano∣ther; and tho' we thought several of them very strange impracticable Me∣thods, yet, I was assur'd by the Country People, that they had done Wonders with them under Water, and that some of them had taken up things of great Weight, and in a great Depth of Water; others had split open the Wrecks they had found, in a manner one would have thought not possible to be done, so far under Water, and had taken out things from the very Holds of the Ships; but we could not learn, that they had come at any pieces of Eight, which was the thing they seemed most to aim at, and depend up on; at least they had not found any great Quantity, as they said they expected.</P>
<P>However, we left them as busy as we found them, and far f om being discourag∣ed, and if half the Golden Mountains, or Silver Mountains either, which they promise themselves, should appear, they will be very well paid for their Labour.</P>
<P>From the Tops of the Hills, on this Extremity of the Land, you may see out into that they call the Chop, of the Chan∣nel, whi h, as it is the greatest Inlet of Commerce, and the most frequenced by Merchant Ships of any Place in the World; so one seldom looks out to Sea∣ward, but something, new presents; that is to say, of Ships passing or repassing, either on the great or lesser Cannel.</P>
<P>Upon a former accidental Journey into this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the Country, during the War with France, it was with a mixture of Pleasure and Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or that we saw from the Hills at the Lizard, which is the Souther∣most Point of this Land an obstinate Fight between three French-men of War, and two English, wi h a Privateer, and three Merchant-Ships in their Company▪ the English had the Misfortune, not only to be fewer Ships of War in Number, but of less Force; so that while the two biggest French Ships engaged the English, the Third in the mean time took the two Merchant-Ships, and went off with them; as to the Piccaroo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or Privateer, she was able to do little in the Matter, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t dur∣ing to come so ne r the Men of War, as to take a B oadside, which her thin Side▪would not have been able to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, but would have sent her to the Bottom at once; so that the English Men of War had no Assistance f om her, nor o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld she prevent the taking the two Merchant Ships; yet we observed that the English Captains managed their F ght so well, and their Seamen behaved so briskly, that in about three Hou s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the French∣men stood off and being suffi iently bang'd, let us see that they had no more Stomach to Fight; after whi h the Eng∣lish, having Damage enough too no doubt,

stood away to the Eastward, as we sup∣pos'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fit</P>
<P>This Point of the Lizard, which runs out to the Southward, and the other Promontory mention'd above, make the two Angles, or Horns, as they are call'd, from whence 'tis suppos'd this County re∣ceiv'd its first Name of Cornwall, or as Mr. Cambden says, Cornubia in the Lat∣in, and in the British Kernaw, as running out in two vastly extended Horns; and indeed it seems, as if Nature had form'd this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ituation for the Direction of Mari∣ners, as foreknowing of what Importance it should be, and how in future Ages these Seas should be thus throng'd with Mer∣chant Ships▪ the Protection of whole Wealth, and the Safety of the People; navigating them, was so much her early Care, that she stretched out the Land so very many ways, and extended the Points and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies so for, and in so many diffe ent places into the Sea, that the Land might be more easily discover'd at a due Distance, which way soever the Ships should come.</P>
<P>Nor is the Lizard Point less useful (tho' not so far West) than the other, which is more properly call'd the Land's End; but if we may Credit our Mariners, it is more frequently, first discover'd f om the Sea; for as our Mariners knowing by the Soundings when they are in the Mouth of the Channel, do then most na∣turally stand to the Southward, to avoid mistaking the Channel, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> un the Seven Sea, or Bristol Channel, but still more to avoid running upon Scilly, and the Rocks about it, as is observed before: I say, as they carefully keep to the South∣ward, till they think they are fair with the Channel, and then stand to the Northward again, or North East, to make the Land; this is the Reason why the Lizard is generally speaking, the first Land they make, and not the Land's-End.</P>
<P>Then having made the Lizard, they either (fi st) run in for Falmouth, which is the next Port, if they are taken short with Easterly Winds, or are in want of Provisions and Refreshment, or have any thing out of Order, so that they care not to keep the Sea, or, (2dly) stand a∣way for the Ram Head, and Ply <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh Sound, or (3dly) keep an Offing to run up the Channel.</P>
<P>So that the Lizard is the general Guide, and of more use in these Cases than the other point, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Land, which the Ships choose to make first, for then also they are sure that they are past Scilly, and all the dan∣gers of that part of the Island</P>
<P>Nature has fortify'd this part of the Island of Britain in a strange manner, and so as she is worth a Traveller's Ob∣servation, as if she new the Force and Violence of the mighty Ocean, which beats upon it; and which indeed, it the Land was not made firm in Propo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, could not withstand, but would have been wash'd away long ago,</P>
<P>Fi st, there are the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sland, of Scill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Rocks about them, these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> placed like Out-works to resist the first Assaults of this Enemy, and so break the Force of it; as the Piles, or Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lings (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are called) are placed before the solid Stone work of London-Bridge, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣fence off the Force, either of the Water▪ or Ice, or any thing else that might be dangerous to the Work.</P>
<P>Then there are a vast Number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rocks, (so the Seamen call them,) be∣sides such as are visible, and above Water▪ which gradually lesson the Quan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i y o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Water, that would otherwise lye <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> infinite Weight and Force upon the Land; 'tis observed, that these Rocks lye under Water for a great way off into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on every Side the said two Horns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Points of Land; so breaking the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Water, and as above lessening the Weight of it.</P>
<P>But besides this, the whole Terra <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or Body of the Land, which makes this Part of the Isle of Britain, seems to be one solid Rock, as if it was formed by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ature to resist the otherwise irresisti∣ble Power of the Ocean, and indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one was to observe with what Fury <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Sea comes on sometimes against the shore there, especially at the Lizard Point, where there are but few, if any Out∣works, (as I call them to resist it, How high the Waves come rowling forward, storming on the Neck of one another; particularly when the Wind blows off Sea, one would wonder, that even the strongest Rocks themselves should be able to resist, and repel them.

<P>And yet, as if all this was not enough, Nature has p ovided another strong <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence, and that is, that these vast Rocks <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, as it were, cemented together by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he solid and weighty Oar of Tin and Copper, especially the last, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lentifully found upon the very utmost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge of the Land, and with which the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tones may be said to be Soder'd together, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the Force of the Sea should separate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d disjoint them, and so break in upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se Fortifications of the Island, to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roy its chief Security.</P>
<P>This is certain, that there is a more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an ordinary Quantity of Tin, Copper, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Lead also placed by the great Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctor of Nature in these very remote <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngles; and, as I have said above, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r is found upon the very Surface of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rocks a good way into the Sea, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it does not only lie, as it were, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, or between the Stones among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earth, which in that Case might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed from it by the Sea, but that it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>even blended or mix'd in with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes themselves, that the Stones must split into pieces to come at it; by this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture the Rocks are made infinitely Weighty and Solid, and thereby still the more qualified to repel the Force of the Sea.</P>
<P>Upon this remote part of the Island we saw great Numbers of that famous kind of Crows, which is known by the Name of the Cornish Cough, or Chough, so the Country People call them: They are the same kind, which are found in Switzerland among the Alph, and which Pliny pretended, w re peculiar to those Mountains, and calls the Pyrrhocorax; the Body is Black, the Legs, Feet, and Bill of a deep Yellow; almost to a Red; I could not fi d that it was affected for and good quality it had, nor is the Flesh good to eat, for it seeds much on Fish and Carrion, it is counted little better than a Kite, for it is of ra∣venous Quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the House, that is not too heavy, tho' fit not for its Food, as Knives, Forks Spoons and Linnen Cloths, or whatever it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of Firebrands, or lighted Candles, and lodged them in the Stacks of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn, and the Thatch of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rns and Houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral Tradition.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had once, indeed, resolved to have coasted the whole Circuit of Britain by Sea, as 'tis said, Agricola the Roman General did; and in this Voyage I would have gone about every Promontory, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o the Bottom of every Bay, and had provided myself a good Yatcht, and an able Commander for that Purpose; but I found at would be too hazardous an Undertaking for any Man to justify him∣self in the doing it upon the mee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Foun∣dation of Curiosity, and having no other Business at all, so I gave it over.</P>

<P>Padstow is a large Town, and stands on a very good Harbour for such Ship∣ping as use that Coast, that is to say, for the Irish Trade: The Harbour is the Mouth of the River Camel, or Camal, which rising at Camelford, runs down by Bodwyn to Wodbridge or Wardbridge, a large Stone Bridge of Eight Acres, or thereabouts, built by the general good Will of the Country Gentlemen? but at the Motion of a religious Man, named Lovibond, moved in mere Charity; the Passage over the River there, before, be∣ing very dangerous, and having been the Loss of some Lives, as well as Goods. The Passage from this Town of Padstow to Ireland, is called, by Wri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, to be no more than Twenty-four Hours, but not justly: It is true, that Padstow being the first, and best, if not the only Haven on this Shore, the Trade from Ireland settled here of Course, and a great many Ships in this Harbour, are imploy'd in the Commerce; but to say, they make the Voyage in Four and Twenty Hours, is to say, it has been so, or, on extraordinary Gales of fair Wind, it may be done; but not One in Twenty four Ships makes its Voyage in twenty four Hours; and, I believe, it may be said, they are oftener Five or Six Days in the Passage.</P>

<P>I came out of Cornwall by passing the River Tamar at Launceston, the last, or rather, the first Town in the Count the Town shewing little else, but Mar of its Antiquity; for great Part of it is old, as it may, in a manner, pass for old, ragged, decay'd Place; in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it stands at a Distance, almost two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the River, over which, there is very good Bridge; the Town is emin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> however, for being as we call it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> County Town, where the A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>zes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> always kept.</P>

<P>It is a principal Gain to the People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Town, that they let Lodgings to the Gentlemen, who attend here in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Assiz s, and other publick Meeting as particularly that of electing Knight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and at the County Session which are held here; for which Purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Town's People have their Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> better fu nished than in other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aces this Country, though their Houses are b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣low; nor do they fail to make a g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Price to their Lodgers, for the Conve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ences they afford them.</P>

<P>As we are just entered Devonshire, as I said above, it seems, at first Sight a wild, barren poor Country; but we ride but a few Miles, 'till we find an Alterati∣on in several Things: 1. More People; 2. Larger Towns; 3. The People all busy and in full Employ upon their Manufac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures.</P>
<P>At the uppermost, and extreme Part of the County, N. W. there runs a huge Promontory, a Mountain like Proboscis, into the Sea, beyond all the Land on ei∣ther Side, whether of Devonshire, or of Cornwall. This they would fain have called Hercules's Promontory, and Mr. Cambden, in his Writing▪ and his Map∣maker also, calls it Herculis Promontori∣um; but the honest Sailors, and after them, the plain Country People, call it▪ in down right modern English▪ Hartland Point, or, Hearty Point, from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Town of Hartland, which stands just within the Shore, and is on the very utmost Edge of the County of Devon: It is a Market Town, though so remote, and of good Resort too, the People coming to it out of Cornwall, as well as out of Devon∣shire; and particularly the Fisher-Boats of Barnstable Biddiford, and other Towns on the Coast lying often under the Lee▪ as they call it, of these Rocks, for Shel∣ter from the S. W or S. E. Winds, the Seamen go on Shore here and supply themselves with Provisions; nor is the Town unconcerned in that gainful Fish∣ing Trade, which is carried on for the Herrings on this Coast▪ many Seamen and Fishing Vessels belonging to the Town.</P>
<P>From this Point or Promontory, the Land, falling away for some Miles, makes a Gulph or Bay, which, reachin g to the Head Land, or Point of Barnstable River or Haven, is called from thence, Barn∣stable Bay; into this Bay, or at the W. E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of this Bay, the Rivers Taw and Tower empty themselves at one Mouth, that is to say, in one Channel; and it is very particular, that as two Rivers join in one Channel, so here are two great Trading Towns in one Port, a thing which
<PB REF="168"/>
as it is not usual, so I cannot say 'tis any Advantage to either of them; for it na∣turally follows, that they rival one ano∣ther, and lessen both; whereas, had they been join'd together in one Town, or where it possible to join them, they would make the most conside able Town, or City rather, in all this Part of Eng∣land.</P>
<P>These are the Towns of Barnstable and Biddiford, or, as some write it, Bedi∣ford; the first of these is the Antient, the last the most Flourishing; the Harbour or River is in its Entrance the same to both, and when they part, the Tower turning to the Right, or South West, and the Taw to the S E. yet they seem to be both so safe, so easy in the Chan∣nel▪ so equally good with respect to Ship∣ping, fo equi-distant from the Sea, and so equally advantageous, that neither Town complains of the Bounty of the Sea to them, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Situation by Land; and yet, of late Years, the Town of Bid∣disord has flourished, and the Town of Barnstable rather declin'd.</P>
<P>Biddiford is pleasant, clean, well-built Town; the more antient Street which lies next the River, is very pleasant, where is the Bridge, a very noble Key, and the Custom-house; this Part also is very well built and populous, and fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts the River for above three quarters of a Mile: But besides this, there is a new spacious Street, which runs N. and S. or rather N. W. and S E. a great length, broad as the high Street of Excester, well-built, and, which is more than all, well inhabited, with considerable and wealthy Merchants who trade to most Porrs of the trading World.</P>
<P>Here, as is to be seen in almost all the Market Towns of Devonshire, is a very large, well-built, and well-sinish'd Meet∣ing house, and, by the Multitude of eo∣ple which I saw come out of it, and the Appearance of them, I thought all the Town had gone thither, and began to enquire for the Church: But when I came to the Church, I found that also, large▪ spacious, and well filled too, and that with People of the best Fashion. The Person who officiates at the Meet∣ing houses in this Town, I happened to have some Conversation with, and found him to be not only a learned Man, and Master of good Reading; but a most ac∣ceptable Gentlemanly Person, and one, who, contrary to our receiv'd Opinion of those People, had not only good Learn∣ing, and good Sense, but abundance of good Manners, and good Humour▪ no∣thing Soure, Cynical or Morose in him, and, in a Word, a very valuable Man: And as such a Character, always re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om∣mends a Man to Men of Sense and good Breeding; so I found this Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n was very well received in the Place, even by those who he differ'd from in Matters o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Religion, and those Differences did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to as is usual, make any Breach in their conversing with him. His Name▪ as I remember was Bartlet But this is a Digression: I wish I could say the like of all the rest of his B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hren.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town being very much in Fish as it is also of all the Towns on this Coast, I observed here▪ that several Ships were employ'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Leverpool, and up the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Warrington, to fetch the Rock <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which is found in that County (and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I shall say more in my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> those Parts) which Rock Salt they b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g to Biddiford and Barnstable and he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they dissolve it into Brine in the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter, joyning the strength of two Bodies into one, and then boil it up again <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a new Salt, as the Dutch do by the French and Portuguese Salt: This is ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ly call'd Salt, and with this they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Herrings; and as this is a Trade which can be but of a few Years <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because the Rock itself has not be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> discover'd in England much above <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Years; so the Difference in curing the Fish has been such, and it has so recom∣mended their Herrings in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ign Mar∣kets, that the Demand for them has co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣siderably increased, and consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trade.</P>
<P>There is indeed, a very fine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bridge over the River here, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Biddiford has a greater Number <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rchants, Barnstable has a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> within Land, by its great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Irish Wooll and Yarn, &amp;c. with the Serge-Makers of Tiverton and Excester, who come up hither to buy. So that, in a Word<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barnstable, though it has lost Ground to Biddiford, yet, take it all in its Trade compleatly, is full as considerable as Biddiford▪ only, that perhaps, it was formerly far superior to it, and the other has risen up to be a Match to it.</P>
<P>Barnstable is a large, spacious, well∣built Town, more populous than Biddi∣ford, but not better built, and stands lower; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>somuch, that at high Water in Spring Tides, it is, as it were, sur∣rounded with Water; the Bridge here, was built by the generous Gift of one Stamford, a Citizen and Merchant of London, who, it seems, was not a Na∣tive of this Place, but by Trading here to his Gain, had Kindness enough for the the Town, to offer such a Benefaction to them as they enjoy the Benefit of to this Day.</P>
<P>The Bridge at Biddiford as above, was likewise a Gift: but was, as they say, done by C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lections among the Clergy, by Grant of Indulgences and the like Church Management. But be it how it will▪ both the Towns are in∣finitely obliged to the Benefactors.</P>
<P>Behind Biddiford, that is as we come from Launceston, are several good Towns though I observ'd that the Country was wild and barren; as Tavistock, belonging to the House of Bedford, and giving the Title of Marquis, to the el∣dest Son of that illustrious Ducal Fami∣ly; the Town of Torrington, on the same River Towridge that Biddiford stands on; the Title of Earl of Torring∣ton, was first given to the late General Monk, Duke of Albemarle, in Honour, and for a Reward of his Loyalty, in restoring King Charles II. and the Line being extinct in his Son, it was given by King William III. to Admiral Her∣bert, who came over with him, and was immediately made Admiral of the British Fleet, to defend the Possession of the Crown in the Person of that Prince;
<PB REF="170"/>
and since that to Sir George Bing, one of our present Admirals, and one who asserted the Authority and Power of the British Navy against the Spaniards, at the late Sea Fight near Cape Pas∣saro in Sicily: So that the Town of Torrington, seems to be appropriated to the honour of the Defenders of the British Sovereignty at Sea.</P>
<P>Another Town in this part of the Country is Okehampton, vulgarly O∣kington, a good Market Town, which gave Title of Baron to the Lord Mo∣hun, and sends two Members to Par∣liament; it is a Manufacturing Town, as all the Towns this Way now are, and pretty rich; and having said this, I have said all, unless it be, that in the Records of Antiquity, it appears to have been much more considerable than it is now, having 92 Knights Fees belonging to it. But as I studiously avoid med∣dling with Antiquity in these Accounts, studying to give you the present State of the Countries and Towns through which I travel, rather than what they have been; so I say no more of those Things than needs must.</P>
<P>A little above Barnstable, North-East upon the Coast, stands a good Market and Port Town, call'd Ilfar Comb, a Town of good Trade, populous and rich, all which is owing to its having a very good Harbour and Road for Ships, and where Ships from Ireland often put in, when, in bad Weather, they cannot, without the extremest Hazard, run into the Mouth of the Taw, which they call Barnstable Water; and this is one Reason, which causes the Merchants at Barnsta∣ble, to do much of their Business at this Port of Ilfar-Comb.</P>
<P>Antiquity tells us long Stories, of the Danes landing on this Coast; of Hubba, the Danish King, being slain here, that is at Kennith Castle, between this Place and the Mouth of the Taw and Tow∣ridge, and that the Place was call'd Hubbestow ever after, from the Bury∣ing of this Prince there: All this may be true, for ought we know, but I could neither find or hear of this Castle of Kennith, or Burial Place, Hubbestow or any thing of the Ruins or Remain of them in the Country, so I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you no farther about them.</P>
<P>The Sea Coast in this County, tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able little farther East by North, but I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound there was nothing of Moment to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there, except fishing Towns, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Creeks, on which are Two small Mar∣ket Towns, such as Combemerton are, and Porlock, 'till we came to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> head.</P>
<P>Leaving the Coast, we came, in our going Southward, to the great River Ex, or Isca, which rises in the Hills on this North side of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and that so far, as, like the Tamar, it be∣gins within Four or Five Miles of the Severn Sea, the Country it rises i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called Exmore, Cambden calls it a filthy barren Ground, and, indeed, so it is▪ but as soon as the Ex comes off from the Moors, and hilly Country, and de∣scends into the lower Grounds, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound the Alteration; for then we saw De∣vonshire in its other Countenance, viz. Cultivated, Populous, and Fruitful; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d continuing so till we came to Tiver∣ton, a Town which I mention'd before, but did not fully describe</P>
<P>Next to Excester, this is the greatest manufacturing Town in the County, and, of all the inland Towns, is next to it in Wealth, and in Numbers of Peo∣ple; it stands on the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> has over it, a very fine Bridge, with another over the little River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which, immediately after, falls into the Ex just before the Town: An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quity says, before those Bridges were built, there were two Fords here, one through each River, and that the Town was from thence called Twyford-ton, that is, the Town upon the two Fords, and so by abbreviating the Sounds Twy∣sor ton, then Tiverton; but that I leave to the learned Searchers into an∣tient Things.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of Tiverton is the Free-School, at the East Entrance into
<PB REF="171"/>
the Town, a noble Building, but a much nobler Foundation; it was erected by one Peter Blundel, a Clothier and a Lover of Learning, who used the saying of William of Wickham to the King when he found∣ed the Royal School at Winchester, viz. That if he was not himself a Scholar, he would be the Occasion of making more Scholars, than any Scholar in England; to which End he founded this School: He has endowed it with so liberal a Main∣tenance, that, as I was informed, the School-master has, at least, Sixty Pounds per Annum, besides a very good House to live in, and the Advantage of Scholars not on the Foundation, and the Usher in Proportion; and to this he added Two Fellowships, and Two Scholarships, which he gave the Maintenance for to Sydney College in Cambridge, and one Fellow∣ship, and Two Scholarships, to Baliol-Col∣lege in Oxford, all which are appointed for the Scholars bred up in this School, and the present reverend Master, was a Scholar upon the Foundation in the same School.</P>
<P>As this is a manufacturing Country, as above, we found the People, here, all ful∣ly employ'd, and very few, if any, out of Work, except such as need not be un∣employ'd, but were so from mere Sloth and Idleness, of which, some will be found every where.</P>
<P>From this Town, there is little belong∣ing to Devonshire, but what has been spoken of, except what lies in the Road to T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unton, which we took next, where we meet with the River Columb, a River rising also in the utmost Limits of the Shire towards Somersetshire, and giving Name to so many Towns on its Banks, as leaves no Room to doubt of its one Name being right, such as Columb David's, Ufcolumbe, Columstock, and Columbron; the last is a Market Town, and they are all full of Manufacturers, depending much on the Master Manufacturers of Tiver∣ton.</P>
<P>With this Town, we leave the County of Devon, and entering Somersetshire, have really a Taste of a different Country from Devonshire; for entering Willing∣ton, the first Town we came at in Somer∣setshire, though partly employ'd in manu∣facturing too, we were immediately sur∣rounded with Beggars, to such a Degree, that we had some Difficulty to keep them from under our Horse Heels.</P>
<P>It was our Misfortune at first, that we threw some Farthings, and Halfpence, such as they had, among them; for thinking by this to be rid of them, on the con∣trary, it brought out such a Croud of them, as if the whole Town was come out into the Street, and they r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in this Manner after us through the whole Street, and a great way after we were quite out of the Town; so that we were glad to ride as fast as we could through the Town to get clear of them; I was, indeed, astonished at such a Sight, in a Country where the People were so generally full of Work, as they were here; for in Corn: wall, where there are hardly any Manu∣facturers, and where there are, indeed, abundance of Poor, yet we never found any thing like this.</P>
<P>Before I quite leave Devonshire, I must mention one Thing, which I observed at my first setting out; namely, That I would take Notice how every County in England furnish'd something of its Pro∣duce towards the Supply of the City of London: Now I must allow, that Corn∣wall is, in some respects, an Exception to this Rule, because, though it is fruitful enough for the Supply of its own Inha∣bitants, yet, in the first Place, the waste Grounds are so many, the Inhabitants so numerous, and the County so narrow, that, except the Herrings, a few of which may be brought to London for Sale, they have not much Overplus to furnish other Parts with; but then they make us A∣mends by sending up an immense Wealth in their Tin, Lead, and Copper, from the Bowels of their barren Mountains, and the Export of the Pilchards, and Herrings, from both their Shores to Spain and Italy, from whence much of the Re∣turns are again brought to London for their Vent and Consumption.</P>
<P><PB REF="172"/>
In like Manner, the County of Devon has been rich in Mines of Tin and Lead, though they seem at present, wrought out; and they had their Stannary Towns and Coinage, as well as in Cornwall; nay, so numerous were the Miners or Tinners, as they are called in this Coun∣ty, that they were, on occasion of a Na∣tional Muster, or Defence, regimented by themselves, arm'd, and officer'd by themselves, and were, in short, a separate Militia from the Trained Bands, or Mili∣tia of the County; but now we see the Tin Works in Devonshire is quite laid a∣side, not One Tin Mine being at work in the whole County; There are, indeed, some Copper▪works undertaken on the North Side, as we were told; but I do not find, that they are yet brought to any Perfection, and about Ilfarcomb, Comb Mertin, also at Delverton, in the North Part of the County, they have been at Work to see if they can recover some Sil∣ver Mines, which, in the Time of King Edward III. were so large, that they em∣ployed Three hundred Miners, besides other Workmen, and brought that Prince great Sums of Money for the carrying on his Wars against France: What Pro¦gress they are now like to make in it, I cannot yet learn.</P>
<P>But there is one Article in the Produce of Devonshire, which makes good what I have written before, That every Coun∣ty contributes something towards the Sup∣ply of London; and this is, the Cyder which I have mentioned already, and which takes up the South Part of the Coun∣ty, between Topsham and Axmenster, where they have so vast a Quantity of Fruit, and so much Cyder made, that sometimes they have sent Ten, or Twen∣ty thousand Hogsheads of it in a Year to London, and at a very reasonable rate too.</P>
<P>The County of Somerset joins to the N. W. Part of Devonshire. I touched only upon One Point of the County in my last, as I went West. The whole County is worth a more particular Ac∣count, than can be given within the Space of a Letter.</P>
<P>I entered the County, as I observed a∣bove, by Wellington, where we had the Entertainment of the Beggars, from whence we came to Taunton, vulgarly cal∣led Taunton Dean upon the River Ton, this is a large, wealthy, and exceedingly populous, Town: One of the chief Ma∣nufacturers of the Town told us, That there was at that Time so good a T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade in the Town, that they had then eleven hundred Looms going for the weaving of Sagathies Du Roys, and such kind of Stuffs, which are made there; and that which added to the Thing very much, was, that not one of those Looms want∣ed Work: He farther added, That there was not a Child in the Town, or in the Villages round it, of above Five Years old, but, if it was not neglected by its Parents, and untaught, could earn its own Bread. This was what I never met with in any Place in England, except at Col∣chester in Essex.</P>
<P>This Town chooses Two Members of Parliament, and their Way of choosing is, by those who they call Pot-Walloners, that is to say, Every Inhabitant, whether House-keeper or Lodger, that dresses their own Victuals; to make out which, several Iumares, or Lodgers, will, sometime be∣fore the Election, bring out their Pots, and make Fires in the Street, and boil their Victuals in the sight of their Neigh∣bours, that their Votes may not be cal∣led in Question.</P>
<P>There are Two large Parish Churches in this Town, and Two or Three Meet∣ing-Houses, whereof one, is said to be the largest in the County: The Inhabi∣tants have been noted for the Number of Dissenters; for among them it was al∣ways counted a Seminary of such: They suffered deeply in the Duke of Mon∣mouth's Rebellion, but paid K. James home for the Cruelty exercised by Jef∣fries among them; for when the Prince of Orange arrived, the whole Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in to him, with so universal a Joy, that
<PB REF="173"/>
'twas thought, if he had wanted it, he might have raised a little Army there, and in the adjacent Part of the Coun∣try.</P>
<P>There was, and, I suppose, is still, a private College, or Academy, for the Dissenters in this Town; the Tntor, who then managed it, was named Warren, who told me, that there were Three∣score and Twelve Ministers then Preach∣ing, whereof Six had conformed to the Church, the rest were among the Dis∣senters, who had been his Scholars, whereupon, One of his own Sort had, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eems, stiled him the Father of the Faithful: The Academy, since his Death, is continued, but not kept up to the Degree it was, in the Days of the said Mr. Warren.</P>
<P>From this Town of Taunton, which is by far the greate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all this Part of the Country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more People in it than the City of York, we went North to take a View of the Coast. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ere, of which mention was made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the River EX rises, lies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Way, Part of it in this Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Sea Side: It gives, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a melancholy View, being a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of barren, and desolate Lands; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Coast, there are some very o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea Ports. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Porlock, on the very utmost Extent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Country; it has a small Harbour, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f no Importance, nor has it any thing of Trade, so I need but name it.</P>
<P>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chead, the best Port, and safest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bour, in all these Counties, at least, a this Side: No Ship is so big, but it ay come in, and no Weather so bad, it the Ships are safe when they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they told me, that in the great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm Anno 1703. when in all the Har∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs and Rivers in the County, the Ships <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re blown on Shore, wreck'd, and lost, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y suffered little or no Damage in this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>our.</P>
<P>The Trade of this Town lies chiefly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ireland, and this was, for many ars, the chief Port in this Part of England, where Wool from Ireland was allowed to be imported; but that Liber∣ty is since inlarged to several other Ports by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>This Corporation sends Two Members to the Parliament, which are chosen al∣so, as at Taunton, by the Pot Wallon∣ers; the Town is well built, is full of rich Merchants, and has some Trade also to Virginia, and the West-Indies: They correspond much with the Merchants of Barustable, and Bristol, in their Foreign Trade.</P>
<P>There are some very good Families, and of very ancient standing, in this part of the County, among which, the Fami∣lies of Seymour, of Portman, of Or∣chard, Wyndham, Popham of Welling∣ton, Mallet, an ancient Family of Nor∣man Extraction, Mohun, Beauchamp, and some others, are most eminent; the Mo∣huns in particular were anciently Lords of Dunstar Castle, at a small Distance from the Sea, and very strong. Here former∣ly was the ancient Mansion, or Inheri∣tance, of the Lords Mohun, who, as a∣bove, long enjoy'd it: Who it will now descend to, that ancient Family being ex∣tinct in the Person of the late unhappy Lord Mohun, who was kill'd in a Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> with Duke Hamilton, I could not learn</P>
<P>From hence the Coast bear back Wed to Watchet, a small Port also, but of no Importance, that is to say, 'tis of no Im∣portance now; for if we may calculate Things present, by Things past, the Towns of Porlock and Watchet, which were once important Places; and the Reason is clear, since the Increase of Shipping and Trade, and the Improve∣ment of the navigating Skill, bigger Ships being brought into Use, than were for∣merly built; acordingly, larger Ports, and deeper Water, were requisite to la∣bour such Vessels, than would serve for that Purpose before; and the Harbour at Minchead being fairer, and much deeper, than those at Watchet and Porlock, and therefore able to secure those grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣er Ships, which the others were not,
<PB REF="174"/>
the Merchants removed to it; and thus, in Time, the Town grew up, to what we now find it to be.</P>
<P>From hence the winding Shore brings us to Bridgewater. This is an ancient and very considerable Town and Port, it stands at the Mouth of the River Par∣rat, or Perot, which comes from the South, after having received the River Tone from the West, which is made na∣vigable up to Taunton, by a very fine Channel, cut at the Expence of the Peo∣ple of Taunton, and which, by the Na∣vigation of it, is infinitely advantageous to that town and well worth all their Expence, first by bringing up Coals, which are brought from Swanzey in Wales by Sea to Bridgewater, and thence by Barges up this River to Taunton; also for bringing all heavy Goods and Merchandizes from Bristol, such as Iron, Lead, Oyl, Wine, Hemp, Flax, Pitch, Tar, Grocery, and Dye Stuffs, and the like; their Tobacco they generally re∣ceived from Barnstable by Land, which is about sixteen Miles West.</P>
<P>This Town of Bridgewater, is a po∣pulous, trading Town, is well built, and as well inhabited, and has many Fami∣lies of good Fashion dwelling in it, be∣sides Merchants. The famous Admiral Blake, was a Native of this Town. Here it was, that the Duke of Monmouth, finding himself defeated in his Expecta∣tion of the City of Bristol, and repuls'd at the City of Bath, and press'd by the Approach of the King's Troops, who endeavou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to surround him, made his Retreat; where, finding the King's Troops followed him, and seem'd resolved to attack him, he went up to the Top of the Steeple, with some of his Officers, and viewing the Situation of the King's Army, by the Help of Perspectives, resolved to make an Attempt upon them the same Night, by way of Prevention, and accordingly march'd out of the Town in the Dead of the Night to at∣tack them, and had he not, either by the Treachery, or Mistake of his Guides, been brought to an unpassable Ditch, where he could not get over, in the In∣terval of which, the King's Troops took the Alarm, by the firing a Pistol among the Duke's Men, whether, also, by Ac∣cident, or Treachery, was not known; I say, had not those Accidents, and his own Fate, conspired to his Defeat, he had certainly cut the Lord Feversham's Army (for he commanded them) all to Pieces; but by these Circumstances, he was brought to a Battle on unequal terms, and defeated: the rest I need not mention.</P>
<P>This Town was regularly fortified in the late Civil Wars, and sustain'd two sieges, if not more; the situation of it renders it easiy to be fortified, the River and Haven taking one chief Part of the Circumference; over the River, they have a very good Bridge of stone, and the tide rises here, at High Water, near six Fathoms, whereof, sometimes it comes in with such furious Haste, as to come two Fathoms deep at a time, and when it does so, by surprize, it often does great damage to ships, driving them foul of one ano∣ther, and oftentimes oversetting them. This sudden Rage of the Tide, is called, the Boar, and is frequent in all the Ri∣vers of this Channel, especially in the Severn itself; 'tis also known in the North, particularly in the Trent, and the Oule, at their Entrance into Humber, and several other Places.</P>
<P>In this Town of Bridgewater, besides a very large Church, there is a fine new▪ built Meeting house, that is to say, built since the Toleration, in which 'tis remark∣able, that they have an advanc'd Seat for the Mayor and Aldermen, when any of the Magistrates should be of their Com∣munion, as sometimes has happened. Here, also, is a College, or private A∣cademy, for the Dissenters to breed up their preaching Youth; the Tutor was one Mr. Moor, a Man who it is own'd, was a master of Learning, that makes a good Instructor of others, as I shall ob∣serve on some other Occasions.</P>
<P>From Bridgewater, there is a Road to Bristol, which they call the Lower Way▪ the Upper Way, and which is the more
<PB REF="175"/>
frequented Road, being over Mendip hills. This Lower Way also is not always pas∣sable, being subject to Floods, and dan∣gerous Inundations, I mean, dangerous to travel through, especially for Strangers: All this Part of the Country, viz. be∣tween Bridgewater, and the Sea, and on Northward upon the Coast, lies low, and is wholly imployed in breeding and feed∣ing of Cattle, as are also the Moors, or Marsh Grounds, which extend themselves up the Rivers Perrot, and Ivill, into the Heart of the Country; of which in its Place.</P>
<P>This Low Part of the Country, be∣tween Bridge-water and Bristol, suffered exceedingly in that terrible Inundation of the Sea, which was occasioned by the Vio∣lence of the Wind in the great Storm, Anno 1703. and the Country People have set up marks upon their Houses and Trees, with this Note upon them, Thus high the Waters came in the great Storm: Thus far the great Tide flowed up in the last violent Tempest, and the like.</P>
<P>And in one Place they shewed us, where a Ship was, by the Force of the Water, and the Rage of the Tempest, driven up upon the Shore, several hund∣red Yards from the ordinary high Water Mark, and was left in that surprizing Con∣dition upon dry Land.</P>
<P>As this Country is all a grazing, rich, feeding Soil, so a great Number of large Oxen are fed here, which are sent up to London; so that now we come into the Reach of my former Observation, viz. That every County furnishes something for the Supply of London, and no County in England furnishes more effectual Pro∣visions, nor, in Proportion, a greater value than this. These Supplies are in Three Articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. Far Oxen (as above) as large, and good, as any in England.</P>
<P N="2">2. Large Cheddar Cheese, the greatest, and best of kind in England.</P>
<P N="3">3. Colts bred in great Numbers in the Moors, and sold into the Northern Coun∣ties, where the Horse Copers, as they are called, in Staffordshire, and Leicestershire, buy them again and fell them at London for Carr Horses, and Coach Horses, the Breed being very large.</P>
<P>As the low Part of this County is thus imployed in grazing and feeding Cattle▪ so all the rest of this large extending Country is imployed in the Woollen Ma∣nufactures, and in the best, and most pro∣fitable Part of it, viz.</P>
<P>In Taunton, The Serges, Druggets, &amp;c. and several other kinds of Stuffs.</P>
<P>In Wells, Shepton, Glastenbury, &amp;c. Knitting of Stockings, principally for the Spanish Trade.</P>
<P>In Bristol, and many Towns on the Somersetshire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> de—Druggets Canta∣loons, and other Stuffs.</P>
<P>In Froom, Philips-Norton, and all the Country bordering upon Wiltshire, Fine Spanish Medley Cloths, especially on that Part of the County from Wincanton, and Meer, to Warminster, Bruton, Castlecary, Temple Comb, down to Gillingham, and Shaftsbury, in Dorsetshire.</P>
<P>I mention this at lage, because this Trade of fine Spanish Medley Cloth, be∣ing the mix'd Colours and Cloths, with which all the Gentlemen and Persons of any Fashion in England, are clothed, and vast Quantities of which are exported to all Parts of Europe, is so very consider∣able, so vast an Advantage to England, maintains and supports so many poor Fa∣milies, and makes so many rich ones, that no Man can be just in the Descripti∣on of Things, and in a Sarv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of this Part of England, and nor enter into a parti∣cular Description of it; the above you may take as an Introduction to it, only I shall add but a little more, concerning this County of Some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>set, and shall, upon my entering into the North west and West Parts of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire, where the Center of this Prodigy of a Trade is sum it all up together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew you the Extent of Land which it spreads itself upon, and give you Room, at least, to make some
<PB REF="176"/>
Guess at the Numbers of poor People, who are sustain'd and inrich'd by it.</P>
<P>But I must first go back again a little while into Somersetshire: The Northern Part of the County, I did not visit in this Journey, which, as I hinted before, is only a Return from my long Travel to the Land's End. In omitting this Part, I, of course, leave the Two Cities of Bristol and Bath, and that high Part of the Country called Mendip Hall, to my next Western Journey, which will in∣clude all the Counties due West from London; for these now spoken of▪ though ordinarily called the West Country, are rather N. W. than West.</P>
<P>But as I made a little Trip from Bridgewater North, into the Body of the County, I must take Notice of what I observed in that Part of it: The first Place I came to was Glastonbury, where, indeed, the venerable Marks of Antiquity, however I have declin'd the Observation of them, struck me with some unusual Awe, and I resolved to hear all that could be told me upon that Subject; and first they told me (for there are two Piecee of Antiquiry, which were to be inquired of in this Place) that K. Arthur was buried here, and that his Coffin had been found here.</P>
<P>Secondly, That Joseph of Arimathea was here, and that when he fix'd his Staff in the Ground, which was on Christmas Day, it immediately took Root, budded, put forth White thorn Leaves, and the next Day, was in full Blossom, white as a Sheet, and that the Plant is preserved, and blows eve∣ry Christmas Day, as at first, to this very Day.</P>
<P>I took all this <HI>ad Reserendum,</HI> but took Guides afterward, to see what De∣monstrations there could be given of all these Things; they went over the Ru∣ins of the Place with me, telling me, which Part every particular Piece of Building had been; and as for the White∣thorn, they carried me to a Gentleman's Garden in the Town, where it was pre∣served, and I brought a Piece of it away in my Hat, but took it upon their Hon∣our, that it really does blow in such Manner, as above, on Christmas Day. However it must be confsss'd, that it is universally attested.</P>
<P>Where I had the sight of the White∣thorn Tree, I obtained a sight of Mr. Cambden, and his Continuator, and was, first, a little concern'd, that a Person of Mr. Cambden's Judgment, gave such an Account of the Legendary Part of the History of this Place, with a Taste of his crediting the whole Story; and from him I began to believe also, that Joseph of Arimathea, was really here, and that the Christian Religion was preached in this Island within 37 Years after the death of our Saviour.</P>
<P>This, however, prompted me to far∣ther Inquiry, and the following Account occur'd, which is to be found, as they say, in the Manuscript History of the Church of Glastenbury, now deposited in the Cottonian Library, and taken from it by Mr. Dugdale, in his Mona∣sticon. Fol. 1, 2.</P>

<HEAD>Glastonbury Monastery in Somersetshire, of the Order of St. Benedict.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Year 31 after the Passion of our Lord, Twelve of St. Philip the Apostle's Disciples (the chief of whom was Joseph of Arimathea) came into this Country, and Preached the Chris∣tian Faith to Arviragus, who refused to embrace it, and yet granted them this Place, with Twelve Hides of Land; where they made Walls of Wattles, and erected the first Church in this King∣dom, which Christ personally dedicated to the Honour of his Mother, and the Place for Burial of his Servants, as is said in the Manuscript History of the Monastery of Glastonbury in the Cot∣ton Library. These Twelve, and their Successors, continuing long the same Number, and leading an er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tical Life, converted a great Multitude of Pagans to the Faith of Christ. They being all, at length, dead and buried here, the most
<PB REF="177"/>
holy Men Phaganus and Diruvianus, co∣ming into these Parts, and baptizing King Lucius and his People, had the a∣foresaid Hides confirm'd to them and their Successors, the same Number of Twelve being kept up till the coming of St. Patrick, who instructing them in the Monastical Life, became their Abbot: After whom, the holy Fathers Benignus Kolumkil, and Gildas, led a most holy Life there. Next came St. David Arch∣bishop of Menevia, now called St. Da∣vid's, who added a new Chapel to the Church, dedicating it to the blessed Vir∣gin, and erected a rich Altar; and near the said Chapel, Joseph of Arimethea, and other holy Men, are said to have been buried. Tho' the Church was af∣terwards several Times rebuilt, this Place still remained under the former Consecration, and was held in such Ve∣neration, that Kings, Bishops, and all the greatest Persons, thought themselves happy in adding something to its Posses∣sions, or being buried with any small Parcel of its Earth. St. Dunstan, and other holy Abbots, always preserving the Number of Twelve Monks added to them several Clergymen, that sung well.</P>
<P>This Church, by Reason of its An∣tiquity, was by the English called Eald∣church, that is, Old Church; and the People of the Country about it, thought no Oath more sacred, than to swear by the Old Church; as being the first, and oldest Church in England, and held in such Veneration, that it was called a second Rome, for Sanctity; because, as Rome was honoured with a Multitude of Martyrs, so this Place was renowned for many Confessors.</P>
<P>This Island, in which this Church stands, was, by the Britons, first called Y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wyrtryn, that is, the Glass Island, by Reason of the River, as it were of the Colour of Glass, incompassing the Marsh. It was called an Island, because inclosed about by a deep Marsh. It was called Avallonia, either from the British Word Aval, signifying an Apple, as be∣ing full of Fruit Trees, or from Aval∣lon, who was once Lord of that Ter∣ritory. The Saxons gave it the Name of Glastingebury, that is, the Town of Glass. There are several Islands about this, all belonging to it, all which toge∣ther were reduced to make up the Twelve Hides above-mentioned▪ the Bounds whereof may be seen in Dug∣dale, p. 2. and 3. All the Places with∣in those Bounds enjoy all sorts of Im∣munities, from the first Times of Chris∣tianity, granted and confirmed to the Church of Glastonbury by the British, English, and Norman Kings.</P>
<P>This Church was the sacred Reposi∣tory of the Ashes of a Multitude of Saints, insomuch that, no corner of it, or of the Church-yard, is destitute of the same. There lie the Twelve Disciples (above-mentioned) of St. Philip the Apostle, with their Chief, Joseph of Arimathea, and his Son Josephus; also St. Patrick, the Apostle of Ireland; St. Benignus, Dis∣ciple to St. Patrick; St. Pin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us.

Many more Names of Holy Men and Women were lost by the burning of the antient Church, and Time has worn out the memory of a still greater Number.</P>
<P>Many Holy Relicks were also preserved in this Church. Of those relating to the Old Testament, Part of Rachel's Tomb; of the Altar on which Moses pour'd out Oyl; of his Book; of the Tomb of Isaiah; some Manna: Relicks of the Prophet Daniel; of the three Children delivered from the Fiery Furnace; six gilt Stones of the Pavement of the Temple, and some of the Gate. Relating to our Lord Jesus Christ: Some of the Linen he was wrapp'd in; two Pieces of the Manger; some of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old offer'd by the wise Men; five Stones <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Jordan, where our Savi∣our was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> one of the Vessels in which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> turned Water into Wine; of the Stones the Devil proposed to Christ to convert into Bread; Of the five Loaves with which our Lord fed five thousand Persons; Of the Place where he was trans∣figured; Of the Stone he stood on in the Temple; Of his Hair; Of the Hem of his Garment; and many more, too tedioos for this Place: Also Relicks of the blessed Virgin; Of St. John Baptist; Of the A∣postles; Of many Martyrs, Confessors, and Holy Virgins.</P>
<P>On this Account, Glastonbury was eve∣ry where held in the greatest Veneration; and, as has been said, the greatest Per∣sous coveted to be buried there; most of whose Names have been lost, and of some, mention has been made above.</P>
<P>A few Feet from the Old Church stood Two Pyramids; that next to the Church Twenty-six Feet high, on which were many Antiquities worn out by Age. On the uppermost Story of it, was a Ponti∣fical Image; on the Second, the Image of a King, with these Letters, Heri, Sexi, and Blisier; on the Third, were these Words, Wemerest, Bantomp, Wineweng on the Fourth. Hate, Wulfred, and Eam∣fled; on the Fifth, and lowest, an Image, and this Inscription, Logior, Weslicas, Bregden, Swelves, Hwingendes, Bera. The other Pyramid was Eighteen Feet high, and had Four Stages, on which was to be read, Hedde Bishop Bregored, and Breorward. What these Words signify is not known; but it is guess'd, they were the Names of the Persons deposited with∣in the Pyramid. So great was the Respect paid by our Ancestors to this Place, that they durst not utter any idle Words, nor so much as spit in the Church, or Church∣yard, unless compelled by the utmost Necessity, and even then with the utmost Reluctancy and Remorse: Neither durst any Man bring a Hawk, Horse, or Dog into the Church, because it had been often observed, that such as had been acciden∣tally brought in, immediately died. Even from foreign Countries the Earth of this Church yard was sent for, to bury with the greatest Persons; and it is reported, that even a Mahometan Sultan, having taken an English Gentleman in the holy Land, gave him his Liberty, upon Pro∣mise, that he would bring him a Gantlet full of that Earth, which was accord∣ingly performed, and the Gentleman re∣turning to Glastonbury, declared the same upon Oath.</P>
<P>As to the Burial of King Arthur, Mr. Cambden makes no doubt of it, and gives us from Giraldus Cambrensis, an Account how King Henry II. caused Search to be made for his Tomb, and before they had dug Seven Foot, they came to a great Stone, having a Cross of Lead on the Inside of it, and the subsequent Letters, or Inscription upon it, and in the follow∣ing rude Character; which the said Gir∣al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Cambrensis, Mr Cumbden says, was an Eye Witness of as well as of a Coffin of hollow'd Oak, which they sound by digging Nine Foot deeper than the Inscription, wherein were depos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the Bones of that ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Prince,</P>
<P><PB REF="179"/>
On the Top of a high Hill, near a Mile from the Town, stands an old Tower, which the People vulgarly call the Torr; what it was, we are not certain; but it made famous by one Thing in particular; that here King Henry VIII. caused Rich. Whitingus, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, to be hanged for refusing to surrender the Monastery.</P>
<P>I must confess, that I cannot so much blame the Catholicks in those early Days, for reverencing this Place as they, or, at least, 'till they came to found Idolatry up∣on their Respect, if they really belief these Things; but my Business is to relate, ra∣ther than Remark.</P>
<P>Four Miles from Glastonbury, lies the little City of Wells, where is one of one of the nearest, and, in some Respects, the most beautiful, Cathedrals in complete Draught of Imagery, very fine, and yet very antient.</P>

<P>The City lies just at the Foot of the Mountains called Mendip Hills, and is it∣self built on a Stony Foundation. Its Manufacture is chiefly of Stocking, as is mentioned already; 'tis well built, and po∣pulous, and has several good Families in it; so that there is no Want of good Company there.</P>
<P>Near this City, and just under the Hills, is the famous, and so much talk'd of Wo∣key Hole, which, to me, that had been in Pool's Hole, in the Peak of Derby, has nothing of Wonder o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Curiosity in it; the chief Thing I observ'd in th s, is, what is generally found in all such sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous Caverns; namely, That the Water drop∣ping from the Roof of the Vault, petri∣fies, and hangs in long Pieces like I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icies as if it would, in Time, turn into a Co∣lumn to support the Arch, As to the Stories of a Witch dwelling here, as of a Gyant dwelling in the other (I mean in Pool's Hole) I take them to be equally fabulous, and worth no Notice.</P>
<P>In the low Country, on the other Side Mendip Hills, lies Chedde a Village plea∣santly situated under the very Ridge of the Mountains; before the Village is a large Green, or Common, a Piece of Ground, in which the whole herd of the the Cows, belonging to the Town, do feed; the Ground is exceeding rich, and as the whole Village are Cow-keepers, they take care to keep up the Goodness of the Soil by agreeing to lay on large Quantities of Dung for manuring and in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iching the Land.</P>
<P>The Milk of all the Town Cows, is brought together every Day into a com∣mon Room, where the Persons appoint∣ed, or trusted for the management, measure every Man's Quantity, and set it down in a Book; when the Quantities are ad∣justed, the Milk is all put together, and every meal's Milk makes one Cheese, and no more; so that the Cheese is bigger, or less, as the Cows yield more, or less, Milk. By this method, the goodness of the Cheese is preserved, and, without all Dispute, it is the best Cheese that England
<PB REF="180"/>
affords, if not, that the whole World af∣fords.</P>
<P>As the Cheeses are, by this means, ve∣ry l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge for they often weigh a Hundred Weight▪ sometimes much more, so the poorer Inhabitants, who have but few Cows, are obliged to stay the longer for the Return of their milk; for no Man has any such Return, 'till his Share comes to a whole Cheese, and then he has it; and if the Quantity of his Milk deliver∣ed in, comes to above a Cheese, the over∣plus rests in Account to his Credit, 'till another Cheese comes to his share; and thus every Man has equal Justice, and though he should have but one Cow, he shall, in Time, have one whole Cheese. This Cheese is often sold for six Pence to eight Pence per Pound, when the Che∣sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Cheese is sold but for two Pence to two Pence Halfpenny.</P>
<P>Here is a deep, frightful Chasm in the Mountain, in the hollow of which, the Road goes, by which they travel towards Bristol; and out of the same hollow, springs a little River, which flolws with such a full Stream, that, it is said, it drives twelve Mills within a Quarter of a Mile of the Spring; but this is not to be un∣derstood, without supposing it to fetch some winding Reaches in the Way; there would not, otherwise, be room for twelve Mills to stand, and have any Head of Wa∣ter above the Mill, within so small a space of Ground. The Water of this Spring, g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows quickly into a River, and runs down into the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shes, and joins ano∣ther little River called Axe, about Ax∣bridge, and thence into the Bristol Chan∣nel, or Severn Sea.</P>
<P>I must now turn East, and South-East, for I resolved not to go up the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills of Mendip at all, this Journey, leaving that Part to another Tour, when I shall give an Account of these Mountains, as also of the Cities of Bath and Bristol, to which they are very near, all in one Letter.</P>
<P>I come now to that Part of the Coun∣try, which joins itself to Wiltshire, which I reserved, in particular, to this Place, in order to give some Account of the Brood cloth Manufacture, which I severa Times mentioned in my first Journey and which is carried on here, and that to such a Degree, as deserves a Places in all the Descriptions, or Histories, which shall be given of this Country.</P>
<P>As the East, and South Parts of Wilt∣shire are, as I have already observed, all Hilly, spreading themselves far and wide, in Plains, and Grassy Downs, for breed∣ing, and feeding, vast Flocks of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and a prodigious Number of ther<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: And as the West and North Parts of Somer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t∣shire are, on the contrary. Low, and Marshy, or Moorish, for feeding, and breeding, of black Cattle, and Hor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, or for Lead-mines, &amp;c. So all the South-west Part of Wiltshire, and the East Part of Somersetshire, are low and slat, be∣ing a rich, inclosed Country, full of Ri∣vers and Towns, and infinitely populous, insomuch, that some of the Market Towns are equal to Cities in Bigness, and superi∣or to them in Numbers of People.</P>
<P>This low, flat Country, contains Part of the Three Counties of Somerset, Wilts, and Gloucester, and that the Extent of it may be the easier understood by those who know any thing of the Situation of the Country, it reaches from Cire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster in the North, to Sherburn on the Edge of Dorsetshire South, and from the De∣vizes East, to Bristol West, which may take in about Fifty Miles in lenght where longest, and Twenty in breadth where narrowest.</P>
<P>In this Extent of Country, we have the following Market Towns, which are principally employ'd in the Clothing Trade, that is to say, in that Part of it, which I am now speaking of; namely, Fine Medley, or mix'd Cloths, such as are usually worn in England by the bet∣ler Sort of People; and, also, exported in great Quantities to Holland, Ham∣burgh, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Italy, &amp;c. The principal Clothing Towns in this Part of the Country, are these.</P>
<P>Somersetshire▪ Frome, Pensford, Phi∣lip's Norton, Bruton, Shepton Mallet, Castle-carey, and Wincanton.</P>
<P><PB REF="181"/>
Wiltshire. Malmsbury, Castlecomb, Chippenham, Calne, Devizes, Bradford, Trubridge, Westbury, Warminster, Meer.</P>
<P>Dorfershire▪ Gillingham, Shaftsbury, Bevister, and Bere, Sturminster, Shire∣born.</P>
<P>Gloucester, Cirencester, Tetbury, Marshfield, Minchinghampton, and Fair∣ford.</P>
<P>These Towns, as they stand thin, and at considerable Distance from one ano∣ther; for, except the two Towns of Bradford and Trabridge, the other stand at an unusual Distance; I say these Towns are interlpers'd with a very great Number of Villages, I had almost said, innumera∣ble Village, Hamblets, and scattered Houses, in which, generally speaking, the spinning Work of all this Manufacture is performed by the poor People; the Ma∣ster Clothiers, who generally live in the greater Towns, sending out the Wooll Weekly to their Houses, by their Ser∣vants and Horses, and, at the same time, bringing back the Yarn that they have spun and finished, which then is fitted for the Loom.</P>
<P>The increasing and slourishing Circum∣stances of this Trade, are happily visible by the great concourse of People to, and increase of Buildings and Inhabitants in these principal clothing Towns where this Trade is carried on, and the Wealth of the Clothiers. The Town of Frome, or, as is it is written in our Maps, Frome Sellwood, is a Specimen of this which is so prodgiously increased within these last twenty or thirty Years, that they have built a New Church, and so many New Streets of Houses, and those Houses are so full of Inhabitants, that Frome is now reckoned to have more People in it, than the City of Bath, and some say, than even Salisbury itself, and if their Trade continues to increase for a few Years more, as it has done for those past, it is very likely to be one of the greatest and wealthiest Inland Towns in England.</P>
<P>I call it an Inland Town, because it is particularly distinguish'd as such, be∣ing, not only no Sea Port, but not near any Sea Port, having no manner of Com∣munication by Water, no Navigable Ri∣ver at it, or near it. Its Trade is wholly Clothing, and the Cloths they make, are, generally speaking, all conved to London: Black well Hall is their Market, and thi∣ther they send up the Gross of their Clothing Product; and, if we may be∣lieve common Fame, there are above ten thousand People in Frome now, more than live in it twenty Years ago, and yet it was a considerable Town then too.</P>
<P>Here are also, several large Meeting-Houses, as well as Churches, as there are, generally in all the manufacturing Towns in England, especially in the Western Counties.</P>
<P>The Devizes is, next to this, a large and important Town, and full of weal∣thy Clothiers; but this Town has, late∣ly, run pretty much into the Drugget∣making Trade; a Business, which has made some Invasion upon the Broad-Cloth Trade, and great Quantities of Druggets are worn in England, as also, exported beyond the Seas, even in the Place of our Broad Cloths, and where they usually were worn and exported▪ but this is much the same as to the Trade still; for as it is all a Woollen Manufacture, and that the Druggets may properly be called Cloth, though narrow, and of a different make, so the makers are all called Clothiers.</P>
<P>This River Avon, a noble and large fresh River, branching itself into many Parts, and receiving almost all the Ri∣vers on that Side the Hills, waters this whole fruitful Vale; and the Water of this River seems particularly qualified for the Use of the Clothiers; that is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o say, for dying the best Colours, and for full∣ing and dressing the Cloth, so that the Clothiers generally plant themselves up∣on this River, but especially the Dyers, as at Trubridge, and Bradford, which are the two most eminent Cloathing
<PB REF="182"/>
Towns in that Part of the Vale for the marking fine Spanish Cloths, and of the nicest Mixtures.</P>
<P>From these Towns South, to War∣minster, the same Trade continues, and the finest Medley Spanish Cloths, not in England only, but in the whole World, are made in this Part. They told me at Bradford, That it was no extraordinary Thing to have Clothiers in that Country worth, from Ten Thousand, to Forty Thousand Pounds a Man, and many of the great Families who now pass for Gentry in those Counties, have been Originally raised from, and built up by this truly noble Manufacture.</P>
<P>If I may speak here from the Au∣thority of the ancient Inhabitants of the Place, and who have been curious Ob∣servers upon this Subject, the Country which I have now described, as princi∣pally imploy'd in, and maintained by this Prodigy of a Trade, contains Two Mil∣lions, Three Hundred and Thirty Thou∣sand Acres of Land, who has in it Seven hundred Eighty Eight Parishes, and Three Hundred and Seventy Four Thousand People. It is true, that this is all guess∣work; but I must confess myself very willing to believe, that the Reckoning is far short of the Account; for the County is exceeding large and popu∣lous.</P>
<P>It may be worth Enquiry, by the curious, how the Manufactures, in so vast a Consumption of the Wool, as such a Trade must take up, can be sup∣plied with Wool for their Trade; and, indeed, it would be something strange, if the Answer were not at Hand.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may reasonable conclude, that this Manufacture was at first seated in this County, or as we may say, planted itself here at first, because of the infinite Numbers of Sheep, which were sed at that Time upon the Downs and Plains of Dorset, Wilts, and Hampshire, all adjoining, as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding Town, is seated, or rises gradually▪ upon some large River because of the Benefit of the Navigation▪ and as Gentlemen place the Mans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ Houses of their Estates. and Seats <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Families, as near the pleasant Ri∣vers, Woods, and sine Prospects as pos∣sible, for the Delight of their Living▪ so the first Planters of the Clothing Ma∣nufacture, doubtless, chose this delight∣ful Vale for its Seat, because of the Neighbourhood of this Plains, which might be supposed to be a Fund of Wool for the carrying it on. Thus the Manu∣facture of white Cloth was planted in Stround water in Gloucester, for the sake of the excellent water there for the dy∣ing Scarlets, and all Colours that are dyed in Grain, which are better dyed there, than in any other Place of Eng∣land, some Towns near London excepted. Hence, therefore, we first observe, they are supplied Yearly with the Fleeces of two or three Millions of Sheep.</P>
<P N="2">2. But as the Number of Sheep fed on there Downs is lessened, rather than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because of the many thou∣sand Acres of the Carpet Ground being, of late Years, turned into Arable Land and sowed with Wheat; which, by the way, has made Warminster a Market Town, on the Edge of Somersetshire, as it now is, without Exception▪ the great∣est Market for Wheat in England▪ with this Exception only, viz. Where none of it is brought to send to London.</P>
<P>I say, The Number of Sheep, and consequently the Quantity of Wool, de∣creasing, and at the same time the Ma∣nufacture, as has been said, prodigiously encreasing, the Manufactures applied themselves to other Parts for a Supply, and hence began the Influx of North-Country Wool to come in from the Counties of Northampton, Leicester, and Lincoln, the center of which Trade, is about Tetbury and Cirencester, where are the Markets for the North-country Wool are sold every week, for the sup∣ply of this prodigious consumption.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="183"/>
3 From London, they have great Quantities of Wooll, which is generally called Kentish Wooll, in the Fleece, which is brought up from thence by the Farmers, since the late severe Acts against their sel∣ling it within a certain Number of Miles of the Sea, also Fell Wooll for the Combers, bought of the Wooll-Staplers in Barnaby-street, and sent back by the Carriers, which bring up the Cloths to Market.</P>
<P N="4">4 They have also, sometimes, large Quantities of Irish Wooll, by the way of Bristol, or of Mynhead, in Somersetshire; but this is uncertain, and only on extra∣ordinary Occasions. I omit the Spanish Wooll, as being an Article by itself.</P>
<P>Thus, in short, as those that see the Numbers of Sheep fed on the Downs and Plains, as above, and that see the Quan∣tity of Wooll brought to the Markets of Tetbury, and other Towns, and the Quantity sent from London, all into this One Vale, would wonder how it was possible to be consumed, manufactured, and wrought up; so on the other Hand, those that saw the Numbers of People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mploy'd, and the vast Quantity of Goods made in this Part of England, would wonder where the whole Nation should be able to supply them with Wooll.</P>
<P>And yet, notwithstanding the whole Country is thus imploy'd in the Broad-Cloth Manufacture, as above, I must not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to mention, that here is a very great Application to another Trade or Two, which I am obliged, by my first Scheme, not to forg t to mention, viz. The sup∣plying the City of London with Provi∣sions; though it is true, that the general <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mployment of the People in all this County, is in the Woollen Manufacture; yet, as the Spiuning is generally the Work of the Women and Children, and and that the Land is he exceeding rich and fertile, so it cannot be supposed, but that here are Farmers in great Numbers, whose Business it is to cultivate the Land, and supply the rest of the Inhabitants with Provisions; and this they do so well, that notwithstanding the County is so exceed∣ing populous, yet Provisions of all Sorts are very cheap, the Quantity very great, and a great Overplus sent every Day to London for the Supply of their Demand, which, as I said before, is great enough to exhaust a whole Nation.</P>
<P>All the lower Part of this County, and also of Gloucestershire, adjoining, is full of large feeding Farms, which we call Dairies, and the Cheese they make, as it is excellent good of its Kind, so being a different Kind from the Cheshire, being soft and thin, is eaten newer than that from Cheshire. Of this, a vast Quantity is every Week sent up to London, where, though it is called Gloucestershire Cheese, yet a great Part of it is made in Wilt∣shire, and the greatest Part of that which comes to London, the Gloucestershire Cheese being more generally carried to Bristol, and Bath, where a very great Quantity is consumed, as well by the In∣habitants of Two populous Cities, as also for the Shipping off to our West India Colonies, and other Places.</P>
<P>This Wiltshire Cheese is carried to the River of Thames, which runs through Part of the County, by Land Carriage, and so by Barges to London.</P>
<P>Again, in the Spring of the Year, they make a vast Quantity of that we call Green Cheese, which is a thin, and very soft Cheese, resembling Cream Cheeses, only thicker, and very rich. These are brought to Market New and eaten so, and the Quantity is so great, and this Sort of Cheese is so universally liked and ac∣cepted in London, that all the low, rich Lands of this County, are little enough to supply the Market; but then this holds only for the Two first Summer Months of the Year, May and June, or little more.</P>
<P>Besides this, the Farmers in Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire, and the Part of Gloucestershire adjoining, send a very great Quantity of Bacon up to London, which is esteemed as the best Ba∣con in England, Hampshire only excepted: This Bacon is raised in such Quantities
<PB REF="184"/>
here, by reason of the great Dairies, as above; the Hogs being fed with the vast Quantity of Whey, and skim'd Milk, which so many Farmers have to spare, and which must, otherwise, be thrown away.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for as the North Part of Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire, as well the Downs, as the V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the River Thames and, in some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laces, comes up even to the Banks of it; so most of that Part of the County being Arable Land, th y low a very great Quantity of Barley, which is carried to the Markets at Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gdon, at Farrington, and such Places, where it is made into Malt, and carried to London.

<P>Having spoken of what is m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st re∣markable, or at least, what most occur∣red to my Observation from the Land's End to Newbery in Barkshire, I must here take the Liberty to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ok round upon some Pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Times, which have made this Part of the Coun∣try more famous than befo e. 1. On the Hills on this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Devi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, is Roundway Down, where the Lord Wil∣mot, and the King's Forces, beat, and intirely routed, the famous Sir William Waller, in the late Rebellion, or Civil War; from whence this Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called, by some, Runaway Down <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Day. A little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earer towards Marlborough, is St. Ann's Hill, where, notwithstanding several high Hills between and the Di∣stance of twenty two Miles, or more, is a fair View of Salisbury Steeple, or Spire, which i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, without all Dispate, the h ghest in England. The Defe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of S r W ll am Waller, take in the few words of one of the most impartial Historians of those Times.—The Action was, in short, thus▪</P>
<P>Waller had always the Misfortune to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e beaten when he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Enemy to force a Fight. This was his Case now: He heard that the Lord Wilmor, with a Body of the King's Forces, were marched into the West to join Colonel Greenville: Sir Arthur S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inning, and the Loyal Troops in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Upon this he makes long matches to overtake, and intercept them, pretending to light them, join'd, or not join'd; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Wilmot advancing with 150<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Horse of the King's best troops, join'd the Wes∣tern Forces at the Devizes, and facing about upon Waller, met him upon Round∣way-Down,
<PB REF="186"/>
not far from St. Ann's Hill, mentioned above.</P>
<P>As I said, he who was seeking out his enemy, must himself be easy to be found, and therefore they soon came together; for though Waller seeing too late, that he was in an Error, would have been glad to have got off without fighting, yet seeing the King's troops advance in full march to attack him, boldly drew up in Order of Battle, and marched forward to meet them: Upon which ensued an obstinate, and very bloody Fight; for Waller was brave, and his Men had been enur'd to Victory, especially his Infan∣try, and though they were gallantly at∣tack'd by Colonel Slanning, and Green∣ville, the latter of whom was slain, yet they stood their ground, and could not be brokeu, but rather gain'd upon the Royalists: But the Lord Wilmot charg∣ing with an irresistable Fury at the Head of the Cavalty, the Rebel Horse were broken, and put into confusion, a body of Wilmot's Horse pushing them quite out of the Field: Lord Wilmot then falling with rhe like Fury upon the Rear of the Foot, while the King's Foot lay hard upon them in the Front. They were, at last, broken also; and, in a word, quite overthrown: And there being no way to escape the Horse, upon an open wild Down, as that is, they were most of them cut in Pieces, or taken Prison∣ers. All their Cannon and Baggage were also taken, with their Ammunition; and Waller himself, with great Difficulty, escaped. This was in the Month of August, 1643.</P>
<P>From this Action, as I said, this place was ever called Runaway-Down, instead of Rounway Down.</P>
<P>At Newbery there was another, or ra∣ther a double Scene of Blood; for here were Two obstinate, and hard sought, Battles, at two several Times, between the King's Army, and the Parliament's, the King being present at them both, and both fought almost upon the same Spot of Ground. In these Two Battles, said an Old experienced Soldier, that served in the King's Army, there was more Gene∣ralship shewn on both Sides, than in any other Battle through the whole Course of the War; his meaning was, That the Generals, on both Sides, shewed the most exquisite Skill in the managing, posting, bringing up, and drawing of their Troops; and as the Men fought with great Bravery on both Sides, so the Generals, and their Officers, shewed both their Bravery, and their Judgment. In the First of these Battles, the Success was doubtful, and both Sides pretended to the Advantage: In the Last, the King<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Army had apparently the work of it, and yet the King, in a very few Days, with a great Body of Horse, fetch'd off his Cannon, which he had, in the Close of the Battle thrust into Dunington Castle, and carried them away to Oxford, the Head Quarter of his A my, or his Place of Arms, as it would be called now; and this he did in the Sight of the victo∣rious Army, facing them at the same Time, with a Body of Six thousand Horse, and they, on the other Hand, did not think fit to draw out to attack him. That Retreat, in point of Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, was equal to a Victory, and gave new Cou∣rage, as well as Reputation, to the King's Troops. Indeed the Parliament's nrmy was out-General d in that Part; for as they had beaten the King's Army out of the Field▪ and obliged them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Train of Artillery and Carriages in the Castle, whioh was in itself a Place o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no great Strength; they ought immedia∣ly, even the same Night, to have invest∣ed the Place, and posted their Army so, as to cover the Siege; in which Case, the Cannon, and all that was in the Castle, had been their own; for though the King had indeed, a gallant Body of Horse, and superiot to the Parliament Cavalry by almost Three thousand, yet hit best Regiments of Foot had been roughly handled in the Battle, and some of them quite cut in Pieces; so that his Majesty would not have been in Conditi∣on to have attacked them in their Posts, in order to have raised the Siege.</P>

But this is not my Business: This Town of Newbery is an antient cloath∣ing Town, though, now, little of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art remains to it; but it retains still a manufacturing Genius, and the People are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enerally imployed in making Shalloons, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind of Stuff, which, though it be used <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly for the Lineing and Insides of Mens Cloaths, for Women use but little of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the Men for any thing but as above, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et it becomes so generally worn, both <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Home and Abroad, that it is increased <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a Manufacture by itself, and is more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onsiderable, than any single Manufacture <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Stuffs in the Nation.

<P>But the chief Reason of my making his Digression, is to mention, that with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Mile, or thereabouts, of this Town, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Place where the open Down Coun∣try begins, is Wey hill, where the great∣est Fair for Sheep is kept, that this Nati∣on can shew. I confess, though I once <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the Fair, yet I could make no Esti∣mate of the Number brought thither for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le; but asking the Opinion of a Grasi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who had used to buy Sheep there, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ldly answered, There were many hun∣dred thousands. This being too general, press'd him farther; at length he said, e believed there were five hundred ousand Sheep sold there in one Fair. Now, tho' this might, I believe, be too many, yet 'tis sufficient to note, that there are a prodigious Quautity of Sheep sold here; nor can it be otherwise, if it be considered, that the Sheep sold here, are not for immediate killing, but are generally Ewes for store Sheep for the Farmers, and they send for them from all the following Counties, Berks, Oxford, Bucks, Bedford, Hertford, Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, and Sussex: The Custom of these Farmers, is, to se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d One Far∣mer in behalf of (perhaps) Twenty, and so the Sheep come up together, and they part them when they come home. These Ewes have also this Property, that they generally bring Two Lambs at a Time. What Weathers are bought here, are car∣ried off by the Farmers who have feed∣ing Grounds, in order to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them for kil∣ling; but they are but few compared to the Ewes.</P>
<P>But to go back to Newbery: Not to insist upon the famous Jack of Newbery, who was so great a Clothier, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when King James met his Waggons lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Cloths going to London and inquiring whose they were, was answered by them all▪ They were Jack of Newbery's▪ the King returned, if the Story be true, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this Jack of Newbery was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her then he But not to insist upon this Man's St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y which is almost grown fabulous, yet a∣nother Story is Fact, and to be proved, viz. That this is one of the Two Legatee Towns (as they were called) in the Wall of the late famous Mr Kentick, who be∣ing the Son of a Clothier of Newbery, and afterwards a Merchant in London, left Four thousand Pounds to Newbery, and Seven thousand Five hundred Pounds to Reading, to incourage the Cloathing Trade, and set the Poor at Work, besides other Gifts of extraordinary Value to the Poor, as such. This Gentleman I shall have Occasion to mention again, and therefore I say no more now, only, that his E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igie, or Picture, was to be seen, before the Fire in 1666, in S. Christopher's Church in Thread Needle-street, London, where he is buried, and where the Benefact on
<PB REF="188"/>
he left for Prayers every Morning at six a Clock, Winter and Summer, in that Church, is still injoyed, and the Prayers performed there accordingly: As likewise, it is at Reading, and at Newbery.</P>
<P>This extraordinary Will is to be seen at large in Stow's Survey of London, to which I refer, and which it is well worth the Reader's while to look over, the like not being heard of in England, before. It seems he died a Batchelor, or, at least, without Children, and his Legacies, all in ready Money, cannot amount to less, than forty thousand or fifty thousand Pounds, besides what might be included in the ge∣neral Clause of leaving all the rest of his Estate to him who he made his universal Heir; which Estate, as I have heard, amounted to a very great Value. That forty or fifty thousand Pounds also, be∣ing considered at the Time it was left, might well be rated at four times the Value, as the Rate of Things goes now, it being in the Year 1624 What Im∣provement the Town of Newbery, or the Town of Reading, has made of the great Sums he left to their Management, that I did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot inquire into.</P>
<P>Near this Town of Newbery, the late <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Craven built a very stately Pile of Buildings for his own Dwelling, called Spine; but as it was never quite finished, so I do not understand, that his Lordship ever came to live in it, and, within these few Years, it was, by a sudden Fire, which no-body can, or no-body will, tell how it began, burnt down to the Ground. It was reported, the old Lord built this magnificent Palace, for such it was at a Time when he (slatter'd himself, at least, with Expectation, and) had Hopes of marrying Madam Royal, as she was then called, the Queen of Bohemia, Sister to King Charles I. who was then a Widow, and lived under the Shadow of the Eng∣lish Court; but being frustrated afterwards in that View, his Lordship went no far∣ther in his Building.</P>
<P>Here is was that the Vanguard, or first Line of the Prince of Orange's Army, was posted, when the Irish Dragoons, who were posted in Reading, finding they should be attacked in a few Days, had pu the Town's People into such a Fright, by threatening to burn and plunder the Town and cut all the Peoples Throats, that they sent express Messengers to the Dutch Ge∣neral Officer Grave Van Nassau for Help who sent them a Detachment of but Two hundred and Eighty Dragoons, though the Troops in the Town were near seven hundred Men. What Success they me with, I shall mention presently.</P>

Thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chief Trade is by this Water-Navigati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to and from London, though they h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> necessarily a great Trade into the Coun∣try, for the Consumption of the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they bring by their Barges fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> London, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oass▪, Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Grocery Wares, Tobacco, Oyls, and all heavy Goods.</P>
<P>They send form hence to London by these Barges, very great Quantities o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Malt, and Meal, and these are the Two principal Articles of their Loadings, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which, so large are those Barges, that some of them, as I was told, bring a Thou∣sand, or Twelve hundred Quarters o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Malt at a Time, which, according to the ordinary Computation of Tonnage in the Freight of other Vessels, is from a hun∣dred, to an hundred and twenty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dead Weight.</P>
<P>They also send very great Quantities <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Timber from Reading; for Berkshire be∣ing a very-well Wooded County, and the River Thames a convenient Conveyance for the Timber, they send most of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and especially the largest and fairest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Timber▪ to London, which is gene∣rally bought by the Shipwrights in the Ri∣ver, for the building Merchants Ships; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also, the like Trade of Timber is at He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

ley, another Town on the Thames, and at Maidenhead, of which by itself.</P>
<P>Here was a large Manufacture of Sail-Cloth set up in this Town, by the late Sir Owen Buckingham, Lord Mayor of London, and many of the poor People were, profitably (to them) imployed in; but Sir Owen himself dying, an his Son being unhappily killed in a Duel, a little while after, the Manufac∣ture died also.</P>
<P>There is, however, still a Remnant of the Woollen Manufacture here; I say <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Remnant, because this was once a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery considerable Cloathing Town, much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reater than it is now; and this Town, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s well as Newbery, and principally be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore Newbery, has injoyed the munifi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent legacies of that generous Merchant mentioned before, I mean Mr. Ken∣ck, who left them 7500l. to set the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor at Work, and encourage the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oathing Trade. How they manage <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Poor, that they can give the st Account of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den's Continuator, Dr. Gib∣son, says, there was once a Hundred and Forty Master - Clothiers in this Town; but that now, they are almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll gone. During the Civil Wars in England, this Town was strongly For∣ified, and the Remains of the Bastions, nd other works are still to be seen; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Royalists abandoning it after∣wards, it was possess'd by the Parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on after the Battle at Newbery.</P>
<P>There are three Churches, and two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge Meeting-houses in this Town, be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es that of the Quakers; and the Town, ambden calls it a little City, is said to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntain about Eight thousand People, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uding a little Hamlet at the Bridge over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Thames.</P>
<P>Here was once a most famous Mo∣stery, founded by King Henry I. young Son of William the Conqueror, who s buried in it with his Queen, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ughter Maud; of whom it was said, e was a King's Daughter, but herself Queen; this is made out, in that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was Daughter to Henry I. Wife to the Emperor of Germany, and Mo∣ther to King Henry II. so she was an Empress, but not a Queen. This Ab∣bey is now so demolished, that scarce any Remains of it are found, or the Place of it known.</P>
<P>As I have noted above, it was here that the Dutch with two hundred and eighty Horse and Dragoons, attacked the Forces of the late King James, in Aid of the distress'd Town's men, who they threatned to murder and plunder that very Day. It was on a Sunday morning, that the Irish Dragoons had resolved on the design'd Mischief, if they really in∣tended it: In order to it, they posted a Guard at the principal Church in the Piazza there, and might, indeed, easily have lock'd all the People in, and have cut their Throat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they placed a Company of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the Church-yard of another Church, over against the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that if they really did not in∣tend to massacre the People, as their Officers said they did not, yet that way of potting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the loud Oaths and Protestations, that they would do it, made it look as like such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as any thing unexecuted, or unattempted, could do.</P>
<P>In this Posture Things stood when the Dutch entred the Town: The Irish had placed a Centinel on the Top of the Steeple of the great Church, with Orders, if he saw any Troops advance, to fire his Peice, and ring the Bell; the Fellow, being surprized with the Sight, for he discover'd the Dutch but a little before they reached the Town, fired his Musquet, but forgot to ring the Bell, and came down. However, his firing gave the Alarm sufficiently, and the Troops in the Town, who were all under Arms before, whether for the design'd Execution, or not, I will not determine; but, I say, being under Arms before, they had little more to do, but to post their Troops, which they did with Skill enough, being commanded by Sir John Lanier, an experienced Officer, and Co∣lonel of a Regiment of Horse in King
<PB REF="190"/>
James's Army; and had the Men done their Duty, they might easily have re∣puls'd the few Troops that attack'd them; but the Dutch entering the Town in two Places, one by the ordinary Road from Newbery, and the other by the Broad Street near where the Horse-Fair is kept, forc'd both the Posts, and en∣tered the Market Place, where the main Body of the Irish Troops were drawn up.</P>
<P>The first Party of the Dutch found a Company of Foot drawn up in the Church-yard over against the Bear-Inn, and a Troop of Dragoons in the Bear-Inn-Yard, the Dragoons hearing the Dutch were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hand, their Officer bravely drew them out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Inn Yard, and faced the Dutch in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open Road, the Church-yard Wall being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Musquetiers to flank the Street▪ the Dutch, who came on full Gallop fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Dragoons, Sword in Hand, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> such irresistable Fury, that the Irish were immediately put into Confusion, and af∣ter three or four Minutes bearing the Charge, they were driven clear out of the Street. At the very same instant, another Party of the Dutch Dragoons, dismounting, entered the Church yard, and the whole Body posted there, fled also, with little or no Resistance, not sufficient, indeed, to be called Resistance. After this, the Dragoons, mounting again, forced their Squadrons, and entered the Market place.</P>
<P>Here, the Troops being numerous, made two or three regular Discharges; but finding themselves charged in the Rear by the other Dutchmen, who had by this time entered the said Broad Street, they not knowing the Strength, or Weakness of their Enemy, presently broke, and fled by all the ways possible, Sir John Lanier, having a Calash and Six Horses, got away with the first, though he was twice headed by a Dutch Trooper, who endeavoured to shoot one of the Horses, but miss'd his Shot, so the Colonel got away.</P>
<P>The Dutch having cleared the Town▪ pursued some of them as far as Twyford▪ and such was the terror that they were in, that a Person, from whom I had this Part of the Relation, told me, he saw one Dutch Trooper chase twelve of the Irish Dragoons to the River near Twy∣ford, and ride into the Water a good way after them; nor durst Sir John Lanier's Regiment of Horse, and Sir John Fenwick's, and a third, whose Colonel I do not remember, advanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to relieve their Friends, though they having had the Alarm, stood drawn up upon the Hill on Twyford side of the River, where they might see by what a contemptible Number their numerou Party was pursued; for there were no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above Five and Forty, or Fifty at most of the Dutch, that pursued about thre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hundred of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rish Dragoons to Twyford</P>
<P>Thus the town of Reading was de∣livered from the Danger they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> threatned with, and which they as reall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would rise. It is true, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> denied afterwards, that there was any such Design, or that they intended to offer the People any Violence; but it is as true, that several of their Soldiers confess'd it, and gave private intimations of it, to the People in the Houses where they quartered, especially some that had been kindly treated in their Quarters, and had a little Gratitude and Humanity than the rest.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to observe one thing here, to which I was an Eye-Witness, and which will resolve a Difficutly th t to this Day has puzzled the Under∣standings of a great many People, if not of the whole Nation; namely, That here began the universal Alarm that spread over the whole Kingdom (almost at the same Time) of the Irish being coming to cut every bodies Throats: The brief Account of which, because it has something curious in it, I believe will be agreeable to you. The State of it is thus:</P>
<P><PB REF="191"/>
As the terror which the threatnings of these Irishmen had brought upon the whole town of Reading, obliged the Magistrates, and chief of the inhabi∣tants, to apply to the Prince of Orange's Army for immediate help, so you can∣not doubt, but that many of the inha∣bitants fled for their Lives by all the ways that they could; and this was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Night; for in the Day, the Soldiers, who had their Eyes every where, stopped them, and would not permit them to stir, which still increased th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> terror.</P>
<P>Those that got away, you may be sure, were in the utmost Fright and A∣mazement, and they had nothing less in their Mouths, but that the Irish would (and by that time had) burnt the town, and cut the Throats of all the People, Men Women, and Children. I was then at Windsor, and in the very interval of all this fright, King James being gone, and the Army retreated from Salisbury, the Lord Feversham calls the Troops to∣gether, and causing them to lay down their Arms, disbands them, and gives them leave, every Man, to go whither they would.</P>
<P>The Irish Dragoons, which had sled from Reading, rallied at Twyford, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aving not lost many of their Number (for there were not above twelve Men killed) they mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hed on for Maiden <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swearing and cursing, after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldierly Manner, that they would burn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the towns where ever they came, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cut the Throats of all the People. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owever, whether it was, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought themselves too near the Dutch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Maidenhead, or what else was the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter, they did not offer to take Quar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs at Maidenhead, the town also being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of King James's troops, so they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arched on for Colebrook, blustering in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same Manner, of what they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when they came there. The town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Colebrook had Notice of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and how they had publickly threaten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to burn the town, and murder all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People; but, happily for thom, they had quartered there a Regiment of Scots Foot, of those Regiments which King James had caused to march from Scot∣land, to his Aid on this Occasion; and they had with them, as was the Usage of all the Foot in those times, two Pieces of Cannon, that is to say, Field-Pieces, and they stood just in the Market-Place, pointing Westward to the Street where these Gentlemen were to come.</P>
<P>The People of Colebrook applied im∣mediately to the Scots Colonel, whose Name I am very sorroy I cannot re∣member, because it is to his honour that I should mention i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and begged his Protection. The Colonel calling a Council of his Officers, immediately re∣solved, they would make good their Quarters, unless they received Orders from their superior Officers to quit them, and that they would des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the town from Plunder; and upon this, immediate∣ly the Drums beat to Arms, and the Regiment came together in a few Mo∣ments: It was in the Depth of Winter, and, by Consequence, was Night, and being a wet day, the Evening was ex∣ceeding dark, when some advanced Cen∣tinels gave Notice, that they heard the Drums beat the Dragoons March, at some distance upon the Road.</P>
<P>Upon this the Colonel ordered a Lieutenant, with thirty Musqueteers, to make an advanced Guard at the extreme Part of the town, and he was supported by another Party of forty Men, most Pikes, at a small Distance, who were to advance upon a Signal; and if these last should ingage, the Drums of the whole Regiment were to beat a March, and half the Battalion, to advance with the two Pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>It was near ten a Clock at Night before the Dragoons reached the town, when the two advanced Dragoons, which, by the discipline at that time, always rode at a distance from the Regiment, were challenged by the Centinels placed by the Lieutenant, as above; upon which they gave Notice to the Regiment, who immediately halted, and an Officer, with
<PB REF="192"/>
some Dragoons (they could not tell how many, because it was dark) came up, and demanded, Who they were that challenged) the Centinel called his Cor∣poral, and he the Serjeant, with three Files of Musqueteers, and they told the Officer what Regiment they belong'd to, and that they had Orders to stop any troops from entering the town, till their Colonel should be acquainted with it, and give farther Orders.</P>
<P>The Dragoons, as the Ground would admit drew up in Front, and their Of∣ficers began to huff and threaten, that they were the King's troops, and within the Line of the army; that they must have quarters in the town, and ought not to be refused by their own side.</P>
<P>By this time the Lieutenant came up also: He gave the Officer of Dragoons very good Words, and told him, He know too well what belonged to the Duty of a subaltern Officer, to blame him for doing his Duty; but that the Regiment was under Arms, and the Co∣lonel at the Head of them in the Mar∣ket-House, and he would immedi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly send to him for Orders, and doubted no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but that the Colonel would give them Quarters in the town. The Dra∣goons not satisfied with this civil Usage, threatened, swore, rag'd, and damning the Colonel, and the Regiment, though not present, said they would have Quar∣ters without asking Leave of any Man, and the Officer turning about to a Ser∣geant, bid him go back, and cause the Regiment to advance.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant told him calmly, He was sorry to see him act <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o; but if that was his Resolution, he was ready for him, and immediately called out to his Ser∣geant to give the Signal to the next Party to advance, and told the Officer of Dra∣goons, that if he stirred one Foot forward, or any of his Men, he would fire upon them immediately. The Forty Men ad∣vanced, and in two Minutes after, they heard the Drums of the Regiment beat the Scots March.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Dragoons halted again, and the Major of the Dragoons advanc∣ing to the Parlee, the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Foot, was also come up to the Lieutenant's Party, with the forty Men, and with the Colonel's Answer to the De∣mand of Quarters; namely, That if the Dragoons had any Orders in Writing from the General for quartering in the Town, or for marching that Way, he was very ready to give them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but if not, they were his Quarters, and he would defend them to the lest Man▪ and No body should come in there, especi∣ally at that Time of Night.</P>
<P>The Dragoons, however, insulted and menac'd the Major also, and that at such a Rate, that he gave Orders immediately to acquaint the Colonel with it, who in∣stantly advanced, in full March, with the whole Regiment, having about two hundred Links lighted to let them see the Way, the Night being exceeding dark</P>
<P>When the Dragoons saw this, and having no Stomach to engage▪ they de∣sisted; but raged and stormed at such a Rate, as I cannot express, and taking the Road to Stanes, swore, they should go thither, aud burn the Town, and kill Man, Wo∣man and Child.</P>
<P>Those Blusters were so loud, and the Fellows, by Nation, such as from whom it might be expected, as put the People of C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lebrook, the Fright they had been in for themselves being a little over, into a second Concern for their Neighbour∣hood at Stanes, and some of them shewed the Concern to be so real, that they sent Express upon Express to Stanes, to ac∣quaint the People there of their Danger, knowing there was, at that Time, only Two Companies of Foot, of Colonel Regiment, in the Town. When these Messengers came there, they found the Poople already alarmed by others, who had come from the same Town of Colebrook, in the first Fright, with the News, that the Irish were co∣ming to burn the said Town of Colebrook, and that, by that Time, they did not question but that they had done it, and they were surprized to hear now, that it
<PB REF="193"/>
was not done; but upon the arriving of these Messengers, bringing Word, that they had burnt Colebrook, but for the Assistance of the Scots Regiment; and that they were coming to Stanes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wore, they would kill Man, Woman and Child; it is impossible to express the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ternation of the People: Away they run <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Town, Dark and Rainy, and M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight as it was, some to Kingston, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me over the Heath to Hownflow, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford, some to Egham, and some to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the dreadful News; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y that time they reached those Places. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir Fears had turned their Story from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying, they would burn and kill, to they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> burned and killed, and were coming <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter you to do the like,</P>
<P>The same Alarm was carried by others <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Colebrook to Uxbridge; for thither <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dragoons were for marching at first; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thus, some one Way, and some ano∣ther, it spread like the Undulations of e Water in a Pond, when a flat Stone <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Surface: From Brentford <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kingston, and from Uxbridge, it came erally, and by different Roads, to Lon∣n, and so, as I may say, all over Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; nor is it wonderful, that it seemed be all over the Nation in one Day, ich was the next after this Beginning; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t gave Wings to the News, no Post <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id carry it as it fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w from Town to wn, and still every Messenger had two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cles with him. 1. Not that such and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Towns were to be burnt and plun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by them; but that they were alrea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burnt; and 2. That the Irish were at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Heels to do the like.</P>
<P>This, I think, is a clear Account of Alarm, and what can be more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Colebrook was not the Case, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re ever the Colebrook Men came, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were asked, If their Town was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I rode the next Morning to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> At Slough they told me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was burnt, and U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bridge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and I know not how many more, destroy'd; and when I came to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they told me, Maidenhead and Ok∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n were burnt, and the like. From thence I went to Henley, where the Prince of Orange, with the second Line of his Army, entered that very After∣noon, and there they had had the same Account, with the News of King James's Flight; and thus it spread every Way in∣sensibly. The Manner is too recent in Memory, to need my giving any Descrip∣tion of it.</P>
<P>My next Stage from Reading, was to Great Marlow in Buckinghamshire, which, though not in the direct Road, yet lying on the Banks of the River of Thames▪ is, in my Course, proper enough to be spok∣en of and is particularly worth Notice for several Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a Town of very great Embarka∣tion on the Thames, not so much for Goods wrought here, (for the Trade of the Town is chiefly in Bone Lace) but for Goods from the neighbouring Towns, and particularly, a very great Quantity of Malt, and Meal, is brought hither from High-Wickham, a large Market Town, about Miles off, which is one of the greatest Corn Markets on this side of England, and lies on the Road from London to Oxford.</P>
<P N="2">2. Between High-Wickham and Mar∣low, is a little River called the Loddon, on which are a great many Mills, and particularly Corn Mills, and Paper Mills; the first of these, grand and dress the Wheat, and then the Meal is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt to Mar∣low, and loaded on Board the Barges for London: And the second makes great Quantities of Printing Paper, and than▪ very good of its Kind, and cheap, such as generally is made Use of in printing o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r News Papers, Journals, &amp;c and smal∣ler Pamphlets; but not much si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or large, for bound Books, or Writing.</P>
<P N="3">3 On the River of Thames, just by the Side of this Town, though on the other Bank, are three very remarkable Mills, which are called the Temple▪mills, which are called also, the Brass-mills, and are for making Bisham Abbey Battery Work, as they call it, viz. Brass Kettles, and Pans, &amp;c. of all Sorts. They have first a Foundary, where, by the Help of
<PB REF="194"/>
Lapis Caliminaris, they convert Copper into Brass, and then, having cast the Brass in large broad Plates, they beat them out by the Force of great Hammers, wrought by the Water mills, into what Shape they think fit for Sale. Those Mills went on by the strength of a good Stock of Money in a Company or Partner ship, and with very good Success, 'till at last, they turn∣ed it into what they call a Bubble, brought it to Exchange Alley, set it a Stock-jobbing in the Days of our South-Sea Madness, and brought it up to be sold at one hundred Pounds per Share, whose intrinsick Worth was perhaps ten Pounds, 'till, with the Fall of those Things toge∣ther, it fell to nothing again. Their Trea∣surer, a Tradesman in London, failed, ha∣ving misapply'd about thirty thousand Pounds of their Money, and then, as it is usual where want of Success goes be∣fore, quarelling among themselves fol∣lowed after, and so the whole Affair sunk into a Piece of mere Confusion and Loss, which otherwise was certainly a very be∣neficial Undertaking.</P>
<P N="4">4. Next to these are Two Mills, both extraordinary in themselves, one for mak∣ing of Thimbles, a Work excellently well finished, and which performs to Admirati∣on, and another for pressing of Oyl from Rape seed, and Flax-seed, both which, as I was told, turn to very good Account to the Proprietors.</P>
<P>Here is also brought down a vast Quan∣tity of Beech Wood, which grows in the Woods of Buckinghamshire more plenti∣fully than in any other Part of England. This is the most useful Wood, for some Uses, that grows, and without which, the City of London would be put to more Difficulty, than for any thing of its Kind in the Nation.</P>
<P N="1">1. For Fellies for the great Carrs, as they are called, which ply in London Streets for carrying of Merchandizes, and for Cole▪Carts, Dust▪Carts, and such like Sorts of Voiture, which are not, by the City Laws, allowed to draw with shod Wheels, or Wheels tyr'd with Iron.</P>
<P N="2">2. For Billet Wood for the King's Pa∣laces, and for the Plate and Flint Glass Houses, and other such nice Purposes.</P>
<P N="3">3. Beech Quarters for divers Uses, particularly Chair-makers, and Turnery Wares. The Quantity of this, brought from hence, is almost incredible, and yet so is the Country overgrown with Beech in those Parts, that it is bought very rea∣sonable, nor is there like to be any Scar∣city of it for Time to come.</P>
<P>At Bisham, overagainst this Town, was formerly an Abbey, and the Remains of it are still to be seen there: The Estate belongs to the Antient Family of the Name of Hobby. Some of the Heads of this Family, were very eminent in for∣mer Days, particularly Sir William Hob∣by, and Sir Edward Hobby, the latter having been imployed by Queen Eliza∣beth in the most important Foreign Ne∣gotiations. Their Monuments, with those of their Ladies, and Sons, are now to be seen, and well worth seeing they are, in the little Church of Bisham. The S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of the Family, is now in Dor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etshire, where Sir Thomas Hobby is st ll living; but they are generally all brought hither, when they die, to be buried with their Ancestors.</P>
<P>A little higher, on the same Side of the River, is Hurley, an antient Seat of the Lord Lovelace, and that Family being ex∣tinct, it came, by the Daughter and Heiress, to Sir Henry Johnson of Black∣wall, near Ratcliff, who originally was only a Shipwright, or Master builder, at the great Yard and Dock there, of which I shall speak in their Place. This Lady left only one Daughter, married to the Earl of Strafford, and who now enjoys the Hurly Estate, in the Right of the ab ove marriagesof the Daughters.</P>
<P>There are two other Towns on the Thames, which I have already mentioned, viz. Henly and Maidenhead, which have little or nothing remarkable in them; but that they have great Business also, by the Trade for Malt and Meal and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m∣ber for London, which they ship, or
<PB REF="195"/>
load, on their great Barges for London, as the other Towns do.</P>
<P>And now I am, by just Degrees, come to Windsor, where I must leave talking of Trade, River, Navigation, Meal, and Malt, and describe the most beautiful, and most pleasantly situated Castle, and Royal Palace, in the whole Isle of Britain.</P>
<P>Windsor Castle, founded, as some say, by William the Conqueror, if there was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay thing in that Part, was at least re∣built, by Edward III. But the Truth of the Story is this, William the Conqueror did pitch upon it as a pleasant Situation, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a delightful sporting Country, and agree∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble to him, who delighted much in Hunting; and, as he says of it, a Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tted for the Entertainment of Kings, and therefore treated with the Abbot of Westminster for an Exchange, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook Possession of it. He also had seve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al little Lodges, or Hunting Houses, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Forest adjoyning, and frequently lodg'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Conveniency of his Game, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse which the Monks before injoy'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, or in the Town of Windsor, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Town is much more antient than the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astle, and was an eminent Pass upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hames in the Reign of the Saxon Kings: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to pass over the Antiquity or History <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Town, this is certain, That King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dward III took an extreme Liking to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Place, because of its beautiful Situa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and pleasing Prospect, which, in∣sed, is not to be out-done, in any Part <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Kingdom: Here, at length, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng resolved to fix his Summer Residence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself laid out the Plan of a most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnificent Palace, the same, as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tward Form and Building, as we now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it; for whatsoever has been done for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utifying, altering, or amending the In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Apartments, there has nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n added to the Building itself, except <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t noble Terras, which runs under the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth Front, and leads to the Green on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Park, at the East Side, or End of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng which East End, the fine Lodgings, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Royal Apartments, were at first built, the North-part being then taken up in Rooms of State, and Halls for publick Balls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The House itself was, indeed, a Palace; and without any Appearance of a Forti∣fication; but when the Building was brought on to the Slope of the Hill on the Town Side, the King added Ditches, Ramparts, the round Tower, and several Addenda of Strength; and so it was im∣mediately called a Castle.</P>
<P>The Pretence which some made to an old Story, that William of Wickham built this Castle, is a Story so evidently fabul∣ous, and so plainly detected, that the ve∣ry Relations which pretend to it, discover the contrary; owning, that the King was so incenied against him, but for a Suggesti∣on, that he had a Project of assuming the Honour of being the Founder, that it had like to have cost William all his Interest in the King's Favour, which, at that Time, was very great; and the Duke of Lan∣caster, who was his irreconcilable Enemy, took the Advantage of prompting the King to make that Suggestion; but he cleared himself by denying, that he ever made any Pretence to being the Founder, only put this Construction upon the Words, That the Money, and the Reputation he had gained by building the Castle tor the King, had been the making of him. The Words were these,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THIS MADE WICKHAM.</HEAD>
<P>These Words, they say, he had caused to be cut on a Stone in the inner Wall of the little Tower, which from him, is to this Day called Winchester Tower.</P>
<P>But to pass over this Fiction, this is certain, King Edward was the Founder of the whole Work, and the Plan of it was much of his own Contrivance; but he committed the Overseeing, and Direction of the Works, to William of Wickham, or, if you please, William of Wickham was the Sir Christopher Wren of that Court; for William was then a Layman, not having had a liberal Education, but had a good Genius, a mighty Lover of
<PB REF="196"/>
Building, and had applied his Head much that Way; nor, indeed, does the Build∣ing itself fail to the Head, or Master-Builder, a great deal of Honour; for in all the Decorations and Ornaments, which have been made since by the Princes who have liked Windsor best, they have found no Occasion to alter any of the Front, or to pull down, or build up, add, or di∣minish, except it be some small Matter at the Entrance to the great Stair-Case, the Kitchen, and Offices below Stairs, and the like; but the great North, and East Fronts, the Square of the inner Court, the great Gates at the entering from the Town, with the Round Tower, and the Walls annexed, are all standing in the ve∣ry Form in which King Edwad III. left them.</P>
<P>The only Addition in the Inside, is a fine Equestrian Statue of King Charles II. which stands over the great Well, sunk, as may be supposed, in the first Building, for the Supply of the Castle with Water, and in which was an Engine for raising the Water, not withstanding the great Depth, by very little Labour; the Contrivance and Performance done by the great Sir Samuel Morland, one of the best-natur'd Mechanicks of Time, and as good a Ma∣thematician.</P>
<P>On the Outside was added, the Terrace Walk, built by Queen Elizabeth, and where she usually walked for an Hour every Day before her Dinner, if not hin∣dered by windy Weather, which she had a peculiar Aversion to; for as to rainy Weather, it would not always hinder her, but she rather loved to walk in a mild, calm Rain, with an Umbrella over her Head.</P>
<P>This Walk was really a magnificent Work; for as it is raised on the Side of a Precipice, or steep Declivity of the Hill, so that Hill was necessarily cut down a very great Depth to bring the Foundati∣on to a Flat equal to the Breadth, which was to be formed above. From the Foun∣dation it was raised by solid Stone Work, of a vast Thickness, with cross Walls of Stone, for banding the Front, and pre∣venting any Thrust from the weight of Earth within. Then this Work was all to be filled up again within, after all that was first taken out, was thrown down the Front of the Hill, to push out the Precipices still farther, that it might be the same Slope from the Terrace, as it was before from the Foot of the Castle.</P>
<P>This noble Walk is covered with fine Gravel, and has Cavities, with Dreins, to carry off all the Water; so that let it rain as it will, not a Drop of it is seen to rest on the Walk, but it is day, hard, and fit to walk on immediately. The bread<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of this Walk is very spacious on the North Side, on the East-Side it is narrower; but neither at Versailles, or at any of the Royal Palaces in France, or at Rome, or Naples, have I ever seen any thing like it. The Gaand Seignior's Terrace in the outer Court of the Seraglio, next the Sea, is the nearest to it, that I have read of, and yet not equal to it, if I may be∣lieve the Account of those who have seen it; for that, I acknowledge, I have not seen. At the North-cast Corner of this Terrace, where it turns South, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on by the East-side of the Castle, there are Steps, by which you go off upon the Plain of the Park, which is kept smooth as a Carpet, and on the Edge of which, the Prospect of the Terrace is doubled by a Vista, South over the Park, and quite up to the great Park, and towards the Forest. Here also is a small Seat, fit for One, or but Two at the most, with a high Back, and Cover for the Head, which turns so easily, the whole being fixed on a Pin of Iron, or Brass, of Strength suf∣ficient, that the Persons who sit in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may turn it from the Wind, and which Way soever the Wind blows, or how hard soever, yet they may sit in a per∣fect Tranquility, and enjoy a compleat Calm. This is said also, to be Queen Elizabeth's own Invention, who, though she delighted in being abroad in the Air, yet hated to be ruffled with the Wind. It is also an admirable Contrivance for the Person sitting in it, to shelter himself from the Sun.</P>
<P><PB REF="197"/>
This lofty Terrace makes the Castle quite another Thing, and gives an Egress to the People within to the Park, and to a most beautiful Walk, which King Edward III. nor his Successors for some Hundreds of Years, knew nothing of, all their Prospect being from the Win∣dows of the Castle.</P>
<P>On that Side of the Building whish looks out upon the Terrace, are all the Royal Apartments, King Edward I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>I's were on the East Side. The East Side is now allotted to great Officers of State, who are obliged to attend when the Court removes to Windsor such as the Lord Treasurers, Secretaries of State, Lo d High Chancellor, Lord Archbishop of Can<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bury, and the like; and below they have proper Offices for Business, if they please to order any to be done there.</P>
<P>You mount into the Royal Apartments, by several back S airs; but the publick Way is up a small Ascent to a Flat, or ha f Pace (for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> love to make my Account speak English) where there are Two Entries of State, by too large Stair▪Cases, one on the left Hand to the Royal Apart∣ments, and the other, on the Right, to St. George's-Hall, and the Royal Cha∣pel.</P>
<P>Before the Entrance to these, on ei∣ther side, you pass throughout the Guard Chambers, where you lee the Walls fur∣nished with Arms, and the King's Beef-Eaters, as they call the Yeomen of the Guard, keep their Station, or as it may be called, their main Guard. These Rooms lead e ther way, towards the fine Lodgings, or towards St. George's Hall, which you please.</P>
<P>In the Royal Lodgings, there have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een so many Alterations of Furniture, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at there can be no entering upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articular Description. In one of those Lodgings, the late Queen Mary set up rich Atlas, and Chints Bed, which, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Times, was invaluable, the Chints eing of Masslapatan, on the Coast of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oromandel, the finest that was ever seen before that time in England; but the Rate of those Things have suffered much Alteration fince that time. Also here was, some time before that, the Picture of the late Dutchess of Ports∣mouth at full Length, a noble Piece, and of which 'twas said, King Charles II. should say, 'twas the finest Painting, of the finest Woman in Christendom; but our English Ladies of Queen Mary's Court, were of another Opinion, and the Gallery of Beauties, as it was called, which her Majesty placed in the Water Gallery at Hampton-Court, shews seve∣ral as good Faces, and as good Paint∣ing.</P>
<P>In the Chimney-Piece of one of these Apartments, is a Piece of Needle-work exquisitely fine, performed, as they say▪ by the Queen of Scots, during the time of her confinement in Fotheringay-Castle. There are several Family Pieces in the Chimney-Pieces, and other Parts of those Lodgings, that are valuable, because of the Persons they represent: But the fine∣ry of Painting is to come.</P>
<P>These Rooms look all out North to∣wards the Terrace, and over Part of the finest, and richest, Vale in the World; for the same Vale attending the course of the River Thames, with very little interruption, reaches to, and includes the City of London East, and the City of Oxford West: The River, with a wind∣ing, and beautiful Stream, gliding gently through the middle of it, and enriching by its Navigation, both the Land and the People on every side.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, that, as William the Conqueror expresses it in his Letter to the Monks at Windsor, it was a Place fit for the Entertainment of Kings, so it is; for it seems, by Nature, to be formed for a Palace; and for Delight, all Kinds of Pleasure and Convenience, that any Country, at least in England, can afford, are to be found here.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to say some∣thing to the Beauties and Ornaments of St. George's Hall, though nothing can
<PB REF="198"/>
be said equal to what the Eye would be Witness to; 'tis surprizing, at the first Entrance, to see at the upper End, the Picture of King William on Horseback, under him, an Ascent with Marble steps, a Balustrade, and a half Pace, which, formerly, was actually there, with Room for a Throne, or Chair of State, for the Sovereign to sit on, when on pub∣lick Days he thought fit to appear in Ceremony.</P>
<P>No Man that had seen the former steps, or Ascent, and had gone up to the Balustrade and Throne, as I had done, could avoid supposing, they were there still; and as on a casual View, having been absent some Years out of the Na∣tion, I was going forward towards the End of the Hall intending to go up the Steps, as I had done formerly, I was confounded, when I came nearer, to see that the Ascent was taken down, the Marble Steps gone, the Chair of State, or Throne, quite away, and that all I saw, was only painted upon the Wall below the King and his Horse; indeed it was so lively, so bright, so exquisitely performed, that I was perfectly deceived, though I had some Pretensions to Judg¦ment in Pictures too; nor was my Eye alone undeceived, others were under the same Deception, who were then with me.</P>
<P>When I came to the farther End, and look▪d from the Throne, as I called it, down the Hall, I was again surprized, though most agreeably, I confess, viz The Painting on the Side of the Hall, which was the Representation of Prince Edward's Triumph, in Imitation of Cae∣sar's glorious Entry into Room, and which was drawn marching from the lowet End of the Room, to the upper, that is to say, from the Door, which is in the Corner on the North Side of the Hall, was now wholly inverted, and the same Triumph was performed again; but the March turned just the other Way.</P>
<P>That this could be done no other Way, but by widing the whole Work out, and painting it all over again, was easy to conclude, seeing it was not done upon Cloth, but upon the mere Plaister of the Wall, as appeared by the Salts of the Lime in the Wall, having work'd out, and spoil'd a great Piece of the Paint; besides, the Nature of the Thing for∣bids, for if it had been a Canvas, turn∣ing it would have been impracticable, for then all the Imagery would have stood Heels up▪ unless it had been carried on to the directly opposite Part of the Hall, and that could not be, because there were the Windows, looking all into the Inner Court of the Castle.</P>
<P>The first Panting was done by Mr. Vartio, who, after finishing this Work, was entertained for 12 Years at Bur∣ley House, near Stamford, by that great Lover of Art, and particularly of fine Painting, the Earl of Excester: After which King William entertained him and, as they told me, he performed this se∣cond painting of the Hall, with greater Mastership of Hand than he had done the First: The Painting of the Cedings generally remain, being finished by the same Hand is a most exquisite manner at first.</P>
<P>At the West End of the Hall is the Chappel-Royal, the nearest and finest of the Kind in England; the carv'd work is beyond any that can be seen in Eng∣land, the Altar-Piece is that of the in∣stitution, or, as we may call it, our Lord's first Supper. I remember, that going with some Friends to shew them this magnificent Palace, it chanced to be at the Time when the Dissenters were a little uneasy at being obliged to kneel at the Sacrament; one of my Friends who, as I said, I carried to see Windsor▪Castle, was a Dissenter, and when he came into the Chapel, he fix'd his Eyes upon the Altar-Piece with such a fix'd, steady Posture, and held it so long, that I could not but take Notice of it, and asked him, Whether it was not a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="199"/>
Piece? Yes, says he, it is; but, whisper∣ing to me, he added, How can your Peo∣ple prosecute us for refusing to kneel at the Sacrament? Don't you see there, that though our Saviour himself officiates, they are all sitting about the Table?</P>
<P>I confess it surprized me, and, at first, I knew not what Answer to make him; but I told him, That was not a Place for him and I to dispute it, we would talk of it afterwards, and so we did, but brought it to no Conclusion, so 'tis needless to mention it any more here.</P>
<P>After we had spent some Hours in view∣ng all that was curious on this Side, we came down to the Dungeon, or Round Tower, which goes up a long, but easy, Ascent of Steps, and is very high. Here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were obsiged to deliver up our Swords, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no where else.</P>
<P>There is nothing curious here: The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overnor or Constable's Lodgings, are ery well, and neatly furnished, but no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing extraordinary, especially they will o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> look so, after seeing the fine Lodgings, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> above. From this Tower, you see St. aul's Cathedral at London, very plainly: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oming down from hence, we came into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other Court, where is the great Chapel <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Garter, and the House or College <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the poor Knights, as they are called.</P>
<P>The late Duke of Northumberland, who as Constable of this Castle, met with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry strange, and uncommon Accident in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming hither from Stanes in his Coach; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, as we call it in Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, the Night also very dark, and pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g by a Place where there are some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uses, tho' not a Town, and where the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad goes close to the River, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Coachman did not see the Water, or stook it for the Water in the Road, I ow not, but he plunged in the Horses, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach and all, into the River, and at a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce where the Water was exceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, and the Bank steep; so that if Help <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not come immediately from a Gentle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s House, which was close to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Servants crying our loud enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larm them, his Grace, and a Gentle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who was in the Coach with him, had unavoidably perished; and, as it was, he was a considerable Time under Water, so that he was in the Extremity of Dau∣ger.</P>
<P>I might go back here to the History of the Order of the Garter, the Instirution of which by King Edward III not only had its Original here, but seems to be seated here, as a Native of the Place; and that this is the Place where the Cere∣monies of it, the Instalments, Feasts, &amp;c. are always to be performed: But this is done so fully in other Authors, and by so many, that it would be falling into that Error, which I condemn in others, and making my Accounts be, what I resolv∣ed, from the Beginning, they should not be; namely, a Copy of other Men's Per∣formances. I shall only give you out of Mr. Ashmole, a List of the first Knights who had the Honour of this Order, and who have been succeeded by so many Kings, Dukes, and Sovereign Princes A∣broad, as well as Noble-men, and Peers of this Kingdom at home.

<P>It is true, these were not all Noble∣men, that is to say, not all Peers, nei∣ther does the institution confine the Or∣der to such; but 'tis certain, they were all Men of great Characters and Stations, either in the Army, or in the civil Ad∣ministration, and such as the Sovereign did not think it below him to make his Companions; for so they are ca led.</P>
<P>The lower Court, as I mentioned, of the Castle, thougt not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o beautiful, for the stately Lodgings, Rooms of State, &amp;c. is part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cular glorious for this fine Chapel of the Order, a most beautiful and magnificent Work, and which shews the Greatness, not only of the Court in those Days, but the Spirit and Genius of the magnanimous Founder. The Chap∣pel is not only fine within, but the Workmansh p without is extraordinary; nothing so ancient is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een very beautiful. The Chappel of St. Stephen's in Westminster Abbey, called Henry VIIth's Chapel, and King's College Chap∣pel at Cambridge, built by Henry VI. are fine Buildings; but they are Modern, compared to this, which was begun, as by the inscribed Dates upon the Works appears, in the Year 1337.</P>
<P>The Coats of Arms▪ and the various Imagery, &amp;c. even inside and outside, not only of the King, but of several of first Knights Companions, are most ad∣mirably finished, and the Work has stood out the injury of Time to Admiration; the Beauty of the Building remains with∣out any Addition, and, indeed, requiring none</P>
<P>'Tis observable, that King Edward owns this Chapel was begun by his Ancestors, and some think it was by King Edward I. and that he himself was baptized in it, and that there was a Castle built by Wil∣liam the Conqueror also: But to the Chap∣pel, which was then called a Church, or a Convent, King Edward III. did not pull down the old Building intirely, but he added all the Choir to the first Mo∣del, and several other proper Parts for the Purposes intended; as Houses and handsome Apartments for the Canons, Dignitaries, and other Persons belonging to the Church, which are generally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tuated on the North side of the Square, out of Sight, or rather screen'd from the common View by the Church itself, which Dwellings are, notwithstanding, very good, and well accommodated for the Persons who are Possessors of them; then the King finished it in the Manner we now see it: As for the old Castle, the Building of William the Conqueror, the King pull'd it ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely down, ev n to the Foundation, forming a new Build∣ing according to the present Plan, and which stood, as above, to the Time of King Charles II. without any Al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣ation.</P>
<P>The Establishment for this Chapel was very considerable, by the Donation of divers Subjects, before it was let apart to be the Chappel of the Order; the Duke of Suffolk in particular, as appears in Dugdale's Monasticon, gave near Three Thousand Acres, of Land Nineteen Man∣nors, One Hundred Seventy Messuages and Tofts, and several Advowsons of Churches to it, which, with other Gifts afterwards, made the Revenue above One Thousand Pounds a Year in those Days, which was a prodigious Sum, as Money went at that Time.</P>
<P>In the Choir are the Stalls for the Knights of the Order, with a Throne for the Sovereign; also Stalls in the mid∣dle of it for the poor Knights Pension∣ers, who live in their House or Hospital on the South side of the Square or Court which the Church stands in.</P>

<P>As the upper Court and Building are fronted with the fine Terrace as above, so the lower Court, where this fine Chappel stands, is walled round with a very high Wall, so that no Building, if there was Room for any, could over∣look it, which Wall goes round the West End of the Court to the Gate, which looking South, leads into the Town, as the Gate of the upper Court looks like∣wise S.

<P>The Parks about Windsor are very a∣greeable, and suitable to the rest; the little Park, which is so, only compared to the great Park, is above three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> round, the great one fourteen, and the Forest above thirty: This Park is par∣ticular to the Court, the other are open for Riding, Hunting, and taking the Air any Gentlemen that pleases.</P>
<P>The Lodges in those Parks, are no more Lodges, tho' they retain the Name, but Palaces, and might pass for such in other Countries; but as they be eclips∣ed by the Palace itself, so it need only be added. That those Lodges are prin∣cipally beautified by the Grandeur of the Persons to whom the Post of Rang∣ers have been assigned, who having been inriched by other Advancements, Hon∣ours and profitable Employments, thought nothing too much to lay out to beau∣tify their Apartments, in a Place, which it was so much to their Honour, as well as Conveniency, to reside; such is the Lodge, which belongs to Admiral Churchi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, the Dutchess of Marlborough and others.</P>
<P>I cannot leave Windsor, without ta∣king Notice, that we crossed the Thames upon a Wooden Bridge, for all the Bridges on the River, between London and Ox∣ford, are of Timber, for the Convenien∣cy of the Barges: Here we saw Eaton College, the finest School for what we call Grammar Learning, for it extends only to the Humanity Clas, that is in Britain, or, perhaps, in Europe.</P>
<P>The Building, except the great School Room, is an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient, the Chappel truly Gothick; but all has been repaired, at a very great Expence, out of the College Stock, within these few Years.</P>

<P>In the lower School, the Children are received very young, and are initiated in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o all School-Learning.</P>
<P>Besides the seventy Scholars upon the Foundation, there are always abundance of Children, generally speaking, of the best Families, and of Persons of Distincti∣on, who are boarded in the Houses of the Masters, and within the College</P>
<P>The Number of Scholars instructed here, is srm 400 to 550; but has not been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder 400 for many Years past.</P>
<P>The Elections of Scholars for the Uni∣versity out of this School, is worth tak∣ing Notice of: It being a Time of Jubilee to the School.</P>
<P>The Election is once every Year, and is made on the first Tuesday in August. In order to the Election, there are depu∣ted from King's College in Cambridge, Three Persons, viz. The Provost of King's College for the Time being, with one Senior, and one Junior Poser, Fel∣lows of the same College. To these are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyned, on the Part of Eaton College, the Provost, the Vice Provost, and the head Master.</P>
<P>These calling the Schollars of the up∣per Class, called the Sixth Class, before them, and examining them in the several Parts of their Learning, choose out twelve such as they think best qualified, and these are entered in a Roll, or List, for the Uni∣versity. The Youths thus chosen, are not immediately removed from the School, but must wait till Vacancies fall in the said King's College, to make Room to receive them; and as such Vacancies hap∣pen, they are then called up, as they stand in Seniority in the said List, or Roll of Election.</P>
<P>When a Scholar from Eaton, comes to King's College, he is received upon the Foundation, and pursues his Studies there for Three Years, after which, he claims a Fellowship, unless forfeited in the Terms of the Statutes; that is to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, by Mar∣riage, accepting of Ecclesiastick Prefer∣ments, &amp;c.

<HEAD>JOURNEY V.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am now near the Center of this Work, so I am to describe the great Center of England, the City of London, and Parts adjacent. This great Work is infinitely difficult in its Particulars, though not in itself; not that the City is so difficult to be described but to do it in the nar∣row Compass of a Letter, which we see so fully takes up two large Volumes in Folio, and which, yet, if I may ven∣ture to give an Opinion of it, is done but by Halves neither.</P>
<P>However, be the Task difficult, as it is, yet it must be done; to be con∣cise and short, is absolutely necessary; to be plain and significant, as neces∣sary; I shall observe both, as near as I can.</P>
<P>London, as a City only, and as its Walls and Liberties line it out, might, indeed be viewed in a small Compass; but, when I speak of London, now in the Modern Acceptation, you expect I shall take in all that vast Mass of Build∣ings, reaching from Black-Wall in the East, to Tothill-Fields in the West, and extended in an unequal Breadth, from the Bridge, or River, in the South, to Islington North; and from Petersburgh-House on the Bank Side in Westminster, to Cavendish Square, and all the new Buildings by, and beyond Hanover-Square, by which the City of London, for so it is still to be called, is extended to Hyde Park Corner in the Brentford Road, and almost to Marybone in the Acton Road, and how much farther it may spread, who knows? New Squares and new Streets rising up every Day to such a Prodigy of Buildings, that nothing in the World does, or ever did, equal it, except old Rome in Trojan's Time, when the Walls were Fifty Miles in Compass, and the Number of Inhabi∣tants six Millions eight hundred thou∣sand Souls.</P>
<P>It is the Disaster of London, as to the Beauty of its Figure, that it is thus stretched out in Buildings, just at the Pleasure of every Builder, or Undertaker of Buildings, and as the Convenience of the People directs▪ whether for Trade, or otherwise; and this has spread the Face of it in a most straggling, confus'd Manner, out of all Shape, uncompact, and unequal; neither long or broad, round or square; whereas the City of Rome, though a Monster for its Greatness▪ yet was, in a manner, round, with very few irregularities in its shape.</P>
<P>At London, including the Buildings on both sides the Water, one sees it, in some Places, three Miles broad, as from St. George's in Southwark▪ to Shoreditch in Middlesex; or two Miles, as from Peterburgh House to Montague House; and in some Places, not half a Mile, as in Wapping; and much less, as in Redriff.</P>
<P>We see several Villages, formerly stand∣ing, as it were, in the Country, and at a great Distance, now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyn'd to the Streets by continual Buildings, and more making haste to meet in the like man∣ner; for Example, 1. Deptford, this
<PB REF="205"/>
Town was formerly reckoned, at least two Miles off from Redriff, and that over the Marshes too, a Place unlikely ever to be inhabited; and yet now, by the Encrease of Buildings in that Town it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf, and the many Streets erected at Redriff, and by the Docks and Building-Yards on the River side, which stand between both, the Town of Deptford, and the Streets of Redriff, or Rother∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> (as they write it) are effectually j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yn'd and the Buildings daily increasing; so that Deptford is no more a separated Town, but is become a Part of the great Mass, and infinitely full of People also: Here they have, within the least two or three Years, built a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e new Church, and were the Town of D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford now separated, and rated by itself. I believe it contains more People, and stands upon more Ground, than the City of York.</P>
<P>The Town of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slington, on the North side of the City, is in like manner joyn'd to the Streets of London, excepting one small Field, and which is in itself so small, that there is no Doubt, but in a very few Years, they will be intirely joyn'd, and the same be said of Mile▪End, on the East End of the Town.</P>
<P>Newington, called Newington-Butts, in Sur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey, reaches out her Hand North, and is so near joining to Southwark, that it cannot now be properly called a Town by itself, but a Suburb to the Borough, and if, as they now tell us is underwritten, St. George's Fields should be built into Squares and Streets, a very little Time will shew us Newington, Lambeth, and the Borough, all making but one South∣wark.</P>
<P>That Westminster is in a fair way to shake Hands with Chelsea, as St. Giles's is with Marybone; and Great Russel∣street by Montague-House, with Tot∣tenham-Court; all this is very evident, and yet all these put together, are still to be called London: Whither will this monstrous City then extend? and where must a Circumvallation or Communication Line of it be placed.</P>
<P>I have, as near as I could, caused a measure to be taken of this mighty, I cannot say uniform, Body; and for the Satisfaction of the Curious, I have here given as accurate a Description of it, as I can do in so narrow a Compass, as this of a Letter, or as I could do without drawing a Plan, or Map of the Places.</P>
<P>As I am forced, in many Places, to take in some unbuilt Ground, so I have, on the other Hand, been obliged to leave a great many whole Streets of Buildings out of my Line: So that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eally not stretched my Calculations, to make it seem bigger than it is; nor is there any Oc asion of it.</P>

<P>N. B. The Town of Greenwich, which may, indeed, be said to be contiguous to Deptford, might be also called a Part of this Measurement; but I omit it as I have the Towns of Chelsea and Knights bridge on the other Side, tho' both may be said to joyn the Town, and in a very few Years will certain∣ly do so.</P>
<P>Were it possible to reduce all these Buildings to a compact Situation, 'tis ge∣nerally thought, that the whole Body so put together, allowing the necessary Ground, which they now employ for the several Trades in the Out-parts▪ such as the Building Yards by the River, for Shipwrights, Tanners Yards, Dyers, Whits∣ters, &amp;c. I say, 'tis believed the whole would take up Forty Eight Miles in Circumference, very compactly built.</P>
<P>The Guesses that are made at the Num∣ber of Inhabitants, have been variously form'd; Sir William Petty, famous for his Political Arithmetick, supposed the City, at his last Calculation, to contain a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of People and this he judges from the Number of Births and Burials; and by this Rule, as well by what is well known of the Increase of the said Births and Burials, as of the prodigious Increase of Buildings, it may be very reasonable to conclude, the present Number of Inhabi∣tants within the Circumference I have mentioned, to amount to▪ at least, Fifteen Hundred Thousand, with this Addition, that it is still prodi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ously increasing</P>
<P>Nor is it hard to account for this In∣crease of People, as well as Buildings in London; but the Discourse seems too Po∣litical to belong to this Work, which, rather, relates to the Fact than the Rea∣son of it and is properly to describe the Thing, not to shew why it is so, for which Reason I omit entring into the En∣quiry.</P>
<P>The Government of this great Mass of Building, and of such a vast collected Bo∣dy of People, though it consists of vari∣ous Parts, is, perhaps, the most regular

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A Brief Description of the new Buildings erected in and about the Cities of <HI>LONDON</HI> and <HI>WESMINSTER</HI> and Borough of <HI>SOUTH∣WARK,</HI> since the Year <HI>1666.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Account of new Buildings is to be understood.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of Houses rebuilt after the great Fire in London and Southwark,</P>
<P N="2">2. New Foundations, on Ground where never any Buildings were erected before.</P>
<P>Take, then, the City and its adjacent Buildings to stand, as described by Mr. Stow, or by any other Author, who wrote before the Fire of London, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Difference between what it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen, and what it is now, may be ob∣erved thus:</P>
<P>It is true, that before the Fire of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ondon, the Streets were narrow, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ublick Edifices as well as private, were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore crowded, and built closer to one nother; for soon after the Fire, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, by his Proclamation, forbid all erlons whatsoever, to go about to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ild for a certain Time, viz. till the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rliament (which was soon to sit) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght regulate and direct the manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilding, and establish Rules for the ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing every Man's Property, and yet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght take Order for a due inlarging of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Streets, and appointing the manner Building, as well for the Beauty as Conveniency of the City, and for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety, in Case of any future Accident; for though I shall not inquire, whether the City was burnt by Accident, or by Treachery, yet nothing was more cer∣tain, than that as the City stood before, it was strangely exposed to the Disaster which happen'd, and the Buildings look'd as if they had been form'd to make one ge∣neral Bonefire, whenever any wicked Party of Incendiaries should think fit.</P>
<P>The Streets were not only narrow, and the Houses all built of Timber, Lath and Plaister, or, as they were very pro∣perly call'd Paper▪Work, and one of the finest Range of Buildings in the Temple, are, to this Day, called the Paper Build∣ings, from that usual Expression.</P>
<P>But the manner of the Building in those Days, one Story projecting out beyond another, was such, that in some narrow Streets, the Houses almost touch'd one another at the Top, and it has been known, that Men, in Case of Fire, have escaped on the Tops of the Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, by leading from one side of a Street to an∣other; this made it often, and almost always happen, that if a House was on Fire, the opposite House was in more danger to be fired by it, according as the Wind stood, than the Houses next adjoining on either side.</P>
<P><PB REF="212"/>
How this has been regulated, how it was before, and how much better it now is, I leave to be judged, by comparing the Old unburnt Part of the City with the New.</P>
<P>But tho' by the New Buildings after the Fire, much Ground was given up, and left unbuilt, to inlarge the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treets, yet 'tis to be observed, that the Old Houses stood severally upon more Ground, were much larger upon the Flat, and in many Places, Gardens and large Yards about them, all which, in the New Build∣ings, are, at least, contracted, and the Ground generally built up into other Houses, so that notwithstanding all the Ground given up for beautifying the Streets, yet there are many more Houses built than stood before upon the same Ground; so that taking the whole City together, there are more Inhabitants in the same Compass, than there was before. To explain this more fully, I shall give some particular Instances, to which I re∣fer, which there are living Witnesses able to confirm: For Example.</P>
<P N="1">1. Swithen's Alleys by the Royal Ex∣change, were all, before the Fire, taken up with One single Merchant's House, and inhabited by one Mr. Swithin; whereas, upon the same Ground where the House stood, stands now about Twenty-two or Twenty four Houses, which belong to his Posteri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. Copt-Hall-Court in Throckmorton∣street, was, before the Fire, also a single House, inhabited by a Dutch Merchant; also three more Courts in the same Street, were single Houses, Two on the same Side of the Way, and One on the other.</P>
<P>The several Alleys behind St. Christo∣pher's Church, which are now vulgarly, but erroneously, call'd St. Christopher's-Church yard, were, before the Fire, One great House, or, at least, a House and Ware-houses belonging to it, in which the famous Mr. Kindrick lived, whose Monu∣ment now stands in St. Christopher's Church▪ and whose Dwelling, also, took up almost all the Ground, on which now a Street of Houses is erected, called Prince's street, going through into Loth∣bury, no such Street being known be∣fore the Fire.</P>
<P>King's-Arms-Yard in Coleman-street, now built into fine large Houses, and in∣habited by principal Merchants, was, be∣fore the Fire, a Stable-yard for Horses and an Inn, at the Sign of the Kign's-Arms.</P>
<P>I might fill up my Account with many such Instances, but 'tis enough to explain the Thing, viz. That so many great Houses were converted into Streets and Courts, Alleys and Buildings, that there are, by Estimation, almost 4000 Houses now standing on the Ground which the Fire left desolate, more than stood on the same Ground before.</P>
<P>Another Increase of Buildings in the City, is to be taken from the Inhabitants in the unburnt Parts following the same Example, of pulling down great old Build∣ings, which took up large Tracks of Ground in some of the well inhabited Places, and building on the same Ground, not only several Houses, but even whole Streets of Houses, which are since fully inhabited; for Example;</P>
<P>Crosby-Square within Bishopsgate, for∣merly the House of Sir Jamess Langham Merchant.</P>
<P>Devonshire - Square and Street, with several back Streets and Passages into Petticoat-lane one Way, and Hounsditch another Way, all built on the Ground where the old Earl of Devonshire had a House and Garden, and are all fully in∣habited.</P>
<P>Bridgwater-Square, and several Streets adjoyning all fully inhabited, built on the Ground where the Earl of Bridgwater had a large House and Garden in Barbican.</P>
<P>Billeter Square, and several Passages ad∣joyning, built upon the Grounds of one great House▪ in which, before that, one Merchant only lived.</P>
<P>All those Palaces of the Nobility, formerly making a most Beautiful Range of Buildings fronting the Strand, with their Gardens reaching to the Thames, where they had their particular Water∣gates
<PB REF="213"/>
and Stairs, one of which remains still, viz. York House, have had the same Fate, such as Essex, Norfolk, Salisbury, Worcester, Exceter, Hungerford, and York Houses; in the Place of which, are now so many noble Streets and beautiful Hou∣ses, erected, as are, in themselves, equal to a lage City, and extend from the Tem∣ple to Northumberland House; Somerset-House and the Savoy, only intervening; and the latter of these may be said to be, not a House, but a little Town, being parted into innumerable Tenements and Apartments.</P>
<P>Many other great Houses have, by the Example of these, been also built into Streets, as Hatton-House in Holborn, and the old Earl of Bedford's great Garden, called New Convent Garden; but those I omit, because built before the Year 1666; but I may add the Lord Brook's House in Holborn; the Duke of Bedford's last re∣maining House and Garden in the Strand, and many others.</P>
<P>These are prodigious Enlargements to the City, even upon that which I call In∣habited Ground, and where infinite Num∣bers of People now live, more than lived upon the same Spot of Ground before.</P>
<P>But all this is a small Matter compared to the New Foundations raised within that Time, in those which we justly call the Out Parts: and not to enter on a particu∣lar Description of the Buildings, I shall only take Notice of the Places where such Enlargements are made; as, first, within the Memory of the Writer hereof, all those numberless Ranges of Building, cal∣led Spittle Fields, reaching form Spittle∣yard, at Northern Fallgate, and from Artillery Lane in Bishopsgate-street, with all the New Streets, beginning at Hox∣ton, and the back of Shoreditch Church, North, and reaching to Brick-Lane, and to the End of Hare-street, on the Way to Bethnal Green, East; then sloping a∣way quite to White Chappel Road, South East, containing, by good Observation, above Three hundred and Twenty Acres of Ground, which are all now close built, and well inhabited with an infinite Num∣ber of People, I say, all these have been built new from the Ground, since the Year 1666.</P>
<P>The Lanes were deep, dirty, and un∣frequented, that Part now called Spittle∣fields-Market, was a Field of Grass with Cows feeding on it, since the Year 1670. The Old Artillery Ground (where the Parliament Listed their first Soldiers a∣gainst the King) took up all those long Streets, leading out of Artillery Lane to Spittle-yard-back-gate, and so on to the End of Wheeler-street.</P>
<P>Brick-lane, which is now a long well∣pav'd Street, was a deep dirty Road, fre∣quented chiefly by Carts fetching Bricks that Way into White Chapel from Brick-Kilns in those Fields, and had its Name on that Account; in a Word, it is com∣puted, that above Two Hundred Thou∣sand Inhabitants dwell now in that Part of London, where, within about Fifty Years past, there was not a House stand∣ing.</P>
<P N="2">2. On the more Eastern Part, the same Increase goes on in Proportion, namely, all Goodman's Fields, the Name gives Evidence for it, and the many Streets be∣tween White-Chapel and Rosemary Lane, all built since the Year 1678. Well Close, now called Marine-sqare, was so remote from Houses, that it used to be a very danderous Place to go over after it was dark, and many People have been robbed and abused in passing it; a Well stand∣ing in the middle, just where the Danish Church is now built, there the Mischief was generally done; beyond this, all the hither or West End of Ratcliff-high-way, from the Corner of Gravel-Lane, to the East End of East Smith-field, was a Road over the Fields; likewise those Buildings, now called Virginia-street, and all the Streets on the Side of Ratcliff-high-way to Gravel-lane above named.</P>
<P N="3">3. To come to the North Side of the Town, and beginning at Shoreditch, west, and Hoxton-square, and Charles's-square adjoyning, and the Streets intended for a Market-Place, those were all open Fields, from Anniseed-clear to Hoxton Town,
<PB REF="214"/>
till the Year 1689, or thereabouts; Pit∣field street, was a Bank, parting Two Pasture Grounds, and Ask's Hospital was another open field: Farther West, the like Addition of Building begins at the foot way, by the Pest-house, and includes the French Hospital, Oldstreet Two Squares, and several streets, extending from Brick Lane to Mount Mill, and the Road to Islington, and from that Road, still West, to Wood's Close, and to St. John's, and Clerkenwell, all which streets and squares are built since the Year 1688 and 1689, and were before that, and some for a long Time after, open fields or Gar∣dens, and never built on till after that Time.</P>
<P>From hence we go on still West, and beginning at Gray's-Inn▪ and going on to those formerly called Red-Lyon Fields, and Lamb's Conduit Fields, we see there a prodigious Pile of Buildings; it begins at Gray's Inn Wall towards Red Lyon∣street, from whence, in a strait Line, 'tis built quite to Lamb's Conduit Fields, North, including a great Range of Build∣ings yet unfinish'd, reaching to Bedford Row and the Cockpit, East, and includ∣ing Red Lyon Square, Ormond-street, and the great New Square at the West End of it, and all the streets between that Square and King's Gate in Hol∣born, where is goes out; this Pile of Buildings is very great, the Houses so magnificent and large, that abundance of Persons of Quality, and some of the Nobility are found among them, parti∣cularly in Ormond-street, is the D—of Powis's House, built at the Expence of France, on Account of the former House being burnt, while the Duke D' Aumont, the French Ambassador Extra∣ordinary lived in it; it i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now a very noble Structure, tho' not large, built of Free-Stone, and in the most exact man∣ner, according to the Rules of Architec∣ture, and is said to be, next the Banquet∣ting House, the most regular Building in this Part of England.</P>
<P>Here is also a very convenient Church, built by the Contribution of the Gentry inhabitants of these Buildings, tho' not yet made Parochial, being called St. George's Chapel.</P>
<P>Farther West, in the same Line, is Southampton great Square, called Blooms∣bury, with King-street on the East side of it, and all the numberless streets West of the Square, to the Market Place, and through Great Russel street by Mon∣tague House, quite into the Hampstead Road, all which Buildings, except the old Building of Southampton House and some of the Square, has been form'd from the open Fields, since the Time above mentioned, and must contain seve∣ral Thousands of Houses; here is also a Market, and a very handsome Church new built.</P>
<P>From hence, let us view the Two great Parishes of St. Giles's and St. Mar∣tin's in the fields, the last so increased, as to be above 30 Years ago, formed in∣to Three Parishes, and the other about now to be divided also.</P>
<P>The increase of the Buildings here, is really a kind of Prodigy; all the Build∣ings North of Long Acre, up to the Se∣ven Dials, all the streets, from Leicester Fields and St. Martin's Lane, both North and West, to the Hay Market and Soho, and from the Hay Market to St. James's street inclusive, and to the Park Wall; then all the Buildings on the North side of the street, called Piccadilly, and the Road to Knights Bridge, and between that and the south side of Tyburn Road, including Soho square, Golden square, and now Hanover square, and that new City on the North side of Tyburn Road, called Cavendish square, and all the streets about it.</P>
<P>This last Addition, is by Calculation, more in Bulk than the Cities of Bristol, Exeter and York, if they were all put together; all which Places were, within the Time mentioned, meer fields of Grass, and employ'd only to feed Cattle as other fields are.</P>
<P><PB REF="215"/>
The many little Additions that might be named besides these, tho' in them∣selves considerable, yet being too many to give Room to here, I omit.</P>
<P>This is enough to give a view of the Difference between the present and the Greatness of this mighty City, called London.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Three Projects have been thought of, for the better regulating the Form of this mighty Building, which tho' not yet brought to Per∣fection, may perhaps, in Time, be brought forwards, and if it should, would greatly add to the Beauty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Making another Bridge over the Thames.</P>
<P N="2">2. Making an Act of Parliament, a∣brogating the Names as well as the Ju∣risdictions of all the petty privileged Places, and joining or uniting the whole Body, Southwark and all, into One City, and calling it by one Name, LONDON.</P>
<P N="3">3. Forbidding the Extent of the Build∣ings in some particular Places, where they too much run it out of Shape, and letting the more indented Parts swell out on the North and South side a little, to balance the Length, and bring the Form of the whole more near to that of a Circle, as particularly stopping the running out of the Buildings at the East and West Ends, as at Ratcliff and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> East, and at Tyburn and Ken∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ton Roads, West, and encouraging the Buildings out at Moor-fields, Bun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il fields, the West side of Shoreditch, and such Places, and the North Part of Gray's Inn, and other adjacent Places, where the Buildings are not equally fil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed out, as in other Places, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke in St. George's Fields and be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind Redriff on the other side of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ater.</P>
<P>But these are speculations only, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust be left to the Wisdom of future <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges. I return now, to some short De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ription of the Parts; hitherto I have been upon the Figure and Extent of the City and its Out-Parts; I come now to speak of the inside, the Buildings, the Inhabitants, the Commerce, and the manner of its Government, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It should be observed, that the City being now rebuilt, has occasioned the building of some Publick Edifices even in the Place which was inhabited, which yet were not before, and the re-building others in a new and more magnificent manner than ever was done before.</P>
<P N="1">1. That beautiful Column, called the Monument, erected at the Charge of the City, to perpetuate the fatal Burn∣ing of the Whole, cannot be mentioned but with some due Respect to the Build∣ing itself, as well as to the City; it is Two hundred and Two Feet high, and in its Kind, out does all the Obelisks and Pillars of the Ancients, at least that that I have seen, having a most stupen∣dous Stair-Case in the middle to mount up to the Balcony, which is about Thir∣ty Feet short of the Top, and whence there are other steps made even to look out at the Top of the whole Building; the Top is fashioned like an Um.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Canal or River, called Fleet∣ditch, was a Work of great Magnifi∣cence and Expence; but not answering the Design, and being now very much neglected, and out of Repair, is not much spoken of, yet it has Three fine Bridges over it, and a Fourth, not so fine, yet use<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul as the rest, and the Tide flowing up to the last; the Canal is very useful for bringing of Coals and Timber, and other heavy Goods; but the Warehouses intended under the streets, on either side, to lay up such Goods in, are not made Use of, and the Wharfs in many Places are decay'd and fallen in, which make all look Ruinous.</P>
<P>The Royal Exchange, the greatest and finest of tho Kind in the World, is the next publick Work of the Citizens, the Beauty of which answers for itself, and needs no Description here; 'tis observ∣able, that tho' this Exchange cost the Citizens an immense Sum of Money <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

building▪ some Authors say, Eighty Thou∣sand Pounds, being finished and embellish∣ed in so exquisite a Manner, yet it was so appropriated to the grand Affair of Busi∣ness, that the Rent or Income of it for many Years, fully answered the Interest of the Money laid out in Building it: Whether it does so still or not, I will not say, the Trade for Millenary Goods, fine Laces, &amp;c. which was so great above Stairs for many Years, being since scat∣tered and removed, and the Shops, many of them, left empty; but those Shops, of which there were Eight double Rows above, and the Shops and Offices round it below, with the Vaults under the whole, did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t first, yield a very great Sum.</P>
<P>Among other publick Edisices, that of the Hospital of Bethlehem▪ or Bedlam, should not be forgot, which is at the ve∣ry Time of Writing this, appointed to be inlarged with Two new Wings, and will then be the most magnificent Thing of its Kind in the World.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kewne the Custom-house, an acciden∣tal Fire having demolished Part of it, and given the Commissioners Opportunity to take in more Ground, will, when it is finished, out-shine all the Custom houses in Europe.</P>
<P>The Churches in London are rather convenient than fine, not adorned with Pomp and Pageantry as in Popish Coun∣tries; but, like the true Protestant Plain∣ness, they have made very little of Orna∣ment either within them or without, nor, excepting a few, are they famous for hand∣some Steeples, a great many of them are very mean, and some that seem adorned, are rather deform'd than beauisied by the Heads that contrived, or by the Hands that built them.</P>
<P>Some, however, hold up their Heads with Grandeur and Magnificence, and are really Ornaments to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he whole, I mean by these, such as Bow, St. Brides, the new Church in the Strand, Rood Lane Church, or St. Margaret Pattons, St. Antholins, St Clement Danes, and some others, and some of the fifty Churches, now adding by the Bounty and Charity of the Government, are like to be very well adorned.</P>
<P>Three or Four Gothick Towers have been rebuilt at the proper Expences of the Fund appointed, and are not the worst in all the City, namely St Michael at Corn∣hill, St. Dunstan in the East, St. Christo∣phers, St. Mary Aldermary, and at St. Sepulchre's.</P>
<P>But the Beauty of all the Churches in the City, and of all the Portestant Churches in the World, is the Cathedral of St. Paul's; a Building exceeding Beau∣tiful and Magnificent; tho' some Authors are pleased to expose their Ignorance, by pretending to find Fault with it: 'Tis easy to find Fault with the Works even of God himself, when we view them in the Gross, without regard to the particular Beauties of every Part separately considered, and without searching into the Reason and Nature of the Particulars; but when these are maturely inquired into viewed, with a just Reverence, and considered with judg∣ment, then we fly out in due Admirations of the Wisdom of the Author from the Excellency of his Works.</P>
<P>The vast Extent of the Dome, that mighty Arch, on which so great a Weight is supported (meaning the upper Towers or Lanthorn of Stone Work Seventy Feet high) may well account for the strength of the Pillars and Butments below; yet those common Observers of the superfi∣cial Parts of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Building, complain, that the Columns are too gross, that the Work looks heavy, and the lower Figures near the Eye are too large, as if the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tick were not each of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beautiful in their Place as the Corinth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</P>
<P>The wise Architect, like a complea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Master of his Business, had the Satisfacti∣on, in his Life-time, of hearing those ig∣norant Reprovers of his Work confuted, by the Approbation of the best Masters in Europe; and the Church of St. Peter's in Rome, which is owned to be the most finished Piece in the World, only exceeds St Paul's in the Magnificence of its in∣side Work; the Painting, the Altars, the Oratories, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of its Imagery▪

<P>Nay, as it was, those Gentlemen who Parliament opposed Sir Christopher <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en's Request, of having the Dome co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with Copper, and who moved to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had the Lanthorn on the Top made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rter, and built of Wood; I say, those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntlemen pretending Skill in the Art. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offering to reproach the Judgment of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Architect, alledged, That the Copper <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Stone Lanthorn would be to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and that the Pillars below would not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>port it.</P>
<P>To which Sir Christopher answered, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he had sustained the Building with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient Columns, and the Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tment <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every where so good, that he would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer for it with his Head, that it should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Copper Covering and the Stone <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thorn, and seven thousand Ton weight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon it more than was proposed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing below should give way, no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> One half quarter of an Inch; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the contrary, it should be all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and stronger for the weight that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld be laid on it; adding, That it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this View that the Work was brought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its Foundation in such manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade common Observers rather think the first Range of the Buildings too gross for its upper Part; and that, if they pleas∣ed, he would undertake to raise a Spire of Stone upon the whole, a hundred Foot higher than the Cross now stands.</P>
<P>When all these Things are considered complexly, no Man that has the least Judgment in Building, that knows any Thing of the Rules of Proportion, and will judge impartially, can find any Fault in this Church; on the contrary, those excellent Lines of Mr. Dryden, which were too meanly applied in Allegory to the Praise of a paltry Play, may be, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h much more Honour to the Author, and Justice to this Work, be applied here to St. Paul's Church.</P>
<LG>
<L>Strong Dorick Pillars form the Base,</L>
<L>Corinthian fills the upper Space;</L>
<L>So all below is Strength, and▪all above is Grace.</L>
</LG>
<P>Sir Christopher's Design was, indeed, very unhappily baulked in several Things at the beginning, as well in the Situation as in the Conclusion of this Work, which, because very few may have heard of, I shall mention in Publick, from the Mouth of its Author.</P>
<P N="1">I. In the Situation: He would have had the Situation of the Church removed a little to the North, that it should have stood just on the spot of Ground which is taken up by the Street called Pater noster-Row, and the Buildings on either Side; so that the North-side of the Church should have stood open to the Street now called Newgate-street, and the South side, to the Ground on which the Church now stands.</P>
<P>By this Sitnation, the East End of the Church, which is very beautiful, would have looked directly down the main Street of the City, Cheapside; and for the West End, Ludgate having been removed a lit∣tle North, the main Street called Ludgate-stree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Ludgate hill, would only have sloped a little W. S. W. as they do now irregularly two ways, one within, and the other without the Gate, and all the
<PB REF="220"/>
Street beyond Fleet-Bridge would have received no Alterarion at all.</P>
<P>By this situation, the common Tho∣rough-fare of the City would have been removed at a little farther Distance from the Work, and we should nor then have been obliged to walk just under the very W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll as we do now, which makes the Work appear quite out of all Perspective, and is the chief Reason of the Objecti∣ons I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speak of; whereas, had it been viewed at a little Distance, the Building would have been seen infinitely to more Advantage.</P>
<P>Had Sir Christopher been allowed this Situation, he would then, also, have had more Room for the Ornament of the West End, which, tho' it is a most beautiful Work, as it now appears, would have been much more so then, and he would have added a Circular Piazza <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o it, after the Model of that at Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, but much more Magnificent, and an Obelisk of Marble in the Center of the Circle, exceeding any Thing that the World can now shew of its kind, I mean of Modern Work</P>
<P>But the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ircumstance of Things hin∣dered this Noble Design and the City being almost rebuilt before he obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and Provision for saying the Foundation; he was prescribed to the narrow Spot where we see it now stands, in which the Buildidg, however Mag∣finicent in itself, stands with infinite Disadvantage as to the Prospect of it; the Inconveniencies of which was so ap∣parent when the Church was finished, that Leave was at lengh, tho' not with∣out difficulty, obtained, to pull down one whole Row of Houses on the North Side of the Body of the Church, to make Way for the Ballister that surrounds the Cimetry or Church-yard, and▪ indeed, to admit the Light into the Church, as well as to preserve it from the Danger of Fire.</P>
<P>Another Baulk which as I said, Sir Christopher met with, was in the Con∣clusion of the Work, namely, the cover∣ing of the Dome, which Sir Christopher would have had been of Copper double Gilded; but he was over-ruled by Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and the City thereby, deprived of the most glorious Sight that the World eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saw, since the Temple of Solomon.</P>
<P>Yet with all these Disadvantages, the Church is a most regular Building, Beau∣tiful Magnificent, and beyond all the Modern Works of it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k in Europe, St. Peter's at Rome, as above, only excepted.</P>
<P>It is true, St. Peter's, besides its Beauty in Ornament and Im gery, is beyond St Paul's in its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every way larger; but it is the only Church in the World that is so; and it was a merty Hyperbole of Sir Christo∣pher Wren's, who when some Gentle∣men in Discourse compared the Two Churches, and in Compliment to him, pretended to prefer St. Paul's, and when they came to speak of the Dimensions, suggested, that St. Paul's was the big∣gest: <HI>I tell you,</HI> says Sir <HI>Christopher, you might see it in St.</HI> Peter's, <HI>and look for it a good while, before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could find it.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus spoken of the City and adjacent Buildings of London, a d of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ticulars which I find chiefly o∣mitted by other Writers, I have not Room here to enter into all the Arti∣cles needful to a full Description: How∣ever, I shall touch a little at the Thi gs most deserving a stranger's Observa∣tion.</P>
<P>Supposing now, the whole Body of this vast Building to be considered as one City, London, and not concerning myself or the Reader with the Distin ti∣on of its several Jurisdictions; we shall then observe it only as divided into Three▪ viz. the City, the Court, and the Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parts.</P>
<P>The City is the Center of its Com∣merce and Wealth.</P>

That many thousands of Families are so deeply concerned in those Stocks, and find it so absolutely necessary to be at Hand to take the Advantage of buy∣ing and selling, as the sudden Rise or Fall of the Price directs and the Loss they often sustain by their Ignorance of Things when absent, and the Knavery of Brokers and others, whom▪ in their Absence, they are bound to trust, that they find <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obliged to come up and live constantly here, or at least, most Part of the Year.</P>
<P>This i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> why, nowithstand∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Buildings, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new Cities, as they may be called, every Year to the old yet a House is no sooner built, but 'tis te∣nanted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and every Part is crowd▪ with People, and that not only in the Towns, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all the Towns and Villages round, as shall be taken Notice of in its Place.</P>
<P>But let the Citizens and Inhabitants of London know, and it may be worth the Reflection of some of the Landlords, and Builders especially that it Fea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e continues, and the publick Affairs con∣tinue in honest and upright Manage∣ment, there is a Time coming, at least the Nation hopes for it, when the pub∣lick Debts being reduced and paid off, the Funds or Taxes on which they are establish'd, may cease, and so Fifty or Sixty Millions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which are now the solid Bottom of the South Sea Company, East India Company, Bank, &amp;c. will cease, and be no more; by which the Reason of this Conflux of People being removed, they will of Course, and by the Nature of the Thing, return again to their Country Seats▪ to avoid the expensive living at London, as they did come up hither to share the extravagant Gain of their former Business here.</P>
<P>What will be the Condition of this overgrown City in such a Case, I must leave to Time; but all those who know the temporary Constitution of our Funds, know this, 1. That even, if they are to spin out their own Length, all those Funds
<PB REF="222"/>
which were given for Thirty-two Years, have already run out one Third, and some of them almost half the Time, and that the rest will soon be gone: 2. That as in Two Years more, the Government which receives Six per Cent▪ and pays but Five, and will then pay but Four per Cent. In∣terest, will be able every Year to be pay∣ing off and lessening the publick Debt, 'till, in Time, 'tis to be hoped, all our Taxes may cease, and the ordinary Reve∣nue may, as it always used to do, again supply the ordinary Expence of the Go∣vernment.</P>
<P>Then, I say, will be a Time to expect the vast Concourse of People to London, will separate again and disperse as natur∣ally, as they have now crouded hither: What will be the Fate then of all the fine Buildings in the out Parts, in such a Case, let any one judge.</P>
<P>There has formerly been a great Emu∣lation between the Court End of the Town, and the City; and it was once seriously proposed in a certain Reign, how the Court should humble the City; nor was it so impracticable a Thing at that Time, had the wicked Scheme been carried on: Indeed it was carried farther than con∣sisted with the Prudence of a good Go∣vernment, or of a wise People; for the Court envy'd the City's greatness, and the Citizens were ever jealous of the Court's Designs: The most fatal Steps the Court took to humble the City, and which, as I say, did not consist with the Prudence of a good Government, were, 1. The shuting up the Exchequer, and, 2. The bringing a Quo Warranto against their Charter; but these Things can but be touch'd at here; the City has outliv'd it all, and both the Attempts turn'd to the Discredit of the Court Party, who pushed them on: But the City, I say, has gained the Ascendant, and is now made so ne∣cessary to the Court (as before it was thought rather a Grievauce) that now we see the Court itself the daily Instrument to encourage and increase the Opulence of the City, and the City again, by its real Grandeur, made not a Glory only, but an Assistance and Support to the Court, on the greatest and most sudden Emer∣gencies.</P>
<P>Nor can a Breach be now made on any Terms, but the City will have the Ad∣vantage; for while the Stocks, and Bank, and trading Companies remain in the Ci∣ty, the Center of the Money, as well as of the Credit and Trade of the Kingdom, will be there.</P>
<P>Nor are these Capital Offices only ne∣cessarily kept in the City, but several Offices belonging to the publick O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conomy of the Administration, such as the Post-office, the Navy, the Victual∣ling, and the Pay-offices, including the Ordnance-office, which is kept in the Tower. In a Word, the Offices may, in deed, be said to be equally divided.</P>
<P>The City has all those above-men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣oned, and the Court has the Admiralty, the Exchequer, and the Secretaries of State's Offices, with those of the Pay-Masters of the Army, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Besides these, the Council, the Parlia∣ment, and the Courts of Justice, are all kept at the same part of the Town: but as all Suits among the Citizens are, by Virtue of their Privileges, to be try'd within the Liberty of the City, so the Term is obliged to be (as it were) adjour∣ned from Westminster-Hall to Guild Hail, to try Causes there; also Criminal Cases are in like Manner tried Monthly at the Old Baily, where a special Comission is granted for that Purpose to the Judges; but the Lord Mayor always presides, and has the Chair.</P>
<P>The Equality, however, being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> preserved, and a perfect good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> between the Court and City having so long flourished, this Union contribute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greatly to the flourishing Circumstances o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both, and the publick Credit is greatly raised by it; for it was never known<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the City, on any Occasion, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so Assistant to the Government. No <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is so great, but the Bank has been able t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> raise. Here the Exchequer Bills are at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Times circulated, Money advanced upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Funds as soon as laid, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="223"/>
moderate Interest, not incroaching on the Government, or extorting large Interest to eat up the Nation, and disappoint the Sovereign, and defeat his best Designs, as in King William's Time was too much the Practice.</P>
<P>By this great Article of publick Credit, all the King's Business is done with chear∣fulness, Provisions are now bought to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctual the Fleers without Difficulty, and at reasonable Rates. The several Yards where the Ships are built and fitted out, are currently paid: The Magazines of Millitary and Naval Stores kept full: In a Word, by this very Article of publick Credit, of which the Parliament is the Foundation (and the City, are the Archi∣tectures or Builders) all those great Things are now done with Ease, which, in the former Reigns, went on heavily, and were brought about with the utmost Dif∣ficulty.</P>
<P>But, to return to the City; Besides the Companies and publick Offices, which are kept in City, there are several parti∣cular Offices and Places, some built or repaired on Purpose, and others hired and beautified for the particular Business they carry on respectively: As,</P>
<P>Here are several great Offices for sever∣al Societies of Ensurers; for here almost all Hazards may be ensured; the Four principal are called, 1. Royal Exchange Ensurance: 2. The London Ensurers: 3. The Hand in Hand Fire office: 4. The Sun Fire office.</P>
<P>In the Two first of those, all Hazards by Sea are ensured, that is to say, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Goods, not Lives; as also Houses and Goods are ensured from Fire.</P>
<P>In the last, only Houses and Good<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>In all which Offices, the Premio is so small, and the Recovery, in case of Loss, to easy and certain, where no Fraud is suspected, that nothing can be shewn like it in the whole World; especially that of ensuring Houses from Fire, which has now attained such an universal▪ Approba∣tion, that I am told, there are above Seventy thousand Houses thus ensured in London, and the Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>The East India House is in Leadenhall-Street, an old, but spacious Building; very convenient, though not beautiful, and I am told, it is under Consulation to have it taken down, and rebuilt with ad∣ditional Buildings for Warehouses and Cel∣lars for their Goods, which at present are much want ed all which is of late per∣form'd.</P>
<P>The African Company's House is in the same Street, a very handsome, well∣built, and convenient House, and which fully serves for all the Offices their Busi∣ness requires.</P>
<P>The Bank is kept in Grocer's Hall▪ a very convenient Place, and, considering its Situation, so near the Exchange, a very spacious, commodious Place.</P>
<P>Here Business is dispatch'd with such Exactness, and such Expedition and so much of it too, that it is really prodigi∣ous; no Confusion, no body is either de∣nied or delayed Payment, the Merchants who keep their Cash there, are sure to have their Bills always paid, and even Ad∣vances made on easy Terms, if they have Occasion. No Accounts in the World are more exactly kept, no Place in the World has so mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Business done, with so much Ease.</P>
<P>In the next Street (the Old Jury) is the Excise Office, in a very large House, formerly the Dwelling of Sir John Fre∣drick, and afterwards, of Sir Joseph Hern, very considerable Merchants. In this one Office is managed an immense Weight of Business, and they have in Pay, as I am told, near Four thousand Officers: The whole Kingdom is divided by them into proper Districts, and to every District, a Collector, a Supervisor, and a certain Number of Gaugers, called, by the vul∣gar Title Excise Men▪</P>
<P>Nothing can be more regular, than the Methods of this Office, by which an Account of the whole Excise is transmit∣ted from the remotest Parts of the King∣dom, once every Six Weeks, which is called a S tring, and the Money received, or Prosecutions commenced for it, in the next Sitting.</P>
<P><PB REF="224"/>
Under the management of this Office, are now brought, not only the Excise upon Beer, Ale, and other Liquors, as formerly, but also the Duties on Malt and Candles, Hops, Soap, and Leather, all which are managed in several and distinct Classes, and the Accounts kept in distinct Books; but, in many Places, are collected by the same Officers, which makes the Charge of the Collection much easier to the Government: Nor is the like Duty collected in any Part of the World, with so little Charge, or so few Officers.</P>
<P>The South Sea House is situate in a large spot of Ground, between Broad∣street, and Threadneedle street, two large Houses having been taken in, to form the whole Office, but, as they were, notwithstanding, straighten'd for Room, and were obliged to summon their Ge∣neral Courts in another Place, viz. At Merchant-Taylors Hall; so they have now resolved to erect a new and com∣pleat Building for the whole Business, which is to be exceeding fine and large, and to this End, the Company has pur∣chased several adjacent Buildings, so that the Ground is inlarged towards Thread∣needle-street; but, it seems, they could not be accommodated to their Minds on the side next Broad-street, so we are told, they will not open a Way that Way, as before.</P>
<P>As the Company are enlarging their Trade to America, and have also engag∣ed in a new Trade, namely, That of the Greenland Whale Fishing, they are like to have an Occasion to enlarge their Offices. This Building, they as∣sure us, will cost the Company, from ten to twenty thousand Pounds, that is to say, a very great sum.</P>
<P>The Post Office, a Branch of the Re∣venue formerly not much valued, but now, by the additional Penny upon the Letters, and by the visible increase of Business in the Nation, is grown very considerable. This Office maintains now, Pacquet Boats to Spain and Portugal, which never was done before: So the Merchants Letters for Cadiz or Lisbon, which were before two and twenty Days in going over France and Spain to Lisbon, oftentimes arrive there now, in nine or ten Days from Falmouth.</P>
<P>Likewise, they have a Pacquet from Marscilles to Port Mahone, in the Me∣diterranean, for the constant communi∣cation of letters with his Majesty's Gar∣rison and People in the Island of Mi∣norca.</P>
<P>They have also a Pacquet from Eng∣land to the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Indies; but I am <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Opinion, that they will k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ep it up for much Time longer, if it be not already let fall.</P>
<P>This Office is kept in Lombard street, in a large House, formerly Sir Robert Viner's, once a rich Goldsmith; but ru∣ined at the shutting up of the Exche∣quer, as above.</P>
<P>The Penny Post, a modern Contri∣vance of a private Person, one Mr. William Dockraw, is new made a Branch of the general Revenue by the Post-Of∣fice; and though, for a Time, it was subject to Miscarriages and Mistakes, yet now it is come also into so exquisite a Management, that nothing can be more exact, and 'tis more exact, and 'tis with the utmost safety and dispatch, that Let∣ters are delivered at the remorest Cor∣ners of the Town, almost as soon as they could be sent by a Messenger, and that from Four, Five, Six, to Eight Times a-Day, according as the Distance of the Place makes i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> practicable; and you may send a Letter from Ratcliff or Limehouse in the East, to the farthest Part of Westminster for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and that several times in the same day.</P>
<P>Nor are you tied up to a single Peice of Paper, as in the General Post Office, but any Packet under a Pound weight, goes at the same Price.</P>
<P>I mention this the more particularly, because it is so manifest a testimony to the Greatness of this City, and to the great Extent of Business and Commerce in it, that this Penny conveyance should
<PB REF="225"/>
raise so many thousand Pounds in a Year, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mploy so many poor Peo∣ple in the Diligence of it, as this Office employs.</P>
<P>We see nothing of this at Paris, at Am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etdam, at Hamburgh, or any other City, that ever I have seen, or heard of.</P>
<P>The Custom-House I have just men∣tioned before, but must take up a few Lines to mention it again. The state∣liness of this Building shewed the Great∣ness of the Business that is transacted there: The Long Room is like an Ex∣change every Morning, and the Crowd of People who appear there, and he Busi∣ness they do, is not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by Words, nothing of that Kind in Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s like it.</P>
<P>Yet it has been found, that the Busi∣ness of Export and Import in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Port of London, is so prodigiously increased, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the several new Offices, when they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re bound to erect for the managing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dditional Parts of the Customs, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the old Building, though very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is too little, and as the late Fire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnt or demolish'd some Part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est End of the Custom House, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave had the Opportunity in rebuilding, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enlarge it very much, by buying in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ground of some of the demolished <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouses, to add to the Custom House, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich is become now a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> glorious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulding</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eys, or Wharfs, next the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fronting not the Custom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the whose space from the sower <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Dock, to the Bridge, ought to taken Notice of as a publi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Building; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are they less an Ornament to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, as they are a Testimony of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> carried on in it, than the Royal change it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf.</P>
<P>The Revenue, or Income, brought in these Wharfs, inclusive of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> belonging to them, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they employ, is said to amount to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sum; and, as I am told, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so little as Forty thousand Pounds Annum: And abundance of Porters, Watchmen, Wharfingers, and other Of∣ficers, are maintained here by the Busi∣ness of the Wharfs; in which, one Thing is very remarkable, That here are Por∣ters▪ and poor working Men, who, though themselves not worth, perhaps, twenty Pounds in the World are trusted with great Quantities ofvalu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble Goods, some∣times to the Value of several Thousand Pounds, and yet 'tis very rarely to be heard, that any Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s or Embezzlement is made. The Number of these Keys extending, as above, from the Bridge to the Tower Dock is seventeen.</P>
<P>From these publick Places, I come next to the Markets, which, in such a Mass of Building, and such a Collection of People▪ and where such Business is done, must be great, and very many. To take a View of them in particular:</P>
<P>First, Smithfield Market for living Cat∣tle, which is, without Question, the greatest in the World; no Description can be given of it, no Calculation of the Numbers of Creatures sold there, can be made. This Market is every Monday and Friday.</P>
<P>There is, indeed, a Liberty taken by the Butchers, to go up to Islington, and to Whitechapel, and boy of the Country Drovers, who bring Cattle to Town; but this is called F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>talling the Market, and is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by Law.</P>
<P>There is also a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or ra∣ther Fair for Horses, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every Friday in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Numbers of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and those of the highest Price are to be sold Weekly</P>

<P>These Markets are so considerable in themselves, that they will me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it a longer and more particular Description, than I have Room for in this Place. I shall, however, briefly mention them again in their Order.</P>
<P>Of the Fourteen Flesh Markets, or Markets for Provisions, Seven of them are of antient standing, Time out of Mind: But the other Seven are erected since the Enlargement of Buildings mentioned a∣bove. The old ones are, Leaden-Hall, Honey-Lane, Newgate Market, South∣wark, Clare, St. James's, and Westminster; and these are so considerable, such Num∣bers of Buyers, and such an infinite Quan∣tity of Provisions of all Sorts, Flesh, Fish, and Fowl, that, especially of the First, no City in the World can equal them. 'Tis of the first of these Markets, that a certain Spinsh Ambassador said, There was as much Meat sold in it in one Month as would suffice all Spain for a Year.</P>
<P>This great Market, called, Leaden hall though standing in the Middle of the City contains Three large Squares, every Squa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having several Outlets into divers Street and all into one another. The First, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Chief, is called, The Beef Market, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has Two large Gates, one into Lea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Hall Street, one into Gracehurch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Two smaller, viz. One by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pav'd Passage leading into Limestreet, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one under a Gateway from the Seco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Square. In this Square, every Wedn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day is kept a Market for raw Hides, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Leather, and Shoemakers Tools; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Warehouses, up Stairs on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and South Sides of the Square, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Market for Colechester Bayes.</P>
<P>The second Square is divided into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Oblongs, in the first is the Fish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and in the other, a Market for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Higlers, who bring small Things, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pork, Butter, Eggs, Pigs, Country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with some Fowls, and such like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fare.</P>
<P>The North Part of the Fish Market▪ Place being too large for the Fishmo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Use, are the Stalls of the Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Mutton and Veal the best and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of which, that England can produce, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be bought there, and the East Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Flesh Market for Country Butchers.</P>
<P><PB REF="227"/>
The third, and last Square, which is also very large, is divided into three Parts: Round the Circumference, is the Butter-Market, with all the sorts of the Higglary Goods, as before: The South Part is the Poulty-Market, and the Ba∣con-Market, and the Center is an Herb-Market.</P>
<P>All the other Markets follow the same Method in Proportion to the Room they have for it; and there is an Herb Market in every one; but the chief Markets in the whole City for Herbs and Garden∣stuff, are the Stocks and Covent Garden.</P>
<P>There are but two Corn Markets in the whole City and Out Parts; but they are Monsters for Magnitude, and not to be matched in the World These are Bear Key, and Queen Hith: To the first comes all the vast Quantity of Corn that is brought into the City by Sea, and here Corn may be said, not to be sold by Cart Loads, or Horse Loads, but by Ship Loads, and, except the Corn Chambers and Magazines in Holland, when the Fleets come in from Dantzick and England, the whole World cannot equal the Quantity bought and sold here.</P>
<P>This is the Place whither all the Corn is brought, which, as I have observed, is provided in all the Counties of England, near the Sea Coast, and shipp'd for Lon∣don, and no Quantity can be wanted, ei∣ther for home Consumption, or for Foreign Exportation, but the Corn Factors, who are the Managers of this Market, are rea∣dy to supply it.</P>
<P>The other, which I call a Corn Mar∣ket too, is at Queen Hith; but this Mar∣ket is chiefly, if not wholly, so. Malt; as to the whole Corn, as the Quantity of Malt brought to this Market is prodigious great, so I must observe too, that this Place is the Receiver of all the Malt, the Barley of which, takes up the Ground of so many hundred thousand Acres of Land in the Counties of Surrey, Bucks, Berks, Oxford, Southampton, and Wilts, and is called West Country Malt.</P>
<P>It is true, there is a very great Quan∣tity of Malt, and of other Corn too, brought to some other Places on the Ri∣ver, and sold there, viz. To Milford Lane, above the Bridge, and the Hermi∣tage, below the Bridge; but this is but, in general, a Branch of the Trade of the other Places.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted, that Queen Hith is also a very great Market for Meal, as well as Malt, and, perhaps, the greatest in England.</P>
<P>The Vessels which bring this Malt and Meal to Queen Hith, are worth the Ob∣servation of any Stranger that understands such Things They are remarkable for the Length of the Vessel▪ and the Burthen they carry, and yet the little Water they draw; in a Word, some of those Barges carry above a thousand Quarter of Malt at Time, and yet do not draw two Foot of Watter. N. B. A Thousand Quarter of Malt must be granted to be, at least, a hundred Tun Burthen. Note also, Some of these large Barges come as far as from Abbington, which is above one hundred and Fifty miles from London, if we mea∣sure by the River.</P>
<P>The next Market, which is more than ordinary remarkable, is the Coal Market at Billingsgate. This is kept every Morn∣ing on the broad Place just at the Head of Billingsgate Dock, and the Place is cal∣led Room Land; from what old forgot∣ten Original it has that Name, History is silent. I need not, except for the sake of Strangers, take Notice, that the City of London, and Parts adjacent, as also all the South of England, is supplied with Coals, called therefore Sea-coal, from New∣castle upon Tine, and from the Coast of Durham, and Northumberland. This Trade is so considerable, that it is esteemed the great Nursery of our best Seamen, and of which I shall have occasion to say more in my Account of the Northern Parts of England. The Quantity of Coals, which it is supposed are, Communibus Annis, burnt and consumed in and about this Ci∣ty, is supposed to be about Five hundred thousand Chalder, every Chalder contain∣ing thirty six Bushels, and generally weigh∣ing about thirty hundred Weight.</P>
<P><PB REF="228"/>
All these Coals are bought and sold on this little of Room Land, and though sometimes, especially in case of War, or of contrary Winds, a Fleet of five hun∣dred to seven hundred sail of ships, comes up the River at a Time, yet they ne∣ver want a market: The Brokers, or Buy∣ers of these Coals, are called Crimps, for what Reason, or Original, is likewise a mystery peculiar to this Trade; for these People are noted for giving such d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k Names to the several Pares of their Trade; so the Vessels they load their ships with at Newcastle, are called Keels, and the Ships that bring them, are called Cats, and Hags, or Hag Boats, and the like. But of that hereafter.</P>
<P>The increase of this Consumption of Coals is another Evidence of the great increase of the City of London; for, within a few Years past, the import of Coals was not, in the River of Thames, so great by very near half.</P>
<P>It must be observed, that as the City of London occasions the Consumption of so great a Quantity of Corn and Coals, so the Measurement of them is under the Inspection of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen, and for the Ditection of which, there are allowed a certain Number of Corn▪Meeters, and bring them in a very considerable in∣come. These Places are in the Gift of the Lord Mayor for the Time being, and are generally sold for three o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our thousand Pounds a Peice, when they fall.</P>
<P>They have abundance of poor men em∣ploy'd under them, who are called, also, Meeters, and are, or ought to be, Free∣men of the City.</P>
<P>This is, indeed, a Rent-charge upon the Buyer, and is a kind of Gabel, as well upon the Coals as the Corn; but the Buyer is abundantly recompensed, by being ascertain'd in his measure with∣out any Fraud; so that having bought his Coals or Corn, he is perfectly un∣concerned about the measure, for the sworn Meeters are so placed between the buyer and seller, that no injury can be offered, nor have I heard that any com∣plaint of injustice is ever made against the Meeters, who are generally men of good character, are sworn to do Right, and cannot easily do Wrong without be∣ing detected; so many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> about them, and so many several Persons con∣cerned in the Work, who have no Depen∣dance one upon another.</P>
<P>There is one great Work yet behind▪ which, however, seems necessary to a full Description of the City of London, and that is the Shipping and the Pool; but in what manner can any Writer go about it, to bring it into any reasonable compass? The Thing is a kind of Infi∣nite, and the Parts to be separated from one another in such a Description, are so many, that it is hard to know where to begin.</P>
<P>The whole River, in a Word, from London-Bridge▪ to Black Wall, is one great Arsenal, nothing in the World can be like it. The great Building-Yards at Schedam near Amsterdam, are said to out▪do them in the Number of Ships which are built there, and they tell us, that there me more Ships generally seen at Amsterdam▪ than in the Thames.</P>
<P>As to the Bu lding Part▪ I will not say, but that there may be more Vessels built at Schedam, and the Parts adjacent, than in the River Thames; but then it must be said:</P>
<P N="1">1 That the English build for them∣selves only, the Dutch for all the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. That almost all the Ships the Dutch have▪ are built there, whereas, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Part of our shipping <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Thames; but abundance of Ship are built at all the Sea Ports in Eng∣land▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch as at Newcastle, Sunder∣land, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Whitby, Hull, Gainsbo∣rough▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lynn, Yarmouth, Al∣borough, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ipswich and Har∣wich, upon the East Coast; and at Sho∣ram▪ Arund<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ Brighthelmston, Portsmouth, Southampton▪ Pool, Weymouth, Dart∣mouth, Plymouth, besides other Places, on the South coast.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="229"/>
3. That we see more Vessels in less Room at Amsterdam; but the setting aside their Hoys, Bilanders and Schoots, which are in great Numbers always there, being Vessels particular to their Inland and Coasting Navigation; you do not see more Ships, nor near so many Ships of Force, at Amsterdam as at London.</P>
<P N="4">4. That you see more Ships there in in less Room, but, perhaps, not so many Ships in the whole.</P>
<P>That Part of the River of Thames which is properly the Harbour, and where the Ships usually deliver or unload their Cargoes, is called the Pool, and begins at the turning of the River out of Limehouse-Reach, and extends to the Custom▪house Keys: In this Compass I have had the Curiosity to count the Ships as well as I could, <HI>en passant,</HI> and have found above two thousand sail of all sorts, not reckoning Barges, Lighters or Pleasure Boats, and Yatchs; but of Vessels that really go to Sea.</P>
<P>It is true, the River or Pool, seem'd, at that time, to be pretty full of ships; it is true also, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ships which lay in Deptford and Black Wall Reaches, and in the Wet Docks, where∣of, there are no less than three; but '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is as true▪ that we did not include the Men of War at the King's Yard, and in the Wet Dock there at Deptford, which were not a very few.</P>
<P>In the River, as I have observed, there are from Battle Bridge on the South∣wark side, and the Hermitag-Bridge on the City side, reckoning to Black-Wall, inclusive,

</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>This is inclusive of the Builders of Lighters, &amp;c. but exclusive of Boat Build∣ers, Wherry-Builders, and above Bridge Barge-Builders.</P>
<P>To enter into any Description of the great Magazines of all manner of Naval Stores, for the furnishing those Buildings, would be endless, and I shall not attempt it; 'tis sufficient to add▪ That England, as I have said elsewhere, is an inex∣haustible Store-house of Timber, and all the Oak Timber, and generally the Plank also, used in the building these ships, is found in England only, nay, and which is more, it is not fetched from the remoter Parts of England, but these Southern Counties near us are the Places where 'tis generally found; as particularly the Counties of Berks and B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks, Surrey, Kent, Sussex, Essex and Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olk, and very little is brought far∣ther▪ nor can al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ship building the whole Kingdom are able to build▪ ever exhaust those Counties, tho' they were to build much mor than they do.</P>
<P>But I must land, lest this Part of the Account seems to smell of the Tar, and I should tire the Gentlemen with leading them out of their Knowledge.</P>
<P>I should men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for the information of strangers, &amp;c. that the Buildings of this great City are chiefly of Brick, as many ways found to be the safest, the cheapest, and the most commodious of all other Materials; by safe; I mean from Fire, and as by Act of Parliament, every Builder is bound to have a Parthian W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of Back also, one Brick and Hall thick between every House, it is found to be, indeed, very helpful in case of Fire.</P>
<P>And as I am speaking of Fire and burning of Houses, it cannot be omitted▪ That no where in the World is so good Care taken to quench Fires as in Lon∣don; I will not say the like Care is taken to prevent them; for I may say That I think the Servants, nay, and Masters too in London, are the most careless People in the World about Fire and this, no doubt, is the Reason why there are frequently more Fires in Lon∣don and in the Out parts, than there ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all the Cities of Europe put them to∣gether; nor are they the more careful as I can learn, either from Observation
<PB REF="230"/>
or Report, I say, they are not made more cautious, by the innumerable Fires which continually happen among them.</P>
<P>And this leads me back to what I just now said, That no City in the World is so well furnished for the extinguishing Fires when they happen.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the great Convenience of Wa∣ter which being every where laid in the Streets in large Timber Pipes, as well from the Thames as the New-River, those Pipes are furnished with a Fire Plug, which the Parish Officers have the Key of and when opened, let out not a Pipe, but a River of Water into the Streets, so that making but a Dam in the Kennel, the whole Street is immediately under Water to supply the Engines.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the graat Number of admirable Engines, of which, almost, every Parish has One, and some Halls also, and some private Citizens have them of their own, so that no sooner does a Fire break out, but the House is surrounded with Engines, and a Flood of Water poured upon it, 'till the Fire is, as it were, not extinguished only, but drowned.</P>
<P N="3">3. The several Ensurance Offices, of which I have spoken above, have each of them a certain Sett of Men, who they keep in constant Pay, and who they fur∣nish with Tools proper for the Work, and and to whom they give Jack-Caps of Lea∣ther, able to keep them from Hurt, if Brick or Timber, or any thing not of too great a Bulk, should fall upon them; these Men make it their Business to be ready at Call, all Hours, and Night or Day, to assist in case of Fire; and it must be acknowledg∣ed▪ they are very dextrous, bold, diligent and successful. These they call Fire-men, but with an odd kind of Contradiction in the Title, for they are really most of them Water-men.</P>
<P>Having mentioned, that the City is so well furnished with Water, it cannot be omitted, that there are Two great Engines for the raising for Water, one at the Bridge, and the other near Brok∣en Wharf; these raise so great a Quan∣tity of Water, that, as they tell us, they are able to supply the whole City <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> its utmost Extent, and to supply eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> House also, with a running Pipe of W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter up to the uppermost Story.</P>
<P>However, the New-River, which i brought by an Aqueduct or artificial S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Ware, continnes to supply the great∣er Part of the City with Water, only with this Addition by the way, that they have been obliged to dig a new Head <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Basin at Iflington on a higher Ground the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that which the natural Stream of the Ri∣ver supplies, and this higher Basin the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fill from the lower, by a great Engi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worked formerly with Six Sails, now b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many Horses constantly working; so fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that new Elevation of the Water, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> supply the higher Part of the Town wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same Advantage, and more Ease th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Thames Engines do it.</P>
<P>There was a very likely Proposal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on Foot by some Gentlemen, whose G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nius seem'd equal to the Work, for dra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing another River, rather larger than th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now running, and bringing it to a He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on some rising Grounds beyond Mary Bonne.</P>
<P>This Water was proposed to be broug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the little Coln or Cole near St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣bans, and the River, called Two Wate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> near Rickmansworth, and as I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Course of the Water, and the sever Supplies it was to have, and how the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter-level was drawn for containing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Current, I must acknowledge it was very Practical Undertaking, and men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Encouragement; but it was oppole<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parliament, and dropt for the prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> This Design was particularly calculat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for supplying those prodigious Additi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Buildings, which I have already scrib'd at the West End of the Town.</P>
<P>However, tho' this be laid aside, also several Water-houses in other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> particularly one at Wapping, one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Battle-Bridge in Southwark, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one at York-Buildings, yet it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not be denied, that the City of Lon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is the best supplied with Water of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great City in the World, and upon as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Terms to its Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB REF="231"/>
There were formerly several beautiful Conduits of Running-Watter in London, which Water was very sweet and good, and was brought at an infinite Expence. from several distant Springs, in large lead∣en Pipes to those Conduits, and this was so lately, that several of those Conduits were re built since the Fire, as one on Snow-Hill and one at Stocks-Market, which serves as a Pedestal for the great Equestrian Statue of King Charles the II. erected there at the Charge of Sir Robert Viner, then Lord Mayor, and who was then an eminent Banker in Lombard street; but his Loyalty could not preserve him from being ruined by the common Calami∣ty, when the King shut up the Exchequer.</P>
<P>They tell us a merry Story of this Sta∣tue, how true it may be, let those testify who saw it, if any such Witnesses remain, viz That a certain famous Court Lady, I do not say it was the D—ss of Ports∣mouth, being brought to Bed of a Son late in the Night, the next Morning this glorious Equestrian Statue had a Pillion handsomely placed on it behind the Body of the K—, with a Paper pinned to the Trapping of the Pillion, with Words at length, Gone for a Midwife</P>
<P>It is scarce worth while to give an Ac∣count of the Statues in this City, they are neither many, or are those which are, very valuable.</P>
<P>The Statue of King Charles II. in Mar∣ble, standing in the middle of the Royal Exchange, is the best beyond Comparison; one of the same Prince, and his Father, standing in Two large Niches on the South Front of the same Building, and being big∣ger than the Life, are coarse Pieces com∣pared to it.</P>
<P>The Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues of the Kings and Queens, Seventeen of which are already put up in the Inside of the Royal Exchange, are to∣lerable, but all infinitely inferior to that in the middle.</P>
<P>There is a Statue of Sir Thomas Gre∣sham, the Founder of the Royal Exchange, which outdoes many of those Kings, only that it stands in a dark Corner, and is lit∣tle noticed; 'tis placed in a Nitch under the Piazza, in the North West Angle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Exchenge, just regarding the Turk Walk, and he has a Bale of Silk lying b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him.</P>
<P>There is another Equestrian Statue, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but One, as I remember, within the City and that is of King James the First on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> North Front of one of the Gates of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> City called Aldersgate: This was erected on the Occasion of that King's entring the City at that Gate when he arrived here from Scotland, to take the Crown after the Death of Queen Elizabeth; when that Statue was finely painted and Gilded, which is not usual, nor is the Gilding yet worn off; there are some emblematick Figures remaining, which were then suited to the Occasion of his triumphal Entry, and there was another Arch form'd for the Day at the Bars, where the Liberties of the City end▪ t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at way which is now called Goswell-street, but that was taken down soon after.</P>
<P>The Gates of the City are Seven, be∣sides Posterns, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns that re∣main are Four, besides others that are demolished.</P>
<P>The Gates are all remaining. Two of them which were demolished at the Fire, being beautifully Re-built: These are Lud∣gate and Newgate; the First a Prison for Debt for Freemen of the City only, the other a Prison for Criminals, both for London and Middlesex, and for Debtors also for Middlesex, being the County Goal.</P>
<P>Moregate is also Re-built, and is a very beautiful Gateway, the Arch being near Twenty Foot high, which was done to give Room for the City Train'd Bands to go through to the Artillery Ground, where they Muster, and that they might march with their Pikes advanc'd, for then they had Pikemen in every Regiment, as well in the Army as in the Militia, which since that, is quite left off; this makes the Gate look a little out of Shape, the Oc∣casion of it not being known. Cripple∣gate and Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gate are very Old, and make but a mean Figure: Aldersgate is a∣bout One hundred and Twenty Years old,
<PB REF="232"/>
and yet being Beautified, as I said, on the Occasion of King James's Entry, looks very handsome.</P>
<P>Aldgate was very ancient and decay'd, so that <HI>as Old as Aldgate,</HI> was a City-Proverb for many Years; but this Gate was Re-built also, upon the Triumphant Entry of K. James I. and look<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> still very well; on the East side of this Gate are two statues in stone, representing two Men, from the waste upward, and in Armour, throwing down two great stones, suppo∣sing it to be on an Enemy assaulting the G <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I mention, because some ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ago, one of these Men in Armour, whether tired with holding it so long, or dreaming of Enemies assaulting the Gate, our Authors do not inform us; but he threw down the stone, or rathet let it fall, after having held it upwards of an hun∣dred Years; but, as it happened, it did no harm.</P>
<P>Most of these Gates are given by the City to the chief of the Officers of the City to live in, and the Houses are very convenient Dwellings.</P>
<P>Temple Bar is the only Gate which is erected at the Extent of the City Li∣berties, and this was occasioned by some needful Ceremonies at the Proclaming any King or Queen of England, at which Time the Gates are shut; the Herald at Arms knocks hard at the Door, the Sheriffs of the City call bac, k asking who is there? Then the Herald answers, <HI>I come to Proclaim,</HI> &amp;c. according to the Name of the Prince who is to suc∣ceed to the Crown, repeating the Titles of Great Britain, France and Ireland, &amp;c. at which the Sheriffs open, and bid them Welcome, and so they go on to the Ex∣change, where they make the last Procla∣mation.</P>
<P>This Gate is adorned with the Figures of Kings below, and Traytors above, the Heads of several Criminals executed for Treason being set up there; the Sta∣tues below are of Queen Elizabeth and King James I. King Charles I. and II. and this is the fourth statue of K. Charles II. which is to be seen in the City of Lon∣don, besides his Picture nobly done at full Length, which was set up formerly in the Guild-Hall.</P>
<P>There are in London, and the far ex∣tended Bounds, which I now call so, not∣withstanding we are a Nation of Liberty, more publick and private Prisons, and Houses of Confinement, than any Cry in Europe, perhaps as many as in all the Capital Cities of Europe put together for Example:</P>

<P><PB REF="234"/>
The Ruins of that Old Palace, seem, to predict, that the Time will come, when that Phoenix shall revive, and when a Building shall be erected there, suiting the Majesty and Magnificence of the Brit∣ish Princes, and the Riches of the British Nation.</P>
<P>Many Projects have been set on foot for the re-building the Antient Palace of White-hall; but most of them have re∣lated rather to a Fund for raising the Mo∣ney, than a Model for the Building; But as I once saw a Model for the Palace it∣self, know its Author, and when it was pro∣posed, and that I still believe that Scheme willrat last, be the Ground-plot of the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> itself, I believe it will not be disagrecab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to give a brief Account of the Design.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>A Scheme for a <HI>Royal Palace</HI> in the Place of <HI>White-Hall.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FIRST, it was Proposed, that the whole Building should be of Port∣land Stone, and all the Front be exactly after the Model of the Banquetting House, with such Alterati∣ons only, as the Length and Height of the Building made necessary.</P>
<P>That the First Floor of the Building should be raised from the present Surface, at least Eight Feet, as the present Build∣ing of the Banquetting House now is.</P>
<P>That the whole Building should make four Fronts one to the Water-side and one to the Canal in the Park, a Third to the North facing Charing Cross, and the fourth to the South facing King street in West∣minster.</P>
<P>That every Front should contain 400 Yards, or 1200 Feet, in length; that there shou'd be four Areas or Squares in the Inside of the Building, the First from the North Entrance to be Oblong, taking up the whole Length of the Building from East to West, and that then a long Build∣ing should cross the whole Work, Eighty Feet broad, and from the East Range One thousand Feet broad to the West; and in the middle of which, should be a great Arch or Gate looking to the South Gate of the Palace: That the other Side of the Palace be divided into Three Squares, having Two Ranges of Build∣ings to run cross them from South to North, and each Range to joyn the great Range of Building which runs from East to West.</P>
<P>That the whole Building be withdrawn from the River so far, at least, as where the Statue of King James II. now stands, and a spacious Terras to be carried on in∣to the Thames Twelve Feet beyond Low Water-Mark, and over the River a hand∣some Foot bridge of Twelve great Arches only, with a Causeway at the End over St. George's Fields; that the Te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ras <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Space between the Palace and the Wate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ be made into a fine Garden, with an Oran∣gery on the North▪side, reaching to the Edge of the Terras so effectually, as it may cover the Garden from the View of any of the Buildings on the Strand∣side, and a Royal Bagn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o at the other End likewise, to cover the necessary Building<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the Kitchins which are behind it.</P>
<P>For the Extent North, 'tis proposed▪ That all the Buildings be taken down to the Wall of Northumberland House, on that Side; and to the North side of the Spring Garden, opposite to Suffolk-st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Hay Market on the other Side
<PB REF="235"/>
so the Front of the Building that Way, will extend from the hither part of Scot∣land yard gate, to Prince Rupert's Garden, and the Gate of the Palace being in the Center of the Building, will open in that which is now called the Sping Garden.</P>
<P>One Gate of the Palace opening thus North, a Ballustrade of Iron, like that which surrounds St. Paul's Church, should take in a large Parade, reaching to the Meuse-Gate, a Space for the Street only excepted, and in proportion tho other way towards Pall-Mall; and here on the East side, and on the West-side, Two large Guard-houses should be erected, fitted, the one for the Horse Guards, and the other for the Foot, both within the Ballustrade, but without the Palace, and Two smaller Guard-houses for Detachments of both, be likewise placed on the South-side, all at a proper Distance from the main Build∣ing, and all low built.</P>
<P>The Canal in the Park would be neces∣sarily filled up for about a hundred Yards, for the Extent of the Building that Way; the Street that now is, must, at the same Time, be turned, and a large Street for Communication with Westminster, be al∣lowed to cross the Park from the Pall-Mall South, towards Westminster, to come out at the New Iron Gate, now leading to Queen's square and Tottil-street; but no Houses to be built in it, and Four Gates in the said Street, to lead over the Street, from the First Floor of the Palace, by Galleries into the Park; All Buildings ad∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining to the Park to be taken down, nor any private Doors or Keys to be al∣lowed; a Stone Wall of twenty Feet high and eight Feet thick, to be built round the Park, and the Park to be extended West, by taking in Buckingham House, with its Gardens.</P>
<P>In this Building, the Proposer's Scheme was To have all the Offices of the King's Exchequer, the Revenue, the Council, the Secretaries of State, the Admiralty, the Courts of Justice, and both Houses of Parliament, contain'd within the Palace, as was the Usage in former Times.</P>
<P>To this purpose, the cross Range o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Buildings, going from East to West, througl the Center of the Palace, and looking in to the great oblong Court, which would contain a thousand Feet, exclusive of the East and West Fronts, and of the great Arch or Gate in the Center, should be di∣vided thus; That Part on the East-side of the Gate to contain Two spacious Rooms, one for the House of Peers, the other for the House of Commons, with sufficient Offices, Galleries of Communication, Rooms of Conference for Committees, a Court of Requests, &amp;c. for the Use of the Mem∣bers, and Rooms for all other Occasion, of Parliament Business.</P>
<P>The West Part of this great Range of Building to contain a Hall, as Westmin∣ster-Hall now is, with proper separated Courts for the King's Bench, Chancery, Common Pleas, and Exchequer-Bars, and a distinct Court fix'd, and suitably pre∣pared, for the Tryals of Peers or others, by the House of Lords, notwithstanding which, this Court would be sufficiently large to celebrate the Coronation Feast, with all its Ceremonies, the Building be∣ing from the middle Arch to the West Range of the Buildings, five hundred Feet long at least, and one hundred Feet broad.</P>
<P>Thus the King's Court of Justice, his High Court of Parliament, and all the Affairs of the Administration, would be managed within his own House, as it anci∣ently was; and as the two cross Ranges of Buildings, which form'd the three Courts on the South-side of the Parliament House and Hall of Justice, would be very large, they would afford Room for the Lord Chamberlain's Office, the Admiralty, the War Office, the Green-Cloth, the Ward∣robe Office, and all the other Family Of∣fices, too many to name here.</P>
<P>Then the main Range of Building on the North-side of the Palace, should con∣tain (because nearest the City) the Trea∣sury Office, the Secretary's Offices, the Council Chambers, and the Exchequer Offices.</P>
<P><PB REF="236"/>
The Apartments of the other three Ranges to be wholly taken up with the King's Houshold; for Example:</P>
<P N="1">1.

The family for the Royal Children, to take up the West end of the said South Range of Build∣ings, with the like Garden also, and a Gate joining the two Walls in the mid∣dle of the Passage, leading to the South Gate of the Palace, by which, with an easy Ascent of steps, a communica∣tion should be made between the said two Gardens.</P>
<P>The West Range of Buildings front∣ing the Park should be divided also into two Parts, the first being the North End, to consist of Royal Apartments for the entertainment of foreign Princes and foreign Ambassadors, at the Pleasure of the King, and the other half, or South end to be called the Prince's Lodgings, and to be for the Prince of Wales for the time being, and his family.</P>
<P>The great Arch in the center of the whole, and in the middle of the long Range of Buildings, to support a large Church or Chapel Royal, for the service of all the houshold, and for preaching before the Houses of Parliament on publick Days, as is now at St. Marga∣ret's and at the Abbey: Over this Church a large Dome or Cupola of stone, co∣vered with Copper and doubly gilded.</P>

<P>The whole, it is true, was anciently the King's Palace or Royal House, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up full as much Ground as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Palace, which I have given a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would do, except only the Gardens an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Space before it, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called Palace yard, is much greater tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that which would be at the North Gat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

of the Palace of White-hall, as proposed. The Gardens, indeed, were not large but not despicab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e neither, being the same where my Lord Hall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fax's House and Gardens now are, and too up all the Ground which we see now built upon be∣tw en the River and the Old Palace, where the Tellers of the Exchequer, as wel as the Audi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, have handsome Dwel∣lings and Gardens also.</P>
<P>But, alas! as I say, tho' they seem now even in their Ruins, great; yet com¦pared to the Beauty an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Elegancy of Mo∣dern Living, and of Royal Buildings in this Age, what are they!</P>
<P>The Royal Apartments, the Prince's Lodgings, the great Officers Apa tments, what are they now, but little Offices for Clerks, Rooms for Coffee-houses, Aucti∣ons of Pictures, Pamphlet and Toy∣shops?</P>
<P>Even St. Stephen's Chapel, formerly the Royal Chapel of the Palace, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lately beautifyed for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nvenience of the House of Commons, was a very in∣different Place, old and decayed: The House of Lords is a venerable old Place, indeed; but how mean, how incoherent▪ and how straitned are the several Avenues to it, and Rooms about it? the Matted Gallery, the Lobby, the back Way the King goes to it, how short are they all of the Dignity of the Place, and the Glory of a King of Great Britain, with the Lords and Commons, that so often meet there?</P>
<P>Some Attempts were made lately, to have restored the decrepid Circumstances of this Part of the Building, and O ders were given to Mr Benson, then Surveyor of the King's Buildings, to do his Part to∣wards it; but it was directed so ill, or un∣derstood so little, that some thought he was more likely to throw the old Fabrick down, than to set it to Rights, for which Ignorance and V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, 'tis said, some have not fared as they deserved</P>
<P>It is true, the Sitting of the Parliament is by the Order of the Houses themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, accommodated as well as the Place will admit; but how much more Beautiful it would be in such a Building▪ as is above contrived, I leave to the Contriver to de∣scribe, and to other People to judge.</P>
<P>Come we next to Westminster hall; 'tis true, it is a very noble G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck Building, Ancient, vastly large, and the finest Roof of its kind in England, being one hundred Feet wide; but what a wretc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Figure does it make without Doors; the Front, a vast P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acle o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pede<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, after the most Ancient, and almost forgotten Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hick Way of Working; the Building itself, re em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les nothing so much as a great Barn of Three hundred Feet long and real y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like a Barn at a Distance.</P>
<P>Nay▪ if we view the whole Building from w thout Doors, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like a great Pile of something, but a Stranger would be much a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to know what; and whe∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a House or a Church, or, in∣deed, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Churches; being hud∣dled all together, with diffe ing and distant Roofs, come higher, some lower, some standing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast and West, some North and South, and some one Way, and some another.</P>
<P>The Abbey, or Collegiate Church of Westminster, stands next to this; a vene∣rable old Pile of building, it is indeed, but so old and weak, that had it not been taken in Hand some Years ago, and great Cost bestowed in upholding and repairing it we might, by this Time have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alled it a Heap, not a P le▪ and not a Church, but the Ruins of a Church.</P>
<P>But it begins to st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd upon new Legs now and as they continue to Work upon the Repairs of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Face of the whole Building will, in a short while, be intirely New.</P>
<P>This is the Repository of the British Kings and Nobility, and very fine Monu∣ments are here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een over the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of our Ancient Monarchs; the Particulars are too long to enter into here, and are so many Times described by several Authors, that it woul be a vain Repetition to en∣ter upon it here; besides, we have by no means any Room for it.</P>
<P>The Monarchs of Great Britain are al∣ways Crown'd here, even King James II.
<PB REF="240"/>
submitted to it, and to have it perform'd by a Protestant Bishop. It is observable, that our Kings and Queens make always Two Solemn Visits to this Church, and very rarely if ever, come here any more, viz. to be Crown'd and to be Buried.</P>
<P>Two Things I must observe here, and with that I close the Account of it. 1. 'Tis very Remarkable, that the Royal Vault, in which the English Royal Fa∣mily was laid, was filled up with Queen Ann; so that just as the Family was ex∣tinct above, there was no Room to have buried any more below. 2. It is become such a Piece of Honour to be buried in Westminster-Abbey, that the Body of the Church begins to be crowded with the Bodies of Citizens, Poets▪ Seamen and Parsons, nay even with very mean Persons, if they have but any way made themselves known in the World; so that in Time, the Royal Ashes will be thus mingled with common Dust, that it will leave no Room either for King or com∣mon People, or at least not for their Monuments, some of which also are ra∣ther pompously Foolish, than Solid and to the Purpose.</P>
<P>Near to this Church is the Royal Free-School, the best of its kind in Eng∣land, not outdone either by Winchester or Eaton, for a Number of eminent Scholars.</P>
<P>The Aniquities of this Church, for it is very Ancient, are published by two or three several Authors; but are parti∣cularly to be seeu in <HI>Dugdale</HI>'s <HI>Mona∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icon.</HI> The Revenues of it were very great, and the Abbot sat as a Spi∣ritual Peer in the House of Lords. The Revenues are still very large, and the Dean is generally Bishop of Rochester; the Fate of the late Bishop I desire to bury with him, who is gone to Oblivion. The Dean and Chapter have still great Privileges as well as Revenues, and par∣ticularly the Civil Government, or Tem∣poral Jurisdiction of the City of West∣minster, is so far in them, that the High-Steward and the High-Bailiff are named by them absolutely, without any Re∣serve either to King or People. Their present High-Steward is the Earl of Arran, Brother to the late Duke of Or∣mond, and their High-Bailiff, is William Morris, Esq;</P>
<P>Being got into this Part of Westmin∣ster, I shall finish it as I go, that I may not return: 'Tis remarkable, that the whole City, called properly, Westmin∣ster, and standing on the South side of the Park, is but One Parish, and is the only City of one Parish in England. There is now another great Church e∣rected, or rather erecting, by the Com∣missioners for building fifty new Churches; but they have been strangely mistaken in the situation, which is a fenny marshy Ground, and it is not found so able to support the weight as, perhaps, they were told it would; I say no more. The Building was very curious, espe∣cially the Roof; but the Towers are not so beautiful as it is thought was intended, the Foundation not being to be trusted.</P>
<P>The Earl of Peterborough's House stands at the Extremity of the Buildings, and is the Point of Measurement for the Length of London, which from that House to Lime-house, is reckoned seven Miles and a Quarter, and some Rods: This House might have been a Moni∣tor for the Builders of the New Church, for they tell us it has sunk several Yards, since it was first built, tho' this I do not affirm.</P>
<P>There are three Chapels of Ease to St. Margaret's in this Part of Westmin∣ster, besides that, great Numbers of Peo∣ple go to the Abbey, so that there is no want of Churches. There is but One Meeting-house in this whole Part, which is called Calamy's Meeting, and was formerly supplied by Mr. Stephen Lobb, who, tho' a Dissenter, lived and died a Jacobite.</P>
<P>The Cottonian Library is kept here in an Ancient Building, near Westmin∣ster-Hall Gate; we were told it would it would be removed to the Royal Li∣brary, and then, that it would be re∣moved
<PB REF="241"/>
to a House to be built on Pur∣pose; but we see neither yet in Hand. This is one of the most valuable Col∣lections in Britain, and▪ the Bodleian Library excepted, is perhaps, the best: It has in it some Books and Manuscripts invaluable for their Antiquity; but I have not Room so much as to enter upon giving an Account of the Parti∣culars.</P>
<P>This Part of Westminster has but one Street, which gives it a Communication with London, and this is called King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treet, a long, dark, dirty and very in convenient Passage; but there seems to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e no Remedy for it for most Passen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t out of it through th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vy Gar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, and some be private Passages into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Park, as at Locket's, at the Cock <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, and the new Gate from Queen's-Square; but these are all upon Suffer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce.</P>
<P>From hence we come through two ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y handsome, tho' ancient Gates▪ into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen Palace before White Hall and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eting-house,</P>
<P>Having mentioned White Hall already, have nothing more to say of it, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at it was, and is not, but may revive.

<P>From thence we come to the Horse Guards, a Building commodious enough, built on Purpose as a Barrack for a l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge Detachment of the Horse Guards, who keep their Post here, while attending on Duty; over it are Offices for Payment of the Troops, and a large Court of Judi∣cature▪ for holding Councils of War, for Tryal of Deserters and others, according to the Articles of War.</P>

<P>From this Part of the Town, we come into the publick Streets, where nothing
<PB REF="242"/>
more remarkable than the Hurries of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he People; Charing-Cross is a mixture of Court and City; Man's Coffee-house is the Exchange-Alley of this Part of the Town, and 'tis perpetually throng'd with Men of Business, as the others are with Men of Play and Pleasure.</P>
<P>From hence advancing a little, we see the great Equestrian Statue of King Charles the first in Brass, a costly, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a curious Piece; however, it serves sufficiently, to let us know who it is, and why erected there. The Circumstances are Two, he faces the Place where his Enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Statue faces the broad Place before White-Hall, where the King was B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aded.</NOTE>tri∣umph'd over him, and triumphs, that is, tramples in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce where his <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Gibet, where the R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g cides were Executed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ood just where the Statue now stands.</NOTE>Mur∣therers were hang'd.</P>
<P>From this Place d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e North, are the King's Stables▪ called the Meuse, where the King's Horses, especially his Coach-Horses, are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept, and the Coaches of State are set up; it is a very large Place and takes up a great deal of Ground▪ more than is made Use of; It contains Two large Squares, besides an Out-let E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st▪ were is the Managerie for teaching young Gentlemen to Ride the great Saddle; in the middle of the first Court is a Smith or Farryer's House and Shop, a Pump and Horse-Pond; But, lately a noble Building has been erected by the Command of King George the 2d for Stables for his Majestys Horses, the like not to be paral∣leled in Europe for Statelyness and Beau∣ty.</P>
<P>On the right Side of the Street, com∣ing from White-Hall, is Northumberland-House, so called, because belonging to the Northumberland Family for some Ages; but descending to the Duke of Somerset in Right of Marriage, from the late Dutch∣ess, Heiress of the House of Piercy.</P>
<P>'Tis an Ancient, but a very good House, the only Misfortune of its Situation is, its standing too near the Street; the back Part of the House is more Moderen and beautiful than the Front, and when you enter the First Gate, you come into a noble Square fronting the fine Lodgings: 'Tis a large and very well design d Build∣ing, and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to receive a Ret<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nue of one hundred in Family; nor does the Duke's Family come so far short of the Number, as not very handsomely to fill the House.</P>

<P>Advancing hence to the Hay Market, we see, F st, the great New Theatre, a very magnificent Building, and perfectly accommodated for the End for which it was buil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tho' the Entertainment there of late, has been chiefly Operas and Balls.</P>
<P>These Meetings are called BALLS, the Word Masqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rade not being so well re∣lished by the English, who, tho' at first fond of the Novelty, began to be sick of the Thing on many Accounts: However, as I cannot in Justice say any Thing to recommend th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m▪ and am by no means, to make this Work be a Satyr upon any Thing; I choose to say no more; but go on.</P>
<P>From hence Westward and Northward, lie those vastly extended Buildings, which add so exceedingly to the Magnitude of the whole body and of which I have al∣ready said so much: It would be a Task to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great for this Work, to enter into a Description of all the fine Houses, or ra∣ther Palaces of the Nobility in these Parts: To touch them supersicially, and by halves, is too much to imitate what I complain of in others, and as I design a particular Account of all the Houses of the Nobi∣lity and Men of Quality in London, and the Country 15 Miles round, in a work

Endeavours of that Glorious Mar∣tyr, Dr. Ridley then Bishop of London, who never ceased moving his Charitable Master, the King, till he brought him to join in the Foundation.

<P>This hospital has received greater Be∣nefactions than S.

<P>Adjoining to this of S Thomas's, is lately laid a noble Foundation of a new hospital, by the charitable Gift and single Endowment of one Person and, perhaps, the greatest of its kind, next to that of Sutton's hospital, that ever was founded in this Nation by one Person, whether private or publick, not excepting the Kings themselves.</P>
<P>This is called Guy's hospital, being built and endowed at the sole Charge of one Mr. Thomas Guy, formerly a Bookseller in Lombard street▪ who lived to see the said hospital not only de∣sign'd, the Ground purchased and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ared▪ but the Building begun, and a considera∣ble Progress made in it.</P>
<P>It was not till this Gentleman died, that the World were told it was to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a separate hospital: but it was generally understood to have been i t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ward, or an Addition to the old hospital
<PB REF="245"/>
of St. Thomas's, for the Reception of such as were accounted incurable.</P>
<P>But when Mr. Guy died, his Will be∣ing made publick, it appeared, that it was really a separate independant and distinct Hospital, under distinct Governors, and for a separate Purpose, to wit, for receiv∣ing such poor Persons as have been dis∣missed from other Hospitals as incurable.</P>
<P>Nor are these restrained to the Patients of the adjoining Hospital of St. Tho∣mas only; but they are allowed to re∣ceive such from St. Bartholomew's also, and also from Bethlehem, only with this Restriction as to the latter, That the Number of Incurable Luna<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icks shall ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er exceed Twenty at a Time.</P>
<P>This Hospital is, by Mr. Guy's Will, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o consist of Two great Squares of Build∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gs, in which, besides the Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccommodation for necessary Servants <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Overseers, who must be lodg'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e House, such as Stewards.

<P>How Mr. Guy amass'd all this Wealth, having been hmmself in no publick Em∣ployment or Office of Trust, or Profit▪ and only carrying on the Trade of a Book<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eller t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l within a few Years of his Death, that is not the Business of this Book; 'tis enough to say▪ he was a thriv∣ing frugal Man▪ w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o God was pleased exceedingly to Bless, in whatever he set his hand to, knowing to what good Pur∣poses he laid up his Gains: He was never Married, and lived to be above Eighty Years old; so that the natural Improve∣ments of this Money, by common Inte∣rest, after it was first grown to a consi∣derable Bulk, greatly increased the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.</P>

<P>There are Three considerable Charities given by private Persons in the City of Westminster, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gray coat Hospital, Founded by a generous Subscription o Contributi∣on; but chiefly by the Charity of one—Sands, Esq; It maintains 70 Boys and 40 Girls▪ cloathed▪ fed▪ and taught, and in some measure provided for, by be∣ing put out to Trades.</P>

<P N="3">3. The Emanuel Hospital, Founded by the Lady Ann Dacres, for Ten poor Men, and Ten poor Women, in the Forty-third Year of Queen Elizabeth. Near this, are Seven several S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tts of Alms houses; but not of any Magnitude to be called Hospitals.</P>
<P>There has been, also, a very noble Hospital erected by Contribution of the French Refuge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, for the Maintenance of their Poor: It stands near the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use, in the Foot-way to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slington in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h of Cripplegate, and Two Ranges of new Alms-houses in Kingsland Road beyond Shoreditch Church.</P>

The fine new Church of St M r∣tin's in the Fields, with a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e Steeple, which they tell us is 215 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high, all wholly built by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that great Parish, and finished <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the utmost Expedition.</P>

St. Thomas's Hospital in Southwark, and is a most magnificent Building.</P>
<P>Two large Wings to the Hospital of Bedlam, appointed also for Incurables; proposed first by the charitable Disposi∣tion of Sir William Withers, deceased.</P>
<P>A large new Meeting-house in Spittle∣fields for the Sect of Dissenters, call'd Baptists, or Antepaedo Baptists.</P>
<P>The South Sea House in Threadn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edle∣street, the old house being intirely pul∣led down, and several other houses ad∣joining being purchased, the whole Build∣ing was new from the foundation.</P>
<P>Several very fine new Churches, be∣ing Part of the Fifty Churches appoint∣ed by Act of Parliament, viz. One in Spittle fields, one in Radcliff-High-way, one in Old street, one at Lime house, with a very beautiful Tower, and one in Bloomsbury.</P>
<P>The Parish Church of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate, pulled down and Re▪built, by the Contribution of the Inhabitants, not as one of the fifty new Churches.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> In removing the Corpses buried in this Church, they found the Body of Sir <HI>Paul Pindar,</HI> buried there about Eighty Years before, which was ta∣ken up and deposited again; and we are told, a new Monument will be set up for him by the Parish, to which he was a good Benefactor.</P>
<P>The Custom-house, which since the late Fire in Thames-street, is very much in∣larged.</P>
<P>All these Buildings, in their several Places, be very great Ornaments to the City.</P>
<P>A new Street or Range of houses ta∣ken out of the South side of the Artille∣ry-Ground near Moor-Fields also an En∣largement to the new Burying-Ground as it was formerly called, on the North side of the same Ground.</P>
<P>The Iron Ballustrade, or as others call it, Balcony, on the Lanthorn▪ upon the Cupolo of St. Paul's Church, gilded. It was done at the Cost and as the Gift of an Irish Nobleman, who scarce lived to see it finished.</P>
<P>A new Bear-Garden, called Figg's Thea∣ter, being a stage for the Gladiators or Prize▪Fighters, and is built on the Ty∣burn Road.</P>

<P>I conclude this Account of London, with mentioning something of the Ac∣count of Mortality, that is to say the Births and Burials, from whence Sir Will. Petty thought he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight make some Cal∣culations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Numbers of the Inhabi∣tants, and I shall only take Notice, that whereas, the general Number of the Burials in the Year 1666, and farther back, were from 17000 to 19000 in a Year, the last yearly Bill for the Year 1723, amount as follows:</P>
<P>Christenings 19203. Burials 29197.</P>
<P>Here is to be observed that the Num∣ber of Burials exceeding so much the Number of Births, is, because as it is not the Number Born, but the Number Christen∣ed that are set down, which is taken from the Parisher Register; so all the Chil∣dren of Dissenters of every sort, Pro∣testant, Popish and Jewish and omitted, also all the Children of Foreigners, French, Dutch, &amp;c. which are Baptized in their own Churches, and all the Children of those who are so poor, that they can∣not get them Registred: So that if a due Estimate be made, the Births may be very well supposed to exceed the Burials one Year with another by many Thousands.</P>
<P>It is not that I have no more to say of London, that I break off here; but that I have no Room to say it, and tho' some Things may be taken Notice of
<PB REF="249" MS="y"/>
by others, which I have pass'd over; yet I have also taken Notice of so ma∣ny Things which others have omitted, that I claim the Ballance in my Favour.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY VI.</HEAD>
<P>I Have spent so much Time, and ta∣ken up so much room in my De∣scription of London, and the adja∣cent Parts, that I must be the more cautious, at least, as to needless Excur∣sions in the Country near it.</P>
<P>The Villages round London partake of the Influence of Lo don, so much, that it is observ'd as London is Encreased, so they are all Encreased also, and from the same Causes:</P>
<P>I have taken notice of this in my first setting out, and particularly in the Counties of Essex, Kent, and Surrey; and as the same appears to an extreme in Middlesex: I shall only give some Dis∣criptions, and say the less of the reason of it</P>
<P>Hackney and Bromley are the first Villages which begin the County of Middlesex, East; for Bow as reckon'd to S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epney, is a Part of the Great Mass. This Town of Hackney is of a great Extent, containing no less then 12 Hamlets <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> separate Villages, tho' some of them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow join, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Church street,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Hummerton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Wych-House,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Grove-street,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Clapton,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mare-street,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Well-street,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cambridge-Heath,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Shacklewell,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dalstone,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Kingsland,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Newington,</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All these, tho' some of them are very large Villages, make up but one Parish (viz.) of Hackney.</P>
<P>All these, except the Wych house, are within a few Years so increas'd in Build∣ings, and so fully inhabited, that there is no Comparison to be made between their present and past State: Every se∣parated Hamlet is Encreas'd, and some of them more than Treble as big as for∣merly: Indeed as this whole Town is∣included in the B lls of Mortality, tho' no where joining to London, it is in some respects to be call'd a part of it.</P>
<P>This Town is so remarkable for the retreat of Wealthy Citizens, that there is at this time near a hundred Coaches kept in it; tho' I will not join with a certain Satyrical Author, who said of Hackney, that there were <HI>more Coaches than Christians in it.</HI></P>
<P>Newington, Tottenham, Edmonton, and Enfield stand all in a Line North from the City; the encrease of Buildings is so great in them all, that they seem to a Traveller to be one continu'd Street; especially at Tottenham and Edmonton, and in them all, the New Buildings so far excetp the Old, especially in the value of them, and figure of the Inha∣bitants, that the fashion of the Towns are quite altered,</P>
<P><PB REF="250"/>
At Tottenham we see the remains of an Antient Building called the Cross, from which the Town takes the Name of High-Cross. There is a long Account of the Antiquities of this Place lately Published, to which I referr, Antiquities, as I have observed, not being my Province in this Work, but a Description of Things in their present State.</P>
<P>Here is at this Town a small but plea∣sant Seat of the Earl of Colerain, in Ire∣land; his Lordship is now on his Travails, but has a very good Estate here extend∣ing from this Town to Muzzle-hill, and almost to High gate.</P>
<P>The first thing we see in Tottenham is a small but Beautiful House, built by one Mr. Wanly, forme ly a Gold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mith, near Temple-Bar; it is a small House, but for the Beauty of the Building and the Gardens, it is not outdone by any of the Houses on this side the Country.</P>
<P>There is not any thing more fine in their Degree, than most of the Buildings this way; only with this Observation, that they are generally belonging to the middle sort of Mankind, grown Wealthy by Trade, and who still taste of London; some of them live both in the City, and in the Country at the same time: yet many of these are immensly Rich.</P>
<P>High-gate and Hamstead are next on the North-side; At the first is a very beautiful House built by the late Sir William Ashurst, on the very summit of the Hill, and with a view from the very lowest Windows over the whole Vale, to the City: And that so eminently, that they see the very Ships passing up and down the River for 12 or 15 Miles be∣low London. The Jews have particularly fixt upon this Town for their Country Retreats, and some of them are very Wealthy; they live there in good Figure, and have several Trades particularly de∣pending upon them, and especially, Burch∣ers of their own to supply them with Pro∣visions kill'd their own way; also, I am told, they have a private Synagogue here.</P>
<P>As the County does not extend far this way, I take notice of smaller Towns▪ nor is there any thing of Note but Citi∣zens Houses for several Miles; except that in the Chase, at Enfield is a fine Lodge formerly possest by the Earl of Denbigh; N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w we are told that General Pepper is fixt a Rnger of the Chase, and resides there.</P>
<P>This Chase was once a very beautiful Place, and when King James I. resided at Theobalds, which he loved for the Pleasure of his Hunting; it was then ve∣ry full of Deer, and all sorts of Game; but it has suffered several Depredations since that, and particularly in the late Pro∣tector's Usurpation, when it was utterly stript, both of Game and Timber, and let out in Farms to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enants, for the use of the Publick.</P>
<P>After the Restoration, it was reassum∣ed, and laid open again; Woods and Groves were every where Planted, and the whole Chase stored with Deer: But the young Timber which indeed began to thrive, was so continually Plundered, and the Deer-stealers have so Harrass'd the Deer, and both perhaps by those who should have preserved it, as well as by others, that the Place was almost ruined for a Forrest, and little but Hares and Bushwood was to be found in it. But now we hear, that by the Vigilance of General Pepper, the Chase is much re∣covered, and likely to be a Place fit for the Diversion of a Prince, as it has been before.</P>
<P>At a Village a little farther North, cal∣led Totteridge, Mr. Charleton of the Ord∣nance Office, has a very delicious Seat, the House new Built, and the Gardens ex∣tremely Fine: In the same Town the old E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of Anglesey had also a House, but not Extraordinary for any thing more than rural Situation, very retired, but yet very agreeable.</P>
<P>The Mineral Waters, or Barnet Wells, are a little beyond this House, on the De∣clivity of a Hill; they were formerly in great Request, being very much approved by Physicians; but of late, they began
<PB REF="251"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o decline, and are now almost forgotten: Other Waters at Islington, and at Ham∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tead having grown Popular in their stead.</P>
<P>Hampstead indeed is risen from a little Country Village, to a City, not upon the Credit only of the Waters, tho' 'tis ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arent, its growing Greatness began there; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Company increasing gradually, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople liking both the Place and the Diver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons together; it grew suddenly populous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Concourse of People wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> This consequently raised the Rate of Lodgings, and that encrea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Buildings, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Town grew up from a little Vil∣ge, to a Magnitude equal to some Cities; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r could the uneven Surface, inconveni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for Building, uncompact and unplea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, check the humour, of the Town, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even on the very steep of the Hill, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere there's no walking Twen y Yards <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e her, without Tugging up a Hill, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adling down a Hill▪ yet 'tis all one, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lding; encreased to that degree, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Town almost spreads the whole side the Hill.</P>
<P>On the Top of the Hill indeed▪ there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very pleasant Plain, called the Heath, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich on the very Summit, is a Plain of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a Mile every way, and in good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather 'tis pleasant airing upon it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Streets are extended so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat they begin to build, even on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Part of the Hill. But it must be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, 'tis so near Heaven that I dare say it can be a proper Situation, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but a race of Mountainers, who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to a ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ify'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nearer the second Region, than any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for 30 Miles round it.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is most beautiful Prospect indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e see here Hanslop Steeple one way, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is within eight Miles of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. W. to Landown-hill in Essex <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, East, at least 66 Miles from one another; the prospect to London, and beyond it to Bans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Downs, South▪ Shooters-hill, S. E. Red hill, S. W. and Windsor▪Castle, W. is also uninterrupted: Indeed due North, we see no farther than to Barnet, which is not above six Miles; but the rest i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sufficient.</P>
<P>At the Foot of this Hill is an old Seat of the Earls of Chesterfields, called Bell∣size; which for many Years had been neglected, and as it were forgotten: But being taken lately by a certain Projector to get a Penny, and who knew by what Handle to take the gay Part of the World, he has made i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a true House of Plea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; here, in the Gardens he entertained the Company with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kind of Sport and in the House with all kinds of Game▪ to say no more of it: This brought a wonder∣ful Concourse of People to the Place, for they were so effectually gratified in all sorts of Diversion, that the Wicked part at length broke in, till it alarm'd the Ma∣gistrates, and I am told it has been now in a manner suppress'd by the hand of Justice.</P>
<P>Here was a great Room fitted up with abundance of Dexterity for their Balls, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad it gone on to a degree of Mas∣querading, as I hear was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctualy begun, it would have bid fair to have ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> half the Town run to it: One s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Pictures and Furniture there beyond what was to have been expected in a me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Publick House; and 'tis hardly credible how it drew Com∣pany to it; But it could not be, no British Government could be supposed to bear long with the Liberties taken on such Publick Occasions▪ So as I have said, they are reduc'd, at least <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estrained from Liberties which they could not preserve by their Prudence.</P>
<P>Yet Hampste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d is not much the sess fre∣quented for this. But as there is (especi∣ally at the Wells) a Conflux of all Sorts of Company, even Hampsteadit less has suf∣fered in its good Name; and you see some∣times more Gallantry than Modesty: So that the Ladies who value their Reputati∣on, have of late more avoided the Wells
<PB REF="252"/>
and Walks at Hampstead, than they had formerly done.</P>
<P>I could not be at Hampstead, and not mak e an Excursion to Edgworth, a lit∣tle Market Town, on the Road to St. Albans; I say to St. Albans, because 'tis certain, that this was formerly the only or the main Road from London to St. Albans; being the famous High Road, called Watling-street, which in former times reached from London to Shrews∣bury▪ and on towards Wales.</P>
<P>The Remains of this Road are still to be seen here, and particularly in this, viz. That from Hyde Park Corner, just where Tyburn stands, the Road makes one straight Line without any turning, even to the very Town of St Albans In this Road lies the Town of <HI>St▪</HI> Al∣bans. In this Road lies the Town of Edgworth▪ some will have it that it was built by King Edgar the Saxon Monarch, and called by his Name, and so will have the Town called Edgar, and that it was built as a Garrison on the said Watling∣street to preserve the highway from Thieves: But all this I take to be fabu∣lous, and without Authority.</P>
<P>Near this Town, and which is the rea∣son of naming it, the present Duke of Chandos has built a most Magnificent Pa∣lace or Mansion house, I might say the most Magnificent in England: It is erec∣ted where formerly stood an old seat be∣longing to Sir Lancelot Lake, whose son and successor struggled hard to be chosen Representative for the Country, but lost it, and had a great Interest and Estate hereabouts.</P>
<P>This Palace is so Beautiful in its situ∣ation, so Lofty, so Majestick the Appear∣ance of it, that a Pen can but ill describe it, the Pencil not much better; 'tis only fit to be talk'd of upon the very spot, when the Building is under View to be consider'd in all its Parts.</P>
<P>The Fronts are all of Freestone, the Columns and Pilasters are Lofty and Beautiful, the Windows very high, with all possible Ornaments: The Pilasters running flush up to the Cornish and Archi∣trave, their Capitals seem as so many supporters to the fine Statues which stand on the Top, and crown the whole; in a word, the whole Structure is built with such a Profusion of Expence, and all finish'd with such a Brightness of Fancy, Goodness of Judgment; that I can assure you, we see many Palaces of Sovereign Princes abroad, which do not equal it, which yet pass for very fine too either within or without. And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is a noble and well contriv'd Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣ing; so it is as well set out, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ornament is wanting to make it the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> house in England. The Plastering and Gilding is done by the famous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Italian, said to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in those particular Works now in Eng∣land The great Salon o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hall is pain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lucci,</HI> for the Duke spared no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have every thing as rich as possible The Pillars, supporting the building an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all of Marble: The great Stair case <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the finest by far of any in England; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the steps are all of Marble, ever▪ step be∣ing of one whole Piece, about 22 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Length.</P>
<P>Nor is the splendor which the pre∣sent Duke lives in at this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ace, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beneath what such a Building calls fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and yet, so far is the Duke from h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ving exhausted himsef by this Prod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a Building; that we see him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that laying out a scheme, and storin, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Materials for Building another house <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his City Convenience, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> side of the New Square, call'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Cavendish Square, near Maryboa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and if that is discontinued, it seems be so, only because the Duke found Opportunity to purchase another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more to his Advantage; Namely▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Duke of Ormond's house in St. Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Square.</P>
<P>It is in▪ vain to attempt to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Beauties of this Building at Cann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the whole is a Beauty, and as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a Glorious Mantle fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or as it were made up of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

of lesser Glories the Stars; so every part of this Building adds to the Beauty of the whole. The Avenue is spacious and majestick, and as it gives you the view of two Fronts, join'd as it were in one, the Distance not admitting you to see the Angle, which is in the Centre; so you are agreeably drawn in, to think the Front of the house almost twice as large as it really is.</P>
<P>And yet when you come nearer you are again surprized, by seeing the Wind∣ing Passage opening as it were a new Front to the Eye, of near 120 Foot wide, which you had not seen before, so that you are lost a while in looking near hand for what you so evidently saw a great off. Tho' many of the Palaces in Italy are very large fine Buildings, yet I venture to say, not Italy it self can show such a Building rais'd from the common Surface, by one private <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, and in so little a time as this: For Cau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons as I was inform'd, was not three Years a building and bunging the Gardens and all, to the most finish'd Beauty we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow see it in.</P>

<P>The inside of this House is as Glori∣s, as the outside is Fine; the Lodgings <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indeed most exquisite'y finish'd, and I may call it so, royally furnish'd; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Chapel is a Singularity, not only in Building, and the Beauty of its Work∣manship, but in this also, that the Duke maintains there a full Choir, and has the Worship perform'd there with the best Musick, after the manner of the Chappel Royal, which is not done in any other Nobleman's Chappel in Britain; no not the Prince of Wales's, though Heir Apparent to the Crown.</P>
<P>Nor is the Chappel only furnish'd with such excellent Musick, but the Duke has a Set of them to entertain him every Day at Dinner.</P>
<P>The Avenues and Vista's to this House are extreamly Magnificent, the great Walk of chief Avenue is near a Mile in length, planted with two double Rows of Trees, and the middle Walk broad enough for a Troop of Horse to march in Front; in the middle way there is a large Basin or Fountain of Water and the Coaches drive round it on either side; there are three other Avenues exceeding fine, but not so very large; the Beauty of them all will double with time, when the Trees may be grown, like those of New-Hall, in Essex.</P>
<P>Two things extreamly add to the Beau∣ty of this House, namely, the Chappel, and the Library; but I cannot enlarge, having taken up so much Room in the View of this House, as must oblige me to abate in Others, to whom I am willing to do what Justice I can.</P>
<P>In his Gardens and Out houses the Duke keeps a constant Night▪Guard, who take ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the whole Place, duly walk the Rounds, and constantly give the hour to the Family at set appointed Places and Times; so that the House has some waking Eyes about it, to keep out Tkieves and Spoilers Night and Day. In a Word, no Nobleman in England, and very few in Europe, live in greater Splendor, or maintains a Grandeur and Magnificence, equal to the Duke of Chandos.</P>
<P>Here are continually maintained, and that in the dearest Part of England, as to House Expences, not less than One Hundred and Twenty in Family, and yet a Face of Plenty appears in every Part of it; nothing needful is with-held,
<PB REF="254"/>
nothing pleasant is restrained; every Ser∣vant in the House is made easy, and his Life confortable; and they have the Feli∣city that it is their Lord's Desire and De∣light that it should be so.</P>
<P>But I am not writing Panegyrick. I left Cannons with regreat, the Family all Gay, and in Raptures on the Marriage of the Marquis of Caernarvon, the Dukes eldest Son, just then Celebrated with the Lady Katharine Ta mash Daughter of the Earl of Dysert, which Marriage adds to the Honour and Estate also of the Family of Chandos.</P>
<P>Two Mile from hence, we go up a small A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cant by the great Road which for what reason I know not, is there cal∣led Crab Tree Orchard, when leaving the Street Way on the Right, we enter a Spa∣cious Heath or Common call'd Bushy∣heath, where▪ again, we have a very a∣greeable Prospect.</P>
<P>I cannot but remember, with some Satis∣faction, that having two Foreign Gentle∣men in my Company in our passing over this Heath, I say I could not but then ob∣serve, and now remember it with Satis∣faction, how they were surprized at the Beauty of this Prospect, and how they look'd at one another, and then again turn∣ing their Eyes every way id a kind of Wonder, one of them said to the other, That England was not like other Coun∣try's▪ but it was all a planted Garden.</P>
<P>They had there on the right Hand, the Town of St. Albans in their View; and all the Spaces between, and further beyond it, look'd indeed like a Garden. The in∣clos'd Corn-Fields made one grand Par∣terre, the thick planted Hedge Rows, like a Wilderness of Labyrinth, divided in Espa∣liers; the Villiages interspers'd, look'd like so many several Noble Seats of Gentle∣men at a Distance. In a Word, it was all Nature, and yet look'd all like Art; on the left Hand we see the West End of London, Westminster Abbey▪ and the Par∣liament-house, but the Body <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the City was cut off by the Hill, at wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h Hamp∣stead intercepted the Sight on that side.</P>

<P>St. Albans is the Capital Town, tho' not the County Town of H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o dshire, it has a great Corn Market and is famous for its antient Church, built on the Ruins, or part of the Ruins of the most famous Abbey of Verulam; the Greatness of which, is to be judg'd by the old Walls, which one fees for a Mile before we come to Town.</P>
<P>In this Church, as some Workmen were digging for the Repairs of the Church, they found some Steps which led to a Door in a very thick Stone Wall, which being opened, there was discover'd an arched Stone Vaulr, and in the middle of it a large Coffin near 7 Foot long, which being open'd, there was in it the Corps of a Man, the Flesh not bon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um'd, but discolour'd; by the Arms and other Paint∣ing on the Wad, it appear'd that this must be the Body of Humphry Duke of Glou∣cester, one of the Sons of Henry IV. and Brother to King Henry V. and by the most indisputable Authority, must have lain Buried there 277 Years</P>

<P>It was my hap formerly, to be at Ayles∣bury▪ when there was a mighty Conflu∣ence of Noblemen and Gentlemen, at a famous Horse Race at Quainton-Meadow, not far off, where was then the late Duke of Monmouth, and a great many Persons of the First Rank, and a prodigious Con∣course of People.</P>
<P>I had the Occasion to be there again in the late Queen's Reign; when the same Horse Rase which is continu'd Yearly, happen'd again, and then there was the late Duke of Marlborough, and a like Concourse of Persons of Quality: but the Reception of the two Dukes was mighti∣ly differing, the last Duke finding some Reasons to withdraw from a Publick Meet∣ing, where he saw he was not like to be used as he thought he had deserved.</P>
<P>The late Lord Wharton, afterwards made Duke, has a very good Dwelling at Winchenden, and another much finer nearer Windsor, call'd Ubourn. But I do not hear that the present Duke has made any Additions, either to the House or Gardens; they were indeed admirably fine before and if they are but kept in the same Condition, I shall think the Dukes Care cannot be reproach'd.</P>
<P>Were there not in every part of Eng∣land at this Time so many fine Palaces, and so many Curious Gardens, that it would but be a Repetion of the same Thing to describe them; I should enter upon that Task with great Chearfulness here, as also at Clisden, the Earl of Ork∣ney's fine Seat built by the late D. of Buckingham, near Windsor, and at several other Places, but I proceed: We went on from Aylesbury to Thame or Tame, a large Market Town on the River Thames: This brings me to mention again the Vale of Aylesbury; which as I noted before, is eminent for the richest Land, and per∣haps the richest Graziers in England: But it is more particularly famous for the Head of the River Thame or Thames, which rises in this Vale near a Market Town call'd Tring, and waters the whole Vale either by itself or the several Streams which run into it, and when it comes to the Town of Tame, is a good large River.</P>
<P>At Tring abovenam'd is a most delici∣ous House, built a la Modern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as the French call it, by the late Mr. Guy▪ who was for many Years Secretary of the Treasury, and continued it till near his Death; when he was succeeded by the late Mr. Lowndes. The late King Wil∣liam did Mr. Guy the Honour to dine at this House, when he set out on his Ex∣pedition to Ireland, in the Year 1690, the same Year that he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought the Battle of the Boyn; and tho' his Majesty came from London that Morning, and was re∣solv'd to lye that Night at Northampton, yet he would not go away without taking a look at the fine Gardens, which are perhaps the best finish'd in the worst Situ∣ation of any in England. This House was afterwards bought by Sir William Gore, a Merchant of London; and left by him to his eldest Son, who now en∣joys it.</P>
<P>There was an eminent Contest here be∣tweed Mr. Guy, and the Poor of the Par∣ish, about his Enclosing part of the Com∣mon to make him a Park; Mr. Guy pre∣suming upon his Power, set up his Pales, and took in a large parcel of open Land, call'd Wiggington-Common; the Cattagers and Farmers oppos'd it, by their Com∣plaints a great while; but finding he went on with his Work, and resolved to do it, they rose upon him, pull'd down his Banks, and forced up his Pales, and car∣ried away the Wood, or set it on a Heap and burnt it; and this they did several Times, till he was oblig'd to desist; after some time he began again <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffering to treat with the People, and to give them any Equivalent for it: But that not being satis∣factory, they mobb'd him again. How
<PB REF="259"/>
they accommodated it at last, I know not; but I see that Mr. Gore has a Park, and a very good one but not large: I mention this as an Instance of the popular Claim in England; which we call right of Com∣monage, which the Poor take to be as much their Property, as a Rich Man's Land is his own.</P>
<P>But to return to the Vale of Aylesbury. Here the great and antient Family of Hampden flourish'd for many Ages, and had very great Estates: But the present H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i may (I doubt) be said, not to have had equal Success with some of his An∣cestors</P>
<P>From Thame, a great Corn Market, the Thame joins the other Branch call'd also the Thames, at a little Town called Dorchester. I observe that most of our Historians reject the Notion that Mr. Cambden make so many Folurishes about, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Marriage of Thame and Isss; that his lit le River was called the Thame, and he other, the Isss; and that being joined. hey obtained the united Name of Thamisis. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay they reject it, and so do▪ At this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town of Dorchester was once the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Bishopri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>incoln.</P>
<P>From hence I came to Oxford, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own throughout the Learned World; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity famous in our English History for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral Things, besides its being an Vni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sity.</P>
<P N="1">1. So Eminent for the goodness of its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Healthy Situation; that our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have no less than three Times, if Information is right, retired hither, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> London has been visited with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lence; and here they have been al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s safe.</P>
<P>It has also several Times been the eat of our Princes, when the rest of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingdom has been embroiled in War Rebellion; and here they have found Safety and Support; at least, as long <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Loyal Inhabitants were able to pro∣hem.</P>
<P>It was famous for the noble Defence eligion, which our first Reformers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tyrs made here, in their Learned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Disputations against the Papists, in behalf of the Protestant Religion; and their triumphant closing the Debates, by laying down their Lives for the Truths which they asserted.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was likewise famous for resisting the Attacks of Arbitrary Power, in the Affair of Magdalen College, in King James's II time; and the Fellows laying down their Fortunes, tho' not their Lives▪ in Defence of Liberty and Property.</P>
<P>This, to use a Scripture Elegance, is that City of Oxford; the greatest (if not the most A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>) University in this Island of Great Britain; and perhaps the most Flourishing at this Time, in Men of Polite Learning, and in the most accomplished Masters, in all Sciences, and in all the Parts of acquired Knowledge in the World.</P>
<P>I know there is a long Contest, and yet undetermin'd be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een the two English Universities, about the Antiquity of their Foundation; and as they have not decided it themselves, Who am I? and what is this Work? that I should pretend to enter up∣on that important Question, in so small a Trace?</P>
<P>It is out of Question, that in the large∣ness of the Place, the Beauty of Situati∣on, the Number of Inhabitants, and of Schollars, Oxford has the advantage But Fame tell us, that as Great and Applaud∣ed Men, as much recommended, and as much recommending themselves to the World and as many of them have been produced from Cambridge, as from Ox∣ford.</P>
<P>Oxford has several things as a Univer∣sity, which Cambridge has not▪ and Cam∣bridge ought not to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o meanly thought of, but that it has several things in it, which cannot be found in Oxford. For Example,</P>
<P>The Theater, the Museum, or Cham∣ber of Rarities, the Bodleian Library, the number of Colleges, and the Magnificence of their Buildings are on the side of Ox∣ford, yet Kings, College Chappel, and College, is in favour of Cambridge; for as it is now Edifying, it is likely to be
<PB REF="260"/>
the most admir'd in a few Years of all the Colleges of the Word.</P>
<P>I have said something of Cambridge; I ll be as brief about Oxford as I can: It is a noble Flourishing City, so possess'd of all that can contribute to make the Residence of the Scholars easy and comfortable, that no Spot of Ground in England goes be∣yond it. The Situation is in a delight∣ful Plain on the Bank of a fine Naviga∣ble River, in a plentiful Country, and at an easy Distance from the Capital City, the Port of the Country.</P>
<P>The City itself is large, strong, popu∣lous, and rich; and as it is adorn'd by the most beautiful Building of the Colle∣ges, and Halls, it makes the most noble Figure of any City of its Bigness in Eu∣rope</P>
<P>To enter into the Detail or Description of all the Colleges, Halls, &amp;c. would be to write a History of Oxford, which in so little a Compass as this Work can afford must be so imperfect, so superficial, and, so fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from giving a Stranger a true Idea of the Place▪ that it seems ridiculous, even to think it can be to any ones Sa∣tisfaction.

<P>As therefore I did in the speaking of Cambridge, I shall now give a Summary of what a Traveller may be suppos'd to observe in Oxford, <HI>en 'Passant,</HI> and leave the Curious inquirer to examine the Hi∣stories of the Place, where they may meet a compleat Account of every Part in the most particular manner, and to their full satisfaction.</P>
<P>There are in Oxford seventeen Colle∣ges, and seven Halls, some of these Col∣leges as particularly, Christ Church, Mag∣dalen, New College, Corpus Christi, Trin∣ity, and St. John's will be found to be equal, if not superior to some Universities abroad; whether we consider the Number of the Scholars, the greatness of their Re∣venues, or the Magnificence of their Buildings.</P>
<P>I thought my self oblig'd to give a more particular account of the Colleges here, than I have done of those at Cambridge; because some false and assuming Accounts of them have been publish'd by others, who demand them to be credited, and have impos'd their Accounts upon the World, without sufficient Authority.</P>
<P>Besides the Colleges▪ some of which are extremely fine and magnificent: There are some publick Buildings which make a most glorious Appearance: The first and greatest of all is the Theatre, a Building not to be equall'd by any thing of its kind in the World; no, not in Italy itself: Not that the Building of the Theatre here is as large as Vespasian's or that of of Trajan at Rome; niether would any thing of that kind be an Ornament at this time, because not at all suited to the Occasion, the uses of them being quite dif∣ferent.</P>

that the Protestant's Gifts are meerly Acts of Charity to the World, and Acts of Bounty, in Reverence to Learning and learned Men, without the grand Excitement of the Health of their Souls, and of the Souls of their Fathers, to be pray'd out of Purgatory and get a ready Admission into Heaven, and the like</P>
<P>Oxford, had for many Ages the Neigh∣bourhood of the Court while their Kings kept up the Royal Palace at Wood∣stock; which, tho' perhaps it was much discontinued, for the Fate of the fair Rosamond, Mistress to Henry F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>z Em∣press, or Henry II. of which History tells us something, and Fable much more; yet we after find that several of the Kings of England made the House and Park at Woodstock, which was always fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d for its pleasant Situation, the Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of their Summer Retreat for many Years. Also for its being a Royal Palace before, even beyond the certainty of History, there is abundant Reason to believe it; nay some will have it to have been a Royal House before Oxford was an University. Dr. Plot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> allows it to have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ever since King Alfred; and a Manuscript in the Cotton Library confirms it; and that King Henry I. was not the Founder of it▪ but only rebuilt it: And as for Henry II. he built only some Additions; namely, that they call'd the Bower, which was a Building in the Garden (or Labyrinth,) for the Entertainment and Security of his fair Mistress▪ of whose safety he was it seems very careful. Notwithstanding which the Queen sound means to come at her, and as Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es report, sent her out of the way by Poison.</P>
<P>The old Buildings are now no more, nor so much as the Name, but the Place is the same and the natural Beauty of it indeed, is as great as ever.</P>
<P>It is still a most charming Situation, and 'tis still disputable after all that has been laid out, whether the Country round gives more Lustre to the Building or the Building to the Country. It has now chang'd Masters, 'tis no more a Royal House or Palace for the King; but a mark of Royal Bounty to a Great, and at that time Powerful Subject, the late Duke of Marlborough.</P>
<P>The Magnificence of the Building does not here as at Canons, at Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>worth, and at other Palaces of the Nobility, express the Genius and the Opulence of the Pos∣sessor, but it represents the Bounty, the Gratitude, or what else Posterity pleases to call it, of the English Nation▪ to the Man whom they delighted to Honour▪ Posterity when they view in this House the Trophies of the Duke of Marlboroug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Fame, and the Glories of his great At∣chievements will not celebate his Name only; but will look on Blenheim House, as a Monument of the generous Temper of the English Nation; who in so glorious a manner rewarded the Services of those who acted for them as he did: Nor can any Nation in Europe shew the like Muni∣ficence to any General no nor the great∣est in the World; and not to go back to antient times, not the French Nation to the great Luxemberg, or the yet greater Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enne: Nor the Emperor to the great Eugene, or to the yet greater Duke of Lorrain; whose inimitable Conduct saved the Imperial City of Vienna, and rescued the whole House of Austria; retook the whole Kingdom of Hungary, and was Victorious in seventeen pitched Battles. I say none of these ever received so glo∣rious a Mark of their Country's Favour.</P>
<P>Again, It is to be considered▪ that not this House only, built at the Nation's Ex∣pence, was thus given; but Lands and Pensions to the value of above one hun∣dred thousand Pounds Sterl▪ and Honours the greatest England can bestow▪ These are all Honours indeed to the Duke, but i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ely more to the Honour of the Na∣tion</P>
<P>The Magnificent Work then is a Na∣tional Building, and must for ever be cal∣led so. Nay the Dimensions of it will perhaps call upon us hereafter, to own it as such in order to vindicate the Discretion of the Builder, for making a Palace too

<P>On the Churne one of those Rivers stands Cirencester, or Ciciter for brevity, a very good Town, Populous and Rich, full of Clothiers, and driving a great Trade in Wool; which as likewise at Tetbury, is brought from the Midland Counties of Leicester, Northampton, and
<PB REF="270"/>
Lincoln, where the largest Sheep in Eng∣land are found, and where are few Manu∣factures; it is sold here in quantities, so great, that it almost exceeds belief: It is generally bought here by the Clothiers of Wiltshire and Gloucester shire, for the supply of that great Clothing Trade; of which I have spoken already: They talk of 5000 Packs in a Year.</P>
<P>As we go on upon the Fosse, we see in the Vale on the left Hand, the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ieut Town of Malmsbary, famous for a Mon∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary, and a great Church, bui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t out of the Ruins of it; and which I name in meer veneration to that excellent, and even best of our Old Historians Guliel∣mus Malmsburiensis, to whom the World is so much obleg'd, for preserving the His∣tory and Antiquities of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>We next arrived at Marshifield, a Wilt∣shire Clothing Town, very flourishing▪ and where we cross'd the great Road from London to Brifrol, as at Circnccster, we did that from London, to Gloucester; and in the Evening keeping still the Fosse∣way, we arrived at Bath.</P>
<P>My Description of this City would be very short, and indeed it would have been a very small City, (if at all a City) were it not for the Hot Baths here, which give both Name and Fame to the Place.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of this Place, and of the Baths here, is doubtless very great, tho' I cannot come into the Inscription under the Figure, said to be of a British King, placed in that call'd the King's Bath, which says that this King Bladud, (Mr. Cambden calls him Blayden, or Blaydon Cloyth; that is, the South sayer) found out the use of these Baths, 300 Years before our Saviour's Time. I say, I cannot come into this, because even the Discovery is ascribed to the Magick of the Day, not their Judgment in the Physical Virtue of Minerals, and Mineral-waters.</P>
<P>The Antiquities of this Places are far∣ther treated of by Mr. Cambden, as the Virtues of the Waters, are, by several of the Learned Members of that Faculty, who have wrote largely on that Subject; as particuly, Dr. Dr. Baynard, Dr. and others.</P>
<P>There remains little to add, but what relates to the Modern Customs, the Gal∣lantry and Diversions of that Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I shall be very short; the best Pan being but a Barren Subject, and the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Part meriting rather a Satyr, than a De∣scription.</P>
<P>It has been observed before, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former Times this was a Resort hither fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cripples, and the Place was truly U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Aegrotorum Hominum: And we ice th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Crutches hang up at the several Baths, a the Thank offerings of those who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come hither Lame, and gone away Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But now we may say it is the Resort <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Sound, rather than the Sick; th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bathing is made more a Sport and Diver∣sion, than a Physical Prescription so Health; and the Town is taken up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Raffting, Gameing, Visiting, and in Word, all sorts of Gallantry and Levity.</P>
<P>The whole Time indeed is a Round <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the utmost Diversion.

On the N. W. of this City up a very steep Hill, is the King's Down, where sometimes Per∣sons of Quality who have Coaches go up for the Air: But very few People care to have Coaches here, it being a Place where they have but little room to keep them, and less to make use of them. And the Hill up to the Downs is so steep, that the late Queen Anne was extremely frighted in going up, her Coachman stopping to give the Horses Breath, and the Coach want∣ing a Dragstaff, run back in spight of all the Coachman's Skill; the Horses not being brought to strain the Harness again, or pull together for a good while and the Coach putting the Guards behind it into the utmost Confusion, till some of the Servants setting their Heads and Shoulders to the Wheels, stopt them by plain force.</P>
<P>When one is upon King Down, and has pass'd all the Steeps and Difficulties of the Ascent, there is a plain and pleasant Country for many Miles, into Gloucester∣shire, and two very noble Palaces, the one built by Mr. Blathwait, late Secretary of War; and the other is call'd Badminton, the Mansion of the most noble Family of the Dukes of Beaufort, the present Duke being under Age. The Lustre and Mag∣nificence of this Palace is magnify'd by the surprise one is at, to see such a House in such a Retreat, so difficult of Access, at least this way, so near to so much Com∣pany, and yet, so much alone,</P>
<P>Following the Course of the River A∣von, which runs thro' Bath, we come in Ten Miles to the City of Bristol, the greatest, the richest, and the best Port of Trade in Great Britain, London only ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>The Merchants of this City not only have the greatest Trade, but they Trade with a more entire Independency upon London, than any other Town in Britain. And 'tis evident in this particular, (viz) That whatsoever Exportations they make to any part of the World, they are able to
<PB REF="272"/>
bring the full returns back to their own Port, and can dispose of it there</P>
<P>This is not the Case in any other Port in England. But they are often oblig'd either to ship part of the Effects in the Ports abroad, on the ships bound to London; or to consign their own ships to London, in order both to get Freight, as also to dispose of their own Car∣goes.</P>
<P>But the Bristol Merchants as they have a very great Trade abroad, so they have always Buyers at Home▪ for their Returns, and that such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uyers that no Cargo is too big for them. To this Purpose, the Shopkeepers in Bristol who in general are all Wholesale Men, have so great an Inland T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong all the Western Counties, that they maintain Carriers just as the London Tradesmen do, to all the Principal Countries and Towns from Southampton in the South, even to the Banks of the Trent North; and tho' they have no Navigable River that way yet they drive a very great Trade through all those Countries.</P>
<P>Add to that, That, as well by Sea, as by the Navigation of two great Rivers, the Wye, and the Severn. They have the whole Trade of South-Wales, as it were to themselves, and the greatest Part of North-Wales; and as to their Trade to Ireland, it is not only great in it self, but is prodigiously encreas'd in these last Thirty Years, since the Revolution, not∣withstanding the great Encrease and En∣croachment of the Merchants at Liver∣pool, in the Irish Trade, and the great Devastations of the War, the Kingdom of Ireland it self being wonderfully encreas'd since that time.</P>
<P>The greateest inconveniences of Bristol, are, its situation, and the tenacious folly of its inhabitants; who by the general infatuation, the Pretence of Freedoms and and Privileges, that Corporation Tyranny, which prevents the Flourishing and E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣crease of many a good Town in Eng∣land, continue obstinately to forbid any, who are not subjects of their City So∣vereignty, (that is to say Freemen,) t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trade within the Chain of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Liberties; where it not for this, the City of Bristol, would before now, have swell and encreas'd in Building and inhabitants perhaps to double the Magnitude it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> formerly of.</P>
<P>This is evident by this one particular There is one remarkable part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the Liberties extend not at all, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but very little without the City Gate Here and no where else, they have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Accession of new Inhabitants; and abun¦dance of new Houses, nay, some S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are built, and the li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would have been at all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gates, if liberty had been given. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the City itself there is hardly room to set another House in it, 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> close built, except in the great Square the Ground about which is a little to subject to the hazard of Inundations So that People do not so freely enlarg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that way</P>
<P>The To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sey of this City, (so they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Exchange where their Merchan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> meet,) has been a Plaee too of grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Business, yet so straighten d, so crowd¦ed, and so many ways inconvenie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that the Merchants have been oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to do less Business there, than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Nature of their great Trade requires They have the efore long solicited, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient Authority of Parliament, em powering them to build a Royal E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦change; by which, I mean a Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> table and spacious, fit for the Acco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦modation of the Merchants, and for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dispatch of Business; and to be impowere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pull down the adjacent Buildings <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Purpose: But there is not muc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Progress yet mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Work tho'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finish'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would add much to the Beau¦ty of the City of Bristol.</P>
<P>The Hot Well, or the Water of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vincent's Rock▪ is not in the City, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Confluence of the two little Ri¦vers, and on the North S de of the Stream It is but a few Years since this Spring lay open at the Foot of the Rock, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="273"/>
was covered by the Salt Water at eve∣ry Tide, and yet it preserved both its Warmth and its Mineral Virtue entire.</P>
<P>The Rock tho' hard to Admiration, has since that been work'd down, part∣ly by strength of Art, and partly blown in Pieces by Gunpowder, and a plain Foundation made for building a large House upon it, where they have good Apartments for entertaining diseased Per∣sons. The Well is secur'd, and a good Pump fix'd in it, so that they have the Water pure and unmix'd from the Spring <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> self.</P>
<P>The Water of this Well possess'd its Medicinal Quality no doubt from its O∣riginal, which may be as ancient as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eluge. But what is strangest of all is, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it was never known before; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow famous for being a Specifick in that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therwise Incurable Disease the <HI>Diabetes;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd yet was never known to be so, till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithin these few Years; namely, thirty Years, or thereabout.</P>
<P>There are in Bristol 21 Parish Churches, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any Meeting houses, especially Quakers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne (very mean) Cathedral, the reason <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f which, may be, that it is but a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odern Bishoprick. It is supposed they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve an Hundred Thousand Inhabitants the City, and within three Miles of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Circumference; and they say above <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree Thousand Sail of Ships belong to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Port, but of the last I am not cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>Tis very remarkable, That this City so plentifully supply'd with Coals, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y are all brought by Land Carriage, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t yet they are generally bought by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inhabitants, laid down at their Doors, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Rate of from Seven to Nine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llings per Chaldron.</P>
<P>The Situation of the City is low, but the side of a rising Hill. The Ground <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it is said very much to resemble <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Old Rome, being Circular, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ething greater Diameter one way than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, but not enough to make it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And the River cutting off one small part, as it were, a Sixth, or less from the rest.</P>
<P>The Bridge over the Avon is exceed∣ing strong, the Arches very high, be∣cause of the Depth of Water, and the Buildings so close upon it, that in passing the Bridge, you see nothing but an en∣tire well built Street. The Tide of Flood rises here near six Fathom, and runs very sharp.</P>
<P>They draw all their heavy Goods here on Sleds, or Sledges without Wheels, which kills a Multitude▪ of Horses; and the Pavement is worn so smooth by them, that in wet weather the Streets are very slippery, and in frosty weather 'tis dan∣gerous.</P>
<P>From this City I resolved to Coast the Marshes or Border of Wales, especially South Wales, by tracing the Rivers Wye, and Lug, into Monmouth and Hereford∣shire. But I chang'd this Resolution on the following Occasion; namely, the badness and danger of the Ferries over the Severn, besides, having formerly tra∣vers'd these Counties, I can without a Re∣visit, speak of every thing that is consi∣derable in them, and shall do it in a bet∣ter by itself But in the mean time, I resolv'd to follow the Course of the fa∣mous River Severn, by which I should necessarily see the Richest, most Fertile, and most agreeable part of England; the Bank of the Thames only excepted.</P>
<P>From Bristol West, you enter the County of Gloucester, and keeping the Avon in view, you see King's Road, where the Ships generally take their Departure, as ours at London do from Gravesend and Hung Road; where they notify their Arrival, as ours for London do in the, Downs: The one lies within the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the other, in the open Sea or the Severn; which is there call'd the Severn Sea. In∣deed great part of Bristol is in the Bounds of Gloucestershire, tho' it be a County of itself. From hence going away a lit∣tle North West, we come to the Pill, a convenient Road for Shipping, and where
<PB REF="274"/>
therefore they generally run back for Ireland or for Wales. There is also a little farther, an ugly, dangerous, and very in∣convenient Ferry over the Severn, to the Mouth of Wye; namely, at Aust; the badness of the Weather, and the sorry Boats, at which, deterr'd us from crossing there.</P>
<P>As we turn North towards Gloucester, we lose the Sight of the Avon, and in about two Miles exchange it for an open view of the Severn Sea, which you see on the West side, and which is as broad as the Ocean there; except, that you see two small Islands in it, and that looking N. W. you see plainly the Coast of South Wales; and particularly a little nearer Hand, the Shore of Monmothshire. Then as you go on, the Shores begin to draw towards one another, and the Coasts to lye Parallel; so that the Severn appears to be a plain River, or an Aestuarium, somewhat like the Humber, or as the Thames is at the Nore, being 4 to 5 and 6 Miles over; and to give it no more than its just due a most raging, turbulent, furious Place. This is occasion'd by those violent Tides called the Bore, which slow here sometimes six or seven Foot at once, rolling forward like a mighty Wave: so that the Stern of a Vessel shall on a sud∣den be lifted up six or seven Foot upon the Water, when the Head of it is fast a Ground.</P>
<P>After Coasting the Shore about 4 Miles farther, the Road being by the low Salt Marshes, kept at a Distance from the Ri∣ver: We came to the Ferry called Ast Ferry▪ or more properly Aust Ferry, or Aust Passage, from a little dirty Village called Aust; near which you come to take Boat.</P>
<P>This Ferry lands you at Beachly in Monmouthshire, so that on the Out-side 'tis called Aust-Passage, and on the other Side, 'tis called Beachly-passage. From whence you go by Land two little Miles to Chepstow, a large Port Town on the River Wye. But of that Part I shall say more in its Place.</P>
<P>When we came to Aust, the hither Side of the Passage, the Sea was so Broad, the Fame of the Bore of the Tide so formidable▪ the Wind also made the Wa∣ter so rough▪ and which was worse, the Boats to carry over both Man and Horse appeared (as I have said above) so very mean, that in short none of us ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to venture: So we came back, and resolved to keep on the Road to Gloucester. By the Way we visited some Friends at a Market-Town, a little out of the Road, called Chipping-Sodbury, a Place of Note for nothing that I saw, but the greatest Cheese Market in all that Part of Eng∣land; or, perhaps, any other, except Atherstone, in Warwickshire.</P>
<P>Hence we kept on North, passing by Dursley to Berkley-Castle; the Antient Seat of the Earls of Berkley, a Noble tho' An∣tient Building, and a very fine Park about it. The Castle gives Title to the Earl, and the Town of Dursley to the Heir Appar∣ent; who during the Life of his Father, is called the Lord Dursley. I say no∣thing of the dark Story of King Edward II. of England; who, all our learned Writers agree, was murthered in this Castle: As Richard II. was in that of Pontefract, in Yorkshire; I say I take no more notice of it here, for History is not my present Business: 'Tis true they show the A∣partments where they say that King was kept a Prisoner: But they do not admit that he was killed there. The Place is rather Antient, than Pleasant or Health∣ful, lying low, and near the Water; but 'tis honour'd by its present Owner, known to the World for his many Services to his Country, and for a Fame, which our Posterity will read of, in all the Histories of our Times.</P>
<P>From hence to Gloucester, we see no∣thing considerable, but a most fertile, rich Country, and a fine River, but narrower as you go Northward, 'till a little before we come to Gloucester it ceases to be Navigable by Ships of Burthen, but con∣tinues to be so, by large Barges, above an Hundred Miles farther; not reckoning the Turnings and Windings of the River:
<PB REF="275"/>
Besides that, it receives several large and Navigable Rivers into it.</P>
<P>Gloucester is an antient middling City, tolerably built, but not fine; was fortify∣ed and stood out obstinately against its Lord King Charles the Ist. who besieged it to his great loss in the late Rebellion, for which it had all its Walls and Works demolish'd; for it was then very strong: Here is a large Stone Bridge over the Severn, the first next the Sea; and this, and the Cathedral is all I see worth Re∣cording of this Place. Except that the late Eminent and justly Famous Sir Tho∣mas Powel, commonly call'd Judge Powel, one of the Judges of the King's Bench Court; and Contemporary with Sir John Holt lived and dyed in this City, being one of the greatest Lawyers of the Age.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an old venerable Pile, with very little Ornament within or with∣out, yet 'tis well built; and tho' plain, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes together, especially the Tower, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery handsome Appearance. The Inha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itants boast much of its Antiquity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell us, that a Bishop and Preachers were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laced here, in the very Infancy of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hristian Religion; namely, in the Year 89. But this I take ad referendum The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athedral they tell us, has been three mes burnt to the Ground.</P>
<P>The first Protestant Bishop of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch, was, that truly Reverend and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eligious Dr. John Hooper. Set up by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng Edward VI. and afterwards Mar∣r'd for his Religion in the Marian Ty∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any: Being burnt to Death in the Ci∣tary of his own Cathedral.</P>
<P>The whispering Place in this Cathedral, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for many Years pass'd for a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder; but since, experience has taught the easily comprehended Reason of the ing: And since there is now the like the Church of St. Pauls, the Wonder much abated.

<P>From Gloucester we kept the East Shor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Severn, and in Twelve Miles came to Tewksbury, a Large and very Popul∣ous Town situate upon the River Avon, this is call'd the Warwickshire Avon, to distinguish it from the Avon at Bristol and others, for there are several Rivers in England of this Name; and some tell us that Avona was an old Word in the Brit∣ish Tongue signifying a River.</P>
<P>This Town is famous for a great Ma∣nufacture of Stockings, as are also, the Towns of Pershore, and Evesham, or Esham; on the same River.</P>
<P>The great old Church at Tewksbury may indeed be called the largest private Parish Church <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n England; I mean, that is not a Collegiate or Cathedral Church. This Town is famous for the Great, and as may be said, the last Battle, fought be∣tween the two Houses of Lancaster and York, in which Edward IV. was Con∣queror; and in, or rather after which, Prince Edward the only surviving Son of the House of Lancaster, was kill'd by the cruel Hands of Richard the King's Bro∣ther; the same af erwards Richard III. or Crookback Richard. In this Place be∣gins that fruitful and plentiful Country which was called the Vale of Esham, which runs all along the Banks of the Avon, from Tewksbury, to Pershore, and to Stratford upon Avon, and in the South Part of Warwickshire; and so far, (viz to Stratford,) the River Avon is navigable.</P>
<P>At this last Town, going into the Pa∣rish Church, we saw the Monument of old Shakespear, the famous Poet, and whose Dramatick performances so justly maintain his Character among the Bri∣tish Poets; and perhaps will do so to the End of Time. The Busto of Head is in the Wall on the North Side of the Church and a flat Grave-Stone covers the Body, in the Isle just under him. On which grave-Stone these Liues are written.</P>

<P>The Navigation of this River Avon is an exceeding advantage to all this part of the Country, and also to the Commerce of the City of Bristol. For by this Ri∣ver they drive a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead, and in a word, all heavy Goods which are carried by Water almost as far as Warwick; and return the Corn, and es∣pecially the Chease, is brought back from Gloucestershire and Warwickshire, to Bri∣stol.</P>
<P>This same Vale continuing to extend it self in Warwickshire, and under the Ridge of little Mountains call'd Edge-Hill, is there call'd the Vale of Red-Horse. All the Grounds put together, make a most pleasant Corn Country, es∣pecially remarkable for the goodness of the Air, and fertility of the Soil.</P>
<P>Gloucestershire must not be pass'd over, without some account of a most pleasant and fruitful Vale which crosses part of the Country, from East to West on that Side of the Cotswold, and which is call'd Strood-Water; famous not for the finest Cloths only, but for dying those Cloths of the finest Scarlets, and other Grain Colours that are any where in England; perhaps in any Part of the World: Here I saw two Pieces of Broad Cloth made, one Scarlet, the other Crimson in Grain, on purpose to be presented, the one to his Majesty King George, and the other to the Prince; when the former was Elector of Hanover, and the latter, Elec∣toral Prince: And it was sent to Ha∣nover, presented accordingly, and very graciously accepted. The Cloth was va∣lued including the Colour, at 45 s. per Yard: Indeed it was hardly to be valued, nothing so rich being ever made in Eng∣land before, at least as I was informed.</P>
<P>The Clothiers lie along the Banks of this River for near 20 Miles, and in the Town of Stroud, which lies in the mid∣dle of it, as also at Paynswick, which is a Market Town at a small Distance North. The River makes its way to the Severn about 5 Miles below Gloucester.</P>
<P>From Tewkesbury we went North 12 Miles, to Worcester, all the way still on ths Bank of the Severn; and here we had the pleasing Sight of the hedge Rows, being fill'd with Apple Trees and Pear Trees▪ and the Fruit so common, that any Passenger as they travel the Road may gather and eat what they please; and here, as well as in Gloucestershire, you meet with Cyder in the Publick-Houses sold as Beer and Ale as in the other Parts of England, and as cheap.</P>
<P>Here we saw at a distance, in a most agreeable Situation, the Mansion or Seat of Sir John Packington a Baronet of a very ancient Family; and for so long from Father to Son Knight of the Shire for the Country; that it seems as if it were Here∣ditary to that House.</P>
<P>On the other Side of the Severn at—and near the Town of Bewdly the Lord Foley has a very noble Seat suitable to the Grandeur of that rising Family.</P>
<P>Worcester is a large, populous, old, tho' not a very well built City; I say not well built because the Town is close and old, the Houses standing too thick. The North part of the Town is more extended and also better built. There is a good old Stone Bridge over the Severn, which stands exceeding high from the Surface of the Water. But as the Stream of the Severn is contracted here by the Buildings on either Side, there is evident occasion sometimes for the height of the Bridge, the Waters rising to an incredible height in the Winter Time.</P>
<P>It narrowly escap'd Burning, but did not escape Plundering at the time when the Scots Army commanded by King Charles II. in Person, was attack'd here by Cromwell's Forces; 'twas said some of the Royalist's Officers themselves, propos'd setting the City on Fire, when
<PB REF="277"/>
they saw it was impossible to avoid a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efeat, that they might the better make Retreat; which they propos'd to do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Severn, and so march into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ales: But that the King, a Prince from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Youth, of a generous and merciful <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isposition would by no means consent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it.</P>
<P>I went to se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Town-House, which forded nothing worth taking notice of, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it be how much it wants to be ended with a new one; which the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they say, is not so much enclin'd, they are able and rich to perform. I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing of publick notice there, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three Figures, (for they can hardly call'd Statues) of King Charles I. King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arles II. and Queen Anne</P>
<P>The Cathedral of this City is an ancient, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indeed, a decay'd Building; the Body <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Church is very mean in its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nor did I see the least Ornament <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it, I mean in the out side. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is low, without any Spire, only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very small Pinnacles on the Corners; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet the Tower has some little Beauty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more than the Church itself too; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upper part has some Images in it, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by time.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he inside of the Church has several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ancient Monuments in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some Royal ones; as that of King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who lies interr'd between two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bishops, namely, St Oswald, and Woolastan.

<P>What honour, or that any honour re∣dounds to that most Noble Order, from its being so deriv'd from the Garter of a—For 'tis generally agreed, she was the King's Mistress, I will not en∣quire.</P>
<P>Certainly the Order receives a just Claim to the Title of Most Noble, from the Honour done it, by its Royal Insti∣tution; and its being compos'd of such a Noble List of the Kings and Princes as have been entred into it: I say, cer∣tainly this Order has a just Title to that of Noble, and Most Noble too; yet I cannot but think that the King might have found out a better Trophy to have fix'd it upon, than that Lady's Garter. But this by the way: Here lies the La∣dy that's certain, and a very fine Monu∣ment she has, in which one thing is more ridiculous than all that went be∣fore, viz. That about the Monument, there are several Angels cut in Stone, strewing Garters over the Tomb, as if that Passage, which at best had some∣thing a little Obscene in it, I mean of the Kings taking up the Lady's Garter, and giving such honours to it, was also a thing to be celebrated by Augels, <HI>in per∣petuam rei memoriam.</HI></P>

There are several other antient Monu∣ments in this Church, too many to be set down here; They reckon up 99 Bishops of this Diocess, beginning at the Year 980, out of which Catalogue they tell us have been furnish'd to the World, 1 Pope, 4 Saints, 7 High-Chancellors of England, 12 Arch-Bishops, 2 Lord Treasurers of England, 1 Chancellor to the Queen, 1 Lord President of Wales, and 1 Vice President: Their Names are as follows.</P>

<P>This City is very full of People, and the People generally esteem'd very rich, being full of Business, occasion'd chiefly by the Cloathing Trade, of which the City and the Country round carries on a great Share, as well for the Turkey Trade as for the Home Trade:</P>
<P>The Salt Springs in this County which were formerly esteem▪d as next to mira∣culous, have since the Discovery of the Mines of Rock Salt in Lancashire, Che∣shire, &amp;c. lost all of Wonder that belong∣ed to them, and much of the Use also; the Salt made there being found to be much less valuable than what is now made of the other. So I need say little to them.</P>
<P>Near this City are the famous Maul∣vern Hills, or Mauvern Hills, seen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o far every way. In particular, we saw them very plainly on the Downs, Be∣tween Marlborough and Malmsbury; and they say they are seen from the top of Salisbury Steeple, which is above <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Miles.</P>
<P>There was a famous Monastery at the Foot of these Hills, on the S. W. Side, and the Ruins are seen to this Day; the old Legend of Wonders perform'd by the Witches of Mauvern, I suppose they mean the Religiouse of both kinds, are too merry, as well as too antient for this Work.</P>
<P>They talk much of Mines of Gold and Silver, which are certainly to be found here, if they were but look'd for, and that Mauvern wou'd out do Potosi for Wealth; but 'tis probable if there is such Wealth, it lies too deep for this idle Ge∣neration to find out, and perhaps to search for.</P>

<P>From Worcester I took a Tour into Wales, which tho' I mentioned above. it was not at the same time with the rest of my Journey; my Account I hope will be as effectual.</P>
<P>In passing from this Part of the Coun∣try to make a Tour through Wales, we necessarily see the two Counties of Here∣ford and Monmouth, and for that reason <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reserved them to this Place, a, I shall the Counties of Chester and Salop to my return.</P>
<P>A little below Worcester the Severn re∣ceives a River of a long Course and deep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hanel, call'd the Teme, and going from Worcester we past this River at a Village called Broadways; from whence keeping <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little to the North, we come to Ludlow Castle, on the Bank of the same River. On another Journey I came from Stour∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ridge, famous for the Clay for melting <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots as above; thence to Kidderminster, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd passing the Severn at Bewdley we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame to Ludlow, on the side of Shrop∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hire.</P>
<P>In this Course we see two fine Seats <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot very far from the Severn, (viz) the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord Foley's, and the Earl of Bradford's, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s we had before a most delicious House, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elonging to the Lord Conway, now in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Family of the late Famous Sir Ed∣ward Seymour.

<P>The Castle of Ludlow shows in its De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, what it was in its flourishing Estate: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the Palace of the Princes of Wales, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is, to speak more properly, it is an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Principality of Wales; which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Appenage of the Heir Apparent, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd this is his Palace in right of his be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g made Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>The Situation of this Castle is most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eautiful indeed; there is a most spacious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Lawn in its Front, which former∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> continu'd near two Miles; but much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is now enclosed. The Country round it is exceeding pleasant, fertile, popnlous, and the Soil rich; nothing can be added by Nature to make it a Place fit for a Royal Palace: It only wants the Residence of its Princes, but that is not now to be expected.</P>
<P>The Castle itself is in the very Per∣fection of Decay, all the fine Courts, the Royal Apartments, Halls, and Rooms of State, lye open, abandoned and some of them falling down; for since the Courts of the President and Marches are taken away, here is nothing to do that requires the Attendance of any publick People; so that Time, the great Devourer of the Works of Men, begins to eat into the very Stone Walls, and to spread the Face of Royal Ruins upon the whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>The Town of Ludlow is a tolerable Place, but it decays to be sure with the rest, It stands on the Edge of the two Countries, Shropshire, and Worcestershire, but is itself in the first; 'tis on the Bank of the Teme, over which it has a good Bridge, and it was formerly a Town of good Trade; the Weleh call this Town Lye Twysoe, which is in English, the Prince's Court. Mr. Cambden calls, the River Teme the Tem'd, and another River which joyns it just at this Town, the Corve, whence the rich flat Country below the Town is call'd Corvesdal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII. Established the Court of the President here, and the Council of the Marches and all Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of nisi prius, or of Civil Right were try'd here, be∣fore the Lord President and Council; but this Court was entirely taken away by Act of Parliament in our Days, and this, as above tends to the sensible Decay of the Town as well as of the Castle.</P>
<P>From Ludlow we took our Course due South to Lemster, or Leominster, a large and good trading Town on the River Lug▪ This River is lately made Navigable by act of Parliament, to the very great Pro∣fit of the trading Part of this Country, who have now a very gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for their Corn, Wool, and oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this Place, into the River Wye▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Wye, into the Severn, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P><PB REF="282"/>
Leominster has nothing very remark∣able in it, but that it is a well built, well inhabited Town: The Church which is very large, has been in a manner Re∣built, and is now, especially in the in∣side a very beautiful Church; This Town, besides the fine Wool, is noted for the best Wheat, and consequently the finest Bread; whence Lemster Bread, and Weobly Ale, is become a proverbial saying.</P>
<P>The County on our right as we came from Ludlow is very fruitful and plea∣sant, and is call'd the Hundred of Wig∣more, from which the late Earl of Oxford at his Creation, took the Title of Baron of Wigmore: And here we saw two an∣cient Castles, viz Brampton Brian, and and Wigmore Castle, both belonging to the Earl's Father, Sir Edward Harley: Brampton is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arely Pile, but not kept in full repair, the fate of that ancient Fa∣mily not permitting the Rebuilding it as we were told was intended Yet it is not so far decay'd as Ludlow, nor is it abandoned, or like to be so, and the Parks are still very fine, and full of large Timber.</P>
<P>We were now on the Borders of Wales, properly so call'd; for from the windows of Brampton Castle, you have a fair Pros∣pect into the County of Radnor, which is, as it were, under its walls; nay, even this whole County of Heref rd, was, if may believe Antiquity, a part of Wales, and was so esteem'd for many Ages. The People of this County too, boast that they were a part of the ancient Silures, who for so many Ages withstood the Ro∣man Arms, and who could never be en∣tirely conquer'd. I observ'd they are a diligent and laborious People, chiefly ad∣dicted to Husbandry, and they boast, perhaps, not without reason, that they have the finest Wool, the best Hops, and the richest Cyder in all Britain.</P>
<P>Indeed the Wool about Leominster, and in the Hundred of Wigmore observ'd a∣bove, and the Golden Vale as 'tis call'd for its richness on the Banks of the River Dove, (all in this County) is the finest without Reception, of any in England, the South Down Wool not excepted: As for Hops, they plant abundance indeed all over this County, and they are very good. And as for Cyder, here it was that several times for 20 Miles together, we cou d get no Beer or Ale in their Publick Houses, only Cyder; and that so very good, so fine, and so cheap, that we never found fault with the exchange; great quan∣tities of this Cyder are sent to London <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Land Carriage tho' so very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which is an Evidence for the Good uses of it, beyond contradiction.</P>
<P>One would hardly expect so pleasan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and fruitfull a Country as this, so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Barren Mountains of Wales, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certain, that not any of our Southe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the neighbourhood of London except<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> comes up to the Fertility of this Count As Gloucester furnishes London <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Quantities of Cheese, so this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> furnishes the same City with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in great Quantities, and also with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as above.</P>
<P>From Lemster it is 10 Miles to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the chief City, not of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only, but of all the Counties west Severn: 'Tis a large and a populous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and in the time of the late Rebelli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> was very strong, and being well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and as well defended, supporte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tedious and very siege; for besides Parliament Forces, who could never duce it, the Scots Army was call'd the work, who lay before it, till <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> laid above 4000 of their Bones <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and at last, it was rather taken by Fate of the war, than by the Attack of Besiegers▪</P>

There is nothing remarkable here that I could observe: But the Name putting me in mind of another Hamp∣ton-Court, so much beyond it, that the House seems to be a Foil to the Name; the House was built by Rowland L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣thal, Esq; who was Guard de Robe to Henry IV. so that it is old enough, if that may recommend it, and so is its Master.</P>
<P>From Hereford keeping the Bank of Wye as near as we could, we came to Ross, a good old Town, famous for good Cyder, a great Manufacture of Iron Ware, and a good Trade on the River Wye▪ and nothing else as I remember, except it was a monstrous fat Woman, who they would have had me gone to see But I had enough of the Relation, and so I suppose will the Reader, for they told me she was more than three Yards about her Waist; that when she sat down, she was oblig'd to have a small Stool plac'd before her, to rest her Belly on, and the like.</P>
<P>From hence we came at about 8 Miles more into Monmouthshire, and to the Town of Monmouth. It is an old Town situate at the Conflux of the Wye and of Munnow, whence the Town has its Name; it stands in the Angle where the Rivers join, and has a Bridge over each River, and a third over the River Tro∣thy, which comes in just below the other.</P>
<P>This Town shews by its Reverend Face, that it is a Place of great Anti∣quity, and by the remains of Walls, Lines, Curtains, and Bastions, that it has been very strong, and by its situation that it may be made so again: This Place is made famous, by being the Native Place
<PB REF="284"/>
of one of our most antient Historians Jeoffry of Monmouth. At present 'tis rather a decay'd than a flourishing Town, yet, it drives a considerable Trade with the City of Bristol, by the Navigation of the Wye.</P>
<P>This River having as I said, just re∣ceived two large Streams, the Mynevly or Munno, and the Trother is grown a very noble River, and with a deep Chanel, and a full Current hurries away towards the Sea, carrying also Vessels of a consi∣derable Burthen hereabouts.</P>
<P>Near Monmouth the Duke of Beaufort has a fine old Seat, call'd Troy; but since the Family has had a much finer Palace at Badminton, near the Bath; this tho' a most charming Situation seems to be much neglected.</P>
<P>Lower down upon the Wye stands Chep∣stow, the Sea Port for all the Towns seat∣ed on the Wye and Lug, and where their Commerce seems to center▪ Here is a Noble Bridge over the Wye: To this Town Ships of good Burthen may come up, and the Tide runs here with the same impetuous Current as at Bristol; the Flood rising from six Fathom, to six and a half at Chepstow Bridge. This is a Place of very good Trade, as is also Newport, a Town of the like Import upon the River Uske, a great River, tho' not so big as Wye; which runs thro' the Center of the County, and falls also into the Severn Sea.</P>
<P>This County furnishes great Quantities of Corn for Exportation, and the Bristol Merchants frequently loaded Ships here, to go to Portugal, and other Foreign Coun∣tries with Wheat; considering the Moun∣tainous Part of the West of this County, 'tis much they should have such good Corn, and so much of it to spare; but the Eastern Side of the County, and the Neighbour∣hood of Herefordshire, supplies them.</P>
<P>I am now at the utmost Extent of Eng∣land West, and here I must mount the Alps, traverse the Mountains of Wales, (and indeed, they are well compar'd to the Alps in the in-most Provinces; But with this exception, that in abundance of Places you have the most pleasant and beautiful Valleys imaginable, and some of them, of very great Extent, far exceed¦ing the Valleys, so fam'd among the Moun¦tains of Savoy, and Piedmont.</P>
<P>The two first Counties which bord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> West upon Monmouthshire, are Brecknock and Glamorgan, and as they are very Mountainous, so that Part of Monmouth¦shire which joyns them, begins the rising of the Hills.

<P>Brecknockshire is a meer Inland County, as Radnor is; the English jestingly (and I think not very improperly) call it Break∣neckshire: 'Tis Mountainous to an Ec∣tremity, except on the side of Radnor, where it is something more low and level. It is well watered by the Wye, and the Uske, two Rivers mentioned before; up∣on the latter stands the Town of Breck∣nock, the Capital of the County: The most to be said of this Town, is what indeed I have said of many Places, in Wales. (viz. that it is very antient, and indeed to mention it here for all the rest, there are more Tokens of Antiquity to be seen every where in Wales▪ than in any particular Part of England, except the Counties of Cumberland, and Nor∣thumberland. Here we saw Brecknock-Mere, a large or long Lake of Water, two or three Miles over; of which, they have a great many Welch Fables, not worth relating: The best of them is, that a cer∣tain River call'd the Lheweni runs thro' it, and keeps its Colour in Mid chanel distinguish'd from the Water of the Lake, and as they say, never mingles with it. They take abundance of good Fish in this Lake, so that as is said of the River Thysse in Hungary; they say this Lake is two thirds Water, and one third Fish. The Country People affirm, there stood a City once here, but, that by the Judg∣ment of Heaven, for the Sin of iis In∣habitants, it sunk into the Earth, and the Water rose up in the Place of it. I ob observe the same Story is mentioned by Mr. Cambden with some difference in the particulars: I believe my share of it, but 'tis remarkable, that Mr Cambden having lost the old City Loventium, mentioned by Ptolomy to be hereabouts, is willing to account for it, by this old Story</P>
<P>It was among the Mountains of this County that the famous Glendower shel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er'd himself, and taking Arms on the deposing Richad II. Proclaimed himself Prince of Wales; and they shew us se∣veral little Refuges of his in the Moun∣tains, whither he retreated; and fro whence, again, he made such bold Ex¦cursions into England.</P>
<P>Tho' this County be so Mountainou Provisions are exceeding Plentiful, an also very good all over the County; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are these Mountains useless, even to the City of London, as I have noted of o¦ther Counties; for from hence they sen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yearly, great Herds of Black Cattle t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> England, and which are known to fill ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fairs and Markets, even that of Smith field itself.</P>
<P>The yellow Mountains of Radnorshir▪ are the same, and their Product of Cattl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is the same; nor did I meet with any thing new, and worth noticing, excep Monuments of Antiquity, which are no the Subject of my Enquiry: The Stories of Vortigern, and Roger of Mortimer, are in every old Woman's Mouth here. There is here a great Cataract or Water Fall o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the River Wye, at a Place call'd Rhajad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gwy in Welch, which signifies the Cata∣ract or Water Fall of the Wye, but we did not go to see it, by reason of a great Flood at that time, which made the Way dangerous: There is a kind of Desart too on that side, which is scarce habitable o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> passable, so we made it our North Boun¦dary for this Part of our Journey, an turn'd away to Glamorganshire.</P>
<P>Entring this Shire, from Radnor an Brecknock, we were saluted with Monuc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣denny-Hill on our left, and the Black Mountain on the right, and all a Ridg of horrid Rocks and Precipices betwee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> over which, if we had not had trust Guides, we should never have found o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Way; and indeed, we began to reper our Curiosity, as not having met with an thing worth the trouble; and a Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> looking so full of horror, that w thought to have given over the Enterpris<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and have left Wales out of our Circnit But after a Day and a Night conversio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus with Rocks and Mountains, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Guide brought us down into a most agre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦able Vale, opening to the South, and pleasant River running through it, call'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the Taaffe; and following the Course of this River, we came in the Evening to the ancient City of Landaff, and Caer∣diff, standing almost together.</P>
<P>Landaff is the seat of the Episcopal See, and a City; but Cardiff which is lower on the River, is the Port and Town of Trade; and has a very good Harbour opening into the Severn Sea, about 4 Miles below the Town. The Cathedral is a neat Building, but very Ancient; they boast that this Church was a House of Religious worship ma∣ny Years before any Church was founded in England, and that the Christian Reli∣gion flourish'd here in its Primitive Pu∣rity, from the Year 186, till the Pela∣gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Heresy overspread this country; which being afterwards rooted out by the care of the Orthodox Bishop, they plac'd St. Dobricius as the first Bishop in this Town of Landaff, then call'd Taunton: 'Tis observable, that though the Bishop of Landaff was call'd an Arch-Bishop, yet the Cathedral Church was but 28 Foot long, and 10 Foot broad, and without any Steeple or Bells; notwith∣standing which the 3 first Bishops were afterwards Sainted, for their eminent Ho∣liness of Life, and the Miracles they wrought; nor had they any other Ca∣thedral from the year 386, to the year 1107, when Bishop Urban built the pre∣sent Church, with some Houses for the Clergy adjoining, in the Nature of a Cloyster.</P>
<P>Tho' the Church is ancient, yet the Building is good, and the Choir neat, and pretty well kept; but there are no Monuments of Note in it, except some so Ancient, that no Inscription can be read, to give any account of.</P>
<P>The South Part of this country is a pleasant and agreeable Place, and is very Populous; 'tis also a very good, fertile, and rich Soil, and the low Grounds are so well cover'd with Grass, and stock'd with Cattle▪ that they supply the City of Bristol with Butter in very great quanti∣ties salted and barrell'd up, just as Suffolk does the City of London.</P>
<P>The chief Sea Port is Swanzey, a ve∣ry considerable Town for Trade, and has a very good Harbour: Here is also a very great Trade for Coals and Culmn, which they Export to all the Ports of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, and al∣so to Ireland itself; so that one some∣times fees a hundred sail of Ships at a time loading Coals here; which greatly enriches the country, and particularly this Town of Swanvey, which is really a very thriving Place; it stands on the River Tawye, or Taw: 'Tis very re∣markable, that most of the Rivers in this County chime upon the Letters <HI>T,</HI> and <HI>Y,</HI> as <HI>Taaf, Tawy, Tay, Towy, Tyevy.</HI></P>
<P>Neath is another P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, where the Coal Trade is also considerable, tho' it stands farther within the Land. Kynfig Castle, is now the Seat and Estate of the Lord Mansel, who has here also a very Royal income from the Colleries: I say Royal, because equal to the Revenues of some Soverein Princes, and which formerly de∣nominated Sir Edward Mansel, one of the richest Commoners in Wales, the Fa∣mily was enobled by her late Majesty Q. ANNE.</P>
<P>In this Neighbourhood, near Margan Mynydd, we saw the famous Monument mentioned by Mr Cambden, on a Hill, with the inscription, which the People are so terrify'd at, that no body will care to read it; for they have a tradi∣tion from Father to Son, that whoever ventures to read it, will die within a Month. We did not scruple the Adven∣ture at all, but when we came to try, the Letters were so defac'd by time, that we were effectually secur'd from the Dan∣ger; the inscription not being any thing near so legible, as it seems it was in Camb∣den's time.</P>
<P>The Stone Pillar is about 4 or 5 Foot high, and 1 Poot thick, standing on the top of this Hill; there are seve∣veral other such Monuments in Rad∣norshire, and other Counties in Wales, as likewise in Scotland we saw the like: But as I have always said, I carefully avoid entering into any Discourses of
<PB REF="287"/>
any thing of Antiquity, as what the narrow compass of these Letters will not allow.</P>
<P>Having thus touch'd at what is most Curious on this Coast, we pass'd thro' the Land of Gowre, and going still West, we came to Caermarthen, or Kaer-Vyrh∣hin, as the Welsh call it, the Capital of the County of Kaermardhinshire.</P>
<P>This is an ancient but not a decay'd Town, pleasantly situated on the River Towy, or Tovy, which is Navigable up to the Town, for Vessels of a moderate Burthen. The Town indeed is well Built, and Populous, and the Country round it, is the most fruitfull of any part of all Wales, considering that it continues to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o for a great way, namely, thro' all the middle of the County, amd a great way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the next; nor is this County so Mountainous and Wild, as the rest of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Part of Wales; But it abounds in Coin, and in fine flourishing Meadows, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s good as most are in Britain, and in which are fed, a very great Number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood Cattle.</P>
<P>The Chancery, and Fxchequer of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rincipality, was usually kept at this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, till the Jurisdiction of the Court <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Matches of Wal s was taken away. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Town was also famous for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth of the old British Prophet MERLIN, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom so many things are sabled, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d nothing of its kind ever prevail'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far, in the Delusion of Markind, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o flourish'd in the Year 48<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: And here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the old Britains often kept their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rliament or Assemblies of their Wise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, and made their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aws The Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s fortify'd in former times, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls are scarcely to be seen now, only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ruins of them</P>
<P>Here we saw near Kily Maen Ibwyd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great Mountain a Circle of mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes, very much like Stone henge in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>hire, or rather like the Rollry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in Oxfordshire; and tho' the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> call it Bru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth Arthur, or King Ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, or King Arthur's Throne. We see <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reason to believe that King Arthur knew any thing of it, or that it had any relation to him.</P>
<P>We found the People of this County more civiliz'd and more courteous, than in the more Mountainous Parts, where the Disposition of the Inhabitans seems to be rough, like the Country: But here as they seem to converse with the rest of the World, by their Commerce, so they are more conversiue than their Neighbours.</P>
<P>The next County West, is Pembroke∣shire, which is the most extreme Part of Wales on this side, in a rich, fertile, and plentiful Country, lying on the Sea Coast, where it has the Benefit of Milford Ha∣ven, one of the greatest and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est inlets of Water in Britain Mr. Cambden says it contains 16 Creeks▪ 5 great Bays, and 13 good Road, for Shipping, all distin∣guish'd as such by their Names; and some say, a thousand Sail of Ships may ride in it, and not the Top Mast of one be seen from another; but this last, I think, merits Confirmation.</P>
<P>Before we quirted the Coast, we saw Tenbigh, the most agreeable Town on all the Sea Coast of South Wales, ex∣cept Pembroke, being a very good Road for Shipping, and well frequented: Here is a great Fishery for Herring in its Sea∣son, a great Colliery, or rather export of Coals, and they also drive a very consi∣derable Trade to Ireland.</P>
<P>From hence, the Land bearing far into the Sea, makes a Promontory, call'd St. Goven's Head or Point. But as we found nothing of moment was to be seen there, we cross'd over the Isthmus to Pembroke, which stands on the East Shore of the great Haven of Milford.</P>
<P>This is the largest and richest, and at this Time, the most flourishing Town of all South Wales: Here are a great ma∣ny English Merchants, and some of them Men of good Business; and they told us, there were near 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sail of ships belong'd to the Town, small and great, in a Word, all this Part of Wales is a rich and flourish∣ing County, but especially th s Part is so
<PB REF="288"/>
veay pleasant, and fertile, and is so well cultivated, that 'tis called by Distinction, Little England, beyond Wales.</P>
<P>This is the Place also made particular∣ly famous for the Landing of King Henry VII, then Duke of Richmond: From hence, being resolv'd to see the utmost Extent of the County West, we ferry'd over the Haven as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and went to Haverford, or by some call'd Haverford-West; and from thence to St. Davids, or St. Taffys, as the Welch call it. Haver∣ford is a better Town than we expected to find, in this remote Angle of Britain; 'tis Strong, well Built, Clean, and Po∣pulous.</P>
<P>From hence to St. Davids, the Country begins to look like Wales again, Dry, Barren, and Mountainous; St. Davids is not a Bishop's See only, but was former∣ly an Arch Bishop's, which they tell us, was by the Pope transferr'd to Dole in Britany, were it still remains.</P>
<P>The venerable Aspect of this Cathedral Church, shews that it has been a beauti∣ful Building, but that it is much decayed. The West End or Body of the Church is tolerably well; the Choir is kept neat, and in tollerable repair, the S. Isle with∣out the Choir, and the Virgin Mary's Chappel, which makes the E. End of the Church, are in a manner demolish'd, and the Roofs of both fallen in.</P>
<P>There are a great many eminent Per∣sons bury'd here, besides such, whose Monuments are defaced by Time, There is St. Davids Monument, to whom the Church is Dedicated, the Monument of the Earl of Richmond, as also of the fa∣mous Owen Tudor; there are also four antient Monuments of Knights Templars, known by their Figures lying cross Legg'd; but their Names are not known, and there are six several Monuments of Bishops, who ruled this Church, besides St. David.</P>
<P>This St. David they tell us was Uncle to King Arthur, that he lived to 146 Years of Age, that he was Bishop of this Church 65 Years, being born in the Year 496, and dyed Ann. 642; that he built 12 Monastaries, and did abundance of Miracles.</P>
<P>There was a very handsome House for the Bishop, with a College, all built in a Close by themselves, but they are now turn'd to Ruins.</P>
<P>Here the Weather being very Clear, we had a full View of Ireland, tho' at a very great Distance: The Land here is call'd St. Davids Head, and from hence, there has some time ago, gone a Passage Boat constantly between England and Ireland, but that Voitu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is at present discountinu∣ed. The reckon np 112 Bishops of this See, since it begun, 10 the Year 1712.</P>
<P>The last Bishop but two, was Dr. Tho. Watson, of whom the World has heard so much, being depriv'd after a long De∣bate, on a Charge of Simony; whether justly, or not, I shall not enquire, but he bestow'd great Sums on Charitable De∣signs, and is still (living) enclined as I am told, to do much more.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd N. keeping the Sea in our W. Prospect, and a rugged Mountainous Country on the E. where the Hills even darken'd the Air with their Heighth; as we went on, we past by Newport, on the River Nevern, a Town having a good Harbour, and consequently a good Trade with Ireland.</P>
<P>Here we left Pembrokeshire, and after about 22 Miles, came to the Town of Cardigan, an old and well Inhabited Town, on the River Tivy: 'Tis a very noble River indeed, and famous for its plenty of the best and largest Salmon in Britain.</P>
<P>The Country People told us, that they had Beavers here, which bred in the Lakes among the Mountains, and came down the Stream of Tivy to seed; that they de∣stroy'd the young Frye of Salmon, and therefore the Country People destroyed them; but they could shew us none of them, or any of their Skins, neither could the Countrymen describe them, or tell us that they had ever seen them; so that we concluded they only meant the Otter, till I found after our return, that Mr.
<PB REF="289"/>
Cambden mentions also, that there were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eavers seen here formerly.</P>
<P>This Town of Cardigan was once pos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss'd by the great Rober Fitl-Stephen, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho was the first Britain that ever at∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpted the Conquest of Ireland; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d such Success with a handful of Men, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> afterwards gave the English a footing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere, which they never quitted after∣wards, till they quite reduc'd the Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and made it, as it were, a Province of England.</P>
<P>The Town is not large, has been well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtify'd, but that Part is now wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eglected. It has a good Trade with Ire∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd and is enrich'd very much, as is all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Part of the Country, by the famous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead Mines, formerly discovered by Sir <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arbery Price, which are the greatest, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erhaps the richest in England; and par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ularly as they require so little Labour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Charge to come at the Oar, which in any Places lyes within a Fathom or two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Surface, and in some, even bare <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the very top.</P>
<P>Going N. from the Tivy about 25 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles, we came to Abryftwyth, that is say, the Town at the Mouth of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver Yyftwyth. This Town is enrich'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Coals and Lead which is found in Neighbourhood, and is a populous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a very dirty, black, smoaky Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d we fancy'd the People look'd as if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y liv'd continually in the Coal or Lead <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes. However, they are Rich, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place is very Populous.</P>
<P>The whole County of Cardigan is so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Cattle, that 'tis said to be the Nur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y or Breeding-Place for the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gdom of England, S. by Trent; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not a Proof of its Fertility, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the feeding of Cattle indeed requires <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich Soil, the breeding them does not, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mountains and Moors being as proper that purpose as richer Land.</P>
<P>Now we entered N. Wales, only I uld add, that as we pass'd, we had a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the famous Plymlymon-Hill, out the East Side of which as I mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, rises the Severn, and the Wye; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of the West Side of it, rises the Rydall and the Yyftwyth. This Moun∣tain is exceeding high, and tho' it is hard to say which is the highest Hill in Wales, yet I think this bids fair for it; nor is the County for 20 Miles round it, any thing but a continued ridge of Mountains: So that for almost a whole Weeks Travel, we seemed to be conversing with the up∣pet Regions; for we were often above the Clouds, I'm sure, a very great way, and the Names of some of these Hills seem'd as barbarous to us, who spoke no Welch, as the Hills themselves.</P>
<P>Passing these Mountains, I say we en∣tered N. Wales, which contains the Coun∣ties of Montgomery, Merionith, Caer∣narvon, Denbeigh, and Flint Shires, and the Isle of Anglesea.</P>
<P>In passing Montgomery shire, we were so tired with Rocks and Mountains, that we wished heartily we had kept close to the Sea Shore, but it not much mended the Matter if we had, as I understood afterwards: The River Severn is the only Beauty of this County, which rising I say, out of the Plymlymon Mountain, receives instantly so many other Rivers into its Bosom, that it becomes Navigable before it gets out of the County; namely, at Welch Pool, on the Edge of Shrop∣shire. This is a good fashionable Place, and has many English Dwelling in it, and some very good Families; but we saw no∣thing farther worth remarking.</P>
<P>The Vales and Meadows upon the Bank of the Severn, are the best of this County, I had almost said, the only good part of it; some are of opinion, that, the very Water of the Severn, like that of Nile, impregnates the Valleys, and when it overflows, leaves a Vertue behind it, par∣ticularly to itself; and this they say is confirmed, because all the Country is so fruitful wherever this River does over∣flow, and its Waters reach. The Town, or rather as the Natives call it, the City of Montgomery, lies not far from this River, on the outer edge of the Coun∣try next to Herefordshire. This was, it seems, a great Frontier Town iu the wars between the English and the Welch,
<PB REF="290"/>
and was beautify'd and fortify'd by King Henry III; the Town is now much de∣cay'd: It gives title to the eldest son of the Ducal House of Powis, who is call'd Lord Montgomery, and Marquis of Powis; they have a noble Seat at Troy, hard by this town on the other side the River: But the House of Pembroke also claims the title of Montgomery.</P>
<P>This County is noted for an excellent breed of Welch Horses, which, though not very large, are exceeding valuable, and much esteem'd all over England; all the North and West part of the County is mountainous and stony. We saw a great many old monuments in this coun∣try, and Roman camps wherever we came, and especially if we met any Per¦son curious in such things, we found they had many Roman coins; but this was none of my enquiry, as I have said already.</P>
<P>Merionithshite, or Merionydshire, lies West from Montgomeryshire; it lies on the Irish Sea, or rather the Ocean; for St. George's channel does not begin till further North, and it is extended on the coast, for near 35 miles in length, all still mountainous and craggy. The principal River is the Tovy, which rises among the unpassable mountains, which range along the center of this part of Wales, and which we call unpassable, for that even the People themselves call'd them so; we look'd at them indeed with Aston∣ishment, for their rugged Tops, and the immense Height of them: Some parti∣cular Hills have particular Names, but otherwise we called them all them all the black mountains, and they well de∣serv'd the Name; some think 'tis from the unpassable mountains of this Coun∣ty, that we have an old saying, that the Devil lives in the middle of Wales, tho' I know there is another meaning given to it; in a word, Mr. Cambden calls these Parts the Alps of Wales.</P>
<P>There is but few large Towns in all this Part, nor is it very Populous; in∣deed much of it is scarce Habitable, but 'tis said, there are more Sheep in it, in all the rest of Wales. On the Sea Shore however, we see Harleigh Castle, which is still a Garrison, and kept for the Guard of the Coast, but 'tis of no great strength, but by its situation.</P>
<P>In the middle of these vast mountains (and forming a very large Lake, viz. near its first Sources) rises the River De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, of which I shall speak again in its proper Place.</P>
<P>Here among innumerable Summits, and rising Peaks of nameless Hills, we saw the famous Kader-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dricks, which some are of Opinion, is the highest mountain in Britain; another call'd Rarauvau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, an∣no her call'd Mowylwynda, and still every Hill we saw, we thought was higher than all that ever we saw before.</P>
<P>We enquired here after that strange Phaenomenon which was not only seen, but fatally experinced by the Country round this Place, namely, of a livid Fire, coming off from the Sea; and setting on Fire, Houses, Barns, Stacks of Hay and Corn, and poisoning the Herbage in the Field; of which there is a full Account given in the Philosophical Tran∣sactions: And as we had it confirm'd by the general Voice of the People, I con∣tent my self with giving an Account of it as follows:</P>
<P>It is observable, that the Eclipses of the Sun in Aries, have been very fatal to this Place; for in the Years 1542, and 1567, when the Sun was Eclipsed in that Sign, it suffer'd very much by Fire; and after the latter Eclipse of the two, the Fire spread so far, that that a¦bout 200 Houses in the Town and Sub∣urbs of Caernarvon, were consum'd.</P>
<P>But to return to the face of things, as they appear'd to us, the mounta nous country spoken of runs away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> through this county and almost the next, I mean Caernarvonshire, where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hill is a monstrous Height, and according to its Name, had Snow on the Top in the be∣ginning of June; and perhaps had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o till the next June, that is to say, all the Year.</P>
<P><PB REF="291"/>
These unpassable heights were doubt∣less the Refuges of the Britains, when they made continual War with the Sax∣ons and Romans, and retreated on oc∣casion of their being over-power'd, into these Parts; where, in short, no Enemy could persue them.</P>
<P>That side of the Country of Carnarvon, which borders on the Sea, is not so mountainous, and is both more fertile and more populous. The principal Town in this Part, is Carnarvon, a good Town, with a Castle built by Edward I. to curb and reduce the wild People of the moun∣tains, and secure the Passage into An∣glesea. As this City was built by Edw. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so he kept his Court often here, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onour'd it with his Presence very much; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd here his eldest Son and Successor, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' unhappy, (Edward II) was born, who was therefore call'd Edward of Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnarvon This Edward was the first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rince of Wales; that is to say, the first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Kings of Englands Sons, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ested with the Title of Prince of Wales: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd here was kept the Chancery and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xchequer of the Prince's of Wales, or the N. part of the Principality, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was at—for the S Part. It is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all, but strong Town, clean and well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilt, and considering the Place, the Peo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le are very curteous and obliging to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rangers. It is seated on the Firth or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>let calll'd Menau, parting the Isle of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglesea, or Mona, from the main Land; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d here is a Ferry over to the Island <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled Abermenai Ferry: And from thence direct Road to Holly Head, where we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent for no Purpose, but to have an∣ther view of Ireland, tho' we were dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pointed, the weather being bad and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormy.</P>
<P>Whoever travels critically over these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountains, I mean of S. Wales, and Me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onithshire, will think Stone henge in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iltshire, and Roll-Rich Stones in Ox∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdshire no more a Wonder, seeing there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e so many such, and such like, in these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovinces; that they are not thought strange of at all, nor is it doubted, but they were generally Monuments of the Dead, as also are the single Stones of immense Bulk any other, of which we saw so many, that we gave over re∣marking them; some we saw from 7, 8, to 10, and one 16 Foot high, being a whole stone, but so great, that the most of the wonder is, where they were found, and how dragg'd to the Place; since, besides the steep Ascents to some of the Hills on which they stand, it would be impossible to move some of them, now, with 50 Yoke of Oxen. And yet a great many of these stones are found confusedly lying one upon another on the utmost summit or top of the Glyder, or other Hills, in Merionith and Caer∣narvonshire; to which it is next to im∣possible, that all the Power of Art, and Strength of Man and Beast could carry them, and the People make no difficulty of saying the Devil set them up there.</P>
<P>One of these monumental stones is to be seen a little way from Harleigh-Castle: It is a large stone lying slat, sup∣ported by three other stones at three of the four Angles, tho' the stone is rather oval than square, it is almost 11 Foot long, the breadth unequal, but in some places its from 7 to 8 Foot broad, and it may be suppos'd has been both lon∣ger and broader; 'tis in some places above 2 Foot thick, but in others 'tis worn al∣most to an Edge by Time: The three stones that support it, are about 20 In∣ches square, 'tis suppos'd there has been four, two of which that support the thickest End, are near 8 Foot high, the other not above 3 Foot, being suppos'd to be settled in the Ground, so that the stone lies sloping, like the Roof of a Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. There is another of these to be seen in the Isle of Anglesea, the flat Stone is much larger and thicker then this but we did not go to see it: There are also two circles of stones in that Island, such as Stone-henge, but the stones much larger.</P>

This is a particular kind of Monument, and therefore I took notice of it, but the other are generally single Stones of vast Magnitude, set up on one end, Column wise, which being so very large, are like∣ly to remain to the end of Time; but are generally without any Inscription, or re∣gular Shape or any Mark, to intimate for who, or for what they were so placed.</P>
<P>These Mountains are indeed so like the Alps, that except the Language of the People, one could hardly avoid thinking he is passing from Grenoble to Susa, or rather passing the Country of the Grisons. The Lakes also, which are so numerous here, make the Similitude the greater, nor are the Fables which the Country Peo∣ple tell of these Lakes, much unlike the Stories which we meet with among the Switzers, of the famous Lakes in their Country; Dr. Gibson, (Mr. Cambdens Continuator) tells us of 50 or 60 Lakes in Carnarvonshire only, we did not count them indeed, but I believe if we had, we should have found them to be many more.</P>
<P>Here we met with the Char Fish, the same kind which we see in Lancashire, and also in the Lakes of Switzerland, and no where else, that I have heard of in Europe; the Welch call it the Torgoch.</P>
<P>There is nothing of Note to be seen in the Ifle of Anglesea but the Town and the Castle of Beaumaris▪ which was also built by King Edward I▪ and call'd Beau-Marsh, or the Fine Plain; for here the Country is very level and plain, and the Land is fruitful and pleasant The Castle was very large, as may be seen by its re∣mains, and that it was strong; the Situa∣tion will tell also, but 'tis now of no use.</P>
<P>As we went to Holly Head, by the S. Part of the Island from Newborough, and came back thro' the middle to Beau∣maris, we saw the whole Extent of it, and indeed, it is a much pleasanter Conntry, than any part of N, Wales, that we had yet seen; and particularly is very fruitful for Corn and Cattle.</P>
<P>Here we cross'd the Fretum, or strait of Menou again, and came to Bangor, at the Place where King Edward I. intend∣ed to have built a great Stone Bridge, it wou'd indeed have been a Work fit for so great and powerful a King, as K. Edward was: But the Bottom being doubtful, and the Sea in that Place sometimes very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag∣ing and strong, the Workmen thought it impracticable, and tho' as we were told, that the King was very positive in his De∣sign for a great while, yet he was pre∣vail'd with at last to decline it.</P>
<P>From hence, I say, we cross'd to Ban∣gor, a Town noted for its Antiquity, its being a Bishops See, and an old, mean looking▪ and almost despicable Cathedral Church.</P>
<P>This Church claims to be one of the most Antient in Britain, the People say, 'tis the most Antient; that St. Daniel (to whom this Church was Dedicated) was first Bishop here, in the Year 512. They allow that the Pagans, perhaps of Angle∣sea, ruined the Church, and possess'd the Bishoprick after it was first built, for a∣bove 100 Years; nor is there any account of it from the Year 512, to 1009: Af∣ter this, the Bishoprick was ruined again by Dilapidation, by one of its own Bi∣shops, whose Name was Bulkeley, who, as the Monasticon says, not only sold the Revenues, but even the very Bells, for which Sacrilege he was struck Blind; but this last is a Tradition only.</P>
<P>It is certainly at present a poor Bishop∣rick, and has but a poor Cathedral; yet the Bishops are generally allowed to hold some other good Benefice in Commendam, and the Preferment seems to be a great∣ful Introduction to the Clergy, as the Bishops are generally translated from hence, to a more profitable Bishoprick.</P>
<P>From Bangor we went North, (keep∣ing the Sea on our left Hand) to Con∣way. This is the Poorest but Pleasantest Town in all this County for the bigness of it; it is seated on the Bank of a fine River, which is not only pleasant and beautiful, but is a noble Harbour for Ships,
<PB REF="295"/>
had they any occasion for them there; the Stream is Deep and Safe, and the Ri∣ver Broad, as the Thames at Deptford: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t only wants a Trade suitable to so good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Port, for it infinitely out does Chester or Leverpool itself.</P>
<P>In this Passage, we went over the fa∣mous Precipice call'd Penmen-muir, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed Fame has made abundance more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rightful, than it really is; for tho' the Rock is indeed very high, and if any one should fall from it, it wou'd dash them in Pieces, yet, on the other hand, there is no danger of their falling; and besides, there is now a Wall built all the way, on the Edge of the Precipice, to secure them: Those who have been at the Hill or Pass of Enterkin in Scotland, know very well, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Danger there is much greater, than what can be thought of here; as the fre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uent loss of Lives, both of Man and Horse will testify.</P>
<P>We have but little remarkable in the Road from Conway to Hollywell, but Craggs and Rocks all along the N. Shore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Denbeigh, till we came to Denbeigh Town. This is the County Town, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a large populous Place, which carries <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omething in its Countenance of its Neigh∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourhood to England, but that which was most surprizing, after such a tiresom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fatigeing Journey, over the unhospi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble Mountains of Merioneth, and Car∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arvonshire, was, that descending now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the Hills, we came into a most plea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, fruitful, populous, and delicious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale, full of Villages and Towns, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>elds shining with Corn, just ready for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Reapers, the Meadows green and slow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and a fine River, with a mild and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entle Stream running thro' it: Nor is it small or casual Intermission, but we had Prospect of the Country open before for above 20 Miles in Length, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m 5 to 7 Miles in Breadth, all smil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g with the same kind of Complexion; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich made us think ourselves in Eng∣land again, all on a sndden.</P>
<P>In this pleasant Vale, turning N. from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nbeigh, and following the Stream of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> River, we came to S Asaph, a small City, with a Cathedral, being a Bishoprick of tolerable good Value, though the Church is old: It is but a poor Town, and ill built, tho' the Country is so Pleasant and Rich round it. There are some old Mo∣numents in this Church, but none of any Note, nor could we read the Welch In∣scriptions.</P>
<P>From hence we come to Holly-well: The Stories of this Well of St Winifrid are, that the pious Virgin, being ravished and murthered▪ this healing Water sprung out of her Body when buried; but this smells too much of the Legend, to take up any of my time; the Romanists indeed believe it, as 'tis evident, from their thronging hither to receive the healing Sanative Virtue of the Water, which they do not hope for as it is a Medicinal Wa∣ter, but as it is a Miraculous Water, and heals them by virtue of the Intercession and Influence of this famous Virgin, St. Winifrid.</P>
<P>Here is a fine Chapel cut out of a sol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Rock, and was Dedicated to this Holy Virgin; and numbers of Pilgrims resort to it, with no less Devotion than Inno∣cence; under this Chapel the Water gushes out in a great Stream, and the Place where it breaks out, is form'd like a Bason or Cistern, in which they bathe: The Wa∣ter is intensely Cold, and indeed there is no great Miracle in that Point, consider∣ing the Rocks it flows from, where it is impregnated by divers Minerals, the Vir∣tue of which, and not of the Saint, I suppose, work the greatest Part of the Cures:</P>
<P>There is a little Town near the Well, which may, indeed, be said to have risen from the Confluence of the People hither, for almost all the Houses are either Pub∣lick Houses, or let into Lodgings; and the Priests that attend here, are very numerous, appear in Disguise: Sometimes they are Physicians, sometimes Surgeons▪ sometimes Gentlemen, and sometimes Patients, or any thing as occasion pre∣sents. No Body takes Notice of them, as to their Profession, tho' they know
<PB REF="296" MS="y"/>
them well enough, no not the Roman Catholicks themselves; but in private, they have their proper Oratory's in cer∣tain Places, whither the Votaries resort; and good Manners has prevail'd so far, that however the Protestants know who and who's together; no Body takes No∣tice of it, or enquires where one an∣other goes, or has been gone.</P>
<P>From hence we past by Flint-Castle, a known Place, but of no Significance; and then in a few Hours we cross'd the River Dee, and arriv'd at the City of West Chester, from whence, I shall give a farther Account of my Journey in my Next.</P>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY VII.</HEAD>
<P>I Have given you an Accouut of my Progress thro' Wales, and my coming to Chester, at the End of that really fatiguing Journey: I must confess, I that have seen the Alps, on so many Occasions, have gone under so many of the most frightful Passes in the Country of the Grisons, and in the mountains of Tirol, never believed there was any thing in this Island of Britain that came near, much less that exceeded those Hills, in the terror of their Aspect, or in the Difficulty of Access to them: But certainly, if they are out-done any where in the World, it is here: Even Hannibal himself wou'd have found it impossible to have marched his Army over Snowden, or over the Rocks of Merioneth and Montgomery Shires; no, nor with all the help that Fire and Vi∣negar could have yielded, to make way for him.</P>
<P>The only support we had in this heavy Journey, was, (1.) That we generally found their Provisions very good and cheap, and very good Accommodations in the Inns. (2.) That the Welc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentlemen are very civil, hospitable, and kind; the People very obliging and con∣versible, and especially to Strangers; but when we let them know, we travell'd merely in Curiosity to view the Coun∣try, and be able to speak well of them to strangers, their Civility was heighten∣ed to such a Degree, that nothing could be more Friendly, willing to tell us eve∣ry thing that belong'd to their Country, and to show us every thing that we de∣sired to see.</P>
<P>They value themselves much upon their Antiquity: The Ancient Race of their Houses, and Families, and the like; and above all, upon their Anicent Heroes. Their King Caractacus, Owen ap Tudor, Prince Lewellin, and the like Noblemen and Princes of British Extraction; and as they believe their Country to be the pleasantest and most agreeable in the World so you cannot oblige them more▪ than to make them think you believe so too.</P>
<P><PB REF="297"/>
The Gentlemen of Wales, indeed, justly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aim a very Antient Descent, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eserv'd their Families entire, for many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges: They receive you well into their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouses, treat you very handsomely, are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry generous; and indeed, nothing is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anting within Doors; and which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore than all, they have generally very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od Estates.</P>
<P>I continued at Chester for some time, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cept that I made two or three Excur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons into the Neighbouring Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d particularly into that Part of Shrop∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire which I had not view'd as I went; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also into the North, West <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt of Cheshire.</P>
<P>The first Trip I made, was into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estria Chersonesvs, as I think we may <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>operly call it, (viz.) a piece of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounty, which runs out a great way to the Irish Sea, and is bounded by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e two great Firths, or Arms of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a, the one call'd the Mouth of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, and the other of two Rivers, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersey, and the Wever; this Isthmus or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eck of Land, is about 16 Miles long, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d about fix or seven Miles over, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not one Market Town in it, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s exceeding rich and fertile; the last oc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sioned possibly by the Neighbourhood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two such great Towns, or Cities ra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er▪ I mean Chester and Liverpool.</P>
<P>Going down from Chester, by the Rhoo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, as they call it, that is, the Marshes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the River Dee, and Coasting the Ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r after it is grown broader than the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arshes; the first Place of any Note <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich we come to, is Nesson, a long <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase or Ness of Land, which running <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t into the Sea, makes a kind of a Key. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his is the Place where in the late War Ireland, most of the Troops embark'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen that Grand Expedition begun; af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r which, the Vessels go away to High∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, in which as the Winds may hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n they ride safe in their Way, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips from London lie in the Downs, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Wind presents for their respec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve Voyages.</P>
<P>From Nesson we cross'd over than fruitful Level I mentioned before, and coming to the other Water, we ferry'd over to Liverpool. This Town is now become so great, so populous, and so rich, that it may be call'd the Bristol of this Part of England: It had formerly but one Church, but upon the encrease of In∣habitants, and of new Buildings in so ex∣traordinary a Manner, they have built another very fine Church in the North Part of the Town; and they talk of erect∣ing two more.</P>
<P>The first thing we observ'd in this Church, was a fine Marble Font, all of one entire Stone, given to the Town, or Church rather, by the late Robert Hey∣sham, Esq; a Citizen and very consider∣able Merchant of London; who was ma∣ny years Representative for the Town of Lancaster. Here is a very fine new built Tower also, and in it a curious Ring of Eight, very good Bells.</P>
<P>This Part of the Town may indeed be call'd New Liverpool, for that, they have built more than another Liverpool that way, in new Streets, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine large Hou∣ses for their Merchants: Besides this, they have made a great Wet Dock, for laying up their Ships, and which they greatly wanted; for tho' the Mersey is a noble Harbour▪ and is able to ride a Thousand Sail of Ships at once, yet those Ships that are to be laid up, or lie by the Walls all the Winter, or longer, as sometime may be the Case; must ride there, as in an open Road, or (as the Seamen call it,) be haled a shore: neither of which wou'd be practicable in a Town of so much Trade: And in the time of the late great Storm, they suffer'd very much on that Account.</P>
<P>This is the only Work of its kind in England, except what is in the River of Thames, I mean for the Merchan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; nor is it many years since there was not one wet Dock in England for private use, ex∣cept Sir Henry Johnson's at Black Wall.</P>
<P><PB REF="298"/>
This is still an encreasing flourishing Town, and if they go on in Trade, as they have done for some time, 'tis pro∣bable it will in a little time be as big as the City of Dublin. The Houses here are exceeding well built, the Streets strait, clean, and spacious, and they are now well supplied with Water. The Mer∣chants here have a very pretty Exchange, standing upon 12 Free stone Columns, but it begins to be so much too little, that 'tis thought they must remove or enlarge it. They talk already as I have said a∣bove, of building two Churches more at Leverpool, and surrounding them with new Streets, to the N. E. of the old Town, which if they should, Leverpool will soon out do Bristol: In short, 'tis al∣ready the next Town to Bristol, and in a little time may probably exceed it, both in Commerce, and in Numbers of Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>We went no farther this way at that time, but came back to Chester, by the same Ferry as we went over.</P>
<P>As I am now at Chester, 'tis proper to say something of it, being a City well worth describing: Chester has four things very remarkable in it. 1. It's Walls, which are very firm, beautiful, and in good Repair. 2. The Castle, which is also kept up, and has a Garrison always in it. 3. The Cathedral. 4. The River Dee, and 5. the Bridge over it.</P>
<P>It is a very antient City, and to this Day, the Buildings are very old; nor do the Rows as they call them, add any thing, in my Opinion, to the Beauty of the City; but just the contrary, they serve to make the City look both old and ugly: These Rows are certain long Gal∣leries, up one pair of Stairs, which run along the side of the Streets, before all the Houses, tho' joined to them, and as is pretended, they are to keep the People dty in walking along. This they do in∣deed effectually, but then they take away all the view of the Houses from the Street, nor can a Stranger, that was to ride thro' Chester, see any Shops in the City; besides, they make the Shops them∣selves dark, and the way in them is dark, dirty, and uneven.</P>
<P>The best Ornament of the City, is, that the Streets are very broad and fair, and run through the whole City in strait Lines, crossing in the Middle of the City, as at Chichester: The Walls as I have said, are in very good Repair, and it is a very pleasant Walk round the City, upon the Walls, and within the Battlements, from whence you may see the Country round; and particularly on the side of the Roodee, which I mentioned before, which is a fine large low Green, on the Bank of the Dee. In the Winter this Green is often under Water by the Inundations of the River, and a little before I came there, they had such a terrible Land Flood, which flow'd 8 Foot higher than usual so that it not only overflowed the said Green, called the Roodee, but de∣stroy'd a fine new Wharf and Landing-Place for Goods, a little below the Town, bore down all the Warehouses, and other Buildings, which the Merchants had er∣ected for securing their Goods, and car∣ried all away Goods and Buildings toge∣ther, to the irreparable Loss of the Per∣sons concern'd: Also beyond the Roodee, one sees from the Walls, of Chester the County of Flint, and the Mountains of Wales, a Prospect best indeed, at a Dis∣stance.</P>
<P>The Castle of Chester is a good firm Building, and strong, tho' not fortify'd, with many out Works: There is always a good Garrison kept, and here the Pri∣soners taken at Preston, in the late time of the Rebellion, were kept a great while, till compassion to their Misery, mov'd the Clemency of the Conqueror to deliver them. They say this Castle was Built or at least Repaired by Hugh Lupus▪ the famous Earl of Chester, and Brother to William the Conqueror as also was the Church.</P>
<P>The great Church here is a very mag∣nificent Building, but 'tis built of a red, sandy, ill looking Stone, which takes
<PB REF="299"/>
much from the Beauty of it, and which yielding to the Weather, seems to crumble, and suffer by Time, which much defaces the Building: Here they shew'd us the Monument of Henry IV. Emperor of Germany; who they say, resign'd his Empire, and liv'd a Recluse here, but 'tis all to be taken upon trust, for we find nothing of it in History. We saw no Monument of any Note, which is partly occasioned by its remote Situation, and partly by its being but a Modern Bishop∣rick; for it was formerly a Part of the Diocess of Litchfield, and was not made a Bishop's See till the Year 1541; when King Henry VIII. divided it from Litch∣field; nor has there ever been above 19 Bishops of this See from its Foundation. The short Account of it is thus. Hugh Lupus gave the old Monastary Dedicated to St. Werburge, to a Society of Monks, aster which, they say, King Edgar who conquered all this Part of Britain, and was rowed up the Dee, in his Royal Barge, by four Kings, founded the great Church; and Hugh Lupus the Great, Earl of Chester, finished and endow'd it.</P>
<P>Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the Dee, very high and strong built, and 'tis needful it should be so, indeed; for the Dee is a most furious Stream at some Seasons, and brings a vast Weight of Wa∣ter with it from the Mountains of Wales. Here it was that the first Army of King William designed for the War in Ire∣land, and Commanded by the Great Duke Schomberg, encamped▪ for a considerable Time before they embark'd, Ann 1689.</P>
<P>Here according to the Monasticon, the said Hugh Lupus held his Parliament for the County Palatine of Chester, given him by William the Conqueror, and where he sat in as great State as the King himself. The Draught of which, as it is given us from Antiquity take as fol∣lows.</P>
<P>There are 11 Parishes in this City, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd very good Churches to them, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the largest City in all this Side of Eng∣land that is so remote from London. When I was formerly at this City, about the Year 1690, they had no Water to supply their ordinary Occasions, but what was carried from the River Dee upon Horses, in great Leather Vessels, like a Pair of Bakers Panyers; just the very same for Shape and Use, as they have to this Day in the Streets of Constantinople, and at Belgrade, in Hungery, to carry Water about the Streets to sell, for the People to drink But at my coming there this time, I found a very good Water∣house in the River, and the City plenti∣fully supplyed by Pipes, just as London is from the Thames; tho' some Parts of Chester stands very high from the Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>Tho' this is not an antient Bishoprick, 'tis an antient City, and was certainly a Frontier of the Roman Empire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his way; and its being so afterwards to the English Empire also, has doubtless been the rea∣son of its being so well kept, and the Castle continued in repair, when most of the other Castles on the Frontier <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> slighted and demolished.</P>
<P>This County, how ever remote from London, is one of those which contri∣butes most to its Support, as well as to several other Parts of England, and that is by its Excellent Cheese, which they make here in such Quantities, and so ex∣ceeding good, that as I am told from ve∣ry good Authority, the City of London only ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es off 14000 Ton every Year; besides 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 Ton which they say goes every Yer down the Rivers Seven and Trent, the former to Brist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, and the lat∣ter to York; including all the Towns on both these large Rivers: And besides the Quantity shiped both here, and at Lever∣pool, to go to Ireland, and Scotland. So that the Quantity of Cheese made in this Country, must be prodigious great. In∣deed, the whole County is employed in it, and part of its Neighbourhood too; for tho' 'tis all called by the Name of Cheshire Cheese, yet great Quantities of it are made in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Lancashire, that is to say, in such Parts of them as border upon Cheshire.</P>
<P><PB REF="300"/>
The Soil is extraordinary good, and the Grass they say▪ has a peculiar richness in it, which disposes the Creatures to give a great quantity of Milk, and that very sweet and good; and this Cheese Manufacture, for such it is, encreases every Day, and greatly enti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes all the County; raises the Value of the Lands, and encourages the Farmers to the keep∣ing vast stocks of Cows; the very Num∣ber of the Cattle improving and enrich∣ing the Land.</P>
<P>The East Part of the County abounds in Salt Springs from which they drew the Brine, and boyl it into fine Salt: and once it was a very considerable Trade, which they carried on with this Salt; but since the Discovery of the Rock Salt, which they dig in great quantities, to∣wards Warrington, the other Salt is not in so much request.</P>
<P>I now resolv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o direct my Course East, and making the Wever and the Trent, my Northern Boundary in this Circuit; I came forward to view the Midland Counties of England, I mean such as may be said to lye between th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thames and the Trent.</P>
<P>I had taken a little Trip into the N. E. Parts of Cheshire before, seen a fine old Seat of the Lord Delamere's, and which is beyond it all, the fine Forest, which bears the Name of that noble Family; intending to see the Salt Pits at North∣wich, which are odd indeed▪ but not so very strange as we were made to believe, the thing is, they say, the Salt Spring is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to be just perpendicularly under the Stream or Channel of a fresh Water River, namely, the Wever, and it is so for the Spring is very deep indeed in the Ground, but that very thing takes off the Wonder; for as the Earth under the Ri∣ver, is but as a Gutter to carry the Wa∣ter, there is no difficulty that it should not penetrate through it, the Soil being a strong Clay. So we came a way not ex∣tremely gratify'd in our Curiosity.</P>
<P>All the way as we cross'd this Part of the County, we see Beeston Castle, an Antient Family in this County. It <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon a very high Hill, over looking the County, like as Beavoit Castle over looks the Vale of that Name in Leicestershire or Harrow on the Hill overlooks Middle sex. It was formerly a very strong Place and was Refortify'd in the late Wars Sir William Beeston being in Arms at that unhappy time, but the demolish'd again.</P>
<P>From Nortwich we turn'd S. and follow∣ing the stream of the River by Middle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we cross'd the great London Road a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nantwich, or as some write it Nampw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is a fourth which is called D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oit∣wych, in Worcestershire; the nature of the thing is this, they boil the Brine into sine Salt, which is much priz'd for the Beauty of its Colour, and firmness of the Grain, but the Salt is not so strong▪ as what we now make from the Rock Salt mentioned above, and therefore loses of its Value.</P>
<P>Hence we turn'd a little West to Whit∣church, in Shropshire. But before I leave Cheshire, I must note two things of it. (1.) That there is no part of England, where there are such a great Number of Families of Gentry, and of such Ancient and Noble Extraction; Mr. Cambden is very particular in their Names, and De∣scents, but that's a Work too long for this Place, nor does it belong to my pre∣sent Design. (2.) That it is a C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Palatine, and has been so for many Ages that its Government is distinct from any other and very particular; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stred by a Chamberlain, a Judge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two Barons, of the Exchequer, three Ser∣jeants at Law, a Sheriff an Attorney an Escheator, and all proper and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subordinate Officers; and the Jurisdiction of all these Offices are kept up, and pre¦served very strictly, only we are to note that the Judge special as he is called tries only Civil Causes, the Criminal which are left to the Ordinary Judge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of England, who go the Circuits here▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in other Places.</P>
<P>Whitechurch is a pleasant and populous Town, and has a very good Church, in
<PB REF="301"/>
which is the famous Monument of the Great Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury, who, perhaps, and not unworthily, was call'd in his Time, the English <HI>Achilles.</HI> This is the Talbot so renowned in the ancient Wars in France, whom no Man in France dare to Encounter single handed, and who had Engraven on his Sword, on one side, these Words, <HI>Sum Talboti,</HI> and on the reverse. <HI>Pro vincere inimicos mees.</HI> His Epitaph is as follows:</P>

<P>But the most to be said of this Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is, that they have a good Market, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a great many Gentry near it, where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are Roman Catholicks.

<P>From hence we went towards Wales <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, and cro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s'd the Dee, at Banger∣dge: I could not satisfy myself to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> feeing this samous Town, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> once to remarkable, but was fur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when I came there▪ to see there a Stone Bridge over the Dee, and indeed, a very sine one: But as for the Town or Monastery, scarce any of the Ruins were to be seen, and as all the People spoke W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, we could find no Body that could give us any intelligence. So effectually had time in so few Years. rais'd the very Foundations of the Place, I will not say, as some do, that this is miraculous, and that it is the particular Judgment of God upon the Place, for be∣ing the Birth place of that Arch Here∣tick Pelagius, who from hence also be∣gan to broach his Heretical Opinions, which afterwards so terribly overspread the Church: I say I will not insist upon this: That Pelagius was a Monk of Bun∣gor, or Banchor, is not doubted; but for the rest I leave it where I find it.</P>
<P>This Place is now (I say) a poor contemptible Village, and has nothing to show but a fine Stone Bridge over Dee, by which we enter Deubighshire in Wales. From thence we visited Wrex∣ham, having heard much of a fine Church there, but we were greatly disappointed: There is indeed a very large Tower Steeple, if a Tower may be call'd a Steeple, and 'tis finely adorn'd with Imagery; but far from fine; the Work is mean, the sta∣tues seem all mean and in dejected Po∣stures, without any fancy or spirit in the Workmanship, and as the stone is of a reddish crumbling Kind, like the Cathe∣dral at Chester, time has made it look gross and rough.</P>
<P>There are a great many ancient Monu∣ments in this Church, and in the Church∣yard also; but none of Note, and almost all the inscrip<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious are in Welch. The Church is large; but they must be much mistaken who tell us 'tis the sinest in Eng∣land, no not among those which are as old as itself.</P>
<P>This town is large, well built and po∣pulous▪ and besides the Church there are two large Meeting ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes, in one of which we are told they preach in Welch one Part of the Day, and in English the other. Here is a great market for Welch Flan∣uel which the Factors buy up of the
<PB REF="302"/>
poor Welch People, who manufacture it; and thence it is sent to London; and it is a very considerable Manufacture indeed thro' all this Part of the Country, by which the Poor are very profitably em∣ployed.</P>
<P>From hence we turn'd South, and pas∣sing by Wem, the Title given by King Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s II. to the late Lord Chancellor Jess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es, we saw the House where his Father, then but a private Genseman lived, and in but middling Circumstances. Thence we came to F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsmere, famous for a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake or Mere, which gives the Town its Name, and which the People pretend has in some P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> no Bottom. This Place is remarkable for good Fish. From hence we came the same Night to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrewsbury.</P>
<P>This is indeed a beautiful, large prea∣sant, populous, and rich Town; full of Gentry and yet full of Tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> too; for here too, is a great Manufacture, as well of Flannel, as also of white Broadcloth, which enriches all the Country round it.</P>
<P>The Severn surrounds this Town, just as the Thames does the Isle of Dogs; so that it makes the Form of an Hor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e-shoe, over which there are two sine stone Bridges, upon one of which is built a very noble Gate, and over the Arch of the Gate the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tue of the Great Lewcllin, the Idol <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Welch, and their last Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>This is really a Town of Mirth and Galla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try, something like Bury in Sussolk, or Durham in the North▪ but much big∣ger than either of them, or indeed than both together.</P>
<P>Over the Market-house is kept a kind of Hall for the Manufactures, which are sold here weekly in very great Quantities; they speak all English in the Town, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Market Day you would think you were in Wales.</P>
<P>Here is the greatest Market, the great∣est Plenty of good Provisions, and the cheapest that is to be met with in all the Western Part of England; the Severn sup∣plies them here with excellent Salmon, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t 'tis also brou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht in great Plenty from the River Dee, which is not fat off, and which abounds with a very good Kind, and is generally larger than that in the Severn; As an Example of the Cheap∣ness of Provisions, we paid here, in a publick Inn, but a Groat a Night for Hay▪ and Six-pence a Peck for Cats for our Horses, which is cheaper than we found it in the cheapest Part of the North of England; all our other Provisions were in Proportion; and there in no do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> but the Cheapness of Provisious joined to the Pleasantness and Healthiness of the Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ draws a great many Famil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> love to live within the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> Estates.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden cails it a City: 'Tis at this Day, says he, a fine City well inha∣bited: But we do not now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it a City, yet 'tis equal to many good Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in Eng∣land, and superior to some.

<P>But they are now fully recovered, and it is at this Time one of the most flourish∣ing Towns in England; The Walls and Gates are yet standing, but useless, and the old Castle gone to Ruin, as is the Case of almost all the old Castles in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>It should not be forgotten here, that notwithstanding the Healthyness of the Place, one Blot lies upon the Town of Shrewsbury, and which, tho' nothing can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e charged on the Inhabitants, yet it seems they are the most obliged when 'tis least spoken of; namely, that here broke out first that unaccoutable Plague, called The Sweating Sickness; which at first baffled all the Sous of Art, and spread it self through the whole Kingdom of England: This happened in the Year 1551. It af∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rwards spread itself into Germany, and several Countries abroad: But I do not remember that it was ever in Spain or in Italy.</P>
<P>Here is an ancient Free School, the most considerable in this Part of England; built and endow'd by Queen Elizabeth, with a very sufficient Mam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nce for a Chief or Head Master, and three <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Ush<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.

<P>Here I was shew'd a very visible and remarkable Appearauce of the great anti∣ent Road or Way call'd Watling Street, which comes from London to this Town, and goes on from hence to the utmost Coast of Wales; where it cross'd the Se∣vern, there are Remains of a stone Bridge to be seen in the Bottom of the River, when the Water is low. On this Road we set out now for Litchfield in our Way towards London; and I would gladly have kept to this old Road, if it had been possible, because I knew several remark∣able Places stood directly upon it. But we were obliged to make many Excursi∣ons, and sometimes quit the Street for a great Way together: And first we lest it to go away South to the Edge of Stafford∣shire, to see the old House called White Ladies, and the Royal O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, the famous Retreat of King Charles <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after the Battle of Worcester. The Tree is sur∣rounded with a Palisad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to preserve i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Fate which threatned it from Curiosity; for almost every Body that came to see it for several Years, carryed away a Piece of it, so that the Tree was litterally in Danger not to dye of Age, but to be pull'd Limb from Limb; but the Veneration of that Kind is much a∣bated, and as the Palisadoes are more de∣cayed than the Tree, the latter seems likely to stand safe without them▪ as for the House, there is nothing remarkable in it; but it being a House always inhabi∣ted by Roman Catholicks, it had, and perhaps has still some Rooms so p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivate in it, that in those Times could not have been discovered without pulling down the whole Buildings.</P>
<P>Entring Stafford shire we quitted the said Street-way, a little to the left, to sce Stafford the County Town, and the most considerable except Litchsield in the Coun∣ty In the Way we were surp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>zed in a most agreeable Manner, passing thr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' a small but ancient Town called Penkrig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, vulgarly Pan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rage, where happened to be a Fair. We expected nothing extraordin∣ary; but was I say supriz'd to see the prodigious Number of Horses brought
<PB REF="304"/>
hither, and those not ordinary and com∣mon Draught-Horses, and such Kinds as we generally see at Country-Fairs re∣mote from London: But here were really incredible Numbers of the finest and most beautiful Horses that can any where be seen; being brought hither from York∣shire, the Bishoprick of Durham, and all the Horse▪Breeding Countries: We were told that there were not less than an hundred Jockies and Horse▪Kopers, as they call them there, from London, to buy Horses for sale. Also an incredible Number of Gentlemen attended with their Grooms to buy Gallopers▪ or Race-Horses, for their Newmarket sport. In a Word I believe I mark it for the greatest Horse Fair in the World▪ for Horses of Value, and especially those we call Sad∣dle-Horses There are indeed greater Fairs for Coach▪Horses, and Draught Horses; though here were great numbers of fine large Stone Horses for Coaches, &amp;c. too. But for Saddle-Horses, for the light Saddle, Hunters, Pads, and Racers, I believe the World cannot match this Fair.</P>
<P>We staid three Days here to satisfy our Curiosity, and indeed the sight was very agreeable, to see what vast stables of horses there were, which never were brought out or shewn in the Fair. How dextrous the Northern Grooms and Breeders are in their looking after them, and or∣dering them: Those Fellows take such indefatigable Pains with them, that they bring them out like Pictures of Horses, not a Hair amiss in them; they lie con∣stantly in the stables with them, and feed them by weight and measure; keep them so clean, and so sine, I mean in their Bodies, as well as their Cusides, that, in short, nothing can be more nice. Here were several Horses sold for 150 Guineas a Horses; but then they were such as were famous for the Breed, and know by their Race, almost as well as the Arabians know the Genealogy of their Horses.</P>
<P>From hence we came in two hours casy Riding to Stafford, on the River Sow; 'tis an old and indeed ancient town; and gives name to the County; but we thought to have found something more worth going so much out of the Way in it, The Town is however near and well built, and is lately much encreas'd; nay, as some say, grown rich by the Cloathing Trade, which they have fallen into but within the Reach of the present Age, and which has not enrich'd this town only, but Tamworth also, and all the Country round.</P>

<P>Near Stafford we saw Ingestre, where the late Walter Chetwynd, Esq; built or rather rebuilt a very fine church at his own charge, and where the late Lord Chet∣wynd has with a Profusion of Expence laid out the finest Park and Gardens that are in all this Part of England, and Gar∣dens that are in all this Part of England, and which, if nothing else was to be led this way, are very well worth a Travil∣ler's curiosity.</P>

<PB REF="305"/>
House is ancient; in the Park is a fa∣mous piece of Antiquity, viz. a large entrench'd camp or Fortification, surround∣ed with a double Trench, very large and deep; but the inhabitants can give no Account of it, that is worth Notice.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis about four or five Miles to Lithfield, a City, and the Prin∣cipal, next to Chester, of all the North West part of England; neither indeed is there any other, but this and Coven∣try, in the whole Road from London to Carlisle on the edge of Scotland.</P>
<P>Here we came into the great Lanca∣shire and Cheshire Road, or the North West Road from London, which passing thro' this City from Warrington Bridge in Cheshire, falls into the Watling-street Road, mention'd before, about three Miles South East from the Town, and crosses another ancient Causeway or Road, call'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ckneild-street, about a Mile out of the City; so that Litchfield lies as it were at the joining of all those great Roads.</P>
<P>Litchfield is a fine, neat, well built, and different large City; there is a little Lake or Lough of Water in the middle of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of which runs a small stream of Water, which soon becomes a little Ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulet, and save that it has but four or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve Miles to the Trent, would soon be∣come a River: This Lake parts Litch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eld, as it were, into two Cities, one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> call'd the Town, and the other the Close; in the first is the Market-place, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;ine School, and a very handsome Hos∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ital well endow'd. This Part is much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e largest and most populous: But the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther is the fairest, has the best Build∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs in, and, among the rest, the Cathe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Church, one of the finest and most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eautiful in England, especially for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utside, the Form and Figure of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilding, the carv'd work'd, Imagery, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the three beautiful Spires; the like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which are not to be seen in one Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o not in Europe.</P>
<P>There are two fine Causeways which join the City and the Close, with Slui∣ces to let the Water pass, but those were cut thro' in the Time of the late in∣testine Wars in England, and the Closs, which is wall'd about, and was then fortify'd for the King, was very strong, and stood out several vigorous Attacks against Cromwell's Men, and was not at last taken without great Loss of Blood on both sides, being gallantly defended to the last Drop, and taken by storm.</P>
<P>There are in the Close, besides the Houses of the Clergy Residentiaries, a great many very well-built Houses, and well inhabited too, which makes Litch∣sield a Place of good Conversation and good Company, above all the Towns in this County or the next, I mean War∣wickshire or Darbyshire.</P>
<P>The Description of this Church would take up much Time, and requires a very nice Observer. The See is very ancient▪ and was once Archiepiscopal, and Eadulp the Archbishop was Metropolitan of all the Kingdom of the Mercians and East Angles, but it did not hold it; then it suffer'd another Dimunition, by having the See of Chester taken away, which was once Part of this of Litchfield.</P>
<P>They told tis here a long Story of St. Chad, formerly Bishop of this Church, and how he liv'd in a little Hovel or Cell in the Church-yard, instead of a Bi∣shop's Palace: But the Bishops, since that Time, have, I suppose, thought better of it and make shift with a very fine Pa∣lace in the Closs, and the Residentiaries live in Proportion to it.</P>
<P>They have another Legendary Story also at Litehfield; namely, that a thou∣sand poor People being instructed in the Christian Faith by the care of Osfa King of the Mercians, were all martyr'd here in one Field by the Pagans, and that in the Field where they were so murder'd, King Olwy of Northumberland caused a great Church to be built; and from thence
<PB REF="306"/>
the City bears for its Device, a Landskip, or open Field, with mangled Carcasses lying dispers'd about in it, as if murder'd and left unburied: But this I take as I find it.</P>
<P>The Church I say is indeed a most beautiful Building; the West Prospect of it is charming, the two Spires on the Cor∣ner Towers being in themselves perfect Beauties of Architect, in the old Gotheic Way of Building, but made still more shining, and glorious by a third Spire, which rising from the main Tower in the Body of the Church, surmounts the other two, and shews itself exactly between them.</P>
<P>It is not casy to describe the Beauty of the West End; you enter by three large Doors in the Porch or Portico, which is as broad as the whole Front; the Spaces between the Doors are fill'd with carved Work and Imagery, no Place being void, where (by the Rules of Architect) any Ornament could be plac'd.</P>
<P>Over the first Cornish is a Row of Statues or Images of all the Kings which reign'd in Jerusalem from King David to the Captivity; but I cannot say that they are all suffic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently distinguished one from another: Above there are other Images without Number, whose Names no Ac∣count (I could meet with there) could ex∣plain.</P>
<P>The great Window <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the middle Door is very large, and the Pediment over it finely adorn'd, a large Cross finishing the Top of it; on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>her Corner of the West Front are two very fine Towers, not unlike the two Towers on the West End of St. Peter's Church at Westminster, only infinitely finer: Even with the Battlement of the Porch, and adjoining to the Towers, are large Pin∣nacles at the outer Angles, and on the Top of the Towers are to each Tower eight more, very beautiful and fine; be∣tween these Pinnacles, on the Top of each Tower, rises a Spire equal in Height, in Thickness, and in Workmanship, but so beautiful no Pen can describe them.</P>
<P>The Imagery and carv'd Work on the Front, as above, has suffered much in the late unhappy Times; and they told us the Cross over the West Window was fre∣quently shot at by the rude Soldiers; but that they could not shoot it down, which however they do not say was miracul∣ous.</P>
<P>The Inside of the Church also suffered very much, but it has been very well re∣paired since the Restoration, as well by the famous Bishop Hacket, as by the Bounty of several noble and generous Be∣nefactors.</P>
<P>The Monasticon makes Mention of a Shrine given here for the holy St. Chad, or St. Cedda, which cost 200000 l. but I conceive that to smell as much of the Legend, as the Miracles of St Chad him∣self; since such a Gift at that Time must be equal to two Millions of our Mo∣ney.</P>
<P>They tell us the main Spire of this Church is, from the Ground, 385 Foot, and the two Spires at the Angles of the West End each 260.</P>
<P>From Litchfield we came to Tamworth, a fine pleasant trading Town, eminent for good Ale and good Company, of the middling Sort; from whence we came in∣to the great Road again at Coleshill in Warwickshire.</P>
<P>This is a small but very handsome Mar∣ke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>town; it chiefly, if not wholly be∣longs to the Lord Digby, who is Lord of the Mannor, if not real Owner of almost all the Houses in the Town, and as that noble Person is at present a little on the wrong Side as to the Government, not having taken the Oaths to King George, so the whole Town are so eminently that Way too, that they told me there was but one Family of Whiggs, as they call'd them, in the whole Town, and they hop∣ed to drive them out of the Place too very quickly.</P>
<P>The late incumbent of this Parish quit∣ted his Living, which is very consider∣able, because he would not take the Oaths, and his Successor was the famous who, when I was there, was
<PB REF="307"/>
newly proscrb'd by Proclamation, and Reward of 1000 l. order'd to whoever should apprehend him; so their Instructors being such, 'tis no Wonder the People have follow'd their Leader.</P>
<P>From Coles hill we came to Coventry, the Sister City to Litchfield, and join'd in the Title of the See, which was for some little Time seated here, but afterwards re∣turned to Litchfield.</P>
<P>It was a very unhappy Time when I first came to this City; for their Heats and Animosities for Election of Members to serve in Parliament▪ were carry'd to such a Hight, that all Manner of Method being laid aside, the Inhabitants (in short) enraged at one another, met, and fought a pitched Battle in the middle of the Street, where they did not take up the breadth of the Street, as two Rabbles of People would generally do; in which Case no more could engage, but so many as the breadth of the Street would admit in the Front; but, on the contrary, the two Parties meeting in the Street, one Party kept to one side of the Way, and one side to the other, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnel in the Middle only parting them, and so march∣ing as if they intended to pass by one another, 'till the Front of one Party was come opposite to the Reer of the other, and then suddenly facing to one another, and making a long Front, where their Flanks were before, upon a Shout given, as the Signal on both Sides, they fell on with such Fury with Clubs and Staves, that in an Instant the Kinnel was cover'd with them, not with slain, but with such as were knock'd down on both Sides, and, in a Word, they fought with such Obstinacy that 'tis scarce credible.</P>
<P>Nor were these the Scum and Rabble of the Town, but in short the Burghers and chief Inhabitants, nay even Magistrates, Aldermen, and the like.</P>
<P>Nor was this one Skirmish a Decision of the Quarrel, but it held for several Weeks, and they had many such Fights; nor is the Matter much better among them to this Day, only that the Occasion does not happen so often.</P>
<P>Coventry is a large and populous City▪ and drives a very great Trade; the Ma∣nufacture of Tammies is their chief Em∣ploy, and next to that Weaving of Rib∣bons of the meanest Kind, chiefly Black. The Buildings are very old, and in some Places much decay'd; the City may be taken for the very Picture of the City of London, on the South Side of Cheapside before the great Fire; the Timber built Houses, projecting forwards and towards one another, till in the narrow Streets they were ready to touch one another at the Top.</P>
<P>The Tale of the Lady Godiva, who rode naked thro' the high Street of the City to purchase her beloved City of Co∣ventry Exemption from Taxes, is held for so certain a Truth, that they will not have it question'd upon any Account what∣ever; and the Picture of the poor Fellow that peep'd out of a Window to see her, is still kept np, looking out of a Garret in the high Street of the City: But Mr. Cambden says positively no body look'd at her at all.</P>
<P>There are eleven Churches in this City; but three of them are particular Orna∣ments to it, having fine high Spires, after the Manner of those at Litchfield, but nothing like them for the Beauty of the Building. Here is no Cathedral, as some have falsly said, neither is the great Church, so called, either Collegiate or Conven∣tual.</P>
<P>It was indeed a Monastry or Priory, and, as has been said, the Bishop's See was remov'd from Chester hither, but no Ca∣thedral was built, for the Change was not continued, and the See was soon remov'd to Litchfield, where it continues to this Day.</P>
<P>Yet this City contended a great while for it in deed, but could not carry it. In King Henry 8th's Time, the Priory be∣ing dissolv'd, the Church which they would have called a Cathedral, was reduc'd to a private Parish▪Church, and continues so to this Day; 'tis an Archdeaconry indeed, and the Bishop is stiled Bishop of Litch∣field and Coventry.</P>
<P><PB REF="308"/>
From Coventry we could by no means pass the Town of Warwick, the distance too being but about six Miles, and a very pleasant Way on the Bank of the River Avon: 'Tis famous for being the Residence of the Great Guy Earl of Warwick, known now only by Fame, which also lias said so much more than the Truth of him, that even what was true is become a kind of Ro∣mance, and the real History of his Actions is quite lost to the World.</P>
<P>That th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re was such a Man, no body (I find) makes a question, any more than they do that half of what is said of him is Fable and Fiction; but be that as it will, they show us here his Castle, his Helmet, his Sword, and tell abundance of things of him, which have some appearance of History, tho' not much Authority to sup∣port them; so I leave that Part to the cu∣rious Searchers into Antiquity, who may consult Mr Cambden, Rous, Dugdale, and other Antiquaries on that Subject who tell us the Castle was built before our Sa¦viour's Time, and has been a Place of great Consideration ever since.</P>
<P>As to the Town of Warwick, it is really a fine Town, pleasantly situated on the Bank of the Avon, over which there is a large and stately Bridge, the Avon be∣ing now grown a pretty large River, Warwick was ever esteem'd a handsome, well built Town, and there were several good Houses in it, but the Face of it is now quite alter'd; for having been almost wholly reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbish▪ by a terrible Fire about two and twenty Years ago, it is now rebuilt in so noble and so beautiful a Manner, that few Towns in England make so fine an Appearance. The new Church also is a fine Building, but all the old Monuments, which were ve∣ry many, are entirely defac'd, and lost by the Fire: However the Memory and even the Figure of 'em are eminently preserv'd by Mr. Dugdale, in his Antiquities this County, to which I refer.</P>
<P>The Castle is a fine Building, beautiful both by Situation and its Decoration; it stands on a solid Rock of Free-stone, from whose Bowels it may be said to be built, as likewise is the whole Town; the Ter∣rass of the Castle, like that of Windsor, overlooks a beautiful Country, and sees the Avon running at the Foot of the Percipice, at above 50 Foot perpendicular Hight: the Building is old, but several Times re∣pair'd and beautify'd by its several Owners, and 'tis now a very agreeable Place both within and without: the Aparments are very nicely contrived, and the Communi∣cation of the remotest Parts of the Build∣ing, one with another, are so well preserved by Galleries, and by the great Hall, which is very manificent, that one finds no Ir∣regularity in the whole Place, notwith∣standing its ancient Plan, as it was a castle not a Palace, and built for Strength rather than Pleasure.</P>
<P>The Possession of this castle is now in the Family of Grevil Lord Brook, but the Honour and Possession is separated, and has been for some Time, the ancient Fa∣mily of Beauchamp, or Bello Camdo, E. of Warwick, held it for many Ages, from whom 'tis now descended to the Earls of Holland, who are Earls of Holland and also of Warwick. But this by the Way.</P>
<P>Here we saw the antient Cell or Her∣mitage, where they say the famous Guy Earl of Warwick ended his days in a pri∣vate Retreat for his Devotion, and is from him call'd Guy Clifr, by others Gib∣clift; 'tis now, as Mr. Cambden gives an Account, which Mr. Dugdale also con∣firms, the pleasant seat of an ancient Nor∣man family of the Name of De Beau-s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, whose posterity remain there, and in se∣veral other parts of the county, retain∣ing the latter Part of their Sirname, but without the former to this Day. Mr. Dugdale gives the Monuments of them, and it appears they removed hither, on account of some Marriage, from Seyton in Rutlandshire, where they were Lords of the Mannor, and Patrons of the Church▪ and were several of the Name also still remain.</P>

Being at Warwick, I took a short cir∣cuit thro' the S. E. part of the country, resolving, after viewing a little the places of Note, that lay something out of my Intended rout, to come back to the same place.</P>
<P>Three miles from Warwick we passed over the Foss Way, which goes on to Leicester; then we came by Southam to Daventry a considerable Market Town, but which subsists chiefly by the great concourse of Travellers on the old Wat∣ling-street way, which lies near it; and the Road being turned by modern Usage, lies now thro' the Town itself, then runs on to Dunsmore Heath, where it crosses the Foss, and one branch goes on to Co∣ventry, the other joins the Foss, a d goes on to a place called High▪Cross, where it falls into the old Watling street again, and both meet again near Litch∣field</P>
<P>It is a most pleasant Curiosity to ob∣serve the course of these old famous Highways; the Ickn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld Way, the Wat∣ling street, and the Foss, in which one sees so lively a Representation of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncient British Roman and Saxon Go∣vernments, that one cannot help realliz∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng those Times to the Imagination; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' I avoid meddling with Antiquity as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch as possible in this Work, yet in his case a Circuit or Tour thro' Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and would be very imperfect, if I should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake no notice of these ways, seeing in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acing them we necessarily come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rincipal Towns, either that are or have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een in every country.</P>
<P>From Daventry we crossed the coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to Northampton, the handsomest and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built Town in all this part of Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd; but here, as at Warwick, the beau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it is owing to its own Disasters, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was so effectually and suddenly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down, that very few houses were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> standing, and this, tho' the fire began <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the day time; the flame also spread <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf with such fury, and run on with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> terrible speed, that they tell us a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wnsman being at Queen's Cross upon a Hill, on the South side of the Town, about two miles off, saw the fire at one end of the Town the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> newly begun, and that before he could get to the Town at the remorest end, opposite to that where he first saw it; 'tis now finely rebuilt with Brick and Stone, and the Streets made spacious and wide.</P>
<P>The great new Church, the Town∣hall, the Jayl, and all their publick Build∣ings, are the finest in any Country Town in England, being all new built: But he to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k very little notice of Northampton, or rather had never seen it, who told us of a Cathedral, a Chapter house and a Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yster.</P>
<P>The great Inn at the George, the Cor∣ner of the high Street, looks more like a Palace than an Inn, and cost above 2000 l. building; and so generous was the Owner, that, as we were told, when he had built it, he gave it to the Poor of the Town.</P>
<P>This is counted the Center of the Horse Markets, and Horse Fairs in Eng∣land, there being here no less then four Fairs in the Year; here they buy Horses of all So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, as well for the Saddle as for the Coach and Cart, but chiefly for the two latter.</P>
<P>Near this Town is the ancient Royal House of Holmby, which was formerly in great Esteem, and by its Situation is capable of being a Royal Palace indeed. But the melancholy Reflection of the Im∣prisonment of King Charles the First in this House and his being violently ta∣ken hence again by the mutinous Re∣bels, has a kind of Odium upon the Place, so that it has been, as it were, forsaken and uninhabited. The House and Estate has been lately purchas'd by the Dutchess of Marlborough; but we do not see that the House is like to be built or repair'd, as was at first dis∣cours'd; on the contrary it goes daily to Decay.</P>

to make some new Apartments, which, as we were told, were designed as two large Wings to the Buildings, it would have been one of the most magnificent Palaces in Europe The Gardens are exquisitely fine, and add, if it be possible to the natural Beauty of the Situation.</P>
<P>From hence we went North to Har∣bourgh, and in the Way, in the Midst of the deep dismal Roads, the dirtiest and worst in all that Part of the Country, we saw Boughton, the noble Seat of the Duke of Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tague, a House built at the Cost and by the Fancy of the late Duke▪ very much after the Model of the Palace of Versailles; the treble Wings projecting and expanded, forming a Court o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Space wider and wider, in proper Stades, an∣swerable to the Wings, the Body of the House closing the whole View.</P>
<P>The Pavillions are also after the Man∣ner of Versailles; the House itself is very large and magnificent, but the Situation facing so beautiful a Park adds to the Glory of it; the Park is wall'd round with Brick, and so finely planted with Trees, and in such au excellent Order, as I saw nothing more beautiful, no not in Italy itself, except that the Walks of Trees were not Orange and Limon, and Citron, as it is in Naples, and the Abruzzo, and other Southern Parts of Italy.</P>
<P>Here they shew'd us a petrifying Spring and told us so many Stories of its turning every Thing that was laid in it into Stone, that we began to discredit the Tale as fa∣bulous; but I have been assured, that the Water of this Spring does really petrify, and that in such a Manner as deserves the Observation of the Curious.</P>
<P>From hence we went on to Harborough intending to go forward to Leicester; but Curiosity turned us West a little to see an old Town called Lutterworth famous for being the Birth-place of honest John Wick∣lif, the first Preacher of the Reformation in England, whose Disciples were after∣wards called Lollards; when we came there we saw nothing worth Notice, nor did the People, as I could find, so much as know in general, that this great Man was born amongst them.</P>
<P>Being thus got a little out of our Way, we went on with it, and turning into the great Watling street Way, at High Cross, where the Foss crosses it, and which I sup∣pose occasioned the Name, we kept on the Street Way to Non Eaton, a manu∣facturing Town on the River Auker, and then to Atherstone, a Town famous for a great Cheese Fair on the 8th of Septem∣ber; from whence the great Cheese Fac∣tors carry the vast Quantities of Cheese they buy to Sturbridge Fair, which be∣gins about the same Time, but holds much longer; and here 'tis sould again for the Supply of the Counties of Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk.</P>
<P>From Atherston we turned N. to see Bosworth Field, famous for the great Bat∣tle which put an End to the Usurpation of Richard III. and to the long and bloody Contention between the red Rose and the White, or the Two Royal Houses of York and Lancaster, which, as Fame tells us, had cost the Lives of Eleven Princes, Three and Twenty Earls and Dukes, Three Thousand Noblemen, Knights, and Gentlemen, and Two Hun∣dred Thousand of the common People: They shew'd us the Spot of Ground where the Battle was fought, and at the Town they shewed us several Pieces of Swords, Heads of Lances, Barbs of Arrows, Pie∣ces of Pole-Axes, and such like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Death, which they said were found by the Country Peple in the sever∣al Grounds near the Place of Battle, as they had occasion to dig, or trench, or plough up the Ground.</P>
<P>Having satisfy'd our Curiosity in these Points, we turn'd East towards Leicester The E. of Stamford has a good old hunt∣ing Seat on this Side of the Country, called Bradgate, and a fine Park at Gro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣by; but they were too much ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our Way, so we came on through a fine For∣est to Leicester.</P>
<P>Leicester is an ancient large and populous Town, containing about five Parishes, 'tis

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Capital of the County of Leicester, and stands on the River Soar, which rises hot far from that High Cross I mentioned before: They have a considerable Manu∣facture carryed on here, and in several of the Market Towns round for Weaving of Stockings by Frames; and one would scarce think it possible so small an Article of Trade could employ such Multitudes of People as it does; for the whole County seems to be employed in it: As also Nottingham and Darby, of which hereafter.</P>
<P>Warwickshire and Northamtonshire are not so full of Antiquities, large Towns, and Gentlemens Seats, but this County of Leicester is as empty. The whole County seems to be taken up in Country Business, sueh as the Manufacture above, but par∣ticularly in breeding and feeding Cattle; the largest Sheep and Horses in England are found here, and hence it comes to pass too, that they are in Consequence a vast Magazine of Wool for the rest of the Nation; even most of the Gentlemen are Grasiers, and in some Places the Grasiers are so rich, that they grow Gentlemen: 'tis not an uncommon Thing for Grasiers here to rent Farms from 500 l. to Two Thousand Pounds a Year Rent.</P>
<P>The Sheep bred in this County and Lincolnshire, which joins to it, are, with∣out Comparison, the largest, and bear not only the greatest Weight of Flesh on their Bones, but also the greatest Fleeces of Wool on their Backs of any Sheep of England: Nor is the Fineness of the Wool abated for the Quantity; but as 'tis the longest Staple, (so the Clothiers call it) so 'tis the finest Wool in the whole Island, some few Places excepted, such as Lemster in H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>refordshire, the South Downs in Sussex, and such little Places, where the Quantity is small and insignificant, com∣puted to to this Part of the Country; for the Sheep breeding Country reaches from the River Anker on the Border of War∣wickshire to the Humber at the farthest End of Lincolnshire, which is near a Hun∣dred Miles in length, and from the Bank of Trent in Lincoln and Leicestershire, to the Bank of Ouse bordering Bucks, Bed∣ford, Cambridge, and Huntingdonshires, above Sixty Miles in breadth.</P>
<P>These are the Funds of Sheep which furnish the City of London with their large Mutton in so incredible a Quantity: There are indeed a few Sheep of a large Breed, which are brought up from Rum∣ney Marsh, and the adjoining low Grounds in Kent and Sussex, but they are but few, and indeed scarce worth naming, com∣pared to the vast Quantity, which are produced in these Counties.</P>
<P>The Horses produced here, or rather fed here, are the largest in England, be∣ing generally the great Black Coach Hor∣ses, and Dray Horses, of which so great a Number are continually brought up to London. that one would think so little a Spot as this of Leicestershire could not be able to supply them: Nor indeed are they all bred in this County, the adjoin∣ing Counties of Northampton and Bed∣ford having of late come into the same Business; but the chief supply is from this County, from whence the other Counties rather buy them and feed them up, as Jockeys and Chapmen, than breed them up from their beginning.</P>
<P>In the South West part of the Country rise four considerable second rate Rivers, which run every one a directly contrary Course in a most remarkable Manner.</P>
<P N="1">1 The Avon, which runs by Rugby, and goes away to Warwick; South West.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Soar, which runs by Leicester, and goes away to the Trent; North East.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Anker, which runs by Nun-Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, and goes away to Tamworth; North West.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Welland, which runs by Har∣borough, and goes away to Stamford; South West.</P>
<P>I should not pass over this just Remark of the Town, or, as Mr. Cambden calls it, City of Leicester, namely, that as it was formerly a very strong and well for∣tify'd
<PB REF="312"/>
Town, being situated to great Ad∣vantage for Strength, the River compas∣sing it half about, so it was again fortify'd in the late unhappy Wars, and being gar∣rison'd by the Parliament Forces, was assaulted by the Royalists, and being ob∣stinately defended, was taken Sword in Hand, with a great Slaughter, and not without the Loss also of several of the Inhabitants, who too rashly concern'd themselves in opposing the Conquerors. They preserve here a most remarkable Piece of Antiquity, being a Piece of Mo∣sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k work at the Botrom of a Cellar; 'tis the Story of Actaeon, and his being kill d by his own Hounds, wrought as a Pavement in a most exquisite Manner; the Stones are small, and of only two Colours, white or Brown, or Chesnut, and very small.</P>
<P>The great Henry Duke of Lancaster, and the Earl his Father lye both bury'd in this Town, in the Hospital Church, without the South gate, which Church and Hospital also the said Duke was the Founder of; but there is no Monument to be found that shews the particular Place of their Interment.</P>
<P>The Foss way leads us from hence through the Eastern and North East part of the county, and particularly through the Vale of belvoir, or, as it is common∣ly call'd, of Bever, to Newark in Not∣tinghamshire: In all this long Tract we pass a rich and fertile Country, fruitful Fields, and the noble River Trent, for twenty Miles together, often in our View; the Towns of Mount Sorrel, Loughborough, Melton Mowbray, and Waltham in the would, that is to say, on the Downs; all these are Market Towns, but o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no great Note.</P>
<P>Belvoir castle is i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deed a noble situati∣on, tho' on a very high Precipice; 'tis the antien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seat of the Dukes of Rutland, a Family risen by just Degrees to an im∣mense state both of Honour and wealth. I shall mention the House again in my Re∣turn out of Lincolnshire.</P>
<P>At Newark one can hardly see with∣out Regret the Ruins of that famous Castle, which maintain'd itself through the whole Civil War in England, and keeping a strong Garrison there for the King to the last, cut off the greatest Pass into the North that is in the whole Kingdom; nor was it ever taken, till the King, press'd by the calamity of his Af∣fairs, put himself into the hands of the Scots Army, which lay before it, and then commanded the Governor to deli∣ver it up, after which it was demolish'd, that the great Rood might lye open and free: and it remains in Rubbish to this Day. Newark is a very handsome well built Town, the Market-place a noble square, and the Church is large and spacious, with a curious Spire, which, were not Grantham so near, might pass for the finest and highest in all this Part of England: The Trent divides itself here, and makes an Island, and the Bridges lead just to the Foot of the Ca∣stle Wall; so that while this Place was in the Hands of any Party, there was no Travelling but by their leave: But all the Travelling into the North at that Time was by Nottingham Bridge, of which by itself.</P>
<P>From Newark, still keeping the Foss Way, which lies as strait as a Line can mark it out, we went on to Lincol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ha∣ving a View of the great Church call'd the Minster all the way before us, the River Trent on the Left, and the Downs call'd Lincoln Heath on the Right.</P>
<P>Lincoln is an ancient, ragged, d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cay'd, and still decaying City; it is so full of of the Ruins of Monasteries and religi∣ous Houses, that, in short, the very Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Stables, Out-houses, and, as they shew'd me, some of the very Hog styes, were built Church Fashion; that is to say, with Stone Walls and arch'd Windows ond Doors. There are here thirteen Churches, but the meanest to look on that are any where to be seen, the cathe∣dral indeed and the Ruins of the old ca∣stle are very venerable Pieces of Antiqui∣ty.</P>
<P>The situation of the City is very par∣ticular; one Part is on the flat and in a
<PB REF="313"/>
Bottom, so that the Wittham, a little River that runs through the Town, flows sometimes into the street, the other Part lies upon the Top of a high Hill, where the Cathedral stands, and the very steepest Part of the Ascent of the Hill is the best Part of the City for Trade and Business,</P>
<P>Nothing is more troublesome than the communication of the upper and lower Town, the street is so steep and so strait, the Coaches and Horses are oblig'd to fetch a compass another way, as well one hand as on the other.</P>
<P>The River Wittham, which as I said runs thro' the City, is arch'd over, so that you see nothing of it as you go thro' the main street; but it makes a large Lake on the West side, and has a Canal, by which it has a communication with the Trent, by which means the Navi∣gation of the Trent is made useful for Trade to the City; this Canal is called the Foss dike.</P>
<P>There are some very good Buildings, and a great deal of very good company, in the upper City, and several Families of Gentlemen have Houses there, besides those of the Prebendaries and other Clergy belonging to the Cathedral.</P>
<P>This Cathedral is in itself a very noble structure, and is counted very fine, though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thought it not equal to some that I have already describ'd, particularly not to that at Litchfield: Its situation indeed is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfinitely more to Advantage, than any Cathedral in England, for it is seen far <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd wide; it stands upon an exceeding high Hill, and is seen into 5 or 6 Counties.</P>
<P>The Building in general is very noble, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the Church itself is very large; it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as a double Cross, one in the Nave or Center on which the great Tower stands, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd one at the East End of the Choir, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder which are several ancient Monu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; the length of the Church is near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo Foot, the Breadth 126; so that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch larger than that at Litchfield; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o spires on the Towers at the Angles <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the West End are mean, small, and low, and not to be nam'd with those at Litchfield: The Tower also is very plain and has only four very ill-proportion'd Spires, or rather Pinnacles, at the four corners small and very mean.</P>
<P>As the Church is very large, so the Revenue of the Bishoprick is large also, and was formerly immensely great, as may be seen by the Monasticon, where there is an astonishing Account of the wealth of the Place.</P>
<P>The Church, as it is the seat of the Bishoprick, is not ancient, the See being remov'd, since the Norman conquest, from Dorchester, a little Town in Ox∣fordshire, on the River Thames, not far from Tame, of which I have spoken in its Place; but the City is ancient, and the Ruins of it tell us as much; it was certainly a flourishing City in the time of the Romans, and continued so after the fall of their Empire.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden says King Vortimer, that valiant Britain, died here, and was bury'd in the Church of the great Mona∣stery; but we see nothing of his Re∣mains in the Cathedral, for that was not built till several Ages after.</P>
<P>The City was a large and flourishing Place at the time of the Norman con∣quest, tho' neither the castle or the great church were then built; there were then three and fifty Parish churches in it, of which I think only thirteen remain; the chief Extent of the city then was from the Foot of the Hill South, and from the Lake or Lough which is call'd Swan∣pool East; and by the Domesday Book they tell us it must be one of the greatest Cities in England, whence perhaps that old English Proverbal Dine:</P>
<P><HI>Lincoln</HI> was, <HI>London</HI> is, and <HI>York</HI> shall be.</P>
<P>It is certain William the Conqueror built the Castle, and, as 'tis said, to curb the po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent Citizens; and the Ruins shew that it was a most magnificent work, well fortify'd, and capable of receiving of a nu∣merous Garrison.</P>
<P><PB REF="314"/>
The Bishoprick of Lincoln at that Time contain d all that now is contain'd in the Diocesses of Ely, Peterborough, and Ox∣ford, besides, what is now the Diocess of Lincoln; And 'tis still the largest Dio∣cess, tho' not of the greatest Revenue, in England; containing the several Counties of Lincoln, Leicester, Huntingdon, Bed∣ford, Bucks, and Part of Hertford; and in them 1255 Parishes, whereof 577 are Impropriations; and there are in this Bounds six Archdeacons, viz. Lincoln, Leicester, Bedford, Buckingham, Stow, and Huntington. This See, tho' of no longer Date than since the Conquest has produced to the Church and State.</P>

<P>He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was the famous Battle fought be∣tween the Friend of the Empress Maud, Mother to Henry II. and King Stephen, in which that magnanimous Prince was overthrown and taken Prisoner.</P>
<P>But all this relates to Times past, and is an Excursion, which I shall attone for by making no more. Such is the present State of Lincoln, that it is an old dying, decay'd, dirty City; and except that Part, which, as above, lies between the Castle and the Church, on the Top of the Hill, it is scarce tolerable to call it a City.</P>
<P>Yet it stands in a most rich, pleasant, and agreeable Country; for on the North, and again on the South East, the noble Plain, call'd Lincoln Heath, extends it∣self, like the Plains about Salisbury, for above fifty Miles; namely, from Sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ford and Ancaster South to the Bank of the Humber North, tho' not with a Breadth equal to the vast stretch'd out Length; for the Plain is hardly any where above three or four Miles broad.</P>
<P>On the West Side of this Plain, the Trent Waters a pleasant and rich Valley, running from Newark to Gainsborough, a Town of good Trade, as well foreign as home Trade, thence to Burton, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the Humber.</P>
<P>As the Middle of the Country is all hilly, and the West Side low, so the East Side is the richest, most fruitful, and best cultivated of any County in England, so far from London; one Part is all Fen or Marsh Grounds, and extends itself South to the Isle of Ely, and here it is that so vast a Quantity of Sheep are fed, as makes this County and that of Leicester an in∣exhaustible Fountain of Wool for all the manufacturing Counties in England.</P>
<P>There are abundance of very good Towns too in this Part, especially on the Sea Coast, as Grimsby, in the utmost point of the County North East, facing the Humber and the Ocean, and almost op∣posite to Hull: A lit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le farther within Humber is Barton, a Town noted for no∣thing that I know of but an ill-favoured dangerous Passage, or Ferry, over the Humber to Hull; where in an open Boat, in which we had about fifteen Horses, and ten or twelve Cows, mingled with about seventeen or eighteen P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssengers, call'd Christians; we were about four Hours toss'd about on the Humber, be∣fore we could get into the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bour at Hull; whether I was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sick or not, is not worth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that we were all sick of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> one may suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I was so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by York, rather than return <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, at least for that Time.</P>
<P>Grimsby is a good Town, but I think <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but an indifferent Road for Shipping; and in the great Storm, (A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. 170<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) it was proved to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> almost all the Ships that lay in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> by Road were driven from their Anchors, and many of them lost.</P>

and Boston: As these are all, except the last, Inland Towns, they afford little re∣markable, only to intimate that all this Country is employ'd in Husbandry, in Breeding and Feeding innumerable Droves and Flocks of black Cattle and Sheep: Indeed I should not have said black Cat∣tle, I should have call'd them red Cattle; for it was remarkable, that almost all their Cows for 50 Miles together are red or Py'd red and white, and consequently all the Cattle raised there, are the same; what they feed which are brought from other Counties, (for the Fens feed infinite Numbers which they buy from other Places;) that (I say) is another Case.</P>
<P>The Fen Country begins about Wain∣sle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, which is within twenty Miles of Grimsby, and extends i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the isle of Ely South, and to the Grounds opposite to Lynn Regis in Norfolk East.</P>

<P>The Town of Boston is a large, po∣pulous, and well built Town, full of good Merchants, and has a good Share of fo∣reign Trade, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lynn.

<P>These Fens are indeed very considerable for their Extent▪ for they reach in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in some Places fifty Miles, and in Breadth above thirty: And as they are so level that there is no Interruption to the sight, any Building of extraordinary hight is seen a long Way, for Example, Boston Steeple is seen upon Lincoln Heath near thirty Miles, Peterborough and Ely Minsters are seen almost throughout the whole Level, so are the Spires of Lynn, Whittle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, and Crowland▪ seen at a very great Dist∣ance, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Beauty to the Coun∣try.</P>
<P>From Boston we came on through the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Country to Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling, which is ano∣ther Sea Port in the Level, but standing far within the Land on the River Wel∣land. Here was nothing very remarkable
<PB REF="316"/>
to be seen as to Antiquity, but the Ru∣ins of an old famous Monastry, of which the Monasticon gives a particular De∣scription. There is a Bridge over the Welland, and Vessels of about fifty or sixty Ton may come up to the Town, and that is sufficient for the Trade of Spalding, which is chiefly in Corn and Coal.</P>
<P>We must not pass by Crowland, an∣o her Place of great religious Antiquity, her being once a famous Monastery, the Remains of which are still to be seen: The Monks of Crowland were eminent in History, and a great many Stories are told of the Devils of Crowland al∣so, and what Conversation they had with the Monks, which Tales are more out of Date, than they were formerly; for they tell us, that in ancient Times those Things were as certainly believ'd for Truths, as if they had been before their Faces.</P>
<P>There is one Thing here that is cu∣rious indeed, and very remarkable, and which is not to be seen in any other Place in Britain, if it be in Europe; namely, a triangular Bridge: The Case is this: The River Welland and another River, or rather a Branch from the River Nyne, joining together just at Crowland, and the Bridge being fixed at the very Point where they join, stands upon a Center in the middle of the united Waters, and then parting into two Bridges, lands you one to the Right upon Thornsby, and one to the Lest upon Holland; and yet they tell us there is a Whirpool, or bottomless Pit, in the Middle too; but that Part I see no reason to give Credit to.</P>
<P>The Town of Spalding is not large, but pretty well built and well inhabited; but for the Healthyness or Pleasantness of it, I have no more to say than this, that I was very glad when I got out of it, and out of the rest of the Fen Country; for 'tis a horrid Air for a Stranger to breathe in.</P>
<P>The History of the Draining those Fens, by a set of Gentlemen call'd the Adventurers, the several Laws for secur∣ing and preserving the Banks, and divid∣ing the Lands; how they were by the extraordinary Conflux of Waters from all the Inland Counties of England fre∣quently overflow'd, and sometimes lay under Water most Part of the Year; how all the Water in this Part of England, which does not run into the Thames, the Trent, or the Severn, falls together into these low Grounds, and empty themselves into the Sea by those Drains, as thro' a Sink; and how by the Skill of these Adventurers, and, at a prodigious Ex∣pence, they have cut new Channels, and even whole Rivers, with particular Drains from one River to another, to carry off the great Flux of Waters, when Floods or Freshes came down either on one side or on the other; and how notwithstand∣ing all that Hands could do, or Art con∣trive, yet sometimes the Waters do still prevail, the Banks break, and whole Le∣vels are overflow'd together; all this, tho' it would be very useful and agreeable to have it fully and Geographically describ'd, yet it would take up so much Room, and be so tedious here, where you are expect∣ing a summary Description of Things, rather than the History and Reasons of them, that I cannot think of entering any farther into it.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that these Fens of Lincolnshire are of the same Kind with, and contiguous to those already mentioned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Ely, in the Counties of Cambridge and Huntington, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here, as well as there, we see innumer∣able Numbers of Cattle, which are fed up to an extraordinary Size by the Richness of the Soil.</P>
<P>Here are also an infinite Number o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wild Fowl, such as Duck and Maliard Teal and Widgeon, Brand Geese, wild Geese, &amp;c. and for the taking of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first Kinds, here are a great Number o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Decoys or Duckoys, call them which yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> please, from all which the vast Numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Fowls they take are sent up to London the Quantity indeed is incredible, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="317"/>
Accounts which the Country People give of the Numbers they sometimes take, are such, that one scarce dare re∣port it from them. But this I can say, of my certain Knowledge, that some of these Decoys are of so great an Extent, and take such great Quantities of Fowl, that they are let for great sums of money by the Year, viz. from 100 <HI>l.</HI> to 3, 4, and 500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year Rent.</P>
<P>The Art of taking the Fowls▪ and especially of Breeding up a Set of Crea∣tures. call'd Decoy Ducks, to entice and then betray their Fellow Ducks into the several Decoys, is very admirable indeed, and deserves a Description; tho' 'tis not very easy to describe it, take it in as few as I can.</P>
<P>The Decoy Ducks are first naturalized to the Place, for they are hatch'd and bred up in the Decoy Ponds: There are in the Ponds certain Places where they are constantly fed▪ and where being made tame, they are used to come even to the Decoy Man's Hand for their Food.</P>
<P>When they fly abroad, or, as might be said, are sent abroad, they go none knows where; but 'tis believ'd by some they fly quite over the Seas into Hol∣land and Germany; there they meet with others of their Acquaintance▪ that is to say, of their own Kind, where sorting with them, and observing how poorly they live, how all the Rivers are frozen up, and the Lands cover'd with Snow, and that they are almost starv'd, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail not to let them know, (in Language that they make one understand) that in England, from whence they came, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is quite alter'd; that the English Ducks live much better than they do in those cold Climates; that they have open Lakes, and Sea Shores full of Food, the Tides flowing freely into every Creek; that they have also within the Land, large Lakes, refreshing Springs of Water, open Ponds, covered and secured from human Eyes, with large Rows of grown Trees and impenetrable Groves; that the Lands are full of Food, the Stubbles yielding constant supplies of Corn, left by the negligent Husbandmen, as it were on purpose for their Use, that 'tis not once in a wild Duck's Age, that they have any long Frosts or deep Snows, and that when they have, yet the Sea is ne∣ver frozen, or the Shores void of Food; and that if they will please but to go with them into England; they shall share with them in all these good Things.</P>
<P>By these Representations, made in their own Duck Language, (or by whatever other Arts which we know not) they draw together a vast Number of the Fowls, and, in a Word, Kidnap them from their own Country; for being once brought out of their Knowledge, they follow the Decoys, as a Dog follows the Huntsman▪ and 'tis frequent to see these subtle Crea∣tures return with a vast Flight of Fowls with them, or at their Heels, as we may say, after the said Decoy Ducks have been absent several Weeks together.</P>
<P>When they have brought them over, the first Thing they do is to settle with them in the Decoy Ponds, to which they (the Decoy Ducks) belong: Here they chatter and gabble to them, in their own Language, as if they were telling them, that these are the Ponds they told them of, and here they should soon see how well they should live, how secure and how safe a Retreat they had here.</P>
<P>When the Decoy men perceive they are come, and that they are gathering and encreasing, they fail not to go se∣cretly to the Pond's side, I say secretly, and under the Cover which they have made with Reeds, so that they cannot be seen, where they throw over the Reeds Handfuls of Corn, in shallow Pla∣ces, such were the Decoy Ducks are u∣sually fed▪ and where they are sure to come for it, and to bring their new Guests with them for their Entertainment.</P>
<P>This they do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or two or three Days to∣gether, and no harm follows, 'till throw∣ing in this Bait one Time in an open wide
<PB REF="318"/>
Place▪ another Time in another open wide Place, the third Time it is thrown in a narrower Place; that is to say, where the Trees▪ which hung over the Water and the Banks, stand nearer, and then in another yet narrower, where the said Trees are over head like an Arbour, tho' at a good Hight from the Water.</P>
<P>Here the Boughs are so artfully manag∣ed, that a large Net is spread near the Tops of the Trees among the Branches▪ and fasten'd to Hoops which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Side to Side: This is so high and so wide, and the Room is so much below, and the Water so open▪ that the Fowls do not perceive the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t above them at all.</P>
<P>Here the Decoy man keeping unseen, behind the Hedges of Reeds, which are made perfectly close, goes forward, throw∣ing Corn over the Reeds into the Water; the Decoy Ducks greedily fall upon it, and calling the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> foreign Guests, seem to tell them, that now they may find their Words good and how well the Ducks live in England; so inviting or rather wheedling them forward, 'till by Degrees they are all gotten under the Arch or Sweep of the Net, which is on the Trees, and which by Degrees, imperceptibly to them▪ declines lower and lower, and al∣so narrower and narrower, 'till at the far∣ther End it comes to a Point like a Purse; though this farther End is quite out of Sight, and perhaps two or three hundred Yards from the first Entrance.</P>
<P>When the whole Quantity are thus greedily following the Leading Ducks or Decoys, and feeding plentifully as they go; and the Decoy man sees they are all within the Arch of the Net and so far with∣in as not to be able to escape, on a sudden a Dog, which 'till then he keeps close by him, and who is perfectly taught his Busi∣ness. rushes from behind the Reeds, and jumps into the Water, swimming directly after the Ducks, and (terribly to them) Barking as he swims.</P>
<P>Immediately the Ducks (frighted to the last Degree) rise upon the Wing to make their Escape, but to their great Surprize, are beaten down again by the arched Net, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver their Heads: Being then forced into the Water, they necessarily swim forward, for fear of that terrible Creature the Dog; and thus they crowd on, 'till by Degrees the Net growing lower and narrower, as is said, they are hurried to the very farther End, where another Decoy-man stands ready to receive them, and who takes them out alive with his Hands.</P>
<P>As for the Traytors, that drew the poor Ducks into this Snare, they are taught to rise but a little Way, and to not reaching to the Net, they fly back to the Ponds, and make their Escape; or else, being used to the Decoy-man, they go to him fearless, and are taken out as the rest; but instead of being kill'd with them, are strok'd, made much of, and put into a little Pond just by him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and made much of for their Services.</P>
<P>There are many Particulars in the man∣aging and draining these Levels, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w∣ing off the Water by Mills and Engines, and cultivating the Grounds in an unusual Man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, which would be very useful to be describ'd; but the needful Brevity of this Work will not admit of it: yet some∣thing may be touch'd at.</P>
<P N="1">1. That here are some wonderful En∣gines for throwing up Water, and such as are not to be se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any where else, whereof one in particular throw up, (as they assured us) twelve hun∣dred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of Water in half an Hour, and goes by Wind Sail<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 12 Wings or Soils to a Mill: This I saw the Model of, but I must own I did not see it perform.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here are the greatest Improvements by planting of Hemp, that, I think, is to be seen in England; particular∣ly on the Norfolk and Cambridge S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of the Fens, as about Wisbech, Well, and several other Places, where we saw many hundred Acres of Ground bearing great Crops of Hemp.</P>
<P N="3">3 Here is a particular Trade carry'd on with London, which is no where
<PB REF="319"/>
else practised in the whole Kingdom, that I have met with, or heard of, (viz.) For carrying Fish alive by Land Carriage; this they do by car∣rying great Buts fill'd with Water in Waggons as the Carriers draw other Goods: The Buts have a little square Flap, instead of a Bung, about ten, twelve, or fourteen Inches square, which, being open'd, gives Air to the Fish, and every Night, when they come to the Inn, they draw off the Water, and let more fresh and sweet Water run into them again. In these Carriages they chiefly carry Tench and Pike, Pea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch and Eels, but espe∣cially Tench and Pike, of which here are some of the largest in England.</P>
<P>Whittlesea and Ramsey Meres are two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes, made by the River Nyne or Nene, which runs through them; the first is be∣tween five and six Mile long, and three or four Miles broad, and is indeed full of excellent Fish for this Trade.</P>
<P>From the Fenns, longing to be deliver∣ed from Fogs and stagnate Air, and the Water of the Colour of brew'd Ale, like the Rivers of the Peak, we first set Foot <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n dry Land, as I call'd it, at Peterbor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh.</P>

<P>In this Church was bury'd the Body of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e unhappy Mary Queen of Scots, Mo∣ther to King James the First, who was be∣headed not far off in Fotheringay Castle in the same County, but her Body was afterwards removed by King James the First, her Son, into Westminster Abbey, where a Monument is erected for her, in King Henry the VIIth's Chappel; tho' so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e do not s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ick to tell us, that tho' the Monument was erected, the Body was never remov'd.</P>
<P>Here also lies interred another unhappy Queen, namely, the Lady Katharine of Spain, the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vorc'd Wise of King Henry VIII. and Mother to Queen Mary: who reigned immediately after King Edward VI. Her Monument is not very magni∣ficent, but 'tis far from mean. Here is an old decay'd Monument of Biship Wulser, the Founder of the Church; but this Church has so often been burnt and de∣molished, since that Time, that 'tis doubt∣ful when they shew it you, whether it be authentick o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</P>
<P>The Chappel here, call'd St. Mary's, is a very curious Building, tho' now not in use the Choir has been often repair'd g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d beautify'd, and is now very fine; but the West End, or great Gate, is a Prodi∣gy for its Beauty and Variety. 'Tis re∣markable, that as this Church, when a Monastry, was famous for its great Re∣venues, so now, as reduced, 'tis one of the poorest Bishopricks in England, if not the meanest.</P>
<P>Coming to this little City landed us in Northamptonshire; but as great Part of Lincolnshire, which is a vastly extended large County, remain'd yet uns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> we were obliged to turn North from Peterbo∣rough, and take a View of the Fens again, though we kept them at some Distance too Here we pass'd the Welland at Market Deeping, an old, ill built and dirty Town; then we went through Bourn to Folkingham, near which we say two Pieces of decay'd Magnificence; one was the old d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lished Monastry of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣pringham, the Seat of the Gilbertine Nuns, so famous for Austerity, and the severest Rules, that any other religious Order have yielded to, and the other was the antient

House of the Lord Clinton. Queen Eli∣zabeth's Admiral, where that great and noble Person once liv'd in the utmost Splendor and Magnificence; the House, tho' in its full decay, shows what it has been, and the Plaister of the Clelings and Walls in some Rooms is so fine, so f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, and so entire, that they break it off in large Flakes, and it will bear Writing on it with a Pencil or Steel Pen, like the Leaves of a Table Book. This sort of Plaister I have not seen any where so very fine, except in the Palace of None∣such in Surrey near Epsom, before it was demolish'd by the Lord Berkeley.</P>
<P>From hence we cross'd Part of the great Heath mentioned before, and came into the high Road again at Ancaster, a small but ancient Roman Village, and full of Remnants of Antiquity: This Town gives now the Title of Duke to the an∣cient Family of Lindsey, now Dukes of Ancaster, formerly only Earls of Lind¦sey, and hereditary Lords Chamberlains of England.</P>
<P>This Place and Panton, a Village near it, would afford great Subject of Dis∣course, if Antiquity was my present Pro∣vince, for here are found abundance of Roman Coins, Urns, and other Remains of Antiquity, as also in several Parts here∣about; and Mr. Cambden puts it out of Doubt, that at this Town of Ancaster there was a Station or Colony settled of Ro∣mans, which afterwards swell'd up into a City, but is now sunk again out of Know∣ledge</P>
<P>From hence we came to Grantham, famous for a very fine Church and a Spire Steeple so sinely built, and so very high, that I do not know many higher and finer built in Britain. The vulgar Opinion, that this Steeple stands leaning, is certainly a vulgar Error: I had no Instrument indeed to judge it by, but, according to the stric∣rest Observation, I could not perceive it, or any thing like it, and am much of O∣pinion with that excellent Poet:</P>
<P>'Tis Hight makes <HI>Grantham</HI> Steeple stand awry.</P>
<P>This is a neat, pleasant, well-built and populous Town, has a good Market, and the Inhabitants are said to have a very good Trade, and are generally rich There is also a very good Free School here. This Town lying on the great Northern Road is famous, as well as Stain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, for abundance of very good Inns, some of them fit to entertain Persons of the greatest Quality and their Retinues, and it is a great Advantage to the Place.</P>
<P>From a Hill, about a Mile beyond this Town North West, being on the great York Road, we had a Prospect again into the Vale of Bever, or Belvoir, which I mentioned before; and which spreads itself here into three Countries, to wit, Lincoln, Leicester, and Rutlandshires: Also here we had a distant View of Be∣ver, or Bellevoir Castle, which 'tis sup∣posed took its Name from the Situation, from whence there is so fine a Prospect, of Bellevoir over the Country; so that you see from the Hill into six Countries, namely, into Lincoln, Nottingham, Dat by, Leicester, Rutland, and Northamp∣ton Shires. The Castle or Palace (for such it now is) of Bevoir, is now the Seat of the Noble Family of Manners▪ Dukes of Rutland, who have also a very noble Estate, equal to the Demesnes of some Sovereign Princes, and extending itself into Nottingham and Datby<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are far and wide, and in which Estate they have an immense subterranean Treasure, never to be exhausted; I mean the Lead Mines and Coal-Pits, of which I shall by more in its Place.</P>
<P>Turning Southward from hence we enter'd Rutlandshire, remarkable for be∣ing the least County in England, having but two Market Towns in it, viz. Oke∣ham and U<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pingham, but famous for∣abundance of fine Seats of the Gentle∣men, and some of the first Rank; as par∣ticularly the Earls of Gains borough and

Nottingham; the latter has at a very great Expence, and some Years Labour, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebuilt the ancient Seat of Burleigh on the Hill, near Okeham, and on the edge of the Vale of Cathross. This House would indeed require a Volume of itself, to describe the pleasant situation, and magnificent Structure, the finest Gardens, the perfectly will▪finish'd Apartments, the curious Paintings, and well-stor'd Li∣brary: All these merit a particular View, and consequently an exact Description; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it is not the Work of a few Pages, and it would be to lessen the Fame of this Palace, to say any thing by way of Ab∣stract where every Part calls for a full Account: At present, all I can say of it is, there may be some extraordinary Palaces in England, where there are so many fine ones, I say there may be some that excell in this or that Particular, but I do not a House in Britain, which excels all the rest in so many Particulars, or that goes so near to excelling them all in every thing. Take something of it in the following Lines, Part of a Poem, written wholly upon the Subject, by an anonymous Author.</P>

<P>From hence we came to Stamford; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Town is placed in a Kind of an An∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the County of Lincoln, just upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Edge of three Counties, viz. Lincoln, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rthampton, and Rutland: This Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asts greatly too of its Antiquity, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deed it has evident Marks of its ha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng been a very great Place in former <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys.</P>
<P>History tells us it was burnt by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes above 1500 Years ago, being then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urishing City: Tradition tells us, it was once a University, and that the Schools were first erected by Bladud King of the Britains; the same whose Figure stands up at the King's Bath in the City of Bath, and who liv'd 300 Years before our Saviour's Time: But the famous Camps and military Ways, which still appear at and near this Town, are a more visible Testimony of its having been a very an∣cient Town, end that it was consider∣able in the Romans Time.</P>
<P><PB REF="322"/>
It is at this Time a very fair, well∣built, considerable and wealthy Town, consisting of six Parishes, including that of St. Martin in Stamford Baron; that is to say, in that Part of the Town which stands over the River, which, tho' it is not a Part, of the Town, critically speak∣ing, being not in the Liberty, and in ano∣ther County, yet 'tis called Stamford, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated with it in the Taxes, and the like.</P>
<P>This Town is the Property, as it may be called, of the Earles of Excester; for the Author of the Survey of Stamford, Page 15 says, William, Cecil, Baron Bur∣leigh, and afterwards Earl of Excester, obtained the Fee Farm of Queen Eliza∣beth for himself, in whose Posterity it yet remains.</P>
<P>The Government of this Town is not, it seems, as most Towns of such Note are, by a Mayor and Aldermen, but by an Alderman, who is chief Magistrate, and twelve Comburgesses, and twenty four capitual Burgesses, which, abating their Worships Titles, is, to me, much the same Thing as a Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council.</P>
<P>They boast in this Town of very great Privileges, especially to their Alderman, who is their chief Magistrate, and his Comburgesses; such as being freed from the Sheriffs Jurisdiction, and from being empannel'p on Juries out of the Town; to have the Return of all Writs, to be freed from all Lords Lieutenants and from their Musters, and for having the Militia of the Town commanded by their own Officers, the Alderman being the King's Lord Lieutenant, and immediately under his Majesty's Command, and to be (within the Liberties and Jurisdiction of the Town) esteemed the second Man in the Kingdom; and the Grant of those Privilieges concludes thus; Ut ab antiquo usu fuerunt, as of antient Time they had been accustomed: So that this Charter, which was granted by Edward IV. Ann. 1461. seems to be only a Confirmation of former Privileges, not a Grant of new ones.</P>

<P>There is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River Welland of five Arches, and the Town-Hall is in the upper Part of the Gate, upon or at the End of the Bridge, which is a very handsome Building. There are two constant Weekly Markets here, viz. on Mondays and Fridays, but the last is the chief Market▪ They have also three Fairs, viz. St. Simon and Jude, St James's, and Green▪goose Fair, and a great Midlent Mart; but the latter is not now so considerable, as it is reported to have formerly been.</P>

<P>This House, built all of Free stone, looks more like a Town than a House, at which Avenue soever you come to it; the Towers and the Pinnacles so high, and placed at such a Distance from one another, look like so many distant Parish-Churches in a great Town, and a large

Spire covered with Lead, over the great Cloek in the Center, looks like the Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hedral, or chief Church of the Town.</P>
<P>The House stands on an Eminence, which rises from the North Entrance of the Park, coming from Stamford: On <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he other Side, viz.

<P>As this admirable Genius, the late Earl, lov'd paintings, so he had infinite Advan∣tage in procuring them; for he not only travil'd three times into Italy, and stay d every time a considerable while at Flor∣ence, but he was so entertain'd at the Court of Tulcany, and had, by his most Prince∣ly Deportment and excellent Accomplish∣ments, so for obtain'd upon the Great Duke, that he might be said indeed to love him, and his Highness snew'd the Earl ma∣ny ways that Esteem▪ and more particu∣larly, in assisting him to purchase many ex∣cellent Pieces at reasonable Prices; and not only so, but his Highness presented him with several Pieces of great Value.</P>
<P>Among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est, there is, in the great Hall, his Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p's Picture, on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> done by the G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea: Duke's principal painter, at his Highness's charge▪ and given to his Lordship, as a Mark of the Great Duke's special Favour: There is also a fine Piece of Seneca bleeding to Death in the warm Bath, and Dictating his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> morals to his Scholars; the Passions are in so lively a Manner described in the Scholars, their cager Attention, their generous Regard to their Manner, their vigilant Catching at his Words, and some of them taking Minutes, that it is indeed admirable and inexpressible. I have been told, that the King of France offer'd the Earl 6000 Pistoles for it.</P>
<P>It would be endless to give a Detail of the fine pieces his Lordship brought from Italy, all Originals, and by the best ma∣sters; 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to say, they infinitely exceed all that can be seen in England, and are of more Value <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han the house itself, and all the park belonging to it.</P>

<P>Besides the Pictures, which, as above, were brought from Abroad, the House itself, at least the hew Apartments may be said to be one entire Picture. The Stair Case, the Ceilings of all the fine Lodgings, the Chapel, the Hall, the late Earl's Closet, are all finely painted by VARRIO, of whose Work I need say no more than this, that the Earl kept him twelve Years in his Family, wholly em∣ploy'd in Painting those Cielings and Stair Cases. &amp;c. and allow'd him a Coach and Horses, and Equipage▪ a Table, and Servants and a very considerable Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on.</P>
<P>N. B. "The Character this Gentleman <Q>“”left behind him at this Town, is, that he deferv'd it all for his Paint∣ings; but for nothing else; his scan∣dalous Life, and his unpaid Debts, it seems, causing him to be but very meanly spoken of in the Town of Stamford.</Q></P>
<P>I might dwell a long while upon this Subject, and could do it with great Plea∣sure, Burleigh House being well worth a full and compleat Description; but this Work will not admit of Enlargements.</P>
<P>By the Park Wall, or, as some think, through the Park, adjoining to Burleigh House, pass'd an old Roman Highway, beginning at Castor, a little Village near Peterborough; but which was anciently a Roman Station, or Colony, call'd Du∣robrevum; this way is still to be seen, and is now call'd The 40 Foot Way, passing from Gunworth Ferry (and Pe∣terborough) to Stamford: This was, as the Antiquaries are of Opinion, the Great Road into the North, which is since turn'd from Stilton in Huntingdonshire to Wandsworth or Wandsword, where there is a very good Bridge over the Ri∣ver Nyne; which coming down from Northampton, as I have observ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passes thence by Peterbo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the Fen Country: But if I may straggle a little into Antiquity, (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have studiously avoided) I am of O¦pinion, neither this or Wansford <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ancient Northern Road in use by the Romans; for 'tis evident, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Roman Causway is still seen on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> left Hand of that Road, and passing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nyne at a Place call'd Water <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> went directly to Stamford, and pass'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Welland, just above that Town, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Place where the Bridge stands <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and this Roman way is still to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both on the South and the North <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Welland, stretching itself on to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Casterton, a little Town upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Guash, about three Miles beyond <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which was, as all Writers agree▪ another Roman Station, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Guasennae by the Antients, from when<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the River is supposed also to take <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Name; whence it went on to Panton▪ another very considerable Colony, and so to Newark, where it cross'd the Foss.</P>
<P>This Forty Foot Way then must be a cross Road from Castor, and by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the Fen Country, so leading into the great Highway at Stamford; as like∣wise another Cross Road went out of the said Great Road at Panton, above named, to Ancaster, where was a Roman Cohort plac'd, and thence join'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again at Lincoln.</P>
<P>Near this liitle Village of Castor lives the Lord Fitz Williams, of an ancient Family, tho' an Irish Title, and his Lord∣ship has lately built a very fine Stone Bridge over the River Nyne, near Gun∣worth, where formerly was the Ferry</P>
<P>I was very much applauding this ge∣nerous Action of my Lord's, knowing the Inconvenience of the Passage there before, especially if the Waters of the Nyne were but a little swelled, and I thought it a piece of Publick Charity▪ but my Applause was much abated, when coming to pass the Bridge (being in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

On the other side of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er is a fine new built House, all of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possess'd by Sir Francis St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bart. which affords a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to Travellers, as they pass <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hill beyond Stilton to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bridge. This Wansford has obtain'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Addition to its Name, from a Story <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believed by the Country People, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they will hardly allow any room for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction; namely, That a great Flood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hastily down the River Nyne, Haymaking-time, a Country Fellow, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken up his Lodging on a Cock lay in the Meadow, was driven down Stream in the Night, while he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sleep; and the Hay swimming, and the Fellow sleeping▪ they drove together towards <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens, whence he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly going on to the Sea; when be∣ing wakened, he was seen and taken up by some Fishermen, almost in the open Sea; and being ask'd, who he was? he told them his N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and where he lived? He answer'd, at Wansford in England: From this Story the Town is called Wans∣f rd in England; and we see at the Great In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by the South End of the Bridge, the Sign of a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on a Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say and over him written▪ Wansford in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Coming South from hence we passed Stilton, a Town famous for Cheese, which is called our English Parmesan, and is brought to Table with the Mites, or Maggots <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound it, so thick, that they bring a Spoon with them for you to eat the Mites with, as you do the Cheese.</P>
<P>Hence we came through Sautrey-lane, a deep Descent between two Hills, in which is Stangate hole, famous for being the most noted Robbing-place in all this part of the Country. Hence we pass'd to Huntington, the County Town, other∣wise not considerable; it is full of very good Inns, is a strong Pass upon the Ouse, and in the late times of Rebellion it was esteemed so by both Parties.</P>
<P>Here are the most beautiful Meadows on the Banks of the River Ouse, that I think are to be seen in any part of Eng∣land; and to see them in the Summer∣season, covered with such innumerable Stocks of Cattle and Sheep, is one of the most agreeable Sights of its kind in the World.</P>
<P>This Town has nothing remarkable in it; 'tis a long continued Street, pretty well built, has three Parish Churches, and a pretty good Market-place; but the Bridge, or Bridges rather, and Caus∣way over the Ouse is a very great Or∣nament to the Place.</P>
<P><PB REF="326"/>
On the West Side of this Town, and in View of the plain lower Side of the County, is a noble, tho' ancient Seat, of the Earl of Sandwich, the Gardens very fine and well kept; the Situation seems a little ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur'd by the Town of Huntington. In the same Plain we saw Bugden, a small Village, in which is remarkable a very pleasant, tho' ancient House or Palace, of the Bishops of Lincoln: The House and Garden surrounded by a very large and deep Moat of Water; the House is old, but pleasant, the Chappel very pret∣ty, tho' small; there is an Organ painted against the Wall, but in a seeming Organ∣loft, and so properly placed and well painted, that we at first believed it really to be an Organ.</P>
<P>Hinchingbrook, another House belong∣ing to a noble Family, well known by the same Title, shews itself at a small Distance from Huntington; and a little Way South stands that most nobly situated and plea∣sant Seat of the Duke of Manchester, cal∣led Kin▪bolton, or Kimbolton Castle, where no Pains or Cost has been spar'd to make the most beautiful Situation still more beautiful, and to help Nature with Art.</P>
<P>Hence we went a little North to see Oundle, being told that the famous Drum was to be heard just at that Time in the Well; but when we came there, they shew'd us indeed the Well and the Town, but as for the Drum, they could only tell us they heard of it, and that it did Drum; but we could meet with no Person of sufficient Credit, that would say seriously they had heard it: So we came away dis∣satisfy'd.</P>
<P>This Town of Oundle is pleasanly seat∣ed on the River Nyne, of which I have so often spoken. There are indeed a Range of eminent Towns upon this Ri∣ver; (viz.) Northampton, Wellingborough, Thrapston, Oundle, Fotheringay, Wands∣ford, and Peterborough; at all which, except Peterborough, there are very good Stone Bridges over the River.</P>
<P>Here again there is a most beautiful Range of Meadows, and perhaps they are not to be equalled in England for length; they continue uninterrupted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above thirty Miles in length, from Peter borough to Northampton, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Places, are near two Miles i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Land rich, the Grass sine and good, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Cattle, which are always <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them, Hay-time excepted, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>From Oundle we cross'd the County of Northampton into Bedfordshire, and par∣ticularly to the Town of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> chief Town of the County; for this County has no City in it, tho' even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town is larger and more populous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> several Cities in England, having five <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Churches, and a great many, and tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wealthy and thriving Inhab <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nts. This is one of the six Counties, which they say lie together, and have not one City among them; namly, Huntington, Bed∣ford, Bucks, Berks, Hertford, Essex, and Suffolk.</P>
<P>But here I must do a Piece of justice to the Usage of England in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Cities, namely, that it is not here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in France, and Flanders, and Hol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, where almost all their Towns of Note are called Cities, and here the Gentry chief∣ly live in those Cities, and the Clergy al∣so; I mean the Religious Houses, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are great Number▪ sometimes in one City, which are enough to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a City▪ where there was none before.</P>
<P>But as we have no Authority▪ but an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ent Usage and Custom, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Places by the Names of Towns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cities, so since that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Usage of Au∣thority had the Titles of Places, 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣servable some Places, formerly of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are considerably decayed, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce pre∣serve the Face of their ancient Greatness; as Lincoln, Old Sarum, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and others; and several Towns wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in those Times scarce deserved the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Cities, are now, by the Encrea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Commerce and Numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Inhabitants▪ become greater, more populous and wealthy, than others, which are called Cities.</P>
<P>Nor is this all, but several Towns, which Mr. Cambden tells us, were call'd Cities in his Time, are now sunk from

<P>Another Thing is searce to be equalled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of Britain; namely, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Ouse, by a long and winding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute, cuts through the County, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long Reachings, so as to make above <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yte Miles between Oulney and St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots, tho' n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> above twenty by Land, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in in all that Course it receives but one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yer into it, namely, the little River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el which falls into the Ouse a little a-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve Tem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford.</P>

<P>Here is the best Market for all Sorts of Provisions, that is to be seen at any Country Town in all these Parts of Eng∣land; and this Occasions, that tho' it is so far from London, yet the Higglers or Carriers buy great Quantities of Provisi∣ons here for London Markets; also here is a very good Trade down the River to Lynn.</P>
<P>Here is also a great Corn Market, and great Quantities of corn are bought here, and carryed down by Barges and other Boats to Lynn, where it is again shipp'd, and carryed by Sea to Holland the Soil hereabouts is exceeding rich and fertile, and particularly prodnces great Quantities of the best Wheat in England, which is carry'd by Waggons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and from the North Part of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nty twenty Miles beyond this▪ to the Markets of Hitchin and Hertsord, and bought again there, and ground and c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>yed in the Meal (s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l by Land) to London.</P>

<P>The last of these was almost demolish∣ed by a terrible Fire, which happen'd here just before my writing this Account; but as this Town has the good Luck to be∣long to a noble Family, particularly em∣inent for being good Landlords; that is to say; bountiful and munisicent to their poor Tenants, I mean the Ducal House of Bedford; there is no doubt but that the Trustees, tho' his Grace the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent Duke is in his Minority, will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve

that good Character to the Family, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edify the Town, which is almost all their own.</P>
<P>The Duke's House, call'd Wooburn Ab∣bey, is just by the Town, a good old House, but very ancient, spacious and convenient rather than fine, but exceed∣ingly pleasant by its Situation; and for the great quantity of Beach Woods which surround the Parts and cover the Hills, and also for great Woods of Oak too, as rich and valuable, as they are great and magnificent: The very Situation of this House does promise i self another Burleigh or Charsworth, whenever an Heir comes to enjoy the vast Estate of this Family, who has a Gerius for Building. But at present, as above the Heir is an Insant.</P>
<P>Ampthill is grated like Wooburn; for tho' in itself, like the other, it is not a considerable Town, and has no particular Manufacture to enrich it, yet the Neigh∣bourhood of that great and noble Family of Bruce Earls of Ailesbury, the very Town is made both rich and honourable: It is however the Misfortune of this no∣ble Family, that the present Earl lives a∣broad, being Roman; but the next <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are in view of recovering the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that ancient Family. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Seat of the Family is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and is a noble and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tho' not wholly re built, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> tune of many of the Seats <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of this Age</P>

<P>THE same Reasons which occasioned an Appendix to the last Journies hold good still, and will hold, if one hundred Journies of the same Kind were to be written; seeing no Man can take so strict a view of England, but something will occur, which the nicest Observer could not possibly see, or the most busy Enquiry be inform'd of at one Journey: and, which is still more, some things will be undertaken and begun in the smallest In∣tervals of Time, which were not heard of before; for example:</P>

1. On a more exact Enquiry into the particular State of the City of Bristol, I find it necessary to mention first, That there are but seventeen Parishes in the City, tho' there are nineteen Churches, including the Cathedral and the Church of St. Mark: There are besides those Churches, seven Meeting-Houses, two Presbyteri∣an, one Independent, two Quakers, one Baptist; also one or two other Meetings not to be nam'd.</P>
<P>As to the Exchange design'd to be built, and for which an Act of Parlia∣ment actually pass'd Ann. 1723. it was at first intended to be built where the T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lsey now is; but so many Buildings both publick and private (and one Church, namely Christ Church, at the Corner of Vine-street▪ standing so near, as that they would crowd the place too much, the first Measures were chang'd, and now the intended Place is the Meal Market, between Vine street and St. Mary Port, being on the North side of the Tolsey; but the Citizens do not seem so hasty to Build, as they were to get the Act of Parliament pass'd to give them Power to do it.</P>
<P>There are no less than fifteen Glass∣houses in Bristol, which is more than are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the City of London: They have in∣deed a very great Expence of Glass Bottles: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y sending them fill'd with Beer, Cyder, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Wine to the West Indies, much more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an goes from London; also great Num∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of Bottles, even such as is almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e edible, are now used for sending the Waters of St. Vincent's Rock away, which are now carry'd, not all over Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd only, but, we may say, all over the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld</P>

<P>Also here is the following Inscription on the Monument of Sir William Penn, Bart▪ the Father of the great William Penn, one of the Heads of the Quakers, who was a Native of the City of Bristol: as follows.</P>
<P>To the just Memory of Sir William Penn, Knt. and sometime General; borne at Bristol, in 1621, Son of Capt. Giles Penn, several Years Consul for the English in the Mediterranean: Descend∣ed from the Penns of Penn Lodge in the County of Wilts, and the Penns of Penn near Wickham in the County of Bucks; and, by his Mother, from the Gilberts in the County of Somerset, originally from Yorkshire; addicted from his Youth to Maritime Affairs. He was made Captain at the Years of 21, Rear-Admiral of Ireland at 23, Vice-Admiral of Ireland at 25, Admiral to the Streights at 29, Vice-Admiral at 31, and General of the first Dutch Wars at 32: whence retiring, in Anno 1655, he was chosen Parliament Man for the Town of Weymouth 1660, made Com∣missioner of the Admiral and Navy, Go∣vernour of the Towns and Forts of Kingsaile, Vice-Admiral of Munster, and a Member of the Provincial Coun∣cell; and, in Anno 1664, was chosen Great Captain Commander under his Royal Highness, in that signal and most prudently successful Fight against the Dutch Fleet. Thus he took Leave of the Sea, his old Element, but continu∣ed still his other Employs 'till 1669, at what Time, thro' Bodily In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mities (contracted by the Care and Fatigue of the publick Affairs) he withdrew, pre∣par'd, and made for his End, and with a gentle and even Gale, in much Peace, arrived and anchored in his last and best Port, at Wanstead in the County of Essex, on the 16th of September, 167<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, being than but 49 and 4 Months Old. To whose Name and Merit his Surviv∣ing Lady hath erected this Remem∣brance.</P>
<P>In Travelling this latter Part of this second Tour, it has not been taken Notice of, though it very well deserves Mention; what Soil of all the Midland Part of Eng∣land, even from Sea to Sea, is of a de p stiff Clay, or Marly Kind, and it carries a Breadth of near 50 Miles at least, in some Places mcuh more; nor is it possible to go from London to any Part of Britain, North, without crossing this clayey dirty Part. For Example;</P>
<P N="1">1. Suppose we take the great Northern Post Road from London to York, and so into Scotland; you have tolerable good Ways and hard Ground, 'till you reach Royston about 32, and to Kneesworth, a Mile farther: But from thence you enter upon the Clays, which beginning at the famous Arrington-Lanes, and going on to Caxton, Huntington, Stilton, Stamf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd,

<P N="2">2. Suppose you take the other Northern <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oad, namely, by St. Albans, Dunstable, Hockley, Newport Pagnel, Northampton, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eicester, and Nottingham, or Darby: On his Road, after you are pals'd Dunstable, which, as in the other Way, is about 30 Miles, you enter the deep Clays, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so surprisingly soft, that it is perfect∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> frightful to Travellers, and it has been he Wonder of Foreigners, how, con∣dering the great Numbers of Carri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges which are continually passing with heavy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oads, those Ways have been made practi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble; indeed the great Number of Horses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery Year killed by the Excess of La∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our in those heavy Ways, has been such Charge to the Country, that new Build∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g of Causeways, as the Romans did of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems to me to be a much easier <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> From Hockley to Northampton, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence to Harborough, and Leicester, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence to the very Bank of Trent these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrible Clays continue; at Nottingham <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are pass'd them, and the Forest of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwood yields a hard and pleasant Road <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 30 Miles together.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take the same Road as it leads to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ventry, and from thence to West Ches∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, the deep Clays reach through all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owns of Brickhill Fenny and Stony <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>atford, Towcester, Daventry, Hill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otton, or Dunchurch, Coventry, Coles∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, and even to Birmingham, for very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar 80 Miles.</P>
<P N="4">4. If we take the Road to Worcester, is the the same through the Vale of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesbury to Buckingham, and Westward Banbury, Keynton, and the Vale of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esham, where the Clays reach, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Intermissions, even to the Bank of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ern, as they do more Northernly quite West Chester.</P>
<P>The Reasons of my taking Notice of this Badness of the Roads, through all the Midland Counties, is this; that as these are Counties which drive a very great Trade with the City of London, and with one another, perhaps the greatest of any Counties in England; and that, by con∣sequence, the Carriage is exceeding great, and also that all the Land Carriage of the Northern Counties necessarily goes through these Counties, so the Roads had been plow'd so deep, and Materials have been in some Places so difficult to be had for Repair of the Roads, that all the Survey∣ors Rates have been able to do nothing; nay, the very whole Country has not been able to repair them; that is to say, it was a Burthen too great for the poor Farmers; for in England it is the Tenant, not the Landlord, that pays the Surveyors of the Highways Charge.</P>
<P>This necessarily brought the Country to bring these Things before the Parlia∣ment; and the Consequence has been, that Turn pikes or Toll bars have been set up on the several great Roads of Eng∣land, beginning at London, and proceed∣ing thro' almost all those dirty deep Roads, in the Midland Counties especially; at which Turn-pikes, all Carriages, Droves of Cattle, and Travellers on Horse-back, are oblig'd to pay an easy Toll; that is to say, a Horse a Penny, a Coach three Pence, a Cart four Pence, at some six Pence to eight Pence, a Waggon six Pence, in some a Shilling, and the like; Cattle pay by the Score, or by the Head, in some Places more, in some less; but in no Place is it thought a Burthen that ever I met with, the Benefit of a good Road abundantly making amends for that little Charge the Travellers are put to at the Turn-pikes.</P>
<P>Several of these Turn-pikes and Tolls have been set up of late Years, and great Progress had been made in mending the most difficult Ways, and that with such Success as well deserves a Placa in this Account: And this is one Reason for taking Notice of it in this Manner; for
<PB REF="332"/>
as the memory of the Romans, which is so justly famous, is preserv'd in nothing more visible to common Observation, than in the Remains of those noble Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣ways and Highways, which they made through all parts of the Kingdom, and which were found so needful, even then, when there was not the five hundredth part of the Commerce and Carriage that is now: How-much more valuable must these new Works he, tho' nothing to compare with those of the Romans, for the Firmness and Duration of their Work?</P>
<P>The Causways and Roads, or Street∣ways of the Romans, were perfect solid Buildings, the Foundations were laid so deep, and the Materials so good, how∣ever far they were oblig'd to fetch them, that if they had been vaulted and arch'd, they could not have been more solid: I have seen the Bottom of them dug up in several Places, where I have observ'd Flint-stones, Chalk-stones, hard Gravel, solid hard Clay, and several other sorts of Earth, laid in Layers, like the Veins of Oar in a Mine; a laying of Clay of a solid binding Quality, then Flint-stones, then Chalk, then upon the Chalk rough Ballast or Gravel, 'till the whole Work has been raised six or eight Foot from the Bottom; then it has been covered with a Crown or rising Ridge in the middle, gently sloping to the sides, that the Rain might run off every way, and not soak into the Work: This I have seen as fair and firm, after having stood, as we may conclude▪ at least 12 or 1600 Years, as if it had been made but the Year before.</P>
<P>And that I may not be charged with going beyond the most exact Truth, I re∣fer the Curious to make their Observa∣tions upon that Causeway, call'd the Fosse, which is now remaining, and to be seen between Cirencester and Marshfield in Wiltshire, on the Road to the Bath, or between the same Cirencester and Bird∣lip Hill in Gloucestershire, on the Road to Gloucester: but more particularly, be∣tween Castleford Bridge, near Poutefrad in Yorkshire, upon the River A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Town of Aberford in the Road to Tadcaster and York.</P>
<P>In several Parts of this Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seway, the Country being hard, and the way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on either side, Travellers have not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much Use of the Causeway, it being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay high, and perhaps exposing them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much to the Wind and W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have rather chosen to go on either side, so that the Causeway in some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laces, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s as flat and smooth on the Top, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it had never been made Use of at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and perhaps it has not, there being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so much as the mark of a Wheel upon it, or of a Horse Foot for a good w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> together, for which I refer to the ca∣ous Traveller that goes that way.</P>
<P>This very Causway have I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> into, so as to discover the very Materials with which it was built; and in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e parts of the same Causway, farther North, where the great Road has taken <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at other way. I have seen the ol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y dug down to carry the Materials away, and mend the Road which was th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Use.</P>
<P>It is true the Romans being Lord o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World, had the Command of the People, their Persons and their Work, their Cattle, and their Carriages; even their Armies were employ'd in the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e noble Undertakings; and if the materials they wanted, were to fetch 20, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to 40 Miles off, if they wanted them, they would have them, and the Works were great and magnificent like them∣selves: Witness the numberless Encam∣ments, Lines, Castles and Fortifications which we see the Remains of to this Day.</P>
<P>But now the Case is alter'd, Labour is dear, Wages high, no Man works for Bread and Water now; our Labour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs do not work in the Road, and drink <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Brook; so that as rich as we are it would exhaust the whole Nation to build the Edifices, the Causways, the Aqueducts, Lines, Castles, Fortifications,
<PB REF="333"/>
and other publick Works, which the Ro∣mans built with very little Expence.</P>
<P>But to return to this new Method of repairing the Highways at the Expence of the Turn-pikes; that is to say, by the Product of Funds rais'd at those Turn-pikes; it must be acknowledg'd they are very great Things, and very great Things are done by them; and 'tis well worth recording, for the Honour of the pre∣sent Age▪ that this Work has been be∣gun, and is in an extraordinary Manner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arry'd on, and perhaps may, in a great measure be compleated within our memo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. I shall give some Examples here of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose which have been brought to Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ection already, and of others which are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow carrying on.</P>
<P>First, that great County of Essex, of which our first Tour gives an ample Account. The great Road from London, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hro' this whole County towards Ips∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich and Harwich, is the most worn with Waggons, Carts, and Carriages; and with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Droves of Black Cattle, Hogs, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Sheep, of any Road (that leads thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o larger an Extent of Country) in Eng∣land: The length of it from Stratford∣bridge by Bow, to Strectford▪bridge over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Stour, on the side of Su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>olk, is 50 Miles, and to Harwich above 65 Miles.</P>
<P>These Roads were formerly deep▪ in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of Floods dangerous, and at other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes, in Winter, scarce passable; they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e now so firm, so safe, so easy to Tra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellers, and Carriages as well as Cattle, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat no Road in England can yet be said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o equal them; this was first done by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e help of a Turnpike, set up by Act <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Parliament, about the Year 1697, at Village near Ingerstone. Since that, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>other Turnpike, set up at the Corner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Dog-Row, near Mile-End; with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> additional one at Rumford, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled a Branch, and paying at one, pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s the Person thro' both: This I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing set up since the other, compleats <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whole, and we are told, that as the first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pires in a Year or two, this last will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient for the whole, which will be a great Ease to the Country: The first Toll▪near Ingerstone, being the highest rated publick Toll in England, for they take 8 d. for every Cart, 6 d. for every Coach, and 12 d. for every Waggon; and in proportion for Droves of Cattle: For single Horse-men indeed, it is the same as others pay, viz. 1 d, per Horse, and we are told, while this is doing, that the Gentlemen of the County, design to Petition the Parliament, to have the Com∣missioners of the last Act, whose Turn∣pike, as above▪ is at Mile-End and Rum∣ford, empowered to place other Turn∣pikes on the other most considerable Roads, and so to Undertake, and Repair all the Roads in the whole County, I mean all the considerable Roads.</P>
<P>But to come back to the Counties which I am now speaking of, some very good attempts have been made of this kind on the Northern Roads, thro' those deep ways I mentioned, in the High Post Road; for example,</P>
<P>That an Act of Parliament was ob∣tained about 30 Years since, for repair∣ing the Road between Ware and Roy∣ston, and a Turnpike was erected for it at Wade's mill, a Village so called, about a mile and half beyond Ware: This proved so effectual, that the Road there, which was before scarce passable, is now built up in a high, firm Causeway; the most like those mentioned above, of the Ro∣mans, of any of these new Undertakings. And, though this Road is continually worked upon, by the vast numbers of Carriages, bringing Malt and Barly to Ware, for whose sake indeed, it was obtained, yet, with small Repairs it is maintained, and the Toll is reduced from a Penny to a Halfpenny, for the Ease of the country, and so in proportion.</P>
<P>Beyond this, two Grants have been obtained; one for repair of those wretched Places, called Arrington Lanes, and all the Road beyond Royston, to Caxton and Huntington; and another, for repair∣ing the road from Stukely to Stilton, in∣cluding
<PB REF="334"/>
the place called Stangate Hole, and so on, towards Wansford and Santry Lane and Peterborough; by which these Roads, which were before intollerable, are now much mended, but I cannot say, they are yet come up to the Perfection of that Road from London to Colchest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</P>
<P>One great Difficulty indeed here, is, that the Country is so Universally made up of a deep▪ stiff Clay, that 'tis hard to find any Materials to repair the Ways with, that may be depended upon In some Places they have a red sandy kind of a Slate or Stone, which they lay with Timber and green Faggots, and puts them to a very great Expence; but this Stone does not bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d like Chalk and Gravel, or endure like Flint and Pebbles, but wears into Clay from whence it proceeds; and this is the reason why they cannot expect those Roads can reach up, however chargeable the repairs are to the goodness of the Roads in E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ex.</P>
<P>We see also a Turnpike set up at a Vil∣lage very justly called Foul Mire near Cambridge, for the repair of the particular Roads to the University, but those Works are not yet brought to any Perfection.</P>
<P>There is another Road, which is a Branch of the Northern Road, and is pro∣perly called the Coach Road, which, and comes into the other near S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gate Hole; and this indeed is a most frightful Way, if we take it from Hatfield, or rather the Park Corners of Hatfield House, and from thence to Stevenage, to Baldock, to Bid∣gleswade, and Bugden. Here is that fa∣mous Lane called Baldock Lane, famous for being so unpassable, that the Coaches and Travellers were obliged to break out of the Way even by Force, which the People of the Country not able to pre∣vent, at length placed Gates, and laid their Lands open, setting Men at the Gates to take a voluntary Toll, which Travellers always chose to pay, rather than plunge into Sloughs and Holes, which no Horses could wade through.</P>
<P>This terrible Road is now under Cure by the same Methods, and probably may in Time be brought to be firm and solid, the Chalk and Stones being not so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fetch here, as in some of those other Places I have just now mention'd.</P>
<P>But the Repair of the Roads in the County, namely Bedfordshire, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> easy a Work, as in some other Parts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England The Drifts of Cattle, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come this Way out of Lincolnsh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and the Fens of the Isle of Ely, of which I have spoken already, are so great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> constantly coming up to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it is much more difficult to make the Ways good, where they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treading by the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et of the larg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bullocks, of which the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come this way are scarce to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up, and which make deep <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the Ground is not very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and often work through in the Winter what the Commissioners have mended in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Summer.</P>
<P>But leaving these Uundertakings to speak for themselves when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for they can neither be justly prais'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sur'd before; it ought to be observ'd there is another Road branching <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this deep Way at Stevenage, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thence to Hitchin, to Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fford, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ford. Hitchin is a large Market <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows▪ and particularly eminent for its burg a great Corn Market for Whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but especially the first, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here for London Market. The Road to Hitchin, and thence to Bedford, tho' not a great Thorough▪fare for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a very useful Highway for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Carriages, which bring Wheat from Bedford to that Market, and from the Country round it, even as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar as North∣amptonshire, and the Edge of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and many Times the Country People are not able to bring their Coin for the meer Badness of the Ways.</P>
<P>This Road, I hear, will be l k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wise re∣pair'd, by Virtue of a Turn pike to be plac'd near Hitchin on this S de▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the two Bridges over the Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, namely Barford Bridge and Bedford Bridge, on the other Side; as also at Temsford, where they drive through the River without the help of a Bridge.</P>
<P><PB REF="335"/>
But to leave what may be. I return to what is. The next Turn pikes are on the great North West Road, or as I have dis∣tinguish'd it already, the Watling-street Way; which, to describe it once for all, begins at Is<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ington near London, and leads to Shrewsbury, West Chester, and Holly∣head in Wales; with other Branches breaking out from it to the North, lead∣ing to Nottingham, Darby, Burton on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat, and Warrington▪ and from them all, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her North, into the North West <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Great Britain; for they are the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Passes into Yorkshire, Darbyshire, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and thro' them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and, Cumberland, Durham, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of all which I shall give <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Account in my next Let<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers.</P>
<P>Upon the g eat Road there are wonder∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Improvements made and making, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> T aveller can mils the Observation of, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pecially if he knew the Condition these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays were formerly in; nor can my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these Counties be perfect, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Notice of it; for certainly no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Edifice, Alms house▪ Hospital, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obleman's Palace, can be of equal Value <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Country with this, no nor more an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Ornament to it.</P>
<P>The first Attempt upon this Road was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Buckinghamshire, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was set up on the Hill, near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town call'd Little Brick-hill, by ver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which, they repaired the Road from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Stony Stratford, for about ten <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and with very good Success; for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Road wa broad, and capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for such a Work; and tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were hard to come a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and far to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet we soon sound a large fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Highway, and of a f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reaching from Fenny Stratford, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ony Stratford which is six Miles, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Way was exceeding bad before. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his encouraged the Country to set at the Work in good earnest; and we see the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Piece of Ground Travelling, that ever was in England, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fomly repair'd; namely, from the of the chalky Hill beyond Dunstable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into Hockley Lane, and thro' Hock∣ley, justly called Hockley in the Hole, to Newport <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gnaci, being a bye Branch of the great Road, and leading to North∣ampton, and was called the Coach Road; but such a Road for Coaches, as worse was hardly ever seen.</P>
<P>Thee next (to come Southward) was the Road from St. Albans to South Mims, a Village beyond Barnet: Soon after this Road parts from the great Coach Road to the North, which I mentioned before, be∣ginning at Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field.</P>
<P>This Road, from M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms to St▪ Albans▪ is so well mended, the Work so well done, and the Materials so good▪ so plentifully furnished, and so faithfully apply'd, that, in short, if possible, it out does the Essex Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d mentioned before; for here the Bottom is not only repair'd, but the nar∣row Places are widen'd. Hills levell'd, Bottoms raised, and the Ascents and De∣scents made easy, to the inexpressible Ease and Advantage of Travellers, and especial∣ly of the Carriers, who draw heavy Goods and hard Loads, who find the Benefit in the Health and Strength of their Cattle.</P>
<P>From hence, to come still more towards London, another Undertaking reaches from the Foot of Barnet Hill, call'd for∣merly the Blockhouse, to Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stone, and so over the great Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, calld Finchley Common, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ighgate Hill, and up the Hill to the Garehouse at Highgate, where they had their Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; as also at the Blockhouse; and this Work is also admir∣ably well perform'd, and thro' a Piece of Ground, which was very full of Sloag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and deep Places before.</P>
<P>But from Highgate to London still re∣quired help; the Road branch'd into two, at the Top of Highgate Hill, or just at the Gatehouse there; one came to London by Islington, and there branch'd again in∣to two, one coming by the North End of Islington, and another on the Back of the Town, and entring the Town at the South West End near the Angel Inn, there di∣viding again, one Branch entred London at Goswell street and Aldersgate street; and this was the principal Road for Wag∣gons and Pack horses: The other going
<PB REF="336"/>
directly to St. John-street and into Smith∣field; and this way was the chief road for cattle to Smithfield Market.</P>
<P>The other Road parting off at High∣gate, came down the Hill by the late Sir William Ashurst's House, of which I made mention in its Plece, and thence passing through Kentish Town, entered London by two ways; one by Gray's Inn Lane, and the other by Clerkenwell.</P>
<P>All these Roads were to the last Ex∣tremity run to ruin, and grew worse and worse so evidently, that it was next to impossible, the country should be able to repait them: Upon which an Act of Parliament was obtained for a Turnpike, which is now erected at Islington afore∣said, as also all the other Branches by the Kentish Town way, and others; so that by this new Toll, all these Roads are now likely to be made good, which were before almost a scandal to the City of London.</P>
<P>Another Turnpike, and which was erected before this, was on the great North Road, beginning at Shoreditch, and extending to Enfield-street, in the way to Ware; though this road is ex∣ceedingly throng'd, and raises great Sums, yet I cannot say, that the road itself seems to be so evidentiy improved, and so effectually repaired, as the others last mentioned, notwithstanding no materials are wanting; even on the very Verge of the road itself, whether it be, that the number of Carriages, which come this way, and which are indeed greater than in any other road about London, is the Occasion, or whether the Persons con∣cerned do not so faithfuily, or so skil∣fully perform, I will not undertake to de∣termine.</P>
<P>After so many encouraging Examples on this great Watling-street Road, as I have mentioned above, they have now begun the like on the same way farther down, and particularly from Stony Strat∣ford to Daventry and Dunchurch, and so on to Coventry and Coles Hill; all those Parts of it are at this Time repair∣ing, and they promise themselves that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a few Years those Roads will be com∣pleatly sound and firm, as Watling-street was in its most ancient and flourishing State; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this must be mentioned, like any public Edifice, which is now Build∣ing, and perhaps may require some Time to finish.</P>
<P>I come next to mention other works of the same Kind in remoter Places, al∣so more Westerly, but within the com∣pass of this Midland Circuit; as parti∣cularly the Road from Birdlip <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Gloucester, formerly a terrible place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> poor Carriers and Travellers out of Wales, &amp;c. But now repaired very well</P>
<P>Likewise the Road from Sandy La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Hill in Wiltshire to the Bath, which began to be repaired by the Direction of her late Majesty Q. Anne.</P>
<P>Also another piece of had Road <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Beaconsfield in Oxfordshire.</P>
<P>By the same happy Example, T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣pikes are erected at the West <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Town, for repairing that ho r'd Road, formerly also a part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> street way, from St. Giles's Church to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and thence to Edgworth, obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first by the interest and motion of his Grace the Duke of Chandos.</P>
<P>On the other side of the River is another Turnpike erected, or rather two Turnpikes, one at the North End of the Town of Newington, called Newington Buts, which has two or three colateral Branches, viz. one at Vaux-Hall, at the Bridge near the Spring Garden corner, and another at Croyden, besides smaller Toll-Bars on the Bye-Lanes. This Un∣dertaking has been very well prosecuted, and the great Suffex Road, which was formerly unsufferably bad, is now be∣come admirably good; and this is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at so great an Expence, that they told me at Strettham, that one mile between the two next Bridges South of that Town, cost a thousand Pounds repairing, includ∣ing one of the Bridges, and yet it must be acknowledg'd, that the Materials are
<PB REF="337"/>

<P>Another Benefit of these new Measures for repairing the Roads by Turnpikes, is the opening of Drains and Water courses▪ and Building Bridges, especially over the smaller Waters, which are oftentimes the most dangerous to Travellers on hasty Rains, and always most injurious to the Roads, by lying in Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Puddles, to the great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling the Bottom, and making constant Sloughs, sometimes able to bury both Man and Horse; 'tis very remarkable that the Overseers of these Works take effectual Care to have Bridges built in such Places, and Currents made or opened for the Waters to pals, by which abundance of Labour is sav'd in constantly rending the Waters on such Occasions; but o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this also we shall say more presently.</P>
<P>To give an eminent Instance of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we refer the Curious to take the Road from Blackman-street in Southwa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k, to C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, for an Example, where, if we are not mistaken, he will find eleven Bridges whol∣ly new built in ten Miles length, by which was before a most uncomfortable Road to travel.</P>
<P>This improving of the Roads is an in∣finite Improvement to the Towns near London, in the Convenience of coming to them, which makes the Citizens flock out in greater Numbers than ever to take Lodgings and Country - Houses, which many, whose Business call'd them often to London, could not do, because of the Labour of riding forward and backward, when the Roads were but a little duty, and this is seen in the Difference in the Rents of Houses in those Villages upon such repair'd Roads, from the Rents of the like Dwellings and Lodgings in other Towns of equal Distance, where they want those Helps, and particularly the En∣crease of the Number of Buildings in those Towns, as above.</P>
<P><PB REF="338"/>
This probably has not been the least Reason why such Tolls are erected now on every Side of London, or soon will be, and I doubt not but in Time it will be the like all over England.</P>
<P>There are indeed some very deep Roads in many Places of England, and that South by Trent too, where no such Pro∣vision is yet made for Repair of the Roads, as partic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>larly in and through the Vale of Aylesbury, and to Buckingham, and beyond it into Oxfordshire; also be∣yond Northampton to Harborough and Leicester; also in Lincolnshire, beyond what we nam'd to be from Huntington to Stilton, the Road from Stamford to Grantham▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewark, and Tuxford, in the Clays, all which remain very deep, and in some Seasons dangerous.</P>
<P>Likewise the Roads in Sussex, and that in particular which was formerly a Roman Work, called Stony-street or Stone street: Mr. Cambden mentions it as going from Leatherhead to Darking, and thro' Dark∣ing Church-yard, then cross a terrible deep Country, call'd the Homeward, and so to Petworth and Arundel: But we see no∣thing of it now; and the Country indeed remains in the utmost Distress for want of good Roads: So also all over the Wild of Kent and Sussex it is the same, where the Corn is cheap at the Barn, because it can∣not be carry'd out; and dear at the Mar∣ke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, because it cannot be brought in.</P>
<P>But the Specimens above, will, we doubt not, prompt the Country Gentlemen in Time to go through with it all over Eng∣land; and 'tis to give a clear View of this important Case, that we have given this Account of them.</P>
<P>The Benefit of these Turnpikes appears now to be so great, and the People in all Places begin to be so sensible of it, that it is incredible what Effect it has already had upon Trade in the Countries where it is more compleatly finish'd; even the Carriage of Goods is abated in some Pla∣ces, 6 d. per hundred Weight, in some Places 12 d per hundred, which is abun∣dantly more advantage to Commerce, than the Charge paid amounts to, and yet at the same Time the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Carriers too, who make the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so that the Benefit in abating th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Carriage is wholly and simply the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not the Carriers.</P>
<P>Yet the Advantage is evident <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Carriers also another Way; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> observ'd before, they can <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Weight with the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nor are their Horses so hard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fatigued with their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before; in which one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> knowledg'd by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Work with more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are at less Expence.</P>
<P>The Advantage to all other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Travelling I omit here; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Ease to Gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> London on all Occasions, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Term, or to Parliament, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any other necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not a small Part of the Benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> new Methods.</P>

<P>A particular Example of this, I have mentioned already, viz. the bringing of Fat Cattle, especially Sheep to London in the Winter, from the remoter Counties of Leicester and Lincoln, where they are bred; by which the Country Gras<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers are obliged to sell their Stock-o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f, at the lat∣ter End of the Summer, namely Septem∣ber and October, when they sell cheap, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>chers and Farmers near London engross them, and keeping them 'till De∣cember and Janua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell them, tho' not an O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r than befor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, for an ad∣vanced Price, to the Citizens of London, whereas, were the Roads made good and passable, the City would be served with Mutton almost as cheap in the Winter as in the Summer, for the Profit of the Ad∣vance would be to the Graziers of Leicester and Lincolnshires, who were the original Breeders.</P>
<P>This is evidence to a Demonstration in the Counties of Essex and Suffolk, from whence they already bring their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Cat∣tle, and particularly their Mutton in Droves, from Sixty, Seventy, or Eighty Miles, without fatiguing, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g, or sinking the Flesh of the Creature<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, even in the Depth of Winter.</P>
<P>I might give Examples of other Bran∣ches of Inland Commerce, which would be quite altered for the better, by this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣storing the Goodness of the Roads, and particularly that of carrying Cheese, a Species of Provision so considerable, that nothing, except that of live Cattle, can exceed it.</P>
<P>This is chiefly made in the three North West Counties of England, viz. Cheshire, Gloucester, and Warwickshires, and the Pars adjacent, from whence the Nation is very meanly supply'd, by reason of the exceeding Distance of the Country where the Cheese is made, from those Counties where it is chiefly expended.</P>
<P>The Cheshire Men indeed carry great Quantities about by long Sea, as they call it, to London; a terrible long, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me∣times dangerous, Voyage, being thro' the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh Channel, round all Wales, cross the
<PB REF="340" MS="y"/>
Bristol Channel, round the Land's End of Cornwall, and up the English Channel to the Mouth of the Thames, and so up to London; or else by Land to Burton upon Trent, and so down that river to Gaines∣borough and Hull, and so by Sea to Lon∣don.</P>
<P>Again, the Gloucestershire Men carry all by Land-Carriage to Lechlade and Cricklade on the Thames, and so carry it down the River to London.</P>
<P>But the Warwic#shire Men have no Water Carriage at all, or at least not 'till they have carry'd it a long Way by Land to Oxford; but as their Quantity is ex∣ceed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng great, and they supply not only the City of London, but also the Coun∣ties of Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Hertford, Bedford, and Nor∣thampton, the Gross of their Carriage is by meer dead Draught, and they carry it either to London by Land, which is full an hundred Miles, and so the London Cheesmongers supply the said Counties of Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, besides Kent, and Sussex, and Surrey by Sea and River Navigation: or the Warwickshire Men carry it by Land once a Year to Stur∣bridge Fair, whence the Shop-keepers of all the Inland Country above-named, come to buy it; in all which Cases Land▪Car∣riage being long, and the Ways bad, makes it very dear to the Poor, who are the Con∣sumers.</P>
<P>But were the Ways from Warwickshire made good, as I have shewn they ate al∣ready in Essex, and some other Places; this Carriage would be perform'd for little more than half the Price that it now is, and the Poor would have their Provisions much cheaper.</P>
<P>I could enlarge here upon the Con∣venience that would follow such a restor∣ing the Ways, for the carrying of Fish from the Sea Coasts to the Inner Parts of the Kingdom, where, by re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Badness of the Ways, they cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carry them sweet; This would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> encrease the Consumption of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Season, which now for that very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is but small, and would employ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> numerable Number of Horses and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well as encrease the Shippi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g by that Consumption.</P>
<P>By this Carriage of Fish. I do n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean the carrying Herrin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to London, as is practis'd on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Sussex and Kent in particular, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Salmon from the remote river<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Treat; but the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arying of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mackerell, and Sprats in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Whitings and flat Fish at other Times, from the Coasts of Yarmouth, Swole, Ipswich, Colchester, Malden, &amp;c. and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up∣plying all the Inland Counties with them sweet and good, which 'tis plain they might do, were the Roads made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even as far as Northampton, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and farther too.</P>
<P>I might give Examples where the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rings, which are not the best Fish to keep neither, are, even as it is, carry'd to those Towns, and up to Warwick, Birmingham, Tamworth and Stafford, and tho' they frequently stink before they come thither, yet the People are so eager of them, that they buy them, and give dear for them too; whereas were the Roads good, they would come in less Time, by at least two Days in Six, and teu-fold the Quantity nay, some say, an hundred Times th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Quantity, be consum'd.</P>
<P>These, and many others, are the Ad∣vantages to our Inland Commerce, which we may have Room to hope for upon the general Repair of the Roads, and which I shall have great Occasion to speak of again in my Northern Circuit that is yet to come.</P>

<P>AS I am to begin this Circuit from the River Trent, and to confine my Observations to that Part of Britain which the Scots Northumberlanders, and others on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> side, call North by Trent, it seems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (at least it cannot be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to give some Desription of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and especially the course which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by which, adding a little River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Weaver, and a Branch of it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Dane in Staffordshire and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole Island of Britain is, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divided into two Parts.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he River Trent is rated by ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the Third River in England, two greater being the Thames and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evern: It is also one of the Six <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rivers which running across the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the West to the East, all begin the Letter <HI>T;</HI> namely, the <HI>Thames,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Tees▪ Tire, Tweed,</HI> and <HI>Tay.</HI></P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trent is not the largest River of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet it may be said to run the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Course of any of them, and rises <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the West Verge of the Island any of the longest course of any in England, which does not empty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aters immediately into the Sea; for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent runs into the Humber, and Waters lose their Name before they to the Ocean.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Hills or Highlands of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called the Moorlands, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the Edge of Cheshire, and towards Lancashire, a great many (some say thirty, and that thence it had its Name) little Rivulets into it, very near its Head, all which may claim a share in being the Originals of the Trent; th u st soon becomes one large River, and comes down from the Hills with a violent Cur∣rent into the flat country; where, being encreased by several other little Rivers, it carries a deeper Channel, and a stiller Current; and having given its Name to Trentham, a small Market Town in the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Road to West-Chester.</P>
<P>The Original of its Name is very un∣certain, as is the Case in most other Ri∣vers of England; then it takes the Name of Trent, as above, because there are thirty several Sorts of Fish in it, or that, like the Tibiscus in Hungary, it is three Parts Water, and two Parts Fish; all these the learned and judicious Mr. Cambden rejects, as I do for the same Reason, namely, because they have no Authority for the Suggestion.</P>
<P>One Branch of the Trent rises within a Quarter of a Mile of the Dane, viz. from a Moor adjoining to, or Part of a little Ridge of Hills called Molecop Hill, near Congleton, and is within twenty two Miles of the Irish Sea, or that Arm or Inlet of the Sea which the Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e makes from Frodsham to Liverpool and Hyle-lake; and as the Dane runs into the Weaver, and both into that Arm of the Sea, and the Trent into the Humber,
<PB REF="342"/>
which opens into the great German O∣cean, those Rivers may be said to cut the Island cross in the middle.</P>
<P>It is true the Northern Part is much larger than the Southern, now Scotland is united; otherwise the Country South by Trent, including Wales, is by far the largest: But it must be allowed still▪ that the Country South by Trent is the richest by far, and most populous; occasioned chiefly by the City of London, and the Commerce of the Thames; as for the Cities of Bristol, Exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, and Norwich, which are large and very populous, and in some things drive a prodigious Trade, as well in Merchandise as Manufacture, we shall find them matched, if not out∣done, by the growing Towns of Liver∣pool, Hull, Leeds, Newcastle, and Man∣chester, and the Cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow▪ as shall be shown in its Place.</P>
<P>The Trent runs a Course of near two hundred Miles, through the four Coun∣ties of Stafford, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln; it receives, besides lesser▪ Wa∣ters▪ the larger Rivers of the Sowe from the West Side▪ of the County▪ and from the Town of Stafford; the Tame from Birmingham and Tamworth; the Soar from Leicester; and the Dove and Der∣went, two furiously rapid Streams, from the Peak of Derby; the Idle, a gentle navigable Stream from Rhetford and Not∣tinghamshire; with Part of the Whittham, called the Fossd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke from Lincoln, also navigable; and the greatest of them all, the Don, from Doncaster, Rothram▪ and Sheffield, after a long and rapid Course through the Moors called S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onecross on the Edge of Derby, and the West▪riding of Yorkshire.</P>
<P>The Trent is navigable by Ships of good Burthen as high as Gainsbrough, which is near 40 Miles from the Hum∣ber by the River. The Barges without the help of Locks or Stops go as high as Nottingham, and farther by the Help of Art, to Burton upon Trent in Stafford∣shire. The Stream is full, the Channel deep and safe, and the Tide flows up a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Way between Gai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sborough and Newark.

'tis full of Wonders; and indeed there are abundance of Re∣markables in it: (1.) 'Tis remarkable for the Soil, which on the South Part is the richest and most fruitful: and on the North Part the most wild and waste, and next to barren of any Part of England within many Miles of it.

old Castle, but when, we know not; so that if we may plead its Antiquity 'tis only because we have no Account of of its Beginning; the oldest thing that we read of it is, that there was a Tower here which the Danes obstinately defended against King Alfred, and his Brother Aethelred.</P>
<P>This Castle, or some other Building in the Room of it, remained till the Time of the late Wars; 'tis evident it was standing in the Queen Elizabeth; Mr. Cambden says, William the Norman built it; and, as he says, it was done to awe the English; it was so strong that nothing could ever reduce it but Famine; after this it was repair'd and beautified, or ra∣ther rebuilt by Edward IV. who added fine Apartments to it, which Richard III. his Brother inlarged.</P>
<P>It was so strong, it seems, that it had not been subject to the ordinary fate of other fortified Places; namely, to be of∣ten taken and retaken; for it was never storm'd, that is to say, never taken Sword in Hand; once it was indeed taken by Surprize in the Barons Wars by Robert Earl Ferrers, who also plundered the Town, (City 'twas then call'd.)</P>
<P>The stories that People tells us here, of one of the Davids, King of Scotland, kept Prisoner in it, I believe little of, any more than I do that of Roger Mor∣timer Earl of March, and his being hid in a Vault under Ground in this Castle, whence being discovered, he was taken, brought to Justice, and hang'd for Trea∣son; yet the Place where they say he was taken, is shewed still to Strangers, and is call'd Mortimers Hole, to this Day. It is true, that here are such Places, Mr. Camden also gives an Account that in the first Court of the Castle there is a way down by a great many steps to a Vault under Ground, where there are Chambers cut out of the Stone, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People offer'd to carry us down <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did not like the Aspect of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rather to take their words.</P>

<P>The Trent is Navigable here for Ves∣s or Barges of great burthen, by which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their heavy and bulky Goods are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought from the Humber, and even from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such as Iron.

Wood, Corn; also Cheese in great Quantities, from Warwickshire and Staffordshire. By which the Commerce of these Countries is greatly increased, as I have mentioned already.</P>
<P>When I said the Bridge over Trent had nineteen Arches, I might as well have said the Bridge was a Mile long; for the Trent being, at the last time I was there, swelled over its ordinary Bound, the Ri∣ver reached quate up the Town; yet a high <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>way with Arches at proper Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces, carried us dry over the whole brca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Meauows, which, I think, is at least a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and it may be justly called a Bridge, on several Accounts, as another at Swarston is called, which is full a M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e in length.</P>
<P>Nottingham, notwithstanding the Na∣vigation of the Trent, is not esteemed a Town of very great Trade, other than as usual to Inland Towns; the chief Ma∣nufacture carried on here is Frame work Knitting for Stockings, the same as at Leicester, and some Glass, and Earthen Ware-houses; the latter much increased since the increase of Tea Drinking; for the making sine Stone Mugs, Tea Pots, Cups, &amp;c. the Glass-Houses, I think, are of late rather decayed.</P>
<P>As there is a fine Market-place, so is there a very good Market, with a vast plenty of Provisions, and those of the best sort, few Towns in England ex∣ceeding it; to say nothing of their Ale, as having reserved it to a Place by it¦self.</P>
<P>As they Brew very good Liquor here, so they make the best Malt, and the most of it any of Town in this Part of Eng∣land, which they drive a great Trade for, sending it by Land-Carriage to Der∣by, through all the Peak as far as Man∣chester, and to other Towns in Lancashire, Cheshire, and even into Yorkshire itself; to which End all the Lower Lands of this County, and especially on the Banks of Trent, yield prodigious Crops of Barley.</P>

The Government of Nottingham is in the Mayor, two Sheriffs, six Aldermen, Coroners and Chamberlains, twenty four Common-Council, whereof six are called Juniors, the rest of course, I suppose, may pass for Seniors.</P>
<P>I might enter into a long Description of all the modern Buildings erected lately in Nottingham, which are considerable, and of some just now going forward. But I have a large Building in the whole to overlook; and I must not dwell too long upon the Threshold.</P>
<P>The Forest of Sherwood is an Additi∣on to Nottingham for the Pleasure of Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and there are also some sine Parks and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Houses in it, as Welbeck, the late Duke of Newcastli's, and Thores∣by, the present noble Seat of the Pierre∣pont's, Dukes of Kingston, which lies at the farthest Edge of the Forest. But this Forest does not add to the Frui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fulness of the County for 'tis now, as it were, gi∣ven up to Waste; even the Woods which formerly made it so famous for Thieves, are wasted; and if there was such a Man as Robin Hood, a famous Out-Law and Deer stealer, that so many Years harbour∣ed here, he would hardly find Shelter for one Week, If he was now to have been there: Nor is there any store of Deer, compared to the Quantity which in for∣mer Times they tell us there usually was.</P>
<P>From Nottingham, a little Mile West on the Road to Derby, we saw Woolla∣ton Hall, the noblest antient-built Palace in this Counry, the Mansion of the anti∣ent Family of Willoughby now Lord Middleton, created Baron in the late Queen Anne's Time. The House, the Gardens, the great Hall, the Monuments of the Family in the Church of Woolla∣ton, and the Pedigree of that Noble Fa∣mily, are well worth a Stranger's View.</P>
<P>The Park, walled in with a new Brlek-Wall, is much finer than the great Park adjoining to the Castle of Nottingham, being much better planted with Timber; whereas that at Nottingham was all cut down, and sequestred in the late Wart.</P>
<P>This House, all of Stone, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Sir Francis Willoughby, second Son <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Honourable—Willoughby <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> slain in the 4th of Edward VI. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Rebellion or Tumult at Norwich, An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1546, and Dame Anne, Daughter of the Marquiss of Dorchester; the full and eldest Son, Sir Thomas Willoughby, dy∣ing unmarried.

The Figure of Building, as an Artist <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f it to me, was rarher Antick than Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt; the Architect is noble, and the Order of Building regular, except the four Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ons of the Dorick on the Top, which they alledge is inexcusable in Architecture. Some, who excuse the Design, will have it to be, that the upper Building is an Ae∣tick, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t on to grace the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But I must be allowed to differ from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Opinion too,</P>

<P>The Monuments of this antient and wealthy Family, for many Years past, are still to be seen at Wolla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on Church. Some of them are very magnificent; and others of them being very antient, are solemn even in their very Ruins.</P>
<P>For Monuments of Men, l ke Men, decay.</P>
<P>Having thus passed the Rubicon (T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent) and set my Face Northward, I scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>new which way to set forward, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country too so full of Wonders, and on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o great a Journey, and yet to leave no∣thing behind me to call on as I came back, at least not to lead me out of my Way in my Return. But then consider¦<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g that I ca l this Work, a Tour▪ and the Parts of it, Letters; I think, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' I shall go a great Length forward, and shall endeavour to take Things with me as I go; yet I may take a Review of some Parts as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came back, and so may be allowed to pick up any Fragments I may have left behind in my going out.</P>
<P>I resolved indeed first for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eak, which lay on my Left hand North East; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, as I say, to leave as little behind me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s possible, I was obliged to make a l ttle Excursion into the Forest, where, in my Way, I had the Diversion of seeing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meeting of the Gentry at the Horse Races near Nottingham. I could give a long and agreeable Account of the Sport it self, how it brought into my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>houghts the Olympick Games among the Greeks; and the Circus Maximus at Rome; where the Racers made a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Victors made great Boasts and Triumphs: But where they chiesly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Chariots, not much unlike our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haises, and where nothing of the Speed, or of Skill in Horsemanship could be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hown, as is in our Races.</P>
<P>It is true, in those Races the young Roman and Grecian Gentlemen rod, or ather drove themselves; whereas in our Races the Horses, not the Riders, make the Show; and they are generally rid∣den by Grooms and Boys, chiefly for lightness; sometimes indeed the Gentle∣men ride themseselves, as I have often seen the Duke of Monmouth, natural Son to King Charles II▪ ride his own Horses at a Match, and win it too, tho' he was a large Man, and must weigh heavy.</P>
<P>But the Illustrious Company at the Not∣tingham Races was, in my Opinion, the Glory of the Day, for there we saw, be∣sides eleven or twelve Noblemen, an in∣si ite Throng of Gentlemen from all the Conatries round, nay, even out of Scot∣land itself; the Appearance, in my Opi∣nion, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as it w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> really m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e nu∣merous, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ever I saw at Newmarket▪ except wh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the King have been there in Ceremony; for I cannot but say, that in King Chales <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Time, wh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Ma∣jesty used to be frequently at Newmarket. I have known the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> there have been with far less Company than this at Nottingham; and, if I might go back to one of these Nottingham Meetings, when the Mare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chal Duke d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was there, I should say, that no Occasions at New∣marker, in my M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mo y, ever came up to it, except the first time that king William was there after the Peace of Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wick.</P>
<P>Nor is the Appearance of the Ladies to be omitted, as fine and without Com∣parison more Bright and Gay, tho' they might a little fall short in Number of the many Thousands of Nobility and Gentry of the other Sex; in short, the Tram of Coaches filled with the Beauties of the North was not to be described; except we were to speak of the Garden of the Tul∣leries at Paris, or the Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>do at Mexico, where they tell us there are 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Coaches with six Horses each, every Evening tak∣ing the Air.</P>
<P>From hence I was going on to see Rugford Abbey, the sine Seat of the late Marquiss of Hallifax, but was called aside to take a View of the most famous piece of Church History in this Part of the
<PB REF="348"/>
whole Island, I mean the Collegiate Church of Southwell.</P>
<P>Paulinus, Archbishop of York, was (so ancient Record supplies the Tale) the Founder of this Church, having preached to the People of the country round, aud babtized them in the River Trent; the antient Word imports chris∣tianized them, by dipping them in the River Trent. Whether our Antipedo-Baptists will take any Advantage of the Word. I know not; but I cannot see any Doubt but that antiently Baptism was performed in the Water; whether it was performed there by Immersion, put∣ting the Person into the Water, or pour∣ing the Water upon him, we know not; neither do I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e any extraordinary, much less any essential Difference in it, be it one way or the other; but that is not my business, especially not here: The reason of naming it, is to give you the pious Occasion which made the good Bishop build this Church, namely, that having converted a whole Province, or Part of one at least, he was desirous they should not want a Place of Worship to serve God in.</P>
<P>The Thing which makes this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the more remarkable, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it was surrendered into the King' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with all the rest of the religious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Reign of King Henry VIII. yet it was restored wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it was before, in the 35th of the sane Reign.</P>
<P>But because I love to speak not from my self in Cases where good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are to be had, and that in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> View of a Place, such as that of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be, the Outsides or Appearan es of Things only are to be seen, or such farther Knowledge as may be obtained by report of inhabitants; for I copy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thing from Books, but where I qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Books, and refer to them; I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r this Reason I give you an Account of this venerable Pile, its Foundation and present Constitution, from a Rever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d and very good Friend, and one of the present Prebendaries of the Place, and whose Authority I do, and the Reader may depend upon, as follows, viz.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>TOWN</HI> and <HI>CHURCH</HI> of <HI>SOUTHWELL</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOUTHWELL, in the County of Nottingham, is about nine Miles North East from Nottingham, four Miles West from Newark, eight South East from Mansfield, and about two South West the River Trent. The soil of it rich Clay and Marle; the Air very good, and well watered; the River Greet runs by it. It is a Market Town, and the Market Day Saturday; it is remarkable for no sort of Manufacture.</P>
<P>There is in it but one Church, which is both Parochial and Collegiate; which, I think, is the case of no other in Eng∣land, except Rippon in Yorkshire.</P>
<P>The Parish consists of Southwell, and the Hamlets of Eastrope, which joins to Southwell on the East; Westrope, about a quarter of a Mile West of South∣well; and Normanton, about a Mile North; it contains about 350 Families. There is a Parish-Vicar so called, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is generally one of the Vicars <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whose business it is to visit the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bury the Death, &amp;c. the Preaching <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being performed by the Prebendaries. This Vicarage was lately augmented by Q Annc's Bounty, which Benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell to it by Lot.</P>
<P>The Collegiate Church consists <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prebendaries or Canons, 6 Vicars Cho∣ral, an Organist, 6 Singing-Men, 6 Cho∣risters, a Register to the Chapter, a Trea∣surer, an Auditor, a Verger, &amp;c. The Prebends are all in the Gift of the A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣bishop of Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. All the rest of the Members disposed of by the Chap∣ter.</P>
<P>The Foundation of this church <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doubtless very antient. It is generally

<P>The Fabrick of the Church is at pre∣sent in good and decent Order. It is a strong Building of the Gothick Order, very plain. I remember to have met with this Passage in some of our old Writings; That when the Dispute was about the Dissolution of the Church, I think in King James's Reign; among other Things, it was urged by the Chapter, that the Church of Southwell was a plain Fabrick, free from all superstitious Ornaments; that there were no painted Figures in the Glass-Work, nor Images, nor so much as a Nitch capable of placing an Image in; which I think is true. And from hence too it has been conjectur'd concerning
<PB REF="351"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Antiquity of this Church, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>robably built, before Image-Worship was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ractised or thought of in the Christian Church.</P>
<P>This Church was a great Part of it burnt down in the Year 1711 by Light∣ning; of which I find this Memorandum in one of our Books, viz. On Monday the 5th of November, 1711▪ about Ten o'Clock at Night, the Top of the Ball on one of the South Spires of this Collegiate Church of Southwell was fired by Light∣ning; which, backed by a furious Wind that drove it almost directly on the Body of the Church, in a few Hours burnt down the Spire and Roof, melted down the Bells, and spared nothing that was combustible, except the other Spire, till it came to the Quire, where, after it had consumed the Orgains, it was by singular Providence stopt and extinguish'd</P>
<P>This is a pretty exact Account; to which I must add, that the Damage was computed at near 4000 l. which great M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fortune was happily repaired by the In∣dustry of the Chapter, joined with the help of the then Archbishop of York, Dr. Sharp; who not only contributed largely themselves, but by their Solicita∣tions obtained a Brief, which, with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ral Contributions of several of the Nobility and Gentry, and the Inhabitants of Southwell and its Neighbourhood, en∣abled them to repair the Church, and to put it in as good Order as it was before the Fire,</P>
<P>Among the Benefactors ought particu∣larly to be remembered with Gratitude the late Dutchess Dowager of Newcastle, who, at the Intercession of the Arch∣bishop, kindly seconded by her Chaplain Dr. Brailsford, now Dean of Wells, l.</P>

Esq; who
<PB REF="353"/>
was his Nephew and Heir, inherited it, with the Bulk of all the rest of his E∣state, and who now enjoys it by a Lease of three Lives, granted by the late Arch∣bishop Sir William Dawes. Here were no less than three Parks belonging to the Archbishop, which tho' disparked, still retain the Name; one of which is Norwood Park, in which is a good House, which has been very much enlarged and b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tified by the said Mr. Burton, who lives in it some part of the Year.</P>
<P>There is a Free-School adjoining to the Church, under the care of the Chap∣ter; where the Choristers are taught <HI>gratis;</HI> and other Boys belonging to the Town. The Master is chosen by the Chapter; and is to be approved by the Archbishop of York.</P>
<P>There are also two Fellowships and two Scholarships in St. John's College is Cambridge, founded by Dr. Keton, Canon of Salisbury, in the 22d Year of King Henry VIII. to be chosen by the Master and Fellows of the said College, out of such who have been Choristers of the Church of Southwell, if any such able Person for Learning and Manners, can be found in Southwell, or in the University of Cambridge; and for want of such, then out of any Scholars abid∣ing in Cambridge; which said Fellow∣ships are to be Thirteen Shillings and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our-pence each better than any other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellowship of the College.</P>
<P>Hence crossing the Forest I came to Mansfield, a Market Town, but with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut any Remarkables In my Way I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isited the noble Seat of the Duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wcastle at Walbeck, and the Marquiss <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hallifax at Rufford, or Rugeford Ab∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, all very noble Seats, tho' ancient, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that at Welbeck especially, beauti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with large Additions, fine Apart∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents, and good Gardens; but particu∣larly the Park, well stocked with large Timber, and the finest Kind, as well as the largest Quantity of Deer that are any where to be seen; for the late Duke's Delight being chiefly on Horseback and in the Chace, it is not to be wondered if he rather made his Parks fine than his Gardens, and his Stables than his Man∣sion-House; yet the House is noble, large, and magnificent.</P>
<P>Hard by Welbeck is Wirksop Mannor, the antient and stately Seat of the no∣ble Family of Talbot, descended by a long Line of Ancestors from another Family Illustrious, though not enobled (of Love<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s.) This House, (tho' in its ancient Figure) is outdone by none of the best and greatest in the County, except Wollaton Hall, already mention∣ed; and that though it is, as it were, deserted of its noble Patrons; the Fami∣ly of Shrewsbury being in the Person of the last Duke, removed from this side of the Country to another fine Seat in the West, already mentioned.</P>
<P>From hence leaving Nottinghamshire, the West Part abounding with Lead and Coal, I cross'd over that Fury of a Ri∣ver called the Derwent, and came to Derby, the Capital of the County. This is a fine, beautiful, and pleasant Town; it has more Families of Gentlemen in it than is usual in Towns so remote and therefore here is a great deal of good, and some gay Company: Perhaps the ra∣ther, because the Peak being so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, and taking up the larger Part of the County, and being so inhospitable, so rugged and so wild a Place, the Gentry choose to reside at Derby, rather than upon their Estates, as they do in other places.</P>
<P><PB REF="354"/>
It must be allowed, that the twelve Miles between Nottingham and this Town, keeping the mid-way between the Trent on the Left, and the Mountains on the Right, are as agreeable with respect to the Situation, the Soil, and the well plant∣ing of the Country, as any Spot of Ground, at least that I have seen of that Length, in England.</P>
<P>The Town of Derby is situated on the West Bank of the Derwent, over which it has a very fine Bridge, well built, but antient, and a Chapel upon the Bridge, now converted into a Dwelling-House. Here is a Curiosity in Trade worth ob∣serving, as being the only one of its Kind in England, namely, a Throwing or Throwster's Mill, which performs by a Wheel turn'd by the Water; and though it cannot perform the Doubling Part of a Throwster's Work, which can only be done by a Hand-wheel, yet it turns the other Work, and performs the Labour of many Hands. Whether it answers the Expence or not, that is not my Busi∣ness.</P>
<P>This Work was erected by one Soracole, a Man expert in making Mill-Work, es∣pecially for raising Water to supply Towns for Family Use: But he made a very odd Experiment at this Place; for going to shew some Gentlemen the Curiosity, as he called it, of his Mill and crossing the Planks which lay just above the Mill-Wheel; regarding, it seems, what he was to shew his Friends more than the Place where he was, and too eager in describ∣ing Things, keeping his Eye rather up∣on what he pointed at with his Fingers, than what he stept upon with his Feet, he stepp'd away and slipt into the River.</P>
<P>He was so very close to the Sluice which let the Water out upon the Wheel, and which was then pulled up, that tho' Help was just at hand, there was no tak∣ing hold of him, till by the Force of the Water he was carried through, and push¦ed just under the large Wheel, which was then going round at a great Rate. The Body being thus forc'd in between two of the Plashers of the Wheel, stopt the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion for a little while, till the Water pushing hard to force its Way, the Plash∣er beyond him gave way and broke; up∣on which the Wheel went again, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> like Jonah's Whale, spewed him out, not upon dry Land but into that Part they call the Apron, and so to the Mill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, where he was taken up, and received <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hurt at all.</P>
<P>Derby, as I have said, is a Town of Gentry, rather than Trade; yet it is po∣pulous, well built, has five Parishes, a large Market place, a fine Town-House, and very handsome Streets.</P>
<P>In the Church of Allhallows, or, as the Spaniards call it, De Todos los <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, All Saints, is the Pantheon, or Burial-Place of the noble, now Ducal Family of Cavendish, now Devonshire, which was first erected by the Countess of Shrews∣bury, who not only built the Vault o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sepulchre, but an Hospital for eight <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men and four Women, close by the Church, and settled their mainte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, which is continued to this Day: Here are very magnificent monuments for the Fa∣mily of Cavendish; and at this Church is a famous Tower or Steeple, which for the Heighth and beauty of its Building, is not equalled in this county, or in any of those adjacent.</P>
<P>By an Inscription upon this Church, it was erected, or at least the Steeple, at the charge of the Maids and Batchelors of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town; on which Account, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ever▪ Maid, Native of the Town, was marry'd▪ the Bells were Rung by batchelors: H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long the custom lasted, we do not read, but I do not find that it is continued, at least not sttictly.</P>

<P>In our Way we past an antient Seat, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but not very gay, of Sir Nathaniel <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a noted and (for Wealth) over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at Family, for many Ages Inhabitants <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this County. Hence we kept the Der∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent on our Right-hand, but kept our Distance, the Waters being out; for the Derwent is a frightful Creature when the Hills load her Current with Water; I say, we kept our Distance, and contented our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves with hearing the roaring of its Wa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, till we came to Quarn or Quarden, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little ragged, but noted Village, where there is a famous Chalybeat Spring, to which abundance of People go in the Sea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to drink the Water, as also a Cold Bath. There are also several other Mi∣neral Waters in this Part of the Country<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as another Chalybeat near Quarden or Quarn, a hot Bath at Matlock, and ano∣ther at Buxton, of which in its Place; be∣sides these, there are hot Springs in several Places which run waste into the Ditches and Brooks, and are taken no ontice of, being remote among the Mountains, and out of the Way of the common resort.</P>
<P>We found the Wells, as Custom bids us call them, pretty full of Company, the Waters good, and very physical, but wretched Lodging and Entertainment; so I resolved to stay till I came to the South, and make shift with Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bridge or Epsom, of which I have spoken at large in the Counties of Surrey and Kent.</P>
<P>From Quarden we advanced due North, and, mounting the Hills gradually for four or five Miles, we soon had a most frightful View indeed among the black Mountains of the Peak; however, as they were yet at a Distance, and a good Town lay on our Left called Wirksworth, we turned thither for Refreshment; Here indeed we found a Specimen of what I had heard before, (viz.) that however rugged the Hills were, the Vales were every where fruitful, well inhabited, the Markets well supplied, and the Provisions extraordinary good; not forgetting the Ale, which every where exceeded, if pos∣sible, what was pass'd, as if the farther North the better the Liquor, and that the nearer we approach'd to Yorkshire, as the Place for the best, so the Ale advanc'd the nearer to its Perfection.</P>
<P>Wirksworth is a large well-frequented Market Town, and Market Towns be∣ing very thin placed in this Part of the Country, they have the better Trade, the People generally coming twelve or fifteen Miles to a Market, and sometimes much more; though there is no very great Trade to this Town but what relaies to the Lead Works, and to the subterranean Wretches, who they call Peakrills, who work in the Mines, and who live all round this Town every way.</P>
<P><PB REF="356"/>
The inhabitants are a rude boorish kind of People, but they are a bold, daring, and even desperate kind of Fel∣lows in their search into the Bowels of the Earth; for no People in the World out-do them; and therefore they are of∣ten entertained by our Engineers in the Wars to carry on the Sap, and other such Works, at the Sieges of strong fortified Places.</P>
<P>This Town of Wirksworth is a kind of a Market for Lead; the like not known any where else that I know of, except it be at the Custom-house Keys in London. The Barmoot-Court, kept here to judge Controversies among the Miners, that is to say, to adjust subterranean Quarrels and Disputes, is very remarkable: Here they summon a Master and twenty-four Jurors, and they have Power to set out the Bounds of the Works under Ground, the Terms are these, they are empow∣ered to set off the Meers (so they call them) of Ground in a Pipe and a Flat, that is to say, twenty-nine Yards long in the first, and fourteen Square in the last; when any Man has found a Vein of Oar in another Man's Ground, except Orchards and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> point the Proprietor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for Timber, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> prescribes Rules to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Proceedings <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> under Ground; also they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all their little Quarrel▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Mines as well as ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> keeps the Peace among <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by the way, may be called he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of all the Wonders of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are of a strange, turbulent, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> temper, and very hard to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to one another in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fairs.</P>

The prodigi∣ous heighth of this Tor, (for it is called Matlock Tor) was to me more a won∣der than any of the rest in the Peak, and, I think▪ it should be named among them, but it is not So it must not be called one o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wonders.</P>
<P>A little on the other side of Wirks∣worth, begins a long Plain called Bras∣sington Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, which reaches full twelve miles in length another way, viz. from Brassington to Buxton. At the beginning of it on this side from Wirksworth, it is not quite so much. The Peak Peo∣ple, who are mighty fond of having Stran∣gers shewed every Thing they can, and of calling every thing a wonder, told us here of another high mountain, where a Grant was buried, and which they called the Giant's Tomb.</P>
<P>This tempted our Curiosity, and we presently rod up to the mountain in or∣der to leave our Hors<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Dragoon li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, with a Servant, and to clamber up to the Top of it, to see this Giant's Tomb: Here we miss'd the imaginary wonder, and found a real one; the story of which I cannot but record, to shew the discon∣tented Part of the rich World how to value their own Happiness, by looking below them, and seeing how others live, who yet are capable of being easie and content, which content goes a great way towards being happy, if it does not come quite up to Happiness. The story is this:</P>
<P>As we came near the Hill, which seem∣ed to be round, and a Precipice almost on every Side, we perceived a little parcel of Ground hedg'd in, as if it were a Garden, it was about twenty or thirty Yards lorg, but not so much broad. Parallel with the Hill, and close to it; we saw no House, but, by a Dog running out barking, we perceived some People were thereabout;
<PB REF="358"/>
and presently after we saw two little Children, and then a third run out to see what was the Matter. When we came close up we saw a small opening, not a Door, but a natural opening into the Rock, and the Noise we had made brought a Woman out with a Child in her Arms, and another at her Foot. N. B. The big∣gest of these five was a Girl, about eight or ten Years old.</P>
<P>We asked the Woman some Questions about the Tomb of the Giant upon the Rock or Mountain, She told us, there was a broad flat Stone of a great size lay there, which, she said, the People call'd a Gravestone; and, if it was, it might well be called a Giant's, for she thought no ordinary Man was ever so tall, and she describ'd it to us as well as she could, by which it must be at least sixteen or seven∣teen Foot long; but she could not give any farther Account of it, neither did she seem to lay any Stress upon the Tale of a Giant being buried there, but said, if her Husband had been at home he might have shown it to us. I snatch'd at the Word, at home! says I, good Wife, why, where do you live. Here, Sir, says she, and points to the Hole in the Rock. Here! says I; and do all these Children live here too? Yes, Sir, says she, they were all born here. Pray how long have you dwelt here then? said I. My Husband was born here, said she, and his Father before him. Will you give me leave, says one of our Company, as cu∣rious as I was, to come in and see your House, Dame? If you please, Sir, says she, but 'tis not a Place sit for such as you are to come into, calling him, your Wor∣ship, forsooth; but that by the by. I mention it, to shew that the good Woman did not want Manners, though she liv'd in a Den like a wild Body.</P>
<P>However, we alighted and went in: There was a large hallow Cave, which the poor People by two Curtains hang'd cross, had parted into three Room. On one Side was the Chimney, and the Man, or perhaps his Father, being Miners, had found means to work a Shaft or Funnel through the Rock to carry the Smoke <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the Top, where the Giant's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was. The Habitation was poor, 'tis true, but Things within did not look <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o like Misery as I expected. Every T ing was clean and neat, tho' mean and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> There were Shelves with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and some Pewter and Brass. There was, which I observed in particular, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Flitch or Side of Bacon hanging up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Chimney, and by it a good Piece o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> There was a Sow and Pigs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about at the Door, and a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> feeding upon a green Place just <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Door, and the little enclosed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Ground I mentioned, was growing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Barley; it being then near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>To find out whence this appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Substance came, I asked the poor Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> what Trade her Husband was?

<P>This moving Sight so affected us all, that, upon a short Conference at the Door, we made up a little Lump of Money, and I had the honour to be Almoner for the Company; and though the Sum was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great, being at most something <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Crown, as I told it into the poor Woman's Hand, I could perceive such a S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>prize in her Face, that, had she not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to her Joy by a sudden flux of Years, I found she would have fainted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> She was some time before she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> do any thing but Cry, but after that was abated, she expressed her self ve∣ry handsomely (for a poor Body) and t ld me, she had not seen so much Money t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gether of her own for many Months.</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom hence enquiring no farther after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e G ant, or his Tomb, we went, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e due <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the poor woman, to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ley on the side of a rising Hill, where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e were several Grooves, so they call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mouth of the shaft or pit by which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey go down into a Lead Mine; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we were standing still to look at one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them▪ admiring how small they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earce believing a poor Man that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it us, when he told us, that they went wn those narrow Pits or Holes to so great a Depth in the Earth; I say, while we were wondering, and scarce believing the Fact, we were agreeably surprized with seeing a Hand, and then an Arm, and quickly after a Head, thrust up out of the very Groove we were looking at. It was the more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urprizing as not we on∣ly▪ but not the Man that we were talk∣ing to, knew any thing of it, or expec∣ted it.</P>
<P>Immediately we rode closer up to the Place, where we see <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he poor Wretch working and heaving himself up gradual∣ly, as we thought, with difficuly; but when he shewed us that it was by set∣ting his Feet upon Pleces of Wood sixt cross the Angles of the Groove like a Ladder, we found that the Difficulty was not much; and if the Groove had been larger they could not either go up or down so easily, or with so much safety, for that now their Elbows resting on those Pieces as well as their Feet, they went up and down with great Ease and Safety.</P>
<P>Those who would have a more perfect Idea of those Grooves, need do no more than go to the Church of St. Paul's, and desire to see the square Wells which they have there to go down from the Top of the Church into the very Vaults under it, to place the Leaden Pipes which car∣ry the Rain Water from the flat of the Roof to the Common shore, which Wells are square, and have small Iron Bats placed cross the Angles for the Workmen to set their Feet on, to go up and down to repair the Pipes.</P>
<P>When this subterranean Creature was come out, with all his Furniture about him, we had as much Variety to take us up as before, and our Curiosity received full Satisfaction without venturing down, as we were persuaded to by some People, and as two of our Company were in∣clined to do.</P>

<PB REF="360"/>
Names of which we could understand but by the help of an Interpreter. Nor indeed could we understand any of the Man's Discourse so as to make outth whole Sentence; and yet the Man was pretty free of his Tongue.</P>
<P>For his Person, he was lean as a skele∣ton, pale as dead corps, his hair and beard a deep black, his flesh lank, and, as we thought, something of the Co∣lour of the Lead itself, and being very tall and very lean he look'd, or we that saw him ascend <HI>ab Inferis,</HI> fancied he look'd like an Inhabitant of the dark Regions below, and who was just ascend∣ed into the world of Light.</P>
<P>Besides his Basket of Tools, he brought up with him about three quarters of a hundred weight of Oar, which we won∣dered at, for the Man had no small Load to bring, considering the manner of his coming up; and this indeed made him come heaving and struggling up, as I said at first, as if he had great Difficulty to get out; whereas it was indeed the weight that he brought with him.</P>
<P>If any Reader thinks this, and the past relation of the Woman and the Cave, too low and trifling so this work, they must be told, that I think quite other∣wise; aud especially considering what a Noise is made of Wonders in this coun∣try, which, I must needs say, have no∣thing in them curious, but much talked of, more trifling a great deal. See <HI>Cot∣ton</HI>'s <HI>Wonders of the Peak, Hobbes</HI>'s <HI>Chatsworth,</HI> and several others; but I shall make no more Apologies. I return to our subterranean Apparition.</P>
<P>We asked him, how deep the Mine lay which he came out of: He answered us in Terms as we did not understand; but our Interpreter, as above, told us, it signified that he was at work 60 Fa∣thoms deep, but that there were five men of his Party, who were, two of them, eleven Fathoms, and the other three fifteen Fathoms deeper: He seem∣ed to regret that he was not at work with those three; for that they had a deeper Vein of Oar than that which he worked in, and had a way out at the side of the Hill, where they pass'd with∣out coming up so high as he was oblig'd to do.</P>
<P>If we blessed out selves before, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we saw how the poor Woman and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> five Children lived in the Hole <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the mountain, with the Giant's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over their Heads; we had much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> room to reflect how much we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acknowledge to our Maker, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were not appointed to get <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thus, one hundred and fifty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ground▪ or in a Hole as d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earth as the Cross upon St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> polo is high out of it: Nor was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to see these miserable People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such Reflections, unless <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> suppose a Man as stupid and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Horse he Rides on.

<P>That which was more wonderful to me than all of it, was, that so light is made of them as to Use; that the Peo∣ple rather wonder at them than take the Benefit of them; and that, as there are several hot Springs in this Village of Bux∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, as well as Matlock, mentioned a∣bove, and at several other Places, they are not bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt into noble and convenient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athing Places; and, instead of a House <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a City built here for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of Company; which, if it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e given to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the Baths at Bath, I doubt not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be as well frequented, and to as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Purpose.</P>
<P>But though I shall not treat this warm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Wonder, for such it is not; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> give it the Praise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Virtue of its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is not to be deny'd, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cures have been wrought by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> especially in Rhematick, Scorbu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and scropulous Distempers, Aches of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Joints, nervous Pains, and also in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly and lepoous Maladies.</P>

<P>These Waters (Buxton) if drank, create a good Appotre, open Obstructi∣ons, and no doubt, if mixed with the Chylybeat Waters that are there also, may answer all the intentions of the Bath Water in Some<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tshire, and that of Sir Vincent's too at Bristol, so noted for curing the <HI>Diabetes;</HI> of which I have several Instances in these Parts; and likewise for curing of Bloody Urines, of which I saw a most noted Instance at Li∣verpool.</P>
<P>This Bath is of a temperate Heat, and without question, by a reverberat∣ing <HI>Halitus</HI> might be brought to any Degree of Heat; but, I think, in its own natural Heat, it may in general be said to be more agreeable to the Constitu∣tions of those Parts; and where the hot Baths cannot be safely used, this may This last Summer I saw remarkable In∣stances of its Effects in scorbutick Rheu∣ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ms in Persons, that could not go before without the help of Crutches, who came from thence to Manchester on foot without them, distant from Buxton full sixteen Northern Miles.</P>
<P>For the Antiquiry of these Baths too, though there is not a King Bladud to teslity for them, as a Bath in Somer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>shire, whose Evidence we cannot be be sure is very justisiable, yet hear the same Author on that Article:</P>

That these Baths were eminent in the Romans time, is most certain. Lucan, and others acquaint us, they were extra∣ordinary hot, the High Road, called the Roman Bath Gate, as Mr. Cambden says, further confirms it; but it is especially evident from a Roman Wall cemeuted with red Roman Plaister, close by St. Anne's Well, where we may see the ruins of the antient Bath, its Dimensions and Length.</P>
<P>The Waters are temperately hot, or ra∣ther warm, and operate rather as a cold Bath, without that violent Attack which the cold Bath makes upon all Nature at once: you feel a little Chilness when you first dip or plunge into the Water, but it is gone in a Moment; and you find a kind of an equality in the warmth of your Blood and that of the Water, and that so very pleasant, that far from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and weakening Violence of the hot Baths, which makes you ready to die away if you continue above an Hour, or thereabouts, in them, and will shrivel up the Fingers like those of Women, who have been washing Cloaths; on the con∣trary, here you are never tired, and can hardly be persuaded to come out of the Bath when you are in.</P>
<P>The Village where the principal Springs are, is called Buxton; though there are several of them, for they rise unregarded in the Banks of the Enclosures, and on the Sides of the Hill, so that the Num∣ber is hardly known; there is but one Bath which is walled in with Stone Walls, and Steps made to go down into it, and a House built over it, though not so close as is fit for Winter bathing.</P>
<P>The Duke of Devonshire is Lord of the Village, and consequently of the Bath itself; and his Grace has built a large handsome House at the Bath, where there is convenient Lodging, and very good Provisions, and an Ordinary well served for One Shilling per Head<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ but it is but one. And though some other Houses in the Town take in Lodgers upon occasion, yet the Conveniencies are not the same; so that there is not Accommodation for a Confluence of People, as at the Bath.

<P>South West from hence, about a quar∣ter of a Mile, or not so much on the Side, or rather at the Foot of a very high Ridge of Mountains, is a great Cave or Hole in the Earth, called Poole's Hole, another of the Wonderless Wonders of the Peak. The Wit that has been spent upon this Vault or Cave in the Earth, had been well enough to raise the expectation of Strangers, and bring Fools a great way to creep into it; but is ill bestowed upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those that come to the Place with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Curiosity, founded upon antient Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt; when these go in to see it, they ge∣nerally go away, acknowledging that they have seen nothing suitable to their great Expectation, or to the Fame of the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace.</P>
<P>It is a great Cave▪ or natural Vault, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient doubtless as the Mountain itself, and occasioned by the fortuitous Position of the Rocks at the creation of all Things, or perhaps at the great Absorpti∣on or Influx of the Surface into the Abyss at the great Rupture of the Earth's Crust or Shell, according to Mr. Burnet's The∣ory, and to me it seems a Confirmation of that Hypotheses of the breaking in of the Surface. But that by the way:</P>
<P>It may be deepen'd and enlarged by Streams and Eruptions of subterraneous Waters, of which here are several, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> generally are in all such Cavities; as at Castleton in this Country, at Wooky <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Somersetshire, which I have al∣ready spoken of; and at several like Caves which are now to be seen among the Mountains in Swisserland, in Norway, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hungary, and other Places.</P>

<P>The utmost you meet with after this, is the extraordinary heighth of the Arch or Roof; however, is far from what a late flaming Author has magnified it to, (viz) a quarter of a Mile perpendicular.

<P>Dr. Leigh spends some time in admir∣ing the spangled Roof. Cotton and Hob∣bes are most ridiculously and outrageously witty upon it. Dr. Leigh calls it Fret Work, Organ, and Choir Work. The whole of the Matter is this, that the Rock being every where moist and drop∣ping, the Drops are some fallen, those you see below; some falling, those you have glancing by you En passant; and others pendant in the Roof. Now as you have Guides before you and behind you, carrying every one a Candle, the light of the Candles reflected by the globular drops of Water, dazle upon your Eyes from every Corner; like as the drops of Dew in a sunny bright Morning reflect the rising Light to the Eye, and are as ten thousand Rainbows in miniature; where∣as were any Part of the Roof or Arch of this Vault to be seen by a clear Light, there would be no more Beauty on it than on the Back of a Chimney; for, in short, the Stone is course, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imy, with the con∣stant wet, dirty and dull; and were the little drops of Water gone, or the Can∣dles gone, there would be none of these sine Sights to be seen for Wonders▪ or for the learned Authors above to show themselves foolish about.</P>
<P>Let any Person therefore, who goes into Poole's Hole for the future, and has
<PB REF="364"/>
a mind to try the Experiment, take a long Pole in his Hand, with a Cloth tied to the end of it, and mark any Place of the shining spangled Roof which his Pole will reach to; and then, wip∣ing the drops of Water away, he shall see he will at once extinguish all those Glories; then let him sit still and wait a little, till, by the Nature of the Thing, the Drops sweil out again, and he shall find the Stars and Spangles rise again, by Degrees here one, and there one, till they shine with the same Fraud, a meer <HI>deceptio visus,</HI> as they did before. As for the Queen of Scots Pillar, as 'tis cal'ed, because her late unfortunate Majesty, Mary Queen of Scots, was pleased to have it be called so, it is a Piece of Stone like a kind of Spar, which is found about the Lead; and 'tis not improbable in a Country where there is so much of the Oar, it may be of the same kind, and, standing upright, obtained the Name of a Pillar; of which almost every Body that comes there, carries away a Piece, in Veneration of the Memory of the unhappy Princess that gave it her Name. Nor is there any thing strange or unusual in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, much less in the Figure of it, which is otherwise very mean, and in that Country very common.</P>
<P>As to the several Stones called Mr. Cotton's Haycock's, Poole's Chair, Flitch∣es of Bacon, and the like, they are no∣thing but ordinary Stones; and the Shape very little resemble the Things they are said to represent; but the fruitful Imagination of the Country Carls, who fancy to call them so, will have them to look like them; a Stranger sees very little even of the Similitude, any more than when People fancy they see Faces and Heads, Castles and Cities, Armies, Horses and Men, in the Clouds, in the Fire▪ and the like.</P>
<P>Nor is the petrifying of the Water, which appears in its pendant form like Iceles in the Roof aloft, or rising Pyra∣mids below, if such there were, any thing but what is frequent and natural both to Water and to Stone, placed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Ground, and seems to be the way by which even Stone itself, like other Vegetables fructifies and grows.</P>
<P>So that, in short, there is nothing in Poole's Hole to make a Wonder of, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y more than as other Things in Nature, which are rare to be seen, however <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣sily accounted for, may be called won∣derful.</P>
<P>Having thus accounted for two of the seven Things, called Wonders in thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country, I pass by Elden Hole▪ which I shall take notice of by it self, and come to two more of them, as wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and empty of every Thing that may be called rare of strange, as the other; and indeed much more so.</P>
<P>The first of these is Mam <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the Word in the Mountain Jargon, sig∣nifies, the Mother Rock, upon a Sug∣gestion that the soft crumbling Earth, which falls from the Summit of the one, breeds or begets several Mountains be∣low. The Sum of the whole Wonder is this, That there is a very high Hill, nay, I will add (that I may make the most of the Story, and that it may ap∣pear as much like a Wonder as I can) an exceeding high Hill. But this in a Country which is all over Hills, can∣not be much of a Wonder because al∣so there are several higher Hills in the Peak than that, only not just the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P>The South Side of this Hill is a Pre∣cipice, and very steep from the Top to the Bottom; and as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Hill is not a solid S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as is the Case of all the Hills therea∣bouts, but a cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbling loose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣gled with small Stones, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> falling down in small <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the force of hasty Shower, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lid hea∣vy Rains, loosen▪ and washes it off, or as Frosts and Thaws operate upon it in common with other Parts of the Earth▪ now as the great Hill, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well as high, parts with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Stuff, without being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB REF="365"/>
yet the bottom which it falls into, is more easily perceived to swell with the Quantity that falls down; the space where it is received being small, comparatively to the heighth and thickness of the moun∣tain: Here the pretended Wonder is form'd, namely, that the little Heap be∣low, should grow up into a Hill, and yet the great Hill not be the less for all that is fallen down; which is not true in fact, any more than, as a great black Cloud pouring down Rain as it passes over our Heads, appears still as great and as black as before, though it continues pouring down Rain over all the Country. But nothing is more certain than this, that the more Water comes down from it, the less remains in it; and so it certainly is of Mam Tor, in spite of all the Po∣etry of Mr. Cotton or Mr. Hobbes, and in spight of all the Women's Tales in the Peak.</P>
<P>This Hill lies on the North side of the Road from Buxton to Castleton, where we come to the so famed Wonder call'd, saving our good Manners, <HI>The Devil's A—e in the Peak:</HI> Now notwith∣standing the grossness of the Name gi∣ven it, and that there is nothing of si∣militude coherence either in Form and Figure, or any other thing signified and the thing signifying; yet we must search narrowly for any thing in it to make a Wonder, or even any thing so strange▪ or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or vulgar, as the Name would seem to import.</P>
<P>The short of this Story is; that on the steep side of a Mountain; there is a large opening very high, broad at bot∣tom, and narrow, but rounding, on the top, almost the Form of the old Gothick Gates or Archs, which come up, not to a half Circle or half Oval at the top, but to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oint; though this being all wild and irregular, cannot be said to be an Arch, but a meer Chasme, entring ho∣rizontally; the opening being upwards of thirty Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t perpendicular, and twice as m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h broad at the bottom at least.</P>
<P>The Arch continues thus wide but a little way; yet far enough to have seve∣veral small Cottages built on either side of it within the Entrance; so that 'tis like a little Town in a Vault: In the middle, ▪as it were a Street) is a run∣ning stream of Water; the poetical De∣scriptions of it will have this be called a River, tho' they have not yet bestow'd a Name upon it, nor indeed is it worthy a Name.</P>
<P>As you go on, the Roof descends gradually, and is so far from admitting Houses to stand in it, that you have not leave to stand upright your self, till stoop∣ing for a little way, and passing over another Rill of Water, which Mr. Cot∣ton calls a River, you find more Room over your Head. But going a little far∣ther you come to a third Water, which crosses your way; and the Rock stoop∣ing, as it were, down almost to the surface of the Water, forbids any farther Enquiry into what is beyond.</P>
<P>This is the whole Wonder, unless it may be called so, that our Ancestors should give it so homely a Sirname; and give us no Reason for it, but what we must guess at from the uncouth entrance of the Place, which being no guide in the Case, leave us to reflect a little upon their Modesty of Expression; but it seems they talked broader in those Days than we do now.</P>
<P>To conclude: If there were no such Vaults and Arches any where but in the Peak, or indeed if they were not frequent in such mountainous Countries, as well here, as in othe' other Nations we might call this a Wonder. But as we know they are to be found in many Places of England, and that we read of them in the Description of other Countries, and even in the Scripture, we cannot think there is any room to call it a Wonder. We read of the Cave of Adullam, and of the Cave of Mackp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lah, in the Scrip∣ture, able to receive David, and his whole Troop of four hundred Men. We read
<PB REF="366"/>
of the persecuted Worthies in the 12th of the Hebrews, who wandered about in Dens and Caves of the Earth. We read of a Cave in the Apenine Mountains near to Florence, which was able to re∣ceive an Army; there are also many such Caves, as I have observed above, in the Alpes, and the Hills of Dauphine and Sa∣voy, and in other Parts of the World, too many to run over; and some of them, such as this is not worthy to be named among them.</P>
<P>Indeed, had Gervaise of Tilbury been credited, this Place had deserved all that Wonder cou'd ascribe to it; for he tells us of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shepherd who, having ventured into the third River in this Den, and be∣ing either carried over it or down the Stream, he knew not whether, saw a beautiful heavenly Country beyond it, with a spacious Plain watered with many clear Rivers and pleasant Brooks, and se¦veral Lakes of standing Water. But who this Shepherd was, how he got into that pleasant Country, and, above all, how he came back to tell the Story our Friend Gervaise forgot, it seems, to take any notice of; and so the Tale is broken off before it was half told▪ like another of the same kind which Hudibras tells of,
<Q><L>Which, like the Tale o'th' Bear and Fid∣dle,</L>
<L>Was told; but broke off in the middle.</L></Q></P>
<P>The next Wonder, which makes up Number five, is called Tideswell, or a Spring of Water which ebbs and flows, as they will have it, as the Sea does. A poor thing indeed to make a Wonder of; and therefore most of the Writers pass it over with little notice; only that they are at a loss to make up the Number seven without it.</P>
<P>This Well or Spring is called Weeden Well; the Basin or Receiver for the Wa∣ter is about three Foot qusare every way; the Water seems to have some other Re∣ceiver within the Rock, which, when it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills by the force of the original Stream, which is small, the Air being contracted or pent in, forces the Water out with a bubbling Noise, and so fills the Receiver without; but when the Force is spent within, then it stops till the Place is fil∣led again; and, in the mean time, the Water without runs off or ebbs, till the Quantity within swells again, and then the same Causes produce the same Effects, as will always be while the World en∣dures. So that all this Wonder is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only to the Situation of the Place, which is a meer Accident in Nature; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Person were to dig into the Place, and give vent to the Air, which fills the con∣tracted Space within, they would soon see Tideswell turned into an ordinary running Stream, and a very little on too.</P>
<P>So much for fictitious Wonders, or in∣deed simple Wonders. The two real Wonders which remain, are first, Elden Hole, and secondly, the Duke of Devon∣shire's fine House at Chatsworth; one a Wonder of Nature, the other of Art. I begin with the last.</P>
<P>Chatsworth is indeed a most glorious and magnificent House, and, as it has had two or three Founders, may well be said to be compl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atly designed and finish∣ed. It was begun on a much narrower Plan than it now takes up, by Sir Wil∣liam Cavendish, of Cavendish in Suffolk, who married the Countess Dowager <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shrewsbury, and with her came into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> noble and plentiful Fortune in this Coun∣try.</P>
<P>Sir William died, having done little more than built one end of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and laid out the Plan, as I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Ichnography of the whole. But the La∣dy, who, it seems, was the mover of the first Design, finish'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole in the magnificent Manner which it appeared i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when it was first christen▪d a Wonder, and ranked among the Marvellous of the Peak. But what would the World have called it, or what would Mr. Cambden have said of it▪ had it appeared in those Days in the Glory and Splendor its last great Founder, for so we may justly call him, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft it in.</P>
<P><PB REF="367"/>
It is indeed a Palace for a Prince, a most magnificent Building, and, in spite of all the Difficulties or Disadvantages of Situation, is a perfect Beauty; nay, the very Obstructions and, as I called them, Disadvantages of its Situation, serve to set off its Beauty, and are, by the most exquisite Decoration of the Place, made to add to the Lustre of the whole. But it would take up a Volume by itself to describe it. I shall only touch at those Things which other Writers have omit¦ted; for as Mr. Hobbes has elegantly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t it off in Latin Verse, Mr. Cotton, after h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s manner, in English, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hers, in as good a manner as they can, in History; t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey have yet, all of them, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll I, for many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me; and y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t perhaps it shall be as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as it was in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more finish∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than the Build ng, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill have al∣ways an encrease of Ornament, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Possessors see room to add to its Glory.</P>
<P>The Front to the Garden is the most regul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Piece of Architect I have seen in all the North Part of England; the Pilaster se enty two Foot high to the foot of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after on the top; the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize under the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is spacious, and has the Motto of the Family upon it, the Letters so large (and gilded) as takes up the whole Front, tho' the Words are but these two:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CAVENDO TƲTƲS.</HEAD>
<P>The Sashes of the second Story we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere told are seventeen Foot high, the Plates polish'd Looking Glass, and the Wood work double gilded; which, I think, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o where else to be seen in England.</P>
<P>Under this Front lye the Gardens ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sitely sine; and to make a clear Vista <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Prospect beyond into the flat Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owards Hardwick, another Seat of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame owner, the Duke, to whom what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thers thought impossible, was not only made practicable, but easy, removed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erfectly carried away a great Mountain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat stood in the way, and which inter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pted the Prospect.</P>
<P>This was so entirely gone, that, ha∣ving taken a strict View of the Gardens at my first being there, and retaining an Idea of them in my Mind, I was perfect∣ly confounded at coming there a second time, and not knowing what had been done; for I had lost the Hill, and found a new Country in view, which Chats∣worth itself had never seen before.</P>
<P>The House indeed had received Ad∣ditions▪ as it did every Year, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perhaps would to this Day▪ had th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duke liv'd, who had a Genius <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such Things beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each of the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rfect Masters, and was not only capable to design, but to finish</P>
<P>The Gardens, the Water-works, the Cascades, the Statues, Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a and Painting, tho' they are but very imperfectly de∣scribed by any of the Writers who have yet named them, and more imperfectly by one Author, who has so lately pre∣tended to View them; yet I dare not venture to m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion them here least, for want of time, and having so long a Jour∣ney to go▪ I should, l ke those who have gone before me▪ do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t imp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ectly, or leave no room to do Justice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o other Per∣sons and Places, which I am still to men∣tion. I shall therefore, as I said above, only touch at what others have omit∣ted.</P>
<P>First, 'tis to be observed that on the East Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rises a very high Mountain, on the top of which they dig Mill stones, and it begins so close to, and so overlgoks the House, being prodigiously high that, should they roll down a pair of those Stones coupled with a wooden Axis, as is the way of drawing them, they would in∣fallibly give a Shock to the Building; yet this Mountain is so planted, and so cover∣ed with a Wood of beautiful Trees, that you see no Hill, only a rising Wood, as if the Trees grew so much higher than one another, and was only a Wall of Trees, whose tops join into one another so close, as nothing is seen through them.</P>
<P>Upon the top of that Mountain begins a vast extended Moo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Waste, which,
<PB REF="368"/>
for fifteen or sixteen Miles together due North, presents you with neither Hedge, House or Tree, but a waste and houl∣ing Wilderness, over which when Strang∣ers travel, they are obliged to take Guides, or it would be next to impossible not to lose their way.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more surprising of its Kind, than for a Stranger coming from the North, suppose from Sheffield in Yorkshire, for that is the first Town of Note, and wandering or labouring to pass this difficult Desart Country, and seeing no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of it, and almost discouraged and heaten out with the Fatigue of it, (just such was our Case) on a sudden the Guide br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs him to this Precipice, where he look<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down from a frightf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l heighth, and a com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, barren, and, as he thought, endless Moor, into the most delightful Valley, with the most plea∣sant Gard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beautiful Palace in the World. If contraries illustrate, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace can admit or any Illustration, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t needs add to the Splendor of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e situation, and to the Beauty of the Building, and I must say, with which I will close my short Observation. If there is any wonder in Chatsworth, it is that any Man who had a Genius suitable to so magnificent a Design, who could lay out the Plan for such a House, and had a Fund to support the Charge, would build it in such a Place where the moun∣tains insult the Clouds, intercept the Sun, and would threaten, were Earthquakes frequent here, to buy the very Towns, much more the House, in their Ruins.</P>
<P>On the top of the Mountain, that is to say, on the Plain which extends from it, is a large Pond or Basin for Water, spreading as I was told, near thirty Acres of Ground, which, from all the Ascents round it, receives, as into a Cistern, all the water that falls, and from which again by Pipes, the Cascades, Water∣works, Ponds, and Canals in the Gar∣dens, are plentifully supplied.</P>
<P>On the West side, which is the Front or Entrance of the House, and where the first Foundress built a very august Por∣tal or Gate; I say, on the West side, runs the River Derwent, which, though not many Miles from it, source here, is yet a terrible River, when, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asty Rains, or by the melting of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows, the Hills are pleased to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> waters into its Channel; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Cur∣rent is so rapid▪ and it has to many con∣tracted Passages among the Rocks, and so many little Cataracts among the stones of which sometimes we see some o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an incredible Bulk come rowling down its Stream; I say, there are so many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these, that the River, on the least Mo∣tion of its waters above their ordinary heighth, roars like the Breaches on the Shores of the Sea.</P>
<P>Over this River there is a stately Stone Bridge, with an ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon it, and in an Island in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an ancient Fabrick all of Stone, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like a Castle. All these are the Works of the first Foundress, the Counte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shrewsbury, and shew the greatne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first Design; but except the Bridge are now, as it were, eclips'd by the mo∣dern Glories of the later Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice.</P>
<P>In my Discourse of the Palace of Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣worth must not be forgot that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Compliment which the Mare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Tall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd pass'd upon it, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Devonshire entertained him at Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣worth, namely, <Q>“”That when he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> give his Master the King of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the History of his seven Years <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in England, he would leave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those three Days which he had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so agreeable with his Grace, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the finest Palace in the World.</Q></P>

Rock; this opening goes directly down perpendicular into the Earth and per∣haps to the Center; it may be about twenty Foot over one way, and fifty or sixty the other; it has no Bottom, that is to say, none that can yet be heard of Mr. Cotton says, he let down eight hundred Fathoms of Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into it, and that the Plummet drew still; so that, in a word▪ he founded about a Mile per∣pendicular; for as we call a Mile 1760 Yards, and 884 is above half, then doubt∣less eight hundred Fathoms must be 1600 Yards which is near a Mile.</P>
<P>This I allow to be a Wonder, and what the like of is not to be found in the World, that I have heard of, or be∣lieve. And would former Writers have been contented with one Wonder instead of seven, it would have done more Hon∣our to the Peak, and even to the whole Nation, than the adding five imaginary Miracles to it that had nothing in them, and which really depreciated the whole.</P>
<P>What Nature meant in leaving this Window open into the infernal World, if the Place lies that way, we cannot tell: But it must be said, there is some∣thing of Horror upon the very imagi∣nation, when one does but look into it; and therefore tho' I cannot find much in Mr. Cotton, of merry Memory, worth quoting, yet on this Subject, I think, he has four very good Lines, speaking of his having an involuntary Horror at look∣ing into this Pit. The Words are these:</P>

<L>"For he, who standing on the Brink of Hell,</L>

<P>They tell a dismal story here, of a Tra∣veller, who enquiring his way to Cast∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, or to Buxton, in a dark Night, two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offer'd to guide him; but, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding to rob him, led him to the edge of this Gulph, and either thrust him in, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rpersuaded him to believe there was a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Gall of Water, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him take a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rge Step, which the innocent Unfortu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate did, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mistrusting the Treachery, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ept at once into E ernity; a Story <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough to make the Blood run cold <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rough the Heart of those that hear it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, especially if they know the Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o: They add, that one of these Vil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns being han<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at Derby some Years <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er for some other Vill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny, confess'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Murther at the Gallows.</P>
<P>Having then viewed those Things <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an impartial Mind, give me leave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duce the Wonders of the Peak to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Number, and of a quite different <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d</P>
<P N="1">1. Elden Hole I acknowlege to be a wonderful Place, as I have said above but to me the greatest Surprize is, that; after such a real Wonder, any of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, fles added to it could bear the Name of Wonders</P>
<P N="2">2 Of Buxton; the Wonder to me is, that in a Nation so full of Chronical dis∣eases as we are, such as our Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>buticks, Rheumaticks Cholicks, and Niphritick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, there should be such a Foundation of Me∣dicine sent from Heaven, and no more notice taken of it, or care to make it useful.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in a Nation so curious, so in∣quiring, and so critical as this is, any thing so unsatisfying, so folish and so weak, should pass for Wonders at those Mam Tor, Tide swell, Poole's Hole, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. As to Chatsworth, the Wonder, as I said before, seems to me; not that so noble and magnisicent a Palace should be built, but that it should be built in such a Manner and Situation, and in
<PB REF="370"/>
such a Country so out of the way, so concealed from the World, that who∣ever sees it must take a Journey on pur∣pose.</P>
<P>Having thus viewed the two Countries of Nottingham and Derby, as beginning that Part of England, which we call North by Trent, I resolved to go Northward on the East Side of the Island, taking the Western Shore, or the Irish Sea in my return.</P>
<P>The Peak concludes the Northern Part of Derbyshire; nor are there any Towns on that Side worth noting. There are some other Curiosities in the Peak in∣deed, which would deserve a fuller Ac∣count, had I leisure to enlarge or descend to Particulars, as the Tottering Stones at Byrch Over, the Roman Causeway, called Bath Gate, the several Minerals found in the Hills, and in the Lead Mines, as Black Lead, Stibium or Anti∣mony, Christal, and other Things, all much more rare than the Wonders they speak of.</P>
<P>Bakewell, is the best Town in the North West Side of the Peak, near which the Duke of Rutland has a very noble Palace, called Haddon; but after Chats∣worth no House in the same County can bear a Description; so we left the Peak, and went to Chesterfield, a handsome Market Town at the northermost Border of the County, North East from Chats∣worth.</P>
<P>There is indeed an extended Angle of this County, which runs a great way North West by Cappel in the Frith, and which they call High Peak. This, per∣haps, is the most desolate, wild, and aban∣doned Country in all England; the Moun∣tains of the Peak, of which I have been speaking, seem to be but the beginning of Wonders to this Part of the Country, and but the beginning of Mountains, or, if you will, as the lower Rounds of a Ladder. The tops of these Hills seem to be as much above the Clouds, as the Clouds are above the ordinary Range of Hills▪</P>
<P>Nor is this all; but the Countinuance of these Mountains is such, that we know no Bounds set to them, but they run on in a continued Ridge or Ledge of Moun∣tains from one to another, till they ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lost in the Southern Parts of Scotland, and even through that to the Highlands; so that they may be said to divide Bri∣tain, as the Appennine Mountains di∣vide Italy. Thus these Hills joyning to Blackstone Edge divide Yorkshire from Lancashire, and going on North divi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the Bishoprick of Durham from W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣moreland, and so on. It is from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ridge of Mountains that all the Rivers in the North of England take their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I may say ALL, for it is so to a very trifle, not a considerable River North of this County too, but begin here; th <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the East Side run into the German Ocean, those on the West Side into of Irish. I shall begin the Observation here▪ the Dove and the Derwent rise both at this South End of them, and come away South to the Trent; but all the Rivers afterwards run, as above, East or West, and first the Mersee rises on the West Side and the Don on the East, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> runs to Warrington, #and into the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at Liverpoole; the other to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and into the Sea at Humber. I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Observation as I go, for to g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve an Account of Rivers, is the true guide to the giving the Reader the best Account <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Country. But to return to my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Chesterfield is a handsome pop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Town, well built and well inhabited, notwithstanding it stands in the farthes Part of this rocky Country; for long on the North West Side next to York∣shire, it enters Scarsdale, which is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ich fruitful Part of the Country, though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rounded with barren Moors and M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tains, for such the Name Scarsdale sign <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> according to that Master of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mr. Cambden.

<P><PB REF="371"/>
From hence (travelling still North) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red the great County of York, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncerta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n still which way to begin to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake a full View of it, for as 'tis a Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of a very great Extent, my Business <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not the situation of a meer Geogra∣phical description of it; I have nothing to do with the Longitude of Places, the Antiquities of Towns. Corporations, Buildings, Charters, &amp;c. nor much with the History of Men, Families, Ciites or Towns, but to give you a View of the whole in its present State, as also of the Commerce, Curiosities and Customs, according to my Title.</P>
<P>The County is divided into three Rid∣ings; as I entred it from the South, it follows, I went in, by what they call the West-Riding, which, as it is by much the largest, so it is the wealthiest and the most populous, has the greatest Towns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it, and the greatest Number of them; the greatest Manufactures, and conse∣quently the greatest share of Wealth, as it has also of People.</P>
<P>Two eminent Towns, tho' only meer Market Towns, and one of them no Corporation, open the Door into the West Riding of Yorkshire; these are Shef∣field and Doncaster. It is true, there is a little Market Town, at the very first Entrance into the County before we come to Doncaster. call'd Beautry, a Town blessd with two great Conveniencies which assists to its Support, and makes it a very well frequented Place.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it stands upon the great Post Highway, or Road from London to Scot∣land; and this makes it be full of very good Iuns and Houses of Entertain∣m nt.</P>
<P N="2">2 That the little but pleasant River I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le runs through, or rather just by, the side of it, which, contrary to the im∣port of its Name, is a full and quick, though not rapid and unsafe Stream, with a deep Channel, which carries Hoys, Lighters, Barges, or flat-bottom'd Vessels out of its Channel into the Trent, which comes within seven Mile of it, to a Place called Stockwith, and from thence to Burton, and from thence, in fair Wea∣ther quite to Hull; but if not, 'tis suf∣ficient to go to Stockwith, where Vessels of 200 Ton Burthen may come up to the Town loaden as well as empty</P>
<P>By this Navigation, this Town of Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣try becomes the Center of all the Ex∣portation of this Part of the Country, especially for heavy Goods, which they bring down hither from all the adjacent Countries, such as Lead, from the Smelt∣ing-Houses in Derbyshire, wrought Iron and Edge-Tools, of all Sorts, from the Forges at Sheffield, and from the Coun∣try call'd Hallamshire, being adjacent to the Towns of Sheffield and Rotherham, where an innumerable Number of Peo∣ple are employed; as I shallspeak more largely of in its Place.</P>
<P>Also Millstones and Grindstones, in very great Quantities, are brought down and shipped off here, and so carry'd by Sea to Hull, and to London, and even to Holland also. This makes Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>try Wharf be famous all over the South Part of the West-Riding of Yorkshire, for it is the Place whether all their heavy Goods are carried, to be embarked and shipped off.</P>
<P>From hence ro Doncaster is a pleasant Road, and good Ground, and never wants any Repair, which is very hard to be said in any Part of this lower side of the Country.</P>
<P>Doncaster is a noble, large, spacious Town, exceeding populous, and a great manufacturing Town, principally for Knitting; also as it stands upon the great Northern Post Road, it is very full of great Inns; and here we found our Land∣lord at the Post house was Mayor of the Town as well as Post Master, that he kept a Pack of Hounds, was Com∣pany for the best Gentlemen in the Town or in the Neighbourhood, and lived as great as any Gentleman ordina∣rily did.</P>
<P>Here we saw the first Remains or Ruins of the great Roman Highway,
<PB REF="372"/>
which, though we could not perceive it before, was eminent and remarkable here, just at the Entrance into the Town; and soon after appeared again in many Places: Here are also two great, lofty, and very strong Stone Bridges over the Don, and a long Causeway also beyond the Bridges, which is not a little dan∣gerous to Passengers when the Waters of the Don are restrained, and swell over its Banks, as is sometimes the Case.</P>
<P>This Town, Mr. Cambden says, was burnt entirely to the Ground, Anno 759, and is hardly recovered yet; but I m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st say, it is so well recovered, that I see no Ruins appear, and indeed, being al∣most a thousand Years ago, I know not how there should; and besides, the Town seems as if it wanted another Conflagration, for it looks old again, and many of the Houses ready to fall.</P>
<P>I should, before I leave Doncaster, give you the famous Epitaph of one Robert Byrk, a famous Man of Donca∣ster, who lies buried in the great Church here, who gave a Place call'd Rossing∣ton Wood, to the Poor. On his Grave is this Epitaph in old English:</P>
<LG>

<L>I, Robin of Doncastere,</L>

<L>Threescore Years and seven, but liv'd not one.</L>
<L><BIBL><HI>Anno</HI> 1579.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>Here lies also, under a plain Grave stone in St. George's Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Body of one Thomas Ellis, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> memorable Person. He was five <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mayor of the Town, founded an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Town, called St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Apostle, and endowed it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Strange! that of but two several Au∣thors writing a Description of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but very lately, and pretending to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> positively of the Places, which they ought not to have done, if they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been there, both of them should so strange∣ly mistake, as one to say of Doncaster, that there was a large Church with a high Spire Steeple and the other to say of the Cathedral at York, that from the Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Cathedral at York, you have an unbounded Prospect: Whereas neither has the Tower of York, or the Tower at Don∣caster, any Spire, unless they will pre∣tend any of the small Pinacles at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Corners of the two Towers at the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st End of the Church at York, are to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e call'd THE SPIRE of THE Cathedra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; so fit are such Men to write Descript<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces of a Country.</P>
<P>Leaving Doncaster, we turned out of the Road at little way to the left, where we had a fair View of that antient <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> making, Cutlering Town, called Sheffield, the Antiquity, not of the Town only▪ but of the Trade also, is established <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those famous Lines of Geostry <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Miller of Trumpington, which, however they vary from the print in Chaucer, as now extant, I give it you as I find it:</P>
<LG>
<L>At <HI>Trumpington,</HI> not far from <HI>Cambridge,</HI></L>
<L>There dwelt a Miller upon a Bridge;</L>
<L>With a rizzl'd Beard, and a hooked Nose,</L>
<L>And a Whittl in his Hose.</L>
</LG>
<P>This Town of Sheffield is very po∣pulous and large, the Streets narrow, and the Houses dark and black, occa∣sioned by the continued Smoke of the Forges, which are always at work: Here they make all Sorts of Cutlery∣ware,
<PB REF="373"/>
but sepecially that of Edged-Tools, Knives, Razors, Axes, &amp;c. and Nails; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd here the only Mill of the Sort, which was in use in England for some time was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et up, viz. for turning their Grindstones, though now 'tis grown more common.</P>
<P>Here is a very spacious Church, with very handsome and high Spire; and the Town is said to have at least as many, if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot more People in it than the City of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ork. Whether they have been exactly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbered one against the other. I can∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot tell. The Manufacture of Hard Ware, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich has been so antient in this Town▪ not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continued, but much encreased; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much that they told us there, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands employed in it were a prod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver dwelt, as well in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as in the Bounds of that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hallamshire; and they talked of 30000 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> employed in the whole; but I leave upon the Credit of Report.</P>
<P>There was formerly a very sine Castle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a noble Mansion-House, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of the Dukes of Norfolk; but it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w all demolished and decayed, though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Estate or Manor remains still in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly. In the great Church of this Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several very antient Monuments of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly of Talbots, Earls of Shrewsbury, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o once had great Possessions in this the next County.</P>
<P>The Queen of Scots was also for a long <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e detained here as Prisoner, not lets <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sixteen or seventeen Years, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fatal afterward to the House of Nor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; as is to be seen at large in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> History.</P>

<P>Here is a sine Engine or Mill also for raising Water to supply the Town, which was done by Mr <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ocoal, the same who fell into the River at the Throwing Mill at Derby, as is said in its Place: Here is also a very large and strong Bridge over the Don, as there is another at Rother∣ham, a Market Town six Miles lower. Here is also a very fine Hospital, with the Addition of a good Revenue, settled at first by Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, and confirmed afterwards by the Family of Howard, Dukes of Norfolk.</P>
<P>George, the first Earl of Shrewbury, who died 1538. George the second, Grandson to the first, to whose Custody the Queen of Scots was committed, who died 1590, and Gilbert his Son, who founded the Hospital above mentioned, all lie buried here.</P>
<P>The Gift of this Hospital is thus do∣cumented:</P>

<P>It is in this Park that the great Oak Tree grew, which Mr. Evenlyn gives a long Account of in his Book of Forest Trees; but as I did not see it, I
<PB REF="374"/>
refer to the said Mr. Evelyn's Account. The Chesnut Tree near Aderclift, which Mr. Camden's Continuator mentions, the Body of which could hardly be sathom'd by three Men, I suppose was gone▪ for I could hear nothing of it.</P>
<P>But the Remains of the Roman Fortifi∣cation or Encampment between Sheffield and Rotherham, is there still, and very plain to be seen, and, I suppose, may re∣main so to the End of Time.</P>
<P>Here is also the famous Bauk or Trench which some call Devil's Bank, others Danes Bank; but 'tis frequent with us to give the Honour of such great Trenches, which they think was never worth the while for Men to dig, to the Devil, as if he had more leisure, or that it was less trouble to him than to a whole Army of Men. This Bank, 'tis said, runs five Miles in Length; in some Places 'tis called Kemp Bank, in others Temple's Bank.</P>
<P>Rotherham was the next Town of any Bulk, in which, however, I saw nothing of Note, except a fine Stone Bridge over the Don, which is here encreased by the River Rother, from whence the Town, I suppose, took its Name, as the famous Bishop Rotherham did his from the Town; I will not say he was a soundling Child in the Streets, and so was sirnamed from the Place, as is often suggested in such Cases, though, if he was so, it did not diminish his Character, which was that of a great and good Man. He was Arch∣bishop of York, and was a great Bene∣factor to this Town, having founded a College here; but it seems it has been a long while ago.</P>
<P>From Rotherham we turned North West to Wentworth, on purpose to see the old Seat of Tankersly, and the Park, where I saw the largest Red Deer that, I be∣lieve, are in this Part of Europe: One of the Hinds, I think, was larger than my Horse, and he was not a very small Pad of fourteen Hands and half high. This was antiently the Dwelling of the great Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, beheaded in King Charles the First's time by a Law, <HI>expost facto,</HI> voted afterward not to be drawn into a Precedent. The Body lies interred in Wentworth Church</P>

<P>The Calder passes through this Town under a stately Stone Bridge of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arches, upon which is a famous Build∣ing, by some called a Chapel, by others a Castle; the former is the most likely: It was built by Edward the Fourth, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Memory of the fatal Battle of Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣field, wherein his Father, Richard, Duke of York, was killed by the Lancas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Army, under the Command of Margare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Queen to Henry the Sixth, <HI>Anno</HI> 1460. It was indeed a fatal Battle; but as this is not any Part of this Work, I leave it to the Historians to give a fuller Ac∣count of it; only one Thing I must add, namely, that a little on this Side of the Town, I mean South between Wake∣field, and a Village called Sandal, they shewed us a little square Piece of Ground, which was senced off by it self; and on which, before the late War, stood a large Stone Cross, in Memory of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Battle; just upon that Spot, the Duke of York fighting desperately, and refusing to yield, tho' surrounded with Enemies,
<PB REF="375"/>
was kill'd. The Chapel on the Bridge at Wakefield, the other Monument of this Battle, is now made use of for Civil Af∣fairs; for we do not now pray for the Souls of those slain in Battle, and so the intent of that Building ceases.</P>
<P>Wakefield is a clean, large, well-built Town, very populous and very rich; here is a very large Church, and well filled it is, for here are very few Dissenters; the Steeple is a very fine Spite, and by far the highest in all this Part of the Coun∣try, except that at Sheffield. They tell us, there are here more People also than in the City of York, and yet it is no Cor∣poration Town; and the highest Magis∣trate, as I understand, was a Constable.</P>
<P>Here also is a Market every Friday for Woollen, Cloaths▪ after the manner of that at Leeds tho' not so great; yet as all the Cloathing Trade is encreasing in this Country, so this Market too flourishes with the rest; not bat the sometimes, as foreign Markets receive interruption ei∣ther by Wars, by a glut of the Goods, or by any other incident, there are inter∣ruptions of the Manufacture too, which, when it happen, the Clothiers are sure to complain of loss of Trade; but when the demand comes again they are not equally forward with their Acknowledg∣ments; and this, I observed, was the case every where else, as well as here.</P>
<P>I cannot pass by my former Observa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on here, namely, now evidently all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat Rivers take their Beginning in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountains of Blackstone Edge and High <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ak, which, as I have said, part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounties of Lancaster and York, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w these Rivers take all their Course <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e East. The Don was the first; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt is the Calder, coming now to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y large River at Wakefield; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is the next, which, running another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of which I shall speak presently, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves the Calder into it.</P>
<P>The River Calder, of which I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Account by and by, having tra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it from its beginning, receiving a migh▪ Confluence of Rivers into it, is now, have said, become a large River, and the first Town it comes near of Note is Huthersfield, another large Cloathing Place; it passes also by Eland, where there is a very fine Stone Bridge. This was the original Seat of the Earls or Mar∣quisses of Hallifax, when the Title went in the Name of Savile. Huthersfield is one of the five Towns which carry on that vast Cloathing Trade by which the Wealth and Opulence of this Part of the Country has been raised to what it now is, and where those Woollen Manufactures are made in such prodigious Quantities, which are known by the Name of York∣shire Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sies. Whether the Scandal rais∣ed upon this Country be just or not (viz.) shrinking Cloth and sharping K—s, that I will not take upon me to determine; at this Town there is a Market for Kersies every Tuesday.</P>
<P>Nor, as I speak of their Manufactures, must I forget that most essential Manu∣fucture called Yorkshire Ale, which in∣deed is in its Perfection here, and in all this Part of the County; of which I shall speak again in its Place.</P>
<P>As the Calder rises in Blackstone Edge, so the Aire, another of the Yorkshire Rivers, rises, tho' in the same Ridge of Hills, yet more particularly at the Foot of the Mountain Pennigent, on the Edge of Lancashire, of which 'tis said prover∣bially:</P>
<LG>
<L>Pendle-Hill and Pennigent,</L>
<L>Are the highest Hills,</L>
<L>Between Scotland and Trent.</L>
</LG>
<P>As the Calder runs by Hallifax, Huthers∣field, and through Wak<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field; so the Aire runs by Skippon, Bradforth and thorough Leeds, and then both join at Castleford Bridge, near Pontefract, so in an united Stream forming that useful Navigation from this trading part of Yorkshire to Hull; to the infinite Advantage of the whole Country, and which, as I took a singular Satisfaction in visiting and en∣quiring into, so I believe you will be no less delighted in reading the Account of it, which will be many Ways both use∣ful
<PB REF="376"/>
and very instructive; and the more so, because none of the pretended Travel-Writers and Journeyers thro' England, have yet thought this most remarkable Part of our Country worth their speaking of, or knew not how to go about it: Nor have we so much as mentioned this whole Part of England, which is, on many Accounts, the most considerable of all the Northern Divisions of this Nation.</P>
<P>It is not easy to take a View of this populous and wealthy Part, called the West Riding, at one, no, nor at two Journies, unless you should dwell upon it, and go cross the Country backward and forward, on Purpose to see this or that considerable Place. This is perhaps the Reason why, as I hinted above, the other Writers of Journies and Travels this Way might not see how to go about it. But, as I was resolved to have a perfect Know∣ledge of the most remarkable Things, and especially of the Manufactures of Eng∣land, which I take to be as well worth a Traveller's Notice, as the most curions Thing he can meet with, and which is so prodigious great in this Quarter. I made no less than three Journies into, and thro', this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>In my first Journey I came only West from York to Wakefield, and then, turn∣ing South by Barnsley or Doncaster, went away still South to Rotherham, Sheffield, Chesterfield, Chatsworth, and the Peak, all which Journey, except York, and the Towns about it, and in the Way to it, I have mentioned already.</P>
<P>The second Journey, I came out of the Western Part of England, namely, from Cheshire thro' Lancashire, and, pas∣sing West over those Andes of England, called Blackstone Edge, and the Mountains, which, as I hinted before, part Yorkshire and Lancashire, and reach from the High Peak to Scotland, I came to Hallifax, Bradforth, Huthersfield, Leeds, Wetherby, Pontefact and Burrow Bridge, and so went away into the East Riding, as you have hear.</P>
<P>The third Journey, I went from the Peak in Derbyshire again, and, traversing the same Country as I returned by in the first Journey as far as Wakefield, went on again North to Leeds, and thence over Harwood Bridge to Knaresborough Spaw, thence to Rippon, and thro' that old Ro∣man Street-way, called Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming-Lane, to Pier's Bridge, thence to Durham, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o into Scotland; of all which in their Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>If, by all these Circuits, and traversing the Country so many Ways, which I name for the Reasons above, I am <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> furnished to give a particular Account of the most remarkable Things, I must have spent my Time very ill, and ought not to let you know how often I went thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>In my second Journey, as above, I came from Lancashire, where you are to note, that all this Part of the Country is so considerable for its Trade, that the Post-Master General had thought s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to establish a Cross-Post thro' all the W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n Part of England into it, to mainta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Correspondence of Merchants and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Business, of which all this Side of the Island is so full; this is a Confirmation of what I have so often repeated▪ and may still repeat many times on farther Occa∣sion, of the Greatness of the Trade carri∣ed on in this Part of the Island. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cross Post begins at Plymou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, in the South West Part of England, and, leav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g the great Western Post Road of Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>er behind, comes away North to Tann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Bridgwater and Bristol; from thence gees on thro' all the great Cities and Tow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s up the Severn; such as Gloucester, Wer∣cester, Bridgenorth and Shrewsbury, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e by West Chester to Liverpool and W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rington, from whence it turns away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and passes to Manchester, Bury, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hallifax, Leeds and York, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Hull.</P>
<P>By this Means the Merchants at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have immediate Advice of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which go out of the Channel, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in; by their Letters from Plymouth, as readily as the Merchants at London, and without the double Charge of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The Shop keepers and Manufactures <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n

<P>It is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to express the Conster∣nation we were in when we came up near he Top of the Mountain; the Wind blow exceeding hard indeed, and blew the Snow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in our Faces, and that so thick, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was impossible to keep our <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to see our way. The Ground also was so covered with Snow, that we could see no Trick, or when we were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Way, or when out, ex∣cept when we were showed it by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> on one Hand, and uneven <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the other; even our Horses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Uneasiness at it; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that was my fel∣low <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and usually diverted us with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mark for our Gun, turn'd tail <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o it and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>In the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of this Difficulty, and as we began to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o one another to turn back again, not knowing what Dangers might still be before us, came a surpri∣sing Clap of Thunder, the first that ever I heard in a storm of Snow, or, I believe, ev r shall; nor did we perceivd any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ightning to precede the Thunder, as must naturally be the Case; but we sup∣pose the thick falling of the Snow might prevent our Sight.</P>
<P><PB REF="378"/>
I must confess I was very much sur∣prized at this Blow; and one of our Com∣pany would not be persuaded that it was Thunder, but that it was some Blast of a Coal Pit, things which do sometimes hap∣pen in the Country, where there are ma∣ny Coal Mines. But we were all against him in that, and were fully satisfied that it was Thunder, and, as we fancyed, at last we were confirmed in it, by hearing more of it at a Distance from us.</P>
<P>Upon this we made a full Stop, and coming altogether, for we were then three in Company, with two Servants, we be∣gan to talk seriously of going back again to Rochdale; but just then one of our Men called out to us, and said, he was up∣on the Top of the Hill, and could see over into Yorkshire, and that there was a plain Way down on the other Side.</P>
<P>We rode all up to him, and found it as the Fellow had said, all but that of a plain Way; there was indeed the Mark or Face of a Road on the Side of the Hill, a little turning to the left North; but it was so narrow, and so deep a hol∣low Place on the right, whence the Wa∣ter descending from the Hills made a Chan∣nel at the bottom, and looked as the be∣ginning of a River, that the depth of the Precipice, and the narrowness of the Way, looked horrible to us; after going a little way in it, the Way being blinded too by the Snow, the hollow on the right appeared deeper and deeper, so we resolv∣ed to alight and lead our Horses, which we did for about a Mile, though the violence of the Wind and Snow continu∣ing, it was both very troublesome and dangerous.</P>
<P>The only Reliefs we had in this Track were, (1.) That we perceived some Land Marks, or Tokens, which the honest Rochdale Men had given us notice of, by which we believed we were right in the Way; for till then we knew nothing where we were, or whether we were right or wrong. And, (2) that as the Road we were in descended apace, for it went very steep down, we found the lower we went the Violence of the Snow abated, just as on the other Side of the Hill the higher we went, it had encreased.</P>
<P>At lenghth, to our great Joy, we found too the Wind abated, as well as the Snow, that is to say, the Hills being so high be∣hind us, they kept back the Wind, as is the Case under a high Wall, though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are on the Windward Side of it, yet the Wind having no Passage through, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> felt, as it would be on the top where the Space is open for it to pass.</P>
<P>All this Way the hollow on our right continued very deep, and just on the o∣ther Side of it a parallel H ll continued going on East, as that did which we rode on the Side of; the main Hill which we came down from, which is properly cal∣led Blackstone Edge, or, by the Country People, the Edge, without any S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rname or Addition, ran along due North, cros∣sing and shutting up those hollow Gulls and Vallies between, which were cer∣tainly originally formed by the Rain and Snow Water running into them▪ and forc∣ing its way down washing the Earth gra∣dually along with it, till, by length of Time, it wore down the Surface to such a Depth.</P>
<P>We continued descending still, and as the Weather was quieter, so the Way seemed to mend and be broader, and, to our great Satisfaction, enclining more to the Hill on the lest; the precipice and hollow Part where the Water run, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have said, went a little off from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and by and by, to our no small Comfort, we saw an enclosed Piece of Ground that is enclosed with a Stone Wall, and soon af∣ter a House, where we aked our way, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found we were right.</P>
<P>Soon after this we came to the bottom, by another very steep Descent, where we were obliged to alight again, and lead our Horses. At the bottom, we found the hollow part, which I have so often men∣tioned as a Precipice, was come to a level with us, that is to say, we were come down to a level with it, and it turning to the left toward us, we found a Brook of

<P>But, to cut short the tedious Day's Work the Case was this; the Hill was very high and, in our Opinion, not in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erior to the Edge which we came just down from; but the Sun being higher, and the Wind not blowing so hard, what Snow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll upon the Hill melted as it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o we saw our Way plainer, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hill, though with some labour, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> any terror or apprehensions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Way, falling down, Precipices, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>But our Case was still this; that as soon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were at the top of every Hill, we h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it to come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own again on the o∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and as soon as we were down we had another to mount, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for I do not remember that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was one Bottom that had any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Breadth of plain Ground in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lways a Brook in the Valley running <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those Galls and Deeps between the Hills, with this Remark, that they always cross'd our Way in the Bottoms from the Right-hand to the Left, the Reason of which you shall see presently.</P>
<P>From Blackstone Edge to H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ax is eight Miles, and all the Way, except from Sorby to Hallifax, is thus up Hill and down; so that, I suppose, we moun∣ted to the Clouds and descended to the Water level about eight times, in that little Part of the Journey.</P>
<P>But now I must observe to you, that after having pass'd the second Hill, and come do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n into the Valley again, and so still the nearer we came to Hallifax, we found the Houses thicker, and the Vil∣lages greater in every Bottom: and not only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, but the Sides of the Hills, which were very sleep every way, were spread with Houses, and that very thick; for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Land being divided into small Enclo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, that is to say, from two Acres to si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or seven Acres each, seldom more; every th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee or four Pieces of Land had a Hou <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> belonging to it.</P>

but help'd and establish'd by them being constantly employ'd, and, as we call it, their working hard; so that they find a double Advantage by their being always in Business.</P>
<P>This Business is the Clothing Trade, for the Convenience of which the Houses are thus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>attered and spread upon the sides of the Hills, as above, even from the Bottom to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Reason is this; such has been the Bounty of Na∣ture to this otherwise frightful Country, that two Things essential to the Business, as well as to the Ease of the People are found here, and that in a situation which I never saw the like of in any part of England; and, I believe, the like is not to be seen so contrived in an Part of the World; I mean Coals, and running Wa∣ter upon the Tops of the highest Hills: This seems to have been directed by the wise Hand of Providence for the very Purpose which is now served by it, namely, the Manufactures, which other∣wise could nor be carried on; neither in∣deed could one fifth Part of the Inhabi∣tants be supported without them, for the Land could not maintain them. Af∣ter we had mounted the third Hill, we found the Country, in short, one con∣tinued Village, tho' mountainous every way, as before; hardly a House stand∣ing out of a speaking distance from one another, and (which soon told us their Business) the Day clearing up, and the Sun shining, we could see that at almost at every House there was a Ten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er▪ and almost on every Tenter a Piece of Cloth, or Kersie, or Shalloon, for they are three Articles of that Country's Labour; from which the Sun glancing, and as I may say, shining (the White reflecting its Rays) to us, I thought it was the most agreeable Sight that I ever saw, for the Hills, as I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so thick, and the Vallies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> way, sometim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> times we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this Way, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> called the Seven Dials; we could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through the Glades almost every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> round us, yet look which Way we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high to the Tops, and low to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was all the same; innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Tenters, and a white Piece upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tenter.</P>

Manufacturer generally keeps a Cow or two, or more, for his Family, and this employs the two, or three, or four Pieces of enclosed Land about his House, for they scarce sow Corn enough for their Cocks and Hens; and this feeding their Grounds still adds by the Dung of the Cattle to enrich the Soil.</P>
<P>But now, to speak of the Bounty of Nature again, which I but just mention∣ed; it is to be observed, that these Hills are so furnished by Nature with Springs and Mines, that not only on the Sides, but even to the very Tops, there is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arce a Hill but you find, on the high∣est Part of it, a Spring of Water, and a Coal-Pit. I doubt not but there are both Springs and Coal-Pits lower in the Hills, '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s enough to say they are at the top; but, as I say, the Hills are so full of Springs, so the lower Coal-Pits may per∣haps be too full of Water, to work with∣out Dreins to carry it off, and the Coals in the upper Pits being easie to come at, they may chuse to work them, because the Horses which fetch the Coals, go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight up the Hill, and come loaden down.</P>
<P>Having thus Fire and Water at every Dwelling, there is no need to enquire why they dwell thus dispers'd upon the highest Hills, the Convenience of the Manufacturers requiring it. Among the Manufacturers Houses are likewise scattered an infinite Number of Cottages or small Dwellings, in which dwell the Workmen which are employed, the Wo∣men and Children of whom, are always busy Carding, Spinning, &amp;c. so that no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands being unemploy'd all can get their Bread, even from the youngest to the an∣tient; hardly any thing above four Years old, but its hands are sufficient to its self.</P>
<P>This is the Reason also why we saw <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few People without Doors; but if we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nock'd at the Door of any of the Ma∣ter Manufacturers, we presently saw a House full of lusty Fellows, some at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye sat, some one thing, some another, all hard at Work, and full employed upon the Manufacture, and all seeming to have sufficient Business.</P>
<P>I should not have dwelt so upon this Part, if there was not abundance of Things subsequent to it, which will be explained in this one Description, and which are needful to be understood by any one that desires a full understanding of the Manner how the People of England are employed, and do subsist in these re∣moter Parts where they are so numerous; for this is one of the most populous Parts of Britain, London and the adjacent Parts excepted.</P>
<P>Having thus described the Country, and the Employment of the People, I am to tell you, that this Part of it which I mentioned, is all belonging to and in the Parish of Hallifax, and that brings me on towards the Town which I shall speak of presently.</P>
<P>I must only say a Word or two of the River Calder, to compleate the De∣scription ef the Country I thus pass'd through. I hinted to you, that all the Rills or Brooks of Water which we cross'd, one at least in every Bottom, went away to the Left or North Side of us as we went forward East: I am to add, that following those little Brooks with our Eye, we could observe, that at some distance to the Left there appeared a larger Valley than the rest, into which not only all the Brooks which we pass'd emptied themselves, but abundance more from the like hollow deep Bottoms, among the Hills on the North Side of it, which emptied this way South, as those on our Side run that way North; so that it was natural to conclude, that in this larger Valley the Waters of all those Brooks joining, there must be some pretty large stream which received them all, and ran forward East, parallel to the way we were in.</P>
<P>After some time we found that great Opening seemed to bind Southward towards us, and that probably it would cross our Road, or our Road would rather cross
<PB REF="382"/>
the Valley; and so it was naturl to ex∣pect we should pass that larger Water, either by a Bridge or a Ford; but we were soon convinced it was not the lat∣ter; for the Snow, as is said, having pour∣ed down a Quantity of Water, we soon found at the next Opening, that there was a considerable River in the larger Valley, which, having received all those little Brooks, was risen to a little Flood; and at the next Village we pass'd it over a stately Stone Bridge of several great Arches. This Village is called So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by or Sowreby; and this was the main River Calder, which I mentioned at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where it begins to be Navigable, and which, without any Spring o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fountain, to be called the Head or Source of it, is formed on the Declivity of these Moun∣tains, meerly by the continued fall of Rains and Snows, which the said Moun∣tains intercepting the Clouds, are seldom free from; and this Stream receiving the smaller Gulls and Hollows, I just now mentioned, like a Common-shore, carries all away in the Channel of a noble Ri∣ver.</P>
<P>This is the beginning of the Calder; and my Reason for dwelling upon it, and giving so particular a Description, is, be∣cause this may, once for all, shew you how all, or most of the great Rivers in the North, take their Rise, there being hardly any that has their beginning in any Publick Springs or Lakes, as most of the Rivers in the South of England have, as the Thames, for example, near Tring in Hertfordshire, the Vandal at Croydon and Cashalton, the Amewell at Ware, and the like.</P>
<P>As the Calder is thus nothing but a Collection of Water from the fall of these Mountains, so was the Derwent, and the Don, from the High Peak, and the Hills of the same Range more South of the Edge, and so is the Aire, the Wharf, the Swa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the Eure, the Nid, the Tees, and the Were, all in the same County of York; and so the Tyne, the Cockett, the Till, and the Tweed, farther North; and even the like of the Forth, the Tay, the Clyde, the Nyd, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Mersee, the Riddle, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Lune, the West Calder, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the Eden, on the other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mountains, in Lancashire, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Cumberland And thus <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> will serve for all the rest.</P>
<P>Having thus, I say, accounted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all at once; I shall only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> now as they come in my way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> will observe, I cross'd one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them at every consider <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all the Rivers as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Scotland, North of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the middle of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mountains rise, either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> man, or West into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of them run like the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or the Rivers in South Wales, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in Devon, or the Av<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Arun in Sussex, and others <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> South. But I return to the North.</P>
<P>Having passed the Calder <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Bridge, I now began to approach <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Town of Hallifax; in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which, and its Dependencies, all my Ac∣count of the Commerce will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for take Hallifax, with all its Depen∣dencies, it is not to be equalled <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> First, the Parish or Vicaridge, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is but a Vicaridge; is, if not the larg∣est, certainly is the most popul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us in England; in short, it is a Monster, I mean, for a Country Parish, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> so far out of the way of foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Courts, or Sea Ports</P>
<P>The extent of the Parish, they tell us, is almost Circular, and is about twelve Miles in Diameter. There are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or thirteen Chapels of Ease, besides about sixteen Meeting-Houses, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also Chapels, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, having Bells to call the People, and Burying Grounds to most of them or else they bury with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them. I think they told me, the Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣kers Meetings, of which there are several that are not reckoned into the Number. In a word, it is some Years ago that a Reverend Clergyman of the Town of Hallifax, told me, they reckoned that
<PB REF="383"/>
they had a Hundred thousand Commu∣nicants in the Parish besides Children.</P>
<P>History tells us also, that in Queen Elizabeth's Time, when the Inhabitants of Hallifax addressed the Queen for some Privileges, which I do not a present re∣member the Particulars of, it was expres∣sed in the Petition as a moving Argument, why the Queen should take them into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Royal Care, that they were zealous Protestants, and were so loyal to her Ma∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as so considerable, that no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than twelve thousand young Men w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt out arm'd from this one Parish, and, at her Majesty's call, joined her Troops to fight the Popish Army, then the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under the Earl of Westmor∣land.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were so populous at that time▪ how much must they be encreased since? and especially since the late Revolution, the Trade having been prodigiously en∣couraged and encreased by the great De∣mand of their Kersies for clothing the Armies abroad, insomuch that it is the Opinion of some that know the Town, and its Bounds very well, that the Num∣ber of People in the Vicaridge of Halli∣fax▪ is encreased one fourth, at least, with∣in the last forty Years, that is to say, since the late Revolution. Nor is it im∣probable at all, for besides the Number of Houses which are encreased, they have entered upon a new Manufacture which was never made in those Parts before, at least, not in any Quantities, I mean, the Manufactures of Shalloons, of which they now make, if Fame does not bely them a hundred thousand P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ces a Year in this Parish only, and yet do not make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wer Kersies than they did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>The Trade in Kersies also was so great, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I was told by very creditable, honest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when I was there, Men not given <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or Boasting, and less to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that there was one Dealer in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who traded, by Commission, Threescore thousand Pounds a Year <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only, and all that to Holland <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>But not to enter into Particulars, it is evident, that the Trade must be exceeding great, in that it employs such a very great Number of People, and that, in this one Town only; for, as I shall fully describe in my Account of other Places, this is not what I may call the eldest Son of the Cloathing Trade in this County; the Town of Leeds challenges a Preemin∣ence, and, I believe▪ merits the Dignity it claims, besides the Towns of Huthers∣field, Bradforth, Wakefield, and others.</P>
<P>But I must not leave Hlalifax yet, as the Vicaridge is thus far extended, and the extent of it so peopled, what must the Market be, and where must this vast Number o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People be supplied For, (1.) As to Corn, I have observed already, they sow little and hardly enough to feed their Poultry, if they were to be Corn fed; and as to Beef and Mutton, they feed little or none; and as they are surrounded with latge, populous, Manufacturing Towns on every Side, all of them em∣ployed as these are, in the Cloathing Trade, they must then necessarily have their Provisions from other Parts of the Country.</P>
<P>This then is a Subsistence to the other Parts of the Country, and so it is for us, the West Riding is thus taken up, and the Lands occupied by the Manufacture; the Consequence is plain, their Corn comes up in great Quantities out of Lincoln, Nottingham, and the East Riding, their Black Cattle and Horses from the North Riding, their Sheep and Mutton from the adjacent Counties every way, their But∣ter from the East and North Riding, their Cheese out of ▪Cheshire and Warwick∣shire, more Black Cattle also from Lanca∣shire. And here the Breeders and Feeders, the Farmers and Country People find Mo∣ney flowing in plenty from the Manu∣facturers and Commerce; so that at Hal∣lifax, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the other great manu∣facturing Towns so often mentioned, and adjacent to these for the two Months of September and October, a prodigious Quantity of Black Cattle is sold.</P>
<P><PB REF="384"/>
This Demand for Beef is occasioned thus; the usage of the People is to buy in that Season Beef sufficient for that whole Year, which they kill and salt, and hang up in the Smoke to dry. This way of curing their Beef keeps it all the Winter, and they eat this smoak'd Beef as a very great Rarity</P>
<P>Upon this foot, 'tis ordinary for a Clothier that has a large Family, to come to Hallifax on a Market-Day, and buy two or three large Bullocks from eight to ten Pounds a-piece. These he carries home and kills for his Store. And this is the Reason that the Markets at all those Times of the Year are thronged with Black Cattle, as Smithfield is on a Friday; whereas all the rest of the Year there is little extraordinary sold there.</P>
<P>Thus this one trading, manufacturing Part of the Country supports all the Countries round it, and the Numbers of People settle here as Bees about a Hive.</P>
<P>As for the Town of Hallifax it self, there is nothing extraordinary except on a Market Day, and then indeed it is a prodigious Thing, by reason of the Mul∣titude of People who throng thither, as well to sell their Manufactures as to buy Provisions; and so great is the Conflu∣ence of People hither, that except Leeds and Wakefield, nothing in all the North Part of England can come near it.</P>
<P>The Church is old, but stately and venerable, and has in it many extraor∣dinary Monuments, but most of them of great Antiquity. Here is a very good Hospital, and a Work house of an ancient Establishment, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d there are several Cha∣rities, of like sort, in other Parts of the Parish.</P>
<P>But I must not quit Hallifax, till I give you some Account of the famous Course of Justice anciently executed here, to prevent the stealing of Cloth. Mo∣dern Accounts pretend to say, it was for all sorts of Felons; but I am well as∣sured, it was first erected purely, or at least principally, for such Thieves as were apprehended stealing Cloth from the Tent∣ers; and it seems very reasonable to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was so because of the Conditions of the Trial. The Case was thus:</P>
<P>The erecting the Woollen Manufacture here was about the Year 148<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Henry VII. by giving Encouragement to Foreigners to settle in England, and to set up Woollen Manufacture<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, caused an Act to pass prohibiting the Exporta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Wool into foreign Parts, unwrought, and to encourage foreign Manufacturers to come and settle here, of whom seve∣ral coming over settled the Manufactures of Cloths in several Parts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as they found the People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and as the Country best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> as the Bays at Colchester, the Says at Sudbury, the Broad Cloth in Wilts▪ and other Counties; so the trade of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and narrow Cloth fixed at this Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other adjacent Towns.</P>
<P>When this Trade began to settle, no∣thing was more frequent than for y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g Workmen to leave their Cloths ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Night upon the Tenters, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fellows would come in upon them, and tearing them off without notice, steal the Cloth. Now as it was absolutely necessa∣ry to preserve the Trade in its Infancy, this severe Law was made, giving <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Power of Life and Death so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 words" DISP="〈◊◊◊〉"/> hands of the Magistrates of Hallifax <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to see the Law executed upon them. As this Law was particularly pointed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the stealing of Cloth, and no other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so no others were capable of being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by it, and the Conditions of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> intimate as much; for th Power was not given to the Magistrates to give <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tence, unless in one of these three pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cases:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hand Napping,</HI> that is, to be t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ken in the very Fact, or, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> call it in the Case of Murth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-Hand.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Back Bearing,</HI> that is, when the Cloth was found on the Person carrying it off.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="385"/>
3 <HI>Tongue Confessing,</HI> that part needs no farther Explanation.</P>
<P>This being the Case, if the Criminal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws taken, he was brought before the Magistrates of the Town, who at that time were only a <HI>Baily</HI> and the <HI>Eoalder∣men,</HI> how many we do not read, and these were to judge, and sentence, and execute the Offender, or clear him, with∣in to many Days; I think it was three Market Days if the Offence was com∣m <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted out of the Vicarage, but within the Bounds of the Forest then there were <HI>Frith Borges</HI> also to judge of the Fact, who were to be summoned of the <HI>Forest H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lders,</HI> as they are called, who were to hold of that Frith, that is, of the Forest; but those were to be good and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men, and by the Magistrates of the Town to be approved as such; if those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quitted him of the Fact he was im∣mediately discharged; if those censured <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Body could reprieve him but the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own. The Country People were, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms, so terrified at the severity of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roceeding, that hence came that Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l Saving, which was used all over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkshire, viz.
<Q><L>From Hell, Hull, and Hallifax,</L>
<L>Good Lord, delived us,</L></Q></P>
<P>How Hull came to be included in this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I do not find; for they had no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I aw there, as I read of.</P>
<P>The manner of Execution was very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rkable; the Engine indeed is carried <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but the Scaffold on which it stood <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere to this Time, and may <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many Ages; being not a Frame <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood but a square Building of Stone, stone Steps to go up, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it self was made in the following er.</P>
<P>ey tell us of a Custom which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here, in the Case of a Criminal to be executed, viz. that if after ead was laid down, and the sig∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pull out the Pin, he could be so nimble as to snatch out his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> between the pulling out the Pin and the falling down of the Axe, and could get up upon his Feet, jump off of the Scaffold, run down a Hill that lies just before it, and get through the River be∣fore the Executioner could overtake him, and seize upon him, he was to escape; and though the Executioner d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d take him on the other Side the River, he was not to bring him back, at least he was not to be executed.</P>
<P>But as they shewed me the form of the Scaffold, and the weight of the Axe, it was, in my Opinion, next to impossi∣ble, any Man should be so quick eyed as to see the pulling out the Piu, and so quick with his Head, as to snatch it out; yet they tell a Story of one Fel∣low that did it, and was so bold afte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had jumpt off of the Scaffold, and was running down the Hill, with the Executioner at his Heel, to turn about aud call to the People to give him his Hat; that having afterwards jumpt into the River, which is but a little one, and not deep, he stopt, intending to drown the Hangman, if he had come up to him; at which the poor Fellow stopt too, and was afraid to go into the Water to seize him. But this Story is said to be too long ago to have any Vouchers, though the People indeed all receive it for Truth.</P>
<P>The force of this Engine is so strong, the Head of the Axe being loaded with a weight of Lead to make it fall heavy, and the Execution is so sure, that it takes away all possibility of its failing to cut off the Head; and to this Purpose, the Hallifax People tell you another Story of a Country Woman, who was riding by upon her Dossers or Hampers to Hal∣lifax Market▪ for the Execution was al∣ways on a Market Day (the third after the Fact) and passing just as the Axe was let fall upon the Neck of the Crimi∣minal, it chopt it thro' with snch Force,
<PB REF="386"/>
that the Head jumpt off into one of her Hampers, and the Woman not perceiving it, she carry'd it away to the Market.</P>
<P>All the use I shall make of this unlike∣ly Story, is this, that it seems Evecuti∣ous were so frequent, that it was not thought a Sight worth the Peoples run∣ning out to see; that the Woman should ride along so close to the Scaffold, and that she should go on, and not so much as stop to see the Axe fall, or take any notice of it. But those Difficulties seem to be much better solved, by saying, that 'tis as reasonable to think the whole Tale is a little Yorkshire, which, I suppose, you will understand well enough.</P>
<P>This Engine was removed, as we are told, in the Year 1620, during the Reign of King James the First, and the Usage and Custom of Prosecution abolished, and Criminals or Felons left to the ordinary Course of Justice, as it is still; and yet they do not find the stealing Cloth from the Tenters is so frequent now as it was in those Times.</P>
<P>But the manner of Execution is pre∣serv'd; for in the Reign of the same Prince, the Earl Morton, Regent or Prime Minister of Scotland, under King James, passing thro' Hallifax, and seeing one of their Executions, was so pleased with the Performance, that he caused a Model to be taken and c rried into Scotland, where it is preserved and constantly made use of for Executions to this Day. But one Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust not be forgotten in this part of the Story, namely, that his Lord∣ship's own Head was the first that was cut off with it; and it being many Years before that happened, the Engine was called the Maiden, as not having so long hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell'd, and still retains the Name, tho' it has cut off many a Head since that.</P>
<P>We quitted Hallifax not without some Astonishment at its Situation, being so surrounded with Hills, and those so high, as (except the Entrance by the West) makes the coming in and going out of it exceeding troublesome, and indeed for Carriages hardly practicable, and parti∣cularly the Hill which they go up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come out of the Town Eastwards <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wards Leeds, and which the Country People call Hallifax Bank, is so sle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rugged, and sometimes too so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that, to a Town of so much Business <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this is, 'tis exceeding troublesome <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dangerous.</P>
<P>From Hallifax it is twelve M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les to Leeds North East, and about <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Wakefield; due East, or a little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> between Hallifax and Leeds <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Town called Burstall. Here t e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Salloon Trade being, a it were, confined to Hallifax, and the Towns al∣ready named, of Hutherfield <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd Brad∣forth, they begin to make Broad Cloth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I call it Broad, in distinction from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies and Druggets, and such Things, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Cloths in this Country are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Narrow, when they are spoken of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> London, and compared with the Broad Cloths made in Wilts, Gloucester, S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣set and Devonshire, of which I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in former Letters.</P>
<P>This Town is famed for Dying, and they make a Sort of Cloths here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Gloucester White Cloths bought for the Dutch and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trades; and though their Cloths here may not be as fine, they told us th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Colours are as good But that is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Business to dispute, the West Country Clothiers deny it; and so I leave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I find it.</P>
<P>From hence to Leeds, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Right-hand and the Left, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appears busy, diligent, and even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hurry of Work, they are not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and dispersed as in the Vica idge of Hal∣lifax, where the Houses stand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by one; but in Villages, those Villages large<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> full of Houses, and those Houses <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with People, for the whole Country is infinitely populous.</P>
<P>A noble Scene of Industry and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is spread before you h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and which, joined to the Market at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where it chiefly centers, is su h a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thing, that they who have pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nded
<PB REF="387"/>
to give an Account of Yorkshire, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave left this out, must betray an Ignor∣ance not to be accounted for, or excused; us what is well worth the Curiosity of a Stranger to go on purpose to see; and and many Travellers and Gentlemen have come over from Hamburgh, nay, even from Leipsick in Saxony, on purpose to see it.</P>
<P>And this broüght me from the Vil∣lages where this Manufacture is wrought, to the Market where it is sold, which is at Leeds.</P>
<P>Leeds is a large, wealthy and populous Town, it stands on the North Bank of the River Aire, or rather on both Sides the River, for there is a large Suburb or Part of the Town on the South Side of the River, and the whole is joined by a stately and prodigiously strong Stone Bridge, so large, and so wide, that for∣merly the Cloth Market was kept in neit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er Part of the Town, but on the very Bridge it self; and therefore the Re∣freshment given the Clothiers by the Inn∣keepers, of which I shall speak presently, is called the Brigg shot to this Day.</P>
<P>The Encrease of the Manufacturers and of the Trade, soon made the Market too great to be confined to the Brigg or Bridge, and it is now kept in the High∣street, beginning from the Bridge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up North almost to the Market-Hou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ where the ordinary Market for Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sions begins, which also is the great∣est of its kind in all the North of Eng∣land▪ except Hallifex, of which I have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poken already, stay, the People a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Leeds will not allow me to except Hallifex, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y▪ that theirs is the greatest Market, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot the greatest Plenty only, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the best of all Kinds of Provisions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ought hither</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is not the Case; it is the Cloth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> now to describe, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Prodigy of its Kind, and is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alled in the World. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rges at Exeter is indeed a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing, and the Value sold there is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but then the Market there is but once a Week, here it is twice a Week, and the Quantity of Goods vast∣ly great too.</P>
<P>The Market it self is worth describing, tho' no Description can come up to the Thing it self; however, take a Sketch of it with its Customs and Usages as fol∣lows:</P>
<P>The Street is a large, broad, fair and well-built<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Street, beginning, as I have said, at the Bridge, and ascending gently to the North▪</P>
<P>Early in the Morning, there are Tres∣sels placed in two Rows in the Street▪ sometimes two Rows on a Side, but al∣ways one Row at least; then there are Boards laid cross those Tressels, so that the Boards lie like long Counters on ei∣ther Side, from one end of the Street to the other.</P>
<P>The Clothiers come early in the Morn∣ing with their Cloth; and as few Clothi∣ers bring more than one Piece, the Mar∣ket being so frequent, they go into the Inns and Publick Houses with it, and there set it down.</P>
<P>At seven a Clock in the Morning, the Clothiers being supposed to be all come by that time, even in the Winter, but the Hour is varried as the Seasons advance (in the Summer earlier, in the Depth of Winter a li tle later) I take it, at a Medi∣um, and as it was when I was there, at six or seven, I say, the Market Bell rings▪ it would surprize a Stranger to see in how few Minutes, without hurry or noise, and not in the least disorder, the whole Mar∣ket is fill'd; all the Boards upon the Tressels are covered with Cloth, close to one another as the Pieces can lie long ways by one another, and behind every Piece of Cloth, the Clothier standing to sell it.</P>
<P>This indeed is not so difficult, when we consider that the whole Quantity is brought into the Market as soon as one Piece, because as the Clothiers stand rea∣dy in the Inns and Shops just behind▪ and that there is a Clothier to every Piece▪ they have no more to do but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a
<PB REF="388"/>
Regiment drawn up in Line, every one takes up his Piece, and has about five steps to march to lay it upon the first Row of Boards, and perhaps ten to the second Row; so that upon the Market Bell ringing, in half a quarter of an Hour the whole Market is fill'd, the Rows of Boards cover'd, and the Clothiers stand ready.</P>
<P>As soon as the Bell has done Ring∣ing, the Merchants and Factors, and Buy∣ers of all Sorts, come down, and com∣ing along the Spaces between the Rows of Boards, they walk up the Rows, and down as their Occasions direct. Some of them have their foreign Letters of Orders, with Patterns seal'd on them, in Rows, in their Hands; and with those they match Colours, holding them to the Cloths as they think they agree to: When they see any Cloths to their Co∣lours▪ or that suit their Occasions, they reach over to the Clothier and whisper, and in the fewest Words imaginable the Price is stated; one asks, the other bids; and 'tis agree, or not agree, in a mo∣ment.</P>
<P>The Merchants and Buyers generally walk down and up twice on each Side of the Rows, and in little more than an Hour all the Business is done; in less than half an Hour you will pereeive the Cloths begin to move off, the Clothier <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aking it up upon his Shoulder to carry it to the Merchant's House; and by half an hour after eight a Clock the Market Bell rings again; immediately the Buyers dis∣appear, the Cloth is all sold, or if here and there a Piece happens not to be bought, '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is carried back into the Inn, and, in a quarter of an Hour, there is not a Peice of Cloth to be seen in the Market.</P>
<P>Thus, you see, Ten or Twenty thou∣sand Pounds value in Cloth, and some∣times much more, bought and sold in little more than an Hour, and the Laws of the Market the most strictly observed as ever I saw done in any Market in Eng∣land; for,</P>
<P N="1">1. Before the Market Bell rings, no Man shews a Piece of Cloth, nor can the Clotheirs sell any but in open Mar∣ket.</P>
<P N="2">2. After the Market Bell rings again, no Body stays a Moment in the Market, but carried his Cloth back if it be not sold.</P>
<P N="3">3. And that which is most admirable is, 'tis all managed with the most pro∣found Silence, and you cannot hear a Word spoken in the whole Market, I mean, by the Persons buying and selling; 'tis all done in whisper.</P>
<P>The reason of this Silence, is chiefly because the Clothiers stand so near to one another; and 'tis always reasonable that one should not know what another does, for that would be discovering their Bu∣siness, and exposing it to one another.</P>
<P>If a Merchant has bidden a Clothier a Price, and he will not take it, he may go after him to his House, and tell him he has considered of it, and is willing to let him have it; but they are not to make any new Agreement for it, so as to remove the Market from the Street to the Merchants House.</P>
<P>By nine a Clock the Boards are ta∣ken down, the Tressels are removed, and the Street cleared, so that you see no Market or Goods any more than if there had been nothing to do; and this is done twice a Week.</P>
<P>If you should ask upon all this, where all these Go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, as well here as at Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣field, and at Hallifax, are vented and dis∣posed of? It would require a long Trea∣tise of Commerce to enter into that Part. But that I may not bring you into the Labyrinth, and not show you the way out. I shall, in three short Heads, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Consumption, for there are three Chan∣nels by which it goes:</P>
<P N="1">1. For the home Consumption; their Goods being, as I may say, every where made use of, for the cloathing the or∣dinary People, who cannot go to the Price of the fine Medley Cloaths made, as I formerly gave you an Account, in

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Western Counties of England. There <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for this purpose a Set of travelling Merchants in Leeds, who go all over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngland with Droves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Pack-Horses, and to all the Fairs and Market Towns over the whole Island, I think I may say none excepted. Here they supply not the common People by Retail, which would denominate them Pedlars indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut they supply the Shops by Wholesale or whole Peices; and not only so, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he large Credit too, so that they are really travelling Merchants, and as such they sell a very great Quantity of Goods; 'tis ordinary for one of these Men to car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a thousand Pounds value of Cloth with them at a time, and having sold it at the Fairs or Towns where they go▪ they send their Horses back for as much more, and th s very often in a Summer, for they chuse to travel in the Summer, and perhaps towards the Winter time, tho' as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Winter as they can, because of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Roads.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another sort of Buyers are those who buy to send to London; either by Commissions from London, or they give Commissions to Factors and Warehouse-keepers in London to sell for them; and the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e drive also a very great Trade: The<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Factors and Warehouse-keepers not only <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upply all the Shop keepers Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Men in London, but sell also very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Quantities to the Merchants, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for Exportation to the English <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in America which take off <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of those course Goods, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> New England, New York, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> as also to the Russia <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who send and exceeding Quantity Petersburgh, R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ga, Dantzick, Narva, to Sweden and Pomerania.</P>
<P>The third sort of Buyers, and who no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less considerable than the other, truly Merchants, that is to say, such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceive Commissions from Abroad to Cloth for the Merchants in Ham∣burgh, and in Holland, and from several other Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and these are not only many in Number, but some of them are very considerable in their Dealings, and cor∣respond as far as Nuremberg, Frankfort, Leipsick, and even to Vienna and Aus∣burgh, in the farthest Provinces of Ger∣many.</P>
<P>On Account of this Trade it was, that some Years ago an Act of Parliament was obtained for making that Rivers Aire and Calder Navigable; by which a Communi∣cation by Water was opened from Leeds and Wakefield to Hull, and by which means all the Woollen Manufactures which those Merchants now export by Commis∣sion, as above, is carried by Water to Hull, and there shipped for Holland, Bre∣men, Hamburgh, and the Baltick. And thus you have a brief Account, by what Methods this vast Manufacture is carried off, and which way they find a Vent for it.</P>
<P>There is another Trade in this Part of the Country, which is now become very considerable since the opening the Navi∣gation of these Rivers, and that is, that from hence they carry Coals down from Wakefield (especially) and also from Leeds, at both which they have a very great Quantity, and such, as they told me, could never be exhausted. These they carry quite down into the Humber, and then up the Ouse to York, and up the Trent, and other Rivers, where there are abundance of large Towns, who they supply with Coals; with this Advantage too, that whereas the Newcastle Coals pay four Shillings per Chaldron Duty to the Publick; these being only called Ri∣ver Borne Coal, are exempted, and pay nothing; though, strictly speaking, they are carried on the Sea too, for the Hum∣ber is properly the Sea. But they have been hitherto exempted from the Tax, and so they carry on the Trade to their very great Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P><PB REF="390"/>
I need not add, that by the same Na∣vigation they receive all their heavy Goods, as well such as are imported at Hull, as such as come from London, and such as other Counties supply, as Butter, Cheese, Lead, Iron, Salt; all Sorts of Grocery, as Sugars, Tobacco, Fruit, Spice, Hops, &amp;c. Oyl, Wine, Brandy, Spirits, and eve∣ry Sort of heavy or bulky Goods,</P>
<P>The Town of Leeds is very large, and, as above, there are abundance of wealthy Merchants in it. Here are two Churches, and two large Meeting-Houses of Dissenters, and six or seven Chapels of Ease, besides Dissenters Chapels, in the adjacent, depending Villages; so that Leeds may not be much inferior to Hal∣lifax in Numbers of People: It is really a surprising Thing to see what Numbers of People are thronged together in all the Villages about these Towns, and how busy they all are, being fully employed in this great Manufacture.</P>
<P>Before I go forward from hence, I should tell you, that I took a little trip to see the antient Town of Pontefract, with that dismal Place called the Castle, a Place that was really dismal on many Accounts, having been a Scene of Blood in many sevel Ages; for here Henry, the great Earl of Lancaster, who was at the same time Lord of the Castle, and whose Ancestors had beautified and en∣larged it exceedingly, and fortified it too, was beheaded, in King Edward the IId's time, with three or four more of the English Barons. Here Richard IId, be∣ing deposed and imprisoned, was barba∣roufly murthered, and, if History lies not, in a cruel manner; and here Anthony, Earl Rivers, and Sir Richard Gray, the first Uncle, and the last Brother in law to King Edward the Fifth, were beheaded by that Tyrant Richard III. Here, in the late Wars, a small Party of brave Fellows took the Castle, by surprise, for the King, and having desperately defend∣ed it to the last Extremity, and being o∣bliged to yield, five of them attempted to break thro the Besiegers Camp, three of whom perished in the Attempt.</P>
<P>The Town is large and well built, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much smaller than it has been; the Cast lies in its Ruin, tho' not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> within a Mile of it is Ferry Bridge, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> there is a great Stone Bridge over the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Calder (then united) and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stone Causeway, above a Mile in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a Town call'd Brotherton, where Queen Margaret, Wife of King Edward the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was delivered of a Son, being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as she was abroad taking the Air, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Histories say, a Hunting; but, I must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it seems not very probable.

comes down from the Hills also, as the rest do.</P>
<P>But I must go back to Pontefract, to take notice, that here again the great Roman Highway, which I mentioned at Doncaster, and which is vislble from thence in several Places on the Way to Ponte∣fract, though not in the open Road, is apparent again, and from Castleford Bridge, which is another Bridge over the united Rivers of Aire and Calder, it goes on to Abberforth, a small Market Town famous for Pin making, ane so to Tadcaster and York. But I mention it here on this pre∣sent Occasion, for otherwise these Re∣mains of Antiquity are not my Province in this Undertaking; I say, 'tis on this Occasion.</P>
<P N="1">1. That in some Places this Causeway being cut into and broken up, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Care of the Romans for making firm Causeways for the Convenience of Car∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and for the passing of Travellers; is to be seen there. The Layings of dif∣ferent Sorts of Earth, as Clay at the bot∣tom. Chalk upon that, then Gravel upon the Chalk, then Stones upon the Gravel, and then Gravel again; and so of other kinds of Earth, where the first was not to be had.</P>
<P N="2">2. In some Places between this Bridge and Town of Abberforth, the Causeway having not be n used for the ordinary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it lies as fair and untouch'd, the Surf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce cov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red with Turf, smooth as at it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first making, not so much as the Mark of a Hoof or a Wheel upon it; so that it is to be seen in its full Dimensions and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as if it had been made but the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Week; whereas 'tis very probable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t had stood so fifteen or sixteen hundred Y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and I take notice of it here, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have not seen any thing like it in any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her Place in England, and because <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People, who are now mending the Roads almost every where; might take a Pattern from it.</P>
<P>As I made this little Excursion to see the Town of Pontefract from Leeds, you must suppose me now retuned thither, and setting out thence Northward. I had no sooner pass'd out of the District of Leeds about four or five Miles, and pass'd the Wharse▪ at a fine Stone Bridge of eleven Arches, at a little pretty Town called Harwood; I say, I was no sooner gotten hither, but it was easie to see we were out of the Manufacturing Country. Now the black moorish Lands, like Black-Barnsley, shew'd dismal again and right∣ful, the Towns# were thin, and thin of People too; we saw but little enclosed Ground, no Tenters with the Cloths shining upon them, nor People busied within Doors, as before; but, as in the Vicaridge, we saw inhabited Mountains, here we saw waste and almost uninhabited Vales.</P>
<P>In a word, the Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry look'd as i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the People were transplanted to Leeds and Hallifax, and that here was only a few just left at home to cultivate the Land, manage the Plough, and raise Corn for the rest.</P>
<P>The River Wharse seemed very small▪ and the Water low, at Harwood Bridge▪ so that I was surprised to see so fine a Bridge over it, and was thinking of the great Bridge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Madrid over the Mansa∣nares, of which a Frenchman of Quality looking on it, said to the Spaniards that were about him, That the King of Spain ought either to buy them some Water, or they should fell their Bridge: But I was afterwards satisfied that was not the Case here; for coming another time this Way after a heavy Rain, I was convinced the Bridge was not at all too big▪ or too long, the Water filling up to the very Crown of the Arches, and some of the Arches not to be seen at all.</P>
<P>From the Wharfe we went directly North, over a continued waste of black, ill locking, desolate Moors, over which Travellers are guided, like Race Horses▪ by Posts set up for fear of Bogs and Holes, to a Town call'd Ripley, that stands up▪
<PB REF="392"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another River called the Nad by some, by others the Nyd▪ smaller than the Wharfe, but furiously rapid, and very dangerous to pass in many Places, especi∣ally upon sudden Rains Notwithstand∣ing such lofty, high built Bridges as are not to be seen over such small Rivers in any other Place; and, on this Occasion, it may be observed here, once for all, that no Part of England, I may say so because I can say I have seen the whole Island, a very little excepted, I say, no Part can shew such noble, lofty, and long Stone Bridges as this Part of England, nor so many of them; nor do I remember to have seen any such thing as a Timber Bridge in all the Northern Part of England, no not from the Trent to the Tweed; whereas in the South Parts of England there are abundance, as particularly over the great River of Thames at Kingston. Chertsey, Staines, Windsor, Maidenhead, Reading, Henley, Marlow, and other Places, and over the River Lea, tho' a navigable River, of thirteen Bridges, we see <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one built of Stone, (viz.) that at Bow.</P>
<P>A little below Ripley, on the same River Nyd, and with a very fine Bridge over it also, we saw Knaresborough; known among Foreigners by the Name of Knares∣borough Spaw; in the South of England I have heard it call'd the Yorkshire Spaw. I shall not enter here upon the definition of the Word Spaw, 'tis enough to speak familiarly, that here is a Well of Physical or Mineral Waters, or, to speak more ex∣actly as one viewing the Country, here are at the Town, and in the adjacent Lands, no less than four Spaws or Mine∣ral Waters.</P>
<P>The first thing recommended to me for a Wonder, was that four Spr ngs, the Waters of which are in themselves of so different a Quality, should rise in so nar∣row a compass of Ground; but I, who was surfeited with County Wonders in my passing the Peak, was not so easily surprized at the wonderful strangenss of this Part; and when my Landsord at Knaresborough took me short, with a <HI>But is it not a strange thing, Sir?</HI> I answered him with a Question, Is it not as strange, Sir, said I, that in De<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>byshir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Springs, one hot, and another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should rise within a Hand's bread<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one another? 'Tis certain, that though the eruption of Water may be near, yet the subterranean Passages may be as re∣mote as East and West, and the Miner<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l lying in Veins may run remote also▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as to take off all the Wonder.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Springs themselves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one of them, is nothing extra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, namely, that in a little Cave a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Water drops from the Roof of the Ca∣vity, which, as they say, turn▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stone. This indeed I made light of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because I had already been at P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s Hole and Castleton in the Peak, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Harwich.</P>
<P>But new to speak of the other two Springs, they are indeed valuable Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ties, and not to be equalled in Eng∣land.</P>
<P N="1">1.

Paraletic Numbnesses, and many other Distempers which afflict Mankind.</P>
<P>We were surprised to find a great deal of good Company here drinking the Wa∣ters, and indeed, more than we found afterwards at Scarborough; though this seems to be a most desolute out of-the-way Place, and that Men would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> retire to it for religious Mortifications, and to hate the World, but we found it was quite otherwise.</P>
<P>These two Bridges at Harwood and Ripley are very firm, fine, and, I assure you, very chargeable Work. It is true, a Bridge over the same River at Burrow∣brigg, four Miles lower than Rippon, has but four or five Arches, but then those Arches are near forty Foot diameter, and one of the middlemost much more, and high in proportion, and the ends of the Bridge continued by high Causeways, built of Stone, to keep the Water in its Course; and yet sometimes all is too lit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le.</P>
<P>From the Bridges may be observ'd, that however low these Waters are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummer, they are high and furious enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Winter; and yet the River Aire, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' its beginning is in the same Ridge of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountains as the other, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hill called Penigent, which over∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps all its Neighbours; I say, this Ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r is gentle and mild in its Stream, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e other are all raging and furious; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly Reason I can give for it, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wever I think is a very just Account, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that it runs in a thousand Windings <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Turnings more than any other Ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r in those Parts; and these Reaches <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meanders of the River greatly help check the sharpness of the Stream: The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reason is, that after it has descended <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Mountains it has a deeper <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both which, I think▪ put together, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficiently account for the abating <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Current.</P>
<P>Rippon is a very near, pleasant, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town, and has not only an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Situation on a rising Ground be∣tween two Rivers, but the Market Place is the finest and most beautiful Square that is to be seen of its kind in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>In the middle of it stand a curious Column of Stone, imitating the Obelisks of the Ancients, tho' not so high, but rather like the Pillar in the middle of Covent Garden, or that in Lincoln's Inn, with Dials also upon it.</P>
<P>But I must not omit to tell you also, however other pretended travelling Writers were not to see it as they went by, that here is a large Collegiate Church, and tho' it is not a Bishoprick but a Deanary only, in the Diocess of York, yet it is a very handsome, ancient and venerable Pile of Building, and shews it self a great way in the Country. Mr. Cambden says, this Town of Rippon owes its Greatness to Religion.</P>
<P>That here was a famous Monastery built by Wilfred, Archbishop of York, and that in the first Ages of Christiani∣ty, at least in this Island, is certain; but this pious Gift of the Bishop was swal∣lowed up some Years after, when the Danes over-running Yorkshire, rifled and burnt it to the Ground, as likewise the whole Town of Rippon: It afterwards flourished again as a Monastery. But those being all given up in the Reign of King Henry VIII the Church only was preserved. Mr Cambden says it was built, which I conceive rather to be form'd into a Church, from the Ruin of the Monastery, by the Contribution of the Gentry thereabours.</P>
<P>While it was a Monastery, here was a famous Sanctuary, a Thing however use∣ful in some Cases, yet so abused in foreign, Countries, by making the Church a Re∣fuge of Rogues, Thieves and Murther∣ers, that 'tis happy for England it is out of use here. This Privilege of Sanctuary was it

seems, granted to the Church of Rippon by King Athelstan, An. and with this extraordinary Sanction, that whosoever broke the Rights of Sanctuary of the Church of Rippon, and which he extend∣ed to a Mile on either Side the Church, should forfeit Life and Estate; so that, in short, not the Church only, but the whole Town, and a Circle of two Miles diameter, was like the Rules of the King's Bench here in Southwark, a Refuge for all that sled to it, where they liv'd safe from all manner of Molestation, even from the King, or his Laws, or any Per∣son whatsoever.</P>
<P>Annexed to this Monastery was an Hospital, the Intent and Purpose of which are very remarkable, and would be wor∣thy imitation in our Days of Protestant Charity, when indeed I see nothing come up to it. The House was called the Hospital of St. Mary Magdalen, where, according to the Foundation, were to be maintained two Chaplains to perform Divine Service; and if any begging Clergyman, or other needy Persons, should happen to travel or stray out of their Way, and call at the said Hospital, they should be relieved there for one Night only, with Food and a Bed, and to be gone in the Morning; and to every poor Person that came craving an Alms, on St. Mary Magdalen's Day yearly, they should give one Loaf, value a half Peny, when Corn was at the Price of five Shillings per Quarter, and one Her∣ring.</P>
<P>Also 'tis recorded, that one Branch of this Hospital was founded and endowed, and given to a Society of religious Sisters by a certain Archbishop of York. But the Inquisition taken does not find his Name, to the intent that they▪ should maintain one Chaplain to perform Divine Service, and to the farther intent that they should maintain all the Lepers born and bred in Hipschire, that should come to it for Maintenance; and that they should allow to each of them a Garment called Rak, and two pair of Shoes year∣ly, with every Day a Loaf fit for a poor Man's sustenance, half a Pitcher of Beer, a sufficient Portion of Flesh on F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esh Days, and three Herrings on Fish Days.</P>
<P>After this, other Gifts were added to this Foundation; also the Sisters were re∣moved, and a Brotherhood established in their stead, which continued some time; and after that a Mastership; and the Main∣tenance of Lepers finding no Clients, the Country proving healthy, that part was turned into a Charity, to be dealt out to the Poor on St. Mary Magdalen's Day, as above, At length all was demolished to∣gether, and the House, with the Monas∣tery, suppress'd, as it now stands, a Col∣legiate Church being erected on the Place of it: Besides, it seems upon another In∣quisition, and a Jury empanelled to give their Verdict, it appeared in the 10th of Edward III. that the Revenue of one Branch of the Hospital had been embez∣zled and squandered away by the Master of the Hospital, the Charities interrupt∣ed, and the Poor defrauded.</P>
<P>And so in the Visitation of the Church, for it seems there were Frauds and Embez∣zlements in those Days, even of the Goods of the Church, as well as since▪ Mr. Dugdale, in his Monasticon, gives an Account, that William, Archbishop of York, in a Visitation of the Church of Rippon, Anno 1331. found it almost a∣bandoned, notwithstanding much Cure of Souls depended on it; that there were good Revenues belonging to it, but that they were consumed by the absent Can∣ons. N. B. There was then also Non-Residence, and the Non Residents too de∣vouring the Goods of the Church.</P>
<P>Upon this, the good Archbishop took order for the future, that all the Lands, Meadows, Revenues and Services (I give you the very Words of the Archbishop's Decree upon his Visitation) with the Tithes of Garbs and Hay, of Nyd and Grantilaye, with a Pension of twenty Shillings due from the Vicar of Nyd, and the spiritual Jurisdiction, and the Profits of the same, should, for the future, be
<PB REF="397"/>
divided among those who should re∣side at the Church of Rippon, and no other.</P>
<P>There were at that time, in this Church, nine Chanteries, besides two Out-Chan∣teries in the Parish, the same which we call now Chapels of Ease; and besides the Chantery of the two Priests in the Hospital, the Out-Chanteries were one at Hutton Conyers, and one at Clother∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m N B.

<P>These were noble Stipends in those Days. How our Clergy would serve at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Time under such great Encourage∣ment, is left to Enquiry, especially the Organist's Salary was notable; from thence I may, I hope without offence, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppose, that he being a Layman, might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Business in the Town, (perhaps he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as a Dancing-Master, or a Musick-Mas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, or both<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to teach the young Ladies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Rippon; and his Wife might keep a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oarding School too; and so the Gram∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar School master might be a Writing-Master in the Town, and the like.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, the Church is still <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anding, tho' the Monastery and Hospital <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e suppressed, and the Canons and Choir <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e maintained at a much better Rate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an as above, for they now eat as good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eef, and drink as good Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kshire Ale, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their Neighbours.</P>
<P>It is an antient Building, but firm and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rong, the work Gothick, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Times, and plain; no Imagery or Sta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of any Note to be seen about it; there are three homely Spires, one on the Tower in the middle, and the other two on the Angle Towers of the West End; they are covered with Lead, but not very high or hansom.</P>
<P>But I must not leave Rippon without giving the fam'd Tale of St. Wilfrid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Needle. St. Wilfrid was the Saint to whom the Monastery was dedicated, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Needle was, it seems, for the trial of Charity. There was a dark Vault under Ground in one Part of the Monastery, into which there was an easy Passing one Way, but a narrow long En<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y▪ also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> uneven to come out of it: If <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty was suspected, it d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> not say whether it was not for Men as well as Women but to be sure it was for the latter, they were put into this Vault, and the first Entrance being clos∣ed, they were at liberty to come out by the other, which was called the Needle, or the Eye of the Needle; if they were chaste and untainted, they came out boldly, and without any difficulty; but if faulty, they were stopp'd▪ and could not get along in the narrow Eye or Pas∣sage, and, as I think the Story says, were left there, unable to get out till they had confessed their Fault. Whether the Priests had no Craft in this Case, to put some secret Barrier cross the nartow Passage in the dark, so to impose upon the poor Girls that were put to the trial, that I am not to enquire too far into: However it was, the Priests made a Miracle of it; and the poor Yorkshire Lasses have, no doubt, good reason to be satisfied that St. Wilfred has left off showing those mira∣culous Things at this time.</P>
<P>In the Churchyard of this Minster lies a plain Monument or Gravestone over the Remains of a generous Soul, who, in Charity, gave Two thousand Pounds to pious Uses; the modest Epitaph is, how∣ever, very important, as follows:</P>
<P>Hic jacet <HI>Zacharias Jopson,</HI> cujus Aet fuit 49, per pacos annos tantum vixit.</P>

<P>A M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le from this Town, or less▪ is a stately beautiful Seat, built a few Years since by Sir Edward Blacket; the Park is extended to the Bank of the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and is sometimes in part laid under Water by the River, the Water of which, they say, coming down from the Western Mountains, thro' a marly, loamy Soil, fructifies the Earth, as the River Nile <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es the Egyptian Fields about Grand Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro tho' by their leave not quite so much.</P>
<P>As Sir Edward spared no Cost in the B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lding, and Sir Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istopher Wren laid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Design, as well as chose the Ground for him, you may believe me the better, when I add, that nothing can either add to the Contrivance or the Situation; the Building is of Brick, the Avenues, now the Trees are grown, are very fine, and the Gardens <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only well laid out, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll planted, and as well kept; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are neat, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beautiful; but, as they want fine Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vel, the Walks can∣not shew themselves, as in this Southern Part of England they would. The House has a fine Prospect over the Country, almost to York, with the River in view most of the Way; and it makes it self a very noble Appearance to the great North Road, which lies within two Miles of it, at Burrow bridge.</P>
<P>As you now begin to come into the North Riding▪ for the Eure parts the We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Riding from it, so you are come into the Place noted in the North of England for the best and largest Oxen, and the fines<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> galloping Horses, I mean swift Horses Horses bred, as we call it, for the light Saddle, that is to say, for the Race, the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for Running or Hunting. Sir Edward was a Grazier▪ and took such de∣light in the Breeding and Feeding large siz'd Black Car<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that he had two or three times an Ox out of his Park led about the Country for a Sight, and shewed as far as Newcastle, and even to Scotland, for the biggest Bullock in England; nor was he very often, if ever, over match'd.</P>
<P>From this Town of Rippon, the North Road and the Roman Highway also, men∣tioned before, which comes from Castle∣ford Bridge, part at Abberforth, leads away to a Town call'd Bedal, and, in a strait Line (leaving Richmond about two Miles on the West) call'd Leeming Lane, goes on to Piersbridge on the River Tees, which is the farthest Boundary of the Coun∣ty of York.</P>
<P>But before I go forward I should men∣tion Burrow Bridge, which is but three Miles below Rippon, upon the same Ri∣ver Eure, and which I must take in my Way, that I may not be obliged to go farther out of the Way, on the next Jour∣ney.</P>
<P>There is something very singular at this Town, and which is not to be found in any other Part of England or Scot∣land, namely, two Borough Towns in one Parish, and each sending two Members to Parliament, that is, Borough Brigg and Aldborough.</P>
<P>Borough Brigg, or Bridge, seems to be the modern Town risen up out of Ald∣borough, the very Names importing as much, (viz.) that Burrough at the Bridge,
<PB REF="400"/>
and the Old Borough that was before; and this Construction I pretend to justfy from all the Antiquaries of our Age, or the last; who place on the Side of Ald∣borough or Old Borough, an ancient City and Roman Colony, call'd <HI>Isurium Bri∣gantum;</HI> the Arguments brought to prove the City stood here, where yet at present nothing of a City is to be seen, no not so much as the Ruins, especially not above Ground, are out of my way for the present; only the digging up Coins, Urns, Vaults, Pavements, and the like, may be men∣tioned, because some of them are very eminent and remarkable ones, of which an Account is to be seen at large in Mr. Cambden, and his Continuator, to whom I refer. That this Old Burrough is the Remain of that City, is then out of doubt, and that the Burrough at the Bridge, is since grown up, and perhaps principally by the Confluence of Travel∣lers, to pass the great Bridge over the Eure there; this seems too out of ques∣tion by the import of the Word. How either of them came to the Privilege of sending Members to Parliament, whether by Charter and Incorporation, or meer Prescription, that is to say, a Claim of Age, which we call Time out of Mind, that remains for the Parliament to be satisfied in. Certain it is, that the young∣est of the two, that is, Burrow Bridge, is very old; for here, in the Barons Wars, was a Battle, and on this Bridge the great Bohun, Earl of Hereford, was kil∣led by a Soldier, who lay concealed un∣der the Bridge, and wounded him, by thrusting a Spear or Pike into his Body, as he pass'd the Bridge. From whence Mr. Cambden very gravely judges, that it was not a Stone Bridge as is now, but a Bridge of Timber, a thing any Man might judge without being challenged for a Wizard.</P>
<P>I had not the Curiosity so much as to go to see the four great Stones in the Fields on the Left-hand, as you go thro' Burrow Bridge, which the Country Peo∣ple, because they wonder how they could come there, will have it they were brought by the Devil, and call them the Devil's Bolts. Mr. Camben describes them, and they are no more than are frequent; and I have been oblged to speak of such so often, that I need say no more, but refer to other Authors to describe the Romans Way of setting up Trophics for Victory, or the Dead, or Places of Sa∣crifices to their Gods, and which soever it may be, the Matter is the same.</P>
<P>From the Eure entring the North Rid∣ing, and keeping the Roman Causeway, as mentioned before, one part of which went by this Isurium Brigan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um from York, we came to Bedall, all the Way from Hutton, or thereabout, this Roman way is plain to be seen▪ and is called now Leeming Lane, from Leeming Chapel, a Village which it goes through</P>
<P>I met nothing at or about Bedall, that comes within the compass of my En∣quiry but this, that not this Town only, but even all this Country, is full of Jockeys, that is to say, Dealers in Horses, and Breeders of Horses; and the Breeds of their Horses in this and the next Country are so well known, that tho' they do not preserve the Pedigree of their Horses for a Succession of Ages, as they say they do in Arabia and in Barbary, yet they christen their Stallions here, and know them, and will advance the Price of a Horse according to the Reputation of the Horse he came of.</P>
<P>They do indeed breed very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Horses here, and perhaps some of the best in the World, for let Foreigners boast what they will of Barbs and Turkish Horses, and, as we know five hundred Pounds has been given for a Horse brought out of Turkey, and of the Spanish Jennets from Cordoua, for which also an extravagant Price has been given, I do believe that some of the Gallopers of this Country, and of the Bishoprick of Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ham, which joins to it, will out-do for Speed and Strength the swiftest Horse that was ever bred in Turkey, or Barbary, take them all together▪</P>
<P><PB REF="401"/>
Reason for this Opinion is found∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon those Words altogether; that is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o say, take their Strength and their Speed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether; for example; match the two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orses, and bring them to the Race Post, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Barb may beat Yorkshire for a Mile Courle, but Yorkire shall Distance him at the end of four Miles; the Barb shall beat Yorkshire upon a dry, soft Carpet Ground, but Yorkshire for a deep Coun∣ty; the Reason is plain, the English Horses have both the Speed and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trength; the Barb perhaps shall beat Yorkshire, and carry seven Stone and a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alf: but Yorkshire for a twelve to 14 tone weight; in a word, Yorkshire shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the Man, and the Barb a Feather.</P>
<P>The reason is to be seen in the very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake of the Horses. The Barb, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onet, is a sine delicate Creature, of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>autiful Shape, clean Limbs, and a soft <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at; but then he is long jointed, weak <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tured, and under limb'd: Whereas <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orkshire has as light a Body, and stron∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Limbs, short Joints, and well Bon'd. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is gives him not Speed only but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength to hold it; and, I believe, I do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> boast in their behalf, without good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chers, when I say, that English Hor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take them one with another, will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the World.</P>
<P>As this Part of the Country is so much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loyed in Horses, the young Fellows naturally Grooms, bred up in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, and used to lie among the Horses; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat you cannot fail of a good Servant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for looking after Horses is their par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar Delight; and this is the Reason <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whatever Part of England you go though the farthest Counties West South, and whatever Inn you come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is two to one but the Hostler is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shire Man; for as they are bred a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Horses, 'tis always the first Busi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they recommend themselves to; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u ask a Yorkshire Man, at his first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng up to get a Service, what he can his answer is, Sir, he can look after Horse, for he handles a Curry-Comb as naturally as a young Serivener does a Pen and Ink.</P>
<P>Besides their Breeding of Horses, they are also good Grasiers over this whole Country, and have a large, noble Breed of Oxen, as may be seen at North Al∣lerton Fairs, where there are an incredi∣ble Quantity of them bought eight times every Year, and brought Southward as far as the Fens in Lincolnshire and the I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of Ely, where, being but, as it were, half fat before, they are fed up to the grossness of Fat which we see in London Markets. The Market whether these North Country Cattle are generally brought is to St. Ives, a Town between Huntington and Cambridge, upon the River Ouse, and where there is a very great Number of far Cattle every Mon∣day.</P>
<P>Richmond, which, as I said, is two or three Mile wide of the Leeming Lane, is a large Market Town, and gives Name to this Part of the Country, which is called after it Richmondshire, as another Part of it East of this is called North Al∣lertonshire.</P>
<P>Here you begin to find a Manufacture on Foot again, and▪ as before, all was Cloathing, and all the People Clothiers, here you see all the People, great and small, a Knitting; and at Richmond you have a Market for Woollen or Yarn Stockings, which they make very coarse and ordinary, and they are sold accord∣ingly; for the smallest siz'd Stockings for Childran are here sold for eighteen Pence per dozen, or three half Pence a pair, sometimes less.</P>
<P>This Trade extends itself also into Westmore-land, or rather comes from Westmore-land, extending itself hither, for at Kendal, Kirkby, Stephen, and such other Places in this County as border up∣on Yorkshire; the chief Manufacture of Yarn Stockings is carried on; it is indeed a very considerable Manufacture in it it self, and of late mightily encreased too, is all the Manufactures of England in∣deed are.</P>

This Town of Richmond (Cambden call'd it a City) is wall'd, and had a strong Castle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but as those Things are now all flighte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u really the Account of them is of small consequence, and needless; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld Fortifications being, if Fortification was wanted, of very little signification; the River Swale runs under the Wall of this Castle, and has some unevenness at its Bottom, by reason of Rocks which in∣rercept its Passage, so that it falls like a Cataract▪ but not with so great a Noise.</P>
<P>The Swale is a noted River, though not extraordinary large, for giving Name to the Lands which it runs through for some Length which are called S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale Dale, and to an ancient Family of that Name, one of whom had the Vanity, as I have heard, to boast that his Family was so ancient as not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceive that Name from, but to give Name to the River itself. One of the worthless Successors of this Line, who had brought himself to the Dignity of what they call in London, a Fleeter, used to write himself, in his abun∣dant Vanity, Sir Solomon Swale, of Swale Hall, in Swale Dale, in the County of Swale in the North Riding of York.</P>
<P>This addition of Dale, first given here to the low Lands about the Head of the Swale, is grown up into a Custom or Usage from all the Rivers which rise in those Western Hills North of this, quite to and into Scotland; for example,</P>
<P>Teesdale for the River Tees.</P>
<P>Wierdale for the Wier, which runs through Durham.</P>
<P>Tine Dale for the Tine, which runs to Newcastle.</P>
<P>Tweedale for the Tweed, which passeth by Berwick.</P>
<P>Cly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dale Nydsdale, and many others.</P>
<P>Leaving Richmond, we continue through this long Leeming Lane, which holds for about the length of six Miles to the Bank of Tees, where we pass'd over the Ri∣ver Tees at Piersbridge; the Tees is a most terrible River, so rapid, that they tell us a Story of a Man who coming to the Ferry Place in the Road to Dar∣lington, and finding the Water low be∣gan to pull of his Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Shoes to wade thro', the Water not Long deep enough to reach to his K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ees, but that while he was going over, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swell'd so fast as to carry him away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and drown him.</P>
<P>This Bridge leads into the Bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of Durham, and the Road soon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the great Post-Road <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the City of Durham I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> longer upon the Particulars to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Side except Barnard Castle, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> four Miles distant from the Tees <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> West, and there I may speak of it age as all the Country round here are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as is noted before; so here and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abouts they have an excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dressing Horses Hides into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thinking or making us think it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is to say, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> wear out; in a word, they make the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bridle Reins, Belts broad or narrow▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all Accoutrements for a compleat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> master, as they do at Rippon for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Stirrups.</P>
<P>Bernard's Castle stands on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Side of the Tees, and so is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shoprick of Durham. 'Tis an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town, and pretty well built, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> large; the Manufacture of Yarn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continues thus far, but not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> farther; but the Jockeys multiply <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way; and here we saw some very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Horses indeed; but as they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Goodness, so they wanted no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> valued for the Stallion they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the merit of the Breed. One <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beautiful Stone-horse which they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kept, they asked two hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for; but, as I heard afterwards, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> carried him to London, which was small addition to the Charge of him, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sold him for much less Money.</P>
<P>The length of the late War, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> caused the Breeders here to run <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> race or kind of Horses, differing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from what they were used to raise, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is to say, from fine fleet Horses for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> loping and Hunting, to a larger <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="403" MS="y"/>
Charging Horses, for the Use of the Ge∣neral Officers, and Colonels of Horse, Aids du Camp, and the like, whose Ser∣vice required strong Charging Horses, and yet if they were fleet Horses too, they had a vast Advantage of the Enemy; for that if the Rider was conquered and forced to fly, there was no overtaking him; and if his Enemies fled they could never get away from him. I saw some of this Breed, and very noble Creatures they were, fit for any Business whatever; strong enough for Charging, fleet enough for Hunting, tempered enough for Tra∣velling; and indeed, there is one thing to be said for the Horse Breeders in this Country, their Horses are all well broke, perfectly brought to Hand, and to be un∣der Command, which is a thing absolutely necessary in the Army, and in the Hunt∣ing Field also.</P>
<P>I was come now to the extent of the County of York Northward. But as I have kept all along to the West Side of the Country, even from the Peak of Darby hither; and that I have all the East Riding and the Eastern Part of the North and West Riding to go over, I shall break off here.</P>
<TRAILER>The <HI>END</HI> of the <HI>8</HI>th <HI>JOURNEY,</HI></TRAILER>
</DIV2>

<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY IX.</HEAD>
<P>I Began my eight Journey at the Bank of Trent, namely, at Nottingham-Bridge, and keeping the middle of the Island, travelled due Not<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> West Riding of Yorkshire, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he farthest Part of the Country to the Bank of Tees, as you have seen.</P>
<P>I am now come back, as the French say, <HI>sur mes pas,</HI> to the same Bank of the Trent, though lower down, towards the East and shall gather up some Frag∣ments of Nottinghamshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, as I go, and then hasten to the Sea Side, where we have not not cast our Eye yet.</P>
<P>Passing Newark Bridge we went through the lower Side of Nottinghamshire, keep∣ing within the River Idle. Here we saw Tuxford in the Clays, that is to say, Tuxford in the Dirt, and a little dirty Market Town it is, suitable to its Name.</P>
<P>Then we saw Rhetford, a pretty lit∣tle Borough Town of good Trade▪ situate on the River Idle; the Mayor treated us like Gentlemen, though himself but a Tradesman; he gave us a Dish of Fish from the River Idle, and another from the Trent, which I only note, to inti∣mate that the Salmon of the Trent is very valuable in this Country, and is of∣ten times brought to London, exceeding large and fine; at Newark they have it very large, and likewise at Nottingham.</P>
<P>From Rherford, the Country on the Right of East lies low and marshy, till, by the Confluence of the Rivers Trent, Idle and Don, they are formed into large Islands, of which the first is called the Isle of Axholm, where the Lands are ve∣ry rich, and feed great Store of Cattle: But travelling into those Parts being dif∣ficult, and sometimes dangerous, especi∣ally
<PB REF="404"/>
or Strangers, we contented ourselves with having the Country described to us, as above, and with being assured that there were no Towns of Note, or any thing to be call'd curious, except that they dig old Fir Trees out of the Ground in the Isle of Axholm, which they tell us have lain there ever since the Deluge; but, as I shall meet with the like more eminently in many other Places, I shall content myself with speaking of it once for all, when we come into Lanca∣shire.</P>
<P>There are some few Market Towns in these low Parts between this Place and the Humber, though none of great Con∣sideration, such as Thorne upon the Don, Snathe upon the Aire, Selby upon the Ouse, and Howdon near the same River; the two last are Towns of good Trade, the first being seated where the Ouse is navigable, for large vessels has a good share in the Shipping of the River, and some Merchants live and thrive here; the latter is one of the Towns in England, where their annual Fairs preserve the Name of a Mart, the other Lyn, Boston, Ganesborough, Beverley, tho' of late they begin to lose the Word. The Fair or Mart held here is very considera∣ble for Inland Trade, and several Whole∣sale Tradesmen come to it from London. But I take this Town to be more famous for the Birth of one of our ancient His∣torians, (viz.) Roger of Hovedon or Howdon; Mr. Cambden's Continuator is much in the wrong to say this Town stands upon the Derwent; whereas it is above three Mile East of the Derwent, and no River of any note near it but the Humber.</P>
<P>Having found nothing in this low Part of the Country but a wonderful Conflux of great Rivers, all pouring down into the Humber, which receiving the Aire, the Ouse, the Don and the Trent, be∣comes rather a Sea than a River, we left it on the Right; and knowing we should necessarily visit its Shores again, we turn∣ed up into the Post Road, where, as I said, I left it before near Brotherton, and went on for Tadcaster.</P>
<P>On this Road we pass'd over Towten, that famous Field where the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and bloody Battle was fought between the two Houses of Lancaster and York, in the Reign of Edward IV. I call it most cruel and bloody, because the Animosity of the Parties was so great, that tho' they were Countrymen and Englishmen, Neigh∣bours, nay, as History says, Relations▪ for here Fathers kill'd their Sons, and Sons their Fathers; yet for some time they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought with such Obstinacy a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d such Rancour▪ that void of all Pity and Compassion, they gave no Quarter, and I call it the most bloody, because 'tis certain no such Numbers were ever slain in one Battle in England, since the great Battle between King Harold and William of Normandy, call'd the Conqueror, at Battle in Sussex; for here, at Towten fell Six and thirty thousand Men on both Sides, besides the wounded and Prisoners (if they took any.)</P>
<P>Tradition guided the Country People, and they us, to the very Spot; but we had only the Story in speculation; for there remains no Marks, no Monument, no Remembrance of the Action, only that the Ploughmen say, that sometimes they plough up Arrow-heads and Spe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heads, and broken Javelins, and Helmet▪ and the like; so we could only give a short Sigh to the memory of the Dead, and move forward.</P>
<P>Tadcaster has nothing that we could see to testify the Antiquity it boasts of, but some old Roman Coins, which our Lanlord the Post Master shew'd us, among which was one of Domitian, the same kind, I believe, with that Mr. Cambden, gives an Account of, but so very much defaced with Age, that we could read but D O, and A V, at a distance. Here is the Hospital and School, still remaining founded by Dr. Oglethorp, Bishop of Car∣lisle, who, for want of a Protestant Arch∣bishop, set the Crown on the Head of Queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P><PB REF="405"/>
Here also we saw plainly the Roman Highway, which I have mentioned, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een at Aberforth; and, as antient Writers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell us, of a stately Stone Bridge here; I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay tell you; here was no Bridge at all; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut perhaps no Writer after me will ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e able to say the like; for the Case was this, the antient famous Bridge▪ which I suppose, had stood several hundred Years, being defective, was just pull'd down, and the Foundation of a New Bridge, was said, or rather begun to be laid, or was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying; and we were obliged to go over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he River in a Ferry Boat; but coming <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat way since, I saw the new Bridge <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nished, and very magnificent indeed it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden gives us a little Distich <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a learned Passenger upon this River; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the old Bridge, at Tadcaster; I sup∣pose he pass'd it in a dry Summer, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>renchman did the Bridge at Madrid, which I mentioned before.
<Q><L>"Nil Tadcaster habes muris vel car∣mine dignum,</L>
<L>▪Praeter magnifice struct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m sine flumine pontem.</L></Q></P>
<P>But I can assure the Reader of this Ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount, that altdo' I pass'd this Place in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e middle of Summer, we found Water <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough in the River, so that there was no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssing it without a Boat.</P>
<P>From Tadcaster it is but twelve Miles York; the Country is rich, fruitful <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> populous, but not like the Western <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts about Leeds, Wakefield, Hallifax, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I described above; it bears <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Corn, and the City of York being near, and having the Navigation of so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Rivers also to carry it to Hull, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y never want a good Market for it.</P>
<P>The Antiquity of York, tho' it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the particular Enquiry I proposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke, yet shewed itself so visibly at a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance that we could not but observe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore we came quite up to the City, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean the Mount and high Hills, where antient Castle stood, which when you come to the City, you scarcely see, at least not so as to judge of its Anti∣quity.</P>
<P>The Cathedral, or the Minster, as they call it, is a fine Building, but not so antient as some of the other Churches in the City seem to be: That Mount I mentioned above, and which, at a distance, I say was a Mark of Antiquity, is called the old Bale, which was some Ages ago fortified and made very strong; but Time has eaten through not the Timber and Plank only, which they say it was first built with, but even the Stones and Mor∣tar; for not the least Footsteep of it re∣mains but the Hill.</P>
<P>York is indeed a pleasant and beauti∣ful City, and not at all the less beautiful for the Works and Lines about it being demolished, and the City<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as it may be said, being laid open; for the beauty of Peace is seen in the rubbish; the Lines and Bastions and demolished Fortifications, have a reserved secret pleasantness in them from the Contemplation of the publick Tranquility, that outshines all the beauty of advanced Bastions, Batteries, Cavaliers, and all the hard named Works of the Engineers about a City.</P>
<P>I shall not entertain you either with a Plan of the City; or a Draught of its History; I shall only say in general, the first would take up a great deal of Time, and the last a great deal of Paper; it is enough to tell you, that as it has been always a strong Place, so it has been much contended for, been the Seat of War, the Rendezvous of Armies, and of the great∣est Generals several times.</P>
<P>It boasts of being the Seat of some of the Roman Emperors, and the Station of their Forces for the North of Britain, be∣ing it self a Roman Colony, and the like, all which I leave as I find it; it may be examined critically in Mr. Cambde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ and his Continuator, where it is learnedly debated. However, this, I must not omit namely, that Severus and Constantius Chlorus, Father to Constantine the Great, both kept their▪ Courts here, and both
<PB REF="406"/>
died here. Here Constantine the Great took upon him the Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple, and began the first Christian Empire in the World; and this is truly and really an Honour to the City of York; and this is all I shall say of her Antiquity.</P>
<P>But now things infinitely modern, com∣pared to those, are become Marks of An∣tiquity; for even the Castle of York, built by William the Conqueror, Anno 1069. almost eight hundred Years since Constantine, is not only become ancient and decayed, but even sunk into Time, and almost lost and forgotten; Fires, Sieges, Plunderings and Devastations, have often been the Fate of York; so that one should wander there should be any thing of a City left.</P>
<P>But 'tis risen again, and all we see now is modern; the Bridge is vastly strong, and has one Arch which, they tell me, was near 70 Foot in Diameter; it is, without exception, the greatest in Eng∣land, some say it's as large as the Rialto at Venice, though I think not.</P>
<P>The Cathedral too is modern, it was begun to be built in the Time of Edward the First, Anno 1313. or thereabouts, by one John Roman, who was Treasurer for the Undertaking; the Foundation being laid, and the whole Building designed by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Benevolence of the Gentry, and especially, as a noted Antiquary there assured me, by the particular application of two eminent Families in the North, namely, the Piercys and Vavasors, as is restis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by their Arms and Portraits cut in the Stone work; the first with a Piece of Timber, and the last with a hew'd Stone in their Hands; the first having given a large Wood, and the latter a Quarry of Stone, for encouraging the Work.</P>
<P>It was building during the Lives of three Archbishops, all of the Christian Name of John, whereof the last, (viz) John Thoresby, lived to see it finished, and himself consecrated it.</P>
<P>It is a Gothick Building, but with all the most modern <HI>Addenda</HI> that Order of Building can admit; and with much more Ornament of a singular kind, than we see any thing of that way of Building grac'd with. I see nothing of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Structure in England go beyond except it be the Building we call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Henry VIIth's Chapel, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onal to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Abbey Church at Westminster, and the is not to be named with this, because▪ is but a Chapel, and that but a small <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> neither.</P>
<P>The Royal Chapel at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> King's College Chapel, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> indeed very gay Things, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them can come up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> York on many Accounts; also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tower of the Cathedral Church at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣terbury is named to match with at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but this is but a Piece of a large <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the rest of the same Building <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mean and gross, compared with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> York.</P>
<P>The only d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficiency I find at Y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Minster, is the lowness of the Tower, or its want of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> it, which, doubtless, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Builders; he that lately <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> scription of this Church, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> caster, placed high fine Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> both, took a great deal of Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us he was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> telligence grosly upon trust.</P>
<P>As then this Church was so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> finished, and that so lately that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not yet four hundred Years old it is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less to be wondered that the Work <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so firm and fine, that it is now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beautifullest Church of the old <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is in Britain. In a word, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> End is a Picture, and so is the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the outsides of the Quire especially <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be equall'd.</P>
<P>The Choir of the Church, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spaces round and behind it, are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of noble and magnificent Monumen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many to enter upon the Description them here, some in Marble, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the old manner in▪ Brass, and the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dows are finely painted; but I could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Body learned enough in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>However, to do the Ladies of York∣shire Justice, I found they did not gain any great share of the just Reproach which in some other Places has been due to their Sex, nor has there been so ma∣ny▪ young Fortunes carried off here by half-pay Men, as has been said to be in other Towns, of merry Fame, Westward and Southward.</P>
<P>The Government of the City is that of a regular Corporation, by Mayor, Al∣dermen and Common Council; the Mayor has the Honour here, by ancient Prescrip∣tion of being called <HI>my Lord;</HI> it is a County within its self, and has a Juris∣diction extended over a small Tract of Land on the West Suburb, called the Li∣berty of Ansty, which I could get no uniform account of, one pretending one thing, one another. The City is old but well built; and the Clergy, I mean such as serve in, and depend upon the Cathe∣dral, have very good Houses, or little Palaces rather here, adjoining to the Cy∣meterie, or Church-yard of the Minster; the Bishop's is indeed called a Palace, and is really so; the Deanery is a large, convenient and spacious House; and among these Dwellings of the Clergy is the As∣sembly House. Whence I would infer, the Conduct of it is under the better Go∣vernment, or should be so.</P>
<P>No City in England is better furnished with Provisions of every kind, nor any so cheap, in proportion to the goodness of Things; the River being so naviga∣ble, and so near the Sea, the Merchants here trade directly to what part of the World they will; for Ships of any Bur∣then come up within thirty Miles of the City, and small Craft from sixty or eighty Ton, and under, come up to the very City.</P>
<P>With these they carry on a consider∣able Trade; they import their own Wines from France and Portugal, and likewise their own Deals and Timber from Nor∣way; and indeed what they please almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom where they please, they did also bring their own Coals from Newcastle and Sunderland, but now have them down

the Aire and Calder from Wakefield, and from Leeds, as I have said already.</P>
<P>The Publick Buildings <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdcted here are are very considerable, such as Halls for their Merchants and Trades, a large Town-House or Guild-Hall, and the Prison, which is spacious, and takes up all the Ground within the Walls of the Old Castle, and, in a Building newly erected there, the Assizes for the County are kept.</P>
<P>The Old Walls are standing, and the Gates and Posterns; but the old addition∣al Works which were cast up in the late <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are slighted; so that York is not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as it was then: But Things lie so too, that a little Time, and many Hands, would put those Works into their former Condition, and make the City able to stand out a small Siege. But as the Ground seems capable by Si∣tuation, so an ingenious Head▪ in our Company, taking a stricter View of it, told us, he would undertake to make it as strong as Tournay in Flanders, or as Namure, allowing him to add a Citadel at that end next the River. But this is a Speculation; and 'tis much better that we should hrve no need of fortified Towns than that we should seek out good Situa∣tions to make them.</P>
<P>While we were at York, we took one Day's time to see the fatal Field called Marston Moor, where Prince Rupert, a third time, by his excess of Valour, and defect of Conduct, lost the Royal Army, and had a Victory wrung out of his Hands, after he had all the Advantage in his own Hands that he could desire: Cer∣tain it is, that Charging at the Head of the Right Wing of Horse with that intre∣pid Courage that he always shewed, he bore down all before him in the very beginning of the Battle, and not only put the Enemies Cavalry into Confu∣sion, but drove them quite out of the Field.</P>
<P>Could he have bridled his Temper, and, like an old Soldier, or rather an experi∣enced General, have contented himself with the Glory of that part, sending but one Brigade of his Troops on in the pur∣suit, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d been sufficient to have finished the Work, and have kept the Enemies from rallying, and then with the rest of his Cavalry, wheeled to the Left, and fallen in upon the Croup of the Right Wing of the Enemies Cavalry, he had made a Day of it, and gained the most glorious Victory of that Age; for he had a gallant Army. But he followed the Chace clear off, and out of the Field of Battle; and when he began to return, he had the misfortune to see that his Left Wing of Horse was defeated by Fairfax and Cromwell, and to meet his Friends flying for their Lives; so that he had no∣thing to do but to fly with them, and leave his infantry, and the Duke, then Marquis of Newcastle's, old Veteran Soldiers to be cut in Pieces by the E∣nemy.</P>
<P>I had one Gentleman with me, an old Soldier too, who, though he was not in the Fight, yet gave us a compleat Ac∣count of the Action from his Father's re∣lation, who, he said, had served in it, and who had often shewed him upon the very Spot every▪ part of the Engagement where every distinct Body was drawn up, how far the Lines extended, how the In∣fantry were flank'd by the Cavalry, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Cavalry by the Woods, where the Artillery were planted, and which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they pointed; and he accordingly de∣scribed it in so lively a manner to me, that I thought it was as if I had just now seen the two Armies engaging.</P>
<P>His relation of Prince Rupert's ill Conduct, put me in mind of the quite different Conduct of old General Tilly, who commanded the Imperial Army at the great Battle of Leipsick in Germany, against that glorious Prince Gustavus A∣dolphus.</P>
<P><PB REF="411"/>
Upon the first Charge, the Cavalry of the Right Wing of Tilly's Army, com∣manded by the Count of Furstemburgh, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll on with such Fury, and in such excel∣lent Order, being all old Troops, and most of them Cuirassers, upon the Saxon Troops, which had the Left of the Swed∣ish Army, and made Twenty two thou∣sand Men, that, in short, they put them into Confusion, and drove them upon their Infantry of the main Battle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat all went off together except General Arnhcim, who commanded the Saxon Right Wing, and was drawn up next to the Swedes.</P>
<P>The Saxon being thus put into Con∣fusion, the Imperialists cried Victoria, the Enemy fly, and their General Officers cry'd out to Tilly to let them follow. No, says Tilly, let 'em go, let 'em go; but let us beat the Swedes too, or we do no∣thing, and immediately he ordered the Cavalry that had performed so well, should face to the Left, and charge the rest of the Army in Flank. But the King of Swed∣en, who saw the Disorder, and was ready at all Places to encourage and direct his Troops, ordered Six thousand Scots, un∣der Sir John Hepburn, who made his Line of Reserve, to make a Front to the Left, and face the victorious Troops of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Imperialists, while, in the mean time, with a Fury not to be resisted, he charg∣ed, in Person, upon the Imperial Left, Wing, and bore down all before him.</P>
<P>Then it appeared that Count Tilly was in the right; for though he had not let his Right Wing pursue the Saxons, who, notwithstanding being new Men, never rallied, yet with his whole Army he was not able to beat the rest; but the King of Sweden gained the most glorious Victory that ever a Protestant Army had till then obtained in the World over a Popish. This was 1632</P>
<P>I came back extremely well pleased with the View of Marston Moor, and the Account my Friend had given of the Bat∣tle; 'twas none of our Business to con∣cern our Passions in the Cause, or regret the Misfortunes of that Day; the thing was over beyond our ken; Time had levelled the Victors with the Vanquish∣ed, and the Royal Family being restored, there was no room to say one thing or other to what was pass'd; so we returned to York the same Night.</P>
<P>York, as I have said, is a spacious Ci∣ty, it stands upon a great deal of Ground, perhaps more than any City in England out of Middlesex, except Norwich; but then the Buildings are not close and throng∣ed as at Bristol, or as at Durham; nor is York so populous as either Bristol or Nor∣wich. But as York is full of Gentry and Persons of Distinction, so they live at large, and have Houses proportioned to their Quality; and this makes the City lie so far extended on both Sides the Ri∣ver. It is also very magnificent, and, as we say, makes a good Figure every way in its appearance, even at a distance; for the Cathedral is so noble and so august a Pile, that 'tis a Glory to all the rest.</P>
<P>There are very neat Churches here be∣sides the Cathedral, and were not the Min∣ster standing, like the Capitol in the mid∣dle of the City of Rome, some of these would pass for extraordinary, as the Churches of St. Mary's and Allhallows, and the Steeples of Christ-Church, St. Mary's, St. Peg's, and Allhallows.</P>
<P>There are also two sine Market houses, with the Town hall upon the Bridge, and abundance of other publick Edifices, all which together makes this City, as I said, more stately and magnificent, though not more populous and wealthy, than any o∣ther City in the King's Dominions, Lon∣don and Dublin excepted. The reason of the difference is evidently for the want of Trade.</P>
<P>Here is no Trade indeed, except such as depends upon the Confluence of the Gentry: But the City, as to Lodgings, good Houses, and plenty of Provisions, is able to receive the King, Lords and Commons, with the whole Court, if there was occasion; and once they did enter∣tain King Ch rles I. with his whole Court,
<PB REF="412"/>
and with the Assembly of Peers, besides a vast Confluence of the Gentry from all Parts to the King, and at the same time a great Part of his Army.</P>
<P>We went out in a double Excursion from this City, first to see the Duke of Leeds's House, and then the Earl of Car∣lisle's and the Earl of Burlington's in the East Riding; Carlisle House is by far the finest Design, but it is not finished, and may not, perhaps, in our Time; they say his Lordship sometimes observes Noblemen should only Design, and begin great Palaces, and leave Posterity to fin∣ish them gradually, as their Estates will allow them; it is called Castle Howard. The Earl of Burlington's is an old built House, but stands deliciously, and has a noble Prospect towards the Humber, as also toward the Would.</P>
<P>At Hambledon Down, near this City, are once a Year very great Races▪ ap∣pointed for the Entertainment of the Gen∣try, and they are the more frequented, because the King's Plate of a hundred Guincas is always run for there once a Year; a Gift designed to encourage the Gentlemen to breed good Horses.</P>
<P>Yorkshire is throng'd with Curiosities▪ and two or three constantly attend these Races, namely, First, That (as all Horse Matches do) it brings together abundance of Noblemen and Gentlemen of Distinc∣tion, and a proportion of Ladies; and, I assure you, the last make a very noble Appearance here, and if I may speak my Thoughts without flattery, take the like Number where you will, yet, in spite of the pretended Reproach of Country breeding, the Ladies of the North are as handsome and as well dress'd as are to be seen either at the Court or at the Ball.</P>
<P>From York we did not jump at once over the whole Country, and, like a late Author, without taking notice of any Thing, come out again sixty or seventy Miles off, like an Apparition, without be∣ing seen by the way. The first thing we did, we took a View of the Suburb of York over the River, opposite to the Ci∣ty, and then entring the East Riding, took our Audience de Conge in form, and so stood over that Division towards Hull</P>
<P>In our Road we had a clear View of the Earl of Burlington's noble and magni∣ficent House, mentioned just now, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after our passing the River Derwent▪ on a very high rising Ground, very advantage∣ously situated.</P>
<P>The River Derwent, contrary to the Course of all the Rivers in Yorkshire, (as I have observed) runs North and South, rising in that Part of the Country called Cleveland, and running through, or hard by, several Market Towns, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pocklington, North Malton, and others, and is, by the Course, a good guide to those who would take a View of the whole Country.</P>
<P>I observed the middle of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Division of Yorkshire is very thin of Towns, and consequently of People, be∣ing overspread with Woulds, that is to say, Plains and Downs, like th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of Salisbury; on which they feed great Num∣bers of Sheep, and breed also a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ny Black Cattle and Horses; especially <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Northern Part, which runs <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mountainous, and makes Part of the North Riding of York. But the East a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d West Part is populous and rich, and fall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Towns, the one lying on the Sea <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the other upon the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as above; the Sea Coast or West <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> call'd Holderness.</P>
<P>After passing the Derwent we saw <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of moment, but keeping under the Woulds or Hills mentioned above, we came to your old Acquaintance John a Beverley, I mean the famous Monastery at that Town.</P>
<P>It is a large and populous Town, tho' I find no considerable Manufacture carried on there. The great Collegiate Church is the main Thing which ever did, and still does, make the Town in the World. The famous Story of John of Bev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rley, is, in short, this; That one John, Arch∣bishop of York, a learned and devou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man, out of me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r pious Zeal for Reli∣gion, and Contempt of the World, quit∣ted or renounced his Honours and Superi∣ority

<P>This Story will prompt you to en∣quire how long ago 'twas, for you know as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and will naturally observe, that very few such Bishops are to be found <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was indeed a long time ago, for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his very Year just five Year above a thousand Year ago that this happened; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r the good Man died Anno Dom. 721. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may soon cast up the rest to 1726.</P>
<P>The memory of this extraordinary Man <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s been much honoured; and had they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no farther, I should have join'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them most heartily. But as to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and praying to him, and off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Shrine, and such Things, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Protestants must ask their leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing to say to.</P>
<P>However, King Athelstan, after making <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to him if he got the Victory over <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Danes, made him his Tutclar Saint, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gave great Gifts and Immunities to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place on his Account; among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the King granted his Peace to it, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was the Word in those Days; that is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, made it a Sanctuary, as he did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about the same time to the Church <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and I shall here give you the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his Grant in the old English <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as I did of the other.</P>

<P>After some time, the Town growing bigger and bigger, the Church was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enlarged; and though it fell into the

King's Hands, King Henry VIII. having done by this as he did by others; and the Monks of Beverley were suppressed, yet the Town continues a large, populous Town; and the River Hull is made na∣vigable to it for the convenience of Trade.</P>
<P>I remember, soon after the Revolution, when the late King William hired six thousand Danish Auxiliaries to assist him in his Wars in Ireland, they landed at Hull, and, marching from thence for West-Chester, in order to embark for Carrick∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgus, they came thro' this Town, and halted here a few Days for Refreshment: Here two of their Foot Soldiers quarrel∣led and sought a Duel, in which one of them was kill'd. The other being taken, was immediately tried and sentenced by a Court Marshal of their own Officers, and by the Rules of War, such as were in force among them, was sentenced and put to Death, and was then buried in the same Grave with the Man he had kill'd; and upon their Grave is set up a Stone with an English Inscription thus▪</P>
<P>Under this Stone two Danish Soldiers lie.</P>
<P>There are other Lines mentioning the Story, as above, but I do not remember them, it being some Years since I made this Observation. But to return to St. John of Beverley, and King Athelstan's merry Grant, which I shall make speak English as well as I can; it is as follows:</P>

</LG>
<P>From Beverley I came to Hull, distance six Miles. If you would expect me to g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e an Account of the City of Ham∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgh or Dantzick, or Rotterdam, or any of the second Rate Cities abroad, which ate fam'd for their Commerce, the Town of Hull may be a specimen. The Place is indeed not so large as those; but, in proportion to the Dimensions of it, I believe there is more Business done in Hull than in any Town of its bigness in Europe; Leverpool indeed of late comes after it apace; but then Lever∣pool has not the London Trade to add to it.</P>
<P>In the late War, the Fleets from Hull to London were frequently a hundred Sad, sometimes including the other Creeks in the Humber, a hundred and fifty to a hundred and sixty Sail at a Time; and to Holland their Trade is so considerable, that the Dutch always employ'd two Men of War to fetch and carry, that is, to convoy the Trade, as they called it, to and from Hull, which was as many as they did to London.</P>
<P>In a Word, all the Trade at Leeds, Wakefield and Halli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ax, of which I have spoken so justly and so largely, is tran∣sacted here, and the Goods are shipped here by the Merchants of Hull; all the Lead Trade of Derbyshire and Notting∣hamshire, from Beautry Wharf, the But∣ter of the East and North Riding, brought down the Ouse to York: The Cheese brought down the Trent from Stafford, Warwick and Cheshire, and the Corn from all the Counties adjacent, are brought down and shipped off here.</P>
<P>And, they supply all these Countries in return with foreign Goods of all kinds, for which they Trade to all Parts of the known World; nor have the Merchants of any Port in Britain a fairer Credit, or fairer Character, than the Merchants of Hull, as well for the Justice of their Dealings as the Greatness of their sub∣stance or Funds for Trade. They drive a great Trade here to Norway, and to to the Baltick, and an important Trade here to Dantzick, Riga, Narva and Pe∣tersburgh; from whence they make large Returns in Iron, Copper, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, Pot-Ashes, Muscovy Linnen and Yarn, and other Things; all which they
<PB REF="418"/>
get vent for in the Country to an ex∣ceeding Quantity. They have also a great Importation of Wine, Linen, Oil, Fruit, &amp;c. trading to Holland, France and Spain; the Trade of Tobacco and Su∣gars from the West Indies, they chiefly manage by the Way of London. But be∣sides all this, their Export of Corn, as well to London as to Holland and France, exceeds all of the kind, that is or can be do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e at any Port in England, London excepted.</P>
<P>Their Shipping is a great Article in which they outdo all the Towns and Ports on the Coast except Ya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mouth, only that thei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pping consists chiefly in smaller Vesse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls than the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Trade is suppl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d with, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho' they have a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge Vessels too, which are employed in their foreign Trade.</P>
<P>The Town is situated at the Mouth of the River Hull, where it fills into the Humber, and where the Humber opens in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the German Ocean, so that one S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de of their Town lies upon the Sea, the o¦ther upon the Land. This makes the Si∣tuation naturally very strong; and were there any occasion, it is capable of be∣ing▪ made impregnable, by reason of the low Situation of the Grounds round it.</P>
<P>King Charles II. on occasion of the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣quent Dutch Wars in that Reign, had once resolved to appoint a Station for a Squadron of Men of War here; with a Yard and Dock, for building Men of War (Ships) in the Humber; and, on this oc∣casion, resolved to make the Place strong, in proportion to the Necessity of those Affairs; upon which a large Citadel was marked out on the other Side the River; but it was never finished.</P>
<P>The greatest imperfection, as to the strength of Hull in Case of a War, is, that, lying open to the Sea, it is liable to a Bombardment; which can only be pre∣vented by being Masters at Sea, and while we are so, there's no need of Fortificati∣ons at all; and so there's an end of Argu∣ment upon that Subject.</P>
<P>The Town is exceeding close <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> should a Fire ever be its Fate, it might suffer deeply on that Account; 'tis ex∣traordinary populous, even to an incon∣venience, having really no room to ex∣tend it self by Buildings. There are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t two Churches, but one of them is very large, and there are two or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very large Meeting houses, and a Market <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lor∣ed with an infinite plenty of all So<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of Provision.</P>
<P>They shew us still in their Town hall the Figure of a Northern Fisherman, sup∣posed to be of Groenla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, that is to say, the real Greenland, being the Conti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of America to the North of those we call the North West Passages; not of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lt∣bergen where our Ships go a Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and which is, by mista<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Greenland. He was taken up at S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a in a Leather Boat▪ which he sate in, and was covered with Skins, which drew together about his Waste, so that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t fill, and he could not sink; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would never feed nor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o died.</P>
<P>They have a very handsome Exchange here, where the Merchants meet as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t London, and, I assure you, it is wonder∣fully fi led and that with a Confluence of real Merchants, and many Foreigners, and several from the Count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y; for the Navigation of all the great Rivers which fall into the Humber centers here such as the Trent, the Idle, the Don, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Calder, and the Ouse; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Commerce of all the great Towns on those Rivers is managed here, from Gainsborough and No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tingham on the Trent, York and Selby on the Ouse, and so of the rest.</P>
<P>There is also a fine Free School, over which is the Merchant's Hall. But the Trinity-house here is the Glory of the Town: It is a Corporation of itself, made up of a Society of Merchants: It was begun by voluntary Contribution for Re∣lief of distressed and aged Seamen, and their Wives or Widows; but was after∣wards approved by the Government, and
<PB REF="419"/>
incorporated: They have a very good Revenue, which encreases every Day by Charities and Bounties of pious minded People.</P>
<P>They maintain thirty Sisters now actu∣ally in the House, Widows of Seamen; they have a Government by twelve Elder Brethren and six Assistants; out of the 12 they chuse annually two Wardens, but the whole eighteen vote in electing them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two Stewards. These have a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ower to decide Disputes between M sters of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ps and their Crews, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> rela∣ting to the Sea Affairs only▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h this Limitation, that their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not contrary to the Laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and, even in Trials at Law, in such <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they are often called to give <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Opinions.</P>
<P>They have a noble Stone Bridge here over the River Hull▪ consisting of four∣teen Arches. They had once set up a Greenland Fishery▪ and it went on with success for a time; but it decayed in the time when the Dutch Wars were so fre∣quent, and the House built by the Green∣land Merchants is now turned into Gra∣naries for Corn, and Warehouses for other Goods</P>
<P>The old Hospital, call'd God's House, stands near it, with a Chapel rebuilt since the late War, and the Arms of Michael de la Pole, the first Founder, set up again; so that the Foundation is restored, the Building is nobly enlarged, and an entire new Hospital built as an addition to the old one. The Story of this De la Pole may not be unwelcome, because, though it be a Piece of Antiquity, 'tis a Piece of Honour both to the Merchants of Hull, and to the Town it self. Sir Michael de la Pole was a Merchant of Hull, but first at a Place called Raven's Rood in Brabant, where, growing rich, he advanced to King Richard II. several thousand Pounds in Gold for his urgent Occasions in his Wars; upon which the King invited him to come and live in England, which he did; here the King knighted him, and made his Son, Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, gave him several Lordships in Holderness; and Mr. Cambden observes, he is stiled by the King in those Grants, William de la Pole, Dilectus Valectus &amp; Mercator Noster, so that he was called the King's Merchant.</P>
<P>This De la Pole founded a Monastry of Carthusians, and an Hospital, which, when that was suppress'd, remained; and this they call God's House.</P>
<P>Farther East from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there is a little pleasant Town called <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>don, handsome, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and having a little Haven from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> threatens Hull, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be a great Place, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cases dai y; but I fear <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Haven will do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for them, unless they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very considerable for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>They tell us at Headon, that the Sea encroaches upon the Land on all that Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and that there are many large Field qui e eaten up; that several Towns were formerly known to be there, which are now lost; from whence they may sup∣pose, that as the Sea by Encroachment has damnified their Harbour, so if it grows upon them a little more they shall stand open to the Sea, and so need no Harbour at all, or make a Mole, as 'tis called a∣broad, and have a good Road without it. But this is a View something remote.</P>
<P>The Spurn Head, a long Promontory thrusting out into the Sea, and making the North Point of Humber, is a remarkable thing. But I leave that to the Descripti∣on of the Sea Coasts, whch is none of my Work; the most that I find remark∣able here, is, that there is nothing re∣markable upon this side for above thirty Miles together; not a Port, nor a Gentl∣man's Seat, not a Town of Note; Brid¦lington or Burlington is the only Place, and that is of no note, only for a Bay or Road for shipping, which is of use to the Colliers on this Coast to defend them, in Case of Extremity of Weather.</P>
<P>The Country People told us a long Story here of Gipsies which visit them often in a surprising manner. We were strangely amused with their Discourses at

first, forming our Ideas from the Word, which, in ordinary import with us, signi∣fies a sort of strolling, Fortune-telling, Hen roost-robbing, Pocket-picking Vaga∣bonds, called by that Name. But we were soon made to understand the Peo¦ple, as they understood themselves here, namely, that at some certain Seasons, for none knows when it will happen, several Streams of Water, shush out of the Earth with great Violence, spouting up a huge heighth, being really natural Jette d'caus or Fountains, that they make a great Noise, and, joining together, form little Rivers, and so hasten to the Sea, I had not time to examine into the Particulars; and as the irruption was not just then to be seen, we could say little to it: That which was most observable to us, was, that the Coun∣try People have a Notion that whenever those Gipsies, or, as some call em', Vip∣seys, break out, there will certainly ensue either Famine or Plague. This put me in mind, that the very same thing is said to happen at Smitham Bottom in Surrey, beyond Croydon, on the Road to Rye∣gate, fills the whole Bottom, and makes a large River running just to the Towns End of Croydon; and then turning to the Left runs into the River which rises in the Town, and runs to Cashalton; and I name it, because the Country People here have exactly the same Notion, that this Water never breaks out but against a Famine; and as I am sure it has not now broken out for more than fifty Years, it may, for ought I know, be true.</P>
<P>Scarborough next presents itself, a place formerly famous for the strong Ca∣stle, situate on a Rock, as it were hang∣ing over the Sea, but now demolish'd, being ruined in the last wars. The Town is well built, populous and plea∣sant, and we found a great deal of good Company here drinking the Waters, who came not only from the North of Eng∣land, but even from all the North of Scot∣land. It is hard to describe the Taste of the Waters; they are apparently ting'd with a collection of mineral Salts, as of Vitriol, allom, Iron, and perhaps Sul∣phur, and taste evidently of the allom. Here is such a plenty of all sorts of l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh that I have hardly seen the like, and in particular, here we saw Turbets of three quarters of a hundred Weight, and yet their Flesh eat exceeding find when taken new.</P>

<PB REF="421"/>

<P>I must now leave Yorkshire, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deed I might more fully have described, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I had had time; for there are abun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce of Rarities in Nature spoken of in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> North Riding, which I had not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to enquire into; as the Allom Mines <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> near Moultgrave or Musgrave, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whence the Lord Musgrave, now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Buckinghamshire, has his Title, he has also a great Part of his Estate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Allom Works not far off.

<P>urham is next, a little compact neat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntriv'd City, surrounded almost with River Wear, which with the Castle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on an eminence, encloses the in the middle of it; as the Castle also the Cathedral, the Bishop's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the fine Houses of the Clergy, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they live in all the Magnificence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plendor imaginable.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed not tell you, that the Bishop urham is a Temporal Prince, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eps a Court of Equity, and also <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Justice in ordinary Causes with∣in himself. The County of Durham, like the Country about Rome, is called St. Cuthbert's Patrimony. This Church, they tell us, was founded by David, King of Scots; and afterward Zouch, the va∣liant Bishop, fought the Scots Army at Nevil's Cross, where the Scots were ter∣ribly cut in Pieces, and their King taken Prisoner.</P>
<P>But what do I dip into Antiquity for, here, which I have avoided as much as possible every where else. The Church of Durham is eminent for its Wealth▪ the Bishoprick is esteemed the best in England; and the Prebends and other Church Livings, in the Gift of the Bi∣shop, are the richest in England▪ They told me there, that the Bishop had thir∣teen Livings in his Gift▪ from five hun∣dred Pounds a Year to thirteen hundred Pounds a Year; and the Living of the little Town of Sedgfield, a few Miles South of the City, is said to be worth twelve hundred Pounds a Year, beside the small Tithes, which maintain a Curate, or might do so.</P>
<P>Going to see the Church of Durham, they shewed us the old Popish Vestments of the Clergy before the Reformation, and which, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n high Days, some of the Residents put on still. They are so rich with embroidery and emboss'd work of Silver, that indeed it was a kind of a Load to stand under them.</P>
<P>The Town is well built but old, full of Roman Catholicks, who live peaceably and disturb no Body, and no Body them; for we being there on a Holiday, saw them going as publickly to Mass as the Dissen∣ters did on other Days to their Meeting-house.</P>
<P>From hence we kept the common Road to Chester in the Street, an old, dirty, thorowfare Town, empty of all Remains of the Greatness which Antiquaries say it once had, when it was a Roman Colony. Here is a Stone Bridge, but instead of rid∣ing over it we rode under it, and riding up the Stream pass'd under or through one of the Arches, not being over the Horses Hoofs
<PB REF="422"/>
in Water; yet, on enquiry, we found, that sometimes they have use enough for a Bridge</P>
<P>Here we had an Account of a melan∣choly Accident, and in it self strange al∣so, which happened in or near Lumley Park, not long before we pass'd through the Town. A new Coal Pit being dug or digging, the Workmen workt on in the Vein of Coals till they came to a Cavity, which, as was supposed, had for∣merly been dug from some other Pit; but be it what it will▪ as soon as upon the breaking into the hollow Part, the pent up Air got vent▪ it blew up like a Mine of a thousand Barrels of Powder, and, getting Vent at the Shaft of the Pit, burst out with such a terrible Noise, as made the very Earth tremble for some Miles round, and terrify d the whole Country. There were near threescore poor People lost their Lives in the Pit, and one or two, as we were told, who were at the bottom of the Shaft, were blown quite out, though sixty Fathom deep, and were found dead upon the Ground.</P>
<P>Lundey Castle is just on the Side of the Road as you pass between Durham and Chester, pleasantly seated in a fine Park, and on the Bank of the River Were. The Park, besides the pleasantness of it, has this much better thing to recommend it, namely, that it is full of excellent Veins of the best Coal in the Country, (for the Lumley Coal are known for their Goodness at London▪ as well as there.) This, with the navigable River just at hand, by which the Coals are carrid down to Sunderland to the Ships, makes Lumley Park an inexhaustible Treasure to the Fa∣mily.</P>
<P>They tell us, that King James the First lodg'd in this Castle, at his entrance into England to take Possession of the Crown, and seeing a fine Picture of the antient Pedigree of the Family, which carrid it very far beyond what his Majesty thought credible, turn'd this good Jest upon it to the Bishop of Durham, who shewed it him, viz. That indeed he did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Adam's Sirname was Lumley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fore.</P>
<P>From hence the Road to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gives a View of the inexhausted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Coals and Coal Pits, from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> London only, but all the South Part <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England is continually supplied; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when we are at London, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the prodigious Fleets of Ships <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come constantly in with Coals for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> creasing City, we are apt to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whence they come, and that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bring the whole Country away; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the contrary, when in this Country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see the prodigious Heaps, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mountains, of Coals, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at every Pit, and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> there are; we are filled with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to consider where the People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> live that can consume them.</P>
<P>Newcastle is a spacious, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> finitely populous Place; 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the River Tyne, which is here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> large and deep River, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reasonable Burthen may come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the very Town. As the Town <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> both Sides the River, the Parts are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a very strong and stately Store <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of seven very great Arches, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than the Arches of London <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Bridge is built into a Street of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also, as London Bridge is</P>

<P>There is also a very noble <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here, called the Exchange: And as Wall of the Town runs parallel fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the River, leaving a spacious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Ground before it between the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Wall, that Ground, being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wharf'd up, and fac'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

makes the longest and largest Key for landing and lading Goods that is to be seen in England, except that at Yarmouth in Norsol's, and much longer than that at Bristol.</P>
<P>Here is a large Hospital built by Con∣tribution of the Keel Men, by way of friendly Society, for the Maintenance of the Poor of their Fraternity, and which, had it not met with Discouragements from those who ought rather to have as∣sisted so good a Work, might have been a noble Provision for that numerous and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aborious People. The Keel Men are those who manage the Lighters, which they call Keels, by which the Coals are taken from the Steaths or Wharfs, and carried ou board the Ships, to load them for London.</P>
<P>Here are several large publick Build∣ings also, as particularly a House of State for the Mayor of the Town (for the Time being) to remove to, and dwell in during his Year: Also here is a H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l for the Surgeons, where they meet, where they have two Skeletons of humane Bo∣dies, one a Man and the other a Woman, and some other Rarities.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Town to the Landward is exceeding unpleasant, and the Buildings very close and old, standing on the Declivity of two exceeding high Hills, which, together with the Smoke of the Coals, makes it not the pleasantest Place in the World to live in; but it is made amends abundantly by the Goodness of the River, which runs between the two Hills, and which as I said, bringing Ships up to the very Keys, and fetching
the Coals down from the Country, makes it a Place of very great Business. Here are also two Articles of Trade which are par∣ticularly occasioned by the Coals, and these are Glass-houses and Salt Pans; the first are at the Town it self, the last are at Shields, seven Miles below the Town; but their Coals are brought chiefly from the Town. It is a prodigious Quantity of Coals which those Salt Works consume; and the Fires make such a Smoke, that we saw it ascend in Clouds over the Hills, four Miles before we came to Dur∣ham, which is at least sixteen Miles from the Place.</P>
<P>Here I met with a Remark which was quite new to me, and will be so, I sup∣pose, to those that hear it. You well know, we receive at London every Year a great Quantity of Salmon pickled or cured, and sent up in the Pickle in Kits or Tubs, which we call Newcastle Sal∣mon; now when I came to Newcastle, I expected to see a mighty plenty of Sal∣mon there, but was surprized to find, on the contrary, that there was no great Quantity, and that a good large fresh Salmon was not to be had under five or six S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ings Upon enquiry I found, that really this Salmon, that we call Now∣castle Salmon, is taken as far off as the Tweed, which is threescore Miles, and is brought by Land on Horses to Shields, where it is cur'd, pickl'd, and sent to London, as above; so that it ought to be called Berwick Salmon, not New∣castle</P>
<P>There are five or six Churches in New∣castle, I mean on the Town side, being North by Time, besides Meeting-houses, of which, I was told, there are also five or six, (including the Quakers) some of which are throng'd with Multitudes of People, the Place, as has been said, being exceeding populous. It is not only en∣riched by the Coal Trade; but there are also very considerable Merchants in it who carry on foreign Trade to divers Parts of the World, especially to Holland, Hamburgh, Norway, and the Baltick.</P>
<P>They build Ships here to Perfection, I mean as to Strength and Firmness, and to bear the Sea; and as the Coal Trade oc∣casions a Demand for such strong Ships, a great many are built here. This gives an Addition to the Merchants Business, in requiring a Supply of all sorts of naval Stores to fit out those Ships.</P>
<P>Here is also a considerable Manufacture of Hard Ware, or Wrought Iron, lately erected after the Manner of Sheffield,
<PB REF="424"/>
which is very helpful for employing the Poor, of which this Town has always a prodigious Number.</P>
<P>West of this Town lies the Town of Hexham, a Pass upon the Tine, famous, or indeed infamous, for having the first Blood drawn at it, in the War against their Prince by the Scots in King Charles the First's time, and where a strong Detach∣ment of English, tho' advantageously posted, were scandalously defeated by the Scots. Whether the Commanders were in fault, or the Men, I know not, but they gave way to an inferior Number of Scots, who gain'd the Pass, fought through the River, and killed about four hundred Men, the rest basely running away; af∣ter which, the Town of Newcastle was as easily quitted also, without striking a Stroke; the Country round this Town is vulgarly call'd Hexamshire.</P>
<P>I was tempted greatly here to trace the famous Picts Wall, built by the Romans, or rather rebuilt by them, from hence to Carlisle; of the Particulars of which, and the Remains of Antiquity seen upon it, all our Histories are so full; and I did go to several Places in the Fields thro' which it passed, where I saw the Re∣mains of it, some almost lost, some plain to be seen. But Antiquity not being my business in this Work, I omitted the Journey, and went on for the North.</P>
<P>Northumberland is a long coasting Coun∣ty, lying chiefly on the Sea to the East, and bounded by the Mountains of Stain∣more and Cheviot on the West, which are in some Places inaccossible, in many unpassable▪ Here is abundant Business for an Antiquary; every Place shews you ruin'd Castles, Roman Altars, in∣scriptions, Monuments of the Battles of Heroes killed, and Armies routed, and the like: The Towns of Morpeth, Aln∣wick, Warkworth, Tickell, and many others, shew their old Castles, and some of them still in tolerable repair, as Aln∣wick in particular, and Warkworth; others, as Bambrough, Norham, Chillingham, Hor∣ton, Dunstar, Wark, and innumerable more, are sunk in their own ruins▪ by the meet length of Time.</P>
<P>We had Cheviot Hills so plain in View, that we could not but enquire of the good old Women every whe∣ther they had heard of the Fight at chary They not only told us they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d heard of it, but had all the Account of it at their Fingers end; and, taking a Guide at Wooller to shew us the Road he pointed out distinctly to us the very Spot where the Engagement was, h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, he said, Earl Piercy was killed and there Earl Douglass, here Sir William Wathing∣ton sought upon his Stumps, here the Englishmen that were slain were buried, and there the Scots.</P>
<P>A little way off this North, he shewed us the Field of Battle, called Flodden Fiel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, upon the Barks of the Till, where James V. King of Scotland, desperately fighting, was killed, and his whole Ar∣my overthrown by the English, under the noble and gallant Earl of Surrey, in the Reign of King Henry VIII. upon their persidiously invading England, while the King was absent on his Wars in France.</P>
<P>I must not quit Northumberland with∣out taking notice, that the Natives of this Country, of the antient original Race or Families, are distinguished by a Slab∣boleth upon their Tongues, namely, a difficulty in pronouncing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which they cannot deliver from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tongues without a hollow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rring in the Throat by which they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> known as a Foreigner is, in pronouncing the Th: This they call the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> R, and the Natives value <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon that Imperfection, because, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it shews the Antiquity of their Blood</P>

<P>I cannot but say, that since I entred on the View of these Northern Coun¦s, I have many times repented that I early resolved to decline the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> View of Antiquity, here being so great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so surprising a Variety, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more and more discovered; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndance since the Tour which the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned Mr. Cambden made this Way, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many since his Learned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for as the Trophies, the Buildings, religious, as well as military Remains, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell of the Britains, as of the Romans, ons, and Normans, are but, as we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, like Wounds hastily healed up, <HI>Calous</HI> spread over them being re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they appear presently; and though <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which naturally eats into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>est Stones, Metals, or whatever Substance, simple or compound, is or can be by Art or Nature prepared to en∣dure it, has defaced the Surface, the Fi∣gures and Inscriptions upon most of these Things, yet they are beautiful, even in their decay, and the venerable Face of Antiquity has something so pleasing, so surprizing, so satisfactory in it, espe∣cially to those who have with any Atten∣tion read the Histories of pass'd ages, that I know nothing renders Travelling more pleasant and more agreeable.</P>
<P>But I have condemn'd my self (un∣happily) to Silence upon this Head, and therefore, resolving however to pay this Homage to the Dust of gallant Men and glorious Nations. I say therefore, I must submit and go on; and as I resolve once more to travel through all these North∣ern Countries upon this very Errand, and to please, nay, satiate myself with a strict Search into every thing that is curious in Nature and Antiquity. I mortify my self now with the more case, in hopes of letting the World see, some time or other, that I have not spent those Hours in a vain and barren Search, or come back without a sufficient Reward to all the Labours of a diligent Enquirer; but of this by the way. I must, for the pre∣sent, make this Circuit shorter than usual, and leave the Description of the other Counties to my next.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY X.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus finished my Ac∣count of the East Side of the North Division of England, I put a stop here, that I may ob∣serve the exact Course of my Travels; for as I do not write you these Letters from the Observations of one single Jour∣ney, so I describe Things as my Journies lead me, having no less than five times travelled through the North of England, and almost every time by a different Rout; purposely that I might see every thing that was to be seen, and, if possible, know every thing that is to be known, though not (at least till the last general Journey) knowing or resolving upon writing these Accounts to you. Now as by my exact Observations on all these several Traverses of the Country, I hope I am not the less able, so I am sure I am much the better furnished, as well to tell you wherein others have ignorantly or superficially re∣presented Things, as to give you such other and fuller Accounts, as in your own intended Travels you will find confirmed, and by which you will be able the better to guide your father Enquires.</P>
<P>I entred Lancashire at tbe remotest Western Point of that County, having been at West-Chester upon a particular Occasion, and from thence ferry'd over from the Cestrian Chersonesus, as I have already call'd it, to Liverpoole. This narrow Slip of Land, rich, fertile and full of Inhabitants, tho' formerly, as Authors say, a meer waste and desolate Forest, is called Wirall, or by some Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣hall. Here is a Ferry over the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which, at full Sea, is more than two Miles over. We land on the flat Sher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the other Side, and are contented to ride through the Water for some length not on Horseback but on the Shoulders of some honest Lancashire Clown, who comes Knee deep to the Boat side, to truss you up, and then runs away with you, as nimbly as you desire to ride, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unless his Trot were easier; for I was shaken by him that I had the luck to be carry'd by more than I car'd for, and much wrose than a hard trotting Horse would have shaken me.</P>
<P>Liverpoole is one of the Wonders <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Britain, and that more, in my Opinion than any of the Wonders of the Peak; the Town was, at my first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> about the Year 1680, a large, handsome, well built and encreasing or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Town; at my second Visit, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it was much bigger than at my first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, and, by the report of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more than twice as big as it was twenty Years before that; but, I think, I may safely say at this my third seeing it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I was surpriz'd at the View, it was more than double what it was at the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and, I am told▪ that it still visibly en∣creases both in Wealth, People, Business and Building: What it may grow to in time, I know not.</P>
<P>There are no Fortifications either to Landward or Seaward, the Inhabitants
<PB REF="427"/>
resting secure under the Protection of the general Peace; though when the late Nor∣thern Insurrection spread down their Way, and came to Preston, they could have been glad of Walls and Gates; and in∣deed, had the Rebel Party had time to have advanced to Warrington, seized the Pass there, and taken Manchester, as they would certainly have done in three Days more, it would have fared but very ill with Liverpoole; who could have but little Resistance against an arm'd and des∣perate Body of Men, such as they ap∣peared to be, and by that time would have been: Besides, the Invaders would here have found not the Sweets of Plun∣der and Lead, all which they extreamly wanted; they would have had Ships also to have facilitated a Communication with their Fellows in Ireland, who would have throng'd over upon the least View of their Success, if it had been only in hopes of Plunder.</P>
<P>But Heaven had Liverpoole in its par∣ticular Protection, as well as the whole Kingdom; the Rebels were met with, sought and defeated, before they got leave to get so far, or to make any offer that Way. The Story of which, as it does not belong to this Work, so it is too re∣cent in memory, to need any Account of it here, other than in general.</P>
<P>The Town has now an opulent, flour∣ishing and encreasing Trade, not rivalling Bristol, in the Trade to Virginia, and the English Island Colonies in America only, but is in a fair way to exceed and eclipse it, by encreasing every way in Wealth and Shipping. They trade round the whole Island, send Ships to Noway, to Hamburgh, and to the Baltick, as also to Holland, and Flanders; so that, in a word, they are almost become like the Londoners, universal Merchants.</P>
<P>The Trade of Liverpoole is not my particular Province, so I shall be short in that part; it consists not only in Merchan∣dizing and Correspondencies beyond Seas; but as they Import almost all kind of foreign Goods, they have consequently a great Inland Trade, and a great Corres∣pondence with Ireland, and with Scot∣land, for their C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsumption, exactly as it is with Bristol; and they really divide the Trape with Bristol upon very remark∣able Equalities.</P>
<P>Bristol lies open to the Irish Sea, so does Liverpoole: Bristol trades chiefly to the South and West Parts of Ireland; from Dublin in the East, to Galloway West; Liverpoole has all the Trade of the Fast Shore and the North, from the Harbour of Dublin to London Derry</P>
<P>Bristol has the Trade of South Wales; Liverpoole great Part of the Trade of North Wales; Bristol has the South West Counties of England and some N rth of it, as high as Bridge North, and perhaps to Shrewsbury; Liverpoole has all the Northern Counties, and a large Consump∣tion of Goods in Cheshire and Stafford∣shire are supplied from Liverpoole. It is some Advantage to the growing Com∣merce of this Town, that the Freemen of it are, in consequence of that Freedom, Free also of Bristol; and they are Free also of the Corporations of Waterford and Waxford in the Kingdom of Ireland. Not that these Corporation Privileges are of any great Value to Liverpoole in its foreign Trade, but in particular Cases it may be some Advantage, as in Town Duties, in admitting them to set up Trades in those Corporations, and the like.</P>
<P>The People of Liverpoole seem to have a different Seene of Commerce to act on from the City of Bristol, which to me is a particular Advantage to both, namely, that though they may rival one another in their Appearances, in their Number of Shipping, and in several Particulars, yet they need not interfere with one ano∣ther's Business, but either of them seem to have room enough to extend their Trade, even at home and abroad, without clashing with one another. One has all the North, and the other all the South of Britain to correspond in. As for Wales, 'tis, as it were, divided between them by Nature it self. Bristol lies open to South Wales, and
<PB REF="428"/>
into the very Heart of, by the Naviga∣tion of the Rivers Wye and Lug, and by the many open Harbours all the Way the Milford and St. David's, and into all the East Side of Wales, and the Coun∣ties of Monmouth, Hereford and Salop, by the Severn; Liverpoole has the same with North Wales by the Water of Dee, the Cluyd, the Conway, Canal of the Mona, and all the Rivers in Carnar∣von Bay.</P>
<P>Ireland is, as it were, all their own, and shared between them, as above; and for the Northern Coast of it, if the Li∣verpoole Men have not the whole Fishe∣ry, or, at least, in Company with the Merchants of London Derry, the fault is their own. The Situation of Liverpoole gives it a very great Advantage to im∣prove their Commerce, and extend it in Northern Inland Counties of England, particularly into Cheshire and Stafford∣shire, by the new Navigation of the Ri∣vers Mersee, the Weaver, and the Dane, by the last of which they come so near the Trent with their Goods, that they make no Difficulty to carry them by Land to Burton, and from thence cor∣respond quite through the Kingdom, even to Hull; and they begin to be very sen∣sible of the Advantage of such a Com∣merce. But I must not dwell here; I might otherwise take up great part of the Sheets I have left in describing the Commerce of this Town, and some of its Neighbours.</P>
<P>I return therefore to the Description of it as a Town; the Situation being on the North Bank of the River, and with the particular disadvantage of a flat Shore. This exposed the Merchants to great Difficulties in their Business, for though the Harbour was good and the Ships rode well in the Offing, yet they were obliged to ride there as in a Road rather than a Harbour. Here was no Mole or Haven to bring in their Ships and lay them up, (as the Seamen call it) for the Winter; nor any Key for the deli∣vering their Goods, as at Bristol, Biddi∣ford, Newcastle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Upon this, the Inhabitants and Merchan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have, of late Years, and since the visi∣ble encrease of their Trade, made a large Basin or wet Dock, at the East end of the Town, where at an immense Charge, the Place considered, they have brought the Tide from the Mersee to slow up by an opening that looks to the South, and the Ships go in North; so that the Town entirely shelters it from the Wester∣ly and Northerly Winds, the Hills from the Easterly, and the Ships lie, as in a Mill-pond, with the utmost safety and convenience. As this is so great a Benefit to the Town, and that the like is not to be seen in any Place in England but here, I mean London excepted, it is well worth the observation and imitation of many other trading Places in Britain who want such a Convenience, and, for want of it, lose their Trade.</P>
<P>The new Church built on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Side of the Town is worth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 'Tis a noble, large Building, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> well finish d; has in it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Marble placed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> surrounded with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> do; the Gift of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a Merchant of London, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> concerned in Trade on this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> many Years Member of Parliament <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Lancaster. There is a beautiful Tower to this Church, and a new Ring of eight very good Bells.</P>
<P>The Town-House is a fine modern Building, standing all upon Pillars of Free∣stone; the Place under it is their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Exchange, for the Meceing of their Merchants; but they begin to want Room, and talk of enlarging it or removing the Exchange to the other part of the Town, where the Ships and the Merchants Bu∣siness is nearer hand.</P>
<P>In a Word, there is no Town in Eng∣land, London excepted, that can equal Liverpoole for the fineness of the Streets, and beauty of the Buildings; many of the Houses are all of Free Stone, and compleatly finished; and all the rest (of the new part I mean) of Brick, as hand∣somely built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> itself.</P>
<P><PB REF="429"/>
Mr. Cambden, says, it was a neat and populous Town in his Time; his Re∣verend Continuator confirms what I have said thus, that it was more than doubly encreased in Buildings and People in twen∣ty eight Years, and that the Customs were augmented Tenfold in the same Time; to which I am to add, that they are now much greater, that being written about two and thirty Years ago, before the new Church, or the wet Dock, men∣tioned above, were made, and we know they have gone on encreasing in Trade, Buildings and People, to this Day. I re∣fer the Reader therefore to judge of the probable Greatness of it now.</P>
<P>From hence the Mersee opening into the Irish Sea, we could see the great and famous Road of Hile Lake, made fa∣mous for the shipping off, or rather Ren∣dezvous of the Army and Flect under King William, for the Conquest of Ire∣land Anno 1689, for here the Men of War▪ rode as our Ships do in the Downs, till the Transports came to them from Che∣ster and this Town.</P>
<P>The Sea Coast affords little remark∣able on the West Side of this Port, till we come farther North; so we left that Part of the County, and going East we came to Warrington: This is a large Market Town upon the River Mersee, over which is a stately Stone Bridge, which is the only Bridge of Communi∣cation for the whole County with the County of Chester; it is on the great Road from London leading to Carlisle and Scotland, and, in Case of War, has always been esteemed a Pass of the ut∣most Importance. It was found to be so upon several extraordinary Occasions in the time of the late Civil War; and had the Rebels advanced thus far in the late Preston Affair, so as to have made them∣selves Masters of it, it would have been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o again; and on that Account, the King's Forces took special Care, by a speedy ad∣vance to secure it.</P>
<P>Warrington is a large, populous old <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uilt Town, but rich and full of good Country Tradesmen. Here is particular∣ly a weekly Market for Linnen, as I saw at Wrexham in Wales, a Market for Flannel. The Linnen sold at this Market is, generally speaking, a sort of Table Linnen, called Huk-a-back or Huk-a-buk; 'tis well known among the good Housewives, so I need not describe it. I was told there are generally as many Pieces of this Linnen sold here every Market Day as amounts to five hundred Pounds value, sometimes much more, and all made in the Neighbourhood of the Place.</P>
<P>From hence, on the Road to Manche∣ster, we pass'd the great Bog or Waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England, from any of the South Parts hither. It extends on the Left-hand of the Road for five or six Miles East and West, I was told it was, in some Places, seven or eight Miles from North to South. The Nature of these Mosses, for we found there are many of them in this Country is this, and you will take this for a Description of all the rest.</P>
<P>The Surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and is indeed frightful to think of, for it will bear neither Horse or Man, unless in an exceeding dry Season, and then not so as to be passable, or that any one should travel over them.</P>
<P>The Substance of the Surface seems to be a Collection of the small Roots of innumerable Vegetables matted together, interwoven so thick, as well the bigger Roots as the smaller Fibres, that it makes a Substance hard enough to cut out in∣to Turf, or rather Peat, which, in some Places, the People cut out, and piling them up in the Sun, dry them for their Fewel. The Roots I speak of are generally small and soft not unlike the Roots of Asparagus or of Bearbind, they have no Earth among them, except what they contract from the Air, and Dust fly∣ing in it, but the Rain keeps them, as it were, always growing, though not much encreasing.</P>
<P>In some Places the Surface of this kind lies thicker, in some not very thick. We
<PB REF="430"/>
saw it in some Places eight or nine Foot thick, and the Water that dreins from it look'd clear, but of a deep brown, like stale Beer. What Nature meant by such a useless Production, 'tis hard to imagine; but the Land is entirely waste, above, except, as above, for the poor Cottagers fuel, and the Quantity used for that is very small.</P>
<P>Under this Moss, or rather in the very Body of it, not here only, but in several like Places, and perhaps in all of them, those antient Fir Trees are found, of which so much dispute has been what they are or were, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> how th y should come there. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mob <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is sometimes expended upon these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which, in my weak <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to no more than this; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Na∣ture, whose Works are all directed by a superior Hand, has been guided to pro∣duce Trees here under Ground, as she does in other Places above Ground; that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se live rather than grow, though 'tis manifest they encrease too, otherwise they would not be found of so great a B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk; that as the Trees above the Surface grow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct and high, these he hori∣zontal; those shoot forth Branches and Leaves; these shoot forth no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranches or Leaves, yet have a Vegetation by Me∣thods directed by Nature, and particularly to that kind; and 'tis remarkable, that as if they lie buried they will grow and en∣crease, so if you take them up, and plant them in the Air, they will wither and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; and why should this be more strange than that a Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h will strangle in the Air, and a bird drown in the Water, or than that every thing lives in its proper Ele∣ment, and will not-live, or at least not thrive out of it.</P>
<P>It is observale, that these Trees are a kind of Fir, and very full of Turp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tine. Whether there is any Tar in them I am not positive, but I suppose there it. And yet I do not see, that for this Reason they should not be a natural ordinar Pro∣duct, as other Vegetables are.</P>
<P>If it be enquired, why no kind of Trees should grow thus but Fir; it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be as well ask'd, why no Stone <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> such or such Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Marble, or in others than Free <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Na∣ture alone can re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove that part.</P>
<P>As to then being brought hither by the general Convulsion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Deluge, the Thought is so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Thing, so incong<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uons, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> nether needs or deserves any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>

<P>The College was first founded, A. D. 1421. by Thomas de la Ware, at first, Rector of the said Parish Church, and Brother to the Lord De la Ware, whom
<PB REF="432"/>
he succeeded in the Estate and Honour; and then himself founded a College there, consisting of one Master or Keeper, eight Fellows Chaplains, four Clerks, and six Choristers, in Honour of St. Mary, (to whom the said Parish Church was for∣merly dedicated) St. Dennis of France, St. George of England.</P>
<P>This Foundation was dissolved 1547, in the first Year of King Edward VI. the Lands and Revenues of it taken in∣to the King's Hands, and by him de∣mised to the Farl of Derby, and the Col∣lege-House, and some Lands sold to the said Earl.</P>
<P>After this, the College was refounded by Queen Mary, who restored most of the Lańds and Revenues, only the Col∣lege itself, and some of its Revenues, re∣mained still in the Hands of the Earl of Derby.</P>
<P>It was also founded anew by Queen E∣lizabeth, A. D. 1578. by the Name of Christ's College, in Manchester, consisting of one Warden, four Fellows, two Chap∣lains, four Singing Men, and four Cho∣risters, the Number being lessened, be∣cause the Revenues were so; chiefly by the Covetousness and base Dealing of Thomas Herle, then Warden, and his Fellows, who sold away, or made such long Leases of the Revenues, as could, never yet some of them, be retrieved.</P>
<P>It was last of all refounded by King Charles the First, A. D. 1636. consisting then of one Warden, four Fellows, two Chaplains, four Singing-Men, and four Choristers, and incorporating them, as before, by the Name of the Warden and Fellows of Christ's College in Manche∣ster, the Statutes for the same being drawn up by Archbishop Laud.</P>
<P>The Hospital was founded by Hum∣phry Cheetham Esq; and incorporated by King Charles the Second, designed by the said bountiful Benefactor for the Maintenance of forty poor Boys out of the Town and Parish of Manchester, and some other neighbouring Parishes; but since 'tis enlarged to the Number of sixty, by the Governors of the said Hos∣pital, to be taken in between the of six and ten, and there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Meat, Drink, Lodging and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Age of fourteen, and then to bound Apprentices to some honest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Calling, at the Charge of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the Maintenance of which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> endowed it with the yearly Re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e▪ 420 l. which is since improve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> care and good husbandry of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Governours, to the yearly Sum <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 517 l. 8 s. 4d. they having laid out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Purchase of Lands the Sum of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which was saved out of the Yearly i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣come, over and above the Maintenan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the poor Children, and others, belong∣ing to the said Hospital, wherein the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there are annually near seventy Per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> provided for.</P>
<P>By the Bounty of the said Fouude is also erected a very fair and spacio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Library, already furnished with a com∣petent Stock of choice and valuable Books to the number near Four Thousand, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> daily increasing with the income of 116<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per Ann. settled upun the same by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said worthy Benefactor, to buy Book for ever, and to afford a competent Sa∣lary for a Library Keeper. There is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a large School for the Hospital Boys where they are daily instructed, and taugh to read and write.</P>
<P>The Publick School was founded A. D. 1519. by Hugh Oldham, D. D. and Bi∣shop of Exeter, who bought the Land on which the School stand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and too<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Mills there in Lease of the Lord D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> la Ware, for sixty Years; afterwards with the Bishop's Money, Hugh Benwick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Joan his Sister, purchased of the Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> De la Ware, his Land in Awcoates, and the Mills upon Right and Left of them in Feossment to the said Free School for ever, which Revenues are of late very much encreased by the Feo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of the School; who, out of the improvements have as well considerably augmented the Masters Salaries, as the Exhibitions an∣nually allowed to the maintenance o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such Scholars at the University, as the Warden of the College and the High
<PB REF="433"/>
Master shall think requisite, and have besides, for some Years past, added a third Master, for whom they have lately erected a new and convenient School at the end of the other.</P>
<P>Besides these publick Benefactions and Endowments, there have been several other considerable Sums of Money, and annual Revenues, left and bequeathed to the Poor of the said Town, who are thereby, with the Kindness and Charity of the present Inhabitants, competently provided for▪ without starving at home, or being forced to seek Relief abroad.</P>
<P>As for the Antiquity of the Place, I have no room to mention it here, though the Authors who have mentioned it say much of that Part too; nor is it my Business, the Antiquity of the Manufac∣ture indeed is what is of most Conside∣ration; and this, though we cannot trace it by History, yet we have reason to believe it began something earlier than the great Woollen Manufactures in other Parts of England, of which I have spo∣ken so often, because the Cotton might it self come from the Mediterranean, and be known by Correspondents in those Countries, when that of Wool was not push'd at because our Neighbours wrought the Goods, and though they bought the Wool from England, yet we did not want the Goods, whereas, without ma∣king the Cotton Goods at home, our People could not have them at all; and that Necessity, which is the Mother of invention, might put them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne; where∣as having not the same Necessity, Igno∣rance and Indolence prevented the other.</P>
<P>I am the rather of this Opinion too, because Mr. Cambden speaks of this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too, by the Name of Manche∣ster <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and that being written in Q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>zabeth h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s time, when the Wool∣len Manufacture was, though much im∣proved, yet, as we may lay, in its In∣fancy, or, at least, not at full Age; we may reasonably believe, that Cotton was the elder Manufacture of the two, and that by some considerable Time. This Manufacture of Manchester Cottons, as it seems they were then call'd, I suppose is the same that is now call'd Fustian or Dimity, or that both these are but dif∣ferent kinds of the other.</P>
<P>I cannot doubt but this encreasing Town will, some time or other, obtain some better Face of Government, and be incorporated, as it very well deserves to be.</P>
<P>The River Irwell runs close by this Town, and receives the little River Irke just above the Town, on the North and North East Side. There is a very firm, but ancient Stone Bridge over the Irwell, which is built exceeding high▪ because this River, though not great, yet com∣ing from the mountainous Part of the Country, swells sometimes so suddenly, that in one Night's time they told me the Waters would frequently rise four or five Yards, and the next Day fall as hastily as they rose.</P>
<P>The Author of the Geographical Dic∣tionary places this Town upon the Bank of the River Spolden, which Mr. Camb∣den's Continuator, mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o often, takes notice of it as a Mistake, and so it is; but I suppose 'twas occasioned by this: There is a River named Spodden, not Spolden, which rising under Black∣stone Edge, runs into the Roch at Roch∣dale, and so losing its Name in the Roch, runs into the Irwell, about Ratchff, six or seven Miles above Manchester, and, in some Maps, they have made not the Spodden loss its Name in the Roch, but the Roch in the Spodden, and so give it yet its own Name after i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> joins the Irwell, and on to Manchester.</P>
<P>About eight Mile from Manchester, North West, lies Bolton, the Town which gives Title to the noble Family of Pow∣let, Dukes of Bolton, raised to the heighth of Duke by the late King William, at the same time, or near it, with the Dukes of Bed∣ford, Devonshire, Rutland, and Newcastle. We saw nothing remarkable in this Town,
<PB REF="434"/>
but that the Cotton Manufacture reached hither; but the Place did not, like Man∣chester, seem so flourishing and encreas∣ing.</P>
<P>On the Left-hand of this Town, West, even to the Sea shore, there are not ma∣ny Towns of note, except Wiggon▪ on the high Post Road, and Ormskirk, near which we saw Latham House, famous for its being not only gallantly defended in the Times of the late fatal Wars, but that it was so by a Woman; for the La∣dy Charlotte, Countess of Derby, de∣fended the House to the last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Parliament Forces; nor could she ever be brought to capitualate, but kept the Hold till Prince Rupert, with a strong Body of the King's Army, came to her Relief, and obliged the Enemy to raise their Siege, Anno 1644: It was in∣deed ruin'd in a second Siege, and is not yet fully recovered from the Calamity of it.</P>
<P>In this Town Bolton the old Earl of Derby was beheaded by the Parliament, or by the Army rather, in the time of those fatal Wars, October 15, 1651.</P>
<P>In the Neighbourhood of this Town, that is to say, between Wiggan and Bol∣ton, in the Estate of Sir Roger Bradshaw, is found that kind of Coal they call Canell or Candle Coal, which, tho' they are found here in great plenty, and are very cheap, are yet very singular; for there are none such to be seen in Britain, or perhaps in the World besides: They so soon take Fire, that, by putting a lighted Candle to them, they are presently in a Flame, and yet hold Fire as long as any Coals whatever, and more or less, as they are placed in the Grate or Hearth, whether flat or edg'd, whether right up and down, and polar, or level and hori∣zontal.</P>
<P>They are smooth and slick when the Pieces part from one another, and will polish like Alabaster; then a Lady may take them up in a Cambrick Handkerchief and they will not soil it, though they are as black as the deepest Jet. They are the most pleasant agreeable▪ Fuel that can be found, but they are remote; and th ugh some of them have been brought to Lon∣don, yet they are so dear, by reason of the Carriage, that few care to buy them; we saw some of them at Warrington too, but all from the same Pits.</P>
<P>We saw nothing remarkable in Orms∣kirk but the Monuments of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Family of the Stanly's, before they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Title of Earls of Derby. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are all buried, and have some very fine, tho' antient, and even d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Re∣mains of Monuments; and here they con∣tinue to bury the Family still, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Seat of Latham, as I said before, is but hard by▪ Mr Cambden gives a full A c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt how Latham House, and a great Estate with it, came to the Earls of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Marriage, and has continued <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Fa∣mily to this Day.</P>
<P>It is not to be forgot that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is near Winnick, a small Town, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a large Parish, and great Benefice; but tho' it might be the greatest in England in those Days, 'tis very far from being now so; for we never heard that it was worth above 800l. per Annum, whereas Sedg∣field, near Durham▪ is valued at this time at 1200l. per Annum at least.</P>
<P>I must not pass over here the Burning Well, as 'tis called, near Wiggan, though I must acknowledge, that being turned from Bolton towards Rochdale, before I heard any thing of it that I gave any Credit to, I did not go back to see it; not that I had not Curiosity enough, if I had been satisfied it was valuable, but the Country People, who usually enlarge up∣on such Things rather than lessen them, made light of this; and so I cool'd in my Curiosity.</P>
<P>But the Account given in publick of it is also so particular, that it abundantly makes amends to me for my not seeing it. Mr. Cambden's Continuator gives the fol∣lowing Account of it:</P>
<P>Within a Mile and a half of Wiggan is a Well, which does not appear to be a Spring but reather Rain Water, at first

There is nothing about it▪ that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eems extraordinary, but, upon emptying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, there presently breaks out a sulphure∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Vapour, which makes the Water bub∣ble up as if it boiled; a Candle being put <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o it, it presently takes fire, and burns <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike Brandy; the Flame, in a calm Sea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, will continue a whole Day, by the Heat whereof they can boil Eggs, Meat, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> though the Water it self be cold. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y this bubbling the Water does not en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ease, but is only kept in Motion by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onstant Halitus of the Vapours break∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g out; the same Water taken out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell will not burn, as neither the Mud <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on which the Halitus has beat.</P>

Here is a great deal of good Company, but not so much, they say, as was before the late bloody Action with the Northern Rebels; not that the Battle hurt many of the immediate Inha∣bitants, but so many Families there and thereabout, have been touched by the Consequences of it, that it will not be re∣covered in a few Years, and they seem to have a kind of remenbrance of Things upon them still.</P>
<P>Lancaster is the next, the County Town, and situate near the Mouth of the River Lone or Lune. The Town is antient; it lies, as it were, in its own Ruins, and has little to recommend but a decayed Castle, and a more decayed Port (for no Ships of any considerable Burthen) the Bridge is handsome and strong, but, as be∣fore, here is little or no Trade, and few People. It surprised me to hear that there is not above sixty Parishes in all this large County, but many of them are necessarily very large.</P>
<P>This Part of the Country seemed very strange after coming out of so rich, popu∣lous and fruitful a Place, as I have just now described; for here we were, as it were, lock'd in between the Hills on one Side high as the Clouds, and prodigiously higher, and the Sea on the other, and the Sea it self seemed desolate and wild, for it was a Sea without Ships, here being no Sea Port or Place of Trade, especially for Merchants; so that, except Colliers pasting between Ireland and Whitehaven with Coals, the People told us they should not see a Ship under Sail for many Weeks together.</P>
<P>Here, among the Mountains, our Curi∣osity was frequently moved to enquire what high Hill this was, or that; and
<PB REF="436"/>
we soon were saluted with that old Verse which I remembered to have seen in Mr. Cambden, viz.</P>
<P>Inglebrough, Pendle-hill and Penigent, Are the highest Hills between Scot∣land and Trent.</P>
<P>Indeed, they were, in my Thoughts, mon∣strous high, but in a Country all moun∣tainous and full of innumerable high Hills, it was not easy for a Traveller to judge which was highest.</P>
<P>Nor were these Hills high and formi∣dable only, but they had a kind of an un∣hospitable Terror in them. Here were no rich pleasant Valleys between them, as among the Alps; no Lead Mines and Veins of rich Oar, as in the Peak; no Coal Pits, as in the Hills about Hallifax, much less Gold, as in the Andes, but all barren and wild, of no Use or Advan∣tage either to Man or Beast. Indeed here was formerly, as far back as Q. Eliza∣beth, some Copper Mines, and they wrought them to a good Advantage; but whether the Vein of Oar fail'd, or what else was the Reason, we know not, but they are all given over long since, and this Part of the Country yields little or no∣thing at all.</P>
<P>But I must not forget Winander Meer, which makes the utmost Northern Bounds of this Shire, which is famous for the Char Fish found here and hereabout, and no where else in England; it is found in∣deed in some of the Rivers or Lakes in Swisserland among the Alps, and some say in North Wales; but I question the last. It is a curious Fish, and, as a Dain∣ty is Potted, and fent far and near, as Presents to the best Friends; but the Quantity they take also is not great Mr. Cambden's Continuator calls it very happily the Golden Alpine Trour.</P>
<P>Here we entred Westmoreland, a Coun∣try eminent only for being the Wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even in Wales it self; the West Side, which bor∣ders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a Chain of almost mountains, which▪ in the Language of the Country, are cal∣led Fells, and these are called Fourness Fells, from the famous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tory bear∣ing that Name, and an Abbey built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in ancient Times, and called Fourness</P>

Gentleman or Nobleman in Britain is Ma∣ster of.</P>
<P>When we entred at the South part of this County, I began indeed to think of Merionethshire, and the Mountains of Snowden in North Wales, seeing nothing round me, in many Places, but unpas∣sable Hills, whose Tops, covered with Snow, seemed to tell us all the pleasant Part of England was at an end. The great Winauder Meer, like the Mediter∣ranean Sea, extends it self on the West Side for twelve Miles and more, reckon∣ing from North Bridge on the South, where it contracts it self again into a River up to Gresmere North, and is the Boundary of the County, as I have said, on that Side; and the English Appenine, as Mr. Cambden calls them, that is, the Mountains of Yorkshire North Riding, he like a Wall of Brass on the other; and indeed, in one Sense, they are a Wall of Brass; for it is the Opinion of the most skilful and knowing People in the Coun∣try, that those Moun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ins are full of in∣exhaustible Mines of Copper, and so rich, as not only to be called Brass, Copper, being convertible into Brass, but also to have a Quantity of Gold in them also: It is true, they do at this time work at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome Copper Mines here, but they find the Oar lies so deep, and is so hard to come a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ that they do not seem to go cheerfully on.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding this terrible aspect of the Hills, when having passed by Ken∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dal, and descending the frightful Moun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ains, began to find the Flat Country show <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t self; we soon saw that the North and North East Part of the County was plea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant, rich, fruitful, and, compared to the other Part, populous. The River Eden, he last River of England on this Side, as he Tyne is on the other, r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses in this Part out of the Side of a monstrous high Mountain, called Mowill Hill, or Wild∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore Fell▪ which you please; after which, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> runs through the middle of this Vale, which is, as above, a very agreeable and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leasant Country, or perhaps seems to be so the more, by the horror of the East∣ern and Southern Part.</P>
<P>In this Vale, and on the Bank of this River, stands Appleby, once a flourish∣ing City, now a scattering, decayed, and half-demolished Town, the fatal Effects of the ancient Inroads of those Scots, when this being a Frontier County, those Invasions were frequent, and who several times were Masters of this Town, and at length burnt it to the Ground, which Blow it has not yet recovered.</P>
<P>The Searchers after Antiquity find much more to recreate their Minds, and satisfy their Curiosity, in these Northern Coun∣tries than in those farther South, which are more populous and better inhabited, because the Remains of ancient Things have met with less Injury here, where there are not so many People, or so ma∣ny Buildings, or Alterations, Enclosings and Plantings, as in other Places; but, for my Purpose, who am to give the present State of Things, here is not much to observe; nor are there many Houses or Seats of the Nobility in this Part, tho' many ancient Families dwell here, as particularly Strickland, from the Lands of Strickland, Wharton from Wharton Hall, Louther from the River Louther, as above, Warcop of Warcop, Langdale of Langdale, Musgrave from Musgrave, and many others.</P>
<P>The Roman Highway, which I have so often mentioned, and which, in my last Letter, I left at Leeming Lane and Peers Brigg, in the North Riding of York, en∣ters this County from Rear Cross upon Stanmore, and crossing it almost due East and West, goes through Appleby, passing the Eden a little North from Perith, at an ancient Roman Station call'd Provoni∣acam, where there was a large and stately Stone Bridge; but now the great Road leads to the Left-hand to Perith, in go∣ing to which we first pass the Eden, at a very good Stone Bridge call'd Louther Bridge, and then the Elnot over another.</P>
<P>Perith, or Penrith, is a handsome Mar∣ket Town, populous, well built▪ and, for an
<PB REF="438"/>
Inland Town, has a very good share of Trade. It was unhappily possessed by the late Party of Scots Highland Rebels, when they made that desperate Push in∣to England, and which ended at Preston. In the Moor or Heath, on the North part of this Town, the Militia of the County making a brave Appearance, and infinitely out-numbering the Highlanders, were drawn up; yet, with all their bra∣very, they ran away, as soon as the Scots began to advance to Charge them, and never fired a Gun at them, leaving the Town at their Mercy. However, to do Justice even to the Rebels, they offered no Injury to the Town, only quartered in it one Night, took what Arms and Ammunition they could find, and advanc∣ed towards Kendal.</P>
<P>From hence, in one Stage, through a Country full of Castles, for almost every Gentleman's House is a Castle, we came to Carlisle, a small, but well fortified Ci∣ty, the Frontier Place and Key of Eng∣land on the West Sea, as Berwick upon Tweed is on the East; and in both which there have, for many Years, I might say Ages, been strong Garrisons kept to check the invading Scots; from below this Town the famous Picts Wall began, which cross'd the whole Island to New∣castle upon Tyne, where I have mention∣ed it already.</P>
<P>Here also the great Roman Highway, just before named, has its End, this being the utmost Station of the Roman Soldiers on this Side.</P>
<P>But before I go on to speak of this Town, I must go back, as we did for our particular Satisfaction, to the Sea Coast, which, in this Northern County, is more remarkable than that of Lanca∣shire, though the other is extended much farther in length; for here are some Towns of good Trade; whereas in Lan∣cashire, Liverpoole excepted, there is no∣thing of Trade to be seen upon the whole Coast.</P>
<P>I enquired much for the Pearl Fishery here, wich Mr. Cambden speaks of, as a thing well known about Ravenglass and the River Ire, which was made a kind of Bubble lately: But the Country People, nor even the Fishermen, could give us no Account of any such thing; nor indeed is there any great Quantity of the Shell∣fish to be found here (now) in which the Pearl are found, I mean the large Oyster or Muscle. What might be in former Times, I know not.</P>
<P>The Cape or Head Land of St. Bees, still preserves its Name; as for the La∣dy, like that of St. Tabbs beyond Ber∣wick, the Story is become fabulous, viz. about her procuring, by her Prayers, a deep Snow on Midsummer Day, her taming a wild Bull that did great Damage in the Country; these, and the like Tales, I leave where I found them, (viz.) a∣mong the Rubbish of the old Women and the Romish Priests,</P>
<P>In the little Town, which bears her Name there, is a very good Free School, founded by that known and eminent Be∣nefactor to, and Promoter of pious De∣signs, Archbishop Grindal; it is endowed very well by him, and the Charity much encreased by the late Dr. Lamplugh, Arch∣bishop of York: The Library annexed to this Foundation is very valuable, and still encreasing by several Gifts daily added to it; and they show a List of the Bene∣factors, in which are several Persons of Honour and Distinction. The Master is put in by the Provost and Fellows of Queen's College in Oxon.</P>
<P>Under this Shore, the Navigation be∣ing secured by this Cape of St. Bees, is the Town of Whitehaven, grown up from a small Place to be very considerable by the Coal Trade, which is encreased so considerably of late, that it is now the most eminent Port in England for ship∣ping off Coals, except Newcastle and Sunderland, and even beyond the last, for they wholly supply the City of Dublin▪ and all the Towns of Ireland on that Coast; and 'tis frequent in time of War, or upon the ordinary Occasion of cross Winds, to have two hundred Sail of Ships at a Time go from this Place for Dublin, loaded with Coals.</P>
<P><PB REF="439"/>
They have of late fallen into some Merchandizing also, occasioned by the great Number of their Shipping, and there are now some considerable Merchants; but the Town is yet but young in Trade, and that Trade is so far from being an∣cient, that Mr. Cambden does not so much as name the Place, and his Con∣tinuator says very little of it.</P>
<P>About ten Miles from Whitehaven North East, lies Cockermouth, upon the little River Cocker, just where it falls in∣to the Derwent. This Derwent is famous for its springing out of those Hills, cal∣led Derwent Fells, where the ancient Copper Mines were found in Queen Eli∣zabeth's Time, and in which, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, there was a large Quantity of Gold. But they are discontinued since that Time, for what Reason, I know not; for there are several Copper Mines now working in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his County, and which, as they told <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> turn to very good Account</P>
<P>Some tell us, the Copper Mines on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erwent Fells were discontinued, because <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere being Gold found among the Oar, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Queen claimed the Royalty, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> body would work them; which seems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be a Reason why they should have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> applied to the Search with more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but be that how it will, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off, and the more probable account <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what a Gentleman of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rith gave us, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the Charge of working them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too great for the Profits.</P>
<P>Here are still Mines of black Lead <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which turn to very good Account, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for ought I have yet learned, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place in Britain where it is to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Here we saw Skiddaw, one of those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hills of which, wherever you come, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People always say, they are the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in England Skiddaw indeed is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high Hill, but seems the higher, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not surrounded with other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as in the Case in most Places where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other Hills are, as at Cheviot, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and at other Places. From the of Skiddaw they see plainly into Soct∣land, and quite into Dumfries-shire, and farther.</P>
<P>Cockermouth stands upon this River Derwent, about twelve Miles from the Sea, but more by the Windings of the River, yet Vessels of good Burthen may come up to it. The Duke of Somerset is Chief Lord of this Town, in Right of his Lady, the only Heiress of the an∣cient Family of the Piercy's, Earls of Norrhumberland, and which the Duke of Somerset enjoys now in Right of Mar∣riage.</P>
<P>The Castles and great Houses of this Estate go every where to Ruin, as indeed all the Castles in this County do; for there being no more Enemy to be expec∣ted here, the two Kingdoms being now united into one, there is no more need of strong Holds here, than in any other Part of the Kingdom. At Cockermouth there is a Castle which belongs to the same Family, and, I think they told us, the Duke has no less than thirteen Castles in all, here and in Northumber∣land.</P>
<P>This River Derwent is noted for very good Salmon, and for a very great Quan∣tity, and Trout. Hence, that is, from Workington at the Mouth of this River, and from Carlifle, not withstanding the great Distance, they at this Time carry Salmon (fresh as they take it) quite to London. This is performed with Horses, which, changing often, go Night and Day without Intermission, and, as they say, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>very much out-go the Post; so that the Fish come very sweet and good to London, where the extraordinary Price they yield, being often sold at two Shil∣lings and Sixpence to four Shillings per Pound, pay very well for the Carriage.</P>
<P>They have innumerable Marks of An∣tiquity in this County, as well as in that of Westmoreland, mentioned before; and if it was not, as I said before, that Anti∣quity is not my Search in this Work, yet the Number of Altars, Monuments, and Incriptions, is such, that it would take up a larger Work than this to copy them, and record them by themselves;
<PB REF="440"/>
yet, passing these, I could not but take notice of two or three modern Things, and which relate to our own Nation: as,</P>
<P N="1">1. That of Hart-Horn Tree, where they shew'd us the Head of a Stag nail'd up against a Tree, or rather shew'd us the Tree where they said it was nail'd up, in Memory of a famous Chase of a Stag by one single Dog. It seems the Dog (not a Greyhound, as Mr. Camb∣den's Continuator calls it, but a stanch Buck hound, to be sure) singly chass'd a Stag from this Place, (Whitfield Park) as far as the Red Kirk in Scotland, which, they say, is sixty Miles at least, and back again to the same Place, where, be∣ing both spent, and at the last Gasp, the Stag strain'd all its Force remaining to leap the Park Pales, did it, and dy'd on the inside; the Hound, attempting to leap after him, had not Strength to get over, but fell back, and dy'd on the Outside just opposite; after which the Heads of both were nail'd up upon the Tree, and this Distich made on them; the Hound's Name, it seems, was Hercules.</P>
<Q><L>Hercules kill'd Hart a Greese,</L>
<L>And Hart a Greese kill'd Hercules.</L></Q>
<P N="2">2. Another thing they told us was in the same Park, viz. three Oak Trees which were call'd The Three Brether, the least of which was thirteen Yards about; but they own'd there was but one of them left, and only the Stump of that; so we did not think it worth going to see, because it would no more confirm the Wonder, than the Peoples affirming it by Tradition only. The Tree or Stump left, is call'd The Three Brether Tree, that is to say, one of the three Bro∣thers, or Brethren.</P>
<P N="3">3. West of this Hart▪horn Tree, and upon the Roman Way, is the famous Column, called the Countess Pillar, the best and most beautiful Piece of its kind in Britain. It is a fine Column of Free-Stone, finely wrought enchas'd, and in some places Painted. There is an Obe∣lisk on the Top, several Coats of Arms and other Ornaments in proper Plac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all over it, with Dials also on every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and a Brass Plate with the following <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t scription upon it:</P>

<P>N.

<P>But though I am backward to dip in∣to Antiquity, yet no English Man, that has any Honour for the glorious Memory of the greatest and truest Hero of all our Kings of the English or Saxon Race, can go to Carlisle, and not step aside to see the Monument of King Edward I. at Burgh upon the Sands, a little Way out of the City Carlisle, where that victorious Prince dy'd. Indeed I cannot wonder that two Writers, both Scots, viz. R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dpath and Mr. Kay, should leave it, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were, not worth their Notice, that Prince being the Terror of Scotland, and the first compleat Conqueror of their Kingdom, who brought away the sacred Scone at Scone-Abbey, on which their Kings were crown∣ed, also the Regalia, and in a Word, made their whole Country submit to his victo∣rious Arms.</P>
<P>Near this Town, and, as the inhabi∣tants affirm, just on the spot where the King's Tent stood in which he expired, for he died in the Camp, is erected a Pil∣lar of Stone near thirty Foot high, besides the Foundation. On the West Side is the following inscription:</P>

great heap of Stones rolled together upon the Place; but this Monument was erect∣ed, as is said above, by a private Gentle∣man, for the eternal Memory of a Prince, who, when he lived, was the Darling of the World, both for Virtue and true Fame.</P>
<P>But I return to Carlisle: The City is strong, but small, the Buildings old, but the Streets fair; the great Church is a venerable old Pile, it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have been built at twice, or▪ as it were rebuilt, the upper Part being much more modern than the lower.</P>
<P>King Henry VIII fortiyfy'd this City against the Scots, and built an additional Castle to it on the East Side, which Mr. Cambden, though I think not justly calls a Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adel; there is indeed another Castle on the West Part of the Town rounds th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea, as the Wall rounds the whole, is very firm and strong But Carlisle is strong by Situation, being almost sur∣rounded with Rivers. On the East it has the River Poterell, on the North Eden, and on the South the Cande, or Canda, or Calda, which all fall into the Arm of the Sea, which they call the Solway, or Firth.</P>
<P>Here is a Bridge over the Eden, which soon lets you into Scotland; for the Limits are not above eight Miles off▪ or thereabout. The South Part of Scotland on this Side, coming at least fifty Miles farther into England, than at Berwick. There is not a great deal of Trade here either by Sea or Land, it being a meer Frontier. On the other Side the Eden we saw the Picts Wall, of which I have spoken already, and some Remains of it are to be seen farther West, and of which I shall perhaps have Occasion to speak again in my Return. But being now at the utmost Extent of England on this Side, I conclude also my Tenth Jour∣ney.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THE ACCOUNT, AND Description, of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO all the Descriptions of Scotland, which have been publish'd in our Day, have been written by Natives of that Country, and that with such an Air of the most scandalous Partiality, that it has been far from pleasing the Gentry or No∣bility of Scotland themselves, and much farther has it been from doing any Ho∣nour to the Nation or the Country.</P>
<P>One known Author has taken Pains to describe their Commerce as an immense Thing for Magnitude, has set off their Manufactures in such a Figure, and as such
<PB REF="445"/>
extraordinary Things, that the English are Trifles to them, and their merchan∣dizing, according to his Account, must be inferior to very few, if any Nation in Europe; nay, he is not asham'd to give us an Account of the Particulars of their Exportations to China and the East Indies, to Turkey, and the Levant, where, I be∣lieve, never Scots Ship yet sail'd, unless it was in the Service of English Mer∣chants, or some other foreign Nation.</P>
<P>A more modern, and, I must acknow∣ledge, more modest Writer than this, knowing he could not, with a Front that, perhaps, he had not yet arrived to, set forth his Country to her Advantage, by giving a real Description of that Part which would necessarily shew her Defici∣encies, as well as her Beauties; and re∣taining still that Piece of Northern Vani∣ty peculiar to the Climate, to think mighty well of his own Country, takes up with describing the Seats of the Nobility and Gentry; a Subject, which, it must be con∣fess'd, gives him a greater Scope, and in which he has good Materials to work on: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut, even in this, it must be added he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have done better, if he would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave given the Noblemen and Gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Scotland leave to have known their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn Houses again, when they saw his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>escription of them.</P>
<P>I have so much Honour for the Noble∣men and Gentlemen of Scotland, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> persuaded they will be as well pleas'd <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see Justice done them and their Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, as to see themselves flatter'd, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld impos'd upon about them. Their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untry is not so void of Beauty, or their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons of Merit, as to want; and (I be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve) they will not seek to be flatter'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be obliged by it, when 'tis attemp∣d</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the World shall, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> once, hear what Account an English-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n shall give of Scotland, who has had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion to see most of it, and to make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ical Enquiries into what he has not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and, if describing it, as it really is, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as in Time it may be, with probable Reasons for the Variation, will give Satis∣faction to the Scots. They will be oblig∣ed; on the contrary I shall neither flatter them or deceive them. Scotland is here describ'd with Brevity, but with Justice; and the present <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Things there, placed in as clear a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as the Sheets, I am confined to, wil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if this pleases, mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may be adventured on hereafter; if it should not, it would make me suspect the other Authors I have men∣tioned knew what would please their Country-men better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I; But I must run the Venture of that, rather than tres∣pass upon my own Truth and their Mo∣desty.</P>
<P>I hope it is no Reflection upon Scot∣land to say they are where we were, I mean as to the Improvement of their Country and Commerce; and they may be where we are.</P>
<P>Here are but a few Things needful to bring Scotland to be (in many Parts of it at least) as rich in Soil, as fruitful, as po∣pulous, as full of Trade, Shipping, and Wealth, as most, if not as the best Coun∣ties of England. These few Things, in∣deed, are such as are absolutely necessary, and, perhaps, as Things stand, may be difficult: Such as</P>
<P N="1">1. Time, publick Changes cannot be brought about in a Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Change in the Disposition of the common People, from a Desire of travelling abroad, and wandring from Home, to an industrious and diligent Application to Labour at Home.</P>
<P N="3">3. Stock and Substance, to encourage that Application: Sloth is not a meer Disease of the Nation: The Scots are as diligent, as industrious, as apt for Labour and Business, and as ca∣pable of it, when they are abroad, as any People in the World; and why should they not be so at Home? and, if they had Encouragement, no doubt they would.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="446" MS="y"/>
4. Some little Alteration in their Me∣thods of Husbandry, by which their Lands would be improv'd, and the Produce thereof turn better to Ac∣count; of all which something may be said in our Progress thro' the Country, as Occasion presents.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as I shall not make a Paradise of Scotland, so I assure you I shall not make a Wilderness of it. I shall endeavour to shew you what it really is, what it might be, and what, perhaps, it would much sooner have been, if some People's Engagements were made good to them, which were lustily promised a little before the Union: Such as erect∣ing Manufactures there under English Direction, embarking Stocks from Eng∣land to carry on Trade, employing Hands to cut down their Northern Woods, and make Navigations to bring the Firr Tim∣ber, and Deals to England, of which Scot∣land is able to furnish an exceeding Quan∣tity; encouraging their Fishery, and abun∣dance of fine Things mote which were much talked of I say, but little down; and of which I could say more, but it is not the Business of this Work, nor per∣haps, will the Age care to hear it, at least, South by <HI>Tw</HI>—</P>
<P>I must, therefore, be contented to give an Account of Scotland in the present State of it, and as it really is; leaving its Misfortunes, and Want of being im∣prov'd as it might be, and, perhaps, ought to have been, for those to consider of, in whose Power it is to mend it.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY XI.</HEAD>
<P>I Am now just entered Scotland, and that by the ordinary Way from Ber∣wick. We tread upon Scots Ground, after about three Miles riding be∣yond Berwick; the little District between, they say, is neither in England or Scot∣land, and is call'd Berwickshire, as being formerly a Dependant upon the Town of Berwick; but we find no Towns in it, only strangling Farm Houses; and one sees the Tweed on one Side, which fetches a Reach Northward, the Sea on the other, and the Land between lies so high, that in stormy Weather 'tis very bleak and unpleasant; however, the Land is good, and compar'd to our next View, we ought to think very well of it.</P>
<P>The first Town in Scotland is called Mordintown, where the Minister, at that Time, was a Man of Learning, particu∣larly in Matters of religious Antiquity, and very well known for being Author of a Book, Entituled, The <HI>Cyprtanick</HI> Age, in Defence of the Scots Doctrines of the Purity of the Christian Ministers; a Peice, that shews the Author a Man of a good share of Learning, and a double Stock of Reading, especially in the most valuable Part of Church Antiquity: His Name is Lauder.</P>
<P>Mordintown lying to the West, the great Road does not lie thro' it, but carries us to the Brow of a very high Hill, where we had a large View into Scotland: But we were welcom'd into it with such a Scots Gale of Wind, that, besides the Steepness of the Hill, it ob∣liged us to quit our Horses, for real Ap∣prehensions
<PB REF="447"/>
of being blown off, the Wind blowing full North, it blew directly in our Faces: And I can truly say, I never was sensible of so fierce a Wind, so ex∣ceeding keen and cold, for it pierc'd our very Eyes, that we could scarcely bear to hold them open.</P>
<P>When we came down the Hill, the Strength of the Wind was not felt so much, and consequently, not the Cold. The first Town we come to is as perfect¦ly Scots, as if you were 100 Miles North off Edinburgh; nor is there the least Ap∣pearance of any Thing English, either in Customs, Habits, Usages of the People, or in their Way of Living, Eating, Dress, or Behaviour; any more than if they had never heard of an English Nation; nor was there an Englishman to be seen, or any English Family to be found among them.</P>
<P>On the contrary, you have in Eng∣land abundance of Scotsmen▪ Scots Cu∣stoms, Words, Habits, and Usages, even more than becomes them; nay, even the Buildings in the Towns and Villages, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tate the Scots all over Northumber∣land; witness their building the Houses with the Stairs (to the second Floor) going up on the Outside of the House, so that one Family may live below, and another above, without going in at the same Door; which is the Scots Way of Living, and which we see in Alnwick and Warkworth, and several other Towns; witness also their setting their Corn up in great Numbers of small Stacks with∣o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Doors, not making Use of any Barns, only a particular Building, which they call a Barn, but, which is it itself no more than a Thresh ng Floor, into which they take one of those small Stacks at a Time, and thresh it out, and then take in an∣other; which we have great Reason to believe was the Usage of the Ancients, seeing we read of Threshing-Floors of∣ten; but very seldom, of a Barn, except that of the rich Glutton.</P>
<P>Being down this Hill, we pass'd a Bridge over the little River Eye, at the Mouth of which there is a small Harbour, with a Town call'd Eyemouth, or as some call it, Heymouth, which has of late been more spoken of thau formerly, by giv∣ing the Title of Baron to the late Duke of Marlborough, who was Duke of Marl∣borough, Marquiss of Blandford, and Ba∣ron of Eyemouth in Scotland; and, by virtue of this Title, had a Right of Peer∣age in the Parliament of Scotland. But notwithstanding all this, I never heard that he did any Thing for the Town, which is, at present, just what it always was, a good fishing Town, and some fishing Vessels belong to it; for such it is a good Harbour, and for little else; in Queen Elizabeth's Time, indeed, the French held it and fortify'd it for their particular Occasion; because, being the first Port in Scotland, they might safely land their Supplies for the Queen-Mother, who stood in great Need of their Assis∣stance against the Reformers: But they were oblig'd to quit both that and all the Kingdom some Time after, by a Treaty; Queen Elizabeth supporting the Reform∣ers against her.</P>
<P>From this Bridge we enter upon a most desolate, and, in Winter a most fright∣ful Moor for Travellers, especially Stran∣gers, call'd Condingham, or, to speak properly, Coldingham Moor; upon which, for about eight Miles, you see hardly a Hedge, or a Tree, except in one Part, and that at good Distance; nor do you meet with but one House in all the Way, and that no House of Entertainment; which, we thought, was but a poor Re∣ception for Scotland to give her Neigh∣bours, who were Strangers, at their very first Entrance into her Bounds.</P>
<P>The Place call'd Condingham, from whence this Moor derives, is an old Mo∣nastery, famous before the Reformation; the Monks of Coldingham being eminent for their Number and Wealth; as for any Thing else, this Deponent saith not.</P>
<P>Here was formerly a little Cell, or reli∣gious House also, sacred to the Me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory of St Ebbe, or Ebb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Daughter of King Edel∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id, King of Northumberland; who, her Father being taken Prisoner by the Pagan Mercians, got into a Boat in the Hum∣ber, with 3 Women, and by their Prayers,
<PB REF="448"/>
for Skill we may suppose, they had none, nor could they labour much; yet, put∣ting to Sea, were miraculously preserv'd, and carry'd as far as Scotland; where, under a great Promontory, they were driven on Shore by a Storm, and their Boat dash'd in Pieces, as, indeed, any one, though knowing the Place, might very well be, for the Shore is all Rock and high Precipices for a long Way.</P>
<P>However, being on Shore, they labour∣ed with their Hands, made themselves a little Hut to lodge in, and continu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g their devour Prayers, the Country Peo∣ple sustained them with Food, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an Opinion for their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> near for their Prayers, and, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the People, got enough to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> House at Colding¦ham.</P>
<P>Here, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> says, when the cruel Danes came <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shore▪ the religious La∣dy, who was wondrous beautiful too, it seems, cut off her Nose and upper Lip, and made all her Nuns do the same, to preserve, by that Means, their Chastity. But the barbarous Danes, enraged at them for their Zeal, fir'd their Nunnery, and burnt them all alive; from this Lady, who, it is said, was sainted for these Mi∣racles, the Promontory, where she land∣ed, is to this Day called St. Ebba's Head; and vulgarly by our Sailors who nick∣name every Thing, St. Tabbs.</P>
<P>Having pass'd this Desart, which in∣deed, makes a Stranger think Scotland a terrible Place, you come down a very steep Hill into the Lothains, so the Coun∣ties are divided, and they are spoken of in plural; because as Yorkshire is divided into the East and West Riding, so here is the East, and West, and Mid Lothain, or Louthain, and therefore justly called Lo∣thains in the plural,</P>
<P>From the Top of this Hill you begiu to see that Scotland is not all Desart; and the Low Lands, which then show them∣selves, give you a Prospect of a fruitful and pleasant Country: As soon as we come down the Hill, there is a Village called Cockburnspeth, vulgarly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where Nature forms a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and difficult Pass, and where, indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thousand Men well furnished, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> doing their Duty, would keep out an Army, if there was Occasion.</P>

<P>The Truth is, the Soil hereabout very good; and tho' they have not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Chalk, or much Lun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and manure it, yet, the Sea▪wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> call the Weeds, which the Sea casts <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abundantly supplies; and by l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> continually on the Land, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Year without laying their Lands fall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB REF="449"/>
as we do; and I found they had as much Corn, as our Plowmen express it, as could stand upon the Ground.</P>
<P>The first Town of Note, from hence, is Dunbar, a royal Burgh, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are cal∣led in Scotland, which is (much what) we call a Corporation in England, and which sent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as our Corporations in England <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in Scotland, as is generally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> stood, they had some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> separate to themselves; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Ex∣ample, of holding a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Burghs by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Me∣thod taken from the Union <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hans-Towns in the North, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> un∣like it, in which they mee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Measures for the publick Good of the Town, and of their Trade, and make By∣laws, or Acts, and Declarations, which bind the whole Body.</P>
<P>Nor have they lost this Privilege by the Union with England; but it is preserved entire, and, perhaps, is now many Ways more advantagious to them than it was before, as their Trade is like to be, in Time, more considerable than before</P>
<P>This Town of Dunbar is a handsome well-built Town, upon the Sea-shore; where they have a kind of a natural Har∣bour, tho' in the Middle of dangerous Rocks.</P>
<P>They have here a great Herring Fishery. and particularly they hang Herrings here, as they do at Yarmouth in Norfolk, for the smoking them; or, to speak the ordi∣nary Dialect, they make red Herrings here: I cannot say they are cur'd so well as at Yarmouth; that is to say, not for keeping and sending on long Voyages, as to Venice and Leghorn, though, with a quick Passage, they might hold it thither too: However, they do it very well. The Herrings also themselves may a little make the Difference, because they are generally larger and fatter than those at Ya<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mouth, which makes it more difficult to cure them, so as to keep in a hot Country, and on a long Voyage.</P>
<P>Between the Town and the great Road stands a little, but pleasant and agreeable Seat of the Duke of Roxburgh, with a Park well planted: And as the Gentle∣men of Scotland are now set upon plant∣ing Forest Trees, as well for Ornament as Profit. This Park is, among the rest, very handsomely planted with young Trees in Vista's and Walks, and will, when grown, add both to the Value and Beauty of the Seat▪ which otherwise is but as a Box. And here I would give an useful Hint to the Gentlemen who plant Trees in Scotland, the Want of which I have observed at several great Honses and Parks in that Country, is the Reason why they do not thrive, as they might other∣wise do: The Case is this.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen, at a great Expence, get Quantities of Forest Trees, either of their own raising, or from the Nursery∣men; as they call them in England. Those are set at a good Length, perhaps, 12 to 15 Foot high, handsome Bodies, and good Heads; and I acknowledge they are the best siz'd Trees to plant, and that when set younger they seldom stand it or come to the like Perfection: But then these Trees should be all secured by a triangular Frame to each Tree; that is to say, three large Stakes set about them in an equil∣ateral Triangle, and sastened all together by three short cross Pieces at the Top; and these Stakes should stand from 7 to 8 Foot high.</P>
<P>In the Center of the Triangle stands the planted Tree; which Way soever the Wind blows, the Body bends from it to the cross Piece, which joins the Stakes on that side, and which make the Trian∣gle, and then can bend no farther; by which Means the Root is not shaken, or the Earth mov'd and loosen'd about it, and then the Tree will strike Root, and grow.</P>
<P>But for Want of this, the Tree being left without Support, before, as we may say, it can stand alone; and the Winds, especially, in Winter, being very strong in that Country, the Tree is bended every
<PB REF="450"/>
Way; the Earth loosen'd continnally a∣bout it, the Root is often stirr'd, and the Tree gets on Time to strike Root into the Earth. And this is the Reason why, in many of the Gentlemens Parks, I saw the Trees stented and bauk'd; and that, tho' they had been planted many Years, they could not thrive: If this Caution may be of Use, as I recommend it with a Desire it may, the Gentleman will not think their Time l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in the reading it.</P>
<P>On the South West Side of this Town, under the Mountains near a l la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e call'd Dun Hil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ is the fatal Field where the Bat∣tel, call'd the Battle of Dunbar, was fought, between Oliver Cromwell and General Lesly, who then commanded the Royal Army; where the desperate Few, for Cromwells Army, was not a∣bove 8<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 Men deseated and totally overthrew the great Army of the other Side, kill'd 6000, and took 10,000 Priso∣ners, to the Surprize of the World; but that is Matter of History, and none of my Business at present.</P>
<P>Here we turn'd out of the Way to see the Marquess of Tweedel's fine Park, and which is, indeed, the main Thing, his fine planting at Yester, or, as Antigui∣ty calls it, Zestor; I say the Park, be∣cause, tho' there is the Design of a noble House or Pal ce, and great Part of it built; yet, as it is not yet, and perhaps, will not soon be finished, there is no giving a compleat Description of it.</P>
<P>The old Earl of Tweedale, who was a great Favourite of King Charles II. tho' uot much concern'd in politic af∣fairs, at least, not in England, yet took in from the King the Love of managing what we call Forest Trees, and making sine Vista's and Avenues: The very first Year after the Restoration the King laid out, with his own Hand, the planting of Greenwich and St. James's Parks, and several others, and the said Earl had seen them and was extremely delighted with the Method.</P>
<P>This occasioned his Lordship, as soon as he went down into Scotland, to lay out the Plan and Design of all those no∣ble Walks and Woods of Trees, or, as it might be call'd, Forests of Trees, which he afterwards saw planted, and of which a Gentleman, whose Judgment I cannot doubt, told me, that if ever those Trees came to be worth but six Pence a Tree, they would be of more Value than the Fee Simple of that Estate; not mean ng by that Estate the Land they grew o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but the whole paternal Estate of the Fa∣mily: Nor is it unlikely, if it be true, that his Lordship, and his immediate Suc∣cessor, planted above 6000 Acres of La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all full of Firr-Trees; and that, wherever it found that any Tree fail'd, they were constantly renew'd the next Year.</P>
<P>It is certain, that many of the Trees are, by this Time, of much more Value than six Pence a Tree is but a slow Grow∣er, and that most, if not all the Tree I sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ak of, are Firr; yet it must be al∣llow'd, that, the Trees thriving very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they must, by this Time, be very valu∣able; and if they stand another Age, and we do not find the Family <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Money enough to make them for∣ward to cut any of them down, there may be a noble Estate in Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Timber<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough, if it falls into good Hands, to enrich the Family.</P>
<P>The Park itself is said to be eight Miles about, but the Plantation of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not simply consin'd to the Park, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in∣deed, to this Estate; for the Family <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tweedale has another Seat near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Pinkey, where the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> planted also a great Number of Tree as his Successors have likewise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> another Seat, which they have in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> near Aberdour.</P>
<P>The House, however, must not b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forgot; and if it shall be finished, as they now tell us it will soon be, it will not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> itself to be forgot, for there will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> finer Palaces in Scotland; I mean <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> finish'd according to the Magnificence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first Design.</P>
<P>As the Success of this Planting is great Encouragement to the Nobility Scotland to improve their Estates by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same Method, so we find abundance
<PB REF="451"/>
Gentlemen of Estates do fall into it, and follow the Example: And you hard∣ly see a Gentleman's House, as you pass the Louthains, towards Edinburgh, but they are distinguish'd by Groves and Walks of Firr-Trees about them; which, tho' in most Places they are but young, yet they shew us, that in a few Years, Scot∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and will not need to send to Norway <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Timber and Deal, but will have suf∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icient of her own, and perhaps, be able <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o furnish England too with considerable Quantities.</P>
<P>We saw an Example of this at the Earl <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Haddington's House at Tinningham; where, tho' the Trees are younger than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Yester, yet, they seem to follow them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pace, and to thrive so much, as that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey may▪ one Time or other, overtake <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem. The like we saw in Fife, at Sir William Bruce's, and at several other Pla∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in this Part of the Country.</P>
<P>From this Town of Dunbar to Edin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgh, the Country may be reckoned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot only as frutiful and rich in Soil, but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so as pleasant and agreeable a Country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any in Scotland, and, indeed, as most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England, the Sea on the right Hand at moderate Distance, and the Hills on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e left, at a farther Distance; and even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose Hills not extremely high not ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, not desolate Mountains, as I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave given an Account of some farther <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outh, and I have more to speak of far∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her North. But these Hills are passable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd habitable, and have large Flocks of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heep in many Places, feeding on them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd many open Roads lie over them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s from Edinburgh, and other Parts to∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ards England, as particularly to Yester, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to Duns and Coldstream on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weed; another Way to Kelsoe, where <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so there is a Ford and a Ferry over the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weed, and likewise by another Way to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iviotdale, to Peebles and Jedburgh, of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich hereafter▪</P>
<P>The greatest Thing this Country wants <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more enclos'd Pastures, by which the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atmers would keep Stocks of Cattle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell fodder'd in the Winter, and, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gain, would not only furnish good store of Butter, Cheese, and Beef to the Mar∣ket, but would, by their Quantity of Dung, enrich their Soil, according to the un∣answerable Maxim in Grazing, that Stock upon Land improves Land.</P>
<P>Two other Articles would encrease and enrich them, but which they never practise▪</P>
<P N="1">1. Folding their Sheep.</P>
<P N="2">2. Fallowing their plow'd Land.</P>
<P>The first would fatten the Land, and the latter destroy the Weeds: But this is go∣ing out of my Way. They have, indeed, near the Sea, an Equivalent which assists them exceedingly, namely, the Sea Weed, they call it the Sea Ware, which the Sea casts up from about November to January in great Quantities, and which extremely fattens and enriches the Lands, so that they are plow'd from Age to Age without laying fallow: But farther from the Sea, and where they cannot fetch it, there they are forced to lay the Lands down to rest; when, as we say in England, they have plow'd them out of Heart, and so they get no Advantage by them; whereas could they▪ by a Stock of Cattle, raise a Stock, of Muck, or by folding. Sheep upon them, mend them that Way, and lay them down one Year in three or four, as we do in England, the Lands would hold from one Genera∣tion to another.</P>
<P>But at present, for want of Enclosures, they have no Winter Provision for black Cattle; and, for want of that Winter-Provision, the Farmers have no Daries, no Butter or Cheese; that is to say, no Quantity, and no Heaps of Dung in their Yards to return upon the Land for its Im∣provement: And thus a good Soil is im∣poverished for want of Husbandry.</P>
<P>I deliver this once for all; for I shall make all my farther Observations of this Kind very short, and only proper to the particular Places where I shall mention them.</P>
<P>From Dunbar we pass another River Tyne, which, to distinguish it from the two Tynes in Northumberland, I call Scots Tyne, tho' not forgetting to let you know it is not so distinguished there, the Inhabi∣tants thereabouts scarce knowing any other.
<PB REF="452"/>
It rises in the Hills near Yester, and watering Part of the fine and pleasant Vale I mentioned before, runs by Had∣dington, an old half ruin'd, yet remain∣ing Town; which shews the Marks of decayed Beauty, for it was formerly a large, handsome, and well built Town, or City rather, and esteemed very strong; for, besides the Walls of Stone, which were in those Times esteemed strong, the English fortifyed it with Lines and Bas∣tions, four of which Bastions were very large, as may be seen, by the Remains of them, to this Day; also they had a large Ditch; as for Counterscarps, they were scarce known in those Times. How∣ever, it was so strong, that the English, commanded by an old Soldier, Sir George Wilford, defended it obstinately against a great Army of French and Scots, till his Garrison were almost all swept away by the Plague; and, even then, held out till he was relieved from England, when the English Army quitted the Place, and de∣molished the Fortifications.</P>
<P>However, Haddington is still a good Town, has some handsome Streets, and well built; and they have a good Stone Bridge over the Tyne, tho' the River is but small The Church was large, but has suffered in the Ruin of the rest, and is but in Part repaired, tho' 'tis still large enough for the Number of Inhabitants; for, tho' the Town is still what may be call'd populous, 'tis easy to see that it is not like what it has been. There are some Monuments of the Martlands, anti∣ent Lords of this Part of the Country remaining, but as the Choir of the Church is open and defaced, the Monuments of the Dead have suffered with the rest.</P>
<P>I saw here something of a Manufacture, and a Face of Industry; and it was the first that I had seen the least Appearance of in Scotland, particularly here, was a Woollen Manufacture, erected by a Com∣pany, or Corporation, for making Broad Cloths, such as they called English Cloth. And as they had English Workmen em∣ployed, and, which was more than all, English Wooll, they reall made very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cloth, well mixed, and good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But I cannot say they made it as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or could bring it so cheap to Market <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the English; and this was the Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that, tho' before the late Union, the Eng∣lish Cloth being prohibited upon sever Penalties, their own Cloth supplied the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very well; yet, as soon as the Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was made, and by that Means the Eng∣lish Trade opened, the Clothiers not Worcester, and the Counties adjoining such as Gloucester and Wilts, brought their Goods, and underselling the Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Manufactories were not able: hold it.</P>
<P>However, as I said, here was a Woo¦len Manufacture, and the People <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> employed in Spinning, Dying▪ Weaving &amp;c. they turned their Hands to othe Things; and there is still some Busine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> going on to the Advantage of the Poor Also upon the Tyne, near Haddington we saw very good Fulling Mills; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ther they still have Employment, I a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not certain.

<P>But I must enter a Caution for your Notice, and please to take it here once for all. I am writing a Description of Places, not of Persons, giving the pre∣sent State of Things, not their History: And therefore, though in some Cases I may step back into History, yet, it shall be very seldom, and on extraordinary Occasions. For Scotland is not so barren of things worth Observation, that wes should run into History, and the Genealogie
<PB REF="454"/>
of Families, the Description of the Consti∣tution, the Laws, and Manner of Admi∣nistration of Civil Justice, Government, and such Things as are remote from the profess'd Business of a Tour. I shall not, therefore, with every Nobleman's House, give a History of the Family: The No∣bility of Scotland are ancient, illustrious, and personally great, and, if spoken of at all, require, and ought to have a full and authentick Description of their Fa∣milies and glorious Ancestors performed by itself; and, I must confess, 'tis great Pity such a Thing is not undertaken by some Hands equal to so great a Work, both here and in England also; for want of which, many, if not most of the great Actions of the Nobility and Gentry of these Kingdoms, are either quite lost and dropt out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Knowledge, or are dwindled into Fable and Romance, and, like the Battle of Chevy-Chase, preserved only in Ballad and Song.</P>
<P>But I am not to go about this here, tho' I shall, on all Occasions, give the noble Families a due Homage, and speak of them as they ought to be spoken of; yet, as it is not the Business of this Un∣dertaking, you will not expect me to en∣ter into the History of Families, or to look any farther into Persons than into Things, namely to give an Account of their present Situation and Condition.</P>
<P>In order to this 'tis sufficient to mark, that this Part of the Country is delight∣fully spread with the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen; as the Duke of Rox∣burgh's at Dunbar, the Earl of Hadding∣ton's at Tinningham, both mentioned be∣fore; the Lord Bellhaven's at Bellhaven; that of the Family of Dalrymple ennobl'd in the Earl of Stairs, and honoured in several Branches of that House, the eldest being now Lord President of their Ses∣sion, and another lately Lord Advocate, &amp;c. These about North Berwick, where there is a small and a tolorable good Market: They have also in the Neigh∣bourhood of this Place several very fine Seats, and finely planted. The House and Estate of Dirleton, now in the Fa∣mily of Nisbet, is in this Part of the Country, and well situated also. O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣stoun, the Seat of the present Lord Justice Clerk, of the ancient House of Cock<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urn, or, as commonly express'd, Coburn.</P>
<P>And I must add here, the ancient and noble Houses of Seaton and Winton: Both the Palaces, for so they deserve to be call'd, of the late Earl of Winton, who did so many weak and rash Things, to say no worse of him, in the Affair of the late Rebellion; and the kindest Thing can be said of him now is, to leave it upon Record, that he seem'd to be turn'd in his Head. The Houses are now in a State of Ruin, and as fine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Estate, for its Value as any in Scotland, all lying contiguous with itself, and va∣lued at almost 5000 <HI>l.</HI> Srerling, <HI>per Ann.</HI> besides; but all now under Forfeiture, and sold to the York Buildings Compa∣ny. The fine Gates and Stone Wall were demolished by the Government, after it had been made a Garrison by the High∣landers; who, from hence began their hair-brain'd March to England, which Expediously ended at Preston, as has been mentioned in my Account of Lan∣cashire. But I return to the Sea Shore as above.</P>
<P>The Towns upon this Coast, as I said stand very thick, and here are two or three Articles of Trade which render them more Populous, and more considerable than they would otherwise be.</P>
<P N="1">1. There are great Quantities of white Fish taken and cured upon this Coast, even within, as well as a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Mouth of the Firth; and, as I had Occasion to inspect this Part, I took Notice the Fish was very well cur'd merchantable, and fit for Expertation and there was a large Ship at the Time come from London, on Pur¦pose to take in a Loading of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Fish for B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lboa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Spain.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is great Plenty of Coal i the Hills, and so near the Sea <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="455"/>
to make the Carriage not difficult; and much of that Coal is carried to Edinburgh, and other Towns about, for Sale.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Coal being thus at Hand, they make very good Salt at almost all the Towns upon the Shore of the Firth; as at Season, Cockenny, Preston, and several others, too many to name: They have a very great Trade for this Salt to Norway, Hamburgh, Bre∣men, and the Baltick: And the Num∣ber of Ships loaded here yearly with Salt is very considerable; nay, the Dutch and Bremers in particular, come hither on purpose to load Salt, as they do on the opposite side of the Firth also, (viz.) the Shore of Fife, of which I shall speak in its Place.</P>
<P N="4">4 They take great Quantities of Oy∣sters upon this Shore also, with which they not only supply the City of Edinburgh, but they carry abundance of them in large, open Boats, call'd Cobles, as far as Newcastle upon Tyne, from whence they generally bring back Glass Bottles. But there has, within a few Years, a Bottle-house been set up at Leith, which, for a while, work'd with Success; also some Furnaces were erected at Pre∣ston-Pans, one of those Villages, for making Flint-Glass, and other Glass Water: But I hear they are disconti∣nued for want of skilful Hands.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted, that at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those Villages there are little Moles <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Harbours, or Peers, and Heads built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at considerable Expence, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Ships that come to them to load <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or other Goods; as at Season, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at North Berwick, at Preston, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Places.</P>
<P>We come now to Musclebro, a large <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ough Town and populous, and may, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed, be said to be a Cluster of Towns, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> built together into one, namely, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sclebro, or Innerask, or inneresk, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fisheraw; all which amount to more than this. Musclebro, or the main or chief Town of Musclebro; In∣neresk, or that Part of Musclebro which stands within, or on the inner Side of the River Esk, and Fisheraw, or the Row of Houses where the Fishermen usually dwell; for here is still many Fishermen, and was formerly many, when the Mus∣cle Fishing was counted a valuable Thing; but now 'tis given over, tho' the Muscles lie on the Shore, and on the Shoals of Sand in the Mouth of this River, in vast Quantities.</P>
<P>These three Towns together make one large Borough, very populous; for here are thought to be more People than at Haddington. Here also we saw the Peo∣ple busy on the Woollen Manufacture; and as the Goods they made here were an ordinary Kind of Stuff for poor Peo∣ples wearing, we do not find they are our done at all from England, so that the Manufacture is carried on here still with Success.</P>
<P>They call this a Sea Port Town; but as their River tho' sometimes still enough of Water, is not Navigable; for, at low Water, People ride over the Mouth of it upon the Sands, and even walk over it; so they do not meddle much with Trading by Sea.</P>
<P>At that Part of the Town called In∣ner-Esk are some handsome Country Hou∣ses with Gardens, and the Citizens of Edinburgh come out in the Summer and take Lodgings here for the Air, as they do from London at Kensington Graved-Pits, or at Hampstead and Highgate</P>
<P>Adjoining to this Part is the other fine Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Marquess of Tweedale, called Pinkey, which I mentioned before, and which the Family resides at, rather than at Yester; for tho' Yester be the noblest and most magnificent Building; yet this is, by far, the most agreeable Situation, besides, the former is not finished, nor like to be finished in many Years, tho' they were to go faster on with it than they do.</P>
<P>The House of Pinkey has a Park, which they call four Miles about, but, I think, is
<PB REF="456"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB REF="457"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB REF="458"/>
not much above half so much: But the Spi∣rit of Planting, which the old Earl of Twee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le so happily exerted at Yester, shew'd itself here also, and an innumberable Mum∣ber of Fir Trees, are seen here in a very thriving Condition, and promising, in Time, to be of an inestimable Value.</P>
<P>As the House at Yester is not finish'd, all the rich Furniture, and especially Pictures, of which the same Earl was a great Col∣lector, are lodg'd here; though, 'tis not doubled, they will hereafter be transpos'd and remov'd to adorn the chief Palace and Mansion of the Family. Here are, indeed, a great many valuable Pieces of Painting▪ but the Family Pieces are par∣ticular, and very remarkable, some for their Antiquity, and the antient Dress of the Age they were wrought in, and others, for the Fineness of the Workmanship; as especially that of the old Marquess of Tweedale, and his fifteen Children, done after the Manner of that of King Charles I and his Royal Family, which formerly stood at the upper End of the long Gal∣lery, at Whitehall. So this stands at the upper End of a large Room, fill d up with other Family Pieces, and takes up one whole Square of the Room.</P>
<P>I cannot dwell upon the rest of the fine Paintings here, it must suffice to add, here are a great many, and very good. Here are also three very fine Altar Pieces, with others of that Kind, suppos'd to belong to private Oratories in Popish Times, with Passion Pieces, and others of that Kind also.</P>
<P>From hence we have but four Miles to Edinburgh. But, before I go thither, I must dip so far into Story, as to observe that here it was the famous Battle of Mus∣clebro was fought between the English, under the Duke of Somerset, in the Time of King Edward VI. of England, and the Scots Royal Army under the Regent, which was afterwards call'd, the English Way of Wooing: the Quarrel was to ob∣tain the young Queen of Scots for a Wife to King Edward, which the Scots Popish Party<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> back'd by the French, were obsti∣nately against; and that so much, that tho' the English won the Battle▪ yet they lost the Prize, for the young Q een was privately embarqu'd, carry'd away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> France, and there marry'd to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>I say this Battle was sought here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we call it the Battle of Musclebro: And some Scots Gentlemen, who r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with us afterwards to shew us the Place, particularly mark'd out every Step to us where the Action was both begun a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ended, as well the Fight as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and we agreed that the Scots are in the right, who call it the Battle of Pinkie not of Musclebro. 'Tis none of my Busi∣ness to give an Account of Battles and Sieges; besides, the English being Victors, I shall not mingle any of our Trophies and Triumphs with my Account of Scot∣land, that would not be using the Scots fairly, I shall speak freely of those where they were Victors, but not throw the English, as it were in their Faces; that would be to act the very Part which I blame the Scots Writers for, namely to be always crying up my own Country and my own People. Certain it is, the Scots great Error at this Battle, as it was afterwards at the Battle of Dunbar▪ was want of Unanimity among themselves▪ for we must always blush when we pre∣tend to say the Scots ever wanted Courage in the Field, let the Cause, or the T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me or the Government be what, when, and how they will.</P>
<P>Another Mistake of the Scots▪ at th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Fight, was that they ventur'd to engage so near the Sea, as to be within Reach of the Cannon from the English Men of War, in the Road of Musclebro, who▪ very much to their Damage, flank'd her Army, and kept firing on the let <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all the while of the Battle, till the Troops were so mingled with one another, that they could not, from the Ship, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Enemies from their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> This was a great Disadvantage to their whole Army, and especially discouraged and disorder'd their Infantry, and was ow∣ing to the Inadvertency of the general
<PB REF="459"/>
Officers, not want of Courage or Bravery in their Men; and it would have been the same to the English had the Case been theirs.</P>
<P>I am now at the Gates of Edinburgh; but before I come to describe the Parti∣culars of that City, give me leave to take it in Perspective, and speak something of it's Situation, which will be very neces∣sary with respect to some Disadvantage which the City lyes under on that Ac∣count.</P>
<P>When you stand at a small Distance, and take a View of it from the East, you have, really but a confus'd Idea of the City, because the Situation being in length from East to West; and the breadth but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll proportion'd to its length, you view under the greatest Disadvantage possible; whereas if you turn a little to the right Hand towards Leith, and so come towards the City, from the North you see a very handsome Prospect of the whole City, and from the South you have yet a bet∣ter View of one Part, because the City is encreased on that Side with new Streets, which, on the North Side, cannot be.</P>
<P>The particular Situation then of the whole is thus. At the Extremity of the East End of the City stands the Palace or Court, call'd Haly Rood House; and you must fetch a little Sweep to the right Hand to leave the Palace on the left, and come at the Entrance, which is call'd the Water Port, and which you come at thro' a short Suburb: then bearing to the left again, South, you come to the Gate of the Palace which faces the great Street.</P>
<P>From the Palace, West, the Street goes on in almost a straight Line, and for near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mile and a half in length, some say full two measur'd Miles, thro' the whole City to the Castle, including the going up the Castle in the Inside; this i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, perhaps, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>argest, longest, and finest Street for Build∣ings and Number of Inhabitants, not in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ritain only, but in the World.</P>
<P>From the very Palace Door, which lands on a Flat, and level with the low∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st of the plain Country, the Street be∣gins to ascend; and tho' it ascends very gradually at first, and is no where steep, yet 'tis easy to understand that continuing the Ascent for so long a Way, the further Part, must necessarily be very high; and so it is; for the Castle which stands at the Extremity West, as the Palace do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s East, makes on all the three Sides, that only excepted, which joins it to the City, a frightful and impassable Precipice</P>
<P>Together with this continued Ascent, which, I think, 'tis easy to from an Idea of in the Mind, you are to suppose the Edge or Top of the Ascent so narrow, that the Street, and the Row of Houses on each S de of it, take up the whole breadth; so that which Way soever you turn, either to the Right or to the Left, you go down Hill immediately, and that so steep, as is very troublesome to those who walk in those Side Lanes which they call Wynds, especially if their Lungs are not very good: So that, in a Word, the City stands upon the narrow Ridge of a long ascending Mountain.</P>
<P>On the Right Side, or North Side of the City, and from the very West End of it, where the Castle stands, is a Lough, or Lake of Standing Water; there is, indeed, a small Brook runs thro' i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o that it can∣not be said to be quite Standing Water▪ And we were told, that in former Days there was another Lough on the South Side of it, which, being now fill'd up, is built into a Street, tho' so much lower than the High Street, or Ridge, that, as I said before, the Lanes or Wynds be∣tween them are very steep.</P>
<P>It is easy to conclude that such a Situ∣ation as this could never be pick'd out for a City or Town, upon any other Consi∣deration than that of Strength to defend themselves from the suddam Surprizes and Assaults of Enemies: And, tho' the Building is so antient, that no History has recorded the Foundation, either when, or by who, or on what Occasion it was built▪ yet, I say, it seems most natural to conclude, that it was built for a Retreat from the Outrages and Attempts of the
<PB REF="460"/>
Picts or Irish, or whatever other Enemies they had to fear.</P>
<P>On the Top of the Ridge of a Hill, an impregnable Castle and Precipice at one End, a Lough, or Lake of Water on either Side; so that the Inhabitants had nothing to defend but the Butrance at the East End, which it was to for∣tify.</P>
<P>If this was not the Reason, what should have hindered them from building the City in a pleasant, delightful Valley, with the Sea flowing up to one Side, and a Fresh Water River running thro' the Middle of it; such as is all that Space of Ground between the City, as it now stands, whereof the Town of Leith now stands.</P>
<P>Here they had had a noble, a plea∣sant, and a most useful Situation, a very fine Harbour for their Trade, a good Road in the Firth for their Ships of Burthen, a pleasant River, which, with small Art or Charge, might have been so drawn round the City as to have fill'd its Ditches, and made its Fortifications as impregna∣ble as the two Loughs did the City, and as the French, when they fortify'd Leith, found easy to do. Or had they gone to the South Side of the City, be∣yond the deep Lough, which, they say it was, and which is now call'd the Cow-Gate, and extended the City towards Li∣berto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and towards Good Trees, where now stands the delightful Seat of Sir James Stuart, late Lord Advocate of Scotland, and the ancient Seat of Craig∣miller, the Seat of Sir Alexander—of Craigmiller. Here had been a Plain large enough to have contain'd a second London, and water'd on the South Part with a pleasant Brook, sufficient, by the Help of Pipes, to have carried Water in∣to every Street, and every House.</P>
<P>These Things they did not foresee, or understand in those Days; but, regard∣ing immediate Safety, fixed on the Place as above as a sure Strength, form'd by Nature, and ready at their Hand. By this Means the City suffers infinite Dis∣advantages, and lies under such scanda¦lous Inconveniencies as are, by its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made a Subject of Scorn and Re∣proach; as if the People were not a willing to live sweet and clean as othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nations, but delighted in Stench an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nastiness; whereas, were any other Peo∣ple to live under the same Unhappiness▪ I mean as well of a rocky and m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ua∣tainous Situation, throng'd Buildings, from seven to ten or twelve Story high, a scarcity of Water, and that little they have difficult to be had, and to the up∣permost Lodgings, far to fetch; we should find a London or a Bristol as dirty as Edinburgh, and, perhaps, less able to make their Dwelling tolerable, at least in so narrow a Compass; for, tho' many Ci∣ties have more People in them. Yet, I believe, this may be said with Truth, that in no City in the World so many Peo∣ple live in so little Room as at Edin∣burgh.</P>
<P>On the North Side of the City, as is said above, is a spacious, rich, and plea∣sant Plain, extending from the Lough, which as above joins the City, to the River of Leith, at the Mouth of which is the Town of Leith, at the Distance of a long Scots Mile from the City: And even here, were not the North Side of the Hill, which the City stands on▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o exceeding steep, as hardly, (at least to the Westward of their Flesh-Market) to be clambered up on Foot, much less to be made passable for Carriages. But, I say, were it not so sleep, and were the Lough filled up, as it might eas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y be, the City might have been extended up∣on the Plain below, and fine beautiful Streets would, no doubt, have been built there; nay, I question much whether, in Time, the high Streets would not have been forsaken, and the City, as we might say, run all out of its Gates to the North.</P>
<P>This might have been expected, if the City had been in a State of Encrease, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Trade having flourished, as was rea∣sonably expected upon the Union, the
<PB REF="461"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nhabitants had likewise encreas'd; where∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, there being Reason to doubt that this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not the Case, but rather the contrary, we cannot talk of this as a Prospect in Hope.</P>
<P>Having thus considered the City in its Appearance, and in its present situa∣tion, I must look next into its Inside, where we shall find it under all its Dis∣couragements and Disadvantages, (and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abouring with whatever Inconveniencies) a large, populous, noble, rich, and even still a Royal City, The main street, as above, is the most spacious, the longest, and best inhabited street in Europe; its Length I have describ'd; the Buildings all surprizing both for Strength▪ for Beau∣ty, and for Height; all, or the greatest Part of Free stone, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o firm is every Thing made, that tho' in so high a situa∣tion▪ and in a Country where Storms and Winds are so frequent, 'tis very rare that any Damage is done here. No blow∣ing of Tiles about the Streets, to knock People on the Head as they pass; no Stacks of Chimneys and Gable Ends of Houses falling in to bury the inhabitants in their Ruins, as we often find it in London, and other of our Paper built Cities in England; but all is fixed, and strong to the Top, tho' you have, in that Part of the City called the Parlia∣ment Close, Houses, which, on the South side, appear to be eleven or twelve Story high, and inhabited to the very Top,</P>
<P>From the Palace Gate, Westward, this street is called the Cannon-gate, vulgarly the Cannigate, which Part, tho' a Suburb, is a kind of Corporation by itself, as West∣minster to London; and has a Toll Booth, a Prison, and a Town▪Guard by itself, tho' under the Government of the Provost and Baili<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of Edinburgh, as Leith itself also is. In this Part of the street, tho' otherwise not so well inhabited as the City itself, are several very magnificent Houses of the Nobility, built for their Residence when the Court was in Town, and on their other Occasions, just as was the Case in the Strand between London and White Hall, before the Encrease of the City prompted the building those fine Houses into Streets.</P>
<P>Of those the Duke of Queensberry's, the Earl of Wintoun's, the Duke of Rox∣burgh's, and the Earl of Murray's are the Chief; the first and last are very magnificent, large and princely Buildings, all of Free stone, large in Front, and with good Gardens behind them, and the other are very fine Buildings, too many to be described.</P>
<P>At the upper, or West End of this street, and where it joins to the City, is a Gate which, just as Ludgate, or Temple-Bar, stands parting the City itself from the Suburb, but not all discontinuing the street, which rather widens, and is more spa∣cious when you are thro' the Gate than before. This Gate, or Bow, is called the Nether Bow, or, by some, the Nether-Bow Port.</P>
<P>Just at this Port, on the Outside, turn away two streets, one goes south to a Gate or Port which lead out of the City into the great Road for England, by the Way of Kelso, and is called St Mary Wynde; and, on the Right Hard of it, another Port turns away West, int the low street, mentioned before, where was a Lough formerly filled up, and is called the Cow-Gate, because, by this street, the Cattle are driven to and from the great Market-place, called the Grass Mar∣ket, where such Cattle are bought and sold, as also where is a Horse Market weekly, as in Smithfield. This Street, called the Cow▪Gate, runs parallel with high street, but down in a Bottom, as has been said. But to go back to the Nether Bow Port, as this Turning is on the Lef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hand going into the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, so on the Right Hand goes another street, which they call Leith Wind, and leads down to a Gate which is not in the City Wall immediately, but adjoining to a Church called the College-Kirk, and thro' which Gate, a Suburb runs North opening into the Plain, leads to Leith; and along by the Road side, the Road pav'd with stones like a street, is a broad Causeway, or as we call it, a Foot Way, very firm, and made by
<PB REF="462"/>
Hand at least 20 Foot broad, and con∣tinued to the Town of Leith. This Cause∣way is very well kept at the publick Ex∣pence, and no Horses suffered to come upon it.</P>
<P>At the turning down of this Street, without the Nether-Bow Port, which they call the Head of the Canon-gate, there stood a very great Pile of Building which went both Ways, Part made the East Side of the Turning called Leith Wynd, and Part made the North Side of the Can∣non-gate; the whole was built, as many such are, for private Dwellings, but were stately▪ high, and very handsome Build∣ings▪ seven or eight Stories: But great Part of this fine Pile of Building was very unhappily burnt a few Years ago, whe∣ther they are yet fully rebuilt, I cannot say.</P>
<P>We now enter the City, properly so cal∣led; in almost the first Buildings of Note on the North Side of the Street, the Mar∣quess of Tweedale has a good City House, with a Plantation of Lime-trees behind it, instead of a Garden, the Place not allow∣ing Room for a large Garden; adjoining to which are very good Buildings, tho' in the narrow Wynds and Alleys, such as if set out in handsome Streets, would have adorn d a very noble City, but are here crouded together, as may be said, without Notice</P>
<P>Here the Physicians have a Hall, and adjoining to it a very good Garden; but I saw no Simples in it of Value, there be∣ing a Physick Garden at the Palace which furnishes them sufficiently; But they have a fine Musaeum, or Chamber of Rarities, which are worth seeing, and which, in some Things, is not to be match'd in Europe. Dr. Belford, afterwards knight∣ed, Began the Coll<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction. Sir Sobert S b∣bald has printed a Catalogue of what was then deposited in his Time. The Physi∣cians of Edinburgh have preserved the Character of Able, Learned, and Experi∣enced, and have not been outdone by any of their Neighbours: And the late Dr. Pitcairn, who was the Ratcliff ef Scot∣land, has left large Testimonies of his Skill in Nature and Medicine to the World.</P>
<P>It must not be expected I can go on to describe all the Buildings of the City: I shall therefore only touch at such Things, and go on. From the Neither Bow, you have an open view up the high Street. On the South Side is the I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Kirk, and a little farther, in the middle of the Street the Guard House, where the Town Guard does Duty every Night. These are in the Stead of our Watchmen, and the Town maintains two full Com∣panies of them, clothed and armed as Grenadiers,</P>
<P>Those are as a Guard to keep the pub∣lick Peace of the City, but I cannot but acknowledge that they are not near so good a Safe guard to the Citizens, against private Robberies, as our Watchmen in London are; and Edinburgh is not with∣out such Fellows as Shop▪Lifters, House∣robbers, and Pick pockets, in Proportion to the Number of People, as much as London itself.</P>
<P>About Midway, between the Nether Bow and the Castle Hill, is the great Church, formerly it was call'd the Cathe∣dral, and was all one Church, dedicated to St. Giles: But since the abolishing Epis∣copacy, and that the Presbyterian Church is now established by the Union, so as never legally to suffer another Change; I say never legally, because it cannot be done without dissolving the Union, which I take to be indissolvable: Since this Esta∣blishment, the Cathedral Church is div d∣ed into four Parochial Churches.</P>
<P>In one of those Churches, which they call the New Church, were Seats for the Parliament, High Commissioners, and the Nobility, when the Parliament was as∣sembled, tho' that Occasion is now over; In a Room, formerly a Kind of consistory Room, on the South Side of the Church, the General Assembly hold their Meet∣ings once a Year, as also does the Com∣mission of the Assembly in the Intervals of the General Meeting as Occasion re∣quires. In the great Tower of this Church they have a Set of Bells, which are not

<P>The great Opening into the high Street <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the only Passage into it for Coaches, at the North East Corner, between the South East Corner of the High Kirk, and the opposite high Buildings, and a little from the Opening is the Market-Oross, where all their Proclamations and publick Acts are read and publish'd by sound of Trumper. Here is the great Parade, where, every Day, the Gentlemen meet for Busi∣ness or News, as at an Exchange, the usual Time of Meeting is from Fleven to One. Here is also another Passage at the North West Corner, which goes into the Land market, and another Passage down innumerable Stone Stairs, on the South S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, leading into the Cowgate.</P>
<P>On the West End of the great Church, but in a different Building, is the Tol∣booth, or common Prison, as well for Criminals as Debtors, and a miserable Hole it is, to say no worse of it; tho', for those that can pay for it, there are some Apartments tolerable enoguh, and Persons of Quality are sometimes confin'd here.</P>
<P>The great Church and this Prison also standing in the middle of the Street, the Breadth and Beauty of it is for some Time interrupted, and the Way is contracted for so far as those Buildings reach on the North Side.</P>
<P>But those Buildings past, the S reet opens again to a Breadth rather wider than before, and this is called the Land market, but for what Reason I know not. This Part is also nobly built, and extends West to the Castle Hill, or rather to a narrower Street which leads up to the Castle.</P>
<P>At the upper End of this Land market is a Stone Building▪ appropriated to se∣veral publick Offices of lesser Value, and is called the Weigh-house; for below Stairs are Warehouses, with publick Weights and Scales for heavy Goods.</P>
<P>He e the high Str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ends, and porting into two Streets, one goes away South West, and descending gradually, leads by the West Bow, as 'tis called, to the Grass-market. This Street, which is called the Bow, is generally full of wholesale Tra∣ders, and those very considerable Dealers in I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, Pitch. Tar, Oyl, Hemp, Flax, Linseed, Painters Colours, Dyers, Drugs

and Woods, and such like heavy Goods, and supplies Country Shopkeepers, as our Wholesale Dealers in England do: And here I may say, is a visible Face of Trade, most of them have also Ware∣houses in Leith, where they lay up the heavier Goods, and bring them hither, or sell them by Patterns and Samples, as they have Occasion.</P>
<P>There are large Gates in the City which they call Ports, including those to the Cannon Gate.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Water-Gate, which is the East Gate by the Palace, leading out of the City towards Berwick, and is the great Post Road to England.</P>
<P N="2">2. The South Port, mentioned before, leading likewise into the Road to Soutra Hill, and so to England by way of Kelso.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Cowgate Port, at the East End of the Cowgate, and entring from the street leading to the south Port.</P>
<P N="4">4. The College Port, or the Gate go∣ing South by the Wall of Harriot's Hospital.</P>
<P N="5">5. The West Bow Port, spoken of be∣fore in the middle of the street, men∣tiened above where the wholesale Dealers dwell.</P>

<P>The Markets in Edinburgh are not in the open Street, except that in the high street, where there is every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an Herb and Fruit Market▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> abates before Noon, and what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> then is no Grievance, Besides <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are several di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inct Market <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in, and reserved for the particular <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they are appointed for, and very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> regulated by the Magistrates, and well rep∣plied also, as</P>

<P>But I must not omit the Seminaries of Learning, and the Attendants upon them, nor the Surgeons and Apotheca∣ries, with the great Hospital, all which stand on the south side of the City; the first of them is the Surgeons Hall, or Surgeon-Apothecaries, for here they make but one Profession. They have set up a large Building all at their own Charge, in which is their great Hall, hung round with the Pictures of all the Sur∣geons of the City, that are, or have been since the Building was erected, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Pictures of Duke Hamilton, and the late Lord Chancellor</P>
<P>They have also a Chamber of Rarities, a Theatre for Dissections, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bagnio in Britain; 'tis perfectly well con∣trived, and exactly well finished, no Ex∣pence being spared to make it both con∣venient and effectually useful.</P>
<P>In their Chamber of Rarities they have several Skeletons of strange Creatures, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mummy, and other curious Things, too many to be particular in them here.</P>
<P>The Humanity School is kept in the same Part, which is reckoned as a Par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="465"/>
of the University, as being employ'd in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Youth for the College. West of these is the College itself, they call it the University: But as it consists of but one College, I call it no more. How∣ever, here are all the usual Methods of Academick Learning in their full Perfecti∣on. The Principal, or Master, has a hand∣some D elling-house and Garden in the College. There are besides a Professor of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> four Regents, or Professors of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Professor of Greek, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Hebrew▪ another of History, of the Mathematicks, and of the Civil <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw</P>
<P>The College has a very handsome Pub¦l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Library; and, though not famous for Number of Books, is yet so for its being a valuable Collection of Antiquity, and has <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome very good Manuscripts. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Act of Parliament for settling the Right of Copies, has made Provision for a constant Supply of modern Books, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such as are printed in England; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Library is like to Encrease, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to a great one.</P>
<P>Here was formerly a Mint, but that is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow laid aside, the Union having made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne and the same Coinage common to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whole Island.</P>
<P>The Churches in this populous City are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Ten, (viz.)</P>
<P N="1">1. The Cannon Gate Church.</P>
<P N="2">2. The College Kirk.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Trone Kirk.</P>
<P N="4">4. The New Kirk.</P>

<P N="8">8. The Lady Yester's Kirk.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Gray Friars Kirk.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Well Kirk</P>
<P>There are also many Meeting-houses he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Church of England▪ though they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot all use the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommon Prayer▪ These are the Dissenters in Scotland, as the Presbyterians are Dissenters in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>There are also two Churches at Leith, and very large and very full they are, and so indeed are all the Churches in the City, for the People of Scotland do not wander about on the Sabbath Days, as in England; and even those who may have no more Religion than enough, yet Custom in short has made i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> almost natural to them, they all go to the Kirk.</P>
<P>They have also one very good Cu∣stom as to their Behaviour in the Church, which I wish were practis'd here, namely, that after the Sermon is over, and the Blessings given, they all look round up∣on their Friends, and especially to Per∣sons of Distinction, and make their Civi∣lities and Bows as we do here, for, by the Way, the Scots do not want Man∣ners.</P>
<P>I have now done with the City, the Palace only, and the Castle remain to be be mention'd; the last is strong by Situa∣tion, not much better'd by Art, and far from being impregnable, as has been proved more than once. It is now of little Use, unless for Salutes, and firing Guns upon Festivals, and in some Ca∣ses to lay up Magazine of Arms and Ammunition, and to receive Prisoners of State.</P>
<P>The Governor has very good Apart∣ments, and so has the Lieutenant Go∣vernor, as also the Fort-Major, and some other Officers, and there are deep Vaults in the Rock, which they say are Boom-Proof, and I doubt not but they are so, for they go down into them by a great Number of Steps. There is al∣so a Well of very good Water in the
<PB REF="466"/>
Castle, and it is carefully kept, but it is prodigious Depth. Here are not a great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Guns planted, neither, indeed, is here Room to place many Guns, or Use for them where they can be plac'd the Works so very high.</P>
<P>The Palace is a handsome Building, ra∣ther convenienc than large. The Entrance is Majestick, and over the Gate a large Apartment, which the Duke of Hamilton claims as House-keeper, or rather Gate∣keeper of the Palace; within this a large, irregular Court, where, I must needs say, are very improperly plac'd the Coach∣houses and Stables, which should much ra∣ther have been farther off, either in the Park▪ or without the Outgate; And, if here had been a Barrack, or Guard-house, like the Horse-Guards at Whitehall, it would have look'd much more like a Royal Palace for the King. On either Side of this Court are Gardens, Yards the Scots call them, whereof one is like our Apothecaries Garden at Chelsea, call'd a Physick Garden, and is tolerably well stor'd with Simples, and some Exoticks of Value; and, particularly I was told, there was a Rhubarb Tree, or Plant, and which throve very well. In this Garden stands Queen Mary's Dial, which is a very cu∣rious one, but neglected.</P>
<P>Antiquity claim the Fee Simple here, and tell us that the Church is still Ground Landlord; for, before the Reformation, this was a Monastery; and, tho' it was converted into a Palace before the Sup∣pression of Religious Houses, yet, that till then the Monks had a fair Apartment, and was therefore call'd Haly-rood House, and they did but entertain the Kings and Queens in the other as a Kind of Guest Mares, or, as we call them, Lodgers.</P>
<P>But, be that as it will, the Reforma∣tion found a good House upon the Pre∣misses, which serv'd the Kings for some ages before, and which King Charles II. after the Restoration, caus'd to be pul∣led down, except the two Rondels, or Towers, and built the whole Fabrick new as it now stands. It is a firm, strong Building, square in Form, having one Court only in the Center; and the lower Story being divided, the inner Part makes a very handsome Piazza, tho' the Work is plain, and very little Ornament, there∣fore not to be described as one Author does by the Pillars of the Exchange of London, which are set off with almost all the Ornament Art could invent.</P>
<P>The Apartments are all upon the first Floor, the Offices below, and some upper Rooms are allotted to the Servants of the Court when the Court is there. I have not Room to describe the particular Apartments, nor is it of Moment. The great Stair-case is at the South West Cor∣ner of the House, and the Guard-Cham∣ber and Rooms of State take up the South Side of the House, as the King's Lodg∣ings do the East Side, which the Lord Commissioner makes use of in Time of Parliament; and the West Side would be supposed to be the Queen's Lodgings, if such a Thing was to be seen again in Scotland, but at present are out o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Use. The North Side is taken up wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h one large Gallery, reaching the whole length of the House, famous for having the Pic∣tures of all the Kings of Scotland, from King Fergus, who, they say, reigned Anno ant. CHR. 320. But, in my Opi∣nion, as these Pictures cannot be, and are not supposed to the Originals, but just a Face and Dress left to the Discretion of the Limner, and so are all Guels-work, I see no Rarity, or, indeed, any Thing valuable in it. As to their later Kings there may be some Pretence to have their Pictures from old preserved Draughts, or from their Coins or Medals, and such may be, indeed, worth preserving; and, tho' they were but copyed again, it would have been worth seeing; but, as it is, I must confess it seems a trifling Thing, ra∣ther than a Gallery <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for a Court.</P>
<P>The old Chapel Royal, or Church o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Convent, stands in its Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shabile, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ined and decayed, and must fall down. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a King James IId's Time, the old Council-Chamber was consecrated for a Chapel,
<PB REF="467"/>
instead of the antient Fabrick; and there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Roman Priests officiated for some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, promising themselves not only to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore the great antient Chapel, but even seize upon the Palace itself in the Right the Church, and make a noble Monas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of it, which it must be confessed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been done with very little <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But their Reign was too short the Undertaking.</P>
<P>On the Side of the Park was a Part set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for fine Gardens, and they are still <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> St. Ann's Yards, that is Gardens; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they have never been planted or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med.</P>

<P>Here is a very fine Key well wharf'd with Stone, and fenced with Piles, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to discharge much more Business than Place can supply, tho' the Trade is from being inconsiderable too. At Mouth of the Harbour is a very long well built Pier, or Head, which runs beyond the Land a great Way, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> defends the Entrance into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from filling up with Saud, as, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gales of Wind at North East, would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery likely: There are also Ranges of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or Break waters, as the Seamen call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the other Side the Harbour, all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are kept in good Repair; and by Means the Harbour is preserved, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open in spight of a Flat Shore, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> swell of the Sea.</P>

Here the late Rebel H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh∣landers made a bold Stop, and took Pos∣session of it for one Night; but not find∣ing their Friends in the City in any Con∣dition to join them; and the Troops pre∣paring to attack them, they quitted it in the Night, and marched off to the Ear<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Winton's House, as has been said.</P>
<P>Leith, tho' it has a particular Bayli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, is yet under the Jurisd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of the Magis∣trates of Edinburgh, and is governed by them The Town had a great Disaster a few Years before the Union, by a Store∣house of Gunpowdertaking Fire, which de∣molished almost a whole Street of Houses, the Loss is not fully repaired to this Day: Many Lives also were lost, and many People miserably hurt and bruised, which, I think, should serve as a hint to all Governments, not to suffer Quantities of Powder to be kept in populous Towns.</P>
<P>This Town was once very strong, when the French held it, as they did for many Years against the Reformers, and were not at last driven out but by an Army from England, which Queen Eliza∣beth sent to assist the Protestants</P>
<P>From Leith, the Firth, which is there, at least, two Leagues over, holds that Breadth for five or six Miles, and then narrows a little beyond Cramond; and again at the Queens-Ferry it is reduced to two Miles Breadth, and an Island in the Middle also.</P>
<P>There is also a Ferry at Leith, the Boats going from Leith to Burnt-Island, or, as the Scots call it, Brantillian; but as 'tis no less than seven Miles, and that some∣times they meet with bad Weather: The Passengers are so often f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hted, that I knew several Gentlemen that would al∣ways choose to go round to the Queens Ferry, rather than venture over at Leith; this, I suppose, gave Beginning to that homely Piece of Proverb Poetry, that,

Queens Ferry is not a Passage over the Water only, but a very good Town also, and a Corporation. And here I must take Notice of a Thing which was so surprising, I mean as to the Quantity of Herrings taken, and that might be taken in those Seas. There was, at that Time, a Fleet of between seven and eight Hundred Sail of Dutch Busses come into the Firth, loaden with Herrings, and their Convoy with them, for it was in the Tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the late Wars; the Scots themselves had taken a vast Quantity, for they said they had had a very good Fishery along upon the Coast of Fife, and of Aberdeen, and the Dunbar Men, and the Firth Boats, were every Day taking more; and yet the Water of the Firth was so full of Fish, that passing at the Queens Ferry in a little Norway Yawl, or Boat, rowed by two Boys, the Boys toss'd the Fish out of the Water into the Boat with their naked Hands only: But I shall have Occasion to men∣tion this again.</P>
<P>Between Edinburgh and this Town the Marquess of Annandale has a small, but very pleasant House. And here I ob∣served his Lordship was making Bricks, in order to build Walls round his Gar∣den; a Thing hard to be seen in Scot∣land, except there. On the other Hand, it is for want of Brick Walls that the Wall Fruit in Scotland does not thrive so well there as it would otherwise do: And whereas they have no Peaches or Nectarines, or but very few, it is evi∣dent, had they Brick Walls they might have both; but the Stone will not do it. The Reflection of the Sun is not equally nourishing, nor does the Stone hold the Warmth of the Sun, after it is gone, as the Bricks do.</P>
<P>All the Country, between Edinburgh and this Place, is throng'd with Gentle∣men's Houses, also as it was observed to be on the other Side: But the Beauty of all this Part is Hopton House, built upon a delightful Plain, and yet upon the Edge, as we may say, of a high Preci∣pice; from whence you, as it were▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down upon the Ships as they Sail by for you stand above the Top Mast He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them.</P>

of the greatest Trade to Holland and France, before the Union, of any in Scot∣land, except Edinburgh; and, for Ship∣ping, it has more Ships belongs to it than to Edinburgh and Leith put toge∣ther; yet their Trade is declined of late by the Dutch Trade, being carry'd on so much by Way of England: But, as they tell us, the Glasgow Merchants are re∣solving to settle a Trade to Holland and Hamburgh in the Firth, by bringing their foreign Good, viz. their Sugars and To∣bacco by Land to Alloway, and from thence export them as they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Occa∣sion. I say, in this Case, which is very probable, the Borristoun Ness Men will come into Business again; for as they have the most Shipping, so they are the best Seamen in the Firth; and particu∣larly they are not Sailors only, but even Pilots for the Coast of Holland, they are so acquainted with it, and so with the Baltick, and the Coast of Norway also.</P>

<HEAD>JOURNEY XII.</HEAD>
<P>AS I entered the East Side of Scot∣land from Berwick upon Tweed, and have carryed on my Ac∣counts through the Louthians, which are deservedly called the best and most pleasant, as well as most fruitful Part of Scotland: And therein have al∣so given you my Observations of the Capital City and Port of the Kingdom, I mean Edinburgh and Leith: So the West Part having been travelled over by me at another particular Journey from England; and that I went from England by another Road, I shall give you my Account of it also by itself.</P>
<P>Passing the River Eden, or, (as it is ordinarily called) the Solway Firth at Carlisle, we entered upon Scotland, on the Side of Dumfries Shire, the South∣most Shire of the West of Scotland. The Division of this County into Esk∣dale, Nith<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dale, and Ann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndale, is but the ordinary marking out the Rivers Esk, Annan, and Nid▪ as I observed of the Rivers in the North of England, Tweedale, Tyndale, Swale Dal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and others; for the whole Province makes but one Dumfries Shire, and as such you will understand it as I go on.</P>
<P>Tho Esk is a tolerable large River, and gives Name to the South East Part of this County; but we saw little worth Notice but K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op, a small Market Town on a River of the same Name, which afterwards falls into Esk, and is famous for being the Place where, by a Treaty, after the Battle of Pinkey, the Limits or Borders of the two Kingdoms were set∣tled;
<PB REF="470"/>
though the Borderers observed it, no longer than served for their Purpose, robbing and plundering one another upon all Occasions, as Opportunity offered.</P>
<P>This River soon after leaves Scotland, and runs into the English Border, leav∣ing nothing behind it worth my Trouble of Remarking, or yours of Reading, only to tell you it empties itself into the Solway Firth, which indeed receives all the Rivers on this Part of the Island, as well from England as from Scotland.</P>
<P>The first Place of Note we came to in Scotland was Annand, or as some call it, Annandale, as they do the County, though, I think, improperly. It was a Town of Note, and a Sea Port, and ha∣ving a good River and Harbour, was esteemed a Town of good Trade; but it was not situated for Strength; and the English took it so often, and especially the last Time burnt it to the Ground, in that War so fatal to the Scots, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. that it never recover'd. Here was a good Salmon Fishery, and a Trade to the Isle of Man, and by that to Ireland: But as the Face of Trade is altered since that Time, and by the Ruin of the Places the Merchants, and Men of Substance, removed to Dumfries, the Town continues, to all Appearance, in a state of itrevocable Decay.</P>
<P>It was but a dull Welcome into Scot∣land to see, not only by this Town, that the Remains of the old Devastations, com∣mitted in the Time of the Hostilities be∣tween the two Nations, were so visible, so unrepair'd, and, as we might say, so likely to continue unrepair'd; whereas, tho' there are Remains also on the Eng∣lish Side, yet, not so plain, and in many Places Things much restor'd, and in a Way to be more so: But the Poverty of the common People, and the Indolence of the Gentry, will fully account for the Difference. The Bridge over the River at Annand, is very firm and good, and there is a tolerable good Market.</P>
<P>From hence, keeping the Sea as close as we could on our Left, we went on due West to Dumfries, a Sea-Port Town at the Mouth at the River Nid, or Nith, which gives Name to the third Division of the County call'd Nithsdale; but the Town is justly the Capital of the whole Shire, and indeed, of all the South West Part of Scotland.</P>
<P>Here, indeed, as in some other Ports on this Side the Island, the Benefits of Commerce, obtain'd to Scotland by the Union, appear visible; and that much more than on the East Side, where they seem to be little, if any thing mended, I mean in their Trade.</P>
<P>Dumfries was always a good Town, and full of Merchants. By Merchants, here I mean, in the Sense that Word is taken and understood in England (viz.) not Mercers and Drapers, Shop keepers, &amp;c. But Merchant Adventurers, who trade to foreign Parts, and employ a con∣siderable Number of Ships. But if this was so before, it is much more so now; and as they have (with Success) embark∣ed in Trade, as well to England as to the English Plantations, they apparently en∣crease both in Shipping and People; for as it almost every where appears, where Trade increases, People must and will in∣crease; that is, they flock to the Place by the necessary Consequences of the Trade, and, in Return, where the Peo∣ple increase, the Trade will increase, be∣cause the necessary Consumption of Pro∣visions, Cloats, Furniture, &amp;c. necessarily increases, and with them the Trade.</P>
<P>This is such a Chain of Trading Con∣sequences, that they are not to be separa∣ted; and the Town of Dumfries, as well as Liverpool, Manchester, Whitehaven, and other Towns in England are Demon∣strations of it.</P>
<P>This Town is situated also for an In∣crease of Commerce on the River Nid, for tho' it stands near two Leagues from the Sea, yet the Tide flows up to the Town, and Ships of Burthen come close up to the Key; but at about four Miles below the Town the largest Merchant-Ships in Britain might come up, and ride in Safety.</P>
<P><PB REF="471"/>
There is a very fine Stone Bridge here over the River Nid; as also a Castle, tho' of old Work, yet still good and strong enough; also an Exchange for the Mer∣chants, and a Tolbooth, or Town-Hall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Use of the Magistrates.

<P>The River Nid here parts the two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nties of Galloway and Dumfries Shire; there is a Gate in the Middle of the ge which is the Limit between them: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Neighbourhood of Galloway, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h is a great and rich Province, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Trade of Dumfries very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

<P>Drumlanrig, like Chatsworth in Dar∣by shire, is like a fine Picture in a dirty Grotto, or like an Equestrian Statue set up in a Barn; 'tis environ'd with Moun∣tains, and that of the wildest and most hideous Aspect in all the South of Scot∣land; as particularly that of Enterkin, the frightfullest Pass and most dangerous that I met with, between that and Penmen∣muir in North Wales; but of that in its Place.</P>
<P>We were not so surprized with the Height of the Mountains, and the Baren∣ness of the Country beyond them▪ as we were with the Humour of the People, who are not in this Part, by many De∣grees▪ so populous, or so polish'd, as in the other Parts of Scotland. But that which was more surprising than all the rest, was to see a Palace so glorious, Gar∣dens so fine, and every Thing so truly magnificent, and all in a wild, mountain∣ous Country, the like we had not seen before; where, in a Word we saw the Peak of Darby restored, (viz.) the finest Palace in all that Part of Britain, erected under the Mountains, full of Lead-Mines, and Quarries of Freestone, and where no∣thing, but what was desolate and dismal, could be expected, especially if you come to it by the said Pass of Enterkin, or by the Mountains of Cumock and Carrick, more to the North West of the Place. This was certainly a Foil to the Build∣ings, and sets them off with all possible Advantage; upon which the same Hand which before gave us the Lines upon the Waters of Buxton-Bath, being in the Company, bestowed the following upon Drumlanring Castle.</P>

<L>And circled Beauty in Deformity.</L>
<L>The happy Discord entertains the Sight,</L>
<L>And as these shew more black, that shews more bright.</L>
</LG>
<P>As you come to the Palace from the Road of Edinburgh, which is by the said Pass of Enterkin, you come first to the River Nid, which is just there both broad and exceeding deep, over which there is a stately Stone Bridge, built by the noble Founder of the Castle, I mean the first Duke of Queensberry, who built the House.</P>
<P>The Building is Four-square, with Roundels in the inner Angels of the Court, in every one of which is a Stair-Case, and a Kind of a Tower on the Top. This Way of Building, 'tis confess'd, does not seem so modern as the rest of the Building; but as 'tis not seen in the Front, 'tis well enough.</P>
<P>The House stands on the Top of a rising Ground, which, at its first Building, lay with a steep and uncouth Descent to the River, and which made the Lookers on wonder what the Duke meant to build in such a disproportioned Place: But he best und rstood his own Design; for the House once laid out all that unequal De∣scent, is so beautifully levell'd and layed out in Slopes and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errasses, that nothing can be better designed, or indeed, bet∣ter performed than the Gardens are, which take up the whole South and West sides of the House; and, when the whole Design will be done, the rest will more easy, the Ground being a Plain the other Way, and the Park and Avenues compleatly planted with Trees.</P>
<P>At the Extent of the Gardens there are Pavillions and Banquetting-Houses, exactly answering to one another, and the Greens trimm'd, Spaliers and Hedges are in Perfection.</P>
<P>The inside is answerable to the Out∣side, the Apartments finely placed and richly furnished: And the Gallery may well be called a Gallery of Beauties, it∣self's a Beauty. And being filled from End, to End, the whole Length of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> side of the Building, with the Fam ly. Pieces of the Duke's Ancestors, most of them at full Length, and in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of State, or of Office, as their History directed. William the first Ra ser of the Family, was only a Knight and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Drumlanrigg, who was sent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to England, to ransome King Jame<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I. at that Time detained in England.

<P>This was the Person who built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> noble Palace I am speaking of, wh every Way, merited the Honours wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Prince rather loaded him with, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bestowed on him: He lies buried in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parish Church of Disdier or Didier, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a fine Monument over him; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like that lately erected for his Son <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> late Duke.</P>

<P>That this noble Person was Lord Com∣missioner at the Time of the Union, sat in the Throne at the last Parliament of Scotland, and touched with the Scepter the Act of Parliament, which put an end to Parliaments for ever in that part of Great Britain, will always be Matter of History to the End of Time; whether the Scots will remember it to the Advan∣tage of the Duke's Character, in their Opinion, that must be as their several O∣pinions guide them.</P>
<P>This Duke's Monument, curiously done in Marble at full Length, is also placed in the same Church at Disdier, where he is buried with his Datchess, a Daugh∣ter of the House of Burlington in Eng∣land.</P>
<P>But I dwell too long here. While I was at Drumlanrig, being desired by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate Duke to make some Observations on his Grace's Estate there, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery great, in Order to some English <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mprovement, I, in particular, viewed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome of the Hills to the North of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astle, and having a Darbyshire C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an with us, who was thoroughly ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inted with those Things, we disco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered in several Places evident Tokens of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead Mines, such as in D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>byshire, and Somersetshire, are said never to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to confirm our Opinions in it, we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ok up several small Pieces of Oar in the Gulls and Holes, which the Rains had made in the sides of the Mountains, and also of a plain Sparr, such as is not found any where without the Oar: But the Duke's Death put an end to these Enqui∣ries, as also to several other Improvements then in View.</P>
<P>Here we were surprized with a Sight, which is not now so frequent in Scot∣land as it has been formerly, I mean one of their Field Meetings, where one Mr. John Hepburn, an old Cameronian, preach∣ed to an Auditory of near 7000 People, all sitting in Rows on the steep side of a green Hill, and the Preacher in a lit∣tle Pulpit made under a Tent at the Foot of the Hill; he held his Auditory, with not above an Intermission of half an Hour, almost seven Hours; and many of the poor People had come fifteen or sixteen M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les to hear him, and had all the Way to go home again on Foot. I shall say nothing to it, for my Business is not to make Remarks on such Things; only this I may add, that if there was an equal Zeal to this in our Part of the World, and for that Worship which we acknow∣led<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to be true, and of a sacred Institu∣tion, our Churches would be more throug'd on the Sabbath day than they are now. But that also by the Way.</P>
<P>From Drumlanrig I took a Turn to see the famous Pass of Ente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kin, or In∣trokin Hill: It is, indeed, not easy to describe; but by tell ng you that it ascends through a winding bottom for near half a Mile, and a Stranger sees nothing terri∣rible, but vast high Mountains on either Hand, tho' all Green, and with Sheep feeding on them to the very Top; when, on a sudden, turning short to the left, and crossing a Rill of Water in the Bottom, you mount the Side of one of those Hills, while, as you go on, the Bottom in which that Water runs down from between the Hills, keeping its Level on your Right, begins to look very deep, till at Length it is a Precipice ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rible and terrifying; on the le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Hill rises almost perpendicular; till being come about half Way, you

<P>Indeed, there were several Things this last time we pass'd it, which rendered it more frightful to a Stranger: One was, that there had been, a few Days before, a suddain Frost, with a great deal of Snow; and though, a little before the Snow, I pass'd it, and there was nothing to be seen; yet then I look'd down the fright∣ful Precipice▪ and saw no less than five Horses in several Places, lying at the Bot∣tom with their Skins off, which had, by the Slipperiness of the Snow, lost their Feet, and fallen irrecoverably to the Bot∣tom, where the Mountaines, who make light of the Place, had found Means to come at them, and get their Hides off.</P>
<P>But that which is most remarkable of this Place is yet behind (viz.) that noted Story of the Whigs in the old persecut∣ing Time, in King Charles IId's Time, and which I must give you a short Ac∣count of, for I have not Room for the whole History.</P>
<P>A Troop of Dragoons had been sent, by Order of their commanding Officer, to disturb a Field Meeting, such a one as I just now descrbed. These Meetings were strictly forbidden at that Time, and the Minister, if taken, was punished with Death, without Mercy: The poor People of this Country being all, what they then called Cameronian and Whigs, (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here, by the Way, the Word Whig be∣gan first to be known) I say, the People being zealous in their Way, would and did hold their Field Meetings, notwith∣standing all the Prohibitions the Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could make; upon which the Govern¦ment quartered the Dragoons upon them with Orders, on all such Occasions, t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disperse them, and what Prisoners the too they were to carry to Edinburg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> especially their Ministers.

<P>As the whole Country were the Friends, the Dragoons could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> immediately Notice would be taken, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Alarm given: The People at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meeting had always some slout <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> armed with Fire Arms, to prevent a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prize, and they had so now, enough have beaten off the Dragoons, if th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had attacked them, but as they did covet Fighting and Blood, otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on Necessity for their own Defence, that they had no timely Notice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, they chose to break up and perse; and they were really <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when the Dragoons came to the Plac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

<P><PB REF="475"/>
They knew the Dragoons would carry him to Edinburgh, and they knew, that to do so, they must necessarily go thro' this narrow Pass of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterken: They were but thirteen Men on Foot; but being nimble Fellows, and knowing the private Ways prefectly well, they reach'd the Top of the Hill long before the Dra∣goons; eight of them therefore plac'd themselves in the Head of the narrow Way▪ where the Dragoons were coming on one by one, or at most two by two, and ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y softly, you may believe, by the Nature of the Place.</P>
<P>The other five sliding down from the Top of the Hill, on the Left of the Pass, plac'd themselves, as they found to their Advantage, being resolved to speak with the Troop as they came by. It was a thick Mist, as is often upon those Hills, (indeed seldom otherwise) so that the Dragoons could not discover them, till they were within Hearing, nor then, so as to know how many they were.</P>
<P>When the Dragoons came up within Hearing one of the five, boldly calls to the Commander by his Name, and bid him halt with his Troop, and advance no farther at his Peril; the Captain calls out again, who are you? and what would you have? They answered, deliver our Minister; the Capta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n damn'd them a lit∣tle, and march'd on: The Cameronian called to him again with a threatning Air, Will you deliver our Minister? at which he reply'd, as loud, No, you Dog, and if you were to be damn'd; at which the Man fir'd immediately, and shot him thro' the Heart, so that he fell from his Horse, and never spoke a Word, and the frighted Horse, fluttering a little at the Fall of his Rider, fell down the Precipice, and there was an End both of Horse and Man together.</P>
<P>At that very Moment the eight Men, at the Head of the Pass, shew'st them∣selves, though at a Distance, and gave a Shout, which put the whole Body into a pannick Fear; for had they fir'd, and the Horses been put into the least Confusion, half of them would have been down the Precipice immediately. In short, the Lieu∣tenant that commanded next, being w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ser then his Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, gave them better Words and desir'd them to forbear firing for a minute or two; and after a very short Conference with his Men (for they had no more Officers to call a Council of War with) resolv'd upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in which, upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> off and leave the Pais free, they deliver'd their Minister, and they carry'd him off, and glad the Dragoons were of their De∣liverance; for, indeed, if they had been 500 instead of 50, the thirteen men might have destroyed them all; nay, the more they had been, the more certain would have been their Destruction.</P>
<P>But I must go back to Dumfries again, for this was but an Excursion from thence, as I observed there: I resolved, before I quitted the West Coast to see all that was worth seeing on that side, and the next trip we made was into Galloway: And here, I must confess, I could not but look with grief and concern upon the Country and indeed upon the people.</P>
<P>Galloway, as I hinted before, begins even from the middle of the Bridge of Dumfries; the first town on the coast, of any note, is Kirkubrigbt, or, as vul∣garly called, Kirkubry. It must be ac∣knowledged this very place is a surprize to a stranger, and especially one whose business is observation, as mine was.</P>
<P>Here is a pleasant situation, and ye nothing pleasant to be seen. Here is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> harbour without Ships, a Port withou Trade, a Fishery without Nets, a People without Business; and, that which i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worse than all, they do not seem to de∣sire Business, much less do they under¦stand it. I believe they are very goo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christians at Kirkubry, for they are in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very Letter of it, they obey the Text and are contented with such Things a they have. They have all the Material for Trade, but no Genius to it; all th opportunities for Trade, but no Inclina¦tion to it. In a Word, they have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="476"/>
Notion of being rich and populous, and thriving by Commerce. They have a fine River, navigable for the greatest Ships to the Town-Key; a Haven, deep as a Well, safe as a Mill pond; 'tis a meer wet Dock, for the little Island of Ross lyes in the very Entrance, and keeps off the West and North West Winds, and breaks the Surge of the Sea; so that when it is rough without, 'tis always smooth within. But, alas! there is not a Vessel, that deserves the Name of a Ship, belongs to it; and, though here is an extraordinary Salmon Fishing the Sal∣mon come and offer themselves, and go again, and cannot obtain the Priviledge of being made useful to Mankind; for they take very few of them. They have also white Fish, but cure none; and Her∣rings, but pickle none. In a Word, it is to me the Wonder of all the Towns of North Britain; especially, being so near England, that it has all the Invitations to Trade that Nature can give them, but they take no Notice of it. A Man might say of them▪ that they have the Indies at their Door, and will not dip into the Wealth of them; a Gold Mine at their Door, and will not dig it.</P>
<P>It is true, the Reason is in part Evi∣dent, namely, Poverty; no Money to build Vessels, hire Seamen, buy Nets and Materials for Fishing, to cure the Fish when it is catch'd, or to carry it to M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rket when it is cured; and this dis∣courages the Mind, checks Industry, and prevents all manner of Application. Peo∣ple tell us, that Slothfulness begets Po∣verty, and it is true; but I must add too, that Poverty makes Slothfulness, and I doubt not were two or three brisk Mer∣chants to settle at Kirkubry, who had Stocks to furnish Ships and Boats for these Things, they would soon find the People as industrious; and as laborious as in other Places; or, if they did not find them so, when they felt the Benefit of it, tasted the Sweet of it, had Boats to Fish, and Merchants to Buy it when brought in; when they found the Money coming, they would soon Work. But to bid Men trade without Money, labour without Wages, catch Fish to have them stink, when they had done, is all one as to bid them work without Hands, or walk without Feet, 'tis the Poverty of the People makes them indolent.</P>
<P>Again, as the People have no Hands (that is, no Stock) to work, to the Gentry have no Genius to Trade; 'tis a Mechanism which they scorn; tho' their Estates are not able to feed them, they will not turn their Heads to Business or Improvement; they had rather see their Sons made Foot Soldiers, (than which, as Officers treat them now) there is not a more abject Thing on Earth, than see them apply to Trade, nay, to Merchan∣dize, or to the Sea, because those Things are not (forsooth) fit for Gentlemen.</P>
<P>In a Word, the common People all over this Country, not only are poor, but look poor; they appear dejected and discouraged, as if they had given over al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hopes of ever being otherwise than what they are. They are, indeed, a sober, grave, religious People, and that more, ordinarily speaking, than in any other Part of Scotland, far from what it is in England; Conversation is generally sober, grave; I assure you, they have no As∣semblies here, or Balls; and far from what it is in England, you hear no Oaths, or prophane Words in the Streets; and, if a mean Boy, such as we call Shoe-Blackers, or Black-Guard Boys, should be heard to swear, the next Gentleman in the Street, if any happened to be near him, would cane him, and correct him; whereas, in England, nothing is more frequent, or less regarded now, than the most horrid Oaths and Blasphemies in the open streets, and that by the little Chil∣dren that hardly know what an Oath means.</P>
<P>But this we cannot Cure, and, I doub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never shall; and in Scotland, but, espe∣cially in this Part of Scotland you have none of it to Cure.</P>
<P><PB REF="477"/>
It is the Honour of Scotland, that they are the strictest Observers of the Lord's Day of any Nation in the World; and, if any part of Scotland are more Observers of it than the Rest, it is in this Part, and all the Country f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om Dum∣fries, and the Parts adjacent, to Glasgow, and the Clyde, inclusive of both, the Towns of Dumfries and Glasgow; and tho' this Country of Galloway may be the poorest and empty of Commerce, it is, perhaps, the most religious Part of all Scotland. Some People, I know, will not think that an Equivalent for their Poverty; as to that, let every Body think for themselves; 'tis my Business only to relate the Fact, and represent Things as they are.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged, and there my Opinion concurs, they might be as religious and as serious as they are; and the more so, the better, and yet, they might at the same Time, be industrious, and apply themselves to Trade, and to reap the Advantages that Nature offers them; might build Ships, catch and cure Fish, and carry them to all the Markets in Europe, as the Giasgow Merchants shew the Example. But the Hindrance is in the Nature of the Thing, the Po∣verty of the Commons, and the Indo∣lence of the Gentry forbid it; and so Kirkubry, and all the Shores of Gallo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay must remain unnavigated; the sine harbours be unfrequented, the Fish be secu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and safe from Nets, till Time, and better Opportunities alter the Case, or a People better able, and more inclined to Business, comes among them, and leads them into it.</P>
<P>But I must speak no more in generals, I left Kirkubright with a sort of Con∣cern; it is so noble a Prospect, of what Business, and Commerce might, and I am persuaded, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or other will <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iver, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat enters the Sea here, and makes the fine Harbour I men∣tioned, is called the Dee, or the Dea, and is of a considerable long Course, com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of Mountains, in the remotest Norrh Angle of this Shire, towards Car∣rick; and, as it is full of Turnings and Meanders, more than any River in Scot∣land, is said to run near 200 Miles in its Course, as a River, tho' not above seventy Miles in a Line; it is sometimes on Occasion of Land Waters, a very great River, and remains so longer than is usual in other Rivers.</P>
<P>The Country of Galloway lies due West from Dumfries, and, as, that they call the Upper Galloway, runs out far∣ther than the rest, into the Irish Seas, all that Bay or Sea, on the South Side of it may be reckoned Part of Solway-Firth, as all on the North Side is called the Firth of Clyde, though near 100 Miles from the River itself; as all that Sea in England, between South Wales, and the North Coasts of Devon and Corn∣wall, is called the Severn Sea, even to the Lands End of England.</P>
<P>The Wester Galloway, which is also called the Shire of Wigtoun, from the Town of Wigtoun, its Capital, runs out with a Peniniula, so far into the Sea, that from the utmost Shores, you see the Coast of Ireland very plain, as you see Calais from Dover; and here is the Town of Port Patrick, which is the ordinary Place for the Ferry or Passage to Belfast or other Ports in Ireland It has a tolerable good Harbour, and a safe Road; but there is very little Use for it, for the Packet Boat, and a few fishing Vessels are the Sum of the Navigation; it is true, the Passage or Ferry is wide, and the Boats very indifferent, without the least Con∣venience or Accommodation; and yet, which is strange, they very rarely, if ever miscarry; nay, they told me there, they had never lost one in the memory of the oldest Man in the Town, except one full of Cattle; which, heeling to one side more than ordinary, all the Cattle run to that side, and as it were, slid out into the Sea.</P>
<P>Port Patrick has nothing in it to invite our stay, 'tis a mean dirty homely Place; and as we had no Business here, but to see the Coast, we came away very ill satisfied with our Accommodations. Upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="478"/>
near the Town, we could plainly see Ireland to the West, England, (viz.) the Coast of Cumberland to the South West, and the Isle of Isla, and the Mull of Kyntire to the North West.</P>
<P>As we pass'd the Peninsula, which is formed by two arms of the Sea, one on the North Side called Lochrain, and the other on the South, called the Bay of Glenluce, we stop'd at Stranrawer; in the very Neck of Land, between both these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulphs, are good Roads for Ships, and full of Fish, but still here is no Genius for Trade, or for Sea Affairs of any Kind.</P>
<P>But now having said thus much of the Stupidity of the People of Galloway, and especially on the Sea Coast, for not falling into Mercandizing; Fishing, &amp;c. which would doubtless turn to great Ac∣count: I must premise two Things, that I may not lead the Reader into an Error.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not so with all the People on this Western Coast of Scotland, as we shall soon see in the other Coun∣tries, upon the Coast of Clyde, far∣ther North, up to, and inclusive of Glasgow itself.</P>
<P N="2">2. The People of Galloway itself are are not perfectly Idle, and neither the Country, or the People capable of any Thing; if it were so, the Place would be uninhabited, and, in∣deed, unhabitable; whereas, on the contrary, it is very populous, and full of Inhabitants, as well of Noble∣men and Gentlemen, as of common People; all, which, I shall explain in few Words.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not so with all the People, they are not all stupid, and without any No∣tions of Commerce, Navigation, Ship∣ping, Fishing, &amp;c. that is to say, tho' in Galloway they are generally so, from the Coast, a little West of Dumfries, that is, from the Mouth of the River Fleet, yet to the Northward, and upon the Coast of Air, Kyle, and Cunningham; it is quite another Thing, as you shall hear presently.</P>
<P N="2">2. The People of Galloway do not starve; tho' they do not fish, build Ships, trade Abroad, &amp;c. yet they have other Business, that is to say, they are mee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cultivaters of the Earth, and in particu∣lar, breeders of Cattle, such as Sheep, the Number of which I may say is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is to say, innumerable; and bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k Cattle, of which they send to England, if Fame lies not, 50 or 60000 every Year, the very Toll of which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Union, was a little Estate to some G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣men upon the Borde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Earl of Carlisle had a very good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣come by it.</P>

<P>Coming to the North Bounds of Car∣rick, we pass'd the River Dun, upon a Bridge of one Arch, the largest I ever saw, much larger than the Rialto at Venice, or the middle Arch of the great Bridge at York; we find many such in this Country, though, I think none so very wide, except a Bridge between Glasgow and Sterling; which, indeed, I did not measure, though we might have done it, there being then no Water in the River. But this the People assured us, was almost thirty Yards in Diameter, which, as I take it, is thirteen Foot wider than the Rialto.</P>
<P>This Bridge led us into the County of Kyle, the Second Division of the Shire of Air; and here I observ'd, that, con∣trary to what is usual, the farther North we travelled, the better, finer, and richer the Country was, whereas, ordinarily the farther North we expect it to be the worse.</P>
<P>Kyle is much better inhabited than Car∣rick, as Carrick is better than Galloway; and as the Soil here is better, and the Country plainer and leveller, so on the Banks of the River, here are Abundance of Gentlemens Seats, some of them well planted, tho' most of the Houses are old built, that is, Castle-wise, because of E∣nemies. But now that Fear is over they begin to plant, and enclose after the Man∣ner of England; and the Soil is also en∣couraging, for the Land is fruitful.</P>
<P>Our Scotch Writers tell us a long Story of a great Battle in this Country, between King Coilus or Cylus a British King, and their Fergus I. where the former was kil∣led, and from thence the Country took
<PB REF="480"/>
his Name; also another bloody Battle, An. 1263. between King Alexander III. of Scotland, and one Acho King of Nor∣way, who came to the Port of Air with a great Fleet of Ships, and 20000 Men on Board who, after ravaging the Coun∣try, was routed, and lost both his Army, and 140 Sail of his Ships. But these Scots Legends I shall say nothing to.</P>
<P>The Capital of this Country is Air, a Sea Port, and as they tell us, was for∣merly a large City, had a good Har∣bour, and a great Trade: I must acknow¦ledge to you; that tho' I believe it never was a City, yet it has certainly been a good Town, and much bigger than it is now: At present like an old Beauty, it shews the Ruins of a good Face; but is also apparently, not only decay'd and de∣clin'd, but decaying and declining every Day, and from being the fifth Town in Scotland, as the I ownsmen say, is now like a Place forsaken; the Reason of its Decay, is, the Decay of its Trade, so true is it, that Commerce is the Life of Nations, of Cities, Towns, Harbours, and of the whole Prosperity of a Coun∣try: What the Reason of the decay of Trade here was, or when it first began to decay, is hard to determine; nor are the People free to tell, and perhaps, do not know themselves. There is a good Ri∣ver here, and a handsome Stone Bridge of four Arches.</P>
<P>The Town is well situated, has a very large ancient Church, and has still a very good Market for all Sorts of Provision. But nothing will saye it from Death, if Trade does not revive, which the Towns∣men say it begins to do since the U∣nion.</P>
<P>From Air, keeping still North, we came to Irwin, upon a River of the same Name; but barr'd and difficult, and not very good, when you are in; and yet, here is more Trade than at Air; nay, than at all the Ports between it and Dum∣fries, exclusive of the last; particularly here is a considerable Trade for Scots Coal, of which they have plenty in the Neigh∣bouring Hills, and which they carry by Sea to Ireland, to Belfast, to Carickfer∣gus, and to Dublin itself, and the Com∣merce occasioned by this Navigation be¦tween the two Countries is very consi¦derable, and much to the Advantage o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Town of Irwin. They have also o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> late, as I was told, launched into a con∣derable Trade Abroad to other Coun¦tries, and have some share in the Fishe∣ry: But this I cannot come into the Particulars of here. The Town is the Capital of that Division of the Shire <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, which they call Cunningham, and is really within the Firth of Clyde, though not actually within the River itself; they stand so advantagiously for the Her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, Fishing, that they cannot but go beyond their Neighbours of Greenock, who some times cannot come out as the Wind may blow, when the Fishing Boats of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can both go and return.</P>
<P>As the Town is better employ'd it Trade than the other Parts I have been speaking of, it is better built: Here are two handsome Streets, a good Key, and not only Room in the Harbour for a great many Ships, but a great many Ships in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also; and, in a Word, a Face of Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ing appears every where among them.</P>
<P>As is the Town, so is the Country in which it is situated; for when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came hither, we thought ourselves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England. Here we saw no more Gal∣loway, where you have neither Hedg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Tree, but about the Gentlemen's Houses whereas here you have beautiful Enclo∣sures, pleasant Pastures, and Grass Ground<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and consequently store of Cattle <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and provided.</P>
<P>The whole Country is rich and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> filled with Gentlemen's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> well-built Houses: It is said this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Country was owing to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Soldiers, who were placed here <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Kyle by Oliver Cromwell; for at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he built a Citadel, the visible Appearanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which remain still, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Soldiers prompted and encouraged <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People to enclose and improve <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>A little from Irwin is Kilmarnock Ca∣stle, the Seat of the Family of Boy'd, Earl of Kilmarnock; and on the other side the Castle of Eglington, the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of the Fa∣mily of Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gomery, Earl of Eglington, an ancient House; and the present E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl is one of the richest Peers in Scotland.

<P>It is a pleasant, rich, and populous, tho' small country, lying on the South Bank of the Clyde; the soil is not thought to be so good as in Cunningham: But that is abundantly supplied by the many good Towns, the Neighbourhood of Glasgow, and of the Clyde, and great Commerce of both. We kept our Rout as near along the coast as we could, from Ir∣w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; so that we saw all the coast of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of Clyde, and the very Opening of the Clyde itself, which is just at the West Point, or corner of this county, for it comes to a narrow Point just in that Place. There are some Villages and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing Towns within the Mouth of the Clyde, which have more Business than large Port Towns in Galloway and Greenock; 'tis not an ancient Place, but seems to be grown up in later Years, only by being a good Road for ships, and where the ships ride that come into, and go out from Glasgow, just as the ships for London do in the Downs.

<P><PB REF="482"/>
I am now come to the Bank of Clyde: My Method here as in England, forbids me wandring North, till I have given you a full View of the South. Two Rivers seem to cross Scotland here, as the Trent and the Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee cross England in the South, or as the Tyne and the Eden cross it in the North, or as the two Calders cross it in Yorkshire and Lancashire, which rise both out of the same Hill, and within a Mile of each other, and run one into the German Ocean at Hull and the other entring first into the Ribble, runs into the Irish Sea below Preston.</P>
<P>Thus this Clyde and the Tweed may be said to cross Scotland in the South, their Sources being not many Miles a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un∣der; and the two Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs, from the Firth of Clyde to the Firth of F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th, have not an Interval of above twelve or fourteen Miles, which, if they were join'd, as might easily be done, they might cro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Scotland, as I might say, in the very Center,</P>
<P>Nor can I refrain mentioning how easy a Work it would be to form a Navigati∣on, I mean a Navigation of Art from the Forth to the Clyde, and so join the two Seas, as the King of France has done in a Place five times as far, and five Hun∣dred times as difficult, namely from Thou∣loze to Narbonne. What an Advantage in Commerce would this be, opening the Irish Trade to the Merchants of Glas∣gow▪ making a Communication between the West Coast of Scotland, and the East Coast of England, and even to London itself; nay, several Ports of England, on the Irish Sea, from Liverpool Northward, would all Trade with London by such a Canal, it would take up a Volume by it∣self, to lay down the several Advantages to the Trade of Scotland, that would im∣mediately occur by such a Navigation, and then to give a true Survey of the Ground, the Easiness of its being per∣formed, and the probable Charge of it, all which might be done; But it is too much to undertake here, it must lye till Posterity, by the rising Greatness of their Commerce, shall not only feel the Want of it, but find themselves able for the Performance</P>
<P>I mentioned the neighbouring Situation of the Clyde▪ and the Forth in this Place, only to observe that I make that Line the Bound of this Circuit, and shall speak of nothing beyond it till my next. Suppos∣ing a Line drawn from Dunbarton to Sterling, exclusive of the first, and in∣clusive of the last; or rather suppose it drawn from Glasgow to Sterling, inclusive of both, because both relate to the South or Lowland Part of Scotland.</P>
<P>I am now cross'd the Clyde to Glas∣gow▪ and I went over dry-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooted with∣out the Bridge; on which Occasion I can∣not but observe h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w differing a Face the River presented itself in, at those two several Times when only I was there; At the first, being in the Month of June, the River was so low, that not the Horses and Carts only pass'd it just above the Bridge, but the Children and Boys play∣ing about, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt every where, as if there was no River, only some little spreading Brook, or Wash, like such as we have at Enfield-Wash, or Chelston▪Wash in Mid∣dlelex; and, as I told you, cross'd it Dry foot, that is, the Water was scarce over the Horses Hoofs.</P>
<P>As for the Bridge, which is a lofty stately Fabrick; it stood out of the Wa∣ter as naked as a Skeleton, and looked somewhat like the Bridge over the Man∣sanares, near Madrid, which I mention∣ed once before; of which a French Am∣bassador told the People the Kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should either buy them a River, or sell their Bridge, or like the Stone Bridge at Chester in the Street, in Northumberland, where the Road goes in the River, and the Peo∣ple ride under the Bridge in dry Weather instead of riding over it. So when I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aw such a magnificent Bridge at Glasgow, and especially when I saw three of the middle Arches so exceeding large and high, beyond all the rest, I could not but wonder, hardly thinking it possible, that where the Passage or Channel is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o ex∣ceeding
<PB REF="483"/>
Broad, for the Bridge consists of eight Arches; the River, which in its ordinary Channel is so narrow as it is higher up, and at a Distance from it, could ever fill up such a Height, where it has so grand a Space to spread itself as at the Bridge.</P>
<P>But my next Journey satisfy'd me, when coming into Glasgow from the East Side, I found the River not only had filled up all the Arches of the Bridge, but, running about the End of it, had fill'd the Streets of all that Part of the City next the Bridge, to the infinite Damage of the Inhabitants▪ besides putting them into the greatest Consternation imaginable, for fear of their Houses being driven away by the Violence of the Water, and the whole City was not without Apprehen∣sions that their Bridge would have given Way too, which would have been a ter∣rible Loss to them, for 'tis as fine a Bridge as most in Scotland.</P>
<P>Glasgow is, indeed, a very fine City; the four principal Streets are the fairest for Breadth, and the finest built that I have ever seen in one City together. The Houses are all Stone, and generally equal and uniform in Height, as well as in Front; the lower Story generally stands on vast Square Dorick Columns, not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound Pillars and Arches between give Passage into the Shops, adding to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rength as well as Beauty of the Build∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g; in a Word, 'tis the cleanest and beau∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullest, and best built City in Britain, London excepted.</P>
<P>It stands on the Side of a Hill, sloping <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the River, with this Exception, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Part next the River is slat, as is said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bove, for near one third Part of the Ci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and that exposed it to the Water, up∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the extraordinary Flood mention'd just <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow.</P>
<P>Where the Streets meet, the crossing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>akes a spacious Market place by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture of the Thing, because the Streets <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o large of themselves. As you come <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wn the Hill, from the North Gate to he said Cryss, the Tolbooth, with the Stad-honse, or Guild-Hall, make the North East Angle, or, in English, the Right∣hand Corner of the Street, the Building very noble and very strong, a cending by large Stone Steps, wi h a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Here the Town Council sit and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Ma∣gistrates try Causes, such as com with n their Cognizance, and do all t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir pub∣lick Business.</P>
<P>On the Left hand of the same Street is the University; the Building is the best of any in Scotland of the Kind; it was founded by Bishop Turnbull, Ann. 1454. but has been much enlarged since, and the Fabrick almost all new built. It is a very spacious Building, contains two large Square, or Courts, and the Lodgings for the Scholars, and for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Professors, are very handsome, the whole Building is of Freestone, v ry high and very august. Here is a Principal, with Regents and Professors in every Science, as there is at Edinburgh, and the Scholars wear Gowns, which they do not at Edinburgh Their Gowns here are red, but the Masters of Arts▪ and Professors, wear black Gowns, with a large Cape of Velvet to distinguish them.</P>
<P>The Cathedral is an antient Building, and has a Square Tower in the Middle of the Cross, with a very handsome Spire upon it, the highest that I saw in Scotland, and, indeed, the on y one that is to be called high. This, like St. G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les's at Ed∣i burgh is divided now, and makes th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Churches, and, I suppose, here is four or five more in the City, besides a Meeting or two: But there are very few of the Episcopal D ssenters here; and the Mob fell upon one of their Meetings so often, that they were obliged to lay it down, or, if they do meet, 't<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s very privately.</P>

<P>Could this City but have a communi∣cation with the Firth of Forth, so as to send their Tobacco and Sugar by Water to Alloway, below Sterling as they might from thence again to London, Holland, Hambrough, and the Baltick, they would, (for ought I know that should hinder it) in a few Years double their Trade, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end 100 Sail, or more.</P>

<P>As Scotland never enjoy'd a Trade to the English Plantations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> since the Uni∣on, so no Town in Scotland has yet done any Thing considerable in it but Glas∣gow: The Merchants of Edinburgh have attempted it; but they lye so out of the Way, and the Voyage is not only so much the longer, but so much more ha∣zardous, that the Glasgow Men are always sure to outdo them, and must consequently carry away that Part of Trad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fr m them, as likewise the Trade to the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u h, and to the Mediterranean, whether the ships from Glasgow go and come again with great Advantage in the Risque, so that even in the Insuring there is one per Cent.

<P>Nor are the Scots without a Supply Goods for sorting their Cargoes to English Colonies, even without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to England for them, or at least not many of them; and 'tis needful to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion it here, because it has been ob∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by some that understood Trade <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the Scots could not send a sort∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cargo to America without buying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> England; which Goods, so bought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must come through many Hands, by long Carriage, and consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear bought, and so the English Mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts might undersell them.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to answer this in the Language of Merchants, as it is a Merchant like Ob∣jection: It may be true, that some Things cannot be had so well as from Eng∣land, so as to make out a sortable Car∣go, such as the Virginia Merchants in London ship off, whose Entries at the Custom house consist sometimes of 200 Particulars; and they are at last fain to sum them up thus: Certain Tin, Turnery, Millinary, Upholdstery, Cutlery, and Crooked-Lane Wares; that is to say, that they buy Something of every Thing, either for Wearing, or Kitchen, or House-Furniture, building Houses or Ships (with every Thing else in short) that can be thought of, except Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing.</P>
<P>But though the Scots cannot do this, we may reckon up what they can fur∣nish, and what is sufficient, and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of which they can go beyond England in.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have several Woollen Manu∣factures which they send of their own Making; such as the Sterling Serges, Musclebrow Stuffs, Aberdeen Stockings, Edinburgh Shalloons, Blankets, &amp;c. So that they are not quite destitute in the Woollen Manu∣facture, tho' that is the principal Thing in which England can outdo them.</P>
<P N="2">2 The Trade with England being open, they have now, all the Manchester Wares, Sheffield Wares, and New∣castle hard Wares; as also the Cloths, Kerleys, Half thicks, Dussels, Stock∣ings, and coarse Manufactures of the North of England, as cheap brought to them by Horse▪packs as they can be carried to London, nor is the Carriage farther, and, in some Articles, not so far by much.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have Linnens of most Kinds, especially Diapers and Table Lin∣nen, Damasks, and many other Sorts not known in England, cheaper than England, because made at their own Doors.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="486"/>
4. What Linnens they want from Hol∣land, or Hamburgh, they import from thence as cheap as can be done in England; and for Muslins, their own are very acceptable, and chea∣per than in England.</P>
<P N="5">5. Gloves they make better and chea∣per than in England, for they send great Quantities thither.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another Article, which is very con∣siderable here, is Servants, and these they have in greater Plenty, and up∣on better Terms than the English; without the scandalous Art of Kid∣napping, making Drunk, Wheedling, Betraying, and the like; the poor Peo∣ple offering themselves fast enough, and thinking it their Advantage to go; as indeed it is, to those who go with sober Resolutions, namely, to serve out their Times, and then be∣come diligent Planters for them∣selves; and this would be a much wiser Course in England than to turn Thieves, and worse, and then be sent over by Force, and as a Pre∣tence of Mercy to save them from the Gallows.</P>
<P>This may be given as Reason, and, I belive, is the only Reason why so many more of the Scots Servants, which go over to Virginia, settle and thrive there than of the English, which is so certainly true, that if it goes on for many Years more, Vir∣ginia may be rather call'd a Scots than an English Plantation.</P>
<P>I might go on to many other Particu∣lars, but this is sufficient to shew that the Scots Merchants are at no Loss how to make up sortable Cargoes to send with their Ships to the Plantations, and that if we can out do them in some Things, they are able to outdo us in others; if they are under any Disadvantages in the Trade I am speaking of, it is that they may per∣haps, not have so easy a Vent and Con∣sumption for the Goods they bring back, as the English have, at London, or Bristol, or Liverpool; and that is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reason why they are now, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> setting up a Wharf and Convenienc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Alloway in the Forth, in Order to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Tobacco's and Sugars thither <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Land-Carriage, and Ship them off the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Holland, or Hamburgh or London, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Market presents.</P>
<P>Now, though this may be some Ad∣vantage (viz) carrying the Tobacco fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fourteen to fifteen Miles over Land: ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if on the other Hand it be calculated ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much sooner the Voyage is made fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Glasgow to the Capes of Virginia. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from London, take it one Time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Difference will be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Freight, and in the Expence <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and especially in Time of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Channel is throng'd with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> when the Ships wait to go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fear of Enemies; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Men are no sooner out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> but they stretch away <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> are out of the Wake of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> im∣mediately, and are oftentimes at the Capes of Virginia before the London <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> get clear of the Channel.

<P>The Front is very magnificent indeed, all of white Freestone, with regular Or∣naments according to the Rules of Art: The Wings are very deep, and when the other Wings come to be added, if ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be, the two Sides of the House <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen be like two large Fronts rather than Wings; not unlike Beddington House, near Croydon in Surry, only much larger.</P>

That Match being blest with a truly glorious Succes∣sion of six Sons, four of whom were Peers by Birth, or Creation (viz) The late Duke, or rather Earl of Arran, his Mother being alive, the Earls of Orkney, Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rk, and Ruglen, besides the Lords Basil and Archibald Hamilton. But this by the Way:</P>
<P>The Situation of the House is fix'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Advantage imaginable; it stands n a plain, level Country, near enough to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Banks of the Clyde to enjoy the Prospect of its Stream, and yet far enough <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd high enough to be out of the Reach <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f its Torrents and Floods, which, as you ave heard, are sometimes able to terrify <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole City.</P>
<P>The great Park is said to be six Miles <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Circumference, wall'd round with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, but rough, and not well lay'd; the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler Park is rather a great Enclosure than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Park, yet they are both extremely well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted with Trees, and add to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nament of the whole. The great Park also is well stock'd with Deer, and among them some very curious for the Kind, whether Natives of the Place, or of foreign Breed, I could not learn. The Gardens are finely designed, but I cannot say they are so finely finished, or so nicely kept as those at Drumlanrig, particularly the Court-yard, the Canals and Ponds, de∣signed with some other Gardens laid out in the first Plan, are not compleated, and some not so much as begun upon: So that the next Heirs have Room enough to divert themselves▪ and dispose of some of their spare Treasure, to carry on and commpleat the true Design of their An∣cestor.</P>
<P>The Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fortune of the late Heir, the Father of the present Duke, happen'd so, as that he never came to the Estate, for he was kill'd before the Duchess Dowager died; so that the Estate, as I observ'd, be∣ing her own; remain'd in her Hands till afterward; whether this might not be the better for the present Heir, I shall not de∣termine, let others judge of that.</P>
<P>I was here in some Doubt, whether I should take the South or the North in the next Part of my Progress; that is to say, whether to follow up th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clyde, and so into, and throguh Clydsdale, and then crossing East, view the Shire of Peebles, the Country on the Banks of Tweed and Tivyot, or keeping to the North, go on for the Forth, and after a short Debate we concluded on the latter. So we turn'd to the left for Sterling-Shire, and passing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Clyde we came to Kil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yth, a good plain Country Burgh, tolerably well built, but not large; here we rested, and upon a particular Occasion went to see the antient Seat of Calendar, which seems, as well as that of Kil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yth, to be in 'its Widows Weeds, those two Families▪ collateral Branches both of the Name o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Livingston, having had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are, but little cays, though on differen Earl of Mar, of the Town of Falkirk is near aims to be Here∣but nothing in it remarking's Children, other old decay'd House of as Calendar.</P>

Here I must take Notice, though, as I have often said, Antiquity is not my Bu∣siness, that we saw the Remains, and that very plain, of the antient Work, which they call Severus's Wall, or Hadrian's Wall, or Grahams Dyke, for it is known by all these: The short of which Story is this; that the Romans finding it not on∣ly difficult, but useless to them, to con∣quer the Northern Highlands, and impos∣sible to keep them, if conquer'd; con∣tented themselves to draw a Line, so we now call it, cross this narrow part of the Country, and fortify it with Redoubts, and Stations of Soldiers to confine the Picts and Irish, and those wild Nations which were without▪ and defend the South Country from their Incursions, This Wall reach'd from Dunbriton Firth, so they call'd the Firth o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Clyde, to the Forth, and was several times restor'd and repair'd, till the Roman Empire's declin∣ing, as is well known in Story Tho' neither this, or the yet stronger Wall at New-Castle, call'd the Picts Wall, could preserve the Country from the Invasion of the Picts, and the barbarous Nations that came with them.</P>
<P>From Kilsyth we mounted the Hills black and frightful as they were, to find the Road over the Moors and Mountains to Sterling, and before directed by our Guides, came to the River Caaron: The Channel of a River appear'd, indeed, and running between horrid Precipices of Rocks, as if cut by Hand, no purpose for the River to make its Way; but not a Drop Water was to be seen. Great stones, square and form'd, as if cut out by Hand, of a prodigious size, some of them at least a Ton▪ or Ton and half in Weight, lay scatter'd, and confusedly, as it were, jum∣bled together in the very Course of the River, which the Fury of the Water, at other Times, I doubt not, had hurried down from the Mountains, and tumbled them thus over one another: Some of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I suppose, have been some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Journey down the Stream; for it may not be once in some Years that a Flood comes with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sufficient to move such Stones as tho▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and, 'tis probable, 'tis never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when a Weight of Ice, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may come down upon them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

The Town is situated as like Edinburgh as almost can be describ'd, being on the Ridge of a Hill, sloping down on both Sides, and the Street ascending from the East gradually to the Castle, which is at the West End; the Street is large and well built, but ancient, and the Buildings not unlike Edinburgh, either for Beauty or Sight</P>
<P>The Church is also a very spacious Building, but not Collegiate; there was formerly a Church, or rather Chapel, in the Castle, but it is now out of Use; also a private Chapel, or Oratory in the Palace▪ for the Royal Family: But all that is now laid aside too</P>
<P>The Castle is not so very difficult of A ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s as Edinburgh; but it is esteem'd equally strong, and particularly the Works are capable to mount more Cannon, and these Cannon are better pointed; particu∣larly there is a Battery which commands, or may command the Bridge; the com∣mand of which is of the utmost impor∣tance; nay, it is the main End and Pur∣pose for which, as we are told, the Castle was built.</P>

<P>In the Park, adjoining to the Castle, were formerly large Gardens, how fine they were I cannot say; the Figure of the Walks and Grass▪Plats remains plain to be seen, they are very old fashion'd; but I suppose the Gardens might be thought fine, as Gardens were then; particularly they had not then the Usage of adorning their Gardens with Ever-Greens, trimm'd and shap'd; Trees espa∣lier'd into Hedges and such like, as now: They had, indeed, Statnes and Busts, Vala, and Fountains, Flowers and Fruit; but we make Gardens fine now many Ways, which those Ages had no Genius for; as by Scrouls, Embroidery, Pavilli∣ons, Terrasses and Slop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Pyramids and high Espaliers, and a Thousand Orna∣ments, which they had no Notion of.</P>

as also Hereditary Keeper of the Castle, has a House at the upper End of the Town, and very finely situated for Prospect, but I cannot say it is so for any Thing else, for it is too near the Castle; and was the Castle ever to suffer a close Siege, and be vigorously defended, that House would run great Risques of being de∣molished on one Side or other; it stands too near the Castle also for the Sight of it to be agreeable.</P>
<P>The Governor's Lady (who was the Countess Dowager of Marr, when we were there, and Mother of the late ex∣iled Earl of Marr, had a very pretty little Flower-Garden, upon the Body of one of the Bastions, or Towers of the Castle, the Ambrusiers serving for a Dwarf∣wall round the most Part of it; and they walked to it from her Ladyship's Apart∣ment upon a Level, along the Castle-Wall.</P>
<P>As this little, but very pleasant Spot, was on the North Side of the Castle, we had from thence a most agreeable Pros∣pect indeed over the Valley and the Ri∣ver; as it is truly beautiful, so it is what the People of Sterling justly boast of, and, indeed, seldom forget it, I mean the Meanders, or Reaches of the River Forth. They are so spacious, and return <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o near themselves, with so regular and exact a Sweep, that, I think, the like is not to be seen in Britain, if it is in Europe, especially where the River is so large also.</P>
<P>The River Sein, indeed▪ between Paris and Roan, fetches a Sweep something like these some Miles longer, but then it is but one; whereas here are three double Reaches, which make six Returns to∣gether, and each of them three long Scots Miles, or more in Length; and as the Bows are almost equal for Breadth, as the Reaches are for Length, it makes the Fi∣gure compleat. It is an admirable Sight indeed, and continues from a little be∣low the great Bridge at Sterling to Allo∣way, the Seat of the present, or rather late Earl of Marr, the present Earl being attainted for Treason, and so dead, as a Peer or Earl, though alive in Exile. The Form of this Winding may be conceiv∣ed of a little by the Length of the Way for it is near twenty Miles from Sterling to Alloway by Water, and hardly four Miles by Land.</P>
<P>One would think these large Sweeps, or Windings of the Stream should check the Tide very much: But, on the con∣trary, we found the Tide of Flood made up very strong under Sterling bridge, even as strong almost as at London-bridge, but does not flow above seven or eight Miles farther: The Stream of the River growing narrow apace, and the rapid Current of all Rivers in that Country Checking the Tide, when it comes into narrow Limits; the fame is the Case in the Tyne at Newcastle, and the Tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> d at Berwick; in both which, though the Tide flows strong in at the Mouth of the Rivers, yet the Navigation goes but a very little Way up, nothing near what it does in this River.</P>
<P>The Bridge at Sterling has but four Arches, as I remember, but they are very large, and the Channel widens consider∣ably below it; at Alloway 'tis above a Mile broad, and deep enough for Ships of any Burthen. So that the Glasgow Merchants cannot but be in the Right to settle a Ware-house, or Ware-houses, or whatever they will call them here, to Ship off their Goods for the Eastern Countries.</P>
<P>I was▪ indeed, curious to enquire into the Course of this River, as I had been before into that of the Clyde as to the Possibility of their Waters being united for an Inland Navigation; because I had observed that the Charts and Plans of the Country brought them almost to meet; but when I came more critically to sur∣vey the Ground, I found the Map makers greatly mistaken, and that they had not only given the Situation and Countes of the Rivers wrong▪ but the Distances also. However, upon the whole, I brought it to this; that notwithstanding several Cir∣cumstances
<PB REF="493"/>
which might obstruct it, and cause the Workmen to fetch some wind∣ing Turns out of the Way, yet, that in the whole, a Canal of about eight Miles in Length would fairly join the Rivers, and make a clear Navigation from the Irish to the German Sea; and that this would be done without any consider∣able Obstruction; so that there would not need above four Sluices in the whole Way, and those only to head a Bason, or Receptacle, to contain a Flash, or Flush of Water to push on the Vessels this Way or that, as Occasion required, not to stop them to raise or let fall, as in the Case of Locks in other Rivers.</P>
<P>How easy then such a Work would be, and how advantagious, not to Scotland only, but even to Ireland and England also, I need not explain, the Nature of the Thing will explain itself. I could en∣ter upon particular Descriptions of the Work, and answer the Objections rais'd from the great Excess of Waters in these Streams in the Winter, and the Force and Fury of their Streams; But 'tis need∣less, nor have we Room for such a Work here; besides, all those who are acquaint∣ed with such Undertakings, know that artificial Canals are carefully secur'd from any Communication with other Waters, except just as their own Occasion for the Navigating Part demands; and that they are so order'd, as to be always in a Con∣dition to take in what Water they want, and cast off what would be troublesome to them, by proper Channels and Sluices made for that Purpose.</P>
<P>Those Gentlemen who have seen the Royal Canal in Languedoc from Narbon to Thoulouse, as many in Scotland have, will be able to support what I say in this Case, and to understand how easily the same Thing is to be practis'd here; but I leave it to Time, and the Fate of Scot∣land, which, I am perswaded, will one Time or other bring it to pass.</P>
<P>There is a very good Hospital at the upper End of this Town for poor decay'd Tradesmen Merchants. They told us it was for none but Merchants, which pre∣sently brought Sir John Morden's Hos∣pital upon Black-Heath to my Thoughts; but I had forgotten where I was: And that in Scotland every Country Shop∣keeper, nay, almost every Pether is cal∣led a Merchant; which, when I was put in Mind of, I understood the Foundation of the Hospital better.</P>
<P>There is a ve y considerable Manufac∣ture at Sterling, for what they call Ster∣ling Serges, which are in English, Shal∣loons; and they both make them and dye them there very well; nor has the English Manufacture of Shalloons broke in so much upon them by the late Union, as it was fear'd they would. This Manufac∣ture employs the Poor very comfortable here, and is a great Part of the Support of the Town as to Trade, showing what Scotland might soon be brought to by the Help of Trade and Manufactures; for the People are as willing to work here as in England, if they had the same En∣couragement, that is, if they could be constantly employ'd and paid for it too, as they are there.</P>
<P>The Family of Eresk in is very conside∣rable here; and besides the Earl of Marr and the Earl of Buchan, who are both of that Name, there are several Gentlemen of Quality of the same Name; as Sir John Ereskine of Alva, Colonel Ereskine, at that Time Governor of the Castle; and another Colonel Ereskine, Uncle to the Earl of Buchan, a very whorthy and va∣luable Gentleman, who, tho' he does not live at Sterling, has a considerable Interest there, and was at that Time Honourary Lord Provost of the Town.</P>
<P>We had here a very fine Prospect both East and West; Eastward we could plainly see the Castle of Edinburgh, and the Hill call'd Arthur's Seat, in the Royal Park at Haly-Rood-House; also the Opening Firth presents all the Way from Alloway to the Queens-Ferry, mention'd above. North we co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld see Dumfermling, and the Field of Battle, call'd Sheriff mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, bet∣ween it and Sterling; and some told us
<PB REF="494"/>
we might see Dumba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton Castle West; but it was hazy that Way, so that we could not see it, the Prospect South is confin'd by the Hills.</P>
<P>But our Business was not to the North yet; still having a Part of the Border to view, that we might leave nothing be∣hind us to oblige us to come this Way again: So we went from Sterling, first East and then South East, over some of the same Hills, which we pass'd at our coming hither, though not by the same Road The Duke of Argyle has a small House, which the Family called the Low∣land House, I suppose in Distinction from the many fine Seats and strong Castles which they were always possess'd of in the Highlands: This Seat was formerly belonging to the Earls of Sterling; and the County round it, South of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth, is called Sterlingshire, or Strivelingshere, and sends a Member to Parliament, as a Shire or County. The Family of the Earls of Sterling is extinct, at least, if there are any of the Name, as is alledg'd▪ they live obscurely in England. They make great Complaint at Sterling, which they deprive from the Papists, that the old Earl of Marr, who built the Family-House under the Castle, as I have just now said, was a Clergyman and Prior, or Abbot of the famous Monastery of Gambuskeneth, a Religious House, of the Order of the Augustines, which stood not far off.</P>
<P>That upon the Reformation the said Abbot turn'd Protestaut and married, and was created Earl of Marr: That he was so zealous afterwards for the Change of Religion, that he set his Hand to the demolishing his own Monastery; and that he brought away the Stones of it to Sterling, and built this fine House with them; upon which the Romanists branded him with Sacrilege and Avarice together, and gave him their Curse, which is not unusual in Scotland; which Curse, they tell you, now fell upon even the House itself, for that the Family being Heredi∣tary Governors of Sterling Castle; and besides, having another House at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way, four Miles from it, the new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House was never inhabited to this D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at least not by the Family to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> belong'd, aud is at last forfeited to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Crown.</P>
<P>This Clamour, however, did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him from going on with his House which he finish'd, as you see; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supposed those Reproaches occasioned his setting up several inscriptions, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> withou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the House as within; some of them are worn out with Time, others are legible; whereof this Distich in a Scots Dialect, I think, points at the Case.</P>
<Q><L>Speak forth, and spare nocht,</L>
<L>Consider well, I care nocht,</L></Q>
<P>The Words seem to want a Paraphrase, which I shall make as short <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as the Lines, though nor in Rhime; I take it to import much like the Duke of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inscription on the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ze of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> new House in the Park at St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Spectator fastidiosns sibi molestus▪</HI> the Builder had heard the Rumou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and Re∣proaches of the People, but bids them speak out plainly, and say their worst; for that, if they consider'd well, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould say nothing but what was true, he had nothing to be concern'd at.</P>
<P>From Sterling, as I said, we came away West, and went directly to Lithgow, or Linlithgow, and from thence to Clysdale, that is to say, the Country upon the Banks of the Clyde; in doing which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we pass'd the old Roman Work a second Time, which I still call Severus's W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, because we are assured Severus was the last that repaired it, though he might not make it; and more especially, because the Men of Learning there generally call it so; the Remains of it are very plain to be seen.</P>
<P>There is nothing remarkable between Sterling and Lithgow but Bannockburn, which I have mentioned already, and some private Gentlemens Seats, too ma∣ny to repeat.</P>
<P><PB REF="495"/>
Lithgow is a large Town, well built, and antiently famous for the noble Pa∣lace of the Kings of Scotland, where K. James VI. and his Queen kept their Court in great Magnificence. This Court, though decaying with the rest, is yet less decay'd, because much later repaired than others; for King James repaired, or ra∣ther rebuilt some of it: And his two Sons, Prince Henry, and Prince Charles, af∣terwards King of England, had Apart∣ments here; and there are the Prince of Wales's Arms, over those, called the Princes Lodgings to this Day. Here it was that the Good Lord Murray, the Regent, who they called Good, because he was really so as he was riding through the Town into the Palace, was shot most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illainously from a Window, and the Mur∣derer was discovered. He died of the Wound with the utmost Tranquility and Resignation, after having had the Satis∣faction of being the paincipal Man in settling the Reformation in Scotland in such a Manner, as it was not possible for the Popish Party to recover themselves again; And after seeing the common Peo∣ple over the whole Kingdom embrace the Reformation, almost universally, to his great Joy, for he was the most zea∣lous of all the Nobility in the Cause of the Reformation, and unalterably resolved never to give Way to the least Allowance to the Popish Court, who then began to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave only a Toleration for themselves, but could never obtain it; for this Reason the Papists mortally hated him, and, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ength, murdered him. But they got little by his Death, for the Reformers went on with the same Zeal, and never left, till they had entirely driven Queen Mary, and all her Popish Adherents out of the Kingdom, yet we do not find the true <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urderer was ever discovered: But this is latter of History.</P>
<P>At Lithgow there is a very great Linnen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anufacture, as there is at Glasgow; and the Water of the Lough or Lake here, is esteemed with the best in Scotland for Bleaching or Whitening of Linnen Cloth: So that a great deal of Linnen, made in other Parts of the Country, is brought <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther either to be bleach'd or whiten'd.</P>
<P>The Church of St. Michael makes a Part of the Royal Building, and is the Wing on the Right Hand of the first Court, as all the proper Offices of the Court made the Left: But the inner Court is the Beauty of the Building, was very spacious, and, in those Days, was thought glorious. There is a large Fountain in the middle of the Court, which had then Abundance of fine Things about it, where∣of some of the Carvings remain still.</P>
<P>Here the King's of Scotland, for some Ages kept their Courts on Occasion of any extraordinary Cetemony. And here K. James V. reinstituted, or rather restored the Order of Knights of St. Andrew, as the Order of Knights of the Bath were lately restored in England. Here he erected Stalls, and a Throne for them in St. Michael's Church, and made it the Chapel of the Order, according to the Usage at Windsor: The King himself wore the Badges of four Orders (viz) That of the Garter conferred on him by the King of England; that of St Andrew being his own; that of the Golden Fleece conferred on him by the Emperor, then King of Spain; and of St. Mic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ael, by which it appears he was a Prince very much honoured in the Wotld.</P>
<P>Also he first ordered the Thistle to be added to the Badge of the Order; and the Motto, which since is worn about it in the Royal Arms, was of his Inven∣vention (viz.) <HI>Nemo me impune Laces∣sit.</HI> The Gordon Verd, or Green Rib∣band, was then worn by the Knights Companions: But the late King James II. or (as I should say, being in Scotland) the VIIth, changed it to the Blue Rib∣band, as the Knights of the Garter wear it in England.</P>

Queen Anne, however, restored the Green Ribband again, and intended to have called a Chapter of the Order, and have brought it into its full Lustre again: But her Majesty was taken to Heaven before it could be done.</P>
<P>Lithgow is a pleasant, handsome, well built Town; the Tolbooth is a good Building, and not old, kept in good Re∣pair, and the Streets clean: The People look here as if they were busy, and had something to do; whereas in many Towns we pass'd through they seem'd as if they looked discon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olate for want of Employ∣ment, the whole Green, fronting the Lough or Lake, was covered with Lin∣nen Cloth, it being the bleaching Season, and, I believe, a Thousand Women and Children, and not less, tending and ma∣naging the bleaching Business; the Town is served with Water by one very large Bason, or Fountain, to which the Water is brought from the same Spring which served the Royal Palace.</P>
<P>From Lithgow we turned to the Right, as I said above, into the Shire of Clyds∣dale: Some Business also calling us this Way, and following the Clyde upwards, from a little above Hamilton▪ where we were before, we came to Lanerk, which is about eight Miles from it due South.</P>
<P>From Lithgow, by this Way to Lanerk, is thirty long Miles; and some of the Road over the wildest Country we had yet seen. Lanerk is the Capital indeed of the Country, otherwise it is but a ve∣ry indiferent Place; it is eminent for the assembling of the Bothwell-Bridge Rebel∣lion, and several other little Distumbances of the Whigs in those Days; for Whigs then were all Presbyterians, and Came∣ronian Presbyterians too, which, at that Time, was as much as to say Rebels.</P>
<P>A little below Lanerk the River Doug∣lass falls into the Clyde, giving the same Kind of usual Surname to the Lands about it, as I have observed other Rivers do, namely Douglassdale, as the Clyde does that of Clydsdale, the Tweed that of Tweedale; and so of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est.</P>
<P>In this dull Vale stands the antient, paternal Estate and Castle, which gives Name and (Title too) to the great Fa∣mily of Douglass. The Castle is very ill adapted to the Glory of the Family; but as it is the antient Inheritance, the Heads or Chief of the Name have always en∣deavoured to keep up the old Mansion, and have consequently, made frequent Additions to the Building, which have mame it a wild, irregular Mass; yet there are noble Apartments in it, and the House seems, at a Distance, rather a lettle Town than one whole Fabrick. The Park is very large, the Garden, or Yards, as they call them, not set out with fine Plants or Greens, or divided into Flower-Gardens, Parters, Wildernesses, Kitchin-Gardens, &amp;c. as is the modern Usage. In short, 'tis an antient, magnificent P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, great, but not gay; its Grandeur, in most Parts, consists in its Antiquity, and being the Mansion of one of the greatest Families in Scotland above 1000 Years. The History of the Family would take up a Volume by itself; and there is a Volume in Folio extant, written upon this Sub∣ject only, where the Heroes of the Name are fully set forth, and all the illustrious Actions they have been concerned in. There are, at this Time, not lets than six or seven Branches of this Family, all ranked in the Peerage of Great Britain, namely, the Duke of Douglass, the Chief of the whole Clan or Name, the Duke of Queensberry and Dover, the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of Morton, Dunbarton and March; and the Lords Mordingtoun and Forfar; the lat∣ter was lately unhappily killed at the Fight near Dumblane, against the Lord Marr and the Pretender. But I must not run out into Families; the Head Family of this Name has been in better Circum∣stances, as to Estate, than they are at present: But the young Duke does not want Merit to raise himself, when Times may come that personal Merit may be
<PB REF="499"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to raise Families, and make Men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat.</P>
<P>From Lanerk we left the wild Place <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lied Crawford Muir on the Right, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>siness that brought us round this Way <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing finished, and went away West into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Shire of Peebles, and so into Twee∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, the first Town we came to of any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore upon the Tweed, is the Town of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eebles, Capital of the Country. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own is small, and but indifferently built <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>habited, yet the high Street has some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od Houses in it.

<P>The Country is Hilly, as in the rest Tweedale, and those Hills covered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Sheep, which is, indeed, a principal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the Estates of the Gentlemen; d the Overplus Quantity of the Sheep, also their Wool, is mostly sent to Eng∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, to the irreparable Damage of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or; who, were they employed to Manu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure their own Wool, would live much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter than they do, and find the Benefit the Union in a different Manner, from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t they have yet done,</P>

<P>Here are two Monuments in this Coun∣try, all Scotland not affording the like, of the Vanity of wordly Glory. The one is in the Foundation of a Royal Pal∣ace, or Seat of a Nobleman, once the first Man in Scotland, next the King: It is a prodigious Building, too great for a Sub∣ject, begun by the Earl of Morton, whose Head being afterwards lay'd in the Dust, his Design perished; and the Building has not been cary'd on, and I suppose never will.</P>
<P>The other is in the Palace of Traquair, built and finished by the late Earl of Tra∣quair, for some Years Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, and a Person in the highest Posts, both of Honour and Profit in the Kingdom, who yet fell from it all, by the Adversity of the Times; for his Conduct under his Majesty King Chorles I being generally censur'd, and himself universal∣ly hated, he sunk into the most abject and lowest Part of human Life, even to want Bread, and to take Alms, and in that miserabe Circumstance died, and ne∣ver saw the Turn of the Times, I mean the Restoration, which happened but a Year after his Death. The House is noble, the Design great, and well finished, and no sooner done so but it was consis∣cated, and the Owner turned out of it, to seek his Bread from a Generation of his Enemies, who, thought they were mercisul enough in sparing his Life; whe∣ther it was so or not, and what his Ac∣tions were (perhaps none of the best) is not my Business; but, I think, it had been a kind of mercy to him, if they had rather taken his Head, the Condition he was reduced to, being doubtless, to a Man of any Spirit, much wor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e than Death; and, I Question whether, if he had been an English Man, he would not
<PB REF="500"/>
have put an End to the Distress he was in, <HI>Brevi Manu;</HI> Not that I think that is the Way any Christian Man ought to take to put an End to human Misery, be the Condition here what it will, but that we find the English less able to bear such Distresses than other Nations, and apter to fly into Lunacies and Desperation, that I bel eve none will dispute.</P>
<P>Bishop Burner gives an Account of this Earl as a very mean spirited, abject Per∣son, and one that suffered himself to be made the Instrument of other Mens Mis∣chiefs, and that heretofore fell to much unpit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. But be that as it will, it is as I say, a remarkable Monament of the Vanity of human Glory; and it is the more remarkable for this▪ that he was particularly drop'd and desp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed by the Party he had served and who he had too faithfully adhered to; which is a Cau∣tion to all that should come after him, to take Heed how they sacrifice themselves for Parties, and against the true Interest of their Country▪ they are sure to be abanden'd, and of those that are employ'd against.</P>
<P>Here we saw the Ruins of the once famous Abbey of Mailro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the Great∣ness of which may be a little judg'd of by its vastly extended Remains, which are of a very great Circuit: The Building is not so entirely demolish'd but that we may distinguish many Places and Parts of it from one another; as particularly the great Church or Chapel of the Mona∣stery, which is as large as some Cathe∣drass, the Choir of which is visible, and measures 140 Foot in Length, besides what may have been pull'd down at the East End; by the Thickness of the Foundations there must have been a large and strong Tower or Steeple in the Cen∣ter of the Church, but of what Form or Height, that no Guels can be made at: There are several Fragments of the House itself, and the particular Offices belonging to it; the Court, the Cloyster, and other Buildings are so visible, as that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to know it was a most magnificent in those Days.

<P>Here we made a little Excursion into England, and it was to satisfy a Curiosity of no extraordinary a Kind neither. By the sight of Chev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot Hills, which we had seen for many Miles Riding, we thought at Kelso we were very near them, and had a great Mind to take as near a View of them as we could; and taking with us an English Man, who had been very curious in the same Enquiry, and who offered to be our Guide, we set out for Wooller, a little Town lying, as it were, under the Hill.</P>
<P>Cheviot Hill or Hills are justly esteem'd the highest in this Part of England, and of Scotland also; and if I may judge, I think '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is higher a great deal than the Mountain of Mairock in Galloway, which they say is two Miles high.</P>
<P>When we came to Wooller we got an∣ther Guide to lead us to the Top of the Hills for by the Way tho' there are ma∣ny Hills and Reachings for many Miles, which are called Cheviot Hills, yet there is one Pico or Master Hill, higher than all the
<PB REF="502"/>
rest by a great deal, which, at a Distance, looks like the Pico-T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neriffe at the Ca∣naries, and is so high, that I remember it is seen plainly from the Rosemary Top in the East Riding of Yorkshire, which is near sixty Miles. We prepared to clam∣ber up this Hill on Foot, but our Guide laughed at us, and told us, we should make a long Journey of it that Way: But getting a Horse himself, told us he would find a Way for us to get up on Hor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eback; So we set out, having five or six Country Boys and young Fellows, who ran on Foot volunt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er to go with us; we thought they had only gone for their Diversion, as is frequent for Boys; but they knew well enough that we should find some Occasion to employ them and so we did, as you hall hear.</P>
<P>Our Guide led us very artfully round to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of the Hill, where it was evi∣dent, in the Winter Season, not Streams of Water, but great Rivers came pouring down from the Hill in several Channels, and those (at least some of them) very broad; they were overgrown on either B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk with Alder-Trees, so close and thick, that we rode under them, as in an Arbour. In one of these Channels we mounted the Hill▪ as the Besiegers approach a forti∣fyed Town by Trenches, and were got∣ten a great Way up, before we were well aware of it.</P>
<P>But, as we mounted, these Channels lessened gradually, till at length we had the Shelter of the Trees no longer; and now we ascended till we began to see some of the high Hills, which before we thought very lofty, lying under us, low and humble, as if they were Part of the Plain below, and yet the main Hill seem∣ed still to be but beginning, or, as if we were but entring upon it.</P>
<P>As we mounted higher we found the Hill steeper than at first, also our Horses be∣gan to complain, and draw their Haunches up heavily, so we went very softly: How∣ever, we moved and went on, till the Height began to look realty frightful, for, I must own, I wishe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my felt down again; and now we found Ule for the young Fellows that run before us; for we began to fear, if our Horses should stumble or start, we might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oll down the Hill together: and we began to ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of alighting, but our Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e called out and said, No, not yet, By and By you shall; and with that he bid the young Fellows take our Horses by the Head stalls of the Bridles, and load them. They did so, and we rode up higher still, till at length our Hearts failed us all together, and we resolved to alight; and tho' o r Guide mocked us, yet he could not pre∣vail or persuade us; so we worked it up∣on our Feer, and with labour enough, and sometimes began to talk of going no farther.</P>
<P>We were the more uneasy about mount∣ing higher, because we all had a Notion, that when we came to the Top, we should be just as upon a Pinnacle, that the Hill narrowed to a Point, and we should have only Room enough to stand, with a Fre∣cipice every way round us; and with these Apprehensions, we all sat down up∣on the Ground, and said we would go no farther.</P>
<P>Our Guide did not at first understand what we were apprehensive of; but at last by our Discourse he perceived the Mistake, and then not mocking our Fears, he told us, that indeed if it had been so, we had been in the Right, but he assured us, there was Room enough on the Top of the Hill to run a Race, if we thought sit, and we need not fear any thing of being blown off the Precipice, as we had suggested; so he Encouraging us we went on, and reach't the Top of the Hill in about half an hour more.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge I was agreeably surprized, when coming to the Top of the Hill, I saw before me a smooth, and with respect to what we expected a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st pleasant Plain, of at least half a M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le in

<P>One of our Company a good Botanist, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to searching for Simples, and, as he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found some nice Plants, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mightily pleas'd with: But as that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my way, so it is out of the pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Design. I m particular began to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at me, and to enquire what every <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was which I saw more remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t self at a Distance.</P>
<P>The Day happened to be very clear, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to ur great Satisfaction very Calm <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the hight we were upon, would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been without its Dangers.

The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is the German Ocean, was as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut just at the Foot of the Hill, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Guide pointed to shew us the Irish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: But if he could see it, knowing it particular, and where exactly to look it, it was so distant, that I could not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I was assured I saw it. We saw <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> several Hills, which he told us were England, and others in the West of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tland, but their Names were too many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us to remember, and we had no Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als there to take Minutes. We saw wick East, and the Hills called Sout<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> North, which are in sight of Edin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh. In a Word there was a surprizing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w of both the united Kingdoms, and were far from repenting the Pains we <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken.</P>
<P>Nor were we so afraid now as when first mounted the Sides of the Hill, especially we were made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of these Fears, when to our Amazment, we saw a Clergy▪man, and another Gentle∣man, and two Ladies, all on Horseback, come up to the Top of the Hill, with a Guide also as we had, and without alight∣ing at all, and only to satisfy their Curi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sity, which they did it seems. This in∣deed made us lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k upon one another with a Smile, to think how we were frighted, at our first coming up the Hill: And thus it is in most Things in Nature; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear mag∣nifies the Object, and represents Things fightful at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sight, which are presently made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y when they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> famili<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</P>
<P>Satisfied with this View, and not at all thinking our Time or Pains <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> slowed we came down the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ll by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Rout that we went up; with his Remark by the way, that wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>her on Horseback or on Foot we found it much more trouble∣some, and also tiresome to come down than to go up.</P>
<P>When we were down, our Guide car∣ryed us not to the Town of Wooller, where we were before, but to a single House, which they call Wooller Haugh∣head, and is a very good Inn, better in∣deed than we expected, or than we had met with, except at Kel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, for many Days Journey. Here we had very good Pre∣vision, very Hell Dress'd, and excellent Wine. The House is in England, but the People that kept it were Scots; yet every Thing was very well done, and we were mighty glad of the Refreshment we found there.</P>
<P>Here we enquired after the famous Sto∣ry of Cheviot Chase, which we found the People there have a true Notion of, not like what is represented in the Ball<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of Chevy-Chase, which has turn'd the whole Story into a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able: But here they told us, what all solid Histories confirm, name∣ly that it was an In road of the Earl of Douglass into England, with a Body of an Army, to ravage, burn, and plunder the Country, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was usual in these Days; and that the Earl of Northumberland,
<PB REF="504"/>
who was then a Piercy, gathering his Forces, marched with a like Army, and a great many of the Gentry and Nobility with him, to meet the Scots; and that both the Bodies meeting at the Foot of Cheviot Hills, fought a bloody Battle, wherein both the Earls were slain, fight∣ing desperately at the Head of their Troops; and so many kill'd on both Sides, that they that out-liv'd it, went off respectively neither being able to say which had the Victory.</P>
<P>They shewed us the Place of the Fight, which was on the Side of the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, if their Tradition do not n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad them, on the left hand of the Road the Ground uneven and ill enough for the Cavalry; 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up∣posed most of the Scots were Horse, and therefore 'tis said, the English Archers placed themselves on the Side of a steep Ascent, that they might not be broken in upon the Horse. They shew also two Stones which, if as I say they are not Mistaken, are on the Ground where the two Earls were slain.</P>
<P>But they shewed us the same Day, a much more famous Field of Battle than this, and that within about six or seven Miles of the same Place, namely F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oden-Field, were James IV. King of Scotland with a great Army invading England, in the Year 15<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, when the King of England was absent in his Wars abroad, at the Siege of Tournay, was met with, and sought by the Earl of Surrey, of the ancient Family of Howard, and the English Army; in which the Scots, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a very obstinate <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight were totally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and everthrown, and their King <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sighting at the Head of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was slain.</P>
<P>The River Till, which our Historians call a deep and swift River, and in which many of the Scots were drowned in the Pursuit, seemed to me not to be suffi∣cient to interrupt the slight of a routed Army, it being almost every where pas∣sable: But, perhaps, it might at that Time be swell'd with some sudden Rain, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Historirns ought to have taken No∣tice of; because the River is else so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;ma that it would seem to make us questio the rest of the Story.</P>
<P>That was such a Battle, and that th was the Place, is out of all Doubt; an the Field seems to be well of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for it is a large Plain, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank'd on th North Side, wh ch must be the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Right, and the Engl sh Left, by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Hill, and on the other S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Woods; the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Scots <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear; and the Tweed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r off.</P>

<P>The Country is good here, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Hills on both Sides; the River <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> runs in the Middle of it, keeping Course North, and the Family <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lauder, stands about the Middle of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Valley: 'Tis an ancient House, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> large; nor did it receive any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Duke Lauderdale, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> to dispose of his Fortunes another Way</P>

<P>I could not pass this Way to Edin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rgh without going off a little to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght, to see two very fine Seats, one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>longing to the Marquess of Louthian, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ancient Name of Ker, a younger <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ranch of the House of Roxburgh, at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewbattle or Newbottle. 'Tis an old <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but finely situated among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Walks and Rows of Trees, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> grown, and is particularly to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the nicest and best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Collection of Pictures of any House have seen in Scotland: The Particulars <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> too many to enter into a Description <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them. The Statues and Busts are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very fine; and there are the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of particular Families and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well of the Royal Families France and England, as of Scotland <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that are, I believe, not only in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but in any Palace in Europe.</P>
<P>Not two Miles from hence is the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House at Dalkeith, the finest and largest new-built House in Scotland; the Dutchess, Relict of the late Duke of Monmouth, has built it, as I may say, from the foundation, or as some say, upon the foundation of the old Castle of Dalkeith, which was the Estate of the Great Earl of Morton, Regent of Scot∣land, who was beheaded by King James VI. that is, of England, James I. the same that brought the Engine to behead humane Bodies from Hall fax in Yorkshire, and set it up in Scotland, and had his own Head cut off with it, the first it was try'd upon.</P>
<P>The Palace of Dalkeith is, indeed, a magnificent Building, and the inside ans∣werable to the Grandeur of the family. It stands on a rising Ground on the edge of the River E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k; the Side to the River is a Precipice, from whence it overlooks the Plain with a Majesty, like that of Windsor, on the Bank of the Thames, with necessary Allowance for the Diffe∣rence of the C untry, and of the two Rivers, which bear, indeed, no Propor∣tion. The Park is very large, and there are fine Avenues, some already made and planted, others designed, but not yet fi∣nish'd; also there are to be Water Works, <HI>Jetle D' eans,</HI> and a Canal, but these are not yet laid out; nor are the Gar∣dens finished, or the Terrasses, which will be very spacious, if done according to the Design. There are many sine Paintings especially of the Ladies of the English Court, and some Royal Originals; but we must not speak of Pictures where Newbottle is so high.</P>
<P>The Town of Dalkeith is just with∣out the Park, and is a pretty large Market Town, and the better market for being so near Edinburgh; for there comes great Quantities of Provisions hither from the the Southern Countries, which are bought up here to be carried to Edinburgh mar∣ket again, and sold there. The Town is well built, and is the better, no doubt, for the Neighbourhood of so many Noblemens
<PB REF="506" MS="y"/>
and Gentlemens Houses of such Eminence in its Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>This brought us to the very Sight of the City of Edinburgh, where we rested a few Days, having thus finished our Cir∣cuit over the whole South of Scotland, on this Side of the River Forth, and on the South Side of the Forth of Clyde So I shall conclude this Journey.</P>
<TRAILER>The <HI>END</HI> of the <HI>12</HI>th <HI>JOURNEY.</HI></TRAILER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>JOURNEY XIII.</HEAD>
<P>I AM now to enter the true and real Caledonia, for the Country on the North of the Firth is alone cal∣led by that Name, and was antient∣ly known by no other. As I shall give an Acconut of it as it is, and not as it was; so I shall describe it as I view'd it, not as other People have view'd it, nor shall I consine my self to the Division of the Country, as the Geographers have divided it, or to the Shires and Counties, as the Civil Authority has divided it; or into Presbyteries and synodical Provinces, as the Church has divided it: But noting the Shires where I find them needful, I shall give an Account of Things in the Order of my own Progress, and as I pass'd thro', or visited them.</P>
<P>I went over the Firth at the Queens-Ferry, a Place mention'd before, seven Miles West of Edinburgh; and, as he that gives an Account of the Country of Fife, must necessarily go round the Coast, the most considerable Places being to be seen on the Sea-side, or near it; so I took that Method, and began at the Queens-Ferry. A Mile from hence, or some∣thing more, is the Burrough of Inner∣keithin, an antient wall'd Town, with a spacious Harbour, opening from the East Part of the Town into the Firth of Forth; the Mouth of the Harbour has a good Depth of Water, and Ships of Burthen may ride there with Safety; but as there is not any great Trade here, and conse∣quently no Use for Shipping of Burthen, the Harbour has been much neglected: However, small Vessels may come up to the Key, such as are sufficient for their Business.</P>
<P>The Town is large, and is still popul∣ous, but decayed, as to what it has for∣merly been; yet the Market for Linnen not only remains, but is rather more con∣siderable than formerly, by reason of the Increase of that Manufacture since the Union. The Market for Provisions is also very considerable here, the Country round being very fruitful, and the Fami∣lies of Gentlemen being also numerous in the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>There was a tragical Story happened in this Town, which made it more talk∣ed of in England, at that Time, than it had been before. The Lord Butleigh (a young Nobleman, but not then come to
<PB REF="507"/>

<P>After some Time the Young Master they call the eldest Son of a Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile his Father is living) of Burleigh, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s from his Travels, and enquiring the young Woman, and being told was marryed, and to whom, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his hellish Resolution he rides away the Town, and up to the School Door, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> calling for the Schoolmaste, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Man came out to him unarm'd in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wn and Slippers; when, after asking <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was such a one, and flying out in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hard Words upon him, he drew his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol, and shot the poor Man dead upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spot, riding away in the open Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no body da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to meddle with him.</P>
<P>But Justice pursuing him, and a Pro∣mation being issued, with a Reward of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for apprehending him, he was at taken, and was tried at Edinburgh by Lord Justi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cary, and condemned to e his Head cut off, and the Day of cution appointed. Nor could all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cession of his Family and Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail with the Queen, after her Ma∣jesty had a true Account of the Fact laid before her, to pardon or reprieve him: But the Day before the Execution his Friends found Means for him to make his Escape out of the Tolbooth of Edin∣burgh, disguised, in his Sister's Clothes.</P>
<P>In Return for this Deliverance he ap∣peared in the late Rebellion, and was in the Battle of Dumblain or Sheri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>muir, but got off again; and his Estate, which, however, was but small, was forfeited among the rest. But the Murtherer is not yet brought to Justice.</P>
<P>This Tragedy, and its Circumstances, I think, merits to be recorded, and the rather, because most of the Circumstances came within the Verge of my Knowledge, and I was upon the Spot when it was done; there are many other Circumstances in it, but too long to be repeated.</P>
<P>Near Innerkeithin, a little within the Land, stands the antient Town of Dum∣fermling, as I may say, in my Lord Rochester's Words, in its full Perfection of Decay; nay, the Decay is threefold.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is a decay'd Monastery; for before the Reformation here was a very large and famous Abbey, but demolish'd at the Revolution; and saving that Part of the Church was turn'd into a Parochial Church, the rest, and greatest Part of that also lyes in Ruins, and with it the Mo∣numents of several Kings and Queens of Scotland; particularly that of Malcolm III. who founded the Mo∣nastery, as does allso the Cloister and Apartments for the religious People of the House, great Part of which are yet so plain to be seen, as to be distinguish'd one from another.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is a decay'd Court or Royal Palace of the Kings of Scotland. They do not tell us who built this Palace▪ but we may tell them who suffers it to fall down; for it is now (as it was observ'd before all the
<PB REF="508"/>
Royal Houses are) sinking into its own Ruins; the Windows are gone, the Roof fallen in, and Part of the very Walls mouldered away by the Injury of Time, and of the Times. In this Palace almost all K. James the VIth's Children were born; as particularly King Charles I. and the Princess Elizabeth, afterwards Queen of Bohemia; and their Mother, which was Queen Ann Daughter of the Queen of Denmark, made this Place her particular Residence, which was also settled upon her, as her Dower or Jointure; here the built herself an Apartment, consisting of eight Rooms over the Arch of the great Gate, which were her parti∣cular Retirement, having a Gallery reaching from that Apartment to the Royal Lodgings.</P>
<P>The Figure of the House remains, but as for the Lodgings they are all, as I have said, in their Decay, and we may now call it the Monument of a Court.</P>
<P N="3">3. Here is a decay'd Town, and we need go no farther for that Part than the Decay of the Palace, which is irrecoverable; there might be some∣thing said here of what was done at this Town, upon▪ receiving and crowning King Charles II. by the Covenanters, &amp;c. and which might, perhaps, contribute to entail a Dis∣gust upon the House, and even upon the Place; and if it did so, I fee no Reason to blame the King on that Account, for the Memory of the Place could not be pleasant to his Majesty for many Reasons: But this is Matter of History, and be∣sides, it seems to have something in it that is not, perhaps, so well to be remembered as to be forgot.</P>
<P>The Church has still a venerable Face and at a Distance seems a mighty Pile; the Building being once vastly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what is left appears too gross for present Dimensions; the Church <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they tell us, was as long as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Carlisle, design'd by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that of Glasgow, though, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> think, that at Glasgow, was design'd the Model of that at Dumfermling, the last was, by far, the most ancient</P>
<P>The People hereabout are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would be much poorer, if they had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Manufacture of Linnen for th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> port, which is here, and in most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Towns about, carry'd on with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hands than ordinary, especially for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the better Sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> The Marquess of Tweedale has a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Estate in these Parts, and is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House-keeper, or Porter of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House, and, in Effect, Lord Cham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lain.</P>
<P>From hence, turning East, we see <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Seats of private Gentlemen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Noblemen, as particularly one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the said Marquess of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Aberdour. It was formerly one of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> many noble Mansion Houses of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Earl of Morton, Regent; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Fall the Estates found new Mast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as that of Dalkeith has in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Bucclough, and this of Aberdour the House of Yester, or Tweedale. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House is old, but magnificent, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lands about it, as all must do, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the managing hands of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tweedale, have been infinitely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Planting and Enclosing.</P>

<P>He that will view the Country of Fife must, as I said before, go round the Coast; and yet there are four or five Places of Note in the Middle of the Country which are superiour to all the rest, and must not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e omitted; I'll take them as I go, though I did not travel to them in a direct Line, the names are as follow.

<P>Besides lesser Seats and Hunting houses, of which King James V. had several; and besides the several Palaces of the Earl Morton and others, which were for∣feited into the King's Hands, and which afterwards became Royal.</P>
<P>Having seen Aberdour, I took a Turn, at a Friend's invitation, to Lessly; but by the Way stopp'd at Kinross, where we had a View of two Things worth noting, 1. The famous Lake or Lough, called Lough Leven, where in an Island, stands the old Castle where Queen Mary, commonly known in England by the Name of Queen of Scots, was confin'd by the first Reform∣ers, after she had quitted, or had been forc'd to quit her Favourite Bothwel, and put herself into the Hands of her Subjects. One would have thought this Castle, standing as it were in the middle of the Sea, for so it is in its Kind, should have been sufficient to have held her, but she made shift to get out of their Hands, whether by a Silver Key, or without a Key, I believe is not fully known to this Day.</P>
<P>The Lough itself is worth seeing; 'tis very large, being above ten Miles about, and in some Places deep, famous for Fish. Formerly it had good Salmon, but now chiefly in Trouts, and other small Fish; out of it slows the River Leven, which runs from thence to Lessly.</P>
<P>At the West end of the Lake, and the Ga dens reaching down to the very Water's edge stands the most beautiful
<PB REF="510"/>
and regular Piece of Architecture, (for a private Gentlemen's Seat) in all Scotland, perhaps, in all Britain, I mean the House of Kinross. The Town lies at a little Distance from it, so as not to annoy the House, and yet so as to make it the more sociable; and at the Town is a very good Market, and the Street tolerably well built.</P>
<P>The House is a Picture, 'tis all Beauty; the Stone is white and fine, the Order re∣gular, the Contrivance elegant, the Work∣manship exquisite. Dryden's Lines, in∣tended for a Compliment on his Friend's Poetry, and quoted before, are literally of the House of Kinross.

<P>Sir William Bruce, the skilful Builder, was the Surveyor General of the Works, as we call it in England, or the Royal Architect, as in Scotland. In a Word, he was the Kit Wren of North Britain; and his Skill in the perfect Decoration of Build∣ing, has many Testimonials left upon Re∣cord for it; such as the Palace of Haly-Rood at Edinburgh; the House of Ro∣thess, and this at Kinross, besides several others.</P>
<P>The Situation of this House of Kin∣ross would be disliked by some for its be∣ing so very near the Water, and that sometimes when the Lake is swelled by Winter Rains and melted Snows, the Wa∣ter comes into, or at least unto the very Gardens; but as the Country round is dry, free from stagnated Boggs, and un∣healthy Marshes; this little mediterranean Sea gives them very little Inconveni∣ence, if any. Sir William, according to the new and laudable Method of all the Scots Gentlemen, has planted innumera∣ble Numbers of Firr-Trees upon the Estate round his House, and the present Posses∣sor Mr. Bruce, is as careful to improve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Predecessor: Posterity will find the Sweet of this Passion for planting, which is so happily spread among the People of the South parts of Scotland, and which, if it goes on, will in Time make Scot∣land a second Norway for Firt; for the Low Lands, as well as the Highlands, will be over-spread with Timber.</P>
<P>Nor may it require so many Ages some People imagine, for many of the largest and most considerable Improve∣ments are already of fifty to seventy and eighty Years standing as at Melvil, L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ly, Tester, Pinkey, Newbattle, and se∣veral other Places; and others follow apace; so that in forty or fifty Years more, as flow a growing Wood as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet there may be a Quantity of large grown Trees to be found to begin upon, so as to cut out Deal-boards in great Num∣bers, besides Sparrs, Bauks. Poles, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars &amp;c. which the Branches will supply.</P>
<P>From Kinross, I came to Lessley, where I had a full View of the Palace of Rothds, both Inside and Outside, as I had before of that of Bruce. The Magnificence of the Inside at Lessly is unusually great; but what is very particular, is the long Gallery, which is the full Length of one Side of the Building, and is fill'd w th Paintings, but especially (as at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) of the great Ancestors of the House of Rothes or Lessly at full Lengths, and in their Robes of Office or Habits of Ceremony; particularly the late Duke of Rothess, who built the House, and who was Lord High Chancellor of Scotland.</P>
<P>I do not forget that the Rooms of State at Kinross are well supplyed with Pictures and some very sine and valuable Pieces, as particularly those of King Charles I. and Henrietta Maria his Queen Daughter of France. But almost if not all the full Lengths in this Gallery of Rothess, are of the Family, and the immediate Ances∣tors from whom in a direct Line the pre∣sent Earl is descended, having been Peers,
<PB REF="511"/>
find in some or other of the greatest Of∣fices of Trust in Scotland, from the Year 1320 to 1725; so that there may well be enough to cloath a Gallery, and they are there to be distinguished by their Robes and different Habits down to the great Founder of the House, who was Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament, Lord High Treasurer, and Lord Chancel∣lor; and was created a Duke for his own Life only, so that his Successors are now but Earls: But the Family are still in the highest Esteem, and have gone thro' di∣vers Posts of Honour and Trust. The House indeed in magnificent, I cannot say the Situation is so much to Advantage as some other Seats; nor is there any large Avenue or Prospect from the Entrance, but it is a Prospect in its self; it is situat∣ed on the Banks of the Leven just where another smaller River joins it, and the Park on the South Side of the House is very beautiful, six Miles in Circumfer∣ence, walled about, and in several Parts, little Woods of Firr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trees planted with Vistas reaching to them from the House, which gives a very beautiful Prospect. The Gardens are at the East End of the House well planted, and well designed, extending to the Angle or Point, where the two Rivers meet; so that the Gardens are as it were watered on the North and on the East Side, and on the South Side are parted from the Park with a Wall; the West End of them beginning from the House.</P>
<P>This House was built for the Duke mentioned above, in the Reign of King Charles II. by that Man of Art and Mas∣ter of building Sir William Bruce mention∣ed there also, so that the Building is wholly Modern. It is a Square, and the Fronts every Way are plain, that is, with∣out Wings, and make a square Court with∣in: Here it was King James II. lodged, most part of the Time, when he was obliged by his Brother, King Charles II. to retire into Scotland while he was Duke of York; and his Apartments are marked in the House and called the Duke of York's Lodgings to this Day. They had a Com∣munication with the long Gallery, and with the great Staircase at the other End.</P>
<P>The Town of Lessly is at a small Dis∣tance West from the House or a little North-West. There is a good Market, but otherwise it is not considerable. The House is the Glory of the Place, and in∣deed of the whole Province of Fife.</P>
<P>From Lesfly, we turned away South to the Coast, and came to Bruntisland; this is a Port upon the Firth or Forth, and lies opposite to Leith, so that there is a fair Prospect as well of the Road of Leith, and the Ships riding there, as of the City and Castle of Edinburgh. There is a very good Harbour which enters as if it had been made by Hand into the Center of the Town; for the Town is as it were built round it, and the Ships lay their broad Sides to the very Houses. There is Water enough at Spring-tides, for Ships of good Burthen to come into the Basin; but at Low-Water some of the Ships lye a Ground: But want of Trade renders all this useless; for what is the best Harbour in the World without Ships? And whence should Ships be expected without a Commerce to employ them; it is true, the Ships of several other Towns on the Coast frequently put into this Har∣bour, to lay up, as we call it, and to lye by in the Winter: But this does not so much better the Town as to make it be called a Trading Town; so that, indeed, the Place is unhappy, and must decay yet farther, unless the Trade revive, which, I consess, I do not yet foresee.</P>
<P>Here is, however, a Manufacture of Linnen, as there is upon all the Coast of Fife, and especially for that they call Green-cloth, which is now in great De∣mand in England for the Printing-Trade, in the Room of Callicoes, which were lately prohibited.</P>
<P><PB REF="512"/>
Next to this is Kinghorn upon the same Coast, where, not the Sea, but the Manufacture upon the Land may be said to maintan the Place; for here is a Thread Manufacture, which they make very good, and bleach or whiten it themselves, The Women, indeed chiefly, carry on this Trade, and the Men are generally Sea∣men upon all this Coast, as high as the Queens-Ferry. Where I observed the Men carry on an odd Kind of Trade, or Sport rather (viz.) of shooting of Por∣poises, of which very great numbers are seen almost constantly in the Firth; when they catch them thus, they bring them on Shore, and boil the Fat of them as they do of Whales, into Train Oil, and the like they do with several other great Fish▪ which sometimes they have Gram∣pusses, Finn Fish, and several Species of the small Whale kind which come up there, and which they always make the best of, if they can take them. One Year in particular there came several such Fish on Shore, which they could find no Name for; there was eight or nine of them, which I saw lying on the shore of Fife, from Kinghorn to the Easter Weems, some of which were twenty Foot long and upward.</P>
<P>But this Sort of Fishing is but by Ac∣cident, and the Profit's not certain; the Firth affords a much more certain and profitable Fishery lower down, of which in its place. The Ferry, from Leith to the shore of Fife▪ is fix'd in this Town, though sometimes the Boats in Distress, and by Force of Wind and Weather, are driven to run into Brunt Island: This con∣stant Going and Coming of the Ferry-Boat, and Passengers, is asso a consider∣able Benefit to the Town of Kinghorn, and is a very great Article in its Com∣merce.</P>
<P>East of this Town is Kirkcaldy, a larger, more populous, and better built Town than the other, and indeed than any on this Coast. Its Situation is in Length, in one Street running along th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shore, from East to West, for a long Mile, and very well built, the Streets clean and well pav'e; there are some smal By Streets or Lanes, and it has some considerable Merchants in it, I mean in the true Sense of the Word Merchant. There are also several good Ships belonging to ,he Town: Also as Fife is a good Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country, her are some that deal very largely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Corn, and export great Qnan∣tities both te England and Holland Here are great of Linnen shipp'd off for Eng∣land; and as these Ships return freighted either from England or Holland, they bring all needful Supplies of foreign Goods; so that the Traders in Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kcaldy have really a very considerable Traffick, both at Home and Abroad.</P>
<P>There are several Coal-Pits here, not only in the Neighbourhood, but even close to the very Sea, at the West End of the Town, and where, one would think, the Tide should make it impossible to work them. At the East End of the Town is a convenient Yard for building and repairing of Ships, and farther East than that several Salt Pans for the boyl∣ing and making of Salt.</P>
<P>Kirkcaldy is a Member of the Royal Boroughs, as are also Bruntisland, King∣horn, and Dysert, tho' almost all of them together are not equal to this Town: So that here are no less than four Royal Boroughs in the Riding of five Miles.</P>
<P>Dysert is next, a Town that gives the Title of Noble or Baron to the Lord Dysert, who resides <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n England, tho' the Property both of the Town and the Lands adjoining belong to the Lord Sin∣clare or St Clare: But be the Estate whole it will, the Town though a Royal Burgh, is, as I said before of Dumfermling, in the full Perfection of Decay, and is, in∣deed, a most lamentable Object of a mi∣serable, dying Corporation; the only Sup∣port, which, I think, preserves the Name of a Town to it, is, that here is, in the
<PB REF="513"/>
Lands adjoining, an excellent Vein of Scots Coal, and the Lord Dysert, the Landlord, has a good Salt-work in the Town; close to the Sea there is a small Peer or Wharf for Ships, to come and load both the Salt and the Coal: And this, I think, may be said to be the whole Trade of the Town, except some Nailers and Hard-Ware Workers, and they are but few.</P>
<P>I take the Decay of all these Sea-port Towns, which 'tis evident have made a much better Figure in former Times, to be owing to the removing of the Court and Nobility of Scotland to England; for it is most certain, when the Court was at Home, they had a Confluence of Strangers, Residence of foreign Ministers, being of Armies, &amp;c. and consequently the Nobility dwelt at Home, spent the income of their Estates, and the Product of their Country among their Neighbours. The Return of their Coal and Salt, and Corn and Fish, brought them in Goods from Abroad, and, perhaps, Money; they sent their Linnen and other Goods to England, and received the Returns in Money; they made their own Manu∣factures, and though not so good and cheap as from England, yet they were cheaper to the publick Stock, because their own Poor were employed. Their Wool, which they had over and above, went to France, and return'd Ready Mo∣ney. Their Lead went to Holland, and their Cattle and Sheep to England, and brought back in that one Article above 100,000 l. Sterling per Ann.</P>
<P>Then it was the Sea port Towns had a Trade, their Court was magnificent, their Nobility built sine Houses and Pa∣laces which were richly furnish'd, and nobly finish'd within and without. They had infinitely more Value went out than came back in Goods, and therefore the Balance was evidently on their Side; whereas, now their Court is gone, their Nobility and Gentry spend their Time, and consequently their Estates in Eng∣land; the Union opens the Door to all English Manufactures, and suppresses their own, prohibits their Wool going Abroad, and yet scarcely takes it off at Home; if the Cattle goes to England, the Money is spent there too. The Troops raised there are in English Service, and Scot∣land receives no <HI>Premio</HI> for their Levies, as the might have done Abroad, and as the Swiss and other Nations do at this Time.</P>
<P>This I take to be the true State of the Case; and as this is not foreign to the Design of this Work, I am the longer upon it. I gave a particular Account in my Description of Glasgow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Dumfries, to shew you how those Places were enrich'd by the increase of their Commerce, and how the Commerce was encreased by the Union of the two King∣doms. I must likewise in Justice, demon∣strate how and why these Sea-ports, on the East, decline and decay by the same Occasion, and from the same Cause.</P>
<P>It is true, Scotland would have an ad∣vantageous Trade with England, and not the worse for the Union were not the Court remov'd, and did not their Nobility dwell Abroad, and spend their Estates Abroad: Scotland has a plentiful Product for Exportation, and were the Issue of that Product return'd and consum d at Home, Scotland would flourish and grow rich, but as it is, I may venture to say, it is not to be expected. For Ex∣ample;</P>
<P>The Product of Scotland, I say, is very considerable, I mean that Part of it which is exported to foreign Parts, for what is consumed at Home is nothing, that is to say adds nothing to the Pub∣lick Stock of the Nation, speaking of Scot∣land as a Nation by herself.</P>
<P>All the Product of Scotland which is sent Abroad, and exported to foreign Countries,
<PB REF="514"/>
and consum'd there, is so much clear Gain to the publick Stock, excepting only the Cost of its Manufacturing at Home, or curing and sending out; and except so much as is brought back in Goods of the Growth, and Manufacture of foreign Countries, and is consum'd in Scotland, which is not reckon'd as Gain, because consumed; if it is exported again, the Article goes to the Account of Publick Gain again. Now to state the Case briefly between the Exportation and Importation of Goods in Scotland, that the Difference, which is the Balance of the Trade, may appear.</P>
<P>The Product of Scotland, which it ex∣ports into foreign Countries, England in∣cluded, for I am now considering Scot∣land as if not united, is as follows.</P>

<P>And all these put together, if I am rightly informed, do not balance the Lead, Coal▪ and Salt, which they export every Year: So that the Balance of Trade must stand greatly to the Credit of the Ac∣count in the Scots Commerce.</P>
<P>And what then, would not such an annual Wealth in Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cie do for Scotland in a Year, it there was not a Gulph, in∣to which it all runs as into a Sink.</P>
<P>I know this is abundantly answered, by saying that Scotland is now establish∣ed in a lasting Tranquillity; the Wars be∣tween the Nations are at an End, the Wastings and Plunderings, the Ravages and Blood are all over; the Lands in Scotland will now be improved, their Estates doubled, the Charges of defend∣ing her Abroad and at Home lies upon England; the Taxes are easy and ascer∣tained, and the West India Trade <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pours in Wealth upon her; and this is all true; and, in the End, I am still of Opinion Scotland will be Gamer: But I must add that her own Nobility, would they be true Patriots, should then put their helping Hand to the rising Ad∣vantages of their own Country, and spend some of the large Sums they get in Eng∣land in applying to the Improvement of their Country, erecting Manufactures, em∣ploying the Poor, and propagating the Trade at Home, which they may <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee plainly has made their united Neighbours of England so rich.</P>
<P>Why might not the Wooll, which hey send to England, be manufactur'd in Scot∣land? If they say they know not how to make the Goods, or how to dispose of them when made, my Answer is short; I know 'tis not the Work of Gentlemen to turn Manufacturers and Mercha ts: And I know also a Number of Projectors, that is to say, Thieves and Cheats, have teas'd and hang'd about them to draw them into Manufacturing only to bubble them of their Wooll and Mo∣ney.</P>
<P><PB REF="516"/>
But here is a plain Scheme, let the Scots Gentlemen put their Stewards to Work to employ the poor People to spin the Wool into Yarn, and send the Yarn into England; 'tis an easy Manufacture, and what the Scots are very handy at, and this could never be difficult. They may have Patterns of the Yarn given them here, a Price agreed on, and good Security for payment: This can have no Difficulty; the Irish are fallen into this Way, to such a Degree, that 40000 Packs of Wool and Worsted Yarn are brought into England now every Year, and sold here, where, about thirty Years ago, not a Pound of it was imported ready spun.</P>
<P>This, and many such Advantages in Trade, Scotland might find in her own Bounds, her Gentlemen assisting the Poor only with their Stocks of Wool; by which Means the Poverty and Sloth of the meaner People would be remov'd, and Scotland enrich'd: But I have done my Part, and have not Room to enlarge: Na∣ture will dictate enough to the Gentle∣men to go work upon it, if they have any Design to do their Country Good, and if a narrow and selfish Spirit does not continue to prevail among them.</P>
<P>The decay'd Burghs being pass'd, we came to a Village called the Weems, or by Way of Distinction, the Wester Weems, or Wemys. This is a small Town, and no Borough, belonging to the Earl of Weemys, whose House stands a little farther East, on the Top of a high Cliff, looking down upon the Sea, as Dover Castle looks down upon the Strait, be∣tween it and Calais, tho' not so high.</P>
<P>The Account given lately of this no∣ble Castle of the Weemys is very Ro∣mantick, and must necessarily be laugh'd at by the Family itself who know the House. It is a very good House, and has one large Front to the Sea, but with∣out any Windsor-like Terrass between the House and it, as is represented. At the West End, upon the same Cliff, is a small Plain, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Bowling. Green, and where the late Earl, being Admiral, had some small Field-Piece planted to answer Salutes Behind the House is a small and irregular Court Yard, with two Wings of Building, be∣ing Offices to the House on one Side, and Stables on the other. Nor is there any Gardens, or Room for any, much less a spacious Park, on the North side of the House; but the Road from the Wester Weemys to the Easter passing between, there is a large, well planted Orchard, and it is no other, nor other∣wise intended; and as to a spacions Park there is nothing like.

<P>Here we saw the shore of the Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> covered with Shrimps, like the ground covered with a thin Snow; and as you rode among them they would ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Kind of Dust, being scar'd by the Footing of the Horse, and hopping like Grass hoppers.</P>

<P>Beyond this is the Methuel, a little Town, but a very safe and good Har∣bour, firmly built of Stone, almost like the Cobb at Lime, though not wholly projecting into the Sea, but standing with∣in the Land, and built out with two Heads and Walls of thick strong Stone, it stands a little on the West side of the Mouth of the River Leven; the Salmon of this River are esteemed the best in this Part of Scotland.</P>
<P>Here my Lord Weemys brings his Coal, which he digs above two Miles off, on the Banks of the River Leven, and here it is sold or shipp'd off; as also what Salt he can make, which is not a great deal. Nor is the Estate his Lordship makes from the said Coal-Works equal to what it has been, the Water having, after an immense Charge to throw it off, broken in upon the Weeds, and hinder'd their going on, at least to any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Advantage.</P>

<P>Over egainst this Shore, and in the Mouth of the Forth, opposite to the Isle of the Bass, lyes the Isle of May, known to Mariners by having a Light-House upon it; the only constant inhabitant, is said to be the Man maintain'd there by the Government to take care of the Fire in the Light-House.</P>
<P>Here (you may observe) the French Fleet lay with some Assistance, when the P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etender was on Board: And here the English Four a Clock Gun, on Board their approaching Squadron, unhappily gave the Alarm; so that they immediately weigh'd, got under Sail, and made the best of their Way, the English pursuing them in vain, sxcept only that they took the Salisbury, which was a considerable Way behind the Fleet, and could not come up with the rest; the Story is well known; so I need not repeat it.</P>
<P>The Shore of the Firth or Frith ends here, und the Estuarium or Mouth open∣ing, the Land of Fife falls off to the North, making a Promontory of Land, which the Seamen call Fife-Ness, look∣ing East to the German Ocean, after which the Coast Trends away North, and the first Town we saw there was St. Andrew's, an ancient City, the Seat of an Archbishop, and an University.</P>
<P>As you must expect a great deel of An∣tiquity in this Country of Fife, so you must expect to find all those antient Pieces murning their own Decay, and drooping and sinking in Ashes.</P>

whom he caused to be burnt in the Parade of the Castle, he himself, sitting in his Balcony to feed and glut his Eyes with the Sight of it.</P>
<P>The old Church here was a noble Structure; it was longer than St. Paul's in London by a considerable Deal, I think, by six Yards, or by twenty five Foot. This Building is now sunk into a simple Parish Church, though there are many plain Discoveries of what it has been, and a great deal of Project and Fancy may be employed to find out the antient Shape of it.</P>
<P>The City is not large, nor is is con∣temptibly small; there are some very good Buildings in it, and the Remains of ma∣ny more: The Colleges are handsome Buildings, and well supplyed with Men of Learning in all Sciences, and, who go∣vern the Youth they instruct with Reputa∣tion; the Students wear Gowns here of a Scarlet-like Colour, but not in Grain, and are very numerous: The University is very antient as well as the City; the Foundation was settled, and the publick Buildings appointed in the Beginning of the fifteenth Century by King James I. 'Tis true, they tell us here were private Schools set up many Ages before that, even as far back as 937; but I see no Evidence of the Fact, and so do not pro∣pose it for your Belief, though 'tis very likely there was some Beginnings made before the King came to encourage them, so far as to form an University.</P>
<P>There are three Colleges in all; the most antient, and which, they say, was the Publick School so long before, is cal∣led St. Salvadote. How it was made to speak Portuguese, I know not, unless it might be that some Portuguese Clergy∣men came over hither as the first Profes∣sors or Teachers; in English it is St. Sa∣viom's, in Spanish it would be called Nostra Seigniora, or our Lord; and so St. Maros would be called Nostra Dame de St. Andrew, or our Lady of St. Andrew's. This College of St. Mary's is called the New College, and the Middlemost, (for Age) is called St. Leonard's College.</P>
<P>The old College as I have said, though it was a School, as they affirm, above 200 Years before, was turned into a Col∣lege, or founded as such by James Ken∣nedy, the Son of the Lord Kennedy, by Mary, Daughter of King Robert III. This James Kennedy was a Clergyman of great Fame in those Days, and rose by the Re∣putation of his Wisdom, Prudence, and Beneficence to all Mankind, to the high∣est Posts of Honour in the State and Dig∣nity in the Church; for he was Lord Chancellor of Scotland under James II. and Archbishop of this See of St. Andrew's. He was a great Lover of Learning, and of learned Men; and was the first who encouraged Men of Learning from Abroad, to come there and take upon them the governing and instructing the Youth in the great School, which, as I say, above, had been there so long, as that it was then called the antient School of St. An∣drew. These learned Men put him upon founding and endowing a College, or rather turning the School into a College or Academy, which he did.</P>
<P>The Building is antient, but appears to have been very magnificent considering the Times it was erected in, which was 1456. The Gate is large, and has hand∣some Spire over it all of Stone. In the first Court, on the Right Side as you go in, is the Chapel of the College, not ex∣traordinary large, but sufficient. There is an antient Monument of the Archbi∣shop the Founder, who lyes buried in the Church of his own Building. Beyond the Chapel is the Cloister, after the antient Manner, not unlike that in Canterbury, but not so large. Opposite to this are Offices, and proper Buildings for the ne∣cessary Use of the Colleges. In the second Court are the Schools of the Col∣lege, on the same Spot where stood the antient Grammar School, mentioned above,
<PB REF="521"/>
above, if that Part is to be depended up∣on Over these Schools is a very large Hall for the Publick Exercises, as is usual in other Universities; but this is a most spacious Building, and far larger than there is any Occasion for.</P>
<P>In the some Court are the Aparments for the Masters, Professors, and Regents, which, (as our Fellows) are in Sallary, and are Tutors and Governors to the se∣veral Students; were this College support∣ed by additional Bounties and Donations, as has been the Case in England; and were sufficient Funds appointed to repair and keep up the Buildings, there would few Colleges in England go beyond it for Magnificence: But Want of this, and o∣ther Encouragements, causes the whole Building to seem as if it was its declining State, and looking into its Grave: The Truth is, the College wants nothing but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Fund to be honestly applyed for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Repair of the Building▪ finishing the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Design, and encouraging the Scholars. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. Skeen, Principal of this College, shew∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Way to Posterity to do this, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id out great Sums in Repairs, especially <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Churches, and founded a Library <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Use of the House.</P>
<P>They tell you a Story here of nine <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found under the Archbishop's Tomb, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Restoration of King Charles II. to me the Story does not tell well at First, It does not appear of what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or to what Purpose so many Maces <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made and kept there, the like not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> known to be us'd in any Cathedral <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollege in other Countries: And in the Place how came they to rummage good Founder's Grave, and that in Charles the IId's Time too; if it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een in Oliver Cromwell's Domina∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it would have seemed rational to ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t; but after the Restoration to the Monuments of the Dead, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing extraordinary: But be that as it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ere are three Maces kept in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whether they were found in the King's Tomb or not, that I leave to Tradition, as I fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it. One of these Maces is of very fine Workmanship, all of Silver, gilt, and very heavy, of fine Imagery, and curious Workmans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip, made at Parts by the Archbishop's special Di∣rections, as appears by an Inscription on a Plate, fastened to the Mace by a little Chain, and preserved with it.</P>
<P>The Story of St. Andrew, and of his Bones being buried here: of the first Stone of the Cathedral Church being laid upon one of St. Andrew's Legs or Thig-Bone, and of those Bones being brought from Patras in the Morea, near the Gulph of Lepanto; these Things are too antient, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to much of the Legend for me to meddle with.</P>
<P>In the second College, which is called St Leonard's▪ is a Principal, who must be a Doctor of Divinity by the Foundation; but the present Church Government in∣sisting upon the Parity of the Clergy, are pleased to dispense with that Part: There are also four Prosessors of Philosophy, to whom the late Sir John Scot, a bountiful Benefactor to this College, has added a Professor of Philology, and has settled a very handsome Stipend upon the Profes∣sor: Also the same Gentleman augmented the College Library with several valuable Books to a very considerable Sum. And since that Sir John Wedderburn, a Gentle∣man of a very antient Family, and a great Lover of Learning, has given a whole Library, being a great and choice Collec∣tion of Books, to be added to the Library of this College.</P>
<P>The Revenue of this College is larger than that of the old College; it has also more Students. It was founded and en∣dowed by the Earl of Lenox, being before that a religious House, of the Order of St. Benedict, as appears by the Register and Charter of the Foundation</P>
<P>It is not so large and magnificent as St. Salvador originally was; but 'ts kept in much better Repair. It has but one Court
<PB REF="522"/>
or Square, but it is very large. The old Building of the Monastery remains entire, and makes the South side, and the old Cells of the Monks makes now the Chambers for the Students: The Chapel takes up the North side, and a large side of more Modern Apartments on the West, which are nevertheless old enough to be falling down; but they are now repairing them, and adding a great Pile of Building to compleat the Square, and join that side to the North where the Chapel stands.</P>
<P>This College has large Yards, as they call them, that is to say Gardens, or ra∣ther Orchards, well planted, and good Walks in them as well as good F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t.</P>
<P>This College has many Benefactors, which make it flourish much beyond the first; and they talk of a large Gift yet to come from a noble Family, which, if it falls, will enable them to put the whole House in compleat Repair.</P>
<P>The New College, called St. Mary's, was founded by Cardinal Beaton, Arch∣bishop of St. Andrew's, and is very sin∣gular in its reserv'd and limited Laws. Here ate no Scholars at all; but all those Scholars who have pass'd their first Studies, and gone through a Course of Philoso∣phy in any of the other Colleges, may enter themselves here to study Hebrew and the Mathematicks, History, or other Parts of Science.</P>
<P>It was in this College King Charles I. held a Parliament; the Place is called the Parliament Room to this Day, and is a very large, spacious Room, able to receive 4000 People, placed on Seats to sit down; the Form is reserv'd very plain, and the Place, where the Tables for the Clarks and other Offices were set, is to be seen.</P>
<P>There is a Library also to this College, but not very valuable, or so well furnish'd as that of St. Leonard's. Here are, how∣ever, two Professors of Divinity; one is called the principal Professor of Theo∣logy, and the other barely the Prose <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or of Theology: To these was afterwards added a Professor of the Mathematicks; and he that was the first who enjoyed the Place, viz. Dr. Gregory, obtained an Observatory to be erected, and gave them abundance of Mathematical and Astrono∣mical instruments: But it is not now made Use of, for what Reason I kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w not.</P>
<P>In the New Church in this City lies the Body of the late Archbishop Sharp, who was Assassinated upon a Moor or Heath, as he was coming in his Coach home to this City from the Court. There is a fine Monument of Marble over his Grave, with his Statue kneeling on the upper Part, and the Manner of his Mur∣der is cut in Bass Relief below. This Murder is Matter of History, but is so foolishly, or so partial<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, or so imperfect∣ly related by all that have yet written of it, that Posterity will loose both the Fact and the Cause of it in a few Years more. It would require too large a space in this Work to give a fresh and impartial Ac∣count of it, and for that Reason I cannot enter upon it, though I have the most exact Account that, I believe, is left in the World, which I had from the Mouth of one of the Actors, and have since had it confirmed from several others, thoroughly acquainted with the Particu∣lars of it</P>
<P>I shall only say here, that the Arch∣bishop had been a furious and merciless Persecutor, and, indeed, Murderer of ma∣ny of the innocent People, merely for their keeping up their Field-Meetings, and was charg'd in particular with two Ac∣tions; which, if true will, though not justify, yet take off much of the black Part, which the very Murder itself leaves on the Memory of the Actors.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Keeping back the Reprieve, which was sent down by K. Charles the 2d's express Order, and which
<PB REF="523"/>
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> received for stopping the Evecusion of twelve Fer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, under Sentence of Death; I say keep∣ing it back in his Pocket <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll they were executed. I know Bishop Bur∣net charges this upon another Hand; but these Men were assur'd the Arch∣bishop was the Man, perhaps, the other might be consenting.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Shipping 200 poor Men on board a Vessel, on pretence of Tran∣sportation to the English Colonies in the West Indies; but ordering the Ship to be run on shore and lost. I say it is said to be ordered, and generally so believed, because, when the Ship was bulg'd upon the Rocks, the Master and Seamen, and the Officers, appointed to confine the banish'd People, all got on Shore, bat lock'd all the rest down under the Hatch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and would not suffer one of them to come out, by which Means they every one perish'd.</P>
<P>These two Things they charg'd di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ectly on the Archbishop, besides many other Cruelties, which they call Murders; and if they were acted, as is related by others as well as they, I must acknow∣ledge they could be no other.</P>
<P>Now 'tis as certain that these Men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing of meeting with the Arch-Bishop at that Time; but being them∣selves Out▪law'd Men, whom any Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at met might kill, and who (it taken) <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have been put to Death: They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lways went arm'd▪ and were, at that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne, looking for another Man, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nexpectedly they saw the Bishop <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards them in his Coach, when one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them says to the other, we have not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Person we look'd for; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s delivered our Enemy, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>derer of our Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hren into our Hands, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainst whom we cannot obtain Justice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Law, which is perverted: But member the Words of the Text, <HI>Is ye let him go, thy Life shall be required for his Life.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, they immediately resolv'd to fall upon him, and cut him in Pieces; I say they resolved, all but one, (viz.) Hackston of Rathellet, who was not wil∣ling to have his Hand in the Blood, though he acknowledg'd he deserv'd to die: So that when they attack'd the Bishop. Hack∣ston went off, and stood at a Distance▪ Nor did he hold their Horses, as one has ignorantly publish'd; for they at∣tack'd him all mounted, nor could they well have stopp'd a Coach and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix Hoa∣ses, if they had been on Foot. I men∣tion this Part, because, however Provi∣dence order'd it, so it was, that none of the Murderers ever fell into the hands of Justice, but this Hackston of Rathellet, who was most cruelly tortur'd, and af∣terwards had his hands cut off, and was then executed at Edinburgh.</P>
<P>I have not Time to give the rest of this Story, though the Particulars are very well worth relating, but it is re∣mote from my Purpose, and I must pro∣ceed The City of St. Andrew's is, nor∣withstanding its many Disasteis; such as th Ruin of the great Church▪ the demo∣lishing its Castle, and the Archbishop's Palace, and Oliver Cromwel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Citadel; yet, I say, it is still a handsome City, and well built, the Streets straight and large, being three Streets paralled to one another, all opening to the Sea.</P>
<P>They shew among other Remains of Antiquity, the Apartments of the Palace Cardinal Beaton stood, or fat in State to see the Martyrdom of Mr. Wishart, who, at the Stake, call'd aloud to him, and cited him to appear at the Bar of God's Justice within such a certain Time, within which Tima he was mur∣dered by the famous Norman Lessly, thrown into the Square, of the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, and his Body dragged to the very
<PB REF="524"/>
Act of Parlament in England, for the supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>effing the Use and Wearing of print∣ed Callicoes, so that the Manufacture is greatly increased here, especially of that Kind of Cloth which they buy here and send to England to be Printed and which is so much us'd in England in the Room of the Callicoes, that the Worsted and Silk Weavers in London seem to have ve∣ry little Benefit by the Bill, but that the Linnen of Scotland and Ireland are, as it were, constituted in the Room of the Callicoes.</P>
<P>From Perth I went South to that Part of the Province of Fife, which they call Clackmanan, lying West from Dumferm∣ling, and extending itself towards Ster∣ling and Dumblain, all which Part I had not gone over before, and which was an∣tiently accounted to be Part of Fife.</P>
<P>From Perth to Sterling there lyes a Vale which they call Strathmore, and which is a fine level Country, though sur∣rounded with Hills, and is esteem'd the most fruitful in Corn of all that Part of the Country: It lies extended on both Sides the Tay, and is said to reach o B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>echen North East, and almost to Ster∣ling South West. Here are, as in all such pleasant Soils you will find, a great many Gentlemen's Seats; though on the North Side of the Tay, and here in parti∣cular is the noble Palace of Glames, the Hereditary Seat of the Family of Lyon, Earls of Strathmore; and as the Heir in Reversion now enjoys the Title and Estate, so it very narrowly escap d being forfeited; for the elder Brother Earl of Strathmore, having entertein'd the Pre∣tender magnificently in this fine Palace, and join'd his forces in Person, and with all his Interest, lost his Life in that Ser∣vice, being kill'd at the Battle of Sheriff-Moor, by his fall, the Estate being en∣tail'd, descended to the second Son, or younger Brother, who is now Earl of Strathmore▪</P>
<P>Glames is, indeed, one of the finest old built Palaces in Scotland, and by far the largest; and this makes me speak of it here, because I am naming the Pre∣tender and his Affairs, though a little out of Place; when you see it at a Distance is so full of Turtets and lofty Buildings, Spires and Towers▪ some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ain others shining with gilded Tops, that it looks not like a Town, but a City; lard the nFble Appearance seen through <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vista's of the Park are so differing, that it does not appear like the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any two Ways together.</P>
<P>The great Aveuue is a full halt Mile, planted, on either side with several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Trees; when you come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Gate you are surprized with the Beauty and the Variety of the Statues, Busts, some of Brass, some gilded, some plain. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he Statues in Brass are four, one of King James VI. one of King Charles I. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and spurr'd, as if going to take <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the head of his Army; one of Charles II. and one of King James VII after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Pattern of that at Whitehall.</P>
<P>When the Pretender lodg'd here, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Earl of Strathmore entertained him in his first Passage to Perth with great Magnificence: There were told three and forty furnish'd Rooms on the first Floor of the Aouse; fome Beds, perhaps, were put up for the Occasion, for they m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de Eighty-eight Beds for them, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Retinue of the Pretender was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the House being able to receive the Coat of a real reigning Prince,</P>

<P>From hence I came away South West, and crossing the Tay below Perth, but above Dundee, came to Dumblain, a Name made famous by the late Battle fought between the Army of King George, un∣der the Command of the Duke of Argyle, and the Pretender's Forces under the Earl of Marr, which was fought on Sheriff-Moor, between Sterling and Dumblain: The Town is pleasantly situated, and to∣lerably well built, but out of all Man∣ner of Trade; so that there is neither present Prosperity upon it, or Prospect of future.</P>
<P>Going from hence we took a full View of the Field of Battle, call'd Sheriff-Mui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and had Time to contemplate how it was possible, that a Rabble of Highland∣ers, arm'd in haste▪ appearing in Rebel∣lion, headed by a Person never in Arms before, nor of the least Experience, should come so near to the overthrowing an Army of regular disciplin'd Troops, and led on by experinced Officers, and so great a General: But when the Mistake appear'd also, we bless'd the good Protec∣tor of Great Britain, who, under a Piece of the Mistaken Conduct in the World, to say no worse of it, gave that impor∣tant Victory to King George's Troops, and prevented the Ruin of Scotland from an Army of Highlanders.</P>
<P>From this Place of Reflection I came forward in Sight of Sterling Bridge, but leaving it on the Right Hand, turn'd away East to Alloway, where the Earl of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r has a noble Seat, I should have said had a noble Seat, and where the Navigation of the Firth of Forth begins. This is, as I hinted before, within four Miles of Sterling by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>carcely within twenty by Water, occasion'd by those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncommon Meanders and Reaches in the River, which gives so beautiful a Pros∣pect from the Castle of Sterling.</P>
<P>This fine Seat was formerly call'd the Ca∣stle of Alloway, but is now so beautify'd, the Buildings, and especially the Gardens, so compleat and completely modern, that no appearance of a Castle can be said to remain▪ There is a Harbour for Shipping, and Ships of Burthen may come safely up to it: And this is the Place where the Glas∣gow Merchants are, as I am told, erecting Magazines or Warehouses, to which they propose to bring their Tobacco and Sugars by Land, and then to ship them for Hol∣land or Hamburgh, or the Baltick, or England, as they find Opportuni y, or a Market; and I doubt not but they will find thetr Advantage in it.</P>
<P>The Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deus of Alloway House, in∣deed▪ well deserve a Description; they are by much, the finest in Scotland, and not outdone by many in England; the Gardens, singly describ'd, take up above forty Acres of Ground, and the adjoin∣ing Wood, which is adapted to the House in Avenues and Vista's, above three times as much.</P>
<P>It would be lessening the Place to at∣tem the Description, unless I had Room to do it compleatly; 'tis enough to lay it requires a Book, not a Page or two: There is, in a Word, every Thing that Nature and Art can do, brought to Per∣fection.</P>
<P>The Town is pleasant, well built, and full of Trade; for the whole Country has some Business or other with them, and they have a better Navigation than most of the Towns on the Firth, for a Ship of Three Hundred Ton may lye allo at the very Wharf; so that at Al∣loway a Merchant may trade to all Parts of the World, as well as at Leith or at Glasgow.</P>
<P>The High Street of Alloway reaches down to this Harbour, and is a very spacious

well built Streets, with Rows of Trees finely planted all the Way. Here are several Testimonies of the Goodness of their Trade, as particularly a lage Deal-Yard, or Place for laying up all Sorts of Norway Goods, which shews they have a Commerce thither. The have large Warehouses of Naval Stores; such as Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, two Saw Mills for cutting or slitting of Deals, and a Rope-Walk for making all Sorts of Ropes and Cables for Rigging and fitting of Ships, with several other Things, which con∣vinces us they are no Strangers to other Trad s, as well by Sea as by Land.</P>
<P>It is a strange Testimony of the Power of Envy and Ambition, that Mankind, bless'd with such Advantages, for an easy and happy Retreat in the World, should hazard it all in Faction and Party, and throw it all away in View, and even with∣out a View of getting more: But I must not phylosopihze, any more than launch out into other Excesses; my Business is with the present State of the Place, and to that I confine myself as near as I can</P>
<P>From Alloway, East, the Country is called the Shire of Clackmannan, and is known for yielding the best of Coal, and the greatest Quantity of it of any Coun∣try in Scotland; so that it is carryed, not to Edinburgh only, but to England, to Holland, and to France; and they tell us of new Pits, or Mines of of Coal now discover'd, which will yield such Quanti∣ties, and so easy to come at, as are never to be exhausted; tho' such great Quan∣tities should be sent to England, as the York Buildings Company boast of, name∣ly, twenty Thousand Ton a Year; which, hower, I take it as it is, for a Boast, or or rather a Pretence to persuade the World they have a Demand for such a Quantity; whereas, while the Freight from Scotland is, as we know, so dear, and the Tax in England continues so heavy, the Price of these Coals will always be so high at Lon∣don, as will not fail to restrain the Con∣sumption; nor is it the Interest of Scot∣land to send away so great a Quantity of Coal as shall either make a Scarcity, or raise the Price of them at Home.</P>
<P>On this Shore of the Firth, farther down, stands the Town Culross a neat and agreeable Town, lying in length by the Water Side, like Kirkcaldy, and be∣ing likewise a Trading Town, as Trade must be understood in Scotland. Here is a pretty Market, a plentiful Country be∣hind it, and the navigable Firth before it; the Coal and the Linnen Manufacture, and Plenty of Corn▪ such Exportations will always keep something of Trade a∣live upon this whole Coast.</P>
<P>Here is a very noble Seat belonging to the Bruces, Earls of Kincairn, and is worth Description; but that I have named so many fine Houses, and have yet so many to go over before I go through the whole Tour of Scotland, that it is impossible to give every fine House a Place here, nor would it do any thing but t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Reader, rather than inform him; as I have done therefore in England I must be content to name them, unless I should make my Jour∣ney a meer Visit to great Houses, as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Scotland had nothing else worth No∣tice.</P>
<P>This Calling at Culross, called vulgar∣ly Cooris, finishes my Observations upon the Province of Fife. They told me of Mines of Copper, and of Lead, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discover'd in Fise, and of Silver also. But I could not learn that any of them were actually wrought, or, as they ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it in Darbyshire, at work. It is, how∣ever, not improbable but that there are such Mines, the Country seeming very likely for it by many Particular Tokens.</P>
<P>The two Lomons in this Province are two remarkable Mountains, which parti∣cularly seem to promise Metal in their Bowels, if they were thoroughly search'd. They rise up like two Sugar-Loaves in the Middle of a plain Country, not far f om Falkland, and give a View of the Firth of

<P>Having made this little Excursion to the South from Perth, you may suppose me now returned Northward again; and having given you my Account of Perth, and its present Circumstances, I now pro∣ceed that Way, taking Things as well in their ordinary Situation as I can; we could not be at Perth and not have a De∣si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to see that antient Seat of Royal Ce∣remony, for the Scots Kings, I mean of Scone, where all the Kings of Scotland were crowned.</P>
<P>Scone lyes on the other Side of the Tay, about a Mile North West from Perth; it was famous for the old Chair in which the Kings of Scotland were crown'd, and which Edw. I. King of England, having pierced through the whole Kingdom, and nothing being able to withstand him, brought away with him. It is now de∣posited in Westminster▪ and the Kings of Scotland are still crowned in it, according to an old Scots Prophecy, which they say, Mark it. I do but tell you They say so, was cut in Stone, which is enclosed in the lower Parth of the wooden Chair in which the Kings are crown'd.</P>

<P>Englished thus;
<Q><L>Or Fates deceived, and Heaven de∣crees in vain,</L>
<L>Or where this Stone is found, the Scots shall reign.</L></Q></P>
<P>This Palace was in those Days a great Monastery, and famous on Occasion of this S one in the Chair; the Monks ap∣propria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to themselves not the Custom only, but the Right of having all the Kings crowned on it, as if it had been a sacred Right, and instituted in Heaven: and that the Kings would not prosper if they were crowned any where else.</P>
<P>Process of Time rais'd it from a Mona∣stery to a Royal Palace, in Honour of the Ceremony, and of King Kenneth, who, having fought a bloody Battle there with the Picts, and given them a great Over∣throw, sat down to rest him upon this Stone, after he had been tired with the Slaughter of the Enemy, upon which his Nobles came round about h m to congra∣tulate his Success▪ and, in Honour to his Valour, crowned him with a Garland of Victory; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter which he dedicated the Stone to the Ceremony, and appointed, that all the Kings of Scotland should be crowned, sitting upon it as he had done▪ and that then they should be victorious over all their Enemies.</P>
<P>But enough of Fable▪ for this, I sup∣pose, to be no other; yet, be it how it will, this is no Fable, that here all the Kings of Scotland were Crown'd and all the Kingi have been since crowned on it, or in the Chair, or near it ever since.</P>
<P>The Palace of Scoon, though antient, is not so much decayed as those I have al¦ready spoken of; and the Pretender found it very well in Repair for his Use: Here he lived and kept his Court, a fatal Court to the Nobility and Gentry of Scotland, who were deluded to appear for him; here I say, he kept his Court in all the State and Appearance of a Sovereign, and re∣ceived Honours as such; so that he might say he reign'd in Scotland, though not over Scotland, for a few Days: But it was but a few (about twenty) till he and all his Adherents were oblig'd to quit, not the Place only, but the Island▪ and that without fighting, though the Roy∣al Army was not above Ten Thousand Men.</P>
<P>The Building is very large, the Front above 200 Foot in Breadth, and has two ex raordinary fine square Courts, besides
<PB REF="530"/>
others, which contain the Offices, Out∣houses, &amp;c. The Royal Apartments are spacious and large, but the Building the Wainscotting, the Chimney-Pieces, &amp;c. all after the old Fashion.</P>
<P>Among the Pictures there, the Pre∣tender had the satisfaction to see his Mother's Picture, an Original, done in Italy, when she was Princess of Modena only, and was marry'd by Proxy, in the Name of King James VII then Duke of York, represented by the Earl of Peter∣borough Here is the longest Gallery in Scotland, and the Cieling Painted, but the Painting exceeding old.</P>
<P>From Scoon to Dunkel is so little a Way we desired to see it, being the Place where the first Skirmish was fought be∣tween the Forces of King William, af∣ter the Revolution, and the Laird of Claverhouse, after called Viscount Dun∣dee, and where the brave Lieutenant-Colonel Cleeland was kill'd: But Dundee's Men, tho' 5000, were gallantly repuls'd by a Handful, even of new rais'd Men.</P>
<P>The Duke of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hol has an old House, here, and it was in one of the Courts of that House that Part of the Action was; and the Gentleman above-named was shot from out of a Window, as he was ordering and encouraging his Men; we were almost tempted to go on this Way▪ to see the Field of Battle, be∣tween the same Dundee and the great Lieutenant General Mac-Kay, wherein the latter, though with regular Troops, was really defeated by the Highlanders: But Dundee being kill'd by an acciden∣tal Shot after the Fight, they could not improve the Victory, and the Resistance ended soon after; whereas, indeed, had not that Accident happened, Dundee, who was a bold enterprising Man, had cer∣tainly march'd Southward, and bid fair to have given King William a Journey into the North, instead of a Voyage to Ireland; but Providence had better Things in store for Great Britain.</P>
<P>But our determin'd Rout lay up the Eastern Shore, and through the Sh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res, adjacent on that side, as particularly An∣gus, Mearns, Marr, Aberdeen, Buchan or Bucquhan, &amp;c. So as I laid out before to Inverness.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden tells us, that the Firth of Tay was the utmost Bounds of the Roman Empire in Britain. That Julius Agricola, the best of Generals under the worst of Emperor's, Domitian, though he pierc'd farther, and travers'd by Laud into the Heart of the Highlands, yet see∣ing no End of the barbarou▪Country, and no Advantage by the Conquest of a few Barbarian Mountaineers, withdrew and fix'd the Roman Eagles here; that he frequently harrass'd the Picts by Excur∣sions and Inroads, and destroy'd the Coun∣try, laying it waste, to starve them out of the fertilest Part of it, but always re∣turn'd to his Post, making the Tay his Frontier.</P>
<P>But our English Caesars have outgone the Romans; for Edward I. as is said, pass'd the Tay, for he rifled the Abb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y at Scoon; and, if we may believe Hi∣story, penetrated into the remotest Parts, which, however, I take to be only the remotest Parts of what was then known to the English; for as to the Highlands, the Mountains of Loquhaber, Boss, Mur∣ray, Sutherland, and Caithness, we read nothing of them: And from these Re∣treats the Scots always return'd, Antaeus like, with double Strength after every Defeat, till in the next Reign they over∣threw his Successor Edward II. at Ban∣nockbourn, and drove the English out of the whole Country; nay, and follow'd them over Tweed into England, ravag∣ing the Countries of Northumberland and Cumberland, and paying them in the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> own kind with Interest.</P>
<P>Oliver Cromwell indeed (according to the Motto of a noble House in Scot∣land, (viz) Ride Through) Rode Through; he penettated to the remotest Part of▪
<PB REF="531"/>
the Island, and that he might rule them with a Rod of Iron in the very Letter of it, he built Citadels and Forts in all the Angeli and Extremes, where he found it needful to place his stationary Legions, just as the Romans did; as at Leith, at St. Andrews, at Inverness, Irwin, Inner∣lochy, and several other Places: And just now we find King George's Forces marching to the remotest Corners, nay, ferrying over into the Western, and North-Western Islands; but then this is not as a Foreigner and Conqueror, but as a So∣vereign, a lawful Governor and Father of the Country, to deliver from, not en∣tangle her in the Chains of Tyranny and Usurpation.</P>
<P>But where Armies have march'd, private Travellers may certainly pass, and with that Assufance we chearfully pass'd the Tay trusting very much to that natural, known Civility, which the Scots, in the remotest Parts, always shew to Stran∣gers.</P>
<P>We left Strathern therefore, with the little Country of Menteith, for our Re∣turn, and went down into Angus, on the Northern Banks of Tay to Dundee, a pleasant, large, populous City, and well deserves the Title of Bonny Dundee, so often given it in Discourse, as well as in Song (Bonny in Scots, signifying Beau∣tiful).</P>
<P>As it stands well for Trade, so it is one of the best trading Towns in Scot∣land, and that as well in foreign Business as in Manufacture and Home Trade. It has but an indifferent Harbour, but the Tay is a large, safe, and good Road, and there is a deep Water, and very good An∣chor-Hold almost all over it.</P>
<P>It is exceedingly populous, full of state∣ly Houses, and large handsome Streets; particularly it has four very good Streets, with a large Market place in the Middle, the largest and fairest in Scotland, except only that of Aberdeen. The Tolbooth, or Town-Hall is an old, but large and convenient Building.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants here appear like Gen∣tlemen, as well as Men of Business, and yet are real Merchants too, and make good what we see so eminently in Eng∣land, That true bred Merchants are the best of Gentlemen. They have a very good and large Correspondence here with England, and ship off a great Deal of Lin∣nen thither, also a great Quantity of Corn is sent from hence, as well to Eng∣land as to Holland. They have likewise a good Share of the Norway Trade; and as they ar concern'd in the Herring Fishery, they consequently have some East Coun∣try Trade▪ viz. to Dantzick, Konings∣berg, Riga, and the neighbouring Parts. They send Ships also to Sweden, and import Iron, Coppor, Tar, Pitch, Deals, &amp;c. from the several trading Ports of that Kingdom.</P>
<P>These several Trades occasion a Con∣course of Shipping at the Port; and there are not a few Ships belonging to the Place. The Country behind them call'd the Carse, or the Carse of Gowry, with tht Vale mention'd above of Str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thmoor; for Strath, in their Dialect, signifies a Vale, or level Country; I say, all that Country abounds in Corn, and the Poon, of Dundee ships off great Quan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilt the when a plentiful Crop allows it, tof the great Advantage of the Gentlement, is well as Farmers; for as the Gentler, or receive all their Rents in Kind, these, would find a great Difficulty sometimes▪ to dispose of it, if the Merchant here did not ship it off, either for London or Amsterdam.</P>
<P>The Town of Dundee stands at a little Distance from the Tay, but they are join'd by a Causeway or Walk, well pav'd with slat Free stone, such as the Side-ways in Cheapside and Cornhill, and Rows of Trees
<PB REF="532"/>
are planted on either Side the Walk, which makes it very agreeable. On one Part of this Walk are very good Warehouses for Merchandises, especially for heavy Goods; and also Granaries for Corn, of which sometimes they have a vast Quantity laid up here; and these being near the Har∣bour are convenient, as well for the hous∣ing of Goods, when landed, as for the easy shipping off what lies for Exporta∣tion.</P>
<P>The great Church was formerly colle∣giate, being the Cathedral of the Place, and was a very large Building; but Part of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was demolished in the Civil War; the Remainder is devided, like as others are at Edinburgh, Glasgow, &amp;c. into three Churches for the present Use of the Citizens.</P>
<P>They have also a Meeting house or two for the Episcopal Worship: for you are to take it once for all, that North by Tay, there are far more of the Episcopal Per∣swasion than are to be found in the South; and the farther North, the more so, as we shall see in its Order.</P>
<P>The Tower upon the great Church here is a handsome square Building, large, and antient, but very high, and is a good Ornament to the City; it resembles the great Tower upon the Cathedral of Can∣terbury, but not quite so high. There tw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne and well endow'd Hospital for Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd Townsmen of Dundee, where thy are well taken Care of, and provid∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for. The Pretender was in this City <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oon after his Landing, and staid here some Time before he advanced to Scoon; the Laird of Claverhouse of the Name of Graham, who was killed▪ as has been said, at the Battle of Gill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ran<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, was made Viscount of Dundee by King James VII; but enjoyed it not long. His Seat of Claverhouse is not far off, and he had the Estate annexed to the Consultulary of Dundee, given him with the Title, but 'tis now in the Duke of Dougl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss.</P>
<P>It is twenty Scots Miles from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Montrose, the Way pleasant, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fruitful and bespangled, as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a clear Night with Stars of the big¦gest Magnitude, with Gentlemens House<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thick as they can be supposed to stand with Pleasure and Conveniency. Among these is the noble Palace of Penmure forfeited in the late Rebellion by the un¦fortunate Earl of Penmure, who was him self wounded in the Fight near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and with that Action ruined a noble and antient Family, and a fine Estate. The Surname of the Family is Maul and Mau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣burgh, a small Port near Montross, bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the Name still to Posterity.</P>
<P>The Town and Port of Montrose, val∣garly, but ignorantly, called Montross, was our next Stage, standing upon the Eastmost Shore of Angus, open to the German, or, if you please now, the Ca∣ledonian Ocean, and at the Mouth or the little River South Esk, which makes the Harbour.</P>
<P>We did not find so kind a Reception among the common People of Angus, and the other Shires on this Side the Country, as the Scots usually give to Strangers▪ But we found it was because we were Eng∣lish Men; and we found that their Aver∣sion did <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot lye so much against us on Account of the late Successes at, and after the Rebellion, and the Forf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itur <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the many Noblemen and Gentlemen's Estates among them as fell on that Occa¦sion, though that might add to the Dis∣gust: But it was on Account of the Uni∣on, which they almost universally ex∣claimed against, tho' sometimes against all manner of just Reasoning.</P>
<P>This Town of Montrose is a Sea port, and, in Proportion to its Number of In∣habitants, a considerable Trade, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tolerably well built, and capable of being made strong, only that it extends too far in Length.</P>
<P>The French Fleet first made Land at this Port, when they had the Pretender
<PB REF="533"/>
on Board, in the Reign of Queen Ann; having overshot the Mouth of the Firth so far, whither they had first designed: But this Mistake, which some thought a Misfortune, was certainly a Deliverance to them; for as this mistake gave Time to the English Fleet to come up with them, before they could enter the Firth, so it left them Time and Room also to make their Escape, which, if they had been gone up the Firth, they could never have done, but must inevitably have been all burnt and destroyed, or taken by the British Fleet under Sir George Bing, which was superior to them in Force.</P>
<P>From Montrose the Shore lies due North to Aberdeen: By the Way is the Castle of Dunnoter, a strong Fortificati∣on, upon a high Precipice of a Rock, looking down on the Sea as on a Thing infinitely below it. The Castle is walled about with invincible Walls, said the honest Scots Man that shewed us the Road to it, having Towers at proper Distances, after the old Way of fortifying Towns.</P>
<P>This was chiefly made use of as a Pri∣son for State-Prisoners; and I have seen a black Account of the cruel Usage the unhappy Prisoners have met with there; but those Times are over with Scotland. The Earl Marshal, of the Name of Keith, was the Lord of this Castle, as also of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House near it, but not a great Estate, and what he had is now gone; for being in the late Rebellion his Estate is forfeit∣ed; and we are told his Lordship, mak∣ing his Escape, is now in the Service of Spain, where he commands an Irish Re∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment of Foot.</P>
<P>From hence there is nothing remarkable till we come to Aberdeen, a Place so emi∣nent, that it commands some Stay upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t yet, I shall contract its Description as much as possible, the Compass of my Work being so great, and the Room, I have for it so small.</P>
<P>Aberdeen is divided into two Towns or Cities, and stands at the Mouth of two Rivers; the Towns are the New and the Old Aberdeen, about a Mile distant from one another, one situate on the River Don or Dune, the other on the River Dec, from whence it is supposed to take its Name; for Aber, in the old British Lan∣guage, signifies a Mouth, or Opening of a River, the same which in Scotland is understood by a Frith or Firth: So that both these Towns are described in the Name, (viz) Aberdee, the Mouth of the River Dee, and Aberdeen, the Mouth of the River Don. So in the South-West Part of the Shores of Britain, and in Wales, we have Aberconway, the M uth of the River Conway, Aberistwith, and several others.</P>
<P>The Old Aberdeen, on the Bank of the Don, must, without doubt, be very anti∣ent; for they tell us the New Aberdeen is supposed to be upwards of 1200 Years old. Nor do any of their Registers tell us the particular Time of its being built, or by whom. The Cities are equally si∣tuated for Trade, being upon the very Edge of the Sea; and 'tis the common Opinion, th t Part of the old City was wash'd down by the Sea; so that it oblig∣ed the Citzens to build farther off: This Part was that they called the Monastery, and this may give Rise to that Opinion, that thereupon they went and built the New Aberdeen upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank of the other River, and which 'tis evident, is built upon a Piece of hilly Ground, or upon three Hills: But this is all Conjecture, and has only Probability to support it, not any thing of History.</P>
<P>Old Aberdeen is also on one Side the County, and New Aberdeen on another, though both in that which is called in general the County of Marr. The Ex∣traordinaries of Aberdeen, take both the Cities together, are

<P N="1">1. The Cathedral dedicated to St. Ma∣char, tho' none knows who that Saint was, is a large and ancient Building; the Building majestick, rather than curious, and yet not without its Beauty in Architecture; it appears to have been built at se∣veral Times▪ and perhaps, at the Di∣stance of many Years, one Part from another. The Columns on which the great Steeple stands are very artful, and the Contrivance shews great Judgment in the Builder or Director of the Work. This Church has been divided into several Parts since the abolishing of Episcopacy, as a Government in the Church; (for it is not abolished in Aberdeen, as a Principle, to this Day) abundance of the People are still Episcopal in their Opinion; and they have, by the gentle Government they live under, so much Liberty still, as that they have a Chapel for the public Exercise of their Worship, after the Manner of the Church of England, besides several Meetings for the E∣piscopal Dissenters, which are not so Publick.</P>

The New College, which is in the New City of Aberdeen, and is called the Marshallian or Marshal's College, be∣cause founded by Keith Earl-Mar∣shal, in the Year 1593. And though it was a magnificent Building at first, and well endow'd, yet the Citizens have much beautify'd and enlarg'd it, and adjoin'd to it a noble Li∣brary well stock'd with Books, as well by the Citizens as by the Be∣nefactions of Gentlemen, and Lovers of Learning; as also with the finest and best Mathematical Instruments.</P>

<P>Also a Humanity School with a Ma∣ster and three Ushers, and a Mu∣sick School; the Humanity School was founded by Dr. Dune.</P>
<P>Those two Colleges form the Uni∣versity, and are so call'd, but they are independent on one another; they are fam'd for having bred ma∣ny Men of Learning; but that is not to my Purpose here.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Article is the great Market place, which, indeed, is very beautiful and spacious; and the Streets adjoining are very handsome and well-built, the Hou∣ses lofty and high; but not so as to be inconvenient, as in Edin∣burgh; or low, to be contempti∣ble, as in most other Places. But the Generality of the Citizens Houses are built of Stone four Story high, handsome Sash-Win∣dows, and are very well well fur∣nish'd within, the Citizens here being as gay, as gente<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, and per∣haps, as rich, as in any in Scotland.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Bridges; particularly that at Old Aberdeen, over the Don: It consists of one immense Arch of Stone, sprung from two Rocks, one on each Side, which serve as a Buttment to the Arch, so that it may be said to have no Founda∣tion, nor to need any. The Work∣manship is artful, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o firm, that it may possibly End with the Conflagration only. The other Bridge is upon the River Dee, a∣bout a Mile West above New A∣berdeen, and has seven very stately sine Arches. There are several other Buildings which should be describ'd, if our Work was to dwell here, as the Alms Houses, Hospitals, the great Church of St. Nicholas, divided into three, with the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeple, and the two vast Bells in it; the Custom-House, the Wharf, the Port; all which, con∣sidering what Part of the World they are in, are really extraordi∣nary, and that brings me to the fifth and sixth Articles, which are, indeed of the same Kind, viz.</P>
<P N="5">5. and 6. The Commerce and the Fishery.</P>
<P>The Fishery is very particular; the Salmon is a surprising Thing, the Quan∣tity that is taken in both Rivers, but es∣pecially in the Dee, is a Kind of Prodigy; the Fishing, or Property, is erected into a Company, and divided into Shares, and no Person can enjoy above one Share at a Time; the Profits are very considerable, for the Quantity or Fish taken is exceed∣ing great, and they are sent Abroad into several Parts of the World, particularly in∣to France, England, the Baltick, and se∣veral other Parts.</P>
<P>The Herring Fishing is a common Bles∣sing to all this shore of Scotland, and is like the Indies at their Door; the Merchants of Aberdeen cannot omit the Benefit, and with this they are able to carry
<PB REF="536"/>
on their Trade to Dantzick and Konings∣berg, Riga and Narva, Wybourgh and Stockholm, to the more Advantage.</P>
<P>They have a very good Manufacture of Linnen, and also of Worsted Stock∣ings, which they send to England in great Quantities, and of which they make some so fine, that I have seen them sold for fourteen, and twenty Shillings a Pair. They also send them over to Holland, and into the No th and East in large Quantities.</P>
<P>They have also a particular Export here of Pork, p ckl'd and packed up in Bar¦rels, which they chiefly sell to the Dutch for the victualling their East-India Ships and their Men of War, the Aberdeen Pork having the Reputation of being the best cured, for Keeping on very long Voyages, of any in Europe.</P>
<P>They export also Corn and Meal, but they generally bring it from the Fifth of Murray, or Cromarty, the Corn com∣ing from abou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inverness, where they have great Quantities.</P>
<P>In a Word, the People of Aberdeen are universal Merchants, so far as the Trade of the Northern Part of the World will extend. They drive a very great Trade to Holland, to France, to Ham-brough, to Norway, to Gottenburgh, and to the Baltick; and it may, in a Word, be esteemed as the third City in Scotland, that is to say, next after Edinburgh and Glasgow.</P>
<P>From Aberdeen the Coast goes on to a Point of Land, which is the farthest North-East Part of Britain, and is called by the Sailors Suchanness, being in the Shire or County of Buchan. It was to this Point the French Squadron, with the Pretender on Board, in the Reign of Queen Ann, kept their Flight in Sight of the Shore, being thus far pursued by Sir George Bing with the English Fleet: But from hence steering away North East, as if for the Norway Coast, and the English Admiral seeing no Probability of coming up with them, gave over the Chase, when they, altering their Course in the Night, stood away South, and came back to Dunki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> where they set out.</P>
<P>Upon this Part are several good Towns▪ as particularly Peter-Head; a good Mar∣ket Town and a Port with a small Har∣bour for Fishing Vessels, but no consider∣able Trade, Aberdeen being so near.</P>
<P>This Country, however remote, is full of Nobility and Gentry, and their Seats are seen even to the extremest Shores: The Family of Frazer carrys its Name to Frazerburgh, on the very Northenmost Point of the County. Ereskines Earls of Marr, have their Family Seat at Kil∣drummy, in the County of Marr, a little South of this Part of the Country, where the late unhappy Earl first set up his Stan∣dard of the Pretender. The Hayes▪ Earls of Errol, are in Buchan; and the Family of Forbes, Lord Forbes, and Forbes Lord Pitsligo, are still farther, and the latter on the very Shore of the Caledonian Ocean.</P>
<P>Nor does the remote Situation hinder, but these Gentlemen have the politest and brightest Education and Genius of any People so far North, perhaps, in the World, being always bred in Travel Abroad, and in the Universities at Home. The Lord Pitsligo, just mentioned, though unhappi∣ly drawn into the Snare of the late Insur∣rection, and forfeiting his Estate with the rest, yet carries Abroad with him, where∣ever he goes, a bright Genius, a Head as full of Learning and sound Judgment, and a Behaviour as polite courtly, and full of all the good Qualities that adorn a noble Birth, as most Persons of Quality I ever saw.</P>
<P>Mr. Cambden relates, that on the Coast of this Country a great Piece of Amber was driven on Shore by the Force of the Sea, as big, to use his own Words, as a Horse I shall add nothing to the Story, because 'tis hard to give Credit to it; it is enough that I name my Author, for I
<PB REF="537"/>
could not learn from the Inhabitauts that they ever saw any more of it.</P>
<P>From hence, the East Shore of Scot∣land being at an End, the Land trends away due West; and the Shire of Bamf beginning, you see the Towns of Bamf, Elgin, and the famous Monastery of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther'd Body of King Duff was, after many Years, dug up, and discovered to be the same by some Tokens, which, it seems, were undoubted.</P>
<P>From this Point of the Land, I mean Buchan Ness, the Ships take their Distan∣ces, or Accounts, for their several Voyages; and what they call their Departure: As in England, they do from Winterton-Ness, on the North East Part of Norfolk, or in the Downs for the Voyages to the Southward.</P>
<P>From Fifeness, which is the Norther∣most Point, or Head Land on the Mouth of Edinburgh Firth, being the Souther∣most Land of Fife, to this Point of Buchan-Ness, the Land lyes due North and South, and the Shore is the Eastermost Land of Scotland; the Distance between them is Thirty-three Leagues one Mile, that is just 100 Miles; though the Mariners say that measuring by the Sea it is but Tweny-eight; and from Winterton-Ness, near Yarmouth, to this Point called Buchan-Ness, is just 300 Miles.</P>
<P>The River, or Firth of Tay, opens into the Sea, about four Leagues North from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ness; and as there is a Light-House on the Isle of May, in the Mouth of the Firth or Forth of Edinburgh, a little South of this Point, called F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe-Ness; so there are two Light Houses at the Entrance of the Firth of Tay, being for the Directions of the Sailors, when they are bound into that River; and particularly for their avoiding and sailing between two Sands or Shoals, which lye off from the South Side of the Entrance.</P>
<P>This Point of Land, called Buchan-Ness, is generally the first Land of Great Britain, which the Ships make in their Voyages Home from Arch Angel in Russia, or from their Whale-fishing Voy∣ages to Greenland and Spits-Berghen in the North Seas; and near this Point, namely, at Pitfligo, a great Ship was cast away in Queen Elizabeth's Time, bound Home from Arch-Angel, in which was the first Ambassador, which the great Duke of Muscovy sent to any of the Chistian Princes of Europe, and who was commission'd to treat with Queen Eliza∣beth for a League of Peace and Com∣merce; and on board which was a most valuable Present to the Queen of rich and costly Furrs; such as Sables, Ermine, black Fox Skins, and such like, being in those Days esteemed inestimable The Ambassadors, it seems, were saved and brought on Shore by the help of the Peo∣ple of Pitfligo; but the Ship and all the Goods, and among them the rich F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs, intended for the Queen, were all lost, to her Majesty's great Disappointment; for the Queen valued such fine Things exceed∣ingly.</P>
<P>At the Town of Peter Head there is a small Harbour with two small Piers; but it is all dry at Low-Water; So that the smallest Ships lye a▪Ground▪ and can only go in and out at High Water, and then only small Vessels.</P>
<P>From this Point of Easterly Land all that great Bay, or Inlet of the Sea▪ reach∣ing quite to the North of Scotland, is called Murray Firth; and the Norther∣most Point is Dungsby Head, which is the East Point of Caithness, and opens to Pentland Firth. By Pentland Firth you are to understand the Passage of the Sea beyond Caithness, that is to say between Scotland and the Isles of Orkney. This Bay, called Murray-Firth, is not in the Nature of a Firth, as that of Edinburgh or Tay, being the Mouth of Rivers; as the Number, or the Mouth of Thames in England: But it is an open Gulph or Bay in the Sea; as the Bay of Biscay, or the Gulph of Mexico are, and suchlike: And
<PB REF="538"/>
though it may receive several Rivers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as indeed it does, and as those Bays do; yet itself is an open Sea, and reaches from, as I have said, Peter-Head to Dungs by Head, opposite to the Orkneys; the Distance upon the Sea Twenty six Leagues one Mile, or Seventy-nine Miles; but it is almost twice as far by Land, because of the Depth of that Bay, which obliges us to travel from Pitfligo, West, near 70 Miles, till we come to Inverness</P>
<P>This Country of Buchan is, indeed, more to be taken Notice of from what is to be seen on the Sea Shore than in the Land; for the Country is mountainous, poor, and more barren than its Neigh∣bours; but as we coasted along West we came into a much better Country, par∣ticularly the Shires of Bamff, Elgin, and the Country of Murray, from whence the Bay, I just now mention'd, is called Mur∣ray Firth.</P>
<P>Murray is, indeed, a pleasant Country, the Soil fruitful, water'd with fine Rivers, and full of good Towns, but especially of Gentlemens Seats, more and more remark∣able than could, indeed, be expected by a Stranger in so remote a Part of the Country.</P>
<P>The River Spey, which even Mr Camb∣den himself calls a noble River, passes through the middle of the Country. Up∣on the Bank of this River the Duke of Gordon has a noble Seat call'd after his Name, Castle Gordon. It is, indeed a noble, large, and ancient Seat; as a Ca∣stle much is not to be said of it, for old Fortifications are of a small Import, as the World goes now; But as a Dwelling or Palace for a Nobleman, it is a very noble, spacious, and Royal Building; 'tis only too large, and appears rather as a great Town than as a House.</P>
<P>The present Duke has been embroil'd a little in the late unhappy Affair of the Pretender; but he got off without a for∣feiture, having prudently kept himself at a Distance from them till he might see the Effect of Things. The Duke has several other Seats in this Part of the Country; and which is still better, has a very great Estate.</P>
<P>All the Country, on the West side of the Spey, is surprisingly agreeable, being a flat, level Country, the Land rich and fruitful, well peopled, and full of Gentle∣men's Seats. This Country is a Tesh∣mony how much the situation of the Land is concern'd in the Goodness of the Climate; for here the Land being level and plain, for between twenty and thirty Miles together, the Soil is not only fruit∣ful and rich, but the Temperature of the Air is soften'd, and made mild and suitable to the fruitfulness of the Earth; for the Harvest in this Country, and in the Vale of Strath-Bogy, and all the Country to Inverness, is not only forward and early, as well as rich and strong; but 'tis more early than in North than in Northumber∣land, nay, than it is in Darbyshire, and even than in some Parts of the most southerly Counties in England; as par∣ticularly in the East of Kent.</P>
<P>As a Confirmation of this, I affirm that I have seen the New Wheat of this Coun∣try and Innerness brought to Market to Ed nburgh, before the Wheat at Edinburgh has been fit to reap; and yet the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar∣vest about Edinbnrgh is thought to be as forward as in most Parts, even of England itself. In a Word, it is usual for them to begin their Harvest, in Mur∣ray and the Country about it, in the Month of July, and it is not very unus∣ual to have New Corn fully Ripe and Thresh'd out, shipp'd off, and brought to Edinburgh to sale, w thin the Month of August.</P>
<P>Nor is the forwardness of the season the only Testimony of the Goodness of the soil here; but the Crops are large, the straw strong and tall, and the ear full; and that which is still more, the grain, and that particularly of the wheat, is as full,
<PB REF="539"/>
and the Kind as fine▪ as any I have seen in England.</P>
<P>In this rich Country is the City, or Town rather, of Elgin; I say City, be∣cause in ancient Time the Monks claim'd it for a City; and the Cathedral shews, by its Ruins, that it was a Place of great Magnificence. Nor must it be wonder'd at, if in so pleasant, so rich, and so agree∣able a Part, of the Country, all the rest being so differing from it, the Clergy should seat themselves in a proportion'd Number▪ seeing we must do them the Justice to say, that if there is any Place richer and more fruitful than another▪ they seldom fail to find it ont▪</P>
<P>As the Country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many rich inhabitants, and in the Town of Edgin in particular; for the Gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh, or the Court, for this Part of the Island, leave their Highland Habita∣tions in the Winter, and come and live here for the Diversion of the Place and Plenty of Provisions; and there is, on this Account, a great Variety of Gentle∣men for Society, and that of all Parties and of all Opinions, This makes Elgin a very agreeable Place to live, notwith∣standing its Distance, being above 450 measur'd Miles from London, and more, if we must go by Edinburgh.</P>
<P>This rich Country continues with very little intermission, till we come to Strath-Nairn, that is the Valley of Nairn, where it extends a little farther in Breadth to∣wards the Mountains. Nor is Straith-Nairn behind any of the other in Fruit∣fulness: #From the Western Part of this Country you may observe that the Land goes away again to the North; and, as if you were to euter into another Island beyond Britain, you find a large Lake or Inlet from the Sea of Murray, men∣tion'd above, going on West, as if it were to cut through the Island, for we could see no End of it; nor could some of the Country People tell us how far it went, but that it reach'd to Loqua∣bre: So that we thought, till our Maps and farther inquities inform'd us, it had join'd to the Western Ocean.</P>
<P>After we had travell'd about 12 Miles, and descended from a rising Ground, which we were then upon; we perceived the Lake contracted in one particular Place to the ordinary size of a River, as if design'd by Nature to give passage to the inhabitants to converse with the Northern Part, and then, as if that Part had been sufficiently perform'd, it open'd again to its former Breadth, and continued in the Form of a large Lake, as before, for many more Miles than we could see; being in the whole, according to Mr. Cambden, twenty-three Miles long; but if it be taken on both Sides the Pass, 'tis above thirty-five Miles in Length.</P>
<P>This Situation must necessarily make the narrow Part be a most important Pass, from the South Part of Scotland to the Northern Countries, which are beyond it. We have been told the Romans never bonquer'd thus far; and those that mag∣nify the Conquests of Oliver Cromwell in Scotland to a Height beyond what was done by the Romans, insist much upon it, that the Romans never came into this Part of the Country: But, if what Mr Cambden records, and what is con∣firm'd by other Accounts from the Men of Learning and of Observation, this must be a Mistake; for Mr. Cambden says, that near Bean-Castle in the County of Nairn, there was found, iu the Year 1460, a fine Marble Vessel finely carv'd▪ which was full of Roman Coins of seve∣ral Sorts; also several old Forts or Mounts have been seen here, which, by their Re∣mains, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vidcutly shew'd themselves to be Roman: But that Ehquiry is none of my Work.</P>
<P>In the narrow▪Pass (mention'd above over the Lake) stands the Town and Fortress
<PB REF="540"/>
of Inner-Ness, that is a Town on the in∣ner Bank of the River Ness. The Situ∣ation of it, as I have said before, inti∣mates that it is a Place for Strength; and accordingly it has a Castle, founded in antient Times to command the Pass: And some Authors write that it was antiently a Royal House for the Kings of Scot∣land. Be that as it will, Oliver Crom∣well thought it a Place of such Impor∣tance; that he built a strong Citadel here, and kept a stated Garrison always in it, and sometimes more than a Garrison, find∣ing it needful to have a large Body of his old Veteran Troops posted here to pre∣serve the Peace of the Country, and keep the Highlands in Awe, which they did effectually all his Time.</P>
<P>Here it is observed, that at the End of those troublesome Days, when the Troops on all Sides came to be disbanded, and the Men dispersed, Abundance of the English Soldiers settled in this fruitful and cheap Part of the Country, and two Things are observed from it as the Con∣sequence.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the English falling to Husban∣dry, and Cultivation of the Earth after their own Manner, were in∣strumental, with the Help of a rich and fruitful Soil, to bring all that Part of the Country into so good a Method and Management, as is ob∣served to outdo all the rest of Scot∣land to this Day; and this not a lit∣tle contributes to the Harvest being so early, and the Corn so good, as is said above; for as they reap ear∣ly, so they sow early, and manure and help the Soil by all the regular Arts of Husbandry, as is practised in England, and which, as they learnt it from England, and by English Men, So they preserve the Know∣ledge of it, and also the Industry at∣tending it, and required for it to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">2. As Cromwell's Soldiers initiated them thus into the Arts and Industry of the Husbandman,▪ so they left them the English Accent upon their Tongues▪ and they preserve it also to this Day; for they speak perfect English, even much better than in the most Southerly Provinces of Scot∣land; nay; some will say that they speak it as well as at London; tho' I do not grant that neither. It is certain they keep the Southern Ac∣cent very well, and speak very good English.</P>
<P>They have also much of the English Way of living among them, as well in their Manner of Dress and Customs, as also of their Eating and Drinking, and even of their Dressing and Cookery, which we found here much more agreeable to English Stomachs than in other Parts of Scotland; all which▪ and several other Usages and Customs, they retain from the setting of Three Regiments of Eng∣lish Soldiers here, after they were dis∣banded, and who had, at least many of them, their Wives and Children with them.</P>
<P>The Fort, which was then built, and since demolished, has been restored since the Revolution; and a Garrison was al∣ways kept here by King William, for the better regulating the Highlands; and this Post was of singular Importance in the Time of the late Insurrection of the Lord Marr for the Pretender; when, though his Party took it, they were driven out again by the Country, with the Assistance of the Earl of Sutherland, and several other of the Nobility and Gentry, who stood fast to the King's Interest.</P>
<P>Here is a stately Stone Bridge of seven large Arches over the River Ness, where, as I said above, it grows narrow between the Sea and the Lake; small Vessels may come up to the Town: but larger Ships, when such come thither, as they often
<PB REF="541"/>
do for Corn, lye at some Distance East from the Town.</P>
<P>When you are over this Bridge you enter that which we truly call the North of Scotland, and others the North High∣lands; in which are several distinct Shires, but cannot call for a distinct Description, because it is all one undistinguish'd Range of Mountains and Woods, overspread with vast, and almost uninhabited Rocks and Steeps, fill'd with Deer innumera∣ble, and of a great many Kinds; among which are some of those the Antients cal∣led Harts and Roebucks, with vast over∣grown Stags and Hinds of the Red Deer Kind, and with Fallow Deer also.</P>
<P>And here, before I describe this fright∣ful Country, it is needful to observe that Scotland may be thus divided into four Districts, or distinct Quarters, which, however, I have not seen any of our Geographers do before me; yet, I believe, may not be an improper Measurement for such as would form a due Idea of the whole in their Minds, as follows;</P>
<P N="1">1. The South Land, Or that Part of Scotland South of the River Tay, drawing a Line from the Tay, about Perth, to Loch-Lomond, and down again to Dumbarton, and the Bank of Clyde.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Middle, or Midland, Being all the Country from the Tay and the Lough-Lomon, North to the Lake of Ness and the Aber, including a long Slope to the South, taking in the Western Highlands of Argyle and Lorn, and the Isles of Isla and Iura.</P>
<P N="3">3. The North Land, Being all the Country beyond Innerness and the Lough, or River Ness, North draw∣ing the Line over the narrow Space of Glengary, between the Ness and the Aber, and bounded by them both from the Eastern to the Western Sea.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Islands; Being all the Western and Northern Islands (viz.) the He∣brides, the Skye, the Orkneys, and the Isles of Shetland.</P>
<P>Upon the Foot of this Division I am now, having pass'd the Bridge over the Ness, enter'd upon the third Division of Scotland, called the North Land; and it is of this Country that, as I am saying, the Mountains are so full of Deer, Harts, Roe-bucks, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here are also a great Number of Eagles which breed in the Woods, and which prey upon the young Fawns when they first fall. Some of these Eagles are of a mighty large Kind, such as are not to be seen again in those Parts of the World.</P>
<P>Here are also the best Hawks of all the Kinds for Sport which are in the Kingdom, and which the Nobility and Gentry of Scotland make great Ule of; for not this Part of Scotland only, but all the rest of the Country abounds with Wild-Fowl.</P>
<P>The Rivers and Lakes also in all this Country are prodigiously full of Salmon; it is hardly credible what the People relate of the Quantity of Salmon taken in these Rivers, especially in the Spey, the Nairn, the Ness, and other Rivers thereabout. The several Countries beyond the Ness are

<P>The Earl of Sutherland has a Castle beyond Innerness, called Dunrobin, situate on the Eastern Shore, which his Lordship was sent down by Sea to take an early Possession of in the late Rebellion; and which, if he had not done, would soon have fallen into the Hands of the late Earl of Marr's Party; but by his coming timely thither it was prevented, and the Country on that Side kept from joining the Troops of the Pretender, at least for that Time.</P>
<P><PB REF="542"/>
Innerness is a pleasant, clean, and well built Town: There are some Merchants in it, and some good share of Trade. It consists of two Parishes, and two large, handsome Streets, but no publick Build∣ings of any Note, except as above, the old Castle and the Bridge.</P>
<P>North of the Mouth of this River is the famous Cromarty Bay, or Cromarty Firth, noted for being the finest Harbour, with the least Business, of perhaps, any in Britain▪ 'tis, doubtless, a Harbour or Port, able to receive the Royal Navy of Great Britain, and, like Milford Haven in Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, both the going in and out safe and secure: But as there is very little Shipping employ'd in these Parts, and little or no Trade, except for Corn, and in the Season of it some Fishing; so this noble Harbour is left i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tirely useless in the World.</P>
<P>Our Geographers seem to be almost as much at a loss in the Description of this North Part of Scotland, as the Romans were to conquer it; and they are oblig'd to fill it up with Hills and Mountains, as they do the inner Parts of Africa, with Lyons and Elephants, for want of knowing what else to Place there. Yet this Country is not of such difficult Ac∣cess, as to be pass'd undescrib'd, as if it were impenetrable; here being on the Coast Dornoch a Royal Burgh, situate upon the Sea, opposite to that which they call Tarbat Bay, eminent for the prodigious Quantity of Herrings taken, or, which rather might be taken here in their Season. There is a Castle here belonging also to the Earl of Southerland, and it was the Seat of a Bishop; but the Cathedral, which is but mean, is now otherwise employ'd</P>
<P>All the Country beyond this River, and the Loch flowing in it, is call'd Caithness, and extends to the Northermost Land in Scotland.</P>
<P>Some People tell us they have both Lead, Copper, and Iron in this Part of Scotland; and I am very much inclin'd to believe it: But it seems reserv'd for a future, and more industrious Age to search into; which, if it should happen to ap∣pear, especially the Iron, they would no more have Occasion to say, that Nature furnish'd them with so much Timber, and Woods of such vast Extent to no Purpose, seeing it may be all little enough to sup∣ply the Forges for working up the Irish Stone, and improving that useful Pro∣duct: And should a Time come when these hidden Treasures of the Earth should be discover'd and improv'd. This Part of Scotland may no longer be call'd Poor, for such a Production would soon change the Face of Things, bring Wealth and People, and Commerce to it; fill their Harbours full of Ships, their Towns full of People; and, by consuming the Provisions, bring the Soil to be cultivated▪ its Eish cur'd, and its Cattle consum'd at Home▪ and so a visible Prosperity would shew itself among them.</P>
<P>Nor are the Inhabitants so wild and barbarous as, perhaps they were in those Times▪ or as our Writers have pretend∣ed. We see every Day the Gentlemen born here, such as the Mackenzies, Mac∣Leans, Dondonalds, Gordons, Mac-Kays, and others, who are nam'd among the Clans, as if they were Barbarians, appear at Court, and in our Camps and Armies, as polite, and as finish'd Gentlemen as any from other Countries, or even among our own; and, if I should say, outdoing our own in many Things, especially in Arms and Gallantry, as well Abroad as at Home. But I am not writing Pane∣gyricks or Satyrs here, my Business is with the Country: There is no Room to doubt, but in this remote Part of the Island the Country is more wild and uncultivated, as it is mountainous, and (in some Parts) thinner of Inhabitants, than in the more Southern Parts of the Island.</P>

<P>This occasions the People to live dis∣pers'd among the Hills without any set∣tl d Towns. Their Employment is chief∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nting, which is▪ as we may say, for their Food; though they do also breed large Quantities of black Cattle, with which they pay their Lairds or Leaders the Rent of their Lands: And these are the Cattle which, even from the remotest Parts, as well as from other in the West and South, are driven annually to England to be sold, and are brought up <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> London, especially into the Coun∣tries of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex.</P>
<P>Having thus, as I say▪ few or no Towns to describe North of Innerness, it must <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nffice, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I thus give a just Description of the Country in general: For Exam∣pl It is surrounded with the Sea, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s two great Inlets of Water, men∣tion'd above, call'd the Ness and the Abre: So that except a small Part, or N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of Land, reaching from one to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and which is not above six Miles, I mean that Country which Mr. Camb∣den calls the Garrow, or Giengarrough, other▪ Glengary; I say, this Neck of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and excepted, the whole Division, as form'd above under the Head of the North Land, would be a disti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct Island, seperated from all the rest of Great Britain, as effectually as the Orkneys or the Isle of Skey is se∣parated from this.</P>
<P>In a Word, the great Northern Ocean surrounds this whole Part of Scotland; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Part of it to the East, mention'd just now, lyes open to the Sea without any Cover; the West and North Parts are, as it were, surrounded with Out-works as Defences, to break off the raging O∣cean from the North; for the Western Islands on one Side, and the Orkneys on the other, lie so many advanc d Fortifica∣tions or Redoubts, to combat that Ene∣my at a Distance. I shall view them in their Course.</P>
<P>From Dunrobin Castle which I mention'd before, you have nothing of Note offers itself, either by Sea or Land; but an extended Shore lying North and South without Towns and without Harbours, and indeed, as there are none of the first, so there are wanting none of the last; for, as I said of Cromarty Bay, there is a no∣ble Harbour without Ships or Trade: So here Nature, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if providentially fore∣seeing there was no Room for Trade, forbore giving herself the Trouble to form Harbour and Creeks where they should be useless, and without People.</P>
<P>The Land thus extended as above, lyes North and South to Dungsby-Head, which is the utmost Extent of the Land on the East side of Britain, North, and is distant from Cromarty eighteen Leagues North. This Point of Dingsby, or Dungsby-Head, is in the North Part, as I observ'd of Bu∣chan and Winnerton before; 'tis the Place from whence the Sailors take and keep their Accounts in their going farther North; As for Example;</P>
<P>From this Point of Dingsby-Head to the Fair Isle, which is the first of Shet∣land▪ or the last of the Orkneys, call it which we will, for it lyes between both, is 25 Leagues, 75 Miles.</P>
<P>From the same Dingsby Head to Sum∣burgh Head, that is to Shetland, is 32 Leagues, 96 Milos, and to Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wick Fort in Shetland 110 Miles.</P>
<P>Thus from Buchan Ness, to Sumburgh-Head in Shetland, is 47 Leagues.</P>
<P>And from Winterton Ness near Yar∣mouth, on the Coast of Norfolk, to Buchan

Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, on the Coast of Aberdeen▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 100 Leagues. So from Winterton to Shetland is 147 Leagues, 441 Miles.</P>
<P>But this is the proper Business of the Mariners. I am now to observe that we are here at the extremest End or Point of the Island of Great Britain; and that here the Land bears away West, leaving a large Strait or Sea, which they call Pentland Firth, and which divides, between the Island of Great Britain, and the Isles of the Orkneys; a Passage broad and fair, for 'tis not less than five Leagues over, and with a great Depth of Water; so that any Ships, or Fleets of Ships may go thro' it: But the Tides are so fierce, so uncertain, and the Gusts and suddain Squals of Wind so frequent, that very few Merchants-Ships care to venture thro' it; and the Dutch East India Ships, which come North about, (as 'tis called) in their Return from India, keep all farther off, and choose to come by Fair Isle, that is to say, in the Passage between the Islands of Orkney and Shetland. And here the Dutch send their Squadron of Men of War generally to meet them, because, as if it were in a narrow Lane, they are sure to meet with them there.</P>
<P>Here the Passage is not only broader; for it is at least nine Leagues from North Ranalsha, the farthest Island of the Ork∣neys, to Fair Isle, and five more from Fair Isle to Shetland: So that they have a Passage of fourteen Leagues between the Orkneys and Shetland, with only a small Island in the Way, which has no∣thing dangerous about it; also the Moun∣tainous Country being now all out of Reach; the Sea is open and calm, as in other Places: nor is there any dangerous Current or Shoals to disturb them.</P>
<P>In the Passage, between the Lands End of Britain and the Orkneys, is a small Island, which our Mariners call Stroma, Mr. Cambden and others Sowna; 'tis spoken much of as dangerous for Ships: But I see no Room to record any Thing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> draw Ships on Shore to their Misfortunes. Such Things I leave to the People who are of the Opinion the Devil has such Retreats for doing Mischief; for my own Part I believe him employed in Business of more Moment.</P>
<P>As Dingsby Head is the most Norther∣ly Land of Great Britain, 'tis wor h ob∣serving to you that here, in the Month of June, we had so clear an uninterrup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed Day, that, though indeed the Sun d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es ser, that is to say, the Horizon covers it's whole Body for some Hours, yet you might see to read the smallest Print, and to write distinctly, without the Help of a Candle, or any other Light, and that all Night long.</P>
<P>No wonder the antient Mariners, be they Phoenician or Carthaginian, or what else you please, who in those Days knew nothing of the Motion of the heavenly Bodies, when they were driven thus far, were surprised at finding they had lost the steady Rotation of Day and Night, which they thought had spread over the whole Globe.</P>
<P>No wonder they talked much of their Ultima Thule, and that the Elysian Fields must lye this Way; when they found that they were already come to everlast∣ing Day, they could no longer doubt but Heaven lay that Way, or at least that this was the high Way to it; and accord∣ingly, when they came Home, and were to give an Account of these Things a∣mong their Neighbours, they filled them with Astonishment; and 'twas wounderful they did not really fit out Ships for the Discovery; for who would ever have gone so near Heaven, and not ventured a little farther to see whether they could find it or no?</P>
<P>From hence West we go along the Shore of the Firth or Passage, which they call Pentland; and here is the House so fa∣mous, called John a Grot's House, where
<PB REF="547"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> the most northerly Land, as the People say, of Britain, though, I think, Dungs∣by-Head is as far North. 'Tis certain, however, the Difference is but very small, being either of them in the Latitude of 59 16th North, and Shetland reaching a∣bove two Degrees farther. The Domi∣nions of Great Britain are extended from the Isle of Wight, in the Latitude of 50 Degrees, to the Isles of Un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta in Shetland, in the Latitude of 61 Degrees, 30 Minutes, being Ten Degrees, or full 660 Miles in Length; which Island of Unst or Unsta being the most remote of the Isles of Shetland to the North East, lyes 167 Leagues from Winterton Ness in Nor∣folk.</P>
<P>Here we found, however, mountain∣ous and wild the Country appeared, the People were extremely well furnished with Provisions; and especially they had four Sorts of Provisions in great Plenty; and with a Supply of which 'tis reason able to say they could suffer no dangerous Want.</P>
<P N="1">1. Very good Bread, as well Oat Bread as Wheat, though the last so cheap as the first.</P>
<P N="2">2. Venison exceeding plentiful, and at all Seasons, young or old, which they kill with their Guns wherever they find it; for there is no Restraint, but 'tis every Man's own that can kill it. By which Means the High∣landers not only have all of them Fire Arms, but they are all excel∣lent Marksmen.</P>
<P N="3">3 Salmon in such Plenty as is scarce credible, and so cheap, that to those who have any Substance to buy with, it is not worth their while to catch it themselves. This they eat fresh in the Season, and for other Times they cure it by drying it in the Sun, by which they preserve it all the Year.</P>
<P>They have no want of Cows and Sheep, but the latter are so wild, that sometimes were they not, by their own Disposition, use to flock together, they would be much harder to kill than the Deer.</P>
<P>From hence to the West Point of the Passage to Orkney is near Twenty Miles, being what may be called the End of the Island of Britain; and this Part faces di∣rectly to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he North Pole; the Land, as it were, looking forward just against the Pole Star, and the Pole so elevated, that the Tail of the Ursa Major, or the Great Bear, is seen just in the Zenith, or over your Head; and the Day is said to be Eighteen Hours long, that is to say, the Sun is so long above the Horizon: Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the rest of the Light is so far beyond a Twilight, by reason of the Smalness of the Arch of that Circle, which the Sun makes beneath the Horizon, that it is clear and perfect Day almost all the T m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; not forgetting withal, that the dark Nights take their turn with them in their Sea∣son, and it is just as long Night in the Winter.</P>
<P>Yet it is observable here, that they have more temperate Winters here gener∣ally speaking, than we have to the most southerly Part of the Island, and particu∣larly the Water in some of the Rivers as in the Ness, for Example, never Freezes, nor are their Frosts ordinarily so lasting as they are in the most southerly Climates, which is accounted for from the nearness of the Sea, which filling the Air with moist Vapours, thickens the Fluids and and Causes, that they are not so easily penetrated by the severity of the Cold.</P>
<P>On this account the Snow's also are not so deep, neither do they lie so long upon the Ground, as in other Places, except it be on some of the high Hills, in the up∣per and innermost Part of the Country, where the Tops, or Summits of the Hills are continually cover'd with Snow, and perhaps have been so for many Ages, so that here if in any Place of the World
<PB REF="548"/>
they may justly add to the Description of their Country.</P>
<Q><L>—Vast wat'ry Lakes, which spread below,</L>
<L>And Mountains cover'd with eternal Snow▪</L></Q>
<P>On the most inland Parts of this Coun∣try, especially in the Shire of Ross, they have vast Woods of Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-Trees, not plant∣ed and set by Mens H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds, as I have described the fouthern Part of Scotland; but growing wild and undirected, other∣wise than as nature planted and nourished them up, by the additional help of Time, nay of Ages. Here are Woods reach∣ing from ten, to fifteen, and twenty Miles in length, and proportioned in breadth, in which there are Firrs, if we may believe the inhabitants, large enough to make Masts for the biggest Ships in the Navy Royal, and which are rendered of no Use, meerly for want of Conve∣nience of water Carriage to bring them away; also they assure us there are a sufficient Quantity of other Timber for a supply to all Britain.</P>
<P>How far this may be true, that is to say, as to the Quantity, that I not do undertake to determine: But I must add a needful Memorandum to the Scots No∣blemen▪ &amp;c. in whose Estates these Woods grow, that if they cannot be made useful one way, they may be made so another, and if they cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell the Timber, and cut it into Masts and Deals, and other useful Things for bringing away, having no Navigation; they may yet burn it, and draw from it vast quantities of Pitch, Tar, Rosin, Turpentine, &amp;c. which is of easier Carriage, and may be carried on Horses to the Water's edge, and then shipp'd for the use of the Merchant, and this way their Woods may be made profitable, whatever they might be be∣fore.</P>
<P>We find no Manufactures among the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/> men call their Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, namely, Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring of Woollen, or Linnen for their own Uses, and indeed not much of that; per∣haps, the time may come, when they may be better and more profitably em∣ploy'd that way; for if as I have ob∣serv'd, they should once come to We<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k the Mines, which there is reason to be∣lieve are to be found there, and to search the Bowels of the Earth, for Iron and Copper, the People would soon learn to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay at Home, and the Women would find Work as well as the Men: but this must be left to Time and Poste∣rity.</P>
<P>We were now in the particular Coun∣ty called Strathnaver, or the Vale on the Naver, the remotest Part of all the Island, though not the most barren or unfruitful; for here as well as on the Eastern shore is good Corn produced, and sufficiently of it at least for the in∣habitants; perhaps they do not send much abroad, though sometimes also they send it over to the Orkneys, and also to Shet∣land This County belongs to the Earl of Southerland whose oldest Son bears the Title of Lord Strathnaver.</P>
<P>And now leaving the Northern Pros∣pect we pass the opposite Point West from Dingsby-Head, and which the Peo∣ple call Farro Head, tho' Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (by what Authority, or from what Original, I know not) gives of a long Account of, and call these two Points by two op∣posite Names:—</P>
<P>The East Point, or Dungsby Head, he calls <HI>Virvedrum Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>The West Point or Farro Head, he calls <HI>Sarvedrum Promontorium.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the vast Western Ocean appears, what Name to give it the Geo∣graphers themselves do not seem to ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but it certaiuly makes a Part of the great Atlantick Sea, and is to be called by no other Name, for it has no Country to derive from.</P>
<P><PB REF="549"/>
And now we were to turn our Faces South for the Islands of this Sea, which make the fourth Division of Scotland, as mentioned before; I may if I have room give as just a Description of them as I can from authentick Relations; for be∣ing on Horseback and no Conveniences of Shipping presenting it self here, I am to own that we did not go over to those Islands personally, neither was it likely any Person whose Business was meer Curiosity and Diversion▪ should either be at the Expence▪ or run the Risque of such a hazardous Passage where there was so little worth Observation to be found.</P>
<P>We therefore turned our Faces to the South▪ and with great Satisfaction after so long and fariguing a Journey; and un∣less we had been assisted by the Gentle∣men of the Country, and with very good Guides, it had been next to an impossibi∣lity to have pass'd over this Part of the Country. I do confess if I was to re∣commend to any Men whose Curiosity tempted them to travel over this Part of the Country, the best Method for their Journeying, it should be neither to seek Towns▪ for it would be impos∣sible to find such in proper Stages for their Journey; nor to make themselves always burthensome to the High-land Chiefs, tho' there I can assure them they would always meet with great Treatment, and great Hospitality.</P>
<P>But I would propose Travelling with some Company, and carrying Tents with them, and so encamping every Night, as if they were an Army.</P>
<P>It is true they would do well to have the Countenance of the Gentlemen, and Chiefs as above, and to be recommended t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them from their Friends from one to another, as well for Guides as for Safety▪ otherwise I would not answer for what might happen: But if they are first well recommended as Strangers, and have Let∣ters from one Gentleman to another, they would want neither Guides nor Guards, nor indeed would any Man touch them; but rather protect them if there was Occasion in all Places; and by this Method they might in the Summer time Lodge, when▪ and wherever they pleased, with Safety and Pleasure; travelling no farther at a Time▪ than they thought fit; and as for their Provisions, they might supply themselves by their Guns, with very great plenty of Wild Fowl, and their Attendants and Guides would find convenient Places to furnish other Things sufficient to carry with them.</P>
<P>It would be no unpleasant account to relate a Journey which five, two Scots, and three English Gentlemen took in this manner for their Diversion, in order to visit the late Duke of Gordon, but it would be too long for this Place: It would be very diverting to shew how they lodg'd every Night. How two Highlanders who attended them, and who had been in the Army, went be∣fore every Evening and pitch'd their little Camp. How they furnish'd them∣selves with Provisions, carry'd some with them, and dreis'd and prepared what they kill'd with their Guns; and how very easily they travelled over all the Moun∣tains and Wasts, without troubling them∣selves with Houses or Lodgings; but as I say the Particulars are too long for this Place.</P>
<P>Indeed in our Attempt to come down to the Southward by the Coast of Tain, and the Shire of Ross, we should have been

extreamly Disappointed, and perhaps have been obliged to get a Ship or Bark, or have carry'd us round the Ifle of Sky in∣to Loquhaber, had it not been for the ex∣traordinary Courtesie of some of the Gen∣tlemen of the Country.</P>
<P>On the other hand we unexpectedly met here some English Men, who were employed by Merchants in the S. (whe∣ther at London or Edinburgh I do not now remember) to take and cure a large Quantity of White Fish, and afterwards of Herrings, on account of Trade. Here we had not only the Civility of their Assi∣stance and Accommodation in our Jour∣ney, but we had the Pleasure of seeing what Progress they made in their Under∣taking.</P>
<P>As for Herrings indeed the Quantity was prodigious, and we had the Pleasure of seeing something of the Prodigy, for I can call it no other; the Shoal was as I might say beginning to come, or had sent their Vant Couriers before them, when we first came to the Head of Pentland Firth, and in a Fortnight's Time more, the Body of their numberless Armies be∣gan to appear; but before we left the Coast you would have ventured to say of the Sea, as they do of the River Tibiscus, or Theisse in Hungary, that it was one third Water, and two thirds Fish; the Operation of taking them, could hardly be called Fishing, for they did little more than dip for them into the Water and take them up.</P>
<P>As to the Quantity, I make no scruple to say, that if there had been ten thou∣sand Ships there to have loaded with them, they might all have been filled and none of them mist; nor did the Fish seem to stay, but passed on to the South, that they might supply other Parts, and make way also for those innumerable Shoals which were to come after.</P>
<P>Had the Quantity of white Fish been any way proportioned to the Undertak∣ing as the Herring was, there would no doubt have been such Encouragement to the Merchant, that they would never have given it over, but they found it would not fully answer: Not but there were great Quantities of Cod, and the Fish very sizeable and good, but not so great a Quantity as to make that dispatch in taking them (as they are taken with Hook and Line) sufficient for Loading of Ships, or laying up a large Quantity in the Season; and this I doubt discouraged the Undertaking, the Merchants finding the Expence to exceed the Return.</P>
<P>Here we found the Town of Tain, and some other Villages tollerably well inhabited, and some Trade also, occasi∣oned principally by the Communication with the Western Islands, and also by the Herring Fishing, the Fishing Boats from other Parts often putting into these Ports; for all their Coast is full of Loughs and Rivers, and other Openings which make very good Harbours for Shipping; and that which is remarkable, some of those Loughs, are infinitely full of Herrings, even where, as they tell us, they have no Communication with the Sea, so that they must have in all probability been put in∣to them alive by some particular Hands, and have multiplied there as we find at this time.</P>
<P>We could understand nothing on this Side of what the People said, any more than if we had been in Morocco; and all the Remedy we had was, that we found most of the Gentlemen spoke French, and some few spoke broad Scots; we found it also much for our convenience to make the common People believe we were French.</P>
<P>Should we go about here to give you an Account of the Religion of the Peo∣ple in this Country, it would be an un∣pleasant Work, and perhaps scarce seem to deserve credit; you would hardly be∣lieve that in a Christian Island, as this is said to be, there should be People found who know so little of Religion, or of the
<PB REF="553"/>
Custom of Christians, as not to know a Sunday, or Sabbath, from a working Day, or the Worship of God from an ordinary Meeting, for Conversation: I do not affirm that it is so, and I shall say no more of it here, because I would not publish it, for it is to be hoped may in time find Redress; but I cannot but say that his Majesty's Gift of 1000l. annually to the Assembly of Scotland, for sending Ministers or Missi∣onaries for the propagating Christian know∣ledge in the Highlands, is certainly one of the most needful Charities that could have been thought of, worth of a King, and well suited to that Occasion; and if prudently applyed, as there is Reason to believe it will be, may in time break in upon this horrible Ignorance, that has so far spread over this unhappy Part of the Country.</P>
<P>On the other hand, What shall we say to the Neglect, which for so many Years past has been the Occasion of this sur∣prizing Darkness among the People, when the poor abandoned Creatures have not so much as had the common Instruction of Christianity, so much as to know whether there was any such thing as a God or no, much less how to worship him; and if at any time any Glympse of light had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fussed into them, and they had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught any Knowledge of superior Things; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> has been by the Diligence of the Popish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lergy, who to do them justice, have <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ewn more Charity, and taken more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that way, than some whose work it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been, and who it might much more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve been expected from?</P>
<P>But the State of Religion is not my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esent Subject; 'tis certain the People we the Bible in their own Language, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the Missionaries now are obliged preach to them, and examine or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Children in the Irs Language, that we are not to despair of having <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> County as well instructed in time, as is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Parts of Britain: the rest must be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his Hand, that over rules the Minds of Men, and causes them to know, even in Spite of the Defects, of common Teach∣ing.</P>
<P>On this Coast is the Isle of Eky, ly∣ing from the West North West, to the East South East, and bearing upon the Main Island, only separated by a narrow Strait of Water; someth ng like as the Isle of Wight is separated from the Coun∣ty of Southampton. We left this on our Right, and crossing the Mountains, came with as little Stay as we could to the Lough of Abre, that is, the Water which as I said above, assists with Lough Mess▪ or Loch Ness, to separte the North Land of Scotland, from the middle Part.</P>
<P>This is a long and narrow Inlet of the Sea which opening from the Irish Sea S. West, meets the River Abre, or as the Scots much more properly express it, the Water of Abre, for it it rather a large Lake or Loch, than a River, and receives in∣numerable small Rivers into it; it begins or rises in the Mountains of Ross▪ or of Glengary, within five or six Miles from the Shore of the Loch Ness, or the Wa∣ter of Ness, which is a long and narrow Lake it self and as the Ness runs away East to Inverness, and so into the great Gulph called Murray Firth; so the Abre becoming presently a Loch or Lake, also goes away more to the Southward, and sloping South West, runs into the Irish Sea as above.</P>
<P>From this River or Water of Abre, all that mountainous barren and frightful Country, which lies South of the Water of Abre is called Loquabre, or the Coun∣try bordering on Loch Abre. It is indeed a frightful Country full of hidious desart Mountains and unpassable, except to the Highlanders who possess the Precipices. Here in spight of the most vigorous Pur∣suit, the Highland Robbers, such as the famous Rob Roy in the late Disturbances, find such Retreats as none can pretend to follow them into, nor could he be ever taken.</P>
<P><PB REF="554"/>
On this Water of Abre, just at the En∣trance of the Lock, was anciently a Fort built, to curb the Highlanders, on either Side; it was so situated, that tho' it might indeed be block'd up by Land and be destress'd by a Siege, the Troops be∣sieging being Masters of the Field; yet as it was open to the Sea, it might always receive Supplies by Shipping▪ the Govern∣ment being supposed to be always Master of the Sea, or at least 'tis very probable they will be so.</P>
<P>This Fort the late King William caused to be rebuilt, or rather a new Fort to be erected; where there was always a good Garrison kept for curbing the Highlan∣ders, which Fort was for several Years commanded by Lieutenant General Mait∣land, an old experienc'd General, who had signalized himself upon many Occa∣sions abroad, particularly at the great Bat∣tle of Treves, where he served under the French and where he lost one of his Hands.</P>
<P>I Name this Gentleman, not to pay any Complement to him, for he is long ago in his Grave, but to intimate that this wise Commander did more to gain the Highlanders and keep them in Peace, and in a due Subjection to the British Go∣vernment, by his winning and obliging Behaviour, and yet by strict observance of his Orde s, and the Duty of a Govern∣our, than any other before him had been able to do by Force, and the Sword; and this particularly appear'd in the Time of the Union, when Endeavours were every where made use of, to bring th se hot People to break out into Rebellion, if possible to prevent the carrying on the Treaty.</P>
<P>At this Place we take our leave of the Third Division, which I call the North Land of Scotland, for this Fort being on the South Side of the Lock Abre is there∣fore called inner Lochy, as the other for the like Reason was called inner Ness.</P>
<P>We have nothing now remaining for a full Survey of Scotland, but the Western Part, of the Middle Part, or Division of Scotland, and this though a large Coun∣try, yet affords not an equal Variety with the Eastern part of the same Di∣vision.</P>
<P>To traverse the remaining Part of this Country, I must then begin up∣on the upper Tay, as we may just∣ly call it, where I left off when I turn'd away East; and here we have in especial manner the Country of Bre∣chin, the Blair as 'tis called of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hol, and the Country of Bradalbin: This is a Hilly Country indeed, but as it is water'd by the Tay, and many other pleasant Rivers which fall into it, there are also several fruitful Valleys, inter∣sperst among the Hills; nor are even the Highlands themselves, or the High∣landers the Inhabitants any thing so wild, untaught, or untractable, as those whom I have been a describing in the North-Land Division, that is to say, in Strath-Naver, Ross, Tain, &amp;c</P>
<P>The Duke of Athol is Lord, I was al∣most going to say King of this Country, and has the greatest interest, or if you please, the greatest share of Vassalage of any Nobleman in this Part of Scotland: if I had said in all Scotland, I believe I should have been supported by others that know both his Person and his Interest as well as most People do.</P>
<P>His Grace was always an Opposer of the Union in the Parliament holden at Edinburgh, for passing it into an Act; but he did not carry his Opposition to the Height of Tumult aud Rebellion; if he had, as some were forward to have had done, he would have possibly bid fair, to have prevented the Conclusion of it, at least at that Time: But the Hour was come, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Calamities of War, which had for so many hundred Years vext the two Nations, were to have as End; and tho' the Government was
<PB REF="555"/>
never weaker in Power than at that Time, I mean in Scotland, yet the Affair was carried thro' with a high Hand, all the little Tumults and Disorders of the Rab∣ble as well at Edinburgh as at Glasgow, and other Places, being timely supprest, and others by prudent Management pre∣vented</P>
<P>The Duke has several fine Seats in this Country; as first at Dunkeld, upon the Tay which I mentioned before, and where there was a Fight, between the regular Troops and the Highlanders, in the Reign of King William; another at Huntingtour, in the Strathern, or Valley of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the Duke has a fine Park, and great store of Deer; and it may in∣deed be called his Hunting Seat, whether he sometimes retires meerly for Sport.</P>
<P>But his ordinary Residence, and where I say he keeps his Court like a Prince, is at the Castle of Blair, farther North and beyond the Tay, on the Edge of Brad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lbin upon the Banks of a clear and fine River which falls into the Tay, a few Miles lower.</P>
<P>As I have said something of this Coun∣try of Bradalbin, it will be needful to say something more, seeing some other Authors have said so much: It is seated as near the Center of Scotland, as any Part of it can be well fixt, and that which is Particular, is, that it is alledg'd, it is the highest Ground in Scotland, for that the Rivers which rise here, are said to run every Way from this Part, some into the Eastern, and some into the West∣ern Seas.</P>
<P>The Grampian Mountains, which are <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere said to cut through Scotland; as the Muscovites sav of their <HI>Riphaean</HI> Hills, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are the Girdle of the World. As <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Country, so are the Inhabitants, a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eree fighting and furious Kind of Men; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t I must add that they are much changed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd civiliz'd from what they were for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erly, if Mr. Cambden's Account of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem is just. I mean of the Highlanders of Bradalbin only; tho' I include th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Country of Loquhabre, and Athol, as adjoyning to it.</P>
<P>It is indeed a very better Character, and possibly they might deserve it in those Days; but I must insist that they are quite another People now: And tho' the Coun∣try is the same, and the Mountains as wild and desolate as ever; yet the People, by the good Conduct of their Chiefs and Heads of Clans, are much more civilized than they were in former Times.</P>
<P>As the Men have the same Vigour and Spirit; but are under a bettet Regulation of their Manners, and more under Go∣vernment; so they make excellent Sol∣diers, when they come abroad, or are listed in regular and disciplin'd Troops.</P>
<P>The Duke of Athol, though he has not an Estate equal to some of the No∣bility; yet he his Master of more of these Superiorities, as they are called there, than many of those who have twice his Estate; and I have been told, that he can bring a Body of above 6000 Men together in Arms at a very little Warn∣ing.</P>
<P>The Pomp and State in which this no∣ble Person lives, is not to be imitated in Great Britain; for he is served like a Prince, and maintains a greater Equipage and Re∣tinue than five Times his Estate would support in another Country.</P>
<P>The Duke has also another Seat in S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rathe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, which is called Tullibardin, and which gives Title at this Time to the eldest Son of the House of Athol, for the Time being. At the lower Part of this Country, the River Earn falls into Tay, and greatly increases its Waters. This River rises far West, on the Fron∣tiers of the Western Highlands near Glen∣gyl, and running through that pleasant Country called Strathearn, falls into Tay, below St. Johnstons.</P>
<P>Soon after its first Coming out from the Mountains, the Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n spreads it self into a Loch, as most of those Rivers
<PB REF="556"/>
do, this is called Loch Earn, soon after which it runs by Duplin Castle, the Seat of the Earl of Kinnowl, whose Eldest Son is known in England, by the Title of Lord Duplin, taking it from the Name of this Castle. The late Earl of Kin∣nowl's Son, the Lord Duplin, was mar∣ryed to the Daughter of the late Earl of Oxford, then Lord High Treasurer of England, and who was on that Occasion made a Peer of Great Britain.</P>
<P>This Castle of Duplin, is a very beauti∣ful Seat, and the Heads of the Families having been pretty much used to live at home, the House has been adorned at several times, according to the Genius, and particular Inclination of the Persons, who then lived there; the present Earl is not much in Scotland; being created a Peer of Great Britain, in the Reign of the late Queen Anne, and marry'd, as above, into the Family of Oxford.</P>
<P>This ancient Seat is situated in a good Soil, and a pleasant Country, near the Banks of the River Earn, and the Earl has a very good Estate; but not loaded with Vassals, and Highland Superiorities, as the Duke of Athol is said to be.</P>
<P>The House is now under a new De∣coration, two new Wings being lately ad∣ded for Offices as well as Ornament.</P>
<P>The old Building is Spacious, the Rooms are large, and the Ciclings lofty, and which is more than all the Appearance of the Buildings, 'tis all magnificently finished, and furnished within; there are also Abun∣dance of very fine Paintings, and some of great Value, especially Court Pieces, and Family Pieces, of which it would take up a Book to write the Particu∣lars; but I must not omit the fine Picture of King Charles the First, with a Letter in his Hand, which he holds out to his Son the Duke of York, afterwards King James the Second, which they say he was to carry to France; also a Statue in Brass of the same King Charles the First on Horseback; there are also two Pictures of a contrary sort, Namely, one of Oliver Cromwell, and one of the then General Monk, both from the life.</P>
<P>Also there is a whole Length of that Earl of Kinnoul, who was Lord Chancel∣lor of Scotland, in the Reign of King James the Sixth, with several other peices of Italian Masters of great Value.</P>
<P>From this place we went to Brechin, an ancient Town with a Castle finely situate; but the ancient Grandour of it not sup∣ported; the Family of Penmure, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it belonged, having been in no extraordi∣nary Circumstances for some time past, and now their Misfortunes being finished, it is under Forfeiture, and sold among the Spoils of the late Rebellion.</P>
<P>We were now as it were landed again, being after a long Mountain-Ramble, come down to the Low Lands, and into a Plea∣sant and Agreeable Country; but as we had yet another Journey to take West, we had a like prospect of a rude and wild Part of Scotland to go through.</P>
<P>The Highlands of Scotland are divided into two Parts, and known so as to separ∣ate Countries, (viz.) the West Highlands, and the North Highlands; the last, of which I have spoken at large, contain the Countries or Provinces of

<P>On the Bank of this River Earn lies a very pleasant Vale, which continues from the Tay, where it receives the River quite up to the Highlands; this is called ac∣cording,
<PB REF="557"/>
to the Usage of Scotland Strath Earn, or the Strath or Vale of Earn, 'tis an agreeable Country; and has many Gen∣tlemens Seats on both Sides the River; but it is near the Highlands, and has often suffered by the Depredations of those wild Folk in former Times.</P>
<P>The Family of Montross, whose Chief was sacrificed for the Interest of King Charles the First, had a strong Castle here called Kincardin; but it was ruined and demolished in those Wars, and is not re∣built. The Castle of Drummond is al∣most in the same Condition, or at least is like soon to be so, the Earl of Perth, to whom it belongs, being in Exile, as his Father was before him, by their Adhering to the late King James the Seventh, and to the present Pretender King James the Seventh, made the Father a Duke, and Knight of the Garter, and Governor to his Son the Pretender. His Eldest Son who should have succeeded to the Hon∣ours and Titles dyed in France, and three other Sons still remaining are all abroad, either following the ruined Fortunes of the Pretender, or in other Service in Fo∣reign Courts; where, we know not, nor is it material to our present Purpose.</P>
<P>The Western Highlands are the only remaining Part of Scotland, which as yet I have not toucht upon. This is that Par∣ticular Country, which a late great Man in King James the Second's Time, called the Kingdom of Argyle; and upon which Occasion it was a Compliment upon King James, that he had conquered two Kings, when he suppressed the Rebellion of the Whigs; namely, the Duke of Monmouth, whom in Derision they called the little King of Lime, and the Earl of Argyle whom they called with much more Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riety, the great King of the Highlands.</P>
<P>It is true that the greatest Part of these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estern Highlands, may be said to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bject, or in some Respect to belong to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e House of Argyle, or to speake more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>operly, to the Family or Clan of the Campbells, of whom the Duke of Argyle is the Chief; but then it should be no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed too, that those Western Gentlemen are not so blindly to be led, or guided by their Chiefs as those in the North; nor when led on, are they so apt for Mischief and Violence. But as many of them are toucht with the Cameronian Whig, or at least the English Whig Principles, they would venture to enquire what they were to do, and whom to fight against, at least before they dipt far in any hazardous Un∣dertaking.</P>
<P>Though the People of these Countries are something more civiliz'd than those of their Bretheren Mountaineers in the North; yet the Countries seem to be near a kin that no Strangers could know them alunder, nor is there any Breach in the Similitude that I could observe, except it be that in the North Highlands, there are such great Woods of Fir Trees, which I have taken Notice of there, and which we do not see the like of here: Nor did we see so many or so large Eagles in these Western Mountins as in the North, tho' the People assure us there are such too.</P>
<P>The Quantity of Deer are much the same▪ and the Kinds to, and the black Cattle are of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> rather more numerous; the Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dress af∣ter the same manner, in the Plaid and the Troule, go naked from below the Knee to the mid Thighs, wear the Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and the Pistol at their Girdle, and the Targ or Tar∣get at their Shoulder.</P>
<P>Some reckon the Shire of Braidalbin to belong to these Western Highlands, not that it is West in its Situation, for it is ra∣ther North, and as I have mention'd, is said to be the Center of Scotland; and the highest Land, being in the very Body of those they call the Grampion Mountains; all the Reason that I could find they give for reconkoning this Country among the Western Highlands, is because they say one Part of it is inhabited by the Camp∣bels, whose Clan, as I have observed,
<PB REF="558"/>
generally possesses all the West High∣lands.</P>
<P>But if they will claim the Country, they must claim the People too, who are, if I may give my Opinion, some of the worst, most barbarous, and ill governed of all their Highlands of Scotland, they are desperate in Fight, cruel in Victory, fierce even in Conversation, apt to Quar∣rel, mischievous, and even Murderers in their Passion.</P>
<P>At the Fight which happen'd at Gil∣lekranky, in this Part of Scotland, they tell us a Story of a Combate between an English Soldier press'd hard by a Highlander, the Regiment being in Dis∣order, for the English had the worst of it; the English Soldier was singled out in the Pursuit by one particular High∣lander, and found himself in great Dan∣ger, he defended himself with the Club of his Musquet as long as he was able, his Shot being spent before, after which they came to their Swor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the English-Man understood the Backsword very well, but the Scots-Man received all the Blows upon his Targe; so that the English-Man could not come in with him, and at the same time he lay'd hard at the Eng∣lish-Man with his Broadsword, and had had Cut him in two or three Places, at which the English Man enraged, rather than discouraged, cryed out to him, <HI>you Dog,</HI> says he, <HI>come from behind the Dovr, and fight like a Man,</HI> meaning from behind his great Target; but the Scots-Man tho' as brave as the other, knew better Things than that, and lay∣ing hard at him cut him down, and was just going to kill him, when some of the regiment that saw him Distrest, came up to him, and rescu'd him, and took the Highlander Prisoner.</P>
<P>It is hard to distinguish too among those Highland-Men, who are the best Soldiers, Foreigners give it to the Nor∣thern Men as the more hardy and the larger Bodies; but I will not undertake to decide to this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> either of them make very good Soldiers, and all the World are fond of them; nor are they equalled in any part of the World that I have met with, if they are regi∣mented by themselves, unmixt with other Nations.</P>
<P>And here I must take an Opportunity to rectify a Mistake which has grown up to a vulgar Error, and is an injury to the Scots, in some Respect, at least it is rebbing them of that Honour, which is their due, the Case is this;</P>
<P>We have frequent Occasions to hear of the Fame of the Irish Battallions Abroad, how well they behave, and what good Troops they are, how they acted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a Bartle, and such; how in parti∣cular they beat the Germans out of Cremona, after they had got Possession of the Town, and had taken the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> General, the Marshal Viller<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> How the Irish Battalions in the Scots Service behaved in S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cily, and so on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣no extraordinary Occasions. Now though it is true that these are called <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ish, be∣cause they were Originally such; yet 'tis as true the Men are all or most of them Scots Highlanders, who upon all Occasions getting over into France, al∣ways List in the Irish Troops: Nay in the late Wars it was frequent to raise whole Regiments of Highlanders for the Service, but when they came over, they would take the first occasion to desert, and go over to the French, so to list in the Irish Battalions, for they all speak Irish, and some have affirmed, that they have first listed with that Resolution: being generally addicted to the interest of King James the Seventh; but be that so or not, this I am well assured of (viz) that most of those they call Irish in the Ar∣mies of France and Spain and to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m so many glorious Actions have been justly as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rib'd, are to this Day Scots H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> land∣ers, or at least, most of them are so, but this by the Way.</P>
<P><PB REF="559"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to our Progress. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Brechin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Streathearn, we went <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> West; but were presently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a vast inland Sea, rather than a Lake called Loch Lomond. It is in∣deed a Sea, and look'd like it from the Hills from whence we first descry'd it and its being a tempestuous Day, I assure you it appeared all in a Breach, rough and raging, like the Sea in a Storm. There are several Islands in it, which from the Hills we could plainly perceive were Islands, but that they are a-drift, and float about the Lake, that I take as I find it, for a Story, namely, a Story call'd a F—as I do also that of the Water of this Loch, turning Wood into Stone.</P>
<P>This Lake or Loch is, without Com∣parison, the greatest in Scotland, no other can be called half so big; for it is more than twenty Miles long, and generally eight Miles in Breadth, though at the North End of it, 'tis not so broad by far. It receives many Rivers into it, but empties itself into the▪ Firth of Clyde, at one Mouth; near the Entrance of it into Clyde, stands the famous Dunbar∣ton Castle, the most antient, as well as the most important Castle in Scotland; and the Gate, as 'tis called, of the High∣lands. It is now not much regarded, the the whole Country being, at it were, bu∣ried in Peace, yet there is a Garrison maintain'd in it; and the Pass would be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> great Import, were there any Oc∣casion of Arms in Time to come; 'tis exceeding strong by Situation, being se∣cured by the River on one Side the Firth, of Clyde on the other by an un∣passable Morass, on the third Side, and the fourth is a Precipice.</P>
<P>Passing from Dunbarton Castle, we en∣ter the Territory of Argyle. As to the County of Lenox, the paternal Estate and Property of the Stuarts, it lyes ex∣tended from both sides the Levin, that is, the River, which (as I said before) empties the Loch-Lomon into the Clyde. On this Side, or Eastward, joins to Mon∣teith, and runs up for some Length on the East Side of the Loch, and on the West Side it extends to the Edge of the Loch Loing, and a great Way North, almost to the Mountains of Loquha∣bre.</P>
<P>All our Writers of the Description of Lenox enlarge upon the Family of Stuarts, who proceeded, as by the Mother, from the Royal Line of Scotland: So by the Father, from Henry Lord Darnley▪ mar∣ry'd to Queen of Scots, and afterwards basely murder'd by her, or by her Order and Direction.</P>
<P>By this Lord Darnley, who was Son and Heir apparent to Matthew Earl of Lenox, this whole Estate, with the Ti∣tle, devolv'd at last upon K. Charles II. who gave the Title to one of his Natu∣ral Sons, with the Addition of Duke.</P>
<P>Beyond this Loch-Loing begins the large extended Country of Argyle, or the Western Highlands, whose Extent takes in the Shire or County of Lorn to the North, and Cantyre <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the South, all pos∣ses<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d by the Campbell's, and vulgarly understood by the Country of Argyle; for as for Cantyre, which is a Chersonese, or Peninsula, it belongs mostly, if not wholly to the Campbell's; and as to Lorn, 'tis the Title of the eldest Son of the House of Argyle to this Day.</P>
<P>The West side of this Country lies ex∣tended along the Irish Sea for a very great Length at least Eighty Miles. On all this shore there there is no Town emi∣nent for Trade, no Port or Harbour, at least none made use of for Shipping, nor are there any Ships to require them, ex∣cept Fishing-Barks and Boats, which are in the Season employed for catching Her∣rings, of which the Shoals that are found upon thfs Coast in the Season are incre∣dible, especially in the Clyde, in Loch-Finn, and about the Isle of Arran, which lyes in the Mouth of Clyde.</P>
<P>From the Mull of Cantyre they see Ireland very plain, it being not above fifteen
<PB REF="560" MS="y"/>
or sixteen Miles from the Point of Land, which they call the Mull to the Fair Foreland; on the Coast of Colrain▪ on the North of Ireland▪ In the Mouth of this Sea of Clyde lyes a Rock, some∣what like the Bass in the Firth of Forth, or of Edinbugh, not for Shape, but for this Particular, that here, as at the Bass, the Soland Geese are pleased to come in the Season of the Fishery, and to breed and inhabit as they do at the Bass, and to go away and come again just at the same Seasons, as at the Bass: This Island is called the Ailze. Here are also the Islands of Arran and of Bute; the first giving Title of Earl to the Family of Hamilton, and the other the Title of Duke of Roth∣say to the eldest Son of the Crown of Scotland, who is called Duke of Roth∣say, from the Castle of Rothsay in this Island; nor is there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be said of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for as for their present Condition, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is what is my particular Business in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is Book, they have nothing considerable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or about them, except it be a tumultuous and dangerous Sea for Sailors, especially when a South West Wind blows hard, which brings the Sea rowling in upon them in a frightful Manner. However, there is one good Harbour on the North Side of the Island, called Lamlach, which is their Safety in such Cases.</P>
<P>Off of the Western Shore of Argyle and Lorn there are Abundance of Islands, which all belong to the Family of Ar∣gyle, or at least to its Jurisdiction▪ as Ista, Jura, Tyrry, Mull, Lysmore, Coll, and several others of less Note.</P>
