<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Sir Launcelot Greaves.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which certain personages of this de∣lightful
history are introduced to the
reader's acquaintance.</HEAD>
<P>IT was on the great northern road
from York to London, about the
beginning of the month October, and
the hour of eight in the evening, that
four travellers were by a violent shower
of rain driven for shelter into a little
public house on the side of the high∣way,
distinguished by a sign which
was said to exhibit the figure of a black
lion. The kitchen, in which they
assembled, was the only room for en∣tertainment
in the house, paved with
red bricks, remarkably clean, furnish∣ed
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
with three or four Windsor chairs,
adorned with shining plates of pewter,
and copper sauce-pans nicely scoured,
that even dazzled the eyes of the be∣holder;
while a chearful fire of sea∣coal
blazed in the chimney. Three
of the travellers, who arrived on
horseback, having seen their cattle
properly accommodated in the stable,
agreed to pass the time, until the wea∣ther
should clear up, over a bowl of
rumbo, which was accordingly pre∣pared:
but the fourth, refusing to
join their company, took his station
at the opposite side of the chimney,
and called for a pint of two-penny,
with which he indulged himself apart.
At a little distance, on his left hand,
there was another groupe, consisting
of the landlady a decent widow, her
two daughters, the elder of whom
seemed to be about the age of fifteen,
and a country lad, who served both as
waiter and ostler.</P>
<P>The social triumvirate was com∣posed
of Mr. Fillet, a country practi∣tioner
in surgery and midwifery, Capt.
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
Crowe, and his nephew Mr. Thomas
Clarke, an attorney. Fillet was a
man of some education, and a great
deal of experience, shrewd, sly, and
sensible. Capt. Crowe had command∣ed
a merchant-ship in the Mediter∣ranean-trade
for many years, and
saved some money by dint of fruga∣lity
and traffick. He was an excel∣lent
seaman, brave, active, friendly
in his way, and scrupulously honest;
but as little acquainted with the world
as a sucking child; whimsical, impa∣tient,
and so impetuous that he could
not help breaking in upon the con∣versation,
whatever it might be, with
repeated interruptions, that seemed to
burst from him by involuntary im∣pulse:
when he himself attempted to
speak, he never finished his period;
but made such a number of abrupt
transitions, that his discourse seemed
to be an unconnected series of unfi∣nished
sentences, the meaning of which
it was not easy to decypher. His ne∣phew,
Tom Clarke, was a young fel∣low,
whose goodness of heart even
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
the exercise of his profession had not
been able to corrupt. Before stran∣gers
he never owned himself an at∣torney,
without blushing, though he
had no reason to blush for his own
practice; for he constantly refused to
engage in the cause of any client
whose character was equivocal, and
was never known to act with such in∣dustry
as when concerned for the wi∣dow
and orphan, or any other object
that sued <HI>in forma pauperis.</HI> Indeed
he was so repiete with human kind∣ness,
that as often as an affecting sto∣ry
or circumstance was told in his hear∣ing,
it overflowed at his eyes. Being
of a warm complexion, he was very
susceptible of passion, and somewhat
libertine in his amours. In other re∣spects,
he piqued himself on under∣standing
the practice of the courts,
and in private company he took plea∣sure
in laying down the law; but he
was an indifferent orator, and tediously
circumstantial in his explanations: his
stature was rather diminutive; but,
upon the whole, he had some title to
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
the character of a pretty, dapper, lit∣tle
fellow. The solitary guest had
something very forbidding in his aspect,
which was contracted by an habitual
frown. His eyes were small and red,
and so deep set in the sockets, that each
appeared like the undistinguished snuff
of a farthing-candle, gleaming through
the horn of a dark lanthorn. His no∣strils
were elevated in scorn, as if his
sense of smelling had been perpetually
offended by some unsavory odour;
and he looked as if he wanted to shrink
within himself, from the imperti∣nence
of society. He wore a black
periwig as straight as the pinions of
a raven, and this was covered with
an hat flapped, and fastened to his
head by a speckled handkerchief tied
under his chin. He was wrapped in
a great coat of brown frize, under
which he seemed to conceal a small
bundle. His name was Ferret, and
his character distinguished by three
peculiarities. He was never seen to
smile: he was never heard to speak
in praise of any person whatsoever;
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
and he was never known to give a di∣rect
answer to any question that was
asked: but seemed, on all occasions,
to be actuated by the most perverse
spirit of contradiction.</P>
<P>Capt. Crowe, having remarked that
it was squally weather, asked how far
it was to the next market-town; and
understanding that the distance was
not less than six miles, said he had a
good mind to come to an anchor for
the night, if so be as he could have a
tolerable <HI>berth</HI> in this here harbour.
Mr. Fillet, perceiving by his stile that
he was a sea-faring gentleman, obser∣ved
that their landlady was not used
to lodge such company; and expressed
some surprize, that he who had no
doubt endured so many storms and
hardships at sea, should think much
of travelling five or six miles a horse-back
by moon-light. “For my part,
said he, I ride in all weathers, and at
all hours, without minding cold, wet,
wind, or darkness. My constitution
is so case-hardened, that I believe I
could live all the year at Spitzbergen.
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
With respect to this road, I know
every foot of it so exactly, that I'll
engage to travel forty miles upon it
blindfold, without making one false
step; and if you have faith enough
to put yourselves under my auspices,
I will conduct you safe to an elegant
inn, where you will meet with the
best accommodation.” “Thank you,
brother, (replied the Captain:) we
are much beholden to you for your
courteous offer; but, howsomever,
you must not think I mind foul wea∣ther
more than my neighbours. I
have worked hard aloft and allow in
many a taught gale—but this here
is the case, d'ye see; we have run
down a long day's reckoning: our
beasts have had a hard spell; and as
for my own hap, brother, I doubt
my bottom-planks have lost some of
their sheathing, being as how I a'n't
used to that kind of scrubbing.”</P>
<P>The doctor, who had practised on
board a man of war in his youth,
and was perfectly well acquainted
with the Captain's dialect, assured him,
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
that if his bottom was damaged, he
would <HI>new-pay</HI> it with an excellent
salve, which he always carried about
him, to guard against such accidents
on the road: but Tom Clarke, who
seemed to have cast the eyes of affec∣tion
upon the landlady's eldest daugh∣ter,
Dolly, objected to their proceeding
farther without rest and refreshment,
as they had already travelled fifty miles
since morning; and he was sure his
uncle must be fatigued both in mind
and body, from vexation as well as
from a hard exercise, to which he
had not been accustomed. Fillet then
desisted, saying, he was sorry to find
the Captain had any cause for vexa∣tion;
but he hoped it was not an in∣curable
evil. This expression was ac∣companied
with a look of curiosity,
which Mr. Clarke was glad of an oc∣casion
to gratify; for, as we have
hinted above, he was a very commu∣nicative
gentleman, and the affair
which now lay upon his stomach in∣terested
him nearly. “I'll assure you,
Sir, (said he) this here gentleman,
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
captain Crowe, who is my mother's
own brother, has been cruelly used by
some of his relations. He bears as
good a character as any captain of a
ship on the Royal Exchange, and
has undergone a variety of hardships
at sea. What d'ye think, now, of
his bursting all his sinews, and making
his eyes start out of his head, in pul∣ling
his ship off a rock, whereby he
saved to his owners”—Here he was
interrupted by the Captain, who ex∣claimed,
“Belay, Tom Belay:—
prithee, don't veer out such a deal of
jaw. Clap a stopper on thy cable,
and bring thyself up, my lad.—
What a deal of stuff thou hast pump∣ed
up concerning bursting, and start∣ing,
and pulling ships, Laud have
mercy upon us!—Look ye here
brother—look ye here—mind these
poor crippled joints: two fingers on
the starboard, and three on the lar∣board
hand: crooked, d'ye see, like
the knees of a bilander.—I'll tell you
what, brother, you seem to be a—
ship deep laden—rich cargoe—cur∣rent
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
setting into the bay—hard gale
—lee shore—all hands in the boat—
tow round the headland—self pulling
for dear blood, against the whole crew.
—Snap go the finger-braces—crack
went the eye-blocks.—Bounce day∣light
—flash starlight—down I foun∣dered,
dark as hell—whizz went my
ears, and my head spun like a whir∣ligig.—
That don't signify—I'm a
Yorkshire boy, as the saying is—
all my life at sea, brother, by reason
of an old grandmother and maiden
aunt, a couple of old stinking—kept
me these forty years out of my grand∣father's
estate.—Hearing as how they
had taken their departure, came ashore,
hired horses, and clapped on all my
canvas, steering to the northward, to
take possession of my—But it don't
signify talking—these two old pirati∣cal—had
held a palaver with a lawyer
—an attorney, Tom, d'ye mind me,
an attorney—and by his assistance
hove me out of my inheritance:—
that is all, brother—hove me out of
five hundred pounds a year—that's
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
all—what signifies—but such wind∣falls
we don't every day pick up along
shore.—Fill about, brother—yes, by
the Lord! those two smuggling har∣ridans,
with the assistance of an attor∣ney—an
attorney, Tom—hove me
out of five hundred a year.” “Yes,
indeed, Sir, (added Mr. Clarke,) those
two malicious old women docked the
intail, and left the estate to an alien.”</P>
<P>Here Mr. Ferret thought proper to
intermingle in the conversation with a
“<HI>Pish,</HI> what, do'st talk of docking
the intail? Do'st not know that by
the Statute Westm. 2. 13 Ed. the will
and intention of the donor must be
fulfilled, and the tenant in <HI>tail</HI> shall
not alien after issue had, or before.”
“Give me leave, Sir, (replied Tom)
I presume you are a practitioner in the
law. Now you know, that in the case
of a contingent <HI>remainder,</HI> the intail
may be destroyed by levying a fine,
and suffering a recovery; or other∣wise
destroying the particular estate,
before the contingency happens. If
<HI>feoffees,</HI> who possess an estate only du∣ring
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
the life of a son, where divers
<HI>remainders</HI> are limited over, make a
<HI>feoffment</HI> in fee to him, by the <HI>feoff∣ment</HI>
all the future <HI>remainders</HI> are de∣stroyed.
Indeed, a person in <HI>remain∣der</HI>
may have a writ of Intrusion, if
any do intrude after the death of a
tenant for life; and the writ <HI>ex gravi
querela</HI> lies to execute a devise in <HI>re∣mainder,</HI>
after the death of tenant in
tail without issue.”—“Spoke like a
true disciple of Geber,” cries Ferrett.
“No, Sir, (replied Mr. Clarke) coun∣sellor
Caper is in the conveyancing-way—I
was clerk to serjeant Croaker.”
“Ay, now you may set up for your∣self;
(resumed the other) for you
can prate as unintelligibly as the best
of them.”</P>
<P>“Perhaps (said Tom) I do not
make myself understood: if so be as
how that is the case, let us change the
position; and suppose that this here
case is a <HI>tail after a possibility of issue
extinct.</HI> If a tenant in <HI>tail,</HI> after a
possibility, make a <HI>feoffment</HI> of his
land, he in reversion may enter for
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
the forfeiture. Then we must make
a distinction between <HI>general tail</HI> and
<HI>special tail.</HI> It is the word <HI>body</HI> that
makes the <HI>intail:</HI>—there must be
<HI>body</HI> in the <HI>tail,</HI> devised to heirs male
or female, otherwise it is a fee-simple,
because it is not limited of what <HI>body.</HI>
Thus a corporation cannot be seized in
<HI>tail.</HI> For example: here is a young
woman—What is your name, my
dear? “Dolly,” answered the daugh∣ter,
with a curtsy. “Here's Dolly—
I seize Dolly <HI>in tail</HI>—Dolly I seize
you in <HI>tail</HI>”—“Sha't then,” cried
Dolly, pouting. “I am seized of land
in fee—I settle on Dolly in <HI>tail.</HI>”—
Dolly, who did not comprehend the
nature of the illustration, understood
him in a literal sense, and in a whim∣pering
tone exclaimed, “Sha't then,
I tell thee, cursed tuoad!” Tom,
however, was so transported with his
subject, that he took no notice of poor
Dolly's mistake; but proceeded in his
harangue upon the different kinds of
<HI>tails, remainders,</HI> and <HI>seisins,</HI> when
he was interrupted by a noise that a∣larmed
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
the whole company. The
rain had been succeeded by a storm
of wind, that howled around the
house with the most savage impetuosi∣ty;
and the heavens were overcast
in such a manner, that not one star
appeared, so that all without was
darkness and uproar. This aggravated
the horror of divers loud screams,
which even the noise of the blast could
not exclude from the astonished ears
of our travellers. Capt. Crowe called
out, “Avast, avast:” Tom Clarke
sat silent, staring wildly, with his
mouth still open: the surgeon him∣self
seemed startled, and Ferret's coun∣tenance
betrayed evident marks of con∣fusion.
The ostler moved nearer the
chimney, and the good woman of
the house, with her two daughters,
crept close to the company.</P>
<P>After some pause, the Captain start∣ing
up, “These (said he) be signals
of distress. Some poor souls in dan∣ger
of foundering.—Let us bear up
a-head, and see if we can give them
any assistance.” The landlady begged
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
him, for Christis sake, not to think of
going out; for it was a spirit that
would lead him astray into fens and
rivers, and certainly do him a mischief.
Crowe seemed to be staggered by this
remonstrance, which his nephew rein∣forced,
observing, that it might be
a stratagem of rogues to decoy them
into the fields, that they might rob
them under cloud of night. Thus
exhorted, he resumed his seat; and
Mr. Ferret began to make very severe
strictures upon the folly and fear of
those who believed and trembled at
the visitation of spirits, ghosts, and
goblins. He said, he would engage
with twelve penny-worth of phospho∣rus
to frighten a whole parish out of
their senses: then he expatiated on the
pusillanimity of the nation in general;
ridiculed the militia, censured the go∣vernment;
and dropped some hints
about a change of hands, which
the Captain could not, and the Doc∣tor
would not comprehend. Tom
Clarke, from the freedom of his dis∣course,
concluded he was a ministe∣rial
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
spy, and communicated his opi∣nion
to his uncle in a whisper, while
this misanthrope continued to pour
forth his invectives with a fluency pe∣culiar
to himself. The truth is, Mr.
Ferret had been a party-writer, not
from principle, but employment, and
had felt the rod of power; in order
to avoid a second exertion of which,
he now found it convenient to sculk
about in the country: for he had re∣ceived
intimation of a warrant from
the secretary of state, who wanted to
be better acquainted with his person.
Notwithstanding the ticklish nature of
his situation, it was become so habi∣tual
to him to think and speak in a
certain manner, that even before stran∣gers,
whose principles and con∣nexions
he could not possibly know,
he hardly ever opened his mouth,
without uttering some direct or im∣plied
sarcasm against the govern∣ment.
He had already proceeded a
considerable way in demonstrating,
that the nation was bankrupt and beg∣gared,
and that those who stood at
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
the helm were steering full into the
gulph of inevitable destruction; when
his lecture was suddenly suspended by
a violent knocking at the door, which
threatened the whole house with im∣mediate
demolition. Capt. Crowe,
believing they should be instantly
boarded, unsheathed his hanger, and
stood in a posture of defence. Mr.
Fillet armed himself with the poker,
which happened to be red-hot: the
ostler pulled down a rusty firelock,
that hung by the roof, over a flitch
of bacon. Tom Clarke, perceiving
the landlady and her children distract∣ed
with terror, conducted them, out
of meer compassion, below stairs in∣to
the cellar; and as for Mr. Ferret,
he prudently withdrew into an adjoin∣ing
pantry. But as a personage of
great importance in this entertaining
history was forced to remain some
time at the door, before he could gain
admittance, so must the reader wait
with patience for the next chapter, in
which he will see the cause of this dis∣turbance
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
explained much to his com∣fort
and edification.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the hero of these adventures
makes his first appearance on the stage
of action.</HEAD>
<P>THE outward door of the Black
Lion had already sustained two
dreadful shocks; but at the third it
flew open, and in stalked an appari∣tion,
that smote the hearts of our tra∣vellers
with fear and trepidation. It
was the figure of a man armed cap-a-pie,
bearing on his shoulder a bun∣dle
dropping with water, which af∣terwards
appeared to be the body of
a man that seemed to have been
drowned, and fished up from the bot∣tom
of the neighbouring river. Hav∣ing
deposited his burthen carefully on
the floor, he addressed himself to the
company in these words: “Be not
surprised, good people, at this un∣usual
appearance, which I shall take
an opportunity to explain; and for∣give
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
the rude and boisterous manner
in which I have demanded, and in∣deed
forced admittance. The violence
of my intrusion was the effect of ne∣cessity.
In crossing the river, my
squire and his horse were swept away
by the stream; and with some diffi∣culty
I have been able to drag him
ashore, though I am afraid my assist∣ance
reached him too late: for, since
I brought him to land, he has given
no signs of life.” Here he was in∣terrupted
by a groan, which issued from
the chest of the squire, and terrified
the spectators as much as it comforted
the master. After some recollection,
Mr. Fillet began to undress the body,
which was laid in a blanket on the
floor, and rolled from side to side by
his direction. A considerable quan∣tity
of water being discharged from
the mouth of this unfortunate squire,
he uttered a hideous roar, and, open∣ing
his eyes, stared wildly around:
then the surgeon undertook for his re∣covery;
and his master went forth
with the ostler in quest of the horses,
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
which he had left by the side of the
river. His back was no sooner turn∣ed
than Ferret, who had been peep∣ing
from behind the pantry-door, ven∣tured
to rejoin the company; pro∣nouncing
with a smile, or rather grin
of contempt, “Hey day! what pre∣cious
mummery is this? What, are
we to have the farce of Hamlet's
ghost?” “Adzooks, (cried the Cap∣tain)
my kinsman Tom has dropped
a-stern—hope in God a-has not bulged
to, and gone to bottom.” “Pish,
(exclaimed the misanthrope) there's
no danger: the young lawyer is only
seizing Dolly in tail.”</P>
<P>Certain it is, Dolly squeaked at that
instant in the cellar; and Clarke ap∣pearing
soon after in some confusion,
declared she had been frightened by
a flash of lightning: but this assertion
was not confirmed by the young lady
herself, who eyed him with a sullen
regard, indicating displeasure, though
not indifference; and when questioned
by her mother, replied, “A-doan't
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
maind what a-says, so a-doan't, vor
all his goalden jacket, then.”</P>
<P>In the mean time the surgeon had
performed the operation of phlebo∣tomy
on the squire, who was lifted
into a chair, and supported by the
landlady for that purpose; but he
had not as yet given any sign of having
retrieved the use of his senses. And
here Mr. Fillet could not help con∣templating,
with surprize, the strange
figure and accoutrements of his patient,
who seemed in age to be turned of
fifty. His stature was below the mid∣dle
size: he was thick, squat, and
brawny, with a small protuberance
on one shoulder, and a prominent bel∣ly,
which, in consequence of the wa∣ter
he had swallowed, now strutted
beyond its usual dimensions. His
forehead was remarkably convex, and
so very low, that his black bushy hair
descended within an inch of his nose:
but this did not conceal the wrinkles
of his front, which were manifold.
His small glimmering eyes resembled
those of the Hampshire porker, that
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
turns up the soil with his projecting
snout. His cheeks were shrivelled
and puckered at the corners, like the
seams of a regimental coat as it comes
from the hands of the contracter: his
nose bore a strong analogy in shape to
a tennis-ball, and in colour to a mul∣berry;
for all the water of the river
had not been able to quench the na∣tural
fire of that feature. His upper
jaw was furnished with two long white
sharp pointed teeth or fangs, such as
the reader may have observed in the
chaps of a wolf, or full-grown mas∣tiff,
and an anatomist would describe
as a preternatural elongation of the
<HI>dentes canini.</HI> His chin was so long,
so peaked, and incurvated, as to form
in profile with his impending forehead
the exact resemblance of a moon in
the first quarter. With respect to his
equipage, he had a leathern cap upon
his head, faced like those worn by
marines, and exhibiting in embroidery
the figure of a crescent. His coat was
of white cloth faced with black, and
cut in a very antique fashion; and, in
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
lieu of a waistcoat, he wore a buff
jerkin. His feet were cased with loose
buskins, which, though they rose
almost to his knee, could not hide
that curvature known by the appella∣tion
of bandy legs. A large string of
bandaliers garnished a broad belt that
graced his shoulders, from whence
depended an instrument of war, which
was something between a back-sword
and a cutlass; and a case of pistols
were stuck in his girdle. Such was
the figure which the whole company
now surveyed with admiration. After
some pause, he seemed to recover his
recollection. He rolled about his eyes
around, and, attentively surveying
every individual, exclaimed, in a
strange tone, “Bodikins! where's
Gilbert?” This interrogation did
not savour much of sanity, especially
when accompanied with a wild stare,
which is generally interpreted as a
sure sign of a disturbed understand∣ing:
nevertheless, the surgeon endea∣voured
to assist his recollection.
“Come, (said he) have a good-heart.
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
—How do'st do, friend?” “Do!
(replied the squire) do as well as I
can:—that's a lie too: I might have
done better. I had no business to be
here.” “You ought to thank God
and your master (resumed the surgeon)
for the providential escape you have
had.” “Thank my master! (cried
the squire) thank the devil! Go and
teach your grannum to crack filberds.
I know who I'm bound to pray for,
and who I ought to curse the longest
day I have to live.”</P>
<P>Here the Captain interposing,
“Nay, brother, (said he) you are
bound to pray for this here gentleman
as your sheet-anchor: for, if so be
as he had not cleared your stowage of
the water you had taken in at your
upper works, and lightened your veins,
d'ye see, by taking away some of your
blood, adad! you had driven before
the gale, and never been brought up
in this world again, d'ye see.” “What,
then you would persuade me (replied
the patient) that the only way to save
my life was to shed my precious blood?
<PB N="25" REF="28"/>
Look ye, friend, it shall not be lost
blood to me.—I take you all to wit∣ness,
that there surgeon, or apothe∣cary,
or farrier, or dog-doctor, or
whatsoever he may be, has robbed
me of the balsam of life:—he has
not left so much blood in my body
as would fatten a starved flea.—O!
that there was a lawyer here to serve
him with a <HI>siserari.</HI>” Then fixing his
eyes upon Ferret, he proceeded:
“An't you a limb of the law, friend?
—No, I cry you mercy, you look
more like a shew-man or a conjurer.”
—Ferret, nettled at this address, an∣swered,
“It would be well for you
that I could conjure a little common
sense into that numbscull of yours.”
“If I want that commodity, (re∣joined
the squire) I must go to ano∣ther
market, I trow.—You legerde∣main
men be more like to conjure the
money from our pockets, than sense
into our sculls.—Vor my own part, I
was once cheated of vorty good shil∣lings
by one of your broother cups
and balls.” In all probability he

<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
would have descended to particulars,
had not he been seized with a return
of his nausea, which obliged him to
call for a bumper of brandy. This
remedy being swallowed, the tumult
in his stomach subsided. He desired
he might be put to-bed without de∣lay,
and that half a dozen eggs and a
pound of bacon might, in a couple of
hours, be dressed for his supper.</P>
<P>He was accordingly led off the
scene by the landlady and her daugh∣ter;
and Mr. Ferret had just time
to observe the fellow was a compo∣sition,
in which he did not know whe∣ther
knave or fool most predominated,
when the master returned from the
stable. He had taken off his helmet,
and now displayed a very engaging
countenance. His age did not seem
to exceed thirty: he was tall, and
seemingly robust; his face long and
oval, his nose aquiline, his mouth
furnished with a set of elegant teeth
white as the drifted snow; his com∣plexion
clear, and his aspect noble.
His chesnut hair loosely flowed in
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
short natural curls; and his grey eyes
shone with such vivacity, as plainly
shewed that his reason was a little dis∣composed.
Such an appearance pre-possessed
the greater part of the com∣pany
in his favour: he bowed round
with the most polite and affable ad∣dress;
enquired about his squire, and,
being informed of the pains Mr. Fil∣let
had taken for his recovery, insisted
upon that gentleman's accepting an
handsome gratuity: then, in conside∣ration
of the cold bath he had un∣dergone,
he was prevailed upon to
take the post of honour; namely,
the great chair fronting the fire, which
was reinforced with a billet of wood
for his comfort and convenience.</P>
<P>Perceiving his fellow-travellers ei∣ther
over-awed into silence by his pre∣sence,
or struck dumb with admira∣tion
at his equipage, he accosted them
in these words, while an agreeable
smile dimpled on his cheek.</P>
<P>“The good company wonders,
no doubt, to see a man cased in ar∣mour,
such as hath been for above
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
a whole century disused in this and
every other country of Europe; and
perhaps they will be still more sur∣prised,
when they hear that man pro∣fess
himself a noviciate of that mi∣litary
order, which hath of old been
distinguished in Great-Britain, as well
as through all Christendom, by the
name of Knights Errant. Yes, gen∣tlemen,
in that painful and thorny
path of toil and danger I have begun
my career, a candidate for honest
fame; determined, as far as in me
lies, to honour and assert the efforts
of virtue; to combat vice in all her
forms, redress injuries, chastise op∣pression,
protect the helpless and for∣lorn,
relieve the indigent, exert
my best endeavours in the cause of
innocence and beauty, and dedicate
my talents, such as they are, to the
service of my country.” “What!
(said Ferret) you set up for a modern
Don Quixote?—The scheme is rather
too stale and extravagant.—What was
an humorous romance, and well-timed
satire in Spain, near two hun∣dred
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
years ago, will make but a sorry
jest, and appear equally insipid and
absurd, when really acted from affec∣tation,
at this time a-day, in a coun∣try
like England.”</P>
<P>The Knight, eying this censor with
a look of disdain, replied, in a solemn
lofty tone: “He that from affectation
imitates the extravagancies recorded
of Don Quixote, is an impostor equally
wicked and contemptible. He that
counterfeits madness, unless he dis∣sembles
like the elder Brutus, for
some virtuous purpose, not only de∣bases
his own soul, but acts as a trai∣tor
to heaven, by denying the divinity
that is within him—I am neither an
affected imitator of Don Quixote,
nor, as I trust in heaven, visited by
that spirit of lunacy so admirably dis∣played
in the fictitious character exhi∣bited
by the inimitable Cervantes. I
have not yet encountered a windmill
for a giant; nor mistaken this public
house for a magnificent castle: nei∣ther
do I believe this gentleman to
be the constable; nor that worthy
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
practitioner to be master Elizabat,
the surgeon recorded in Amadis de
Gaul; nor you to be the enchanter
Alquife, nor any other sage of his∣tory
or romance.—I see and distin∣guish
objects as they are discerned
and described by other men. I rea∣son
without prejudice, can endure
contradiction, and, as the company
perceives, even bear impertinent cen∣sure
without passion or resentment.
I quarrel with none but the foes of
virtue and decorum, against whom I
have declared perpetual war, and
them I will every where attack as the
natural enemies of mankind.” “But
that war (said the cynic) may soon be
brought to a conclusion, and your
adventures close in Bridewell, pro∣vided
you meet with some determined
constable, who will seize your wor∣ship
as a vagrant, according to the
statute.” “Heaven and earth! (cried
the stranger, starting up and laying
his hand to his sword) do I live to
hear myself insulted with such an op∣probrious
epithet, and refrain from
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
trampling into dust the insolent calum∣niator!”</P>
<P>The tone in which these words
were pronounced, and the indigna∣tion
that flashed from the eyes of
the speaker, intimidated every indivi∣dual
of the society, and reduced Fer∣ret
to a temporary privation of all his
faculties. His eyes retired within
their sockets: his complexion, which
was naturally of a copper hue, now
shifted to a leaden colour; his teeth
began to chatter; and all his limbs
were agitated by a sudden palsy. The
Knight observed his condition, and
resumed his feat, saying, “I was to
blame: my vengeance must be re∣served
for very different objects.—
Friend, you have nothing to fear—the
sudden gust of passion is now blown
over. Recollect yourself, and I will
reason calmly on the observation you
have made.”</P>
<P>This was a very seasonable decla∣ration
to Mr. Ferret, who opened his
eyes, and wiped his forehead, while
the other proceeded in these terms.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37"/>
“You say I am in danger of being
apprehended as a vagrant: I am not
so ignorant of the laws of my coun∣try,
but that I know the description
of those who fall within the legal
meaning of this odious term. You
must give me leave to inform you,
friend, that I am neither bearward,
fencer, stroller, gipsey, mountebank,
nor mendicant; nor do I practise sub∣tle
craft to deceive and impose upon
the King's lieges; nor can I be held
as an idle disorderly person, travelling
from place to place, collecting monies
by virtue of counterfeited passes, briefs,
and other false pretences—In what
respect therefore am I to be deemed
a vagrant? Answer boldly, without
fear or scruple.” To this interroga∣tion
the misanthrope replied, with
a faultering accent, “If not a va∣grant,
you incur the penalty for rid∣ing
armed in affray of the peace.”
“But, instead of riding armed in
affray of the peace, (resumed the
other) I ride in preservation of the
peace; and gentlemen are allowed
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
by the law to wear armour for their
defence. Some ride with blunder-busses,
some with pistols, some with
swords, according to their various in∣clinations.
Mine is to wear the ar∣mour
of my forefathers: perhaps I
use them for exercise, in order to ac∣custom
myself to fatigue, and strength∣en
my constitution: perhaps I assume
them for a frolick.”</P>
<P>“But if you swagger armed and
in disguise, assault me on the high∣way,
or put me in bodily fear, for
the sake of the jest, the law will pu∣nish
you in earnest,” (cried the other.)
“But my intention (answered the
Knight) is carefully to avoid all those
occasions of offences.” “Then (said
Ferret) you may go unarmed, like
other sober people.” “Not so, (an∣swered
the Knight) as I propose to
travel all times, and in all places, mine
armour may guard me against the at∣tempts
of treachery: it may defend
me in combat against odds, should I be
assaulted by a multitude of plebeians,
or have occasion to bring malefactors
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
to justice.” “What, then (exclaimed
the philosopher) you intend to co∣operate
with the honourable frater∣nity
of thief-takers?” “I do pur∣pose
(said the youth, eying him with
a look of ineffable contempt) to act
as a coadjutor to the law, and even to
remedy evils which the law cannot
reach; to detect fraud and treason,
abase insolence, mortify pride, dis∣courage
slander, disgrace immodesty,
and stigmatize ingratitude: but the
infamous part of a thief-catcher's cha∣racter
I disclaim. I neither associate
with robbers and pickpockets, know∣ing
them to be such, that, in being
intrusted with their secrets, I may the
more effectually betray them; nor
shall I ever pocket the reward granted
by the legislature to those by whom
robbers are brought to conviction:
but I shall always think it my duty
to rid my country of that pernicious
vermin, which preys upon the bowels
of the commonwealth—not but that
an incorporated company of licensed
thieves might, under proper regula∣tions,
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
be of service to the commu∣nity.”</P>
<P>Ferret, emboldened by the passive
tameness with which the stranger
bore his last reflection, began to think
he had nothing of Hector but his
outside, and gave a loose to all the acri∣mony
of his party-rancour. Hear∣ing
the Knight mention a company of
licensed thieves, “What else (cried
he) is the majority of the nation?
What is your standing army at home,
that eat up their fellow subjects?
What are your mercenaries abroad,
whom you hire to fight their own
quarrels? What is your militia, that
wise measure of this sagacious m—ry,
but a larger gang of petty thieves,
who steal sheep and poultry through
mere idleness; and were they con∣fronted
with an enemy, would steal
themselves away? What is your…..
but a knot of thieves, who pillage
the nation under colour of law, and
enrich themselves with the wreck of
their country? When you consider
the enormous debt of an hundred
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
millions, the intolerable load of taxes
and impositions under which we groan,
and the manner in which that burthen
is yearly accumulating, to support two
German electorates, without our re∣ceiving
any thing in return but the
shews of triumph and shadows of
conquest: I say, when you reflect on
these circumstances, and at the same
time behold our cities filled with bank∣rupts,
and our country with beggars;
can you be so infatuated as to deny
that our m—y is mad, or worse than
mad; our wealth exhausted, our peo∣ple
miserable, our credit blasted, and
our state on the brink of perdition?
This prospect, indeed, will make the
fainter impression, if we recollect that
we ourselves are a pack of such pro∣fligate,
corrupted, pusillanimous ras∣cals,
as deserve no salvation.”</P>
<P>The stranger, raising his voice to
a loud tone, replied, “Such, indeed,
are the insinuations, equally false and
insidious, with which the desperate
emissaries of a party endeavour to
poison the minds of his Majesty's
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
subjects, in defiance of common ho∣nesty
and common sense. But he
must be blind to all perception, and
dead to candour, who does not see
and own that we are involved in a
just and necessary war, which has been
maintained on truly British principles,
prosecuted with vigour, and crowned
with success; that our taxes are easy,
in proportion to our wealth; that our
conquests are equally glorious and
important; that our commerce flou∣rishes,
our people are happy, and
our enemies reduced to despair.—Is
there a man who boasts a British heart,
that repines at the success and prospe∣rity
of his country? Such there are,
O shame to patriotism, and reproach
to Great-Britain! who act as the e∣missaries
of France both in word and
writing; who exaggerate our neces∣sary
burthens, magnify our dangers,
extol the power of our enemies, de∣ride
our victories, extenuate our con∣quests,
condemn the measures of our
government, and scatter the seeds of
dissatisfaction through the land. Such
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
domestic traitors are doubly the ob∣jects
of detestation; first, in pervert∣ing
truth; and secondly, in propagat∣ing
falsehood, to the prejudice of that
community of which they have pro∣fessed
themselves members. One of
these is well known by the name of
Ferret, an old, rancorous, incorrigi∣ble
instrument of sedition: happy
it is for him, that he has never fallen
in my way; for, notwithstanding the
maxims of forbearance which I have
adopted, the indignation which the
character of that caitiff inspires, would
probably impel me to some act of vio∣lence,
and I should crush him like an
ungrateful viper, that gnawed the
bosom which warmed it into life!”</P>
<P>These last words were pronounced
with a wildness of look, that even
bordered upon frenzy. The misan∣thrope
once more retired to the pan∣try
for shelter, and the rest of the
guests were evidently disconcerted.</P>
<P>Mr. Fillet, in order to change the
conversation, which was likely to
produce serious consequences, expres∣sed
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
uncommon satisfaction at the re∣marks
which the Knight had made,
signified his approbation of the ho∣nourable
office he had undertaken;
declared himself happy in having
seen such an accomplished cavalier;
and observed, that nothing was want∣ing
to render him a complete knight∣errant,
but some celebrated beauty,
the mistress of his heart, whose idea
might animate his breast, and strength∣en
his arm to the utmost exertion of
valour: he added, that love was the
soul of chivalry. The stranger start∣ed
at this discourse. He turned his
eyes on the surgeon with a fixed re∣gard:
his countenance changed: a
torrent of tears gushed down his
cheeks: his head sunk upon his bo∣som:
he heaved a profound sigh; and
remained in silence with all the ex∣ternal
marks of unutterable sorrow.
The company were in some measure
infected by his despondence; con∣cerning
the cause of which, however,
they would not venture to inquire.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="45"/>
By this time the landlady, having
disposed of the squire, desired to
know, with many curtsies, if his honour
would not chuse to put off his wet
garments; assuring him, that she had
a very good feather-bed at his service,
upon which many gentlevolks of the
virst quality had lain; that the sheets
were well aired; and that Dolly should
warm them for his worship with a pan
of coals. This hospitable offer be∣ing
repeated, he seemed to wake from
a trance of grief; arose from his seat,
and, bowing courteously to the com∣pany,
withdrew.</P>
<P>Captain Crowe, whose faculty of
speech had been all this time absorbed
in amazement, now broke into the
conversation with a volley of inter∣jections:
“Split my snatchblock!—Odd's
firkin!—Splice my old shoes!—I
have sailed the salt seas, brother,
since I was no higher than the Tri∣ton's
taffril—east, west, north, and
south, as the saying is—Blacks, In∣dians,
Moors, Morattos, and Seapoys;—but,
smite my timbers! such a man
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
of war—” Here he was interrupted
by his nephew Tom Clarke, who
had disappeared at the Knight's first
entrance, and now produced himself
with an eagerness in his look, while
the tears started in his eyes.—“Lord
bless my soul! (cried he) I know that
gentleman, and his servant, as well
as I know my own father.—I am his
own godson, uncle: he stood for me
when he was a boy—yes, indeed, Sir,
my father was steward to the estate—I
may say I was bred up in the family
of Sir Everhard Greaves, who has
been dead these two years—this is the
only son, Sir Launcelot; the best-na∣tured,
worthy, generous gentleman—I
care not who knows it: I love
him as well as if he was my own flesh
and blood—”</P>
<P>At this period Tom, whose heart
was of the melting mood, began to
sob and weep plenteously, from pure
affection. Crowe, who was not very
subject to these tendernesses, damned
him for a chicken-hearted lubber; re∣peating,
with much peevishness, “What
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
do'st cry for? What do'st cry for, nod∣dy?”
The surgeon, impatient to know
the story of Sir Launcelot, which he
had heard imperfectly recounted, beg∣ged
that Mr. Clarke would compose
himself, and relate it as circumstantially
as his memory could retain the particu∣lars;
and Tom, wiping his eyes, pro∣mised
to give him that satisfaction;
which the reader, if he be so minded,
may partake in the next chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which the reader, on perusal, may wish
were chapter the last.</HEAD>
<P>THE Doctor prescribed a <HI>repeta∣tur</HI>
of the julep, and mixed the
ingredients <HI>secundem artem;</HI> Tom
Clarke hemmed thrice, to clear his
pipes; while the rest of the com∣pany,
including Dolly and her mo∣ther,
who had by this time admi∣nistred
to the knight, composed them∣selves
into earnest and hushed atten∣tion.
Then the young lawyer began
his narration to this effect:—“I tell
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
ye what, gemmen, I don't pretend
in this here case to flourish and ha∣rangue
like a—having never been
called to—but what of that, d'ye
see?—perhaps I may know as much
as—Facts are facts, as the saying
is.—I shall tell, repeat, and relate a
plain story—matters of fact, d'ye see,
without rhetoric, oratory, ornament,
or embellishment; without repetition,
tautology, circumlocution, or going
about the bush: facts which I shall
aver, partly on the testimony of my
own knowledge, and partly from the
information of responsible evidences of
good repute and credit, any circum∣stance
known to the contrary notwith∣standing:—for,
as the law saith, if
so be as how there is <HI>an exception</HI> to
evidence, that <HI>exception</HI> is in its na∣ture
but a denial of what is taken to
be good by the other party, and <HI>ex∣ceptio
in non exceptis, firmat regulam,</HI>
d'ye see.—But, howsomever, in re∣gard
to this here affair, we need not
be so scrupulous as if we were plead∣ing
before a judge <HI>sedente curia</HI>—”</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="49"/>
Ferret, whose curiosity was rather
more eager than that of any other
person in this audience, being pro∣voked
by this preamble, dashed the
pipe he had just filled in pieces against
the grate; and after having pro∣nounced
the interjection <HI>pish,</HI> with
an acrimony of aspect altogether pe∣culiar
to himself, “If (said he) im∣pertinence
and folly were felony by
the statute, there would be no want
of unexceptionable evidence to hang
such an eternal babbler.” “Anan,
babbler! (cried Tom, reddening with
passion, and starting up) I'd have you
to know, Sir, that I can bite as well
as babble; and that, if I am so mind∣ed,
I can run upon the foot after my
game without being in fault, as the
saying is; and which is more, I can
shake an old fox by the collar.”</P>
<P>How far this young lawyer might
have proceeded to prove himself
staunch on the person of the misan∣thrope,
if he had not been prevented,
we shall not determine; but the
whole company were alarmed at his
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
looks and expressions. Dolly's rosy
cheeks assumed an ash-colour, while
she ran between the disputants, cry∣ing,
“Naay, naay—vor the love of
God doant then, doan't then!” But
captain Crowe exerted a parental au∣thority
over his nephew, saying, A∣vast,
Tom, avast!—Snugg's the
word—we'll have no boarding, d'ye
see.—Haul forward thy chair again,
take thy berth, and proceed with thy
story in a direct course, without yaw∣ing
like a Dutch yanky.”</P>
<P>Tom, thus tutored, recollected
himself, resumed his seat, and, after
some pause, plunged at once into the
current of narration. “I told you
before, gemmen, that the gentle∣man
in armour was the only son of
Sir Everhard Greaves, who possessed
a free estate of five thousand a year in
our county, and was respected by all
his neighbours, as much for his per∣sonal
merit as for his family fortune.
With respect to his son Launcelot,
whom you have seen, I can remem∣ber
nothing until he returned from the
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
university, about the age of seventeen,
and then I myself was not more than
ten years old. The young gemman
was at that time in mourning for his
mother; though God he knows, Sir
Everhard had more cause to rejoice
than to be afflicted at her death:—
for, among friends, (here he lowered
his voice, and looked round the
kitchen) she was very whimsical, ex∣pensive,
and ill-tempered, and, I'm
afraid, a little—upon the—flighty
order—a little touched or so;—but
mum for that—the lady is now dead;
and it is my maxim, <HI>de mortuis nil
nisi bonum.</HI> The young squire was
even then very handsome, and looked
remarkably well in his weepers: but
he had an aukward air and sham∣bling
gait, stooped mortally, and
was so shy and silent, that he would
not look a stranger in the face, nor
open his mouth before company.
Whenever he spied a horse or car∣riage
at the gate, he would make his
escape into the garden, and from
thence into the park; where many's
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
the good time and often he has been
found sitting under a tree, with a
book in his hand, reading Greek,
Latin, and other foreign linguas.</P>
<P>Sir Everhard himself was no great
scholar, and my father had forgot his
classical learning; and so the rector of
the parish was desired to examine
young Launcelot. It was a long time
before he found an opportunity: the
squire always gave him the slip.—
At length the parson catched him in
bed of a morning, and, locking the
door, to it they went tooth and nail.
What passed betwixt them the Lord in
heaven knows; but, when the Doctor
came forth, he looked wild and hag∣gard
as if he had seen a ghost, his
face as white as paper, and his lips
trembling like an aspen-leaf. “Par∣son,
(said the knight) what is the
matter?—how do'st find my son? I
hope he won't turn out a ninny, and
disgrace his family.” The Doctor,
wiping the sweat from his forehead,
replied, with some hesitation, “he
could not tell—he hoped the best—
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
the squire was to be sure a very ex∣traordinary
young gentleman”—
But the father urging him to give
an explicit answer, he frankly declar∣ed,
that, in his opinion, the son
would turn out either a mirrour of
wisdom, or a monument of folly:
for his genius and disposition were al∣together
preternatural. The knight
was sorely vexed at this declaration,
and signified his displeasure by saying,
the doctor, like a true priest, dealt in
mysteries and oracles, that would ad∣mit
of different and indeed contrary
interpretations. He afterwards con∣sulted
my father, who had served as
steward upon the estate for above thirty
years, and acquired a considerable
share of his favour. “Will. Clarke,
(said he, with tears in his eyes) what
shall I do with this unfortunate lad?
I would to God he had never been
born; for I fear he will bring my
grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.
When I am gone, he will throw
away the estate, and bring himself
to infamy and ruin by keeping com∣pany
<PB N="49" REF="54"/>
with rooks and beggars.—O
Will! I could forgive extravagance
in a young man; but it breaks my
heart to see my only son give such
repeated proofs of a mean spirit and
sordid disposition!”</P>
<P>Here the old gentleman shed a
flood of tears, and not without some
shadow of reason. By this time
Launcelot was grown so reserved to
his father, that he seldom saw him,
or any of his relations, except when
he was in a manner forced to appear
at table, and there his bashfulness
seemed every day to encrease. On
the other hand, he had formed some
very strange connexions. Every morn∣ing
he visited the stable, where he
not only conversed with the grooms
and helpers, but scraped acquaintance
with the horses: he fed his favourites
with his own hand, stroaked, caressed,
and rode them by turns; till at last
they grew so familiar, that, even when
they were a-field at grass, and saw
him at a distance, they would toss
their manes, whinny like so many
<PB N="50" REF="55"/>
colts at sight of the dam, and, gal∣loping
up to the place where he stood,
smell him all over.—You must
know that I myself, though a child,
was his companion in all these excur∣sions.
He took a liking to me on ac∣count
of my being his godson, and
gave me more money than I knew
what to do with: he had always plen∣ty
of cash for the asking, as my fa∣ther
was ordered to supply him libe∣rally,
the knight thinking that a com∣mand
of money might help to raise
his thoughts to a proper consideration
of his own importance. He never
could endure a common beggar, that
was not either in a state of infancy
or of old age: but, in other respects,
he made the guineas fly in such a
manner, as looked more like mad∣ness
than generosity. He had no
communication with your rich yeo∣men;
but rather treated them and
their families with studied contempt,
because forsooth they pretended to
assume the dress and manners of the
gentry: they kept their footmen,
<PB N="51" REF="56"/>
their saddle-horses, and chaises: their
wives and daughters appeared in
their jewels, their silks, and their
sattins, their negligees and trollo∣pees:
their clumsy shanks, like so
many shins of beef, were cased in
silk-hose and embroidered slippers:
their raw red fingers, gross as the
pipes of a chamber-organ, which had
been employed in milking the cows,
in twirling the mop or churn-staff,
being adorned with diamonds, were
taught to thrum the pandola, and
even to touch the keys of the harpsi∣chord:
nay, in every village they kept
a rout and set up an assembly; and
in one place a hog-butcher was ma∣ster
of the ceremonies. I have heard
Mr. Greaves ridicule them for their
vanity and aukward imitation; and
therefore, I believe, he avoided all
concerns with them, even when they
endeavoured to engage his attention.
It was the lower sort of people with
whom he chiefly conversed, such as
ploughmen, ditchers, and other day-labourers.
To every cottager in the
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
parish he was a bounteous benefactor.
He was, in the literal sense of the
word, a careful overseer of the poor;
for he went from house to house, in∣dustriously
inquiring into the distresses
of the people. He repaired their
huts, cloathed their backs, filled their
bellies, and supplied them with ne∣cessaries
for exercising their industry
and different occupations.</P>
<P>I'll give you one instance now, as
a specimen of his character. He and
I, strolling one day on the side of a
common, saw two boys picking hips
and haws from the hedges, one seem∣ed
to be about five, and the other a
year older: they were both barefoot
and ragged; but at the same time fat,
fair, and in good condition. “Who
do you belong to?” (said Mr. Greaves.)
“To Mary Stile, (replied the oldest)
the widow that rents one of them
housen.” “And how do'st live, my
boy? Thou lookest fresh and jolly;”
resumed the squire. “Lived well
enough till yesterday,” answered the
child. “And pray what happened
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
yesterday, my boy?” continued Mr.
Greaves. “Happened! (said he)
why, mammy had a coople of lit∣tle
Welch keawes, that gi'en milk
enough to fill all our bellies; mam∣my's,
and mine, and Dick's here,
and my two little sisters at hoam:
yesterday the squire seized the keawes
for rent, God rot'un! Mammy's
gone to bed sick and sulky: my
two sisters be crying at hoam vor
vood; and Dick and I be come hi∣ther
to pick haws and bullies.”—
My godfather's face grew red as
scarlet: he took one of the children
in either hand, and leading them
towards the house, found Sir Everhard
talking with my father before
the gate. Instead of avoiding the
old gentleman, as usual, he brushed
up to him with a spirit he had ne∣ver
shewn before, and presenting
the two ragged boys, “Surely, Sir,
(said he) you will not countenance
that there ruffian your steward, in
oppressing the widow and the father∣less.
On pretence of distraining for
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
the rent of a cottage, he has robbed
the mother of these and other poor
infant-orphans of two cows, which
afforded them their whole suste∣nance.
Shall you be concerned in
tearing the hard-earned morsel from
the mouth of indigence? Shall your
name, which has been so long men∣tioned
as a blessing, be now detested
as a curse by the poor, the helpless,
and forlorn? The father of these
babes was once your game-keeper,
who died of a consumption caught
in your service.—You see they are
almost naked—I found them pluck∣ing
haws and sloes, in order to ap∣pease
their hunger.—The wretched
mother is starving in a cold cottage,
distracted with the cries of other two
infants, clamerous for food; and
while her heart is bursting with an∣guish
and despair, she invokes heaven
to avenge the widow's cause upon the
head of her unrelenting landlord!”</P>
<P>This unexpected address brought
tears into the eyes of the good old
gentleman. “Will Clarke, (said
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
he to my father) how durst you
abuse my authority at this rate?
You who know I have been always
a protector, not an oppressor of the
needy and unfortunate. I charge
you, go immediately and comfort
this poor woman with immediate
relief: instead of her own cows, let
her have two of the best milch cows
of my dairy: they shall graze in my
parks in summer, and be foddered
with my hay in winter.—She shall
sit rent-free for life; and I will take
care of these her poor orphans.”
This was a very affecting scene.
Mr. Launcelot took his father's hand
and kissed it, while the tears ran
down his cheeks; and Sir Everha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
embraced his son with great tender∣ness,
crying, “My dear boy! God
be praised for having given you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a feeling heart.” My fath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
self was moved, thof a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
of the law, and consequent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
to distresses.—He declared, that he
had given no directions to distrain;
and that the bailiff must have done
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
it by his own authority.—“If that
be the case (said the young squire)
let the inhuman rascal be turned out
of our service.”</P>
<P>Well, gemmen, all the children
were immediately cloathed and fed,
and the poor widow had well nigh
run distracted with joy. The old
knight, being of a humane temper
himself, was pleased to see such
proofs of his son's generosity: he
was not angry at his spending his
money, but at squandering away his
time among the dregs of the people.
For you must know, he not only
made matches, portioned poor mai∣dens,
and set up young couples that
came together without money; but
he mingled in every rustic diversion,
and bore away the prize in every
contest. He excelled every swain
of that district in feats of strength
and activity; in leaping, running,
wrestling, cricket, cudgel-playing,
and pitching the bar; and was con∣fessed
to be, out of sight, the best
dancer at all wakes and holidays:
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
happy was the country-girl who
could engage the young squire as
her partner! To be sure it was a
comely sight for to see as how the
buxom country-lasses, fresh and fra∣grant,
and blushing like the rose, in
their best apparel dight, their white
hose, and clean short dimity petti∣coats,
their gaudy gowns of print∣ed
cotton; their top-knots, kissing-strings,
and stomachers, bedizened
with bunches of ribbons of various
colours, green, pink, and yellow;
to see them crowned with garlands,
and assembled on May-day, to dance
before squire Launcelot, as he made
his morning's progress through the
village. Then all the young pea∣sants
made their appearance with
cockades, suited to the fancies of
their several sweet-hearts, and boughs
of flowering hawthorn. The chil∣dren
sported about like flocks of
frisking lambs, or the young fry
swarming under the sunny bank of
some meandering river. The old
men and women, in their holiday-garments,
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
stood at their doors to
receive their benefactor, and poured
forth blessings on him as he passed:
the children welcomed him with
their shrill shouts; the damsels with
songs of praise; and the young men
with the pipe and tabor marched
before him to the May-pole, which
was bedecked with flowers and
bloom. There the rural dance be∣gan:
a plentiful dinner, with oceans
of good liquor, was bespoke at the
White Hart: the whole village was
rega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at the squire's expence; and
both the day and the night was spent
in mirth and pleasure. Lord help
you! he could not rest if he thought
there was an aching heart in the
whole parish. Every paultry cottage
was in a little time converted into
a pretty snug, comfortable habita∣tion,
with a wooden porch at the
door, glass casements in the win∣dows,
and a little garden behind
well stored with greens, roots, and
sallads. In a word, the poor's rate
was reduced to a meer trifle, and
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
one would have thought the golden
age was revived in Yorkshire. But,
as I told you before, the old knight
could not bear to see his only son so
wholly attached to these lowly plea∣sures,
while he industriously shunned
all opportunities of appearing in that
superior sphere to which he was de∣signed
by nature and by fortune.
He imputed his conduct to meanness
of spirit, and advised with my father
touching the properest expedient to
wean his affections from such low-born
pursuits. My father counselled him
to send the young gentleman up to
London, to be entered as a student in
the Temple, and recommended to the
superintendance of some person who
knew the town, and might engage
him insensibly in such amusements
and connexions, as would soon lift his
ideas above the humble objects on
which they had been hitherto em∣ployed.
This advice appeared so sa∣lutary,
that it was followed with∣out
the least hesitation. The young
squire himself was perfectly well sa∣tisfied
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
with the proposal, and in a
few days set out for the great city:
but there was not a dry eye in the
parish at his departure, although he
prevailed upon his father to pay in
his absence all the pensions he had
granted to those who could not live
on the fruit of their own industry.
In what manner he spent his time at
London, it is none of my business to
inquire; thos I know pretty well
what kind of lives are led by gem∣men
of your Inns of Court.—I my∣self
once belonged to Serjeant's Inn,
and was perhaps as good a wit and
a critick as any Templar of them all.
Nay, as for that matter, thof I de∣spise
vanity, I can aver with a safe
conscience, that I had once the ho∣nour
to belong to the society called
<HI>the Town:</HI> we were all of us attor∣neys
clerks, gemmen, and had our
meetings at an ale-house in Butcher∣row,
where we regulated the diver∣sions
of the theatre.</P>
<P>But to return from this digression:
Sir Everhard Greaves did not seem
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
to be very well pleased with the con∣duct
of his son at London. He got
notice of some irregularities and scrapes
into which he had fallen; and the
squire seldom wrote to his father, ex∣cept
to draw upon him for money,
which he did so fast, that in eighteen
months the old gemman lost all pa∣tience.</P>
<P>At this period squire Darnel chanced
to die, leaving an only daughter, a
minor, heiress of three thousand a year,
under the guardianship of her uncle
Anthony, whose brutal character all
the world knows. The breath was
no sooner out of his brother's body
than he resolved, if possible, to suc∣ceed
him in parliament as represen∣tative
for the borough of Ashenton.
Now you must know, that this
borough had been for many years a
bone of contention between the fa∣milies
of Greaves and Darnel; and at
length the difference was compro∣mised
by the interposition of friends,
on condition that Sir Everhard and
Squire Darnel should alternately re∣present
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
the place in parliament. They
agreed to this compromise for their
mutual convenience; but they were
never heartily reconciled. Their po∣litical
principles did not tally; and
their wives looked upon each other as
rivals in fortune and magnificence:
so that there was no intercourse be∣tween
them, thof they lived in the
same neighbourhood. On the con∣trary,
in all disputes, they constantly
headed the opposite parties. Sir Everhard
understanding that Anthony Dar∣nel
had begun to canvass, and was
putting every iron in the fire, in vio∣lation
and contempt of the <HI>pactum fa∣miliae</HI>
before mentioned, fell into a
violent passion, that brought on a
severe fit of the gout, by which he
was disabled from giving personal at∣tention
to his own interest. My father,
indeed, employed all his diligence and
address, and spared neither money,
time, nor constitution, till at length he
drank himself into a consumption,
which was the death of him. But,
after all, there is a great difference
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
between a steward and a principal.
Mr. Darnel attended in <HI>propria persona,</HI>
flattered and caressed the women,
feasted the electors, hired mobs, made
processions, and scattered about his
money in such a manner, that our
friends durst hardly shew their heads
in public.</P>
<P>At this very crisis our young squire,
to whom his father had writ an account
of the transaction, arrived unexpect∣edly
at Greavesbury-hall, and had a
long private conference with Sir Everhard.
The news of his return spread
like wild-fire thro' all that part of the
country: bonfires were made, and the
bells set a ringing in several towns and
steeples; and next morning above
seven hundred people were assembled
at the gate, with music, flags and
streamers, to welcome their young
squire, and accompany him to the
borough of Ashenton. He set out on
foot with this retinue, and entered
one end of the town just as Mr. Dar∣nel's
mob had come in at the other.
Both arrived about the same time at
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
the market-place; but Mr. Darnel,
mounting first into the balcony of
the town-house, made a long speech
to the people in favour of his own
pretensions, not without some invi∣dious
reflections glanced at Sir Everhard,
his competitor. We did not
much mind the acclamations of his
party, which we knew had been
hired for the purpose: but we were
in some pain for Mr. Greaves, who
had not been used to speak in pub∣lic.
He took his turn however in
the balcony, and, uncovering his
head, bowed all round with the most
engaging courtesy. He was dressed
in a green frock trimmed with gold,
and his own dark hair flowed about
his ears in natural curls, while his
face was overspread with a blush,
that improved the glow of youth to
a deeper crimson, and I dare say set
many a female heart a palpitating.
When he made his first appearance,
there was just such a humming and
clapping of hands as you may have
heard when the celebrated Garrick
<PB N="65" REF="70"/>
comes upon the stage in King Lear,
or King Richard, or any other top
character. But how agreeably were
we disappointed, when our young
gentleman made such an oration as
would not have disgraced a Pitt, an
Egmont, or a Murray! While he
spoke, all was hushed in admiration
and attention—you could have al∣most
heard a feather drop to the
ground. It would have charmed
you to hear with what modesty he
recounted the services which his fa∣ther
and grandfather had done to
the corporation; with what eloquence
he expatiated upon the shameful in∣fraction
of the treaty subsisting be∣tween
the two families; and with
what keen and spirited strokes of satire
he retorted the sarcasms of Darnel.
He no sooner concluded his harangue,
than there was such a burst of applause
as seemed to rend the very sky. Our
musick immediately struck up; our
people advanced with their ensigns,
and, as every man had a good cud∣gel,
broken heads would have en∣sued,
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
had not Mr. Darnel and his
party thought proper to retreat with
uncommon dispatch. He never of∣fered
to make another public en∣trance,
as he saw the torrent ran so
violently against him; but sat down
with his loss, and withdrew his op∣position,
though at bottom extreme∣ly
mortified and incensed. Sir Ever∣hard
was unanimously elected, and
appeared to be the happiest man
upon earth; for, besides the plea∣sure
arising from his victory over this
competitor, he was now fully satisfied
that his son, instead of disgracing,
would do honour to his family. It
would have moved a heart of stone,
to see with what a tender transport
of paternal joy he received his dear
Launcelot, after having heard of his
deportment and success at Ashenton;
where, by the bye, he gave a ball to
the ladies, and displayed as much ele∣gance
and politeness as if he had been
bred at the court of Versailles.</P>
<P>This joyous season was of short
duration: in a little time all the hap∣piness
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
of the family was overcast by
a sad incident, which hath left such
an unfortunate impression upon the
mind of the young gentleman, as, I
am afraid, will never be effaced.
Mr. Darnel's niece and ward, the
great heiress, whose name is Aurelia,
was the most celebrated beauty of the
whole country—if I said the whole
kingdom, or indeed all Europe, per∣haps
I should barely do her justice.
I don't pretend to be a limner, gem∣men;
nor does it become me to de∣lineate
such excellence: but surely I
may presume to repeat from the play;
<Q><L>“O! she is all that painting can
express,</L>
<L>“Or youthful poets fancy when
they love!</L></Q></P>
<P>At that time she might be about
seventeen, tall and fair, and so ex∣quisitely
shaped—you may talk of
your Venus de Medicis, your Dianas,
your Nymphs, and Galateas; but if
Praxiteles, and Roubillac, and Wil∣ton,
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
were to lay their heads toge∣ther,
in order to make a complete
pattern of beauty, they would hard∣ly
reach her model of perfection.—As
for complexion, poets will talk
of blending the lily with the rose,
and bring in a parcel of similes of
cowslips, carnations, pinks, and dai∣sies.—There's
Dolly, now, has got
a very good complexion:—indeed,
she's the very picture of health and
innocence.—You are, indeed, my
pretty lass;—but <HI>parva componere
magnis.</HI>—Miss Darnel is all amaz∣ing
beauty, delicacy, and dignity!
Then the softness and expression of
her fine blue eyes; her pouting lips
of coral hue; her neck, that rises
like a tower of polished alabaster be∣tween
two mounts of snow.—I tell
you what, gemmen, it don't signify
talking: if e'er a one of you was to
meet this young lady alone, in the
midst of a heath or common, or any
unfrequented place, he would down
on his knees, and think he kneeled
before some supernatural being. I'll
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
tell you more: she not only resem∣bles
an angel in beauty, but a saint in
goodness, and an hermit in humi∣lity;—so
void of all pride and af∣fectation;
so soft, and sweet, and af∣fable,
and humane! Lord! I could
tell such instances of her charity!—Sure
enough, she and Sir Launcelot
were formed by nature for each other:
howsoever, the cruel hand of fortune
hath intervened, and severed them for
ever. Every soul that knew them
both, said it was a thousand pities but
they should come together, and ex∣tinguish
in their happy union the mu∣tual
animosity of the two families,
which had so often embroiled the
whole neighbourhood. Nothing was
heard but the praises of miss Aurelia
Darnel and Mr. Launcelot Greaves;
and no doubt the parties were prepos∣sessed,
by this applause, in favour of
each other. At length, Mr. Greaves
went one Sunday to her parish-church;
but, though the greater part of the
congregation watched their looks,
they could not perceive that she took
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
least notice of him; or that he seemed
to be struck with her appearance.
He afterwards had an opportunity of
seeing her, more at leisure, at the
York-assembly, during the races; but
this opportunity was productive of
no good effect, because he had that
same day quarrelled with her uncle
on the turf.—An old grudge, you
know, gemmen, is soon inflamed to
a fresh rupture. It was thought Mr.
Darnel came on purpose to shew his
resentment. They differed about a
bet upon Miss Cleverlegs, and, in the
course of the dispute, Mr. Darnel cal∣led
him a petulant boy. The young
squire, who was as hasty as gunpow∣der,
told him he was man enough
to chastise him for his insolence;
and would do it on the spot, if he
thought it would not interrupt the di∣version.
In all probability they would
have come to points immediately, had
not the gentlemen interposed; so that
nothing further passed, but abun∣dance
of foul language on the part of
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
Mr. Anthony, and a repeated defiance
to single combat.</P>
<P>Mr. Greaves, making a low bow,
retired from the field; and in the
evening danced at the assembly with
a young lady from the Bishoprick,
seemingly in good temper and spi∣rits,
without having any words with
Mr. Darnel, who was also present.
But in the morning he visited that
proud neighbour betimes; and they
had almost reached a grove of trees
on the north-side of the town, when
they were suddenly overtaken by
half a dozen gentlemen, who had
watched their motions. It was in
vain for them to dissemble their de∣sign,
which could not now take ef∣fect.
They gave up their pistols,
and a reconciliation was patched up
by the pressing remonstrances of their
common friends; but Mr. Darnel's
hatred still rankled at bottom, and
soon broke out in the sequel. About
three months after this transaction, his
niece Aurelia, with her mother, hav∣ing
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
been to visit a lady in the chariot,
the horses being young, and not used
to the traces, were startled at the bray∣ing
of a jack-ass on the common, and
taking fright, ran away with the car∣riage
like lightning. The coachman
was thrown from the box, and the la∣dies
screamed piteously for help. Mr.
Greaves chanced to be a horse-back
on the other side of an inclosure,
when he heard their shrieks; and
riding up to the hedge, knew the
chariot, and saw their disafter. The
horses were then running full speed
in such a direction, as to drive head∣long
over a precipice into a stone-quarry,
where they and the chariot,
and the ladies, must be dashed in
pieces. You may conceive, gem∣men,
what his thoughts were when
he saw such a fine young lady, in
the flower of her age, just plunging
into eternity; when he saw the love∣ly
Aurelia on the brink of being pre∣cipitated
among rocks, where her de∣licate
limbs must be mangled and
tore asunder; when he perceived that,
<PB N="73" REF="78"/>
before he could ride round by the gate,
the tragedy would be finished. The
fence was so thick and high, flanked
with a broad ditch on the outside, that
he could not hope to clear it, although
he was mounted on <HI>Scipio,</HI> bred out
of Miss <HI>Cowslip,</HI> the sire <HI>Muley,</HI> and
his <HI>grandsire</HI> the famous Arabian <HI>Mu∣stapha.—Scipio</HI>
was bred by my father,
who would not have taken a hundred
guineas for him from any other person
but the young squire.—Indeed, I
have heard my poor father say”—</P>
<P>By this time Ferret's impatience was
become so outrageous, that he exclaim∣ed
in a furious tone, “Damn your fa∣ther,
and his horse, and his colt into
the bargain!”</P>
<P>Tom made no reply; but began
to strip with great expedition. Cap∣tain
Crowe was so choaked with pas∣sion,
that he could utter nothing but
disjointed sentences: he rose from his
seat, brandished his horsewhip, and
seizing his nephew by the collar, cried,
“Odd's heartlikins! sirrah, I have a
good mind—Devil fire your running
<PB N="74" REF="79"/>
tackle, you land-lubber!—can't you
steer without all this tacking hither
and thither, and the Lord knows whi∣ther?—'Noint
my block! I'd give
thee a rope's end for thy supper, if it
wan't”—</P>
<P>Dolly had conceived a sneaking
kindness for the young lawyer, and
thinking him in danger of being
roughly handled, flew to his relief.
She twisted her hand in Crowe's
neckcloth without ceremony, crying,
“Sha't then, I tell thee, old coger.—Who
kears a vig vor thy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oolish
trantrums?”</P>
<P>While Crowe looked black in the
face, and ran the risque of strangu∣lation
under the gripe of this amazon,
Mr. Clarke having disengaged him∣self
of his hat, wig, coat, and waist∣coat,
advanced in an elegant attitude
of manual offence towards the misan∣thrope,
who snatched up a gridiron
from the chimney-corner, and Dis∣cord
seemed to clap her sooty wings
in expectation of battle.—But as the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eader may have more than once al∣ready
<PB N="75" REF="80"/>
cursed the unconscionable length
of this chapter, we must postpone to
the next opportunity the incidents
that succeeded this denunciation of
war.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which it appears that the Knight,
when heartily set in for sleeping, was
not easily disturbed.</HEAD>
<P>IN all probability the kitchen of
the Black Lion, from a domestic
temple of society, and good-fellow∣ship,
would have been converted into
a scene or stage of sanguinary dispute,
had not Pallas or Discretion interposed
in the person of Mr. Fillet, and with
the assistance of the hostler disarmed
the combatants not only of their
arms, but also of their resentment.
The impetuosity of Mr. Clarke was
a little checked at sight of the grid∣iron,
which Ferret brandished with
uncommon dexterity; a circumstance
from whence the company were,
upon reflexion, induced to believe,
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
that before he plunged into the sea
of politicks, he had occasionally fi∣gured
in the character of that facetious
droll, who accompanies your itinerant
physicians, under the familiar appel∣lation
of Merry-Andrew, or Jack-Pudding,
and on a wooden stage en∣tertains
the populace with a solo on
the salt-box, or a sonnata on the tongs
and gridiron. Be that as it may, the
young lawyer seemed to be a little dis∣composed
at the glancing of this ex∣traordinary
weapon of offence, which
the fair hands of Dolly had scoured,
until it shone as bright as the shield of
Achilles; or as the emblem of good
old English fare, which hangs by a
red ribbon round the neck of that
thrice-honoured sage's head, in vel∣vet
bonnet cased, who presides by
rotation at the genial board, distin∣guished
by the title of the <HI>Beef-stake
Club:</HI> where the delicate rumps ir∣resistibly
attract the stranger's eye,
and, while they seem to cry “Come
cut me—come cut me,” constrain,
by wondrous sympathy, each mouth
<PB N="77" REF="82"/>
to overflow: where the obliging and
humorous Jemmy B—t, the gen∣tle
Billy H—d, replete with hu∣man
kindness, and the generous
Johnny B—d, respected and be∣loved
by all the world, attend as the
priests and ministers of Mirth, good
Cheer, and Jollity, and assist with
culinary art the raw, unpractised,
aukward guest.</P>
<P>But, to return from this digressive
simile: the hostler no sooner stept
between those menacing antagonists
than Tom Clarke very quietly re∣sumed
his cloaths, and Mr. Ferret
resigned the gridiron without further
question. The doctor did not find it
quite so easy to release the throat of
Capt. Crowe from the masculine grasp
of the virago Dolly, whose fingers
could not be disengaged until the ho∣nest
seaman was almost at the last gasp.
After some pause, during which he
panted for breath, and untied his neck∣cloth,
“Damn thee, for a brimstone
galley (cried he); I was never so grap∣pled
withal since I knew a card from
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>
a compass.—Adzooks! the jade
has so taughtened my rigging, d'ye
see, that I—Snatch my bowlings,
if I come athwart thy hawser, I'll
turn thy keel upwards—or mayhap
set thee a-driving under thy bare
poles—I will—I will, you hell-fire,
saucy—I will.”</P>
<P>Do'ly made no reply; but seeing
Mr. Clarke sit down again with great
composure, took her station likewise
at the opposite side of the apartment.
Then Mr. Fillet requested the lawyer
to proceed with his story, which, af∣ter
three hems, he accordingly pro∣secuted
in these words.</P>
<P>“I told you, gemmen, that Mr.
Greaves was mounted on Scipio,
when he saw miss Darnel and her
mother in danger of being hurried
over a precipice. Without reflect∣ing
a moment he gave Scipio the
spur, and at one spring he cleared
five and twenty feet, over hedge and
ditch, and every obstruction. Then
he rode full speed, in order to turn
the coach-horses; and, finding them
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>
quite wild and furious, endeavoured
to drive against the counter of the
hither horse, which he missed, and
staked poor Scipio on the pole of
the coach. The shock was so great,
that the coach-horses made a full
stop within ten yards of the quarry,
and Mr. Greaves was thrown for∣wards
towards the coach-box, which
mounting with admirable dexterity,
he seized the reins before the horses
could recover of their fright. At
that instant the coachman came run∣ning
up, and loosed them from the
traces with the utmost dispatch. Mr.
Greaves had now time to give his
attention to the ladies, who were
well nigh distracted with fear. He
no sooner opened the chariot-door
than Aurelia, with a wildness of look,
sprung into his arms; and, clasping
him round the neck, fainted away.
I leave you to guess, gemmen, what
were his feelings at this instant. The
mother was not so discomposed, but
that she could contribute to the reco∣very
of her daughter, whom the young
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>
squire still supported in his embrace.
At length she retrieved the use of her
senses, and perceiving the situation in
which she was, the blood revisited her
face with a redoubled glow, while she
desired him to set her down upon the
turf.</P>
<P>“Mrs. Darnel, far from being
shy or reserved in her compliments
of acknowledgments, kissed Mr.
Launcelot without ceremony, the
tears of gratitude running down her
cheeks: she called him her dear son,
her generous deliverer, who, at the
hazard of his own life, had saved her
and her child from the most dismal
fate that could be imagined. Mr.
Greaves was so much transported on
this occasion, that he could not help
disclosing a passion, which he had hi∣therto
industriously concealed. “What
I have done (said he) was but a com∣mon
office of humanity, which I
would have performed for any of my
fellow-creatures: but, for the preser∣vation
of miss Aurelia Darnel, I would
at any time sacrifice my life with plea∣sure.”
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>
The young lady did not hear
this declaration unmoved: her face was
again flushed, and her eyes sparkled
with pleasure: nor was the youth's
confession disagreeable to the good
lady her mother, who at one glance
perceived all the advantages of such
an union between the two families.</P>
<P>“Mr. Greaves proposed to send the
coachman to his father's stable for
a pair of sober horses, that could be
depended upon, to draw the ladies
home to their own habitation; but
they declined the offer, and chose to
walk, as the distance was not great.
He then insisted upon his being their
conductor; and, each taking him
under the arm, supported them to
their own gate, where such an ap∣parition
filled all the domestics with
astonishment. Mrs. Darnel, taking
him by the hand, led him into the
house, where she welcomed him with
another affectionate embrace, and in∣dulged
him with an ambrosial kiss
of Aurelia, saying, “But for you,
we had both been by this time in
<PB N="82" REF="87"/>
eternity.—Sure it was heaven that
sent you as an angel to our assistance!”
She kindly inquired if he had him∣self
sustained any damage in admini∣string
that desperate remedy to which
they owed their lives. She enter∣tained
him with a small collation;
and, in the course of the conversa∣tion,
lamented the animosity which
had so long divided two neighbouring
families of such influence and cha∣racter.
He was not slow in signifying
his approbation of her remarks, and
expressing the most eager desire of
seeing all those unhappy differences re∣moved:
in a word, they parted with
mutual satisfaction.</P>
<P>“Just as he advanced from the out∣ward
gate, on his return to Greaves∣bury-hall,
he was met by Anthony
Darnel on horseback, who riding up
to him with marks of surprize and re∣sentment,
saluted him with “Your
servant, Sir.—Have you any com∣mands
for me?” The other reply∣ing
with an air of indifference, “None
at all,” Mr. Darnel asked, what had
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>
procured him the honour of a visit. The
young gentleman, perceiving by the
manner in which he spoke that the
old quarrel was not yet extinguished,
answered, with equal disdain, that
the visit was not intended for him;
and that, if he wanted to know the
cause of it, he might inform himself
by his own servants. “So I shall
(cried the uncle of Aurelia); and per∣haps
let you know my sentiments of
the matter—” “Hereafter as it may
be,” said the youth; who, turning
out of the avenue, walked home, and
made his father acquainted with the
particulars of this adventure.</P>
<P>“The old gentleman chid him for
his rashness; but seemed pleased with
the success of his attempt, and still
more so, when he understood his sen∣timents
of Aurelia, and the deport∣ment
of the ladies.</P>
<P>“Next day the son sent over a ser∣vant
with a compliment, to enquire
about their health; and the messen∣ger,
being seen by Mr. Darnel, was
told that the ladies were indisposed,
<PB N="84" REF="89"/>
and did not chuse to be troubled
with messages. The mother was
really seized with a fever, produced
by the agitation of her spirits, which
every day became more and more
violent, until the physicians despaired
of her life. Believing that her end
approached, she sent a trusty servant
to Mr. Greaves, desiring that she
might see him without delay; and
he immediately set out with the mes∣senger,
who introduced him in the
dark. He found the old lady in
bed, almost exhausted, and the fair
Aurelia sitting by her, overwhelmed
with grief, her lovely hair in the ut∣most
disorder, and her charming eyes
inflamed with weeping. The good
lady beckoning Mr. Launcelot to ap∣proach,
and directing all the atten∣dants
to quit the room, except a fa∣vourite
maid, from whom I learned
the story, she took him by the hand,
and fixing her eyes upon him with all
the fondness of a mother, shed some
tears, in silence, while the same marks
of sorrow trickled down his cheeks.
<PB N="85" REF="90"/>
After this affecting pause, “My dear
son (said she), Oh! that I could have
lived to see you so indeed! you find me
hastening to the goal of life”—Here
the tender-hearted Aurelia, being un∣able
to contain herself longer, broke
out into a violent passion of grief, and
wept aloud. The mother, waiting
patiently till she had thus given vent
to her anguish, calmly intreated her
to resign herself submissively to the
will of heaven: then turning to Mr.
Launcelot, “I had indulged (said she)
a fond hope of seeing you allied to my
family.—This is no time for me to
insist upon the ceremonies and forms
of a vain world.—Aurelia looks up∣on
you with the eyes of tender pre-possession.”
No sooner had she pro∣nounced
these words than he threw
himself on his knees before the young
lady, and, pressing her hand to his
lips, breathed the softest expressions
which the most delicate love could
suggest. “I know (resumed the
mother) that your passion is mutual∣ly
sincere; and I should die satisfied,
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>
if I thought your union would not be
opposed: but that violent man, my
brother-in-law, who is Aurelia's sole
guardian, will thwart her wishes with
every obstacle that brutal resentment
and implacable malice can contrive.
Mr. Greaves, I have long admired
your virtues, and am confident that I
can depend upon your honour.—
You shall give me your word, that,
when I am gone, you will take no
steps in this affair without the con∣currence
of your father; and endea∣vour,
by all fair and honourable
means, to vanquish the prejudices,
and obtain the consent of her uncle:
the rest we must leave to the dispen∣sation
of Providence.”</P>
<P>“The squire promised, in the most
solemn and fervent manner, to obey
all her injunctions, as the last dictates
of a parent whom he should never
cease to honour. Then she favoured
them both with a great deal of saluta∣ry
advice, touching their conduct be∣fore
and after marriage; and presented
him with a ring, as a memorial of her
<PB N="87" REF="92"/>
affection: at the same time he pulled
another off his finger, and made a ten∣der
of it as a pledge of his love to Au∣relia,
whom her mother permitted to
receive this token. Finally, he took
a last farewel of the good matron, and
returned to his father with the parti∣culars
of this interview.</P>
<P>“In two days Mrs. Darnel departed
this life, and Aurelia was removed to
the house of a relation, where her
grief had like to have proved fatal to
her constitution.</P>
<P>“In the mean time, the mother
was no sooner committed to the earth
than Mr. Greaves, mindful of her ex∣hortations,
began to take measures for
a reconciliation with the guardian. He
engaged several gentlemen to inter∣pose
their good offices; but they al∣ways
met with the most mortifying
repulse: and at last Anthony Darnel
declared, that his hatred to the house
of Greaves was hereditary, habitual,
and unconquerable. He swore he
would spend his heart's blood to per∣petuate
the quarrel; and that, sooner
<PB N="88" REF="93"/>
than his niece should match with
young Launcelot, he would sacrifice
her with his own hand. The young
gentleman, finding his prejudice so
rancorous and invincible, left off
making any further advances; and,
since he found it impossible to obtain
his consent, resolved to cultivate the
good graces of Aurelia, and wed her
in despite of her implacable guardian.
He found means to establish a literary
correspondence with her, as soon as
her grief was a little abated; and even
to effect an interview, after her return
to her own house: but he soon had
reason to repent of this indulgence.
The uncle entertained spies upon the
young lady, who gave him an account
of this meeting; in consequence of
which she was suddenly hurried to
some distant part of the country, which
we never could discover.</P>
<P>“It was then we thought Mr.
Launcelot a little disordered in his
brain, his grief was so wild, and his
passion so impetuous. He refused all
sustenance, neglected his person, re∣nounced
<PB N="89" REF="94"/>
his amusements, rode out in
the rain, sometimes bare headed,
strolled about the fields all night, and
became so peevish, that none of the
domesticks durst speak to him, with∣out
the hazard of broken bones.
Having played these pranks for about
three weeks, to the unspeakable cha∣grin
of his father, and the astonish∣ment
of all that knew him, he sud∣denly
grew calm, and his good hu∣mour
returned. But this, as your
sea-faring people say, was a deceitful
calm, that soon ushered in a dread∣ful
storm.</P>
<P>“He had long sought an opportu∣nity
to tamper with some of Mr. Dar∣nel's
servants, who could inform him
of the place where Aurelia was con∣fined;
but there was not one about the
family who could give him that satis∣faction:
for the persons who accom∣panied
her, remained as a watch up∣on
her motions, and none of the other
domestics were privy to the transaction.
All attempts proving fruitless, he could
no longer restain his impatience; but
<PB N="90" REF="95"/>
throwing himself in the way of the
uncle, upbraided him in such harsh
terms, that a formal challenge ensued.
They agreed to decide their diffe∣rence
without witnesses; and one
morning, before sun-rise, met on that
very common where Mr. Greaves had
saved the life of Aurelia. The first
pistol was fired on each side without
any effect; but Mr. Darnel's second
wounded the young squire in the
flank: nevertheless, having a pistol in
reserve, he desired his antagonist to
ask his life. The other, instead of
submitting, drew his sword; and Mr.
Greaves, firing his piece into the air,
followed his example. The contest
then became very hot, tho' of short
continuance. Darnel being disarmed
at the first onset, our young squire gave
him back the sword, which he was
base enough to use a second time
against his conqueror. Such an in∣stance
of repeated ingratitude and bru∣tal
ferocity divested Mr. Greaves of
his temper and forbearance. He at∣tacked
Mr. Anthony with great fury,
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>
and at the first longe ran him up to
the hilt, at the same time seizing with
his left hand the shell of his enemy's
sword, which he broke in disdain.
Mr. Darnel having fallen, the other
immediately mounted his horse, which
he had tied to a tree before the en∣gagement;
and riding full speed to
Ashenton, sent a surgeon to Antho∣ny's
assistance. He afterwards inge∣nuously
confessed all these particulars
to his father, who was overwhelmed
with consternation, for the wounds of
Darnel were judged mortal; and as
no person had seen the particulars of
the duel, Mr. Launcelot might have
been convicted of murder.</P>
<P>“On these considerations, before a
warrant could be served upon him,
the old knight, by dint of the most
eager intreaties, accompanied with
marks of horror and despair, prevailed
upon his son to withdraw himself from
the kingdom, until such time as the
storm should be overblown. Had his
heart been unengaged, he would have
chose to travel; but at this period,
<PB N="92" REF="97"/>
when his whole soul was engrossed
and so violently agitated by his passion
for Aurelia, nothing but the fear of
seeing the old gentleman run distrac∣ted,
would have induced him to desist
from the pursuit of that young lady
far less quit the kingdom where she,
resided. Well then, gemmen, he
repaired to Harwich, where he em∣barked
for Holland, from whence he
proceeded to Brussels, where he pro∣cured
a pass-port from the French
king, by virtue of which he travelled
to Marseilles, and there took a tartan
for Genoa. The first letter sir Ever∣hard
received from him was dated at
Florence. Mean while the surgeon's
prognostic was not altogether verified.
Mr. Darnel did not die immediately
of his wounds; but he lingered a long
time, as it were in the arms of death,
and even partly recovered: yet, in all
probability, he will never be wholly re∣stored
to the enjoyment of his health;
and is obliged every summer to attend
the hot well at Bristol. As his wounds
began to heal, his hatred to Mr.
<PB N="93" REF="98"/>
Greaves seemed to revive with aug∣mented
violence; and he is now, if
possible, more than ever determined
against all reconciliation. Mr. Laun∣celot,
after having endeavoured to
amuse his imagination with a succes∣sion
of curious objects, in a tour of
Italy, took up his residence at a town
called Pisa, and there fell into a deep
melancholy, from which nothing could
rouse him but the news of his fa∣ther's
death.</P>
<P>“The old gentleman (God rest his
soul) never held up his head after the
departure of his darling Launcelot;
and the dangerous condition of Dar∣nel
kept up his apprehension: this
was reinforced by the obstinate silence
of the youth, and certain accounts of
his disordered mind, which he had re∣ceived
from some of those persons who
take pleasure in communicating disa∣greeable
tidings. A complication of
all these grievances, co-operating with
a severe <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it of the gout and gravel,
produced a fever, which in a few days
brought sir Everhard to his long home;
<PB N="94" REF="99"/>
after he had settled his affairs with
heaven and earth, and made his peace
with God and man. I'll assure you,
gemmen, he made a most edifying
and christian end: he died regretted
by all his neighbours except Anthony,
and might be said to be embalmed by
the tears of the poor, to whom he was
always a bounteous benefactor.</P>
<P>“When the son, now sir Launce∣lot,
came home, he appeared so mea∣gre,
wan, and hollow-eyed, that the
servants hardly knew their young mas∣ter.
His first care was to take posses∣sion
of his fortune, and settle accounts
with the steward who had succeeded
my father. These affairs being dis∣cussed,
he spared no pains to get in∣telligence
concerning miss Darnel;
and soon learned more of that young
lady than he desired to know; for it
was become the common talk of the
country, that a match was agreed up∣on
between her and young squire Sy∣camore,
a gentleman of a very great
fortune. These tidings were pro∣bably
confirmed under her own hand,
<PB N="95" REF="100"/>
in a letter which she wrote to sir
Launcelot. The contents were never
exactly known but to the parties them∣selves:
nevertheless, the effects were
too visible; for, from that blessed mo∣ment,
he spoke not one word to any
living creature for the space of three
days: but was seen sometimes to shed
a flood of tears, and sometimes to burst
out into a fit of laughing. At last he
broke silence, and seemed to wake
from his disorder. He became more
fond than ever of the exercise of
riding, and began to amuse himself
again with acts of benevolence. One
instance of his generosity and justice
deserves to be recorded in brass or
marble: you must know, gemmen,
the rector of the parish was lately
dead, and sir Everhard had promised
the presentation to another clergyman.
In the mean time, sir Launcelot
chancing one Sunday to ride through
a lane, perceived a horse saddled and
bridled feeding on the side of a fence;
and casting his eyes around, beheld
on the other side of the hedge an ob∣ject
<PB N="96" REF="101"/>
lying extended on the ground,
which he took to be the body of a
murdered traveller. He forthwith
alighted; and, leaping into the field,
descried a man at full length wrapped
in a great coat, and writhing in ago∣ny.
Approaching nearer, he found
it was a clergyman, in his gown and
cassock. When he inquired into the
case, and offered his assistance, the
stranger rose up, thanked him for his
courtesy, and declared that he was
now very well. The knight, who
thought there was something myste∣rious
in this incident, expressed a de∣sire
to know the cause of his rolling in
the grass in that manner; and the
clergyman, who knew his person,
made no scruple in gratifying his cu∣riosity.
“You must know, sir, said
he, I serve the curacy of your own
parish, for which the late incumbent
payed me twenty pounds a year; but
this sum being scarce sufficient to
maintain my wife and children, who
are five in number, I agreed to read
prayers in the afternoon at another
<PB N="97" REF="102"/>
church about four miles from hence;
and for this additional duty I receive
ten pounds more: as I keep a horse,
it was formerly an agreeable exercise
rather than a toil; but of late years I
have been afflicted with a rupture, for
which I consulted the most eminent
operators in the kingdom; but I have
no cause to rejoice in the effects of
their advice, though one of them as∣sured
me I was completely cured.
The malady is now more troublesome
than ever, and often comes upon me
so violently while I am on horseback,
that I am forced to alight, and lie
down upon the ground, until the cause
of the disorder can for the time be re∣duced.”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot not only condoled
with him upon his misfortune, but de∣sired
him to throw up the second cure,
and he would pay him ten pounds a
year out of his own pocket. Your
generosity confounds me, good sir:
(cried the clergyman) and yet I ought
not to be surprised at any instance of
benevolence in sir Launcelot Greaves;
<PB N="98" REF="103"/>
but I will check the fulness of my
heart. I shall only observe, that your
good intention towards me can hard∣ly
take effect. The gentleman, who
is to succeed the late incumbent, has
given me notice to quit the premises,
as he hath provided a friend of his
own for the curacy.” “What! (cried
the knight) does he mean to take your
bread from you, without assigning any
other reason?” “Surely, sir, replied
the ecclesiastic, I know of no other
reason. I hope my morals are irre∣proachable,
and that I have done my
duty with a conscientious regard: I
may venture an appeal to the parishi∣oners
among whom I have lived these
seventeen years. After all, it is na∣tural
for every man to favour his own
friends in preference to strangers. As
for me, I propose to try my fortune
in the great city; and I doubt not but
providence will provide for me and
my little ones.” To this declaration
Sir Launcelot made no reply; but ri∣ding
home set on foot a strict enquiry
into the character of this man, whose
<PB N="99" REF="104"/>
name was Jenkins. He found that
he was a reputed scholar, equally re∣markable
for his modesty and good
life; that he visited the sick, assisted
the needy, compromised disputes a∣mong
his neighbours, and spent his
time in such a manner as would have
done honour to any christian divine.
Thus informed, the knight sent for
the gentleman to whom the living
had been promised, and accosted him
to this effect: “Mr. Tootle, I have
a favour to ask of you. The person
who serves the cure of this parish, is
a man of good character, beloved by
the people, and has a large family. I
shall be obliged to you if you will
continue him in the curacy.” The
other told him he was sorry he could
not comply with his request, being
that he had already promised the cu∣racy
to a friend of his own.” “No
matter: (replied Sir Launcelot) since
I have not interest with you, I will
endeavour to provide for Mr. Jenkins
in some other way.”</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105"/>
That same afternoon he walked
over to the curate's house, and told
him that he had spoken in his behalf
to Dr. Tootle, but the curacy was pre∣engaged.
The good man having
made a thousand acknowledgments
for the trouble his honour had taken;
“I have not interest sufficient to make
you curate, (said the knight) but I
can give you the living itself, and that
you shall have.” So saying, he re∣tired;
leaving Mr. Jenkins incapable
of uttering one syllable, so powerful∣ly
was he struck with this unexpected
turn of fortune. The presentation
was immediately made out; and in a
few days Mr. Jenkins was put in pos∣session
of his benefice, to the inex∣pressible
joy of the congregation. Hi∣therto
every thing went right, and
every unprejudiced person commended
the knight's conduct: but, in a little
time, his generosity seemed to over∣leap
the bounds of discretion; and
even in some cases might be thought
tending to a breach of the king's
peace. For example, he compelled,
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
<HI>vi &amp; armis,</HI> a rich farmer's son to
marry the daughter of a cottager,
whom the young fellow had de∣bauched.
Indeed it seems there was
a promise of marriage in the case,
though it could not be legally ascer∣tained.
The wench took on dismal∣ly;
and her parents had recourse to
Sir Launcelot, who, sending for the
delinquent, expostulated with him se∣verely
on the injury he had done the
young woman, and exhorted him to
save her life and reputation by per∣forming
his promise; in which case
he (Sir Launcelot) would give her
three hundred pounds to her portion.
Whether the farmer thought there
was something interested in this un∣common
offer, or was a little elevated
by the consciousness of his father's
wealth; he rejected the proposal with
rustic disdain, and said, if so be as
how the wench would swear the child
to him, he would settle it with the
parish: but declared, that no squire
in the land should oblige him to
buckle with such a cracked pitcher.
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>
This resolution, however, he could
not maintain: for, in less than two
hours, the rector of the parish had
direction to publish the banns, and
the ceremony was performed in due
course.</P>
<P>Now, though we know not precise∣ly
the nature of the arguments that
were used with the farmer, we may
conclude they were of the minatory
species; for the young fellow could
not, for some time, look any person in
the face. The knight acted as the
general redresser of grievances. If a
woman complained to him of being
ill treated by her husband, he first in∣quired
into the foundation of the
complain; and if he found it just,
catechised the defendant. If the
warning had no effect, and the man
proceeded to fresh acts of violence;
then his judge took the execution of
the law in his own hand, and horse∣whipped
the party. Thus he invol∣ved
himself in several law-suits, that
drained him of pretty large sums of
money. He seemed particularly in∣censed
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>
at the least appearance of op∣pression;
and supported divers poor
tenants against the extortion of the
landlords. Nay, he has been known
to travel two hundred miles as a vo∣lunteer;
to offer his assistance in the
cause of a person, who he heard was
by chicanery and oppression wronged
of a considerable estate. He accord∣ingly
took her under his protection,
relieved her distresses, and was at a
vast expence in bringing the suit to a
determination; which being unsa∣vourable
to his client, he resolved to
bring an appeal into the house of
lords, and certainly would have exe∣cuted
his purpose, if the gentlewoman
had not died in the interim.”</P>
<P>At this period Ferret interrupted
the narrator, by observing that the
said Greaves was a common nusance,
and ought to be prosecuted on the sta∣tute
of barretry. “No, sir, (resumed
Mr. Clarke) he cannot be convicted
of barretry, unless he is always at va∣riance
with some person or other, a
mover of suits and quarrels, who dis∣turbs
<PB N="104" REF="109"/>
the peace under colour of law.
Therefore he is in the indictment
stiled, <HI>Communis malefactor, calumnia∣tor
&amp; seminator litium.</HI> “Prithee,
truce with thy definitions, (cried Fer∣ret)
and make an end of thy long∣winded
story. Thou hast no title to
be so tedious, until thou comest to
have a coif in the court of common
pleas.” Tom smiled contemptuous,
and had just opened his mouth to
proceed, when the company were
disturbed by a hideous repetition of
groans, that seemed to issue from the
chamber in which the body of the
squire was deposited. The landlady
snatched the candle, and ran into the
room, followed by the doctor and the
rest; and this accident naaturally sus∣pended
the narration. In like man∣ner
we shall conclude the chapter, that
the reader may have time to breathe,
and digest what he has already heard.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="105" REF="110"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which this recapitulation draws to a close.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the landlady entered the
room from whence the groan∣ing
proceeded, she found the squire
lying on his back under the dominion
of the night-mare, which rode him
so hard, that he not only groaned and
snorted, but the sweat ran down his
face in streams. The perturbation of
his brain, occasioned by this pressure,
and the fright he had lately under∣gone,
gave rise to a very terrible
dream, in which he fancied himself
apprehended for a robbery. The hor∣ror
of the gallows was strong upon
him, when he was suddenly awaked
by a violent shock from the doctor;
and the company broke in upon his
view, still perverted by fear, and be∣dimmed
by slumber. His dream was
now realized by a full persuasion that
he was surrounded by the constable
and his gang. The first object that
<PB N="106" REF="111"/>
presented itself to his disordered view
was the figure of Ferret, who might
very well have passed for the finisher
of the law: against him therefore the
first effort of his despair was directed.
He started upon the floor; and seizing
a certain utensil, that shall be name∣less,
launched it at the misanthrope
with such violence, that, had he not
cautiously slipped his head aside, it is
supposed that actual fire would have
been produced from the collision of
two such hard and solid substances.
All future mischief was prevented by
the strength and agility of captain
Crowe, who, springing upon the as∣sailant,
pinioned his arms to his sides,
crying, “O damn ye, if you are for
running a-head, I'll soon bring you
to your bearings.” The squire thus
restrained, soon recollected himself,
and gazing upon every individual in
the apartment, “Wounds! (said he)
I've had an ugly dream. I thought,
for all the world, they were carrying
me to Newgate; and that there was
Jack Ketch coom to vetch me before
<PB N="107" REF="112"/>
my taim.” Ferret, who was the person
he had thus distinguished, eying him
with a look of the most emphatic ma∣levolence,
told him, it was very na∣tural
for a knave to dream of New∣gate;
and that he hoped to see the
day when this dream would be found
a true prophecy, and the common∣wealth
purged of all such rogues and
vagabonds: but it could not be ex∣pected
that the vulgar would be ho∣nest
and conscientious, while the great
were distinguished by profligacy and
corruption. The squire was disposed
to make a practical reply to this insi∣nuation,
when Mr. Ferret prudently
withdrew himself from the scene of
altercation. The good woman of the
house persuaded his antagonist to take
out his nap, assuring him that the eggs
and bacon, with a mug of excellent
ale, should be forthcoming in due sea∣son.
The affair being thus fortunate∣ly
adjusted, the guests returned to the
kitchen, and Mr. Clarke resumed his
story to this effect. “You'll please to
take notice, gemmen, that besides the
<PB N="108" REF="113"/>
instances I have alledged of Sir Laun∣celot's
extravagant benevolence, I could
recount a great many others of the
same nature, and particularly the lau∣dable
vengeance he took of a country
lawyer.——I'm sorry that any such
miscreant should belong to the pro∣fession.
He was clerk of the assize,
gemmen, in a certain town, not a
great way distant, and having a blank
pardon left by the judges for some
criminals, whose cases were attended
with favourable circumstances, he
would not insert the name of one who
could not procure a guinea for the
fee; and the poor fellow, who had
only stole an hour-glass out of a shoe∣maker's
window, was actually exe∣cuted
after a long respite; during
which he had been permitted to go
abroad, and earn his subsistence by his
daily labour.</P>
<P>“Sir Launcelot, being informed of
this barbarous act of avarice, and
having some ground that bordered on
the lawyer's estate, not only rendered
him contemptible and infamous, by
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>
exposing him as often as they met on
the grand jury, but also, being vested
with the property of the great tythes,
proved such a troublesome neighbour,
sometimes by making waste among
his hay and corn, sometimes by insti∣tuting
suits against him for petty tres∣passes,
that he was fairly obliged to
quit his habitation, and remove into
another part of the kingdom. All
these avocations could not divert Sir
Launcelot from the execution of a
wild scheme, which has carried his
extravagance to such a pitch, that I
am afraid if a statute——you under∣stand
me, gemmen, were sued, the
jury would——I don't choose to ex∣plain
myself further on this circum∣stance.
Be that as it may, the ser∣vants
at Greavesbury-hall were not a
little confounded, when their master
took down from the family armoury
a compleat suit of armour, which had
belonged to his great grandfather, Sir
Marmaduke Greaves, a great war∣rior,
who lost his life in the service of
his king. This armour being scoured,
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>
repaired, and altered, so as to fit Sir
Launcelot, a certain knight, whom I
don't choose to name, because I be∣lieve
he cannot be proved <HI>compos men∣tis,</HI>
came down seemingly on a visit,
with two attendants; and, on the eve
of the festival of St. George, the ar∣mour
being carried into the chapel,
Sir Launcelot (Lord have mercy upon
us!) remained all night in that dismal
place, alone and without light, though
it was confidently reported all over the
country, that the place was haunted
by the spirit of his great great uncle,
who, being lunatic, had cut his throat
from ear to ear, and was found dead
on the communion table.”</P>
<P>It was observed, that while Mr.
Clarke rehearsed this circumstance,
his eyes began to stare, and his teeth
to chatter; while Dolly, whose looks
were fixed invariably on this narrator,
growing pale, and hitching her joint∣stool
nearer the chimney, exclaimed
in a frightened tone, “Moother,
moother, in the neame of God, look
to 'un! how a quakes! as I'm a
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
precious saoul, a looks as if a saw
something.” Tom forced a smile, and
thus proceeded:</P>
<P>“While Sir Launcelot tarried with∣in
the chapel, with the doors all
locked, the other knight stalked round
and round it on the outside, with his
sword drawn, to the terror of divers
persons who were present at the cere∣mony.
As soon as day broke he
opened one of the doors, and, going
in to Sir Launcelot, read a book for
some time, which we did suppose to
be the constitutions of knight-erran∣try:
then we heard a loud slap which
ecchoed through the whole chapel,
and the stranger pronounce with an
audible and solemn voice, “In the
name of God, St. Michael, and St.
George, I dub thee knight—be faith∣ful,
bold, and fortunate.” You can∣not
imagine, gemmen, what an effect
this strange ceremony had upon the
people who were assembled. They
gazed at one another in silent horror;
and, when Sir Launcelot came forth
completely armed, took to their heels
<PB N="112" REF="117"/>
in a body, and fled with the utmost
precipitation. I myself was over∣turned
in the crowd; and this was
the case with that very individual per∣son
who now serves him as a squire.
He was so frightened that he could
not rise, but lay roaring in such a
manner, that the knight came up, and
gave him a thwack with his launce
across the shoulders, which roused him
with a vengeance. For my own part,
I freely own I was not altogether un∣moved
at seeing such a figure come
stalking out of a church in the grey of
the morning; for it recalled to my re∣membrance
the idea of the ghost in
Hamlet, which I had seen acted in
Drury-lane, when I made my first
trip to London; and I had not yet got
rid of the impression.</P>
<P>“Sir Launcelot, attended by the
other knight, proceeded to the stable;
from whence, with his own hands,
he drew forth one of his best horses,
a fine mettlesome sorrel, who had got
blood in him, ornamented with rich
trappings. In a trice the two knights,
<PB N="113" REF="118"/>
and the other two strangers, who now
appeared to be trumpeters, were
mounted. Sir Launcelot's armour
was lacquered black; and on his
shield was represented the moon in
her first quarter, with the motto <HI>im∣pleat
orbem.</HI> The trumpets having
sounded a charge, the stranger pro∣nounced
with a loud voice, “God pre∣serve
this gallant knight in all his ho∣nourable
atchievements; and may he
long continue to press the sides of his
now adopted steed, which I denominate
Bronzomarte, hoping that he will ri∣val
in swiftness and spirit Bayardo,
Brigliadoro, or any other steed of past
or present chivalry? After another
flourish of the trumpets, all four clap∣ped
spurs to their horses, Sir Launce∣lot
couching his launce, and galloped
to and fro, as if they had been mad,
to the terror and astonishment of all
the spectators. What should have
induced our knight to choose this here
man for his squire, is not easy to de∣termine;
for, of all the servants about
the house, he was the least likely ei∣ther
<PB N="114" REF="119"/>
to please his master, or engage in
such an undertaking. His name is
Timothy Crabshaw, and he acted in
the capacity of whipper-in to Sir Ever∣hard.
He afterwards married the
daughter of a poor cottager, by whom
he has several children, and was em∣ployed
about the house as a plough∣man
and carter. To be sure the fel∣low
has a dry sort of humour about
him: but he was universally hated
among the servants for his abusive
tongue and perverse disposition, which
often brought him into trouble; for
though the fellow is as strong as an
elephant, he has no more courage na∣turally
than a chicken—I say natural∣ly,
because, since his being a member
of knight-errantry, he has done some
things that appear altogether incredi∣ble
and praeternatural.</P>
<P>“Timothy kept such a bawling,
after he had received the blow from
Sir Launcelot, that every body on the
field thought some of his bones were
broken; and his wife, with five bant∣lings,
came snivelling to the knight,
<PB N="115" REF="120"/>
who ordered her to send the hus∣band
directly to his house. Tim ac∣cordingly
went thither, groaning pi∣teously
all the way, creeping along
with his body bent like a Greenland
canoe. As soon as he entered the
court, the outward door was shut;
and Sir Launcelot coming down stairs
with a horsewhip in his hand, asked
what was the matter with him that he
complained so dismally? To this que∣stion
he replied, that it was as com∣mon
as duck-weed in his country, for
a man to complain when his bones
were broke.” “What should have
broke your bones?” said the knight.
“I cannot guess, (answered the other)
unless it was that delicate switch that
your honour in your mad pranks
handled so dextrously upon my car∣case.”
Sir Launcelot then told him,
there was nothing so good for a bruise
as a sweat, and he had the remedy in
his hand. Timothy eying the horse∣whip
askance, observed that there
was another still more speedy; to wit,
a moderate pill of lead, with a suffi∣cient
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>
dose of gun-powder. “No,
rascal, (cried the knight) that must
be reserved for your betters.” So say∣ing,
he employed the instrument so
effectually, that Crabshaw soon forgot
his fractured ribs, and capered about
with great agility. When he had
been disciplined in this manner to
some purpose, the knight told him he
might retire; but ordered him to re∣turn
next morning, when he should
have a repetition of the medicine, pro∣vided
he did not find himself capable
of walking in an erect posture. The
gate was no sooner thrown open, than
Timothy ran home with all the speed
of a grey-hound, and corrected his
wife, by whose advice he had pre∣tended
to be so grievously damaged in
his person. No body dreamed that
he would next day present himself at
Greavesbury-hall; nevertheless, he was
there very early in the morning, and
even closetted a whole hour with Sir
Launcelot. He came out making wry
faces, and several times slapped him∣self
on the fore-head, crying, “Bodi∣kins!
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>
thof he be creazy, I an't, that
I an't!” When he was asked what
was the matter, he said, he believed
the devil had got in him, and he
should never be his own man again.
That same day the knight carried him
to Ashenton, where he bespoke those
accoutrements which he now wears;
and while these were making, it was
thought the poor fellow would have
run distracted. He did nothing but
growl, and curse, and swear to him∣self,
run backwards and forwards be∣tween
his own hutt and Greavesbury∣hall,
and quarrel with the horses in
the stable. At length his wife and fa∣mily
were removed into a snug farm∣house
that happened to be empty, and
care taken that they should be com∣fortably
maintained.</P>
<P>“These precautions being taken,
the knight, one morning, at day∣break,
mounted Bronzomarte, and
Crabshaw as his squire, ascended the
back of a clumsy cart-horse, called
Gilbert. This again was looked up∣on
as an instance of insanity in the
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
said Crabshaw; for, of all the horses
in the stable, Gilbert was the most
stubborn and vicious, and had often
like to have done a mischief to Timo∣thy
while he drove the cart and
plough. When he was out of hu∣mour
he would kick and plunge as if
the devil was in him. He once thrust
Crabshaw into the middle of a quick∣set-hedge,
where he was terribly torn;
another time he canted him over his
head into a quagmire, where he stuck
with his heels up, and must have pe∣rished
if people had not been passing
that way; a third time he seized him
in the stable with his teeth by the rim
of the belly, and swung him off the
ground, to the great danger of his life;
and I'll be hanged if it was not owing
to Gilbert that Crabshaw was now
thrown into the river. Thus mounted
and accoutred, the knight and his
squire set out on their first excursion.
They turned off from the common
highway, and travelled all that day
without meeting any thing worth re∣counting:
but, in the morning of the
<PB N="119" REF="124"/>
second day, they were favoured with
an adventure. The hunt was upon
a common, through which they tra∣velled,
and the hounds were in full
cry after a fox, when Crabshaw,
prompted by his own mischievous dis∣position,
and neglecting the order of
his master, who called aloud to him
to desist, rode up to the hounds, and
crossed them at full gallop. The
huntsman, who was not far off, run∣ning
towards the squire, bestowed up∣on
his head such a memento with his
pole, as made the landschape dance
before his eyes; and in a twinkling
he was surrounded by all the fox∣hunters,
who plied their whips about
his ears with infinite agility. Sir
Launcelot advancing at an easy pace,
instead of assisting the disastrous squire,
exhorted his adversaries to punish him
severely for his insolence, and they
were not slow in obeying this injunc∣tion.
Crabshaw finding himself in
this disagreeable situation, and that
there was no succour to be expected
from his master, on whose prowess he
<PB N="120" REF="125"/>
had depended, grew desperate; and,
clubbing his whip, laid about him
with great fury, wheeling about Gil∣bert,
who was not idle; for he, hav∣ing
received some of the favours in∣tended
for his rider, both bit with
his teeth, and kicked with his heels;
and at last made his way through the
ring that incircled him, though not
before he had broke the huntsman's
leg, lamed one of the best horses on
the field, and killed half a score of
the hounds. Crabshaw seeing him∣self
clear of the fray, did not tarry to
take leave of his master, but made the
most of his way to Greavesbury-hall,
where he appeared hardly with any
vestige of the human countenance, so
much had he been defaced in this ad∣venture.
He did not fail to raise a
great clamour against Sir Launcelot,
whom he cursed as a coward in plain
terms, swearing he would never serve
him another day: but whether he al∣tered
his mind on cooler reflection, or
was lectured by his wife, who well
understood her own interest, he rose
<PB N="121" REF="126"/>
with the cock, and went again in
quest of Sir Launcelot, whom he
found on the eve of a very hazardous
enterprize. In the midst of a lane
the knight happened to meet with a
party of about forty recruits, com∣manded
by a serjeant, a corporal,
and a drummer, which last had his
drum slung at his back; but seeing
such a strange figure mounted on a
high-spirited horse, he was seiz∣ed
with an inclination to divert his
company. With this view he braced
his drum, and, hanging it in its pro∣per
position, began to beat a point of
war, advancing under the very nose of
Bronzomarte; while the corporal ex∣claimed,
“Damn my eyes, who have
we got here? old king Stephen, from
the horse armoury, in the Tower; or
the fellow that rides armed at my
lord mayor's shew.” The knight's
steed seemed at least as well pleased
with the sound of the drum as were
the recruits that followed it; and sig∣nified
his satisfaction in some curvet∣tings
and caprioles, which did not at
<PB N="122" REF="127"/>
all discompose the rider, who, address∣ing
himself to the serjeant, “Friend,
said he, you ought to teach your drum∣mer
better manners. I would chas∣tise
the fellow on the spot for his in∣solence,
were it not out of the re∣spect
I bear to his majesty's service.”
“Respect mine a—! (cried this
ferocious commander) what, d'ye
think to frighten us with your pew∣ter
pisspot on your scull, and your
lacquer'd potlid on your arm? get
out of the way and be damned, or
I'll raise with my halbert such a clut∣ter
upon your target, that you'll re∣member
it the longest day you have to
live.” At that instant, Crabshaw arriv∣ing
upon Gilbert, “So rascal, said Sir
Launcelot, you are returned. Go and
beat in that scoundrel's drum-head.”</P>
<P>“The squire, who saw no wea∣pons
of offence about the drummer
but a sword, which he hoped the
owner durst not draw; and being re∣solved
to exert himself in making a∣tonement
for his desertion, advanced
to execute his master's orders: but
<PB N="123" REF="128"/>
Gilbert, who liked not the noise,
refused to proceed in the ordinary
way. Then the squire turning his
tail to the drummer, he advanced
in a retrograde motion, and with
one kick of his heels, not only broke
the drum into a thousand pieces,
but laid the drummer in the mire,
with such a blow upon his hip-bone,
that he halted all the days of his
life. The recruits, perceiving the
discomfiture of their leader, armed
themselves with stones; the serjeant
raised his halbert in a posture of de∣fence,
and immediately a severe ac∣tion
ensued. By this time, Crab∣shaw
had drawn his sword, and be∣gun
to lay about him like a devil
incarnate; but, in a little time, he
was saluted by a volley of stones,
one of which knocked out two of
his grinders, and brought him to
the earth, where he had like to
have found no quarter; for the
whole company crowded about him,
with their cudgels brandished; and
perhaps he owed his preservation to
<PB N="124" REF="129"/>
their pressing so hard that they hin∣dered
one another from using their
weapons. Sir Launcelot, seeing with
indignation the unworthy treatment
his squire had received, and scorning
to stain his launce with the blood of
plebeians, instead of couching it in
the rest, seized it by the middle, and
fetching one blow at the serjeant,
broke in twain the halbert which
he had raised as a quarter-staff for his
defence. The second stroke encoun∣tered
his pate, which being the hard∣est
part about him, sustained the shock
without damage; but the third, light∣ing
on his ribs, he honoured the giver
with immediate prostration. The
general being thus overthrown, Sir
Launcelot advanced to the relief of
Crabshaw, and handled his weapon
so effectually, that the whole body
of the enemy were disabled or rout∣ed,
before one cudgel had touched
the carcass of the fallen squire. As
for the corporal, instead of stand∣ing
by his commanding officer, he
had overleaped the hedge, and run
<PB N="125" REF="130"/>
to the constable of an adjoining vil∣lage
for assistance. Accordingly, be∣fore
Crabshaw could be properly
remounted, the peace officer arriv∣ed
with his posse; and by the cor∣poral
was charged with Sir Launce∣lot
and his squire, as two highway∣men.
The constable, astonished at
the martial figure of the knight, and
intimidated at sight of the havock he
had made, contented himself with
standing at a distance, displaying the
badge of his office, and reminding
the knight that he represented his
majesty's person. Sir Launcelot, see∣ing
the poor man in great agitation,
assured him that his design was to en∣force,
not violate the laws of his
country; and that he and his squire
would attend him to the next justice
of the peace; but, in the mean time,
he, in his turn, charged the peace∣officer
with the serjeant and the drum∣mer,
who had begun the fray. The
justice had been a pettifogger, and
was a sycophant to a nobleman in the
neighbourhood, who had a post at
<PB N="126" REF="131"/>
court. He therefore thought he
should oblige his patron, by shew∣ing
his respect for <HI>the military;</HI> and
treated our knight with the most
boorish insolence; but refused to
admit him into his house, until he
had surrendered all his weapons of
offence to the constable. Sir Launce∣lot
and his squire being found the
aggressors, the justice insisted upon
making out their mittimus, if they
did not find bail immediately; and
could hardly be prevailed upon to
agree that they should remain at
the house of the constable, who,
being a publican, undertook to keep
them in safe custody, until the knight
could write to his steward. Mean
while he was bound over to the peace;
and the serjeant with his drummer
were told they had a good action a∣gainst
him for assault and battery, ei∣ther
by information or indictment.
They were not, however, so sond of
the law as the justice seemed to be.
Their sentiments had taken a turn in
favour of Sir Launcelot, during the
<PB N="127" REF="132"/>
course of his examination, by which
it appeared that he was really a gen∣tleman
of fashion and fortune; and
they resolved to compromise the af∣fair
without the intervention of his
worship. Accordingly, the serjeant
repaired to the constable's house,
where the knight was lodged; and
humbled himself before his honour,
protesting with many oaths, that if
he had known his quality he would
have beaten the drummer's brains a∣bout
his ears, for presuming to give
his honour or his horse the least di∣sturbance;
thof the fellow, he be∣lieved,
was sufficiently punished in
being a cripple for life. Sir Launce∣lot
admitted of his apologies; and
taking compassion on the fellow who
had suffered so severely for his folly,
resolved to provide for his mainte∣nance.
Upon the representation of
the parties to the justice, the war∣rant
was next day discharged; and
the knight returned to his own house,
attended by the serjeant and the drum∣mer
mounted on horseback, the
<PB N="128" REF="133"/>
recruits being left to the corporal's
charge.</P>
<P>“The halberdeer found the good
effects of Sir Launcelot's liberality;
and his companion being rendered
unfit for his majesty's service by the
heels of Gilbert, is now entertained
at Greavesbury-hall, where he will
probably remain for life. As for
Crabshaw, his master gave him to
understand, that if he did not think
him pretty well chastised for his
presumption and flight by the dis∣cipline
he had undergone in the last
two adventures, he would turn him
out of his service with disgrace. Ti∣mothy
said he believed it would be
the greatest favour he could do him
to turn him out of a service in which
he knew he should be rib-roasted
every day, and murdered at last. In
this situation were things at Greaves∣bury-hall
about a month ago, when
I crossed the country to Ferry-bridge,
where I met my uncle: probably,
this is the first incident of their second
excursion; for the distance between
<PB N="129" REF="134"/>
this here house and Sir Launcelot's
estate, does not exceed fourscore or
ninety miles.”</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the reader will perceive that
in some cases madness is catching.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Clarke having made an end
of his narrative, the surgeon
thanked him for the entertainment he
had received; and Mr. Ferret shrug∣ged
up his shoulders in silent disap∣probation.
As for captain Crowe,
who used at such pauses to pour in a
broadside of dismembered remarks,
linked together like chain-shot, he
spoke not a syllable for some time;
but, lighting a fresh pipe at the can∣dle,
began to roll such voluminous
clouds of smoke as in an instant filled
the whole apartment, and rendered
himself invisible to the whole com∣pany.
Though he thus shrouded
himself from their view, he did not
long remain concealed from their
hearing. They first heard a strange
<PB N="130" REF="135"/>
dissonant cackle, which the doctor
knew to be a sea-laugh, and this was
followed by an eager exclamation of
“Rare pastime, strike my yards and
top-masts!—I've a good mind—why
shouldn't—many a losing voyage I've—smite
my taffrel but I wool—” By
this time, he had relaxed so much
in his sumigation, that the tip of
his nose and one eye reappeared;
and as he had drawn his wig for∣wards
so as to cover his whole fore∣head,
the figure that now saluted
their eyes was much more ferocious
and terrible than the fire-breathing
chimaera of the antients. Notwith∣standing
this dreadful appearance,
there was no indignation in his heart;
but, on the contrary, an agreeable
curiosity, which he was determined to
gratify. Addressing himself to Mr.
Fillet, “Prithee, doctor (said he)
can'st tell, whether a man, without
being rated a lord or a baron, or what
d'ye call um, d'ye see, mayn't take
to the highway in the way of a fro∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k,
d'ye see?—adad! for my own
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>
part, brother, I'm resolved as how
to cruise a bit in the way of an ar∣rant—if
so be as I can't at once be
commander, mayhap I may be bore
upon the books as a petty officer or
the like, d'ye see.”</P>
<P>“Now, the Lord forbid! (cried
Clarke with tears in his eyes) I'd
rather see you dead than brought
to such a dilemma.” “Mayhap
thou would'st (answered the uncle);
for then, my lad, there would be
some picking——aha! do'st thou
tip me the traveller, my boy”——
Tom assured him he scorned any
such mercenary views. “I am only
concerned (said he) that you should
take any step that might tend to the
disgrace of yourself or your family;
and I say again I had rather die
than live to see you reckoned any
otherwise than compos”——“Die
and be damned! you shambling, half-timber'd
son of a——(cried the
choleric Crowe) do'st talk to me of
keeping a reckoning and compass!—
I could keep a reckoning, and box
<PB N="132" REF="137"/>
my compass, long enough before thy
keelstone was laid——Sam Crowe is
not come here to ask thy counsel how
to steer his course”—“Lord, sir, (re∣sumed
the nephew) consider what
people will say——all the world will
think you mad”—“Set thy heart at
ease, Tom, (cried the seaman) I'll
have a trip to and again in this here
channel. Mad! what then? I think
for my part one half of the nation is
mad—and the other not very sound—
I don't see why I han't as good a
right to be mad as another man——but,
doctor, as I was saying, I'd be
bound to you, if you would direct
me where I can buy that same tackle
that an arrant must wear. As for the
matter of the long pole headed with
iron, I'd never desire a better than a
good boat-hook; and I could make a
special good target of that there tin
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conce that holds the candle—mayhap
any blacksmith will hammer me a
scull-cap, d'ye see, out of an old brass
kettle: and I can call my horse by the
name of my ship, which was <HI>Mufti.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="138"/>
The surgeon was one of those
wags who can laugh inwardly, with∣out
exhibiting the least outward mark
of mirth or satisfaction. He at once
perceived the amusement which might
be drawn from this strange disposition
of the sailor, together with the most
likely means which could be used to
divert him from such an extravagant
pursuit. He therefore tipped Clarke
the wink with one side of his face,
while the other was very gravely turn∣ed
to the captain, whom he address∣ed
to this effect: “It is not far from
hence to Sheffield, where you might
be fitted compleatly in half-a-day—
then you must wake your armour
in church or chappel, and be dubbed.
As for this last ceremony, it may be
performed by any person whatso∣ever.
Don Quixote was dubbed by
his landlord; and there are many
instances on record, of errants oblig∣ing
and compelling the next person
they met to cross their shoulders, and
dub them knights. I myself would
undertake to be your godfather; and
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
I have interest enough to procure the
keys of the parish church that stands
hard by; besides, this is the eve of
St. Martin, who was himself a knight∣errant,
and therefore a proper patron
to a noviciate. I wish we could bor∣row
Sir Launcelot's armour for the
occasion.”</P>
<P>Crowe, being struck with this hint,
started up, and laying his fingres on his
lips to enjoin silence, walked off softly
on his tiptoes, to listen at the door of
our knight's apartment, and judge
whether or not he was asleep. Mr.
Fillet took this opportunity to tell his
nephew, that it would be in vain for
him to combat this humour with rea∣son
and argument: but the most ef∣fectual
way of diverting him from the
plan of knight-errantry would be, to
frighten him heartily while he should
keep his vigil in the church. To∣wards
the accomplishment of which
purpose he craved the assistance of the
misanthrope as well as the nephew.
Clarke seemed to relish the scheme;
and observed that his uncle, though
<PB N="135" REF="140"/>
endued with courage enough to face
any human danger, had at bottom a
strong fund of superstition, which he
had acquired, or at least improved, in
the course of a sea-life. Ferret, who
perhaps would not have gone ten paces
out of his road to save Crowe from the
gallows, nevertheless, engaged as an
auxiliary, merely in hope of seeing a
fellow-creature miserable; and even
undertook to be the principal agent in
this adventure. For this office, in∣deed,
he was better qualified than they
could have imagined: in the bundle
which he kept under his great coat,
there was, together with divers nos∣trums,
a small vial of liquid phospho∣rus,
sufficient, as he had already ob∣served,
to frighten a whole neigh∣bourhood
out of their senses. In order
to concert the previous measures, with∣out
being overheard, these confede∣rates
retired with a candle and lan∣thorn
into the stable; and their backs
were scarce turned, when captain
Crowe came in loaded with pieces of
the knight's armour, which he had
<PB N="136" REF="141"/>
conveyed from the apartment of Sir
Launcelot, whom he had left fast
asleep.</P>
<P>Understanding that the rest of the
company were gone out for a moment,
he could not resist the inclination he
felt of communicating his intention to
the landlady, who, with her daugh∣ter,
had been too much engaged in
preparing Crabshaw's supper, to know
the purport of their conversation. The
good woman, being informed of the
captain's design to remain alone all
night in the church, began to oppose
it with all her rhetorick. She said it
was setting his Maker at defiance, and
a wilful running into temptation. She
assured him all the country knew that
the church was haunted by spirits and
hobgoblins: that lights had been seen
in every corner of it; and a tall wo∣man
in white had one night appeared
upon the top of the tower: that dread∣ful
shrieks were often heard to come
from the south aile, where a mur∣dered
man had been buried: that she
herself had seen the cross on the stee∣ple
<PB N="137" REF="142"/>
all a-fire; and one evening as she
passed a horse-back close by the stile
at the entrance into the church-yard,
the horse stood still, sweating and
trembling, and had no power to pro∣ceed
until she had repeated the Lord's
Prayer.</P>
<P>These remarks made a strong im∣pression
on the imagination of Crowe,
who asked, in some confusion, if she
had got that same prayer in print. She
made no answer; but reaching the
prayer-book from a shelf, and turning
up the leaf, put it into his hand: then
the captain, having adjusted his spec∣tacles,
began to read or rather spell
aloud with equal eagerness and solem∣nity.
He had refreshed his memory
so well as to remember the whole;
when the doctor, returning with his
companions, gave him to understand
that he had procured the key of the
chancel, where he might watch his
armour as well as in the body of the
church; and that he was ready to
conduct him to the spot. Crowe was
not now quite so forward as he had
<PB N="138" REF="143"/>
appeared before to atchieve this ad∣venture.
He began to start objections
with respect to the borrowed armour:
he wanted to stipulate the comforts of
a can of flip, and a candle's end, dur∣ing
his vigil; and hinted something
of the damage he might sustain from
your malicious imps of darkness.</P>
<P>The doctor told him, the constitu∣tions
of chivalry absolutely required
that he should be left in the dark
alone, and fasting, to spend the night
in pious meditations; but if he had
any fears which disturbed his con∣science,
he had much better desist,
and give up all thoughts of knight-er∣rantry,
which could not consist with
the least shadow of apprehension. The
captain, stung by this remark, re∣plied
not a word; but gathering up
the armour into a bundle, threw it on
his back, and set out for the place of
probation, preceded by Clarke with
the lanthorn. When they arrived at
the church, Fillet, who had procured
the key from the sexton, who was his
patient, opened the door, and con∣ducted
<PB N="139" REF="144"/>
our novice into the middle of
the chancel, where the armour was
deposited. Then bidding Crowe draw
his hanger, committed him to the
protection of heaven, assuring him he
would come back, and find him ei∣ther
dead or alive by day-break, and
perform the remaining part of the ce∣remony.
So saying, he and the other
associates shook him by the hand and
took their leave, after the surgeon had
tilted up the lanthorn, in order to take
a view of his visage, which was pale
and haggard.</P>
<P>Before the door was locked upon
him, he called aloud, “Hilloa! doc∣tor,
hip—another word, d'ye see—”
They forthwith returned, to know
what he wanted, and found him al∣ready
in a sweat. “Heark ye, bro∣ther
(said he, wiping his face) I do
suppose as how one may pass away the
time in whistling the black joke, or
singing black-ey'd Susan, or some such
sorrowful ditty.” “By no means,
(cried the doctor) such pastimes are
neither suitable to the place, nor the
<PB N="140" REF="145"/>
occasion, which is altogether a reli∣gious
exercise. If you have got any
psalms by heart, you may sing a stave
or two, or repeat the doxology.”
“Would I had Tom Laverick here,
(replied our novitiate) he would sing
you anthems like a sea-mew—a had
been a clerk a-shore—many's the time
and often I've given him a rope's end
for singing psalms in the larboard
watch—would I had hired the son of
a bitch to have taught me a cast of
his office—but it cannot be holp, bro∣ther—if
we can't go large, we must
haul upon a wind, as the saying is—
if we can't sing, we must pray.”
The company again left him to his
devotion, and returned to the public
house, in order to execute the essential
part of their project.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In which the knight resumes his im∣portance.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR Fillet having borrowed
a couple of sheets from the land∣lady,
dressed the misanthrope and Tom
Clarke in ghostly apparel, which was
re-inforced by a few drops of liquid
phosphorus, from Ferret's phial, rub∣bed
on the fore-heads of the two ad∣venturers.
Thus equipped they re∣turned
to the church with their con∣ductor,
who entered with them softly
at an aile which was opposite to a
place where the novice kept watch.
They stole unperceived through the
body of the church; and though it
was so dark that they could not dis∣tinguish
the captain with the eye, they
heard the sound of his steps, as he
walked backwards and forwards on
the pavement with uncommon expe∣dition,
and an ejaculation now and
then escape in a murmur from his
lips.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="147"/>
The triumvirate having taken their
station, with a large pew in their front,
the two ghosts uncovered their heads,
which, by help of the phosphorus, ex∣hibited
a pale and lambent flame, ex∣tremely
dismal and ghastly to the
view; then Ferret, in a squeaking tone
exclaimed, “Samuel Crowe! Samuel
Crowe!” The captain hearing him∣self
accosted in this manner, at such a
time, and in such a place, replied,
“Hilloah;” and turning his eyes to∣wards
the quarter whence the voice
seemed to proceed, beheld the terrible
apparition. This no sooner saluted
his view, than his hair bristled up, his
knees began to knock, and his teeth to
chatter, while he cried aloud, “In the
name of God, where are you bound,
ho?” To this hail, the misanthrope
answered, “We are the spirits of
thy grandmother Jane and thy aunt
Bridget.”</P>
<P>At mention of these names, Crowe's
terrors began to give way to his resent∣ment,
and he pronounced in a quick
tone of surprize, mixed with indigna∣tion,
<PB N="143" REF="148"/>
“What d'ye want? what d'ye
want? what d'ye want, ho?” The
spirit replied, “We are sent to warn
thee of thy fate.” “From whence,
ho?” cried the captain, whose choler
had by this time well nigh triumphed
over his fear. “From heaven,” said
the voice. “Ye lie, ye b—s of hell!
(did our novice exclaim) ye are dam∣ned
for heaving me out of my right,
five fathom and a half by the lead, in
burning brimstone. Don't I see the
blue flames come out of your hawse∣holes—mayhap
you may be the devil
himself for aught I know——but, I
trust in the Lord, d'ye see—I never
disrated a kinsman, d'ye see; so don't
come along side of me—put about on
th'other tack, d'ye see—you need not
clap hard aweather, for you'll soon
get to hell again with a flowing sail.”</P>
<P>So saying, he had recourse to his
Pater-noster; but perceiving the ap∣paritions
approach, he thundered out,
“Avast,—avast—sheer off, ye babes
of hell, or I'll be foul of your fore∣lights.”
He accordingly sprung for∣wards
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>
with his hanger, and very pro∣bably
would have set the spirits on
their way to the other world, had not
he fallen over a pew in the dark, and
intangled himself so much among the
benches, that he could not imme∣diately
recover his footing. The
triumvirate took this opportunity to
retire; and such was the precipitation
of Ferret in his retreat, that he en∣countered
a post, by which his right
eye sustained considerable damage: a
circumstance which induced him to
inveigh bitterly against his own folly,
as well as the impertinence of his
companions, who had inveigled him
into such a troublesome adventure.
Neither he nor Clarke could be pre∣vailed
upon to revisit the novice. The
doctor himself thought his disease was
desperate; and, mounting his horse,
returned to his own habitation.</P>
<P>Ferret, finding all the beds in the
public house were occupied, composed
himself to sleep in a windsor-chair at
the chimney-corner; and Mr. Clarke,
whose disposition was extremely amo∣rous,
<PB N="145" REF="150"/>
resolved to renew his practices on
the heart of Dolly. He had reconnoitred
the apartments in which the bodies of
the knight and his squire were depo∣sited,
and discovered close by the top
of the stair-case a sort of a closet or
hovel just large enough to contain a
truckle-bed, which, from some other
particulars, he supposed to be the bed-chamber
of his beloved Dolly, who
had by this time retired to her repose.
Full of this idea, and instigated by
the daemon of desire, Mr. Thomas
crept softly up stairs; and lifting the
latch of the closet-door, his heart be∣gan
to palpitate with joyous expecta∣tion:
but before he could breathe the
gentle effusions of his love, the sup∣posed
damsel started up, and seizing
him by the collar with an Herculean
gripe, uttered, in the voice of Crab∣shaw,
“It wa'n't for nothing that I
dreamed of Newgate, sirrah; but
I'd have thee to know, an arrant
squire is not to be robbed by such a
peddling thief as thee—here I'll howld
thee vast, and the devil were in thy
<PB N="146" REF="151"/>
doublet—help! murder! vire!
help!”</P>
<P>It was impossible for Mr. Clarke to
disengage himself, and equally im∣practicable
to speak in his own vindi∣cation;
so that here he stood trem∣bling
and half throttled, until the
whole house being alarmed, the land∣lady
and her ostler ran up stairs with
a candle. When the light rendered
objects visible, an equal astonishment
prevailed on all sides: Crabshaw was
confounded at sight of Mr. Clarke,
whose person he well knew; and re∣leasing
him instantly from his grasp,
“Bodikins! (cried he) I believe as
how this hawse is haunted—who
thought to meet with Measter Laayer
Clarke at midnight, and so far from
hoam.” The landlady could not
comprehend the meaning of this en∣counter;
nor could Tom conceive
how Crabshaw had transported him∣self
hither from the room below, in
which he saw him quietly reposed.
Yet nothing was more easy than to
explain this mystery: the apartment
<PB N="147" REF="152"/>
below was the chamber which the
hostess and her daughter reserved for
their own convenience; and this
particular having been intimated to
the squire while he was at supper, he
had resigned the bed quietly, and been
conducted hither in the absence of
the company. Tom, recollecting
himself as well as he could, pro∣fessed
himself of Crabshaw's opini∣on,
that the house was haunted,
declaring that he could not well ac∣count
for his being there in the dark;
and leaving those that were assem∣bled
to discuss this knotty point, re∣tired
down stairs, in hope of meeting
with his charmer, whom accordingly
he found in the kitchen just risen,
and wrapped in a loose dishabille.</P>
<P>The noise of Crabshaw's cries had
awakened and aroused his master,
who, rising suddenly in the dark,
snatched up his sword that lay by
his bed-side, and hastened to the
scene of tumult, where all their
mouths were opened at once, to ex∣plain
the cause of the disturbance,
<PB N="148" REF="153"/>
and make an apology for breaking
his honour's rest. He said nothing;
but taking the candle in his hand,
beckoned to his squire to follow him
into his apartment, resolving to arm
and take horse immediately. Crab∣shaw
understood his meaning; and
while he shuffled on his cloaths,
yawning hideously all the while,
wished the lawyer at the devil for
having visited him so unseasonably;
and even cursed himself for the noise
he had made, in consequence of which
he foresaw he should now be obliged
to forfeit his night's rest, and travel
in the dark, exposed to the inclemen∣cies
of the weather. “Pox rot thee,
Tom Clarke, for a wicked laayer!
(said he to himself) hadst thou been
hanged at Bartlemey-tide, I should
this night have s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept in peace, that I
should—an I would there was a
blister on this plaguy tongue of mine
for making such a hollowballoo; that
I do—five gallons of cold water has
my poor belly been drenched with
since night fell; so as my reins and
<PB N="149" REF="154"/>
my liver are all one as if they were
turned into ice, and my whole har∣slet
shakes and shivers like a vial of
quick-silver. I have been dragged,
half drowned like a rotten ewe, from
the bottom of a river; and who
knows but I may be next dragged
quite dead from the bottom of a
coal-pit—if so be as I am, I shall
go to hell to be sure, for being con∣sarned
like in my own moorder;
that I will: so I will: for a plague
on it, I had no business with the va∣garies
of this crazy-peated measter
of mine, a pox on him, say I.”</P>
<P>He had just finished this soliloquy
as he entered the apartment of his
master, who desired to know what
was become of his armour. Timo∣thy,
understanding that it had been
left in the room when the knight
undressed, began to scratch his head
in great perplexity; and at last de∣clared
it as his opinion that it must
have been carried off by witchcraft.
Then he related his adventure with
Tom Clarke, who he said was con∣veyed
<PB N="150" REF="155"/>
to his bedside he knew not
how; and concluded, with affirm∣ing
they were no better than Pa∣pishes,
who did not believe in witch∣craft.
Sir Launcelot could not help
smiling at his simplicity; but assum∣ing
a peremptory air, he commanded
him to fetch the armour without de∣lay,
that he might afterwards saddle
the horses, in order to prosecute their
journey. Timothy retired in great
tribulation to the kitchen, where
finding the misanthrope, whom the
noise had also disturbed, and still im∣pressed
with the notion of his being
a conjurer, he offered him a shilling
if he would cast a figure, and let him
know what was become of his ma∣ster's
armour.</P>
<P>Ferret, in hope of producing more
mischief, informed him without hesi∣tation,
that one of the company had
conveyed it into the chancel of the
church, where he would now find
it deposited; at the same time pre∣senting
him with the key, which

Mr. Fillet had left in his custody.
The squire, who was none of those
who set hobgoblins at defiance, be∣ing
afraid to enter the church alone
at these hours, bargained with the
ostler to accompany and light him
with a lanthorn. Thus attended, he
advanced to the place, where the
armour lay in a heap, and loaded it
upon the back of his attendant with∣out
molestation, the launce being
shouldered over the whole. In
this equipage they were just going
to retire, when the ostler hearing a
noise at some distance, wheeled a∣bout
with such velocity, that one
end of the spear saluting Crabshaw's
pate, the poor squire measured his
length on the ground; and crushing
the lanthorn in his fall, the light was
extinguished. The other, terrified
at these effects of his own sudden
motion, threw down his burthen,
and would have betaken himself to
flight, had not Crabshaw laid fast
hold on his leg, that he himself
might not be deserted. The sound
<PB N="152" REF="157"/>
of the pieces clattering on the pave∣ment,
roused captain Crowe from a
trance or slumber in which he had
lain since the apparition vanished;
and he hollowed, or rather bellow∣ed,
with vast vociferation. Timo∣thy
and his friend were so intimi∣dated
by this terrific strain, that
they thought no more of the ar∣mour,
but ran home arm in arm,
and appeared in the kitchen with
all the marks of horror and conster∣nation.</P>
<P>When Sir Launcelot came forth
wrapped in his cloak, and demanded
his arms, Crabshaw declared that
the devil had them in possession;
and this assertion was confirmed by
the ostler, who pretended to know
the devil by his roar. Ferret sat in
his corner, maintaining the most
mortifying silence, and enjoying the
impatience of the knight, who in
vain requested an explanation of this
mystery. At length his eyes began
to lighten, when seizing Crabshaw
in one hand, and the ostler in the
<PB N="153" REF="158"/>
other, he swore by heaven he would
dash their souls out, and raze the
house to the foundation, if they did
not instantly disclose the particulars
of this transaction. The good wo∣man
fell on her knees, protesting, in
the name of the Lord, that she was
innocent as the child unborn, thof
she had lent the captain a Prayer
Book to learn the Lord's Prayer, a
lanthorn and candle to light him to
the church, and a couple of clean
sheets for the use of the other gen∣tlemen.
The knight was more and
more puzzled by this declaration;
when Mr. Clarke, coming into the
kitchen, presented himself with a
low obeisance to his old patron.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot's anger was imme∣diately
converted into surprize. He
set at liberty the squire and the
ostler; and stretching out his hand
to the lawyer, “My good friend
Clarke, (said he) how came you
hither? Can you solve this knotty
point which hath involved us all in
such confusion?”</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="159"/>
Tom forthwith began a very cir∣cumstantial
recapitulation of what
had happened to his uncle; in what
manner he had been disappointed
of the estate; how he had acciden∣tally
seen his honour, been ena∣moured
of his character, and be∣come
ambitious of following his ex∣ample.
Then he related the par∣ticulars
of the plan which had been
laid down to divert him from his
design, and concluded with assuring
the knight, that the captain was a
very honest man, though he seemed
to be a little disordered in his intel∣lects.
“I believe it, (replied Sir
Launcelot): madness and honesty are
not incompatible—indeed I feel it by
experience.”</P>
<P>Tom proceeded to ask pardon, in
his uncle's name, for his having
made so free with the knight's ar∣mour;
and begged his honour, for
the love of God, would use his au∣thority
with Crowe that he might quit
all thoughts of knight-errantry, for
which he was by no means quali∣fied;
<PB N="155" REF="160"/>
for being totally ignorant of
the laws of the land, he would be
continually committing trespasses, and
bring himself into trouble. He
said in case he should prove refrac∣tory,
he might be apprehended by
virtue of a friendly warrant, for
having feloniously carried off the
knight's accoutrements. “Taking
away another man's moveables, (said
he) and personal goods against the
will of the owner, is <HI>furtum</HI> and fe∣lony
according to the statute: dif∣ferent
indeed from robbery, which
implies putting in fear on the king's
highway, <HI>in alta via regia violenter,
&amp; felonice captum &amp; asportatum in
magnum terrorem, &amp;c.</HI> for if the rob∣bery
be laid in the indictment as done
<HI>in quadam via pedestri,</HI> in a foot-path,
the offender will not be ousted of
his clergy. It must be <HI>in alta via
regia;</HI> and your honour will please
to take notice, that robberies com∣mitted
on the river Thames, are ad∣judged
as done <HI>in alta via regia;</HI> for
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
the king's highstream is all the same
as the king's highway.”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot could not help smil∣ing
at Tom's learned investigation.
He congratulated him on the pro∣gress
he had made in the study of
the law. He expressed his concern
at the strange turn the captain had
taken; and promised to use his in∣fluence
in persuading him to desist
from the preposterous design he had
formed. The lawyer thus assured,
repaired immediately to the church,
accompanied by the squire, and held
a parley with his uncle, who, when
he understood that the knight in per∣son
desired a conference, surrender∣ed
up the arms quietly, and return∣ed
to the publick-house. Sir Laun∣celot
received the honest seaman with
his usual complacency; and perceiv∣ing
great discomposure in his looks,
said, he was sorry to hear he had
passed such a disagreeable night to so
little purpose. Crowe, having re∣cruited
his spirits with a bumper of
brandy, thanked him for his con∣cern
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>
and observed that he had pas∣sed
many a hard night in his time;
but such another as this, he would
not be bound to weather for the
command of the whole British navy.
“I have seen Davy Jones in the
shape of a blue flame, d'ye see, hop∣ping
to and fro, on the fpritsail yard
arm; and I've seen your Jacks o'the
Lanthorn, and Wills o'the Wisp,
and many such spirits, both by sea
and land: but, to-night I've been
boarded by all the devils and damn'd
souls in hell, squeaking and squal∣ling,
and glimmering and glaring.
Bounce, went the door—crack, went
the pew—crash, came the tackle—white-sheeted
ghosts dancing in one
corner by the glow-worm's light—black
devils hobbling in another—Lord,
have mercy upon us! and I
was hailed, Tom, I was, by my
grand-mother Jane, and my aunt
Bridget, d'ye see—a couple of damn'd
—but they're roasting; that's one
comfort, my lad.”</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="163"/>
When he had thus disburthened
his conscience, Sir Launcelot intro∣duced
the subject of the new occu∣pation
at which he aspired. “I
understand, said he, that you are
desirous of treading the paths of er∣rantry,
which I assure you, are thor∣ny
and troublesome. Nevertheless,
as your purpose is to exercise your
humanity and benevolence, so your
ambition is commendable. But to∣wards
the practice of chivalry, there
is something more required than
the virtues of courage and generosi∣ty.
A knight-errant ought to un∣derstand
the sciences, to be master of
ethics or morality, to be well versed
in theology, a complete casuist, and
minutely acquainted with the laws
of his country. He should not only
be patient of cold, hunger, and fa∣tigue,
righteous, just, and valiant;
but also chaste, religious, tempe∣rate,
polite, and conversable; and
have all his passions under the rein,
except love, whose empire he should
submissively acknowledge. He said,
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
this was the very essence of chivalry,
and no man had ever made such a
profession of arms, without having
first placed his affection upon some
beauteous object, for whose honour,
and at whose command, he would
chearfully encounter the most dread∣ful
perils.</P>
<P>He took notice that nothing could
be more irregular than the manner
in which Crowe had attempted to
keep his vigil: for he had never
served his noviciate—he had not
prepared himself with abstinence and
prayer—he had not provided a qua∣lified
godfather for the ceremony of
dubbing—he had no armour of his
own to wake; but, on the very thre∣shold
of chivalry, which is the per∣fection
of justice, had unjustly pur∣loined
the arms of another knight:
that this was a meer mockery of a
religious institution; and therefore
unpleasing in the sight of heaven;
witness, the demons and hobgoblins
that were permitted to disturb and
torment him in his trial.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="165"/>
Crowe having listened to these re∣marks,
with earnest attention, re∣plied,
after some hesitation: “I am
bound to you, brother, for your kind
and christian counsel—I doubt as
how I've steered by a wrong chart,
d'ye see—as for the matter of the
sciences, to be sure, I know plain
sailing and mercator; and am an in∣different
good seamen, thof I say it
that should not say it: but as to all
the rest, no better than the viol
block or the geer capstan. Religion
I han't much over-hauled; and we
tars laugh at your polite conversa∣tion,
thof, mayhap, we can chaunt
a few ballads to keep the hands
awake in the night watch; then for
chastity, brother, I doubt that's not
to be expected in a sailor just come
a-shore, after a long voyage—sure
all those poor hearts won't be damn∣ed
for steering in the wake of na∣ture.
As for a sweet-heart, Bet
Mizen of St. Catherine's would fit
me to a hair—she and I are old
messmates; and—what signifies talk∣ing,
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>
brother, she knows already the
trim of my vessel, d'ye see.” He
concluded with saying, “He thought
he wa'n't too old to learn; and if Sir
Launcelot would take him in tow,
as his tender, he would stand by him
all weathers, and it should not cost
his consort a farthing's expence.”</P>
<P>The knight said, he did not think
himself of consequence enough to
have such a pupil; but should al∣ways
be ready to give him his best
advice, as a specimen of which he
exhorted him to weigh all the cir∣cumstances,
and deliberate calmly
and leisurely, before he actually en∣gaged
in such a boisterous profession,
assuring him that if, at the end of
three months, his resolution should
continue, he would take upon him∣self
the office of his instructor. In
the mean time, he gratified the ho∣stess
for his lodging, put on his ar∣mour,
took leave of the company,
and mounting Bronzomarte, proceed∣ed
southerly, being attended by his
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
squire Crabshaw, grumbling on the
back of Gilbert.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which is within a hair's breadth of
proving highly interesting.</HEAD>
<P>LEAVING captain Crowe and
his nephew for the present,
though they and even the misan∣thrope
will reappear in due season,
we are now obliged to attend the
progress of the knight, who pro∣ceeded
in a southerly direction, in∣sensible
of the storm that blew, as
well as of the darkness, which was
horrible. For some time Crrbshaw
ejaculated curses in silence; till at
length his anger gave way to his fear,
which waxed so strong upon him,
that he could no longer resist the
desire of alleviating it, by entering
into a conversation with his master.
By way of introduction, he gave
Gilbert the spur, directing him to∣wards
the flank of Bronzomarte,
<PB N="163" REF="168"/>
which he encountered with such a
shock, that the knight was almost
dismounted. When Sir Launcelot,
with some warmth, asked the rea∣son
of this attack, the squire replied
in these words: “The devil, (God
bless us) mun be playing his pranks
with Gilbert too, as sure as I'm a
living soul!—I'se wage a teaster,
the foul fiend has left the seaman,
and got into Gilbert, that he has
—when a has passed through an
ass and a horse, I'se marvel what
beast a will get into next.” “Pro∣bably
into a mule, (said the knight;)
in that case you will be in some
danger—but I can, at any time,
dispossess you with a horsewhip.”—
“Aye, aye, (answered Timothy)
your honour has a mortal good
hand at giving a flap with a fox's
tail, as the saying is—'tis a won∣derment
you did not try your hand
on that there wiseacre that stole
your honour's harness, and wants
to be an arrant with a murrain to
'un—Lord help his fool's head!
<PB N="164" REF="169"/>
it becomes him as a sow doth a cart∣saddle.”
“There is no guilt in
infirmity (said the knight;) I punish
the vicious only.” “I would your
honour would punish Gilbert then,
(cried the squire) for 'tis the most
vicious tuoad that ever I laid a leg
over—but as to that same sea∣faring
man, what may his distem∣per
be?” “Madness;” (answered
Sir Launcelot.) “Bodikins, (ex∣claimed
the squire) I doubt as how
other volks are leame of the same
leg—but a'n't vor such small gen∣try
as he to be mad: they mun
leave that to their betters.” “You
seem to hint at me, Crabshaw: do
you really think I am mad?” “I
may say as how I have looked your
honour in the mouth; and a sorry
dog should I be, if I did not know
your humours as well as I know
e'er a beast in the steable at Greaves∣bury-hall.”
“Since you are so
well acquainted with my madness,
(said the knight) what opinion have
you of yourself, who serve and fol∣low
<PB N="165" REF="170"/>
low a lunatic?” “I hope I han't
served your honour for nothing,
but I shall inherit some of your cast
vagaries—when your honour is
pleased to be mad, I should be very
sorry to be found right in my senses.
Timothy Crabshaw will never eat
the bread of unthankfulness—It
shall never be said of him that he
was wiser than his measter: as for
the matter of following a madman,
we may say your honour's face is
made of a fiddle; every one that
looks on you loves you.” This com∣pliment
the knight returned by saying,
“If my face is a fiddle, Crabshaw,
your tongue is a fiddle-stick that
plays upon it—yet your music is very
disagreeable—you don't keep time.”
“Nor you neither, measter, (cried
Timothy) or we shouldn't be here
wandering about under cloud of night,
like sheep-stealers, or evil spirits with
troubled consciences.”</P>
<P>Here the discourse was inter∣rupted
by a sudden disaster, in con∣sequence
of which the squire uttered
<PB N="166" REF="171"/>
an inarticulate roar that startled the
knight himself, who was very little
subject to the sensation of fear: but
his surprize was changed into vex∣ation
when he perceived Gilbert
without a rider passing by, and
kicking his heels with great agility.
He forthwith turned his steed, and,
riding back a few paces, found Crab∣shaw
rising from the ground. When
he asked what was become of his
horse, he answered in a whimpering
tone, “Horse! would I could once
see him fairly carrion for the hounds
—for my part I believe as how 'tis
no horse but a devil incarnate; and
yet I've been worse mounted, that I
have—I'd like to have rid a horse
that was foaled of an acorn.”</P>
<P>This accident happened in a hollow
way, overshadowed with trees, one of
which the storm had blown down, so
that it lay over the road, and one of
its boughs projecting horizontally,
encountered the squire as he trotted
along in the dark. Chancing to
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>
hitch under his long chin, he could
not disengage himself; but hung
suspended like a flitch of bacon;
while Gilbert, pushing forward, left
him dangling, and, by his aukward
gambols, seemed to be pleased with
the joke. This capricious animal
was not retaken without the perso∣nal
endeavours of the knight: for
Crabshaw absolutely refusing to budge
a foot from his honour's side, he
was obliged to alight, and fasten
Bronzomarte to a tree: then they
set out together, and with some dif∣ficulty
found Gilbert with his neck
stretched over a five barred gate,
snuffing up the morning-air. The
squire, however, was not remount∣ed,
without having first undergone
a severe reprehension from his mas∣ter,
who upbraided him with his
cowardice, threatened to chastise him
on the spot, and declared that he
would divorce his dastardly soul from
his body, should he ever be incom∣moded
or affronted with another in∣stance
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
of his base-born apprehension.
Though there was some risque in
carrying on the altercation at this
juncture, Timothy having bound up
his jaws, could not withstand the in∣clination
he had to confute his master.
He therefore, in a muttering ac∣cent,
protested that if the knight
would give him leave, he should
prove that his honour had tied a knot
with his tongue which he could not
untie with all his teeth. “How,
caitiff, (cried Sir Launcelot) pre∣sume
to contend with me in argu∣ment!”
“Your mouth is scarce
shut, (said the other) since you de∣clared
that a man was not to be pu∣nished
for madness, because it was
a distemper: now I will maintain
that cowardice is a distemper as well
as madness; for nobody would be
afraid if he could help it.” “There
is more logic in that remark (resumed
the knight) than I expected from your
clod-pate, Crabshaw: but I must ex∣plain
the difference between cowar∣dice
and madness. Cowardice, tho'
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
sometimes the effect of natural imbe∣cility,
is generally a prejudice of edu∣cation,
or bad habit contracted from
misinformation, or misapprehension,
and may certainly be cured by expe∣rience,
and the exercise of reason:
but this remedy cannot be applied in
madness, which is a privation or dis∣order
of reason itself.” “So is cow∣ardice,
as I'm a living soul, (ex∣claimed
the squire) don't you say a
man is frightened out of his senses?
for my peart, measter, I can neither
see nor hear, much less argufy when
I'm in such a quandary: where∣fore,
I believe, odds bodikins! that
cowardice and madness are both di∣stempers,
and differ no more than
the hot and cold fits of an ague.
When it teakes your honour, you're
all heat and fire and fury, Lord bless
us! but when it catches poor Tim,
he's cold and dead-hearted, he sheakes
and shivers like an aspen-leaf, that
he does.” “In that case, (an∣swered
the knight) I shall not punish
you for the distemper which you can∣not
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
help, but for engaging in a ser∣vice
exposed to perils, when you knew
your own infirmity: in the same
manner as a man deserves punishment,
who enlists himself for a soldier, while
he labours under any secret disease.”
“At that rate (said the squire) my
bread is like to be rarely buttered
o'both sides, I faith. But, I hope,
as by the blessing of God I have
run mad, so I shall in good time
grow valiant, under your honour's
precept and example.”</P>
<P>By this time a very disagreeable
night was succeeded by a fair, bright
morning, and a market-town appear∣ed
at the distance of three or four
miles, when Crabshaw, having no
longer the fear of hobgoblins before
his eyes, and being moreover cheared
by the sight of a place where he
hoped to meet with comfortable en∣tertainment,
began to talk big, to ex∣patiate
on the folly of being afraid,
and finally set all danger at defiance;
when all of a sudden he was present∣ed
with an opportunity of putting in
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
practice those new adopted maxims.
In an opening between two lanes,
they perceived a gentleman's coach
stopped by two highwaymen on
horseback, one of whom advanced to
reconnoitre and keep the coast clear,
while the other exacted contribution
from the travellers in the coach.
He who acted as centinel, no sooner
saw our adventurer appearing from
the lane, than he rode up with a
pistol in his hand, and ordered him to
halt on pain of immediate death.</P>
<P>To this peremptory mandate the
knight made no other reply than
charging him with such impetuosi∣ty
that he was unhorsed in a twink∣ling,
and lay sprawling on the ground,
seemingly sore bruised with his fall.
Sir Launcelot commanding Timothy
to alight and secure the prisoner,
couched his launce, and rode full
speed at the other highwayman, who
was not a little disturbed at sight of
such an apparition. Nevertheless, he
fired his pistol without effect; and,
clapping spurs to his horse, fled away
<PB N="172" REF="177"/>
at full gallop. The knight pursued
him with all the speed that Bronzo∣marte
could exert; but the robber
being mounted on a swift hunter,
kept him at a distance; and, after a
chace of several miles, escaped thro'
a wood so entangled with coppice,
that Sir Launcelot thought proper to
desist. He then, for the first time,
recollected the situation in which he
had left the other thief, and remem∣bering
to have heard a female shriek,
as he passed by the coach-window,
resolved to return with all expedition,
that he might make a proffer of his
service to the lady, according to the
obligation of knight-errantry. But
he had lost his way; and after an
hour's ride, during which he traversed
many a field, and circled divers hedges,
he found himself in the market-town
aforementioned. Here the first object
that presented itself to his eyes, was
Crabshaw, on foot, surrounded by a
mob, tearing his hair, stamping with
his feet, and roaring out in manifest
distraction, “Shew me the mayor,
<PB N="173" REF="178"/>
(for the love of God) shew me the
mayor!—O Gilbert, Gilbert! a mur∣rain
take thee, Gilbert! sure thou
wast foaled for my destruction!”</P>
<P>From these exclamations, and the
antic dress of the squire, the people,
not without reason, concluded that
the poor soul had lost his wits; and
the beadle was just going to secure
him, when the knight interposed, and
at once attracted the whole attention
of the populace. Timothy, seeing
his master, fell down on his knees,
crying “The thief has run away with
Gilbert—you may pound me into a
peast, as the saying is: but now I'se
as mad as your worship; an't afeard
of the devil and all his works.” Sir
Launcelot desiring the beadle would
forbear, was instantly obeyed by that
officer, who had no inclination to put
the authority of his place in competi∣tion
with the power of such a figure
armed at all points, mounted on a
fiery steed, and ready for the combat.
He ordered Crabshaw to attend him
to the next inn, where he alighted;
<PB N="174" REF="179"/>
then taking him into a separate apart∣ment,
demanded an explanation of
the unconnected words he had uttered.
The squire was in such agitation, that,
with infinite difficulty, and by dint of
a thousand different questions, his
master learned the adventure to this
effect: Crabshaw, according to Sir
Launcelot's command, had alighted
from his horse, and drawn his cutlass,
in hope of intimidating the discom∣fited
robber into a tame surrender,
though he did not at all relish the na∣ture
of the service: but the thief was
neither so much hurt, nor so tame as
Timothy had imagined. He started
on his feet with his pistol still in his
hand; and presenting it to the squire,
swore with dreadful imprecations, that
he would blow his brains out in an
instant. Crabshaw, unwilling to ha∣zard
the trial of this experiment, turn∣ed
his back, and fled with great pre∣cipitation;
while the robber, whose
horse had run away, mounted Gilbert,
and rode off across the country. It
was at this period, that two footmen
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
belonging to the coach, who had
stayed behind to take their morning's
whet, at the inn where they lodged,
came up to the assistance of the la∣dies,
armed with blunderbusses; and
the carriage proceeded, leaving Ti∣mothy
alone in distraction and de∣spair.
He knew not which way to
turn, and was afraid of remaining on
the spot, lest the robbers should come
back and revenge themselves upon
him for the disappointment they had
undergone. In this distress, the first
thought that occurred, was to make
the best of his way to the town, and
demand the assistance of the civil
magistrate towards the retrieval of
what he had lost: a design which he
executed in such a manner, as justly
entailed upon him the imputation of
lunacy.</P>
<P>While Timothy stood fronting the
window, and answering the interro∣gations
of his master, he suddenly
exclaimed, “Bodikins! there's Gil∣bert!”
and sprung into the street with
incredible agility. There finding his
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>
strayed companion brought back by
one of the footmen who attended the
coach, he imprinted a kiss on his
forehead; and hanging about his neck,
with the tears in his eyes, hailed his
return with the following salutation:
“Art thou come back, my darling?
ah Gilbert, Gilbert! a pize upon thee!
thou hadst like to have been a dear
Gilbert to me! how couldst thou
break the heart of thy old friend,
who has known thee from a colt?
seven years next grass have I fed thee
and bred thee; provided thee with
sweet hay, delicate corn, and fresh
litter, that thou mought lie warm,
dry, and confortable. Ha'n't I cur∣rycombed
thy carcase 'till it was as
sleek as a sloe, and cherished thee as
the apple of mine eye? for all that
thou hast played me an hundred
dog's-tricks; biting, and kicking, and
plunging, as if the devil was in thy
body; and now thou couldst run a∣way
with a thief, and leave me to be
flea'd alive by master: what canst
thou say for thyself, thou cruel, hard∣hearted,
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
unchristian tuoad!” To this
tender expostulation, which afforded
much entertainment to the boys, Gil∣bert
answered not one word; but
seemed altogether insensible to the
caresses of Timothy, who forthwith
led him into the stable. On the
whole, he seems to have been an un∣social
animal: for it does not appear
that he ever contracted any degree of
intimacy, even with Bronzomarte, du∣ring
the whole course of their ac∣quaintance
and fellowship. On the
contrary, he has been more than once
known to signify his aversion by
throwing out behind, and other erup∣tive
marks of contempt for that ele∣gant
charger, who excelled him as
much in personal merit, as his rider
Timothy was outshone by his all∣accomplished
master. While the
squire accommodated Gilbert in the
stable, the knight sent for the foot∣man
who had brought him back;
and, having presented him with a li∣beral
acknowledgment, desired to
<PB N="178" REF="183"/>
in what manner the horse had been
retrieved.</P>
<P>The stranger satisfied him in this
particular, by giving him to under∣stand,
that the highwayman, perceiv∣ing
himself pursued across the coun∣try,
plied Gilbert so severely with
whip and spur, that the animal re∣sented
the usage, and being besides,
perhaps, a little struck with remorse
for having left his old friend Crab∣shaw,
suddenly halted, and stood
stock still, notwithstanding all the
stripes and tortures he underwent; or
if he moved at all, it was in a re∣trograde
direction. The thief, see∣ing
all his endeavours ineffectual, and
himself in danger of being overtaken,
wisely quitted his acquisition, and fled
into the bosom of a neighbouring
wood.</P>
<P>Then the knight inquired about
the situation of the lady in the coach,
and offered himself as her guard and
conductor: but was told that she was
already safely lodged in the house of
<PB N="179" REF="184"/>
a gentleman at some distance from the
road. He likewise learned that she
was a person disordered in her senses,
under the care and tuition of a widow
lady her relation; and that in a day
or two they should pursue their jour∣ney
northward to the place of her
habitation. After the footman had
been some time dismissed, the knight
recollected that he had forgot to ask
the name of the person to whom he
belonged; and began to be uneasy at
this omission, which indeed was more
interesting than he could imagine:
for an explanation of this nature would
in all likelihood, have led to a disco∣very,
that the lady in the coach was
no other than Miss Aurelia Darnel,
who seeing him unexpectedly in such
an equipage and attitude, as he passed
the coach, (for his helmet was off)
had screamed with surprize and terror,
and fainted away. Nevertheless,
when she recovered from her swoon,
she concealed the real cause of her
agitation, and none of her attendants
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
were acquainted with the person of
Sir Launcelot.</P>
<P>The circumstances of the disorder,
under which she was said to labour,
shall be revealed in due course. In
the mean time, our adventurer, though
unaccountably affected, never dreamed
of such an occurrence; but being
very much fatigued, resolved to in∣demnify
himself for the loss of last
night's repose; and this happened to
be one of the few things in which
Crabshaw felt an ambition to follow
his master's example.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which may serve to shew, that true pa∣triotism
is of no party.</HEAD>
<P>THE knight had not enjoyed his
repose above two hours, when
he was disturbed by such a variety of
noises, as might have discomposed a
brain of the firmest texture. The
rumbling of carriages, and the rattling
of horses feet on the pavement, was
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
intermingled with loud shouts, and
the noise of fiddle, french-horn, and
bagpipe. A loud peal was heard
ringing in the church-tower, at some
distance, while the inn refounded with
clamour, confusion, and uproar.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot being thus alarmed,
started from his bed, and running to
the window, beheld a cavalcade of
persons well mounted, and distin∣guished
by blue cockades. They
were generally attired like jockies,
with gold-laced hats and buckskin
breeches, and one of them bore a
standard of blue silk, inscribed in
white letters, LIBERTY AND THE
LANDED INTEREST. He who rode
at their head was a jolly figure, of a
florid complexion and round belly,
seemingly turned of fifty, and, in all
appearance, of a choleric disposition.
As they approached the market-place
they waved their hats, huzza'd, and
cried aloud, No FOREIGN CONNEC∣TIONS,—OLD-ENGLAND
FOR EVER.
This acclamation, however, was not
so loud or universal, but that our ad∣venturer
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
could distinctly hear a coun∣ter-cry
from the populace, of NO
SLAVERY,—NO POPISH PRETENDER.
An insinuation so ill relished by the
cavaliers, that they began to ply their
horsewhips among the multitude, and
were, in their turn, saluted with a
discharge or volley of stones, dirt, and
dead cats; in consequence of which
some teeth were demolished, and ma∣ny
surtouts defiled.</P>
<P>Our adventurer's attention was soon
called off from this scene, to contem∣plate
another procession of people on
foot, adorned with bunches of orange
ribbons, attended by a regular band of
musick, playing <HI>God save great George
our king,</HI> and headed by a thin, swar∣thy
personage, of a sallow aspect and
large goggling eyes, arched over with
two thick semicircles of hair, or ra∣ther
bristles, jet black, and frowzy.
His apparel was very gorgeous, though
his address was aukward; he was ac∣companied
by the mayor, recorder,
and heads of the corporation, in their
formalities. His ensigns were known
<PB N="183" REF="188"/>
by the inscription, <HI>Liberty of Con∣science
and the Protestant Succession;</HI>
and the people saluted him as he passed
with repeated cheers, that seemed to
prognosticate success. He had par∣ticularly
ingratiated himself with the
good women, who lined the street,
and sent forth many ejaculatory pe∣titions
in his favour.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot immediately compre∣hended
the meaning of this solemni∣ty:
he perceived it was the prelude
to the election of a member to repre∣sent
the county in parliament, and he
was seized with an eager desire to
know the names and characters of the
competitors. In order to gratify this
desire, he made repeated application
to the bell-rope that depended from
the cieling of his apartment; but this
produced nothing, except the repeti∣tion
of the words “Coming, Sir,”
which ecchoed from three or four dif∣ferent
corners of the house. The
waiters were so distracted by a variety
of calls, that they stood motionless,
in the state of the schoolman's ass be∣tween
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
two bundles of hay, incapable
of determining where they should first
offer their attendance.</P>
<P>Our knight's patience was almost
exhausted, when Crabshaw entered
the room, in a very strange equipage:
one half of his face appeared close
shaved, and the other covered with
lather, while the blood trickled in
two rivulets from his nose, upon a
barber's cloth that was tucked under
his chin; he looked grim with indig∣nation,
and under his left arm car∣ried
his cutlass, unsheathed. Where
he had acquired so much of the pro∣fession
of knight-errantry we shall not
pretend to determine; but, certain it
is, he fell on his knees before Sir
Launcelot, crying, with an accent of
rage and distraction, “In the name of
St. George for England, I beg a boon,
Sir knight, and thy compliance I de∣mand,
before the peacock and the
ladies.”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, astonished at this
address, replied in a lofty strain, “Va∣liant
squire, thy boon is granted, pro∣vided
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
it doth not contravene the laws
of the land, and the constitutions of
chivalry.” “Then I crave leave (an∣swered
Crabshaw) to challenge and
defy to mortal combat, that caitif
barber who hath left me in this piteous
condition; and I vow by the peacock,
that I will not shave my beard, until
I have shaved his head from his shoul∣ders:
so may I thrive in the occupa∣tion
of an arrant squire.”</P>
<P>Before his master had time to en∣quire
into particulars, they were join∣ed
by a decent man in boots, who
was likewise a traveller, and had seen
the rise and progress of Timothy's
disaster. He gave the knight to un∣sterstand,
that Crabshaw had sent for
a barber, and already undergone one
half of the operation, when the ope∣rator
received the long expected mes∣sage
from both the gentlemen, who
stood candidates at the election. The
double summons was no sooner inti∣mated
to him, than he threw down
his bason and retired with precipita∣tion,
leaving the squire in the suds.
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
Timothy, incensed at this desertion,
followed him with equal celerity into
the street, where he collared the sha∣ver,
and insisted upon being entirely
trimmed, on pain of the bastinado.
The other finding himself thus arrest∣ed,
and having no time to spare for
altercation, lifted up his fist, and dis∣charged
it upon the snout of Crab∣shaw
with such force, that the un∣fortunate
aggressor was fain to bite
the ground, while the victor hastened
away, in hope of touching the dou∣ble
wages of corruption.</P>
<P>The knight being informed of these
circumstances, told Timothy with a
smile, that he should have liberty to
defy the barber, but in the mean
time, he ordered him to saddle Bron∣zomarte,
and prepare for immediate
service. While the squire was thus
employed, his master engaged in
conversation with the stranger, who
happened to be a London dealer tra∣velling
for orders, and was well ac∣quainted
with the particulars which
our adventurer wanted to know. It
<PB N="187" REF="192"/>
was from this communicative trades∣man
he learned, that the competitors
were Sir Valentine Quickset and Mr.
Isaac Vanderpelft; the first a mere
fox-hunter, who depended for success
in this election upon his interest a∣mong
the high-flying gentry; the o∣ther
a stock-jobber and contractor, of
foreign extract, not without a mixture
of Hebrew blood, immensely rich,
who was countenanced by his grace
of—, and supposed to have di∣stributed
large sums in securing a ma∣jority
of votes among the yeomanry
of the county, possessed of small free∣holds,
and copyholders, a great num∣ber
of which last resided in this bur∣rough.
He said these were generally
dissenters and weavers; and that the
mayor, who was himself a manufac∣turer,
had received a very consider∣able
order for exportation, in conse∣quence
of which, it was believed, he
would support Mr. Vanderpelft with
all his influence and credit.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, rouzed at this in∣telligence,
called for his armour,
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>
which being buckled on in a hurry,
he mounted his steed, attended by
Crabshaw on Gilbert, and rode im∣mediately
into the midst of the mul∣titude
by which the hustings were
surrounded, just as Sir Valentine
Quicket began to harangue the peo∣ple
from an occasional theatre, form∣ed
of a plank supported by the upper
board of the publick stocks, and an
inferior rib of a wooden cage pitched
also for the accommodation of petty
delinquents.</P>
<P>Though the singular appearance of
Sir Launcelot at first attracted the eyes
of all the spectators, yet they did not
fail to yield attention to the speech of
his brother knight, Sir Valentine,
which ran in the following strain:
Gentlemen vreehoulders of this
here county, I shan't pretend to meake
a vine vlourishing speech,—I'm a plain
spoken man, as you all know. I
hope I shall always speak my maind
without vear or vavour, as the zaying
is. 'Tis the way of the Quicksets—we
are no upstarts, nor vorreigners,
<PB N="189" REF="194"/>
nor have we any Jewish blood in our
veins;—we have lived in this here
neighbourhood time out of maind, as
you all know; and possess an estate
of vive thousand clear, which we
spend at whoam, among you, in old
English hospitality—All my voreva∣thers
have been parliament-men, and
I can prove that ne'er a one o'um
gave a zingle vote for the court since
the revolution. Vor my own peart,
I value not the ministry three skips of
a louse, as the zaying is,—I ne'er
knew but one minister that was an
honest man; and vor all the rest I care
not if they were hanged as high as
Haman, with a pox to'un—I am,
thank God, a vree-born, true-hearted
Englishman, and a loyal, thof un∣worthy,
son of the church—vor all
they have done vor H—r, I'd vain
know what they have done vor the
church, with a vengeance—vor my
own peart, I hate all vorreigners, and
vorreign measures, whereby this poor
nation is broken-backed with a dismal
load of debt, and taxes rise so high
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>
that the poor cannot get bread. Gen∣tlemen
vreehoulders of this county,
I value no minister a vig's end, d'ye
see; if you will vavour me with your
votes and interest, whereby I may
be returned, I'll engage one half of
my estate that I never cry yea to vour
shillings in the pound; but will cross
the ministry in every thing, as in duty
bound, and as becomes an honest
vreeholder in the ould interest—but,
if you sell your votes and your coun∣try
for hire, you will be detested in
this here world, and damned in the
next to all eternity: so I leave every
man to his own conscience.”</P>
<P>This eloquent oration was received
by his own friends with loud peals of
applause; which, however, did not dis∣courage
his competitor, who, confident
of his own strength, ascended the
rostrum, or, in other words, an old
cask, set upright for the purpose.
Having bowed all round to the au∣dience,
with a smile of gentle con∣descension,
he told them, how am∣bitious
he was of the honour to re∣present
<PB N="191" REF="196"/>
this county in parliament;
and how happy he found himself in
the encouragement of his friends, who
had so unanimously agreed to support
his pretensions. He said, over and
above the qualification he possessed a∣mong
them, he had fourscore thou∣sand
pounds in his pocket, which he
had acquired by commerce, the sup∣port
of the nation, under the present
happy establishment, in defence of
which he was ready to spend the last
farthing. He owned himself a faith∣ful
subject to his majesty king George,
sincerely attached to the protestant
succession, in detestation and defiance
of a popish, an abjured, and out∣lawed
pretender; and declared that
he would exhaust his substance and
his blood, if necessary, in maintain∣ing
the principles of the glorious re∣volution.
“This (cried he) is the
solid basis and foundation upon which
I stand.”</P>
<P>These last words had scarce pro∣ceeded
from his mouth, when the
head of the barrel or puncheon on
<PB N="192" REF="197"/>
which he stood, being frail and in∣firm,
gave way; so that down he
went with a crash, and in a twinkling
disappeared from the eyes of the asto∣nished
beholders. The fox-hunters
perceiving his disaster, exclaimed, in
the phrase and accent of the chace,
“Stole away! stole away!” and, with
hideous vociferation, joined in the syl∣van
chorus which the hunters hollow
when the hounds are at fault.</P>
<P>The disaster of Mr. Vanderpelft
was soon repaired by the assiduity of
his friends, who disengaged him from
the barrel in a trice, hoisted him on
the shoulders of four strong weavers,
and resenting the unmannerly exulta∣tion
of their antagonists, began to
form themselves in order of battle.
An obstinate fray would have un∣doubtedly
ensued, had not their mu∣tual
indignation given way to their
curiosity, at the motion of our knight,
who had advanced into the middle
between the two fronts, and waving
his hand, as a signal for them to give
attention, addressed himself to them
<PB N="193" REF="198"/>
with graceful demeanor, in these
words: “Countrymen, friends, and
fellow-citizens, you are this day assem∣bled
to determine a point of the ut∣most
consequence to yourselves and
your posterity; a point that ought to
be determined by far other weapons
than brutal force and factious clamour.
You, the freemen of England, are
the basis of that excellent constitution,
which hath long flourished the object
of envy and admiration. To you be∣longs
the inestimable privilege of
choosing a delegate properly qualified
to represent you in the high court of
parliament. This is your birth-right,
inherited from your ancestors, obtain∣ed
by their courage, and sealed with
their blood. It is not only your birth∣right,
which you should maintain in
defiance of all danger, but also a sa∣cred
trust, to be executed with the
most scrupulous care and fidelity.
The person whom you trust ought
not only to be endued with the most
inflexible integrity, but should like-wise
possess a fund of knowledge that
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>
may enable him to act as a part of
the legislature. He must be well ac∣quainted
with the history, the con∣stitution,
and the laws of his coun∣try:
he must understand the forms of
business, the extent of the royal pre∣rogative,
the privilege of parliament,
the detail of government, the nature
and regulation of the finances, the
different branches of commerce, the
politicks that prevail, and the con∣nections
that subsist among the dif∣ferent
powers of Europe: for, on all
these subjects, the deliberations of a
house of commons occasionally turn:
but these great purposes will never be
answered by electing an illiterate sa∣vage,
scarce qualified, in point of un∣derstanding,
to act as a country justice
of the peace, a man who has scarce
ever travelled beyond the excursion of
a fox-chace, whose conversation never
rambles farther than his stable, his
kennel, and his barn-yard; who re∣jects
decorum as degeneracy, mistakes
rusticity for independence, ascertains
his courage by leaping over gates and
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
ditches, and founds his triumph on feats
of drinking; who holds his estate by a
factious tenure, professes himself the
blind slave of a party, without know∣ing
the principles that gave it birth,
or the motives by which it is actuated,
and thinks that all patriotism consists
in railing indiscriminately at ministers,
and obstinately opposing every mea∣sure
of the administration. Such a
man, with no evil intentions of his
own, might be used as a dangerous
tool in the hands of desperate faction,
by scattering the seeds of disaffection,
embarrassing the wheels of govern∣ment,
and reducing the whole king∣dom
to anarchy.”</P>
<P>Here the knight was interrupted
by the shouts and acclamations of
the Vanderpelfites, who cried aloud,
“Hear him! hear him! long life
to the iron-cased orator.” This cla∣mour
subsiding, he prosecuted his ha∣rangue
to the following effect:</P>
<P>“Such a man as I have described
may be dangerous from ignorance,
but is neither so mischievous nor so
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
detestable as the wretch who know∣ingly
betrays his trust, and sues to be
the hireling and prostitute of a weak
and worthless minister; a sordid
knave, without honour or principle,
who belongs to no family whose ex∣ample
can reproach him with degene∣racy;
who has no country to com∣mand
his respect, no friends to en∣gage
his affection, no religion to re∣gulate
his morals, no conscience to
restrain his iniquity, and who worships
no God but mammon. An insinuat∣ing
miscreant, who undertakes for the
dirtiest work of the vilest administra∣tion;
who practises national usury,
receiving by wholesale the rewards
venality, and distributing the wages
of corruption by retail.”</P>
<P>In this place our adventurer's speech
was drowned in the acclamations of
of the fox-hunters, who now trium∣phed
in their turn, and hoicksed the
speaker, exclaiming, “Well opened
Jowler—to 'un, to 'un, to 'un again,
Sweetlips! hey, Merry, Whitefoot!”
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
After a short interruption, he thus re∣sumed
his discourse:</P>
<P>“When such a caitif presents him∣self
to you, like the devil, with a
temptation in his hand, avoid him
as if he were in fact the devil—it is not
the offering of disinterested love; for
what should induce him, who has no
affections, to love you, to whose per∣sons
he is an utter stranger? alas! it
is not a benevolence, but a bribe. He
wants to buy you at one market, that
he may sell you at another. With∣out
doubt his intention is to make an
advantage of his purchase; and this
aim he cannot accomplish, but by sa∣crificing,
in some sort, your interest,
your independency, to the wicked de∣signs
of a minister, as he can expect
no gratification for the faithful dis∣charge
of his duty. But, even if he
should not find an opportunity of sell∣ing
you to advantage, the crime, the
shame, the infamy, will still be the
same in you, who, baser than the
most abandoned prostitutes, have sold
yourselves and your posterity for hire
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>
—for a paultry price, to be refunded
with interest by some minister, who
will indemnify himself cut of your
own pockets: for, after all, you are
bought and sold with your own mo∣ney—
the miserable pittance you may
now receive, is no more than a pitcher
full of water thrown in to moisten the
sucker of that pump which will drain
you to the bottom. Let me there∣fore
advise and exhort you, my coun∣trymen,
to avoid the opposite extremes
of the ignorant clown and the design∣ing
courtier, and choose a man of ho∣nesty,
intelligence, and moderation,
who will—”</P>
<P>The doctrine of moderation was a
very unpopular subject in such an as∣sembly;
and, accordingly, they re∣jected
it as one man. They began
to think the stranger wanted to set up
for himself, a supposition that could
not fail to incense both sides equally,
as they were both zealously engaged
in their respective causes. The Whigs
and the Tories joined against this in∣truder,
who being neither, was treated
<PB N="199" REF="204"/>
like a monster, or chimaera in politics.
They hissed, they hooted, and they
hollowed; they annoyed him with
missiles of dirt, sticks, and stones;
they cursed, they threatened, and re∣viled,
till at length his patience was
exhausted.</P>
<P>Ungrateful and abandoned mis∣creants!
(he cried) I spoke to you as
men and christians, as free-born Bri∣tons
and fellow-citizens: but I per∣ceive
you are a pack of venal, infa∣mous
scoundrels, and I will treat you
accordingly.” So saying, he brandish∣ed
his lance, and riding into the thick∣est
of the concourse, laid about him
with such dexterity and effect, that
the multitude was immediately dis∣persed,
and he retired without further
molestation.</P>
<P>The same good fortune did not at∣tend
squire Crabshaw in his retreat.
The ludicrous singularity of his fea∣tures,
and the half-mown crop of hair
that bristled from one side of his coun∣tenance,
invited some wags to make
merry at his expence: one of them
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
clapped a furze-bush under the tail of
Gilbert, who, feeling himself thus
stimulated <HI>a posteriori,</HI> kicked and
plunged and capered in such a man∣ner,
that Timothy could hardly keep
the saddle. In this commotion he
lost his cap and his periwig, while
the rabble pelted him in such a man∣ner,
that, before he could join his ma∣ster,
he looked like a pillar, or rather
a pillory, of mud.</P>

<P>SIR Launcelot, boiling with in∣dignation
at the venality and fac∣tion
of the electors, whom he had
harangued to so little purpose, retired
with the most deliberate disdain to∣wards
one of the gates of the town,
on the outside of which his curiosity
was attracted by a concourse of peo∣ple,
in the midst of whom stood Mr.
Ferret, mounted upon a stool, with a

kind of satchel hanging round his
neck, and a vial displayed in his right
hand, while he held forth to the au∣dience
in a very vehement strain of
elocution.</P>
<P>Crabshaw thought himself happi∣ly
delivered, when he reached the
suburbs, and proceeded without halt∣ing;
but his master mingled with the
crowd, and heard the orator express
himself to this effect: “Very likely,
you may undervalue me and my me∣dicine,
because I don't appear upon a
stage of rotten boards, in a shabby
velvet coat and tye-periwig, with a
foolish fellow in motley, to make

We have quacks in religion, quacks
in physic, quacks in law, quacks in
politics, quacks in patriotism, quacks
in government; high German quacks
that have blistered, sweated, bled, and
purged the nation into an atrophy.
But this is not all: they have not only
evacuated her into a consumption, but
they have intoxicated her brain, until
she is become delirious: she can no

indeed, rightly distinguish it: like the
people of Nineveh, she can hardly
tell her right hand from her left; but,

deserts, and will one day break her
neck over some barren rocks, or leave
her sticking in some H—n pit or quag∣mire.
For my part, if you have a
mind to betray your country, I have
no objection. In selling yourselves
and your fellow-citizens, you only
dispose of a pack of rascals who de∣serve
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
to be sold—If you sell one ano∣ther,
why should not I sell this here
Elixir of Long Life, which if properly
used, will protract your days till you
shall have seen your country ruined?
I shall not pretend to disturb your un∣derstandings,
which are none of the
strongest, with a hotch-potch of un∣intelligible
terms, such as Aristotle's
four principles of generation, unform∣ed
matter, privation, efficient and fi∣nal
causes. Aristotle was a pedantic
blockhead, and still more knave than
fool. The same censure we may safe∣ly
put on that wise-acre Dioscorides,
with his faculties of simples, his se∣minal,
specific, and principal virtues;
and that crazy commentator Galen,
with his four elements, elementary
qualities, his eight complexions, his
harmonies, and discords. Nor shall
I expatiate on the alkahest of that
mad scoundrel Paracelsus, with which
he pretended to reduce flints into salt;
nor the <HI>archaeus</HI> or <HI>spiritus rector</HI> of
that visionary Van Helmont, his simple,
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
elementary water, his <HI>gas,</HI> ferments,
and transmutations; nor shall I en∣large
upon the salt, sulphur, and oil,
the <HI>acidum vagum,</HI> the mercury of me∣tals,
and the volatilized vitriol of other
modern chymists, a pack of ignorant,
conceited, knavish rascals, that puzzle
your weak heads with such jargon,
just as a Germanized m—r throws
dust in your eyes, by lugging in and
ringing the changes on the balance of
power, the protestant religion, and your
allies on the continent; acting like the
juggler, who picks your pockets while
he dazzles your eyes and amuses your
fancy with twirling his fingers, and
reciting the gibberish of <HI>hocus pocus;</HI>
for, in fact, the balance of power is
a mere chimera; as for the protestant
rellgion, nobody gives himself any
trouble about it; and allies on the
continent we have none; or at least,
none that would raise an hundred men
to save us from perdition, unless we
paid an extravagant price for their
assistance. But, to return to this here
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
Elixir of Long Life, I might embel∣lish
it with a great many high-sound∣ing
epithets; but I disdain to follow
the example of every illiterate vaga∣bond,
that from idleness turns quack,
and advertises his nostrum in the pub∣lic
papers. I am neither a felonious
dry-salter returned from exile, an
hospital stump-turner, a decayed stay∣maker,
a bankrupt-printer, or insol∣vent
debtor, released by act of parlia∣ment.
I did not pretend to admini∣ster
medicines, without the least tinc∣ture
of letters, or suborn wretches to
perjure themselves in false affidavits of
cures that were never performed; nor
employ a set of led-captains to ha∣rangue
in my praise, at all public pla∣ces.
I was bred regularly to the pro∣fession
of chymistry, and have tried all
the processes of alchemy, and I may
venture to say, that this here Elixir
is, in fact, the <HI>chruseon pepuromenon ek
puros,</HI> the visible, glorious, spiritual
body, from whence all other beings
derive their existence, as proceeding
from their father the sun, and their
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
mother the moon; from the sun, as
from a living and spiritual gold, which
is mere fire; consequently, the com∣mon
and universal first created mover,
from whence all moveable things have
their distinct and particular motions;
and also from the moon, as from the
wife of the sun, and the common
mother of all sublunary things: and
for as much as man is, and must be
the comprehensive end of all crea∣tures,
and the microcosm, he is coun∣selled
in the Revelations to buy gold
that is thoroughly fired, or rather pure
fire, that he may become rich and
like the sun; as, on the contrary, he
becomes poor, when he abuses the
arsenical poison; so that his silver, by
the fire, must be calcined to a <HI>caput
mortuum,</HI> which happens, when he
will hold and retain the menstruum
out of which he partly exists, for his
own property, and doth not daily of∣fer
up the same in the fire of the sun,
that the woman may be cloathed with
the sun, and become a sun, and there∣by
rule over the moon; that is to say,
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
that he may get the moon under his
feet.—Now this here Elixir, sold for
no more than six-pence a vial, con∣tains
the essence of the alkahest, the
archaeus, the catholicon, the men∣struum,
the sun, moon, and to sum
up all in one word, is the true, ge∣nuine,
unadulterated, unchangeable,
immaculate and specific <HI>chruseon pepu∣romenon
ek puros.</HI>”</P>
<P>The audience were variously affect∣ed
by this learned oration: some of
those who favoured the pretensions of
the whig candidate, were of opinion
that he ought to be punished for his
presumption in reflecting so scurri∣lously
on ministers and measures. Of
this sentiment was our adventurer,
though he could not help admiring
the courage of the orator, and own∣ing
within himself, that he had mixed
some melancholy truths with his scur∣rility.
Mr. Ferret would not have
stood so long in his rostrum unmo∣lested,
had not he cunningly chosen
his station immediately without the
jurisdiction of the town, whose ma∣gistrates
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
therefore could not take cog∣nizance
of his conduct; but appli∣cation
was made to the constable of
the other parish, while our nostrum∣monger
proceeded in his speech, the
conclusion of which produced such
an effect upon his hearers, that his
whole cargo was immediately ex∣hausted.
He had just stepped down
from his stool, when the constable,
with his staff, arrived, and took him
under his guidance. Mr. Ferret, on
this occasion, attempted to interest the
people in his behalf, by exhorting them
to vindicate the liberty of the subject,
against such an act of oppression; but
finding them deaf to the tropes and
figures of his elocution, he addressed
himself to our knight, reminding him
of his duty to protect the helpless and
the injured, and earnestly soliciting his
interposition.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, without making the
least reply to his entreaties, resolved to
see the end of this adventure; and be∣ing
joined by his squire, followed the
prisoner at a distance, measuring back
<PB N="209" REF="214"/>
the ground he had travelled the day
before, until he reached another small
borough, where Ferret was housed in
the common prison. While he sat a∣horseback,
deliberating on the next
step he should take, he was accosted
by the voice of Tom Clarke, who
called in a whimpering tone, through
a window grated with iron, “For
the love of God! Sir Launcelot, do,
dear Sir, be so good as to take the
trouble to alight and come up stairs
—I have something to communicate
of consequence to the community in
general, and you in particular—Pray,
do, dear Sir Knight. I beg a boon
in the name of St. Michael and St.
George for England.”</P>
<P>Our adventurer, not a little sur∣prized
at this address, dismounted
without hesitation, and being admit∣ted
to the common jail, there found
not only his old friend Tom, but also
the uncle, sitting on a bench with a
woollen night-cap on his head, and a
pair of spectacles on his nose, reading
very earnestly in a book, which he
<PB N="210" REF="215"/>
afterwards understood was intituled,
“The Life and Adventures of Va∣lentine
and Orson.” The captain no
sooner saw his great pattern enter,
than he rose and received him with
the salutation of “What cheer, bro∣ther?”
and before the knight could
answer, added these words: “You
see how the land lies—here have Tom
and I been fast a-shore these four and
twenty hours; and this berth we have
got by attempting to tow your galley,
brother, from the enemy's harbour.—Adds
bobs! if we had this here fel∣low
whoreson for a consort, with all
our tackle in order, brother, we'd soon
shew'em the topsail, slip our cable,
and down with their barricadoes. But,
howsomever, it don't signify talking,
—patience is a good stream-anchor,
and will hold, as the saying is,
—but, damn my—as for the matter
of my boltsprit.——Hearkye, heark∣ye,
brother, damn'd hard to engage
with three at a time, one upon my
bow, one upon my quarter, and one
right a-head, rubbing, and drubbing,
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>
lying athwart hawse, raking fore and
aft, battering and grappling, and lash∣ing
and clashing—adds heart, brother;
crash went the boltsprit—down came
the round-top—up with the dead lights
—I saw nothing but the stars at noon,
lost the helm of my seven senses, and
down I broached upon my broadside.”—</P>
<P>As Mr. Clarke rightly conceived
that his uncle would need an interpre∣ter,
he began to explain these hints
by giving a circumstantial detail of his
own and the captain's disaster. He
told Sir Launcelot, that notwithstand∣ing
all his persuasion and remonstran∣ces,
captain Crowe insisted upon ap∣pearing
in the character of a knight-errant;
and with that view had set
out from the public-house on the
morning that succeeded his vigil in
the church: that upon the high-way
they had met with a coach, contain∣ing
two ladies, one of whom seem∣ed
to be under great agitation; for,
as they passed, she struggled with the
other, thrust out her head at the
window, and said something which
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
he could not distinctly hear; that cap∣tain
Crowe was struck with admiration
of her unequalled beauty; and he,
(Tom) no sooner informed him who
she was, than he resolved to set her
at liberty, on the supposition that she
was under restraint and in distress: that
he accordingly unsheathed his cutlass,
and riding back after the coach, com∣manded
the driver to bring to, on pain
of death: that one of the servants
believing the captain to be an high∣wayman,
presented a blunderbuss, and
in all probability would have shot him
on the spot, had not he (the nephew)
rode up and assured them the gentle∣man
was <HI>non compos:</HI> that notwith∣standing
his intimation, all the three
attacked him with the butt ends of
their horse-whips, while the coach
drove on, and although he laid about
him with great fury, at last brought
him to the ground by a stroke on the
temple: that Mr. Clarke himself then
interposed in defence of his kinsman,
and was also severely beaten: that two
of the servants, upon application to
<PB N="213" REF="218"/>
a justice of the peace, residing near
the field of battle, had granted a
warrant against the captain and his
nephew, and without examination,
committed them as idle vagrants, af∣ter
having seized their horses and their
money, on pretence of their being
suspected for highwaymen. “But,
as there was no just cause of suspicion,
(added he) I am of opinion, the ju∣stice
is guilty of a trespass, and may
be sued for <HI>falsum imprisonamentum,</HI>
and considerable damages obtained;
for you will please to observe, Sir,
no justice has a right to commit any
person 'till after due examination; be∣sides,
we were not committed for an
assault and battery, <HI>auditâ querela,</HI> nor
as wandering lunatics by the statute,
who, to be sure, may be apprehend∣ed
by a justice's warrant, and locked
up and chained, if necessary, or to
be sent to their last legal settlement:
but we were committed as vagrants
and suspected highwaymen. Now
we do not fall under the descrip∣tion
of vagrants; nor did any circum∣stance
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>
appear to support the suspicion
of robbery; for to constitute robbery,
there must be something taken; but
here nothing was taken but blows,
and they were upon compulsion: even
an attempt to rob, without any taking,
is not felony, but a misdemeanor.
To be sure there is a taking in deed,
and a taking in law: but still the rob∣ber
must be in possession of a thing
stolen; and we attempted to steal
ourselves away——My uncle indeed
would have released the young lady
<HI>vi et armis,</HI> had his strength been e∣qual
to his inclination; and in so do∣ing,
I would have willingly lent my
assistance, both from a desire to serve
such a beautiful young creature, and
also in regard to your honour, for I
thought I heard her call upon your
name.”—</P>
<P>“Ha! how! what! whose name?
say, speak—heaven and earth!” (cried
the Knight, with marks of the most
violent emotion.) Clarke terrified at
his looks, replied, “I beg your par∣don
a thousand times; I did not say
<PB N="215" REF="220"/>
positively she did speak those words:
but I apprehended she did speak
them. Words, which may be taken
or interpreted by a law in general,
or common sense, ought not to re∣ceive
a strained, or unusual construc∣tion;
and ambiguous words”——“Speak,
or be dumb for ever! (ex∣claimed
Sir Launcelot in a terrific
tone, laying, his hand on his sword)
what young lady, ha! What name
did she call upon?” Clarke falling on
his knees, answered, not without stam∣mering,
“Miss Aurelia Darnel; to
the best of my recollection, she cal∣led
upon Sir Launcelot Greaves.”
“Sacred powers! (cried our adven∣turer)
which way did the carriage pro∣ceed?”</P>
<P>When Tom told him that the coach
quitted the post-road, and struck a∣way
to the right at full speed, Sir
Launcelot was seized with a pensive
fit; his head sunk upon his breast,
and he mused in silence for several
minutes, with the most melancholy
expression on his countenance: then
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
recollecting himself, he assumed a
more composed and chearful air, and
asked several questions with respect
to the arms on the coach, and the li∣veries
worn by the servants. It was
in the course of this interrogation, that
he discovered he had actually con∣versed
with one of the foot-men,
who had brought back Crabshaw's
horse: a circumstance that filled him
with anxiety and chagrin, as he had
omitted to inquire the name of his
master, and the place to which the
coach was travelling; though, in all
probability, had he made these inqui∣ries,
he would have received very
little satisfaction, there being reason
to think the servants were enjoined
secrecy. The knight, in order to
meditate on this unexpected adven∣ture,
sat down by his old friend, and
entered into a reverie, which lasted
about a quarter of an hour, and might
have continued longer, had it not
been interrupted by the voice of Crab∣shaw,
who bawled aloud, “Look
to it, my masters—as you brew you
<PB N="217" REF="222"/>
must drink—this shall be a dear day's
work to some of you, for my part I
say nothing—the braying ass eats a
little grass—one barber shaves not so
close, but another finds a few stub∣ble——you
wanted to catch a capon,
and you've stole a cat. He that takes
up his lodgings in a stable, must be
contented to lie upon litter.—”</P>
<P>The knight, desirous of knowing
the cause that prompted Timothy to
apothegmatize in this manner, looked
through the grate, and perceived the
squire fairly set in the stocks, sur∣rounded
by a mob of people. When
he called to him, and asked the rea∣son
of this disgraceful restraint, Crab∣shaw
replied, “There's no cake, but
there's another of the same make—
who never climbed never fell—after
clouds comes clear weather. 'Tis all
long of your honour I've met with
this preferment; no deservings of my
own, but the interest of my master.
Sir knight, if you will flay the justice,
hang the constable, release your squire,
and burn the town, your name will
<PB N="218" REF="223"/>
be famous in story: but, if you are
content, I am thankful. Two hours
are soon spent in such good company;
in the mean time look to'un jailor,
there's a frog in the stocks.”</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, incensed at this af∣front
offered to his servant, advanced
to the prison-door, but found it fast
locked, and when he called to the
turnkey, he was given to understand
that he himself was prisoner. En∣raged
at this intimation, he demand∣ed
at whose suit; and was answered
through the wicket, “At the suit of
the king, in whose name I will hold
you fast, with God's assistance.”</P>
<P>The knight's looks now began to
lighten, he rolled his eyes around,
and snatching up an oaken bench,
which three ordinary men could scarce
have lifted from the ground, he, in
all likelihood, would have shattered
the door in pieces, had not he been
restrained by the interposition of Mr.
Clarke, who intreated him to have a
little patience, assuring him he would
suggest a plan that would avenge him
<PB N="219" REF="224"/>
amply on the justice, without any
breach of the peace. “I say, the
justice (added Tom) because it must
be his doing.—He is a little petulant
sort of a fellow, ignorant of the law,
guilty of numberless irregularities;
and, if properly managed, may for
this here act of arbitrary power, be
not only cast in a swinging sum, but
even turned out of the commission
with disgrace.—”</P>
<P>This was a very seasonable hint,
in consequence of which the bench
was softly replaced, and captain Crowe
deposited the poker, with which he
had armed himself to second the ef∣forts
of Sir Launcelot. They now,
for the first time, perceived that Fer∣ret
had disappeared; and, upon in∣quiry,
found that he was in fact the
occasion of the knight's detention and
the squire's disgrace.</P>

<PB N="220" REF="225"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Description of a modern Magistrate.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore the knight would take any
resolution for extricating himself
from his present embarrassment, he
desired to be better acquainted with the
character and circumstances of the
justice by whom he had been confined,
and likewise to understand the mean∣ing
of his own detention. To be in∣formed
in this last particular, he re∣newed
his dialogue with the turnkey,
who told him, through the grate, that
Ferret no sooner perceived him in the
jail, without his offensive arms, which
he had left below, than he desired to
be carried before the justice, where
he had given information against the
knight, as a violator of the public
peace, who strolled about the coun∣try
with unlawful arms, rendering
the highways unsafe, encroaching up∣on
the freedom of elections, putting
his majesty's liege subjects in fear of
their lives, and, in all probability,
<PB N="221" REF="226"/>
harbouring more dangerous designs
under an affected cloak of lunacy.
Ferret, upon this information, had
been released, and entertained as an
evidence for the king; and Crab∣shaw
was put in the stocks, as an idle
stroller.</P>
<P>Sir Launcelot, being satisfied in
these particulars, addressed himself to
his fellow-prisoners, and begged they
would communicate what they knew
respecting the worthy magistrate, who
had been so premature in the execu∣tion
of his office. This request was
no sooner signified than a crew of
naked wretches crowded around him,
and, like a congregation of rooks,
opened their throats all at once, in
accusation of justice Gobble. The
knight was moved at this scene, which
he could not help comparing, in his
own mind, to what would appear
upon a much more awful occasion,
when the cries of the widow and the
orphan, the injured and oppressed,
would be uttered at the tribunal of an
unerring Judge against the villainous
<PB N="222" REF="227"/>
and insolent authors of their calami∣ty.</P>
<P>When he had, with some difficul∣ty,
quieted their clamours, and con∣fined
his interrogation to one person
of a tolerably decent appearance, he
learned that justice Gobble, whose
father was a taylor, had for some
time served as a journeyman hosier in
London, where he had picked up
some law-terms, by conversing with
hackney-writers and attorneys clerks
of the lowest order; that, upon the
death of his master, he had insinuat∣ed
himself into the good graces of
the widow, who took him for her
husband, so that he became a person
of some consideration, and saved mo∣ney
apace; that his pride, increasing
with his substance, was reinforced by
the vanity of his wife, who persuaded
him to retire from business, that they
might live genteelly in the country;
that his father dying, and leaving a
couple of houses in this town, Mr.
Gobble had come down with his la∣dy
to take possession, and liked the
<PB N="223" REF="228"/>
place so well as to make a more con∣siderable
purchase in the neighbour∣hood;
that a certain peer being in∣debted
to him in the large way of his
business, and either unwilling or un∣able
to pay the money, had com∣pounded
the debt, by inserting his
name in the commission; since which
period his own insolence, and his
wife's ostentation, had exceeded all
bounds: that, in the exertion of his
authority, he had committed a thou∣sand
acts of cruelty and injustice
against the poorer sort of people, who
were unable to call him to a proper
account: that his wife domineered
with a more ridiculous, though less
pernicious usurpation, among the fe∣males
of the place: that, in a word,
she was the subject of continual mirth,
and he the object of universal detes∣tation.
Our adventurer, though ex∣tremely
well disposed to believe what
was said to the prejudice of Gobble,
would not give intire credit to this
description, without first inquir∣ing
into the particulars of his con∣duct.
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
He therefore asked the speak∣er,
what was the cause of his par∣ticular
complaint. “For my own
part, Sir, (said he) I lived in repute,
and kept a shop in this here town,
well furnished with a great variety of
articles. All the people in the place
were my customers; but what I and
many others chiefly depended upon,
was the extraordinary sale at two an∣nual
customary fairs, to which all
the country people in the neighbour∣hood
resorted to lay out their money.
I had employed all my stock, and
even engaged my credit to procure a
large assortment of goods for the
Lammas-market: but having given
my vote, in the election of a vestry∣clerk,
contrary to the interest of justice
Gobble, he resolved to work my
ruin. He suppressed the annual fairs,
by which a great many people, espe∣cially
publicans, earned the best part
of their subsistence. The country
people resorted to another town. I
was overstocked with a load of pe∣rishable
commodities; and found my∣self
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
deprived of the best part of my
home customers by the ill-nature and
revenge of the justice, who employ∣ed
all his influence among the com∣mon
people, making use of threats
and promises, to make them desert
my shop, and give their custom to
another person, whom he settled in
the same business under my nose.
Being thus disabled from making
punctual payments, my commodi∣ties
spoiling, and my wife breaking
her heart, I grew negligent and care∣less,
took to drinking, and my af∣fairs
went to wreck. Being one day
in liquor, and provoked by the fleers
and taunts of the man who had set
up against me, I struck him at his
own door; upon which I was carried
before the justice, who treated me
with such insolence, that I became
desperate, and not only abused him
in the execution of his office, but al∣so
made an attempt to lay violent
hands upon his person. You know,
Sir, when a man is both drunk and
desperate, he cannot be supposed to
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
have any command of himself. I
was sent hither to jail. My creditors
immediately seized my effects; and,
as they were not sufficient to discharge
my debts, a statute of bankruptcy
was taken out against me: so that
here I must lie, until they think pro∣per
to sign my certificate, or the par∣liament
shall please to pass an act for
the relief of insolvent debtors.”</P>
<P>The next person who presented
himself in the croud of accusers was
a meagre figure, with a green apron,
who told the knight that he had kept
a public house in town for a dozen
years, and enjoyed a good trade, which
was in a great measure owing to a
skittle-ground, in which the best peo∣ple
of the place diverted themselves
occasionally: that justice Gobble, be∣ing
disobliged at his refusing to part
with a gelding which he had bred for
his own use, first of all shut up the
skittle-ground; but finding the pub∣lican
still kept his house open, he
took care that he should be deprived
of his licence, on pretence that the
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
number of ale-houses was too great,
and that this man had been bred to
another employment. The poor pub∣lican,
being thus deprived of his bread,
was obliged to try the stay-making
business, to which he had served an
apprenticeship: but being very ill∣qualified
for this profession, he soon
fell to decay, and contracted debts,
in consequence of which he was now
in prison, where he had no other
support but what arose from the la∣bour
of his wife, who had gone to
service.</P>
<P>The next prisoner who preferred
his complaint against the unrighte∣ous
judge was a poacher, at whose
practices justice Gobble had for some
years connived, so as even to screen
him from punishment, in considera∣tion
of being supplied with game
gratis, till at length he was disap∣pointed
by accident. His lady had
invited guests to an entertainment,
and bespoke a hare, which the poa∣cher
undertook to furnish. He laid
his snares accordingly over night; but
<PB N="228" REF="233"/>
they were discovered, and taken away
by the game-keeper of the gentle∣man
to whom the ground belonged.
All the excuses the poacher could
make proved ineffectual in appeasing
the resentment of the justice and his
wise, at being thus disconcerted. Mea∣sures
were taken to detect the delin∣quent
in the exercise of his illicit occu∣pation:
he was committed to safe custo∣dy;
and his wife, with five bantlings,
was passed to her husband's settlement
in a different part of the country.</P>
<P>A stout squat fellow, rattling with
chains, had just taken up the ball of
accusation, when Sir Launcelot was
startled with the appearance of a wo∣man,
whose looks and equipage in∣dicated
the most piteous distress. She
seemed to be turned of the middle
age, was of a lofty carriage, tall,
thin, weather-beaten, and wretched∣ly
attired: her eyes were inflamed
with weeping, and her looks displayed
that wildness and peculiarity which
denote distraction. Advancing to Sir
Launcelot, she fell upon her knees,
<PB N="229" REF="234"/>
and clasping her hands together, utter∣ed
the following rhapsody in the most
vehement tone of affliction:</P>
<P>“Thrice potent, generous, and
august emperor, here let my knees
cleave to the earth, until thou shalt
do me justice on that inhuman cai∣tiff
Gobble. Let him disgorge my
substance which he hath devoured:
let him restore to my widowed arms
my child, my boy, the delight of my
eyes, the prop of my life, the staff
of my sustenance, whom he hath
torn from my embrace, stolen, be∣trayed,
sent into captivity, and mur∣dered!—
Behold these bleeding wounds
upon his lovely breast! see how they
mangle his lifeless coarse! Horrour!
give me my child, barbarians! his
head shall lie upon his Suky's bosom
—she will embalm him with her
tears.—Ha! plunge him in the deep!
shall my boy then float in a watry
tomb!—Justice, most mighty em∣peror!
justice upon the villain who
hath ruined us all!—May heaven's
dreadful vengeance overtake him!
<PB N="230" REF="235"/>
may the keen storm of adversity strip
him of all his leaves and fruit! may
peace forsake his mind, and rest be
banished from his pillow, so that all
his days shall be filled with reproach
and sorrow; and all his nights be
haunted with horrour and remorse!
may he be stung by jealousy without
cause, and maddened by revenge
without the means of execution!
may all his offspring be blighted and
consumed, like the mildewed ears of
corn, except one that shall grow up
to curse his old age, and bring his
hoary head with sorrow to the grave,
as he himself has proved a curse to
me and mine!”</P>
<P>The rest of the prisoners, perceiv∣ing
the knight extremely shocked
at her misery and horrid imprecation,
removed her by force from his pre∣sence,
and conveyed her to another
room; while our adventurer under∣went
a violent agitation, and could
not for some minutes compose him∣self
so well as to inquire into the na∣ture
of this wretched creature's cala∣mity.
<PB N="231" REF="236"/>
The shopkeeper, of whom he
demanded this satisfaction, gave him
to understand that she was born a
gentlewoman, and had been well
educated: that she married a curate,
who did not long survive his nuptials;
and afterwards became the wife of
one Oakley, a farmer, in opulent cir∣cumstances:
that, after twenty years
cohabitation with her husband, he
sustained such losses by the distemper
among the cattle, as he could not re∣pair;
and that this reverse of fortune
was supposed to have hastened his
death: that the widow, being a wo∣man
of spirit, determined to keep up
and manage the farm, with the assist∣ance
of an only son, a very promising
youth, who was already contracted in
marriage with the daughter of ano∣ther
wealthy farmer. Thus the mo∣ther
had a prospect of retrieving the
affairs of her family, when all her
hopes were dashed and destroyed by
a ridiculous pique which Mrs. Gob∣ble
conceived against the young far∣mer's
sweet-heart, Mrs. Susan Sedge∣moor.
<PB N="232" REF="237"/>
This young woman chancing
to be at a country assembly, where
the grave-digger of the parish acted
as master of the ceremonies, was cal∣led
out to dance before Miss Gobble,
who happened to be there present also
with her mother. The circumstance
was construed into an unpardonable
affront by the justice's lady, who a∣bused
the director, in the most op∣probrious
terms, for his insolence and
ill-manners; and, retiring in a storm
of passion, vowed revenge against the
saucy minx who had presumed to vie.
in gentility with Miss Gobble. The
justice entered into her resentment.
The grave-digger lost his place; and
Suky's lover, young Oakley, was
pressed for a soldier. Before his mo∣ther
could take any steps for his dis∣charge,
he was hurried away to the
East-Indies, by the industry and con∣trivance
of the justice.” Poor Suky
wept and pined until she fell into a
consumption. The forlorn widow,
being thus deprived of her son, was
overwhelmed with grief to such a
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
degree, that she could no longer ma∣nage
her concerns. Every thing
went backward: she ran in arrears
with her landlord, and the prospect
of bankruptcy aggravated her afflic∣tion,
while it added to her incapacity.
In the midst of these diastrous circum∣stances,
news arrived that her son
Greaves had lost his life in a sea-en∣gagement
with the enemy; and these
tidings almost instantly deprived her
of her reason. Then the landlord
seized for his rent; and she was ar∣rested
at the suit of justice Gobble,
who had bought up one of her debts,
in order to distress her, and now pre∣tended
that her madness was feigned.</P>
<P>When the name of Greaves was
mentioned our adventurer started,
and changed colour; and, now the
story was ended, asked, with marks
of eager emotion, if the name of the
woman's first husband was not Wil∣ford.
When the prisoner answered
in the affirmative, he rose up, and
striking his breast, “Good heaven!
(cried he) the very woman who watch∣ed
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
over my infancy, and even nou∣rished
me with her milk!—She was
my mother's humble friend.—Alas!
poor Dorothy! how would your old
mistress grieve to see her favourite in
this miserable condition!” While he
pronounced these words, to the asto∣nishment
of the hearers, a tear stole
softly down each cheek. Then he
desired to know if the poor lunatic
had any intervals of reason; and was
given to understand, that she was al∣ways
quiet, and generally supposed
to have the use of her senses, except
when she was disturbed by some ex∣traordinary
noise, or when any per∣son
touched upon her misfortune, or
mentioned the name of her oppressor,
in all which cases she started out into
extravagance and frenzy. They like∣wise
imputed great part of the disor∣der
to the want of quiet, proper food,
and necessaries, with which she was
but poorly supplied by the cold hand
of chance charity. Our adventurer
was exceedingly affected by the di∣stress
of this woman, whom he re∣solved
<PB N="235" REF="240"/>
to relieve; and in proportion
as his commiseration was excited, his
resentment rose against the miscreant,
who seemed to have infinuated him∣self
into the commission of the peace
on purpose to harrass and oppress his
fellow-creatures. Thus animated, he
entered into consultation with Mr.
Thomas Clarke concerning the steps
he should take, first for their deliver∣ance,
and then for prosecuting and
punishing the justice. In result of
this conference, the knight called
aloud for the jaylor, and demanded to
see a copy of his commitment, that
he might know the cause of his im∣prisonment,
and offer bail; or, in
case that should be refused, move for
a writ of Habeas Corpus. The jay∣lor
told him the copy of the writ
should be forthcoming; but after he
had waited some time, and repeated
the demand before witnesses, it was
not yet produced. Mr. Clarke then,
in a solemn tone, gave the jaylor to
understand, that an officer, refusing
to deliver a true copy of the commit∣ment
<PB N="236" REF="241"/>
warrant, was liable to the for∣feiture
of one hundred pounds for
the first offence; and for the second
to a forfeiture of twice that sum,
besides being disabled from executing
his office.</P>
<P>Indeed, it was no easy matter to
comply with Sir Launcelot's demand;
for no warrant had been granted, nor
was it now in the power of the justice
to remedy this defect, as Mr. Ferret had
taken himself away privately, with∣out
having communicated the name
and designation of the prisoner. A
circumstance the more mortifying to
the jaylor, as he perceived the extra∣ordinary
respect which Mr. Clarke
and the captain payed to the knight,
and was now fully convinced that he
would be dealt with according to law.
Disordered with these reflections, he
imparted them to the justice, who
had in vain caused search to be made
for Ferret, and was now extremely
well inclined to set the knight and his
friends at liberty, though he did not
at all suspect the quality and impor∣tance
<PB N="237" REF="242"/>
of our adventurer. He could
not, however, resist the temptation
of displaying the authority of his
office; and therefore ordered the pri∣soners
to be brought before his tribu∣nal,
that, in the capacity of a magi∣strate,
he might give them a severe
reproof, and proper caution, with re∣gard
to their future behaviour.</P>
<P>They were accordingly led thro' the
street in procession, guarded by the
constable and his gang, followed by
Crabshaw, who had by this time been
released from the stocks, and sur∣rounded
by a crowd of people, at∣tracted
by curiosity. When they ar∣rived
at the justice's house, they were
detained for some time in the passage:
then a voice was heard, commanding
the constable to bring in the prisoners,
and they were introduced to the hall
of audience, where Mr. Gobble sat in
judgment, with a crimson velvet
night-cap on his head; and on his
right hand appeared his lady, puffed
up with the pride and insolence of her
husband's office, fat, frowzy, and not
<PB N="238" REF="243"/>
over-clean, well stricken in years,
without the least vestige of an agree∣able
feature, having a rubicond nose,
ferret eyes, and imperious aspect. The
justice himself was a little, affected,
pert prig, who endeavoured to solem∣nize
his countenance by assuming an
air of consequence, in which pride,
impudence, and folly were strangely
blended. He aspired at nothing so
much as the character of an able
spokesman; and took all opportunities
of holding forth at vestry and quarter∣sessions,
as well as in the administra∣tion
of his office in private. He would
not, therefore, let slip this occasion of
exciting the admiration of his hearers,
and, in an authoritative tone, thus ad∣dressed
our adventurer:</P>
<P>“The laws of this land has pro∣vided—I
says, as how provision is
made by the laws of this here land,
in reverence to delinquems and mane∣factors,
whereby the king's peace is
upholden by we magistrates, who re∣presents
his majesty's person, better
than in e'er a contagious nation under
<PB N="239" REF="244"/>
the sun: but, howsoemever, that there
king's peace, and this here magistrate's
authority, cannot be adequably and
identically upheld, if so be as how
criminals escapes unpunished. Now,
friend, you must be confidentious in
your own mind, as you are a noto∣rious
criminal, who have trespassed a∣gain
the laws on divers occasions and
importunities; if I had a mind to ex∣ercise
the rigour of the law, according
to the authority wherewith I am wes∣ted,
you and your companions in ini∣quity
would be sewerely punished by
the statue: but we magistrates has a
power to litigate the sewerity of jus∣tice,
and so I am contented that you
shoulds be mercifully delt withal, and
even dismissed.”</P>
<P>To this harangue the knight re∣plied,
with solemn and deliberate ac∣cent,
“If I understand your meaning
aright, I am accused of being a notori∣ous
criminal; but nevertheless you are
contented to let me escape with im∣punity.
If I am a notorious criminal,
it is the duty of you, as a magistrate,
<PB N="240" REF="245"/>
to bring me to condign punishment;
and if you allow a criminal to escape
unpunished, you are not only unwor∣thy
of a place in the commission, but
become accessary to his guilt, and, to
all intents and purposes, <HI>socius criminis.</HI>
With respect to your proffered mercy,
I shall decline the favour; nor do I
deserve any indulgence at your hands:
for, depend upon it, I shall shew no
mercy to you, in the steps I intend to
take for bringing you to justice. I un∣derstand
that you have been long hack∣neyed
in the ways of oppression, and
I have seen some living monuments of
your inhumanity—of that hereafter.
I myself have been detained in prison,
without cause assigned. I have been
treated with indignity, and insulted
by jaylors and constables, led thro'
the streets like a felon, as a spectacle
to the multitude, obliged to dance
attendance in your passage, and after∣wards
branded with the name of no∣torious
criminal.—I now demand to
see the information in consequence of
which I was detained in prison, the
<PB N="241" REF="246"/>
copy of the warrant of commitment
or detainer, and the face of the per∣son
by whom I was accused. I insist
upon a compliance with these de∣mands,
as the privileges of a British
subject; and if it is refused, I shall
seek redress before a higher tribunal.”</P>
<P>The justice seemed to be not a lit∣tle
disturbed at this peremptory de∣claration;
which, however, had no
other effect upon his wife, but that of
enraging her choler, and inflaming her
countenance. “Sirrah! sirrah! (cried
she) do you dares to insult a worship∣ful
magistrate on the bench?—Can
you deny that you are a vagram, and
a dilatory sort of a person? Han't the
man with the satchel made an affidavy
of it?—If I was my husband, I'd
lay you fast by the heels for your re∣sumption,
and ferk you with a primi∣neery
into the bargain, unless you
could give a better account of your∣self—I
would.”</P>
<P>Gobble, encouraged by this fillip,
resumed his petulance, and proceed∣ed
in this manner:——“Heark ye,
friend, I might, as Mrs. Gobble very
<PB N="242" REF="247"/>
justly observes, trounce you for your
audacious behaviour; but I scorn to
take such advantages: howsomever,
I shall make you give an account of
yourself and your companions; for I
believes as how you are in a gang, and
all in a story, and perhaps you may
be found one day in a cord.—What
are you, friend? What is your station
and degree?” “I am a gentleman,”
replied the knight. “Ay, that is
English for a sorry fellow, (said the
justice.) Every idle vagabond, who
has neither home nor habitation, trade
nor profession, designs himself a gen∣tleman.
But I must know how you
live?” “Upon my means.” “What
are your means?”—“My estate.”—
“Whence doth it arise?” “From
inheritance.” “Your estate lies in
brass, and that you have inherited
from nature: but do you inherit lands
and tenements?” “Yes.” “But they
are neither here nor there, I doubt.—
Come, come, friend, I shall bring
you about presently.” Here the exami∣nation
was interrupted by the arrival of
Mr. Fillet the surgeon, who chancing to
<PB N="243" REF="248"/>
pass, and seeing a croud about the
door, went in to satisfy his curiosity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Which shews there are more ways to kill
a dog than hanging.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Fillet no sooner appeared in
the judgment-chamber of justice
Gobble than captain Crowe, seizing
him by the hand, exclaimed, “Body
o'me! Doctor, thou'rt come up in
the nick of time to lend us a hand in
putting about.—We're a little in the
stays here—but howsomever we've got
a good pilot, who knows the coast,
and can weather the point, as the say∣ing
is. As for the enemy's vessel, she
has had a shot or two already a-thwart
her fore-foot: the next, I do suppose,
will strike the hull, and then you'll
see her taken all a-back.” The doc∣tor,
who perfectly understood his dia∣lect,
assured him he might depend
upon his assistance; and advancing to
the knight, accosted him in these
words: “Sir Launcelot Greaves, your
most humble servant.—When I saw
<PB N="244" REF="249"/>
a croud at the door, I little thought
of finding you within, treated with
such indignity.—Yet I can't help be∣ing
pleased with an opportunity of
proving the esteem and veneration I
have for your person and character:
—you will do me a particular pleasure
in commanding my best services.”</P>
<P>Our adventurer thanked him for this
instance of his friendship, which he told
him he would use without hesitation;
and desired he would procure imme∣diate
bail for him and his two friends,
who had been imprisoned, contrary to
law, without any cause assigned. Du∣ring
this short dialogue, the justice,
who had heard of Sir Launcelot's fa∣mily
and fortune, though an utter
stranger to his person, was seized with
such pangs of terror and compunction,
as a grovelling mind may be supposed
to have felt in such circumstances; and
they seemed to produce the same un∣savoury
effects that are so humorously
delineated by the inimitable Hogarth
in the print of Felix on his tribunal,
done in the Dutch stile. Nevertheless,
seeing Fillet retire to execute the
<PB N="245" REF="250"/>
knight's commands, he recollected
himself so far as to tell the prisoners
there was no occasion to give them∣selves
any further trouble; for he
would release them without bail or
mainprize. Then discarding all the
insolence from his features, and as∣suming
an aspect of the most hum∣ble
adulation, he begged the knight
ten thousand pardons for the freedoms
he had taken, which were intirely
owing to his ignorance of Sir Launce∣lot's
quality. “Yes, I'll assure you,
Sir, (said the wife), my husband would
have bit off his tongue, rather than say
black is the white of your eye, if so be
he had known your capacity.—Thank
God, we have been used to deal with
gentlefolks, and many's the good
pound we have lost by them; but
what of that? Sure we know how to
behave to our betters. Mr. Gobble,
thanks be to God, can desy the whole
world to prove that he ever said an
uncivil word, or did a rude thing to a
gentleman, knowing him to be a per∣son
of fortune, Indeed, as to your
poor gentry and riff-raff, your tag,
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
rag, and bobtail, or such vulgar scoun∣drelly
people, he has always behaved
like a magistrate, and treated them
with the rigger of authority.” “In
other words (said the knight), he has
tyrannized over the poor, and connived
at the vices of the rich: your husband
is little obliged to you for this con∣fession,
woman.” “Woman! (cried
Mrs. Gobble, impurpled with wrath,
and fixing her hands on her sides by
way of defiance) I scorn your words.
—Marry come up, woman! quotha:
no more a woman than your worship.”
Then bursting into tears, “Husband
(continued she), if you had the soul
of a louse, you would not suffer me
to be abused at this rate: you would
not sit still on the bench, and hear
your spouse called such contemptible
epitaphs.—Who cares for his title and
his knightship? You and I husband,
knew a taylor that was made a knight:
but, thank God, I have noblemen to
stand by me, with their privileges and
beroguetifs.”</P>
<P>At this instant Mr. Fillet returned
with his friend, a practitioner in the
<PB N="247" REF="252"/>
law, who freely offered to join in bail∣ing
our adventurer, and the other two
prisoners, for any sum that should be
required. The justice, perceiving the
affair began to grow more and more
serious, declared that he would dis∣charge
the warrants and dismiss the
prisoners. Here Mr. Clarke inter∣posing,
observed, that against the
knight no warrant had been granted,
nor any information sworn to; con∣sequently,
as the justice had not com∣plied
with the form of proceeding di∣rected
by statute, the imprisonment
was <HI>coram non judice,</HI> void. “Right,
Sir (said the other lawyer), if a jus∣tice
commits a felon for trial, with∣out
binding over the prosecutor to the
assizes, he shall be fined.”——“And
again (cried Clarke), if a justice issues
a warrant for commitment, where
there is no accusation, action will lie
against the justice.” “Moreover (re∣plied
the stranger), if a justice of peace
is guilty of any misdemeanour in his
office, information lies against him in
<HI>Banco Regis,</HI> where he shall be pu∣nished
by fine and imprisonment.”</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="253"/>
“And besides, (resumed the accurate
Tom), the same court will grant an
information against a justice of peace,
on motion, for sending even a servant
to the house of correction, or common
jail, without sufficient cause.” “True!
(exclaimed the other limb of the law)
and, for contempt of law, attachment
may be had against justices of peace in
<HI>Banco Regis.</HI> A justice of the peace
was fined a thousand marks for cor∣rupt
practices.” With these words
advancing to Mr. Clarke, he shook
him by the hand, with the appellation
of Brother, saying, “I doubt the
justice has got into a cursed hovel.”
Mr. Gobble himself seemed to be of
the same opinion. He changed co∣lour
several times during the remarks
which the lawyers had made; and
now, declaring that the gentlemen
were at liberty, begged, in the most
humble phrase, that the company
would eat a bit of mutton with him,
and after dinner the affair might be
amicably compromised. To this pro∣posal
our adventurer replied, in a
grave and resolute tone, “If your
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
acting in the commission as a justice
of the peace concerned my own par∣ticular
only, perhaps I should wave
any further inquiry, and resent your
insolence no other way but by silent
contempt. If I thought the er∣rors
of your administration proceeded
from a good intention, defeated by
want of understanding, I should pity
your ignorance, and, in compassion,
advise you to desist from acting a part
for which you are so ill qualified:
but the preposterous conduct of such
a man deeply affects the interest of
the community, especially that part
of it which, from its helpless situa∣tion,
is the more entitled to our pro∣tection
and assistance. I am more∣over
convinced, that your miscon∣duct
is not so much the consequence
of an uninformed head, as the poi∣sonous
issue of a malignant heart, de∣void
of humanity, inflamed with pride,
and rankling with revenge. The
common prison of this little town is
filled with the miserable objects of
your cruelty and oppression. Instead
of protecting the helpless, restraining
<PB N="250" REF="255"/>
the hands of violence, preserving the
public tranquility, and acting as a fa∣ther
to the poor, according to the in∣tent
and meaning of that institution
of which you are an unworthy mem∣ber,
you have distressed the widow
and the orphan, given a loose to all
the insolence of office, embroiled your
neighbours by fomenting suits and ani∣mosities,
and played the tyrant among
the indigent and forlorn. You have
abused the authority with which you
were invested, intailed a reproach up∣on
your office, and, instead of being
revered as a blessing, you are detested
as a curse among your fellow-crea∣tures.
This, indeed, is generally the
case of low fellows, who are thrust
into the magistracy without sentiment,
education, or capacity. Among other
instances of your iniquity, there is
now in prison an unhappy woman,
infinitely your superior in the advan∣tages
of birth, sense, and education,
whom you have, even without pro∣vocation,
persecuted to ruin and di∣straction,
after having illegally and
inhumanly kidnapped her only child,
<PB N="251" REF="256"/>
and exposed him to violent death in a
foreign land. Ah caitiff! if you were
to forego all the comforts of life, di∣stribute
your means among the poor,
and do the severest penance that ever
priestcraft prescribed, for the rest of your
days, you could not atone for the ruin
of that hapless family; a family through
whose sides you cruelly and perfidi∣ously
stabbed the heart of an innocent
young woman, to gratify the pride
and diabolical malice of that wretched
low-bred woman, who now sits at
your right hand as the associate of
power and presumption. Oh! if
such a despicable reptile shall annoy
mankind with impunity; if such a
contemptible miscreant shall have it in
his power to do such deeds of inhu∣manity
and oppression, what avails
the law? Where is our admired con∣stitution,
the freedom, the security
of the subject, the boasted humanity
of the British nation? Sacred Hea∣ven!
if there was no human institu∣tion
to take cognizance of such atro∣cious
crimes, I would listen to the
dictates of eternal justice, and, arm∣ing
<PB N="252" REF="257"/>
myself with the right of nature,
exterminate such villains from the
face of the earth!”</P>
<P>These last words he pronounced in
such a strain, while his eyes lightened
with indignation, that Gobble and his
wife underwent the most violent agi∣tation;
the constable's teeth chattered
in his head, the jailor trembled, and
the whole audience was overwhelmed
with consternation.</P>
<P>After a short pause, Sir Launcelot
proceeded in a milder strain: “Thank
Heaven, the laws of this country have
exempted me from the disagreeable
task of such an execution. To them
we shall have immediate recourse, in
three separate actions against you for
false imprisonment; and any other
person who has been injured by your
arbitrary and wicked proceedings, in
me shall find a warm protector, until
you shall be expunged from the com∣mission
with disgrace, and have made
such retaliation as your circumstances
will allow for the wrongs you have
done the community.”</P>
<P>In order to complete the mortifica∣tion
<PB N="253" REF="258"/>
and terror of the justice, the
lawyer, whose name was Fenton, de∣clared,
that, to his certain knowledge,
these actions would be reinforced with
divers prosecutions for corrupt practi∣ces,
which had lain dormant until
some person of courage and influence
should take the lead against justice
Gobble, who was the more dreaded
as he acted under the patronage of
lord Sharpington. By this time fear
had deprived the justice and his help∣mate
of the faculty of speech. They
were indeed almost petrified with dis∣may,
and made no effort to speak,
when Mr. Fillet, in the rear of the
knight, as he retired with his com∣pany,
took his leave of them in these
words:</P>
<P>“And now, Mr. Justice, to din∣ner
with what appetite you may.”
Our adventurer, though warmly in∣vited
to Mr. Fenton's house, repaired
to a public inn, where he thought
he should be more at his ease, fully
determined to punish and depose Gob∣ble
from his magistracy, to effect a
general jail-delivery of all the debtors
<PB N="254" REF="259"/>
whom he had found in confinement;
and, in particular, to rescue poor Mrs.
Oakley from the miserable circum∣stances
in which she was involved.</P>
<P>In the mean time, he insisted up∣on
entertaining his friends at dinner,
during which many sallies of sea-wit
and good-humour passed between
captain Crowe and doctor Fillet,
which last had just returned from a
neighbouring village, whither he was
summoned to fish a man's yard-arm,
which had snapt in the slings. Their
enjoyment, however, was suddenly
interrupted by a loud scream from the
kitchen, whither Sir Launcelot im∣mediately
sprung, with equal eager∣ness
and agility. There he saw the
landlady, who was a woman in years,
embracing a man dressed in a sailor's
jacket, while she exclaimed, “It is
thy own flesh and blood, so sure as
I'm a living soul.—Ah! poor Greaves,
poor Greaves, many a poor heart has
grieved for thee!” To this salutation
the youth replied, “I'm sorry for
that, mistress.—How does poor mo∣ther?
how does Sukey Sedgemore?”</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260"/>
The good woman of the house
could not help shedding tears at these
interrogations; while Sir Launcelot,
interposing, said, not without emo∣tion,
“I perceive you are the son of
Mrs. Oakley.—Your mother is in a
bad state of health; but in me you
will find a real parent.” Perceiving
that the young man eyed him with
astonishment, he gave him to under∣stand
that his name was Launcelot
Greaves.</P>
<P>Oakley no sooner heard these words
pronounced, than he fell upon his
knees, and seizing the knight's hand,
kissed it eagerly, crying, “God for
ever bless your honour: I am your
name-son, sure enough—but what of
that? I can earn my bread, without
being beholden to any man.”</P>
<P>When the knight raised him up, he
turned to the woman of the house,
saying, “I want to see mother. I'm
afraid as how times are hard with her;
and I have saved some money for her
use.” This instance of filial duty
brought tears into the eyes of our ad∣venturer,
<PB N="256" REF="261"/>
who assured him his mo∣ther
should be carefully attended, and
want for nothing: but that it would
be very improper to see her at present,
as the surprize might shock her too
much, considering that she believed
him dead. “Ey, indeed, (cried the
landlady) we were all of the same
opinion, being as the report went that
poor Greaves Oakley was killed in
battle.” “Lord mistress, (said Oak∣ley)
there wan'n't a word of truth in it,
I'll assure you.—What, d'ye think I'd
tell a lie about the matter? Hurt I
was, to be sure; but that don't signify:
we gave 'em as good as they brought,
and so parted.—Well, if so be I can't
see mother, I'll go and have some chat
with Sukey.—What d'ye look so glum
for? she an't married, is she?” “No,
no, (replied the woman) not mar∣ried;
but almost heart-broken. Since
thou wast gone, she has done nothing
but sighed, and wept, and pined her∣self
into a decay. I'm afraid thou ha'st
come too late to save her life.”</P>
<P>Oakley's heart was not proof against
this information. Bursting into tears,
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
he exclaimed, “O my dear, sweet,
gentle Sukey! Have I then lived to be
the death of her whom I loved more
than the whole world!” He would
have gone instantly to her father's
house; but was restrained by the knight
and his company, who had now joined
him in the kitchen. The young man
was seated at table, and gave them to
understand, that the ship to which he
belonged having arrived in England,
he was indulged with a month's leave
to see his relations; and that he had
received about fifty pounds in wages
and prize-money. After dinner, just
as they began to deliberate upon the
measures to be taken against Gobble,
that gentleman arrived at the inn, and
humbly craved admittance. Mr. Fil∣let,
struck with a sudden idea, retired
into another apartment with the young
farmer; while the justice, being ad∣mitted
to the company, declared that
he came to propose terms of accom∣modation.
He accordingly offered to
ask pardon of Sir Launcelot in the pub∣lic
papers, and pay fifty pounds to the
poor of the parish, as an atonement
<PB N="258" REF="263"/>
for his misbehaviour, provided the
knight and his friends would grant
him a general release. Our adventurer
told him, he would willingly wave
all personal concessions; but, as the
case concerned the community, he in∣sisted
upon his leaving off acting in
the commission, and making satisfac∣tion
to the parties he had injured and
oppressed. This declaration introdu∣ced
a discussion, in the course of which
the justice's petulance began to revive;
when Fillet, entering the room, told
them he had a reconciling measure to
propose, if Mr. Gobble would for a
few minutes withdraw. He rose up
immediately, and was shewn into the
room which Fillet had prepared for his
reception. While he sat musing on
this untoward adventure, so big with
disgrace and disappointment, young
Oakley, according to the instructions
he had received, appeared all at once
before him, pointing to a ghastly
wound, which the doctor had painted
on his forehead. The apparition no
sooner presented itself to the eyes of
Gobble, than, taking it for granted it
<PB N="259" REF="264"/>
was the spirit of the young farmer
whose death he had occasioned, he
roared aloud, “Lord have mercy up∣on
us!” and fell insensible on the floor.
There being found by the company,
to whom Fillet had communicated
his contrivance, he was conveyed to
bed, where he lay some time before
he recovered the perfect use of his sen∣ses.
Then he earnestly desired to see
the knight, and assured him he was
ready to comply with his terms, inas∣much
as he believed he had not long
to live. Advantage was immediately
taken of this salutary disposition. He
bound himself not to act as a justice
of the peace, in any part of Great-Britain,
under the penalty of five
thousand pounds. He burned Mrs.
Oakley's note; payed the debts of the
shopkeeper; undertook to compound
those of the publican, and to settle
him again in business; and, finally,
discharged them all from prison, pay∣ing
the dues out of his own pocket.
These steps being taken with peculiar
eagerness, he was removed to his own
house, where he assured his wife he
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
had seen a vision that prognosticated
his death; and had immediate re∣course
to the curate of the parish for
spiritual consolation.</P>
<P>The most interesting part of the
task that now remained, was to make
the widow Oakley acquainted with
her good fortune, in such a manner
as might least disturb her spirits, al∣ready
but too much discomposed.
For this purpose they chose the land∣lady,
who, after having received pro∣per
directions how to regulate her
conduct, visited her in prison that same
evening. Finding her quite calm,
and her reflection perfectly restored,
she began with exhorting her to put
her trust in Providence, which would
never forsake the cause of the injured
widow and fatherless: she promised
to assist and befriend her on all oc∣casions,
as far as her abilities would
reach: she gradually turned the con∣versation
upon the family of the
Greaves; and by degrees informed
her, that Sir Launcelot, having learn∣ed
her situation, was determined to
extricate her from all her troubles.
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
Perceiving her astonished, and deeply
affected at this intimation, she artfully
shifted the discourse, recommended
resignation to the Divine Will, and
observed, that this circumstance seem∣ed
to be an earnest of further happi∣ness.
“O! I'm incapable of receiv∣ing
more! (cried the disconsolate wi∣dow,
with streaming eyes)—Yet I
ought not to be surprised at any blessing
that flows from that quarter.—The
family of Greaves were always vir∣tuous,
humane, and benevolent.—
This young gentleman's mother was
my dear lady and benefactress:—he
himself was suckled at these breasts.
—O! he was the sweetest, comeliest,
best conditioned babe!—I loved not
my own Greaves with greater affection
—but, he, alas! is now no more!”
“Have patience, good neighbour,
(said the landlady of the White Hart)
that is more than you have any right
to affirm.—All that you know of the
matter is by common report, and
common report is commonly false:
besides, I can tell you I have seen a
list of the men that were killed in ad∣miral
<PB N="262" REF="267"/>
P—'s ship, when he sought
the French in the East-Indies, and
your son was not in the number.”
To this intimation she replied, after a
considerable pause, “Don't, my good
neighbour, don't feed me with false
hope.—My poor Greaves too certainly
perished in a foreign land—yet he is
happy:—had he lived to see me in
this condition, grief would soon have
put a period to his days.” “I tell
you then, (cried the visitant) he is
not dead. I have seen a letter that
mentions his being well since the bat∣tle.
You shall come along with me—
you are no longer a prisoner, but shall
live at my house comfortably, till your
affairs are settled to your wish.”</P>
<P>The poor widow followed her in
silent astonishment, and was imme∣diately
accommodated with necessaries.</P>
<P>Next morning her hostess proceed∣ed
with her in the same cautious man∣ner,
until she was assured that her
son had returned. Being duly pre∣pared,
she was blessed with a sight of
poor Greaves, and fainted away in
his arms.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="268"/>
We shall not dwell upon this ten∣der
scene, because it is but of a secon∣dary
concern in the history of our
knight-errant: let it suffice to say,
their mutual happiness was unspeak∣able.
She was afterwards visited by Sir
Launcelot, whom she no sooner be∣held,
than, springing forwards with
all the eagerness of maternal affection,
she clasped him to her breast, crying,
“My dear child! my Launcelot!
my pride! my darling! my kind be∣nefactor!
This is not the first time I
have hugged you in these arms! O!
you are the very image of Sir Ever∣hard
in his youth; but you have got
the eyes, the complexion, the sweet∣ness,
and complacency of my dear
and ever-honoured lady.” This was
not in the strain of hireling praise;
but the genuine tribute of esteem and
admiration. As such, it could not
but be agreeable to our hero, who
undertook to procure Oakley's dis∣charge,
and settle him in a comfort∣able
farm on his own estate.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Greaves went
with a heavy heart to the house of
<PB N="264" REF="269"/>
farmer Sedgemore, where he found
Sukey, who had been prepared for
his reception, in a transport of joy,
though very weak, and greatly ema∣ciated.
Nevertheless, the return of
her sweet-heart had such an happy
effect on her constitution, that in a
few weeks her health was perfectly
restored.</P>
<P>This adventure of our knight was
crowned with every happy circum∣stance
that could give pleasure to a
generous mind. The prisoners were
released, and reinstated in their for∣mer
occupations. The justice per∣formed
his articles from fear; and
afterwards turned over a new leaf
from remorse. Young Oakley was
married to Sukey, with whom he re∣ceived
a considerable portion. The
new-married couple found a farm
ready stocked for them on the knight's
estate; and the mother enjoyed a
happy retreat in the character of the
house-keeper at Greavesbury-hall.</P>
