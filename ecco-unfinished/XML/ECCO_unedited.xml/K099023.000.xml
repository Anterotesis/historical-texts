<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN madly zealous our Divines engage</L>
<L>To mend the Morals of a vicious Age;</L>
<L>When Interest only over Faith presides,</L>
<L>And Fools or Knaves are Ministers and Guides;</L>
<L>When Laws divine a Property are made,</L>
<L>And Blockheads deal in Scripture as a Trade:</L>
<L>Honest the Hand whose Satyr would expose,</L>
<L>O! Sacred Truth, the greatest of thy Foes;</L>
<L>And shew Mankind by what a monstrous Course</L>
<L>The Weak are vicious, and the Wicked worse:</L>
<L>No private Pique this Just Resentment draws,</L>
<L>Or brands a wretched <HI>Squintum,</HI> or his Cause;</L>
<L>But since the Laws no Punishment provide</L>
<L>For such as draw the Multitude aside,</L>
<L>The Poet seizes the corrective Rod,</L>
<L>To scourge the bold Blasphemer of his God.</L>
<L>Happy in this Dramatical Essay,</L>
<L>If One should see the Error of his Way;</L>
<L>He heeds not what a Sectary replies,</L>
<L>Nor fears the Anger which he must despise.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW well our Author has performed his Part,</L>
<L>Or shewn a Knowledge of the human Heart;</L>
<L>How well preserv'd the Characters he drew,</L>
<L>Is now submitted to the Public View;—</L>
<L>If in his Scenes Hypocrisy appears</L>
<L>To wear her Form of Sanctity and Years;</L>
<L>If secret Crimes are happily disclos'd,</L>
<L>And Vice at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nte is punish'd and exposed;</L>
<L>If injur'd Virtue has alarm'd a Fear,</L>
<L>Or drawn from Love, or Tenderness—a Tear,</L>
<L>His End is answer'd—for his only Aim</L>
<L>Would reach Instruction, and not soar to Fame;</L>
<L>But if misled, should Justice know a Stand,</L>
<L>And Rancoun snatch the Pencil from her Hand▪</L>
<L>Should Satyr stoop to give a lawless Stroke,</L>
<L>And Truth be vanquish'd for an idle Joke;</L>
<L>Should real Worth of Virulence complain,</L>
<L>Or Merit feel a momentary Pain;</L>
<L>He owns the Error with a conscious Shame,</L>
<L>And is himself, the very first to blame.</L>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Heated! abused! bubbled!—O 'tis too much: all the Water in the Jordan can never wash away the Remembrance of this Day's Disgrace—and then to be threatened with a Cart—What I! who am as intimate with the Justices as the Keeper

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Daughter, I pray you moderate the Tide of your Resentment, lest it should overflow the Banks of your Reason, and sweep away all the cha∣ritable Landmarks of Christianity, I have taken so much Trouble to erect. Consider that Revenge is a very revengeful Ingredient in the System of the Heart; and that by being revengeful it is wicked, and consequently a great Wickedness to encourage it in the Mind—I say therefore, Daughter, open the Eyes of your Understanding, and let Discretion teach you how to guide your Steps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O! the dear good Man! what a de∣lightful Way he has of instructing a Body!—But, Dear Sir, please to consider that my Reputation is hurt in the severest Degree; and can I patiently suffer any Body to take away my good Name, without shewing the charitable Force of my whole Resentment; for as one of the prophane Fellows who delights the Eyes of the Play-loving Gene∣ration of the Children of Vanity, at the next Door, when one of my Waiters struck him a Punch in the Stomach, he cried out, "Proud <HI>Spaniard</HI> thou shalt feel me;" and threw a Bottle of Port at the Fellow's Head, which unfortunately missed him, broke my large Looking Glass, and spoiled my Green Damask Window Curtains. I am sure they
<PB N="3" REF="7"/>
have behaved like <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> to me, and yet I must be patient, forsooth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> Nay, pray!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you are going to say, Sir, but consider that I have maintained her a long Time: cloathed her when she was naked; fed her when she was hungry; and comforted her in Distress; nay, Did I not bring her thrice a Day to the Tabernacle to receive your pious Instruc∣tions? And yet, after all, when I was going to make a reasonable Profit of what I had so generously supported, to find her run counter to all my Ex∣pectations, and throw herself upon the very filthy Fellow who has threatened me with a Cart—her Cousin indeed—Yes, I suppose, by this Time they are very loving Cousins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> every Turn of Fortune we are to look upon as happening for the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know, Sir, what you are going to say; for the better; but this is an Instance to the contrary, for I am sure these Crosses only happen for the worse. Five and fifty good Pounds, besides a Wound to my Reputation that all the Attend∣ance of Doctor <HI>Rock</HI> can never heal up, could scarcely happen for the better, at a Time when I am so regular in my Attendance at <HI>Tottenham Court,</HI> and the <HI>Moorfields</HI> Tabernacle—and so, I say again, "Proud <HI>Spaniard</HI> thou shalt feel me;" if there's e'er an Oath to be had for Love or Money, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thin the Parish of <HI>St. Paul, Covent-Garden.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> I begin to be very much concerned about you; this is the second Time you have repeated an infernal Line out of a blas∣phemous Play-book; and what is a greater Scan∣dal to Religion, a Line, if I mistake not, written by a Minister of the Faith, in a diabolical Per∣formance called <HI>The Revenge.</HI>—Fine Instructions in∣deed we are likely to have, when our Clergymen are more concerned about what they produce for the Stage, than what they compose for the Pulpit! fine Times indeed are we likely to have, when such a Fellow as FOOTE is suffered to ridicule the sancti∣fied, the orthodox Discourses which I myself have delivered at the Tabernacle, to the no small Edifi∣cation of Hundreds of poor Souls who wanted some Nourishment for a troubled Spirit.—I am, I say, therefore, concerned to think that you, who are a real Pattern of the primitive Purity, should pollute your Mouth with the odious Repetition of those detestable Vanities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Some Allowance, Sir, should be made for the Heat of Passion; this is one of the human In∣firmities; and I am sure I heard you say, Sir, notwith∣standing your utmost Endeavours, you could never totally divest yourself of it; and if so good, so great, so—I don't know what to say, but good and great a Man as yourself is ever disturbed by the Calami∣ties of Life, I am sure it's no Wonder that I should be affected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, Daughter, you say right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In order, then, Sir, to procure Sa∣tisfaction for the Injuries I have suffered, and in some Measure to revenge the Affronts offered to Religion by the Abuse of a Woman of my exemplary Life, I have a Scheme, Sir, upon which I shall beg the Favour of your Advice; and if your Assistance could be obtained, I am in no Fear of carrying it into Execution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's nothing, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> I can deny to a Woman of your extraordinary Virtue; much less refuse to lend my helping Hand to any Thing that may be in the least conducive to Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then simply, Sir, the Case is this: as that ungrateful Baggage, <HI>Lucy,</HI> has been the principal Cause of this Day's Disturbance; I say the principal Means by which my hitherto unsul∣lied Reputation has suffered, suppose I was to re∣turn the Compliment, and wound hers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain, Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why she is to be married to this young Fellow, this Mr. <HI>Wealthy,</HI> To-morrow Morning: suppose we contrive some Means of making him believe she has been already blown upon—The young Fellow has a pretty Sort of Pride about him, which I dare say would never suffer him to marry a Woman another Man had been free with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> Would you endea∣vour to blast an innocent young Woman's Reputa∣tion, and destroy the Peace of a Family that may possibly have set their Hearts upon this very Match
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
you would endeavour to prevent?—Christianity, Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, they don't go to the Ta∣bernacle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true, Mrs. <HI>Cole;</HI> and though those that are not for us are against us, yet we must consider Charity and brotherly Love, and always endeavour to do as we would done by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir! but suppose this very Me∣thod should oblige the young Woman to leave the Error of her Ways, and flee from the Wrath to come; you would have no Objection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not any, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> but how can that be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know, Sir, upon this young Fellow's Refusal of her, the Cause must naturally be assigned; and that may perhaps get Wind, and prevent any other Match, or possibly enflame the impetuosity of her Father's Temper, to turn her again out of Doors; and we have many Instances Sir, where the Cruelty of a Father, and the Neglect of a Lover have furnished the Tabernacle with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rouds, and the Garden with Votaries. I am sure the principal Part of my Profit and your Reputa∣tion have flowed from one of these Quarters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Madam,—and since you bring it to my Remembrance, Pray how does <HI>Diana Dieaway,</HI> the Milliner's Apprentice that used to be so constant an Attendant on my <HI>Tuesday</HI> Evening Lectures?</P>

<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
Why do you know that the Jade has been impudent enough to say that it was presumptuous to attend the Service of the Faithful while she followed a Course of Life so opposite to her Conscience—As if every body ought not to labour in their Vo∣cation, Mr. <HI>Squintum</HI>—Lord have Mercy on me! what a wicked World we live in—But to the pre∣sent Business—Oh! Oh! I am so troubled with the Cholic, I must have a Drop of <HI>Holland</HI>'s Geneva—Will you be so good to pull that Bell, Sir? <STAGE>(He rings.</STAGE></P>

<P>Bring the Geneva Bottle—Perhaps Sir, you would rather drink a Glass of Brandy and Bitters, than any of this delicious <HI>Strip-me-naked</HI>—Here, Sir, to the Encrease of the Faith, and the primitive Practice of Dunghill Preaching.—But <HI>Dick,</HI> was Mr. <HI>Spindleshanks</HI> the old Counsellor from the <HI>Temple</HI> here about <HI>Sukey Bawlabout</HI> the Milkmaid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, to be sure! Well, well, what will become of this House when I am gone, the Lord only knows—I see I am deserted, forsaken—O Mr. <HI>Squintum,</HI> it's a vexatious Thing to keep such a House as I do, and be at the Expence of providing such delicious Morsels for the Recreation of my Custo∣mers, and yet to be utterly cast off, entirely neg∣lected—These were two of the best Chaps that ever tumbled a Cambrick Apron, a Couple of never failing Customers, the one was only son<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a fine
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
Head of Hair, and the other of a Set of Teeth as white as whip'd Syllabub; and I had the strongest Hopes of bringing them both to a due Sense of Religion, and a proper Concern for their future Welfare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Mrs. <HI>Cole</HI> you meet with a Num∣ber of Difficulties in the Exercise of your Profes∣sion, and I am sure I am not without a Share of them in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We are both persecuted, Sir; both severely handled by the Malice of the wicked ones, but it's a comfort to think that one's own Conscience can accuse one with nothing; and that the more we suffer here, the more we shall enjoy in the New <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to come—But as I was saying, Sir,—Come, Sir, take another Drop, it will keep the Wind out of your Stomach, Sir, and get you an Appetite for Dinner—But as I was saying, Sir—How do you approve of my Design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> I don't know how I can with any Propriety give my Consent to what I cannot absolutely approve; nor do I apprehend of what Service I can possibly be in the Affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Infinite, Sir, infinite.—Your Charac∣ter, Sir, your Character will add a Weight to any Thing I assert, and if the least Doubt should arise concerning the Accusations I shall lay at the Hussey's Door; you know, Sir, your only mentioning her having formerly confessed such a Circumstance to you, will be sufficient to make the whole Story cre∣dited; and by this Means I hope to have this head∣strong

<P>Well, Mrs. <HI>Cole;</HI> upon Consideration—</P>

<P>O dear, Sir! don't name it; if I get the Girl again, we go Snacks in the—Oh! Oh! Oh! my Stomach: What shall I do with my Stomach!—You know, Sir, I always deal upon Honour with you.—You remember the Affair of <HI>Molly Catgut,</HI> the Fidler's Daughter in this Neighbourhood, you not only had half the Cole, but a Cargo of pious Hymns and Thanksgiving Sermons for the Colo∣nies in <HI>America</HI> into the Bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Squint.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> I have no Doubt of that Nature; but how do you intend proceeding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Cole.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Leave that entirely to me, Sir: Mr. <HI>Shift,</HI> who was employed in that hopeful Affair of young <HI>Wealthy</HI>'s, to personate an Auctioneer, by the Father, for the Promise of a great Reward, has been suddenly discarded: He waits now in another Room for my Instructions; and what from the Hopes of what he shall get from me, and an equal Desire of revenging the Treatment he has received himself, I am satisfied his utmost Endeavours will not be wanting in promoting so good a Design. Ah! Sir, if you could but prevail on him to change his wick∣ed Course of Life, and become a Frequenter of the Assembly of the Faithful, it would be a meritorious Action indeed.</P>

Why, Child, if you behave in the same Manner to your Customers, you'll soon have no Lo∣vers, but a Set of Hypocritical Methodists, or some of the Society for the Reformation of Manners, who will inform against a poor Woman for endea∣vouring to maintain herself and Half a Dozen Chil∣dren by Selling a Basket of Apples on a Sunday E∣vening.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, upon my Word, you are entitled to my Thanks for generously forgiving Mr. <HI>Loader</HI> at my Request.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my dear <HI>Lucy,</HI> is there any one Re∣quest in my Power to grant, that would be my Incli∣nation to deny my Angel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are extremely obliging, my dear Coz. indeed, and your Manner of conferring is no in∣considerable Part of an Obligation, let me assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young.</SPEAKER>
<P>Engaging Creature! I am almost tempted to think, with some Satisfaction, on the Libertine I have been, since it makes me doubly sensible of Ex∣cellence like your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my dear Coz. If a Disposition so truly polite, were as lasting after Matrimony, as professing before it, we should have a Number of happier Couples within the Bills of Mortality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Lady fair, I am very much of your Opinion in this Matter, though to shew you I have a Sincerity equal to the Politeness you are pleased to compliment, I must freely tell you that you have us what you make us; and while the Women are so passionately fond of Red Coats and Coxcombs, 'tis
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
not to be wondered at if they are lessened in the Opi∣nion of Men of Sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to see these Men of Sense, my dear Coz. the Slaves of the very Women they despise, and cap∣tivated by a Person they look upon with Contempt, is something extraordinary and ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, it is so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never can forbear laughing when I see a mighty Man of Understanding affect to look down upon a poor insignificant Creature, because she is either insensible of his Merit, or has given a Look of Approbation to somebody else; whereas, had she but flattered his Vanity, there is not one Perfection in the whole Catalogue he would not have thought her possessed of, and she might have managed the self-sufficient Gentleman as easy as her Monkey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! Why, my Dear, you are infinitely witty; though there is a good Deal of the Satyrical about you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! my dear Coz. What is the Reason a Woman should not be as fond of a Fool of your Sex, as you are of an Idiot of ours.—The Moment a Wo∣man likes a Man's Person, I fancy she thinks him possessed of every Accomplishment she could wish, and if he is not blest with an extraordinary Share of Understanding or improved by Education, he is ge∣nerally more upon a Level with herself, and better suited to her Capacity, so that she never finds out the Error of her Choice, but is infinitely happy in the fortunate Delusion; whereas the Men, my dear Coz. love and despise.</P>

<P>Why my dear Philosopher in Petti∣coats, you are for tracing Matters up to their Source, I find; though I assure you so great a Proof of your good Sense makes me not a little vain of your Partiality to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>O your most obedient:—But for In∣stance; that very Mr. <HI>Loader</HI> now, that your Humanity has forgiven a Crime that really de∣served to be treated with Severity, is so pretty a Fellow that he might do vast Execution among the Ladies Hearts at a Country Assembly; and though they were acquainted with his Actions, yet they would only look upon that as an Error or Oversight in him, that would be unpardonable in a Man with a Person less agreeable.</P>

<P>I ask your Pardon, Sir. When I came in, the Conversation turned upon you, Sir, and hearing that you were to be married to-morrow to Miss <HI>Lucy,</HI> they all burst into a violent Fit of Laughing. At length the old Beldame recovered, and wiping her nasty Muns with a greasy Towel, declared she was now satisfied, and could die con∣tented. Upon the whole, Sir, I found that <HI>Loa∣der</HI> had been pretty well acquainted with Miss <HI>Lucy,</HI> and that it was a Scheme of his and Mrs. <HI>Cole</HI>'s to introduce her to you in the Character they did, that by that Means she might impose upon your Good-nature, and effect a Reconciliation with her Family; as they seemed to think her Face not altogether new enough for the Garden.</P>

<P>I see Sir you don't know the World,—Why Artifice, mere Artifice to excite your Curi∣osity, and, by an affected Concern for the Ho∣nour of her Father, to make a Merit of her Silence, if she should happen to be restored. Do you think, Sir, <HI>Moll Cole</HI> would have kept her so long in her House unless she could have got something by her.—And besides, was not her first Request the Forgiveness of <HI>Loader?</HI></P>

<P>Yours.—How besotted was I not to find this out sooner!

<PB N="26" REF="32"/>
Girl.—But though in the few Hours of my Ac∣quaintance with her, she has made an Impression on my Heart that can never be erased; yet the Strings shall crack to Pieces, before I do any Thing repugnant to my Reason, or contrary to my Honour—But Mr. <HI>Loader,</HI> keep out of my Way, I beg of you. And Oh! <HI>Lucy</HI> never see me more. How unaccountable that we must love to Distraction what should be the Object of our greatest Contempt!—But stay—As <HI>Shift</HI> says, this may be no more than a concerted Design from the Disappointment of <HI>Loader,</HI> and the Re∣venge of Mrs. <HI>Cole;</HI> nay, <HI>Shift</HI> himself may be engaged to carry it on. But then she begged <HI>Loader</HI> off, and not a Quarter of an Hour ago she praised him to my Face.—But for all that she may be innocent.—Ay, but the Doubt that she is so, is more insupportable than the Conviction of her Guilt; and <HI>Caesar</HI> I find was not in the least to be blamed when he said it was not enough for his Wife to be virtuous, she must be unsuspected also.—Nay, I find in myself so great a Repug∣nance to a Woman that but even thought of ano∣ther Man, that though I loved her to Death, I must sacrifice my Passion to my Pride; for the Man that could stoop to succeed another in the Inclination of any Woman, would stoop to take her polluted from the Arms of any Man; and the Woman that can love a second Time is too contemptible to be loved at all.</P>

<P><STAGE>[To the Servant.]</STAGE> Very well,—tell the Fellow I shall be punctual to a Moment. <STAGE>(Exit Servant.)</STAGE> Now there is another corroborating Circumstance of <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Dishonour. <STAGE>[Throws the Letter on a Table.]</STAGE> I have remarked that Girl <HI>Jenny Cummins</HI> to be vastly superior to the common Class of Creatures with whom her unhappy Situation obliges her to herd; something so open, honest, and undesigning about her, as more than once has excited both my Admiration and my Pity.
<PB N="28" REF="34"/>
The Villain <HI>Loader</HI> under the most solemn Pro∣mises of eternal Fidelity, won her unsuspecting Heart, and from the strongest Assurances of his marrying her, she yielded, and was undone: Their Commerce was no sooner known, than her Friends abandoned her, and turned her out of Doors; and to compleat her Misfortunes, she was left destitute of the Necessaries of Life, by her scandalous Seducer, in a Situation that re∣quired the utmost Tenderness and Care.—Then it was she met the pious Mrs. <HI>Cole,</HI> who from a pretended Concern for her Welfare, obtained her Confidence and Esteem. After her Delivery the old Beldame made her Proposals which were re∣ceived with Horror; but the Terrors of a Gaol, and the exquisite Force of a Mother's Fondness for the Preservation of her Infant, got the better at length of her Resolution, and she was obliged to consent. She has heard, I suppose, of this Affair of mine, and from her Knowledge of <HI>Lucy</HI>'s Behaviour, wants to put me upon my Guard. The Difficulty now is, how to break off the Match with Honour, without exposing the unfortunate Girl, or destroying the Reputation of my own Family; for Oh! I love her too well to see her despised by any Body—but myself. What an artful Tale did she tell of destitute Vir∣tue and Innocence preserved! But at any Rate it is concluded; I have done with her. Oh! here she comes. What well-dissembled Modesty in her Looks! She's damn'd impudent, I see that.
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
I wonder I never found it before. Ay, and seems to have lost so much of her Beauty this half Hour, that I think her cursed ugly too.</P>

Young Master gone in; and when <HI>George</HI> knows you act by my Direction, to surprize him in Com∣pany with his Lady, won't appear so improper in you.—I shall be after you in a short Time, and let him know what he owes to your Intercession and Goodness; and if this does not shame him out of his Errors and awaken a real Tenderness for you, I must give him up as irrecoverable.</P>

<P><HI>George,</HI>—only mind how surprized she looks!—Why, Madam, was it not enough to indulge▪a licentious Inclination, when your Obstinacy drove you from a Father's House; and when, perhaps, the Commission of the Crime might be extenuated by the Necessity; (if any Necessity could plead for Loss of Honour) but when your Follies were forgotten; when you was again received to the Bosom of your Friends, and

He that is Whole needeth no Physician; and twou'd be a needless Trouble to be always preaching to the Righteous: I shall stand in need, therefore, of no further Pre∣face to vindicate my Conduct; and will solemn∣ly assure you, the young Woman herself, du∣ring her Residence at Mrs. <HI>Cole</HI>'s, with Tears, (for I verily believe the Seeds of Repent∣ance have been sown in her Heart) confessed that <HI>Loader</HI> had undone her.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Will.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Scandalous, despicable, hypocritical Villain,—I see your poor Design, and Vengeance shall repay it. What, a Clergyman, a Minister of Heaven, an Expounder of the Sacred Oracles of Truth, whose Life ought to be the clearest Imitation of his glorious Master's Conduct, join in a Scheme, a damnable Design, to blast the Flowers of Innocence and destroy the very Root of Virtue; enter into a League with an abo∣minable Woman, whose Profession should render her the Contempt, the Abhorrence of Mankind, to ruin the Peace and Honour of a worthy Family that never wronged you.—Surprizing that in a Neighbourhood where Justice boasts of her Vi∣gilance, she should be blind! Or, that such a Num∣ber of infernal Houses should be tollerated in a Country fraught with the noblest Sentiments

<P>I see we are all in the wrong Box here; I think I'll tack about, and make my Peace with old Dryboots. <STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE> Sir, I have been a damn'd Rascal, and I own it; I don't know whether I should hope for Pardon, or whether you ought to grant it; but when I assure you I was instigated by this Son of a Bitch of a Preacher, and this Bitch of a Whore of a Bawd, and thought myself not quite so well used in your Affair, as I had Rea∣son to expect, I hope you may be induced to overlook that Part I have acted in this cursed Day's Work, as I shall be ready to prove in any Court of Justice, the Truth of whatever Charge you may exhibit against them both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Will.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Upon that Condition, Sir, you may may expect to be forgiven—But <HI>George,</HI> why don't you say something to <HI>Lucy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Weal.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my Heart's so full on this Occa∣sion, that I cannot find Words to ask the dear Girl's Pardon for the Uneasiness I have given her; but as the Confusion was general, the Mistake she laboured under on her Side, will, I hope, incline her to forgive any Anxiety on mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucy.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, my dear Coz. your forgetting that Letter was a very fortunate Circumstance; for without the little Confusion it occasioned, I can't see how Matters would have been so happily reconciled—But don't think I was jealous of you—
<PB N="57" REF="63"/>
I must not allow you to flatter yourself so much as to think I was jealous of you when I followed you to the Tavern, to surprize you with this La∣dy, to whom I think we are both not a little in∣debted.</P>

<P>No Raptures now, dear Coz. I beg of you, for Mr. <HI>Loader</HI> is not gone out of the Room yet.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. <HI>Weal.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I can clear up that Affair too. Perhaps all the Company may not be informed that Mr. <HI>Loader</HI> is the Author of my Ruin; how∣ever, he is so, and though his Behaviour has made me really despise him, yet the foolish Woman in my Heart obliges me to love him still; an unsuc∣cessful Run at Cards after his Detection at Sir <HI>William</HI>'s, had reduced him to some Necessity, and as I expected a Sum of Money that Evening, from a Gentleman, I desired Mr. <HI>Loader</HI> would call on me here, and he asking for a Lady, was, by Mistake, I suppose, shewn up to Miss <HI>Lucy,</HI> and so caused all Mr. <HI>Wealthy</HI>'s Uneasiness after∣wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I am a Person greatly obliged by your Behaviour to-day, and if any Thing in my Power can be conducive to your Interest, I shall take it as a Favour if you command me.—O <HI>Lucy!</HI> forgive my Rashness, and be henceforth assured of your Father's greatest Confidence and Esteem.</P>

<P>O, Sir, you had all the Reason in the World to imagine—.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more. The Hundred a Year I talk∣ed of to you, shall be settled on this Lady for Life,—for I am convinced, if it was in her Power to live without her Errors, she would forsake them: But as for Mrs. <HI>Cole, Squintum,</HI> and <HI>Loader</HI> they shall experience the utmost Severity of the Law,—If an Hundred Pounds can buy it.</P>

<P>I understand you.—On your Account he shall be forgiven; and if you think the Ras∣cal's marrying you would be any Satisfaction, it shall be on that Consideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir,—I don't know!—Bless me!—What shall I do!—No, Sir, I de∣spair of reclaiming Mr. <HI>Loader</HI> from his Fol∣lies; and though I must love him, I would not choose to be married to any Man that might up∣braid me with my past Life, and on whom I must look with Contempt.</P>
