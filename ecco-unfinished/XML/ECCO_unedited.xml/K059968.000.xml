<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am so sensible of the Nicety of
the following Subject, and the
Ill-nature of the Age, that tho'
I have <HI>Introduc'd</HI> it with all the Pro∣testations
of a resolv'd Caution, and of
tying my self down to all possible Modesty
in the whole Work; and tho' I have <HI>con∣cluded</HI>
it with due Explanations, and a free
Appeal to the most impartial Judges, yet I
cannot but add a Word of <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
THE justness of the Satyr, the loud
Calls which the Crimes (here reproved)
make for Justice and a due Censure, the
dreadful Ruin of the People's Morals, and
the apparent Contempt of Modesty and De∣cency,
which grows so visibly upon us by
the shameless Practice of what is here re∣prov'd,
join all together to vindicate this
Undertaking, and to show not the Useful∣ness
only, but the Necessity of it.</P>
<P>IT is almost thirty Years since the
Author began this Piece: He has all that
Time heard, with a just Concern, the Com∣plaints
of good Men upon the hateful Sub∣ect.
The Grave and the Sober, the Lovers
of Virtue and of Religion, have, with
Grief, express'd themselves upon the grow∣ing
Scandal; and they have often press'd
him to finish and bring out this Reproof;
and have join'd with his Opinion of the
Justice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="5"/>
HITHERTO he has been reluctant
as to the publishing it, and partly on Ac∣count
of his Years, for it was long since
finished, and partly in hopes of Reformation;
but now, despairing of Amendment, grown
OLD, and out of the reach of Scandal,
and of all the Pretences to it; <HI>Sincerely
aiming</HI> at the Reformation of the Guilty,
and <HI>despising</HI> all unjust Reproaches from a
vitious Age, he closes his Days with this
Satyr; which he is so far from seeing Cause
to be ashamed of, that he hopes he shall
not, where he is going to, Account for
it.</P>
<P>AT least, he can Appeal to that
Judge, who he is soon to come before,
that as he has done it with an upright
Intention, for the good of Mankind, so he
has used his utmost Endeavour to perform
it, in a Manner the least liable to Re∣flection,
and, in his Judgment, the most
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
likely to answer the true End of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
the Reformation of the Crime. And with
this Satisfaction, he comfortably prays for
its Success.</P>

<HEAD>Conjugal Lewdness, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is certainly true, that Modesty
is no natural Virtue; what the
<HI>Latins</HI> call'd <HI>Pudor</HI> or <HI>Shamefaced∣ness,</HI>
is the Effect of Crime, and
is always occasioned by a Con∣sciousness
of Guilt, whether it be
actual Guilt, or intentional, Guilt of a Fact al∣ready
committed, or Guilt of a Crime resolv'd
on, 'tis much the same.</P>
<P>BEFORE <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> knew <HI>Evil</HI> as well as
<HI>Good,</HI> before they were conscious of Offence,
they went naked, and blush'd not, and 'tis most
significantly express'd, <HI>they knew not that they
were naked;</HI> they knew not that Nakedness was
a Turpitude, an Indecency, and therefore when
<HI>Adam</HI> gives that poor, foolish Excuse for hiding
himself from the Eyes of the infinite Author
of Sight, and says, <HI>because he was naked,</HI> Gen. iii.
10, 11. GOD asks him, <HI>Who told thee that thou
wast naked.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
DOUBTLESS before the Fall, Innocence was
given to Man for a Covering, and he not only
knew not that he was naked, but he really <HI>was
not naked,</HI> though he was not clothed; he knew
not how to blush at being <HI>naked,</HI> much less why.</P>
<P>THE same Innocence is the Protection of Vir∣tue
to this Day in the untaught Savages in ma∣ny
Parts of the now known World, where Na∣kedness
is no Offence on one side, no Snare, no
Incaentive on the other; but Custom being the
Judge of Decency to them, takes away all Sense
of Indecency in going uncovered, whether in
whole, or in Part. See Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> upon that
Head:
<Q><L>God-like Erect, with Native Honour clad</L>
<L>In Naked Majesty—</L>
<L>So pass'd they Naked on, nor shunn'd the Sight</L>
<L>Of GOD or Angel, for they thought no Ill.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Milton,</HI> Par. fol. 95.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>NOW the same Custom in these Northern
Parts having concurr'd with the Necessity of
the Climate on one Hand, and the Laws of
Religion on the other, to cloath and cover
the Body; the Breach of that Custom would be a
Breach of Decency, and a Breach of the Laws
both of God and Man.</P>
<P>HENCE <HI>Modesty</HI> succeeds, whether as a Virtue
in it self, or as an Appendix to Virtue, we will
not dispute; but where the Rules of Decency
are broken, a Sense of Shame comes in, with as
much Force as if all the Laws of God and Man
were broken at once.</P>
<P>IT may be true, that if Man had continued in
a State of unspotted Innocence, unshaken Vir∣tue
had been Part of it; that as his Soul
<PB N="3" REF="11"/>
had been untainted with so much as a Thought
of Crime, so no Covering had been wanted to
any Part of his Body, other than the Severities
of Climate might make necessary; but to ju∣stify
what has been done since, that I may take
Notice of the Manner, and put you in Mind
of the Authority of it too, we may observe
that as his Guilt made him <HI>naked,</HI> GOD him∣self
covered him with his own Hand, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii.
21. it is said positively, that <HI>GOD</HI> clothed them
with the Skins (we suppose) of Beasts: <HI>Unto
Adam also and to his Wife did the</HI> LORD GOD
<HI>make Coats of Skins, and clothed them.</HI> So soon
were the Creatures dedicated to the Conveni∣ence,
as well as Life of Man.</P>
<P>HENCE, tho' Nakedness in a state of Innocence
had been no Offence at that time, it is other∣wise
now; and we have the Sanction of Heaven
to enforce the Decency, as we have the Force
of the Seasons to urge the Necessity of Clo∣thing:
It were to be wish'd we had nothing to
say of the Indecency even of the Clothing, and
how we study to go naked in our very Clothes,
and that after GOD himself put them on to co∣ver
us too. <HI>But of that by it self.</HI></P>
<P>GOD having then appointed, and Nature
compelled Mankind to seek Covering, all the
Pretences for going naked on that account are
at an End; a meer Chimera, an Enthusiastick
Dream, seldom attempted but by a Sect of
Madmen, worse than Lunatick, who, heated
with a <HI>religious Phrenzy,</HI> (the worst of all Pos∣sessions)
pretend to Nakedness as the Effect of
their Innocence, at the same Time making it a
Skreen to all Manner of Lewdness and Debau∣chery.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
NATURE and Religion having thus introduc'd
Decency, the strict and religious regard paid to
that Decency is become a <HI>Virtue;</HI> essential Vir∣tue,
and is so in all the requisite Parts of <HI>Vir∣tue;</HI>
I mean, those which are understood as com∣manded
by the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>GOD,</HI> or by the <HI>Laws
of NATURE;</HI> and this is MODESTY, as
it is the Subject of our present Discourse.</P>
<P>WE say that Modesty is the guard of Virtue;
and in some respects it is so; and were Modesty
universal, Virtue would need no other Defence.
But as the World now stands, she is fain to fly
to other Succours, such as Laws of Men, the
Command of Religion, the Power of Reason,
and, at last, the Protection of Governours; so
hard is she pursued by Vice and the degenerate
Passions of Men.</P>
<P>MODESTY then, as I am to understand it
here, and to discourse about it, is nothing but a
strict regard to Decency, as Decency is a strict
regard to Virtue, and Virtue is a strict regard
to Religion; indeed they seem all, in some
Sense, to be synonimous, and to mean the same
thing. It is true, Honour and Virtue may
(speaking strictly) be said in some Cases to be
preserved, though Decency is not so much, or
equally regarded: But let all that plead the
possibility of that Distinction <HI>know,</HI> that how∣ever
possible it may be, it is so far from being
probable (that where Decency is given up Ho∣nour
should or can be preserved) that they will
find it very hard to have it be believed; as they
that give up their Modesty cannot be said to
preserve Decency, so they that give up Decency
will be hardly believed to preserve their Vir∣tue.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13"/>
HENCE <HI>Modesty</HI> is become a <HI>Virtue</HI> in it self,
and, if it be not literally and expressly all that
is understood by the Word Virtue, 'tis Virtue's
compleat Representative, its true Image, and
they are as inseparable as the Gold and the
Glistering.</P>
<P>THE Object of Modesty respects three
Things.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Modesty in Discourse.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Modesty in Behaviour.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Modesty in regard to Sexes.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. BY <HI>Modesty in Discourse</HI> I think I must of
Necessity be understood, a Decency of Expres∣sion;
particularly, as our Discourse relates to A∣ctions
or Things (whether necessary or acciden∣tal)
that are and ought to be Matters of Secresy,
Things which are to be spoken of with reserve,
and in Terms that may give no offence to the
chaste Ears and Minds of others, and yet per∣haps
are of Necessity to be spoken to. Indeed
such Things, with respect to Decency, ought
never to be spoken of at all, but when Neces∣sity
urges; and it were to be wished, that in a
Christian and Modest Nation, where the Laws
of Decency are expressly admitted as Rules of
Life, all immodest Discourses were decry'd by
universal Custom; and especially that Printing
and Publishing such Things as are not to be
read with the like Decency, were effectually
suppress'd. But as I have made that Subject a
Part of this Work, I say no more of it here.</P>
<P>2. BY <HI>Modesty in Behaviour,</HI> I understand that
which we call Decorum, Distance and Defe∣rence
in Conversation, chiefly as it respects
the Distinction of Qualities in the Persons
<PB N="6" REF="14"/>
conversing; but that Part is not at all con∣cerned
in this Discourse, our present Design
looking quite another way.</P>
<P>THE last of these, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>Modesty with respect
to Sexes,</HI> is the Subject intended in this Tract,
especially as it is confined to this one Branch of
it, namely, the Conjugal Part of Life; the Inter∣course
between the Sexes, or the freedom of con∣versing
between a Man and his Wife; in which
many think all the Rules and Laws of Modesty
are finished and at an end; a Mistake so gross,
so full of fatal Mischiefs to the Publick Vir∣tue,
and to the intent and meaning of Decency
in general, that it is much in a Nation so every
way Virtuous as this, and where the Rules of
Virtue are enforced by wholesome Laws, such a
corrupt Notion should spread so far, and so
many Absurdities break out into Practice upon
that Subject.</P>
<P>THE Notion is, that there is no more such a
Thing as <HI>Modesty</HI> to be named between a Man
and his Wife; that as they are but one Flesh,
and indeed but one Body, there's no Nakedness
between them: That were they alone Covering
would be not only needless but Nonsence, if
the Climate did not require it; that nothing
can be indecent, nothing improper; that there's
no Restraint, and that no Law can be broken
by them, but every thing is Handsome, every
thing Honest, and every thing Modest; that
'tis a full Answer to all Reproach in any Case
that may be charg'd, to say it was my own Wife;
or it was none but my own Husband; this is
made the Covering to all manner of surfeiting
Indecencies and Excesses; of which I am to
speak at large in their Order.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="15"/>
IT is high time to combat this Error of Life,
and the more, because it is grown up to a
heighth not only scandalous, but criminal and
offensive, and, in some things, unnatural; and
still the more, because 'tis a Mistake that is
encreasing, and 'tis fear'd may go higher, till
at last it may break out into yet greater Abo∣minations.</P>
<P>THE
Difficulty before me is, to know how to
reprove with Decency offences against Decency;
how to expose Modestly Things which 'tis hard∣ly
Modest so much as to mention, and which
must require abundance of clean Linnen to
wrap them up in; how to speak of nauseous
and offensive Things, in Terms which shall not
give offence, and scourge immodest Actions with
an unblameable Modesty; that is, without run∣ning
out into Expressions which shall offend the
modest Ears of those that read them; this, I
say, is the only Difficulty.</P>
<P>I am insulted already on this Head by the
rude and self-guilty World; my very Title
and the bare advertising my Book, <HI>they say,</HI> is a
Breach upon Modesty, and it offends their Ears
even before it is published. They not only tell
me it will be an Obscene and immodest Book,
but that it is impossible it should be otherwise:
They say, I may pretend to as much reserved∣ness
and darkness of Expression as I please, and
may skulk behind a Croud, or indeed a Cloud
of Words; but my meaning will be reach'd,
and the lewd Age will make plain <HI>English</HI> of
it; nay, that I shall make plain <HI>English</HI> of it my
self, before I have gone half thro' the Work.</P>
<P>OTHERS, armed with the same ill Nature,
have their Tongues poisoned with another kind
of Venom, and they tell me it is an immodest
<PB N="8" REF="16"/>
Subject; that as it cannot be handled decently,
and cannot be discours'd of modestly, so it is
not intended to be so, but that 'tis a meer Bait
to the Curiosity of that Part of the reading
World, whose Vices are prompted as much by a
pretended reproving them as by the plainest
Expressions: That it forms the same Ideas in their
Minds, and they receive the Notions of Vice
in as lively a form by the very Methods tak∣en
to expose and condemn the Facts, as if
those Facts were represented to the Opticks
in all their shameless Nudities, with the
most vitious and corrupt Dress that could be
put upon them on a Stage, or in a Masque∣rade.</P>
<P>I
shall answer these People best by a Silence
in my Introduction, and a speaking Perfor∣mance.
It is my Business to let them see they
are mistaken, and that a truly modest Design
may be pursued with the utmost Decency, even
in treating of a Subject, in which all the vilest
Breaches made upon Decency by a wicked
and hitherto unreproved Behaviour are to be
censured and exposed: As to a vicious Mind
forming corrupt Ideas from the most modest
Expressions, I have only this to say; The
Crime of that Part is wholly their own, I am
no way concerned in it: The healing fructifying
Dews, and the gentle sweet refreshing Showers,
which are God's Blessing upon the Earth, when
they fall into the Sea are all turned Salt as the
Ocean, ting'd with the gross Particles of Salt
which the Sea-Water is so full of. The same
warm cherishing Beams of the Sun which raise
those sweet Dews from the Earth, shining upon
the stagnate Waters of an unwholsome Lake or
Marsh, or upon a corrupted Jakes or Dunghill,
<PB N="9" REF="17"/>
exhale noxious Vapours and Poisons, which
infect the Air, breeding Contagion and Dis∣eases
in those that breathe in it. But the Fault
is not in the Showers of refreshing Rain, or in
the wholesome Beams of the Sun, but in the
Salt, and in the Filth and Corruption of the
Places where they fall. And thus it shall be
here; Words modestly expressed can give no
immodest Ideas, where the Minds of those
that read are chaste and uncorrupted. But if a
vicious Mind hears the Vice reproved, and
forms pleasing Ideas of the Crime, without tak∣ing
notice of the just Reproof, the fault is in
the Depravity of the Mind, not in the needful
and just Reprover. I shall therefore take no no∣tice
of that Suggestion, as what I think does
not deserve the least Regard, but go on to a
just Censure of the Crime, in such a manner, as,
I hope, shall neither lessen the Reproof, or ex∣pose
the Reprover.</P>
<P>IN order to this, I may indeed lie under some
Restraints, be confined to a narrow Compass of
Words, and the Story may want in some Places
the Illustration of apposite Similies, useful Ar∣guments,
and, above all, of flagrant Examples, to
set off and set home the Arguments that are
made use of; and this, to the great Loss of the
Author, in taking away those Ornaments of his
Discourse; but where it cannot be otherwise
the Reader must be content to abate it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I pretend to say, you will not find
it a dry, a dull, or a barren Subject, for all that;
and though something may be lost, and much
left out, to preserve the Rules of Modesty,
which I could not reprove the Breaches of with
Justice, if the Work was Criminal it self, yet
I doubt not to find you Subject of Diversion
<PB N="10" REF="18"/>
enough, mixed with the Gravity of the Story,
so as, I hope, not to tire you with the Reading;
at the same time preserving the Chastity
of the Subject, the Authority of a Reprover,
and binding my self down with all possi∣ble
Severity to the Laws of Decency, Mo∣desty
and Virtue, which I write in the De∣fence
of.</P>
<P>BUT now, while I am making these Provi∣so's,
pray let me be understood too with that
just and necessary Liberty of Speech which
shall render my Discourse intelligible. I am
neither going to write in an unknown Tongue,
nor in an unintelligible Stile; I am to speak
so as to be understood, and I will not doubt
but I shall be understood; and those whose vi∣tious
Appetites are under Government, so as to
give them leave to relish decent Reproof for
indecent Things, may understand me without
large Explications, especially on Occasions where
they know the Cases will not bear it.</P>
<P>THE Scripture is the Pattern of Decency,
and, (as the learned Annotator Mr. <HI>Pool,</HI> in his
<HI>Synopsis Criticorum,</HI> and in his Annotations also
observes) speaks of all the Indecencies of Men
with the utmost Modesty; yet neither does the
Scripture forbear to command Virtue, gives
Laws and Rules of Chastity and modest Beha∣viour,
and that in very many Places, and on
all needful Occasions: Nor does the Scripture
fail to reprove the Breach of those Laws in
the most vehement manner, condemning the
Facts, and censuring and judging the guilty
Persons with the utmost Rigour and Severity,
as I shall on many Occasions be led to observe
as I go on. Let none therefore flatter them∣selves
that their Crimes shall avoid the Lash
<PB N="11" REF="19"/>
of a just Satyr in this Work, for want of Ex∣pressions
suited to the Nature of the Reproof,
and the Vileness of the Offence. We shall find
Words to expose them, without giving a Blow
to Decency in the Reproof; we shall find Ways
and Means to dress up surfeiting Crimes in
softening Language; so that none but the
Guilty need to blush, none but the Criminals
be offended.</P>
<P>BUT the Crime must be reproved; there's a
Necessity for the Reproof as there is a Necessity
of a Cure in a violent Distemper. Do we
reckon it a Breach of Modesty for the Body to
be exposed in Anatomies, and published with
learned Lectures on every Part by the Anato∣mists?
Are not the vilest and most unnatural
of all Crimes necessarily brought before Courts
of Justice, that the Criminals may be punished
as they deserve? And though it may be true,
that sometimes judicial Proceedings are not ma∣naged
with such Decency in those Cases as
others think they might, and which, however,
I allow to be sometimes unavoidable; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not∣withstanding
all that can be pretended of Im∣modesty
in those Proceedings, the Punishment
of the Criminal, or his being sentenced must not
be omitted, for the preserving the Modesty of
the Trial; an Offender would come well off in
many Offences, besides this I am treating of,
if he must not be brought to Justice, because
the very mention of his Crime would put
criminal Ideas into the minds of those that
hear of it.</P>
<P>LET it suffice then in the Case before us; I
am entring upon a just and needful Censure of
preposterous and immodest Actions; I shall per∣form
it in as decent and reserved Terms as I am
<PB N="12" REF="20"/>
able to do, and as a Man meaning to correct,
not encourage, Vice is able to do. If a lewd
Fancy will entertain it self with the meer Ideas
of Crime, where it is only with the utmost Seve∣rity
condemned, Be the Crime to the Criminal,
I see no reason to be afraid of doing Justice on
that Account. A Man is to be executed for
Sodomy; Nature and the Laws of God require
it; Must not the Criminal die because all that
see or hear of it must immediately form Ideas
of the Crime in their Thoughts, nay, and per∣haps
may think criminally of it? This would
give a loose to Wickedness indeed, and Men
might Sin with most Freedom where their
Crimes were too vile to be punished, because
they were too gross to be named.</P>
<L>So when a Cloud its hasty Show'rs sends down,</L>
<L>They're meant to fructify and not to drown;</L>
<L>And in a Torrent if a Drunkard sink,</L>
<L>'Tis not the Flood that drowns him but the Drink.</L>
<L>But 'twould be hard because a Sinner's slain,</L>
<L>For fear of Drowning we should have no Rain.</L>
<P>BESIDES, it wou'd be a light escape; and some
of our first Readers would triumph another
way over the Author, if they could be satisfied
that they had sinned in a manner so gross that
he could not find Words to reprove them in;
I mean, such Words as were fit for modest Ears
to bear the hearing of. Our well known Friend
<HI>G—A—,</HI> with his three Brether, (as they
call them in the North) who think themselves
beyond the reach of Reproof, as they are out of
the reach of Conscience, may find themselves
mistaken here; and that if they will venture
<PB N="13" REF="21"/>
for once to think and look in, they may see
themselves touch'd to the quick, and yet the
Readers hardly able to guess at their Crime,
and not at all at their Persons; which last they
ought to acknowledge is a special Favour to
them, whether they deserve it or no.</P>
<P>SO kind have I been to their Fame, and so
careful to leave Room for their Amendment,
which I would hope for in spite of their solemn
Vows to the contrary.</P>
<P>NOR shall that eminent Brute of Quality pass
untouched here, whose Name or Titles need
no other mention than what are to be summ'd
up in this short Character:
<Q><L>A Life of Crime, with this peculiar Fame,</L>
<L>Without Sense of Guilt, and past Sense of
Shame.</L></Q></P>
<P>I say, he shall see his most inimitable Way
of Sinning stabbed to the Heart, and damn'd
with an unanswerable and unexceptionable
Reproof; and yet without any Description ei∣ther
of his Person or his Offence, other than as
may be Read by himself, and those that know
him; though I must allow him to be the weak∣est
and the wickedest Thing alive; vain of be∣ing
the first in a Crime, and the last that will
leave it; that blushes at nothing but the thoughts
of Blushing, and thinks a Man of Wit can be
ashamed of nothing but Repentance; That Sins
for the sake of Crime without the pleasure of
it, and is got seven Degrees in Sin beyond the
<HI>Devil,</HI> in that he not only boasts of Sins which
he never committed, but tells the World he
FIBS, by boasting of Sins, which all the Town
knows he cannot commit.</P>
<Q><PB N="14" REF="22"/>
<L>If such a Wretch on Earth ye Gods there be,</L>
<L>I'll die if our Sir—be not he.</L></Q>
<P>NOR let another flagrant Example of married
Lewdness trouble himself, or express his Con∣cern,
least he should be omitted in this Work
for fear of our offending the chast Ears of our
Readers with his vile Story.</P>
<Q>A City Sinner, nameless as his Crime.</Q>
<P>Let him not doubt but he may find himself
suitably reproved, seeing he is so fond of it;
and since he desires the Fame of being superla∣tively
Wicked, he may hear of it in a manner
that shall make others blush for him, though he
can't blush for himself.</P>
<P>BUT to pass these and some more, for in this
Age of preposterous Crime we should never
find our Way out, should we enter into the
Labyrinth of Characters, and bring on Regi∣ments
of Examples. Our present Business is
with the Offence not with the Offenders, with
the Crimes not the Criminals; if a just Satyr on
the wicked Part will not reclaim us, I doubt the
List of the Guilty of both Sexes, though it
would indeed be as numerous as our City train'd
Bands; would be as useless a Muster as that at
the Artillery Ground, and find as little Refor∣mation
among them.</P>
<P>AS it is in ordinary Crimes, that Men Sin on
because they scorn and are ashamed to Repent,
so in the Case before me, when they are
launched into the most flagrant of all Crimes,
things so odious that 'tis offensive to modest
Ears so much as to hear of them, and difficult
<PB N="15" REF="23"/>
to a modest Pen so much as to write of them;
they take hold of the hellish Advantage, and
make the greatness, the superlative Blackness of
their Offences be their Protection in the com∣mitting
them; as if they were out of the reach
of Reproof, because no modest Pen can dip
in the Dirt, or rake in the Dunghil of their
Vices, without being sullied and daub'd by
them; that it would be scandalous for any mo∣dest
Man so much as to mention what they do
not think it scandalous to do. Thus the har∣dened
and fearless <HI>A</HI>—<HI>C</HI>—, who
defies God and Man, laughs at Reproach, and
threatens every Reprover, impudently said to
his Parish Minister that modestly spoke of his
Crimes, “<HI>You may talk to me here, Doctor,</HI> at
home, <HI>but you dare not speak a Word of it in
the Pulpit; I am out of your reach there; Why,
all the Women would run out of the Church, and
they'd throw Stones at you as you go along the
Street if you did but mention it.”</HI></P>
<P>HAPPY Criminal! that hugs himself in being
too Vile to be reproved, or so much as modest∣ly
mentioned; that his Crimes cannot be ex∣posed
because modest Ears cannot bear to
hear them spoken of. Let the Offender, who
is fam'd for being Revengeful, and who is not
so far off as not to hear of it, resent it if he
thinks fit: I am told he will soon hear more of
it, where it may be spoken of without fear
of his Anger.</P>
<P>THIS very Case runs parallel with what I
am now engaged in; but the Age shall see the
Effect shall not answer their End. Shall it be
Criminal to reprove the Offence which they
think it is not Criminal to commit? Must we
Blush to speak of what they will not Blush to
<PB N="16" REF="24"/>
do? And must the most detestable Things go on
in practice, because we dare not go on to cry
them down? God forbid we should by Silence
seem to approve that Wickedness, while that Si∣lence
is occasioned only because the Wickedness
is too gross to be reproved.</P>
<P>SURE our Language is not so barren of Words
as that we cannot find out proper Expressions
to reprehend an impudent Generation, with∣out
Breach of Decency in the Diction; or
that immodest Actions may not be modestly
exposed.</P>
<P>IF corrupt Imaginations will rise up, and
Men will please themselves with the Difficulty
I am put to for Words; if they will turn my most
reserved Terms into lewd and vitious Ideas, and
debauch their Thoughts while I expose their
Debaucheries, let them go on their own Way;
let them think as wickedly as they please, they
shall owe it to themselves, not to me; both
the Fire and the Tinder are all their own.
Here shall be no Materials to work upon, no
Combustibles to kindle, but what they bring
with them.</P>
<P>BUT the Work must be done in spite of the
Difficulty. Shall they watch for a slip of my
Pen, and take Advantage, if possible, from any
misplaced Word, to reprove me of Indecency
in the necessary Work of reproving their
shameless Immodesty? Must I be ashamed to
expose the Crime which they are not ashamed
to be guilty of, and blush to mention the
Things they boast of Doing? The Truth is, I
know not why I should not freely name the
Men, who in the open Coffee-houses, and in
their common wicked Discourses, publickly
brag of the most immodest and shameless Be∣haviour,
<PB N="17" REF="25"/>
and vilely name themselves to be
guilty of it, make sport of the Crimes, and
value themselves in being the Criminals; but
it shall not be long before I may speak of it
much plainer.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, as the Offence is flagrant, is grown
scandalous and notorious, and that we find the
Age ripening up by it to the highest and most
unnatural of all Crimes, to the shame of Soci∣ety,
and to the scandal even of the Protestant
Profession; I have undertaken to begin the War
against it as a Vice, and hope to make good
the Charge, though I know I do make the At∣tempt
at the risque of all that a modest Writer
has to hazard.</P>
<P>HE that undertakes a Satyr against an uni∣versal
Custom, shall be sure to raise upon him∣self
an universal Clamour; my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI>
is plain in that Case:
<Q><L>“Nor shall weak Truth your Reputation save,</L>
<L>The Knaves will all agree to call you Knave.”</L></Q></P>
<P>IT must be acknowledged the Age is ripened
up in Crime to a dreadful heighth, and it is
not a light, a gentle Touch, that will bring
them to blush. The Learned and Reverend Mi∣nisters,
the Good, the Pious, who would re∣prove
them, are forced to content themselves to
sit still, and pray for them; and, as the Scripture
says, <HI>to mourn in Secret for their Abominations;</HI>
they cannot foul their solemn Discourses with
the Crimes which they have to Combat with;
the Pulpit is sacred to the venerable Office of a
Preacher of GOD's Word; and the Gravity
of the Place, a decent Regard to the Work,
and especially to the Assembly, forbids them pol∣luting
<PB N="18" REF="26"/>
their Mouths with the filthy Behaviour
of those they see Cause to reprove: And this
makes many a lewd and vitious Wretch go
unexposed, at least as he deserves; and many a
scandalous Crime, as well as the rich and pow∣erful
Criminals, go unreproved.</P>
<P>THE auxiliary Press therefore must come in
to supply the deficiency; they may read, I
hope, what they could not hear: Nor am I
afraid of the Faces of Men, that, eminent in
Wickedness, flagrant in Lewdness, and abomi∣nable
in Tongue, as well as Practice, the famous
and infamous in the worst of Vices, Sir—
<HI>P</HI>—, shall here see himself marked out
for his odious Behaviour, in defiance of his
Quality or Power. He who by Office and
Authority punishes every Day less Crimes
than he commits, who sins out of the reach of
Reproof from the Pulpit, because too vile (as
well as too powerful) to be spoken of by a mo∣dest
Divine, who perhaps thinks it his Duty
rather to Pray for him, which he laughs at,
than to Reprove him, which he would storm
and swear at; I say, he shall find what was said
in another Case:
<Q><L>The Press may reach him, who the Pulpit scorns,</L>
<L>And he whose flagrant Vice the B—adorns:</L>
<L>The fearless Satyr shall to Rage give vent,</L>
<L>And teach him how to Blush, tho' not Repent.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN short, 'tis a strange World! and we are
grown up to a strange heighth in our Notions
of Things! we have brought our selves to a Con∣dition
very particular to the Day, and singular
as I may say, to our selves; the Policy of our
<PB N="19" REF="27"/>
Vices has got the better of Virtue, and the
Criminals have managed themselves so artfully,
that, it seems, they may Sin with less hazard
of Reputation, than the Innocent may reprove
them: For Example,</P>
<P>THE Crime is now less Scandal than Repen∣tance,
and, as the Proverb says, 'tis a shame to
Steal, but 'tis a double shame to carry Home
again; so 'tis a shame to Sin, but 'tis a double
shame to Repent; nay, we go beyond all that,
'tis no shame to be Wicked, but to Whine and
Repent is intolerable; and, as the late Colonel
<HI>H</HI>—said, in the flagrance of his Wit, that
it might be a Fault to Whore, and Drink, and
Swear, and some worse Sins of his, which he
reckoned up; but to Repent! to Repent! <HI>says
he,</HI> (repeating the Words) nothing of a Gentle∣man
can come into that; to be Wicked, adds
he, is wicked, that's true; but to Repent, that's
the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<Q>“Blush to Repent, but never blush to Sin.”</Q>
<P>BUT the <HI>Rubicon</HI>'s past, it must be put to the
venture; and let Rage and exasperated Lust
do its worst, the lewd Age shall hear their
shameless Behaviour as well exposed as it will
bear, and that withont any shameless Doings in
the Reproof; they will find no Levity here;
no cleansing Blurs with blotted Fingers; they
shall have nothing to Blush for but that they
give occasion for such a Reproof, which being
engaged with them on the occasion of their
filthy Conduct, may be forced to speak of it in
Terms necessary to express our detestation of
it, but not at all adapted to encourage or recom∣mend
it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">of MATRIMONY, the Nature of it, its
sacred Original, and the true intent and
meaning of its Institution; as also how
our Notions of it are degenerated, the
Obligations of it disregarded, and the
Thing it self, as a State of Life, grosly
abused.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>EING to discourse in a particular
and extraordinary Manner of the
Breaches of the Matrimonial Rela∣tion,
with the Disorders which are
committed under the Protection of
Matrimony; and being to exhibit a Charge of
very high Crimes and Misdemeanors against some
People who think themselves very Virtuous and
Modest, and yet give themselves all those Ma∣trimonial
Liberties: It is highly needful to ex∣plain
to such seemingly Ignosant, what the true
intent and meaning of that ill-understood State
of Life is; what it imports; and how Christians
ought to rate and esteem the Obligation of it in
the Conduct of a regular Life.</P>
<P>FOR as I find my Judgment of Things is
like to differ from others, that what they think
lawful I shall condemn as criminal, and censure
what they think moderate and sober, the Pre∣liminaries
ought to be settled as we go; that
we may begin upon right Principles, lea∣ving
<PB N="21" REF="29"/>
no Room to cavil at Terms, and dispute
upon Construction of Words, nicety of Expres∣sion,
double <HI>Entendres,</HI> and such Trifles. I re∣solve
to speak plainly, and would be under∣stood
distinctly.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is, according to the Words in
the Office appointed in our Liturgy, <HI>GOD's Or∣dinance,</HI>
that I shall prove to you presently; but
'tis moreover <HI>GOD's holy Ordinance.</HI> Now if it
be a holy Ordinance, the married Life has a Sanc∣tion
too, and ought to be preserved sacred, not be
debauched with criminal Excesses of any kind;
much less should it be made a cover and skreen for
those matrimonial Intemperances which I now
speak of, and which I shall prove to be not on∣ly
scandalous to, but unworthy of Matrimony,
as a sacred state of Life.</P>
<P>AS it is GOD's Ordinance, and an holy Or∣dinance,
so 'tis an honourable State; the Apo∣stle
says, <HI>Marriage is honourable, Heb.</HI> xiii. 4.
But then you are to observe also, that it is
immediately added, and the <HI>Bed undefiled.</HI> Now
this nice Term of the Bed undefiled, requires
some Explanation, and in that perhaps we may
differ. They that think the Marriage-Bed can∣not
be defiled but by <HI>Adultery,</HI> will greatly dif∣fer
from me; and 'tis my Business to prove they
are mistaken, which, if I do not, I do no∣thing.</P>
<P>BUT,
that I may do it with the more clear∣ness,
and leave no Room for Dispute, I there∣fore
set apart this first Chapter to consider Ma∣trimony
in general, what it is, how we ought
to understand it, and what the End and Design
of GOD's Appointment in it was, and still is;
and by this, I think, I may make Way for a
more exact Observation of those Duties which
<PB N="22" REF="30"/>
the matrimonial Vow is said to bind us to, and
expose the scandalous Mistakes of those who
make it a Cloke to all Licentiousness.</P>
<P>AS soon as our Mother <HI>EVE</HI> was first form'd,
had just found her self in Being, and though
she had seen nothing about her, yet had a Soul
as capacious of Knowledge as the Man she was
made for. The Text says, GOD <HI>brought her to
the Man,</HI> Gen. ii. 22. that is, in short, <HI>GOD mar∣ried
them. Adam</HI> himself expresses it, cap. iii.
12. <HI>The Woman whom thou gavest me. N. B.</HI> GOD
gave the Bride.</P>
<P>HENCE I observe by the way, tho' with all
possible Brevity, that they are certainly wrong
who challenge the Clergy for engrossing the
Office of Marrying, as if it did not belong to
them, but was a meer Civil Contract, and
therefore was no Perquisite of the Church, but
the Business of the Magistrate.</P>
<P>I say, '<HI>tis a Mistake;</HI> for as it was instituted
immediately from the divine Authority, so it was
solemnized by him who having alone Instituted
it, had a Right to perform the Ceremony; for
this Reason it is called <HI>GOD's holy Ordinance;</HI>
and though I do not think it ought to be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
a <HI>Sacrament,</HI> yet without doubt GOD himself
put a sacred Character upon it as he honoured
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="23" REF="31"/>
Authority. The Ceremony then being truly
Religious, and an Ordinance of GOD, it goes
with GOD's other Ordinances, away to the
Priest, whose Business it is to exercise all reli∣gious
Offices; and this among the rest.</P>
<P>ALSO here, if you will allow me to Preach,
it shall be against the Plurality of Wives:
From this Pattern in Paradise <HI>Poligamy</HI> seems to
be utterly condemned; and though in the Times
of After-Ignorance many Things were prac∣tised,
which, as the Text says, <HI>GOD winked at,</HI>
yet in the Beginning it was not so; and we may
as well Argue for marrying two Sisters, as <HI>Ja∣cob,</HI>
and perhaps several others did, till it was
especially prohibited, as for marrying many
Wives at once, which 'tis evident our Saviour
forbids, and the Argument against them are
alike, as I said above, (<HI>viz.</HI>) <HI>That in the Begin∣ning
it was not so.</HI></P>
<P>I know 'tis alledged, that the encrease of
Mankind, in those early Ages of Time, made
it necessary; but might it not be much more a
Reason in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Case when he was alone?
And why did not GOD, for the immediate
Propagation of the kind, and encrease of the
World, make his Rib into half a dozen Wives
for <HI>Adam,</HI> or as many as he had pleas'd.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis evident, one Wife to one Husband
was thought best by his Maker, who knew
what was best, and most calculated for his tem∣poral
Felicity; as to the encrease of People,
'twas evident the Race soon multiplied; and,
after the Interruption of the first Growth, and
the Disaster of <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death, the long Life of
the Antediluvians also considered, the Numbers
of People soon encreased, and that in a prodigious
manner; for, if you will believe the learned

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
Author of the <HI>Theory of the Earth,</HI> 'tis proba∣ble
there were much greater Numbers of People
alive at the Deluge than ever were in the
World at any one time since, or than are now;
tho' the World is thought to be more populous
now than ever it has been since the Deluge.</P>
<P>THE Argument for the encrease of People
could not be greater since, than it was in Para∣dise;
and had GOD approved of it, or thought
it reasonable, he would certainly have given
<HI>Adam</HI> more Wives than one at first. Besides,
one Wife was given him as a <HI>Help meet;</HI> by
which it is evident the Original understands it
a Help sufficient to him, intimating, that they
were in every Thing sufficient to one another;
and not to enter into that Part of it which re∣spect
their Sexes, which my lewder Readers will
perhaps look for; 'Tis evident, that a single
handed Matrimony is many Ways adapted to
the Felicity of human Life more than a state
of Poligamy; the Effect of a Plurality of
Wives having always been Family-Strife, En∣vying,
and Quarrelling, between the Women
especially, no Part of which could much add
to the Felicity of the Husband, and often did
embark the Husband in the Breach, as in the
Examples of <HI>Sarah</HI> and <HI>Hagar, Leah</HI> and <HI>Rachel,
Hannah</HI> and <HI>Penninah,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, we see the most eminent
of the Patriarchs had but one Wife, at least we
read of no more; even <HI>Abraham,</HI> except in the
Case of <HI>Hagar,</HI> who was but a Concubine at
most, had but one Wife at a Time; <HI>Isaac</HI> had
never any but <HI>Rebecca, Joseph, Moses, Aaron,</HI>
and several others; the grosser Use of Wo∣men
came in with <HI>David,</HI> as the setting up a
Seraglio of Whores did with King <HI>Solomon;</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="37"/>
but, to repeat our Saviour's Words again, in
the Beginning it was not so.</P>
<P>BUT I shall speak of that Part again in its
Course. What I have now said is but a Di∣gression
made necessary as an Observation on
the manner of the first Wedding; the Man and
the Woman, as I have said, were single and se∣parate,
but GOD made them to associate toge∣ther,
so he <HI>brought the Woman to him,</HI> and gave
her to be with him, that is, as above, <HI>GOD
married them.</HI></P>
<P>GOD having thus ordained Matrimony, and
solemnized the first Nuptials in Paradise, it
cannot be denied to be, as our Office of Matri∣mony
declares it, <HI>GOD's holy Ordinance.</HI> How
our Notions of it are degenerated, the Bonds of
it disregarded, and the whole Institution abu∣sed,
is the Subject of this whole Undertaking,
but especially of this Chapter.</P>
<P>WHAT the true intent and meaning of Ma∣trimony,
in its first Institution, was, and what
the Nature of that Contract points at, I shall
leave in better Hands; the learned Fathers of
the Church have, in all Ages, taken Pains to
explain those Things to you: Nor am I going
about to Preach, as a Reverend Divine lately
did to the surprize of his Auditory, on <HI>Gen.</HI> iv.
ver. 1. <HI>Adam knew his Wife Eve.</HI> But there are
a great many Civil Views in the Institution of
Matrimony, which the propagating of the kind
has little or no Concern in, and the Ordinance
of Matrimony suffers as much by our scanda∣lous
Notions of it, <HI>as a State of Life,</HI> as it does
in any other Part.</P>
<P>NOR is the subordination any Part of the Case
I am upon; I am so little a Friend to that
which they call Government and Obedience
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>
between the Man and his Wife, especially as
some People would have it be understood, and
as the common Talk is managed when such
Things come in our way; that the Ladies will
take no Offence at me, I dare say. I don't
take the State of Matrimony to be designed as
that of Apprentices who are bound to the Family,
and that the Wife is to be us'd only as the up∣per
Servant in the House. The great Duty be∣tween
the Man and his Wife, I take to consist
in that of Love, in the Government of Af∣fection,
and the Obedience of a complaisant,
kind, obliging Temper; the Obligation is reci∣procal,
'tis drawing in an equal Yoke; Love
knows no superior or inferior, no imperious
Command on one hand, no reluctant Subjection
on the other; the End of both should be the
well-ordering their Family, the good-guiding
their Houshold and Children, educating, in∣structing
and managing them with a mutual
Endeavour, and giving respectively good Ex∣amples
to them, directing others in their Duty
by doing their own well, guiding themselves
in every Relation, in order to the well guiding
all that are under them; filling up Life with
an equal Regard to those above them, and
those below them, so as to be Exemplar to
all.</P>
<P>THIS is Matrimony in its just appointed
meaning, whatever Notions our fashionable
People may have of it. What Import else can
those Words have in them, which we find so
carefully placed, and so openly repeated in the
Office at the Time of Marriage, <HI>Wilt thou love
her, live with her, comfort her, honour, keep her,</HI>
and again, <HI>to love and to cherish,</HI> and afterward
'tis added, that you will do all this <HI>according
<PB N="27" REF="39"/>
to GOD's holy Ordinance;</HI> which, if I may ex∣pound
in very plain Words, is, according to
the true intent and meaning of the first Insti∣tution,
and that is in the Sense of GOD him∣self,
to be a <HI>Help meet</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, the Matrimonial Duty is
all reciprocal; 'tis founded in Love, 'tis per∣formed
in the heighth of Affection; its most
perfect Accomplishment consists not in the
Union of the Sexes, but in the Union of the
Souls; uniting their Desires, their Ends, and
consequently their Endeavours, for compleating
their mutual Felicity.</P>
<P>ALL the subjection and subordination in the
World, without this mutual Affection, cannot
give one Dram of Satisfaction or Enjoyment.
How remote our Notions of Marriage in ge∣neral
are to these Things, and how little the
present Age seems to understand them, or at
least to regard them, I need not enquire; 'tis
too visible in almost every Family: Nor indeed
can it be otherwise, except by some rare Exam∣ple
of Virtue and good Humour meeting on
both Sides, which, as Marriages are now made,
is very unlikely to happen; 'tis a Lottery of a
thousand Blanks to a Prize.</P>
<P>NOT one in five hundred of those that now
marry, really understand what they marry for;
I cannot give the detail of their general Ac∣count,
and of the Answers they would give to
the Question without Blushes, not <HI>at them,</HI> but
<HI>for them;</HI> I do not mean Blushing in the Sense
that I generally take the Word in this Book,
but I mean blushing for the Folly and Igno∣rance
of the People.</P>
<P>ASK the Ladies why they marry, they tell
you 'tis for a good Settlement; tho' they had
<PB N="28" REF="40"/>
their own Fortunes to settle on themselves be∣fore.
Ask the Men why they marry, it is for
the Money. How few Matches have any other
Motive except such as I must mention here∣after,
and indeed will hardly bear any mention
at all, for many known Reasons. How little is
regarded of that one essential and absolutely ne∣cessary
Part of the Composition, called Love,
without which the matrimonial State is, I
think, hardly lawful, I am sure is not rational,
and, I think, can never be happy.</P>
<P>HENCE it follows, that we have such few
happy and successful Matches. How much Ma∣trimony,
how little Love; how many Coupled,
how few Join'd; in a word, how much Mar∣riage,
how little Friendship. O Friendship!
thou exalted Felicity of Life, thou glorious
Incorporation of Souls, thou heavenly Image,
thou polisher and finisher of the brightest Part
of Mankind, how much art thou talked of,
how little understood, how much pretended to,
how little endeavoured for! Where does the
kind expecting Husband find a sincere Friend
in his Bosom? How seldom does the tender af∣fectionate
Wife take a Friend into her Arms,
even though she does take the Person, she takes
the Man without the Husband, and the Hus∣band
without the Friend? Not Virtue, not
Fidelity to the Marriage Bed, not Conscience
of the Conjugal Duty, not Religion, will do
it; <HI>no not RELIGION!</HI> How many Hus∣bands
and Wives will go to Heaven from the
Arms of the Wives and Husbands they had no
Friendship for?</P>
<P>HOW miserably do the Pious and the Devout,
the Religious and the Consciencious live toge∣ther!
the Husbands here, the Wives there, by
<PB N="29" REF="41"/>
jarring Tempers, discording Affections, and, in
short, meer want of Love and Friendship, grow
scandals to the marry'd Life, and set themselves
up for Beacons and Light-houses, to warn the
wandering World, and to bid them beware how
they marry without Love, how they join Hands
and not Hearts, unite Interests, unite Sexes,
unite Families and Relatives, and yet never
unite Hearts?</P>
<P>HOW is Matrimony abused in all these Cases
by almost all Sorts of People, who carrying a
Face of Civility and Union in the married Life,
and who, in view of the World, pass for sober,
modest, grave, religious, and all that Virtue
and Honesty call for among Christians; and
yet trace them into their Houses and Families,
their Conversation is gross, and, in a manner
debauched with undecent Language, their Way
of living all Luxury and Sloth, their Marriage
Covenants broken by Strife and Contention;
in a word, their Houses a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and their
Marriage Bed a Scene of Lewdness and Excesses
not to be named.</P>
<P>IS this living together after GOD's holy Or∣dinance?
Is this making the Marriage Bed a
Bed undefiled? Will they pretend there is no∣thing
defiles the Marriage Bed but Whoredom,
and forsaking the Marriage Covenant. Let not
that Mistake be their Protection in the Breach
of the Laws of Nature, and despising all the
limitations of Decency and Modesty; there
are Laws and Limits plac'd by Nature, nay,
let me say, by the GOD of Nature, even to the
conjugal Embraces; and a due regard is to be
had, in all Cases, to those Laws and Limits.
If I am speaking to Christians I need not ex∣plain
my self; but as I am to speak to some
<PB N="30" REF="42"/>
People who, though the World calls them
Christians, can hardly, without blushing, call
themselves so, I must be forced to speak as
plainly as the Laws of Decency will allow, in
reproving their Conduct, I refer to the Parti∣culars
in the following Tract, where they who
are guilty may find Room to blush.</P>
<P>IT were to be wished, that all People that
marry were to be ask'd before-hand if they re∣ally
understood what Matrimony meant, and
what the true intent of a married Life was, as
well in its Institution, as in the grand Design of
Family-Felicity; the married Couple are
young, their Blood warm; the Youth, fir'd
with the blooming Beauty of his Bride, thinks
of little all the while the <HI>Apparatus</HI> of the
Wedding is in hand, nay, perhaps all the while
he is (<HI>feigning</HI>) I should say making, Love to
her, as we weakly call his Courting her, I think
we should rather call it, all the while he is
talking in Jest to her; I say, all this while he
is thinking of little but getting to Bed to her.
What engages her Thoughts I say nothing to,
for Reasons given already.</P>
<P>THUS, coming together without Thought, we
are not to wonder they go on without Conduct,
that they act a thousand weak and wild Things
afterwards, such as they often live to be ashamed
of, and to blush at. As they allowed them∣selves
to think no farther than the wedding
Week, so how awkwardly do they behave when
they come to the graver Part of Life? Matri∣mony
is not a Branch of Life only, but 'tis a
State, 'tis a settled Establishment of Life, and an
Establishment for a continuance at least of the
Life of one of the two. How unhappy are those
married People, who rashly coming together, as I
<PB N="31" REF="43"/>
said just now, and perhaps with mean and un∣thinking
Views, I think I may say, Views un∣worthy
of the Dignity and Honour of a mar∣ried
State, seem surprised and disappointed
when they come to enter upon the subsequent
more weighty and solid Part of the married
Life? How often do we hear them say, If I had
known what it had been to be a Wife, if I
had known what it had been to be a Husband,
and to have the Care of a Family upon me,
and a House-full of Children to provide for, and
take care of, I would never have married. Some
indeed Repent upon a worse Foot. But I am
speaking of it now, even where the Article of
a bad Husband or a bad Wife are not con∣cerned.</P>
<P>MARRIAGE
is an <HI>honourable State</HI> or Station
of Life, but it is not a thoughtless, idle, un∣employed
State, even where the Concerns of the
Family are easy, where Plenty flows, and the
World smiles; yet a married Life has its Cares,
its Anxieties, its Embarassments, which the
young Lady knew nothing of in her Father's
House, where she liv'd without Care, without
Disturbance, slept without Fear, and wak'd
without Sorrows. But married, she is a Mistress,
she is a Mother, she is a Wife, every one of
which Relations has its little <HI>addenda</HI> of Incum∣cumbrance,
and perhaps of Uneasiness too, be
her Circumstances as good otherwise as she can
or would suppose them to be.</P>
<P>WE have an <HI>English</HI> saying, they that marry
in haste repent at leisure. Now though my
Design is not to run down the married State,
and raise frightful Ideas in the Minds of those
that are to enter into it, so as to prevent their
marrying; yet, I hope, I may hint to them,
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
that they should look before they take this
Leap in the Dark, that they should consider all
the Circumstances that are before them, that
they may have no Reason to repent when they
shall be sure to have no Room for it.</P>
<P>NOW, it is not the Matrimony, but the abuse
of Matrimony, which is our present Subject,
nor let the Ladies be offended, as if I was per∣swading
Folks not to marry at all; it is not
refusing Matrimony that I persuade to in order
to prevent those Abuses, but a considering and
weighing the Circumstances of Matrimony be∣fore
it is consummated. I agree with the Maids
Catechise, where the first Question is, <HI>What is
the chief End of a Maid?</HI> and the Answer is,
<HI>To be married.</HI> But I am Arguing to remove
the Occasion of those Abuses which make the
Matrimony ruinous, and a Disaster both to the
Man and to the Maid.</P>
<P>THIS would secure the Affection of the Par∣ties
before they marry; they would be united
before they were joined, they would be mar∣ried
even before they were wedded, the Love
would be possess'd before the Persons, and they
would have exchanged Hearts before they ex∣changed
the Words of, I, <HI>N.</HI> take thee <HI>N;</HI> in
short, Matrimony without Love is the Cart be∣fore
the Horse, and Love without Matrimony
is the Horse without any Cart at all.</P>
<P>MARRYING is not such a frightful Thing
that we should be terrified at the Thoughts of
it, yet it is far from being such a trifling Thing
either that we should run Headlong or Blind∣fold
into it, without so much as looking before
us. 'Twas a prudent Saying of a young Lady,
who wanted neither Wit or Fortune to recom∣mend
her, that marrying on the Woman's Side
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
was like a Horse rushing into the Battle, who
depending upon the Hand that rules him, has
no Weapon of his own, either offensive or de∣fensive;
whereas, on the Man's side, like the
Soldier, he has both Armour to preserve him∣self,
and Weapons to make him be fear'd by his
Adversary.</P>
<P>I know not by what degeneracy in our Man∣ners,
or corruption of Principles, it is come
to pass, but 'tis too general in practice, that
Matrimony is now looked upon only as a po∣litick
Opportunity to gratify a vitious Appe∣tite:
The Form, how sacred soever graver Heads
may pretend it is in its Institution, is now
become our Jest, and not only ridiculed and
bantered in our Discourse, for that might be
born with, but 'tis become a Jest in practice;
all the solemn Part is dropt out of our Thoughts,
the Money and the Maidenhead is the Sub∣ject
of our Meditations; not only the divine
Institution is made a Stalking-horse to the bru∣tal
Appetite, but indeed the best of Women are
betrayed by it into the hands of the vilest of
Men, and in the grossest manner abus'd; nay,
which is still worse, this is done with a Banter
and a Jest, all the sacred Obligations, the in∣dissolvable
Bands of Religion and Virtue, are
trampled under foot; the modest and most vir∣tuous
Lady is impudently defloured, and the
Night's Enjoyment boasted of the next Day in
the Arms of a Strumpet; the innocent Bride
is poisoned with a Disease, and the detestable
Wretch is a Bridegroom, and an Adulterer, in
the first four and twenty Hours of his Engage∣ment.</P>
<P><HI>A—B—</HI> was a Gentleman of
Figure and Fortune; in his Coach and four, and
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>
with a suitable Equipage: He made his Addres∣ses
to a wealthy Citizen, and Proposals of suit∣able
Settlement, for his Consent to court his
Daughter. Nothing appeared but what was fair
and honourable; he is accepted; the young
Lady, virtuous, modest, beautiful, finely bred,
in the Bloom of her Youth, Wheedled with his
Tongue, and deceived with the appearance of
a fine Gentleman, and a Lover, yields to the
Proposals, and throws her self into the Arms of
the worst of Monsters.</P>
<P>THE very first Moments of his embraces
fright her with something inexpressibly nau∣seous
about him; yet Innocence and Virtue
had no Power to make a Judgment of Things;
but, like the chast <HI>Roman</HI> Lady, whose Hus∣band
had a stinking Breath, innocently an∣swered,
That she thought all Men were so.</P>
<P>IN short, the Lady is ruined the first Night;
the V..... boasted among his viler Com∣panions,
that he had given her something that
would soon dispose of her; and it was too true;
in less than a Month she was in a Condition
not fit to be described, in about two more the
ablest Physicians shook their Heads, and voted
her Incurable, in eight Months she was a de∣plorable
Object, and, in less than a Year, lodg'd
in her Grave; the Murtherer, for he can be no
other, putting on Black for a shew; but when
charged home by the Friends of the ruin'd
Lady, answered with a kind of a laugh, that he
thought he had been cured.</P>
<P>IF this unhappy Story were a Romance, a
Fiction, contrived to illustrate the Subject, I
should give it you with all its abhorred Particu∣lars,
as far as decency of Language would per∣mit;
that the abuse of Matrimony, which is the
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
Subject I am now to enter upon, may be expo∣sed
as it deserves.</P>
<P>BUT when Facts, however flagrant, are too
near home, and the miserable Sufferers already
too much oppressed with the Injury, we must
not add to their Afflictions by too publick a use
of the Calamity to embellish our Story; the
murthered Lady rests in her Grave; we must
leave the Offender to the supreme Justice, and
to the Reproaches of his Conscience.</P>
<P>SAD Examples of conjugal Treachery might
be given of this kind; and I might make the
whole Work a Satyr upon those, who, abusing
the Marriage Bed, have prostituted the sacred
Institution to their Vice, and made it a cover∣ing
to Crime, a snare to the Person drawn into
it, and a cheat to devour their Fortunes, as well
as Persons.</P>
<P>THE Lady—, pardon my concealing
Names, is a Person of good Birth, of a Family
in good Circumstances, and pass'd with all that
knew her for a Woman of Virtue. Her modest
behaviour gave such a Credit to her, and esta∣blished
her Character so well, that it would
have looked like Malice, and been received in
all Company with a general disgust, so much
as to have drop'd a Word that look'd like De∣traction,
or in the least touch'd her Fame.</P>
<P>SHE is admired and courted by several, and,
after some time, married by a Person of good
Fortunes, and even superior Birth; a Man of
Honour and of Quality, and yet, which is now
very rare, a Man of Virtue: He is pleas'd with
his Bride to the last degree; vain of her
Beauty; boasts of her as a Prize carry'd by his
good Fortune from so many Pretenders. But,
alas! what Shagreen covers the usual Smile that
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
sat upon his always pleasant Countenance!
What Torment swell'd his Breast, when, within
the compass of half a Year, he finds the vir∣tuous
Charmer, the Mistress of his chast Af∣fections,
not only with Child, but not able any
longer to conceal, that by the unalterable Laws
of Nature it could not be his.</P>
<P>HE is surprized, he charges her with it, she
confesses it with the utmost Testimonies of pe∣nitence
and regret for the Injury done him,
and, with the f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce of an inimitable Conduct,
reingages him; he forgives her, but finds out
the Man, fights him, wounds him, and is killed
himself in the unequal Quarrel. Miserable
Effect of abus'd Matrimony!</P>
<P>BUT even all this is not the great Point aim'd
at in this Work: Our View is the criminal use
of the lawful Liberties of Matrimony, and
that I shall come to in its Place.</P>
<P>AMONG these however this is not the
least, and therefore proper to this Place, <HI>viz.</HI>
That we find wrong Notions of the matrimonial
Vow, wrong Thoughts of the conjugal Obliga∣tion
have possess'd the Minds of both Men
and Women, and they marry now meerly to
gratify the sensual Part, without the Views
which the Nature of the Thing, called Matri∣mony,
ought to give them. This is what I
call making a jest of the Institution, that mar∣ry
in sport, and, like the little Children, who
not knowing what they are doing, say to one
another, Come, <HI>Let us Play</HI> at Man and
Wife.</P>
<P>THEY that make a jest of marrying, gene∣rally
live to be the Jest both of the married
and unmarried World; when they marry in jest
they come to mourn in earnest; they tie them∣selves
<PB N="37" REF="49"/>
in Bonds, resolving not to be bound by
the Obligation; and where is the Honesty and
Justice of this? They that have no Sense of
the matrimonial Obligation can have no Sense
of the conjugal Duty; they marry to lie toge∣ther;
and they satisfy the Appetite in the Plea∣sures
of the Marriage Bed. But when that's
over, all the rest, which they had no View of
before, is a Force, a Bondage; and they as
heartily hate the state of Life as a Slave does
his Lot in <HI>Algier</HI> or <HI>Tunis.</HI></P>
<P>LET me go on a little then to furnish the
growing World with better Notions of the
Thing; I say, let me take up a little of this
Work in the needful Enquiry of what Matri∣mony
is, and how we ought to understand it.</P>
<P>THE Ladies indeed run the greatest Risque
in marrying, but the Men cannot be said to
run no hazard, or to have nothing to lose;
a little Consideration before-hand would lessen
the hazard on both Sides, and not only remove
the Dangers but prepare the Minds of the mar∣rying
Couple to act their Parts wisely and pru∣dently,
and to suit themselves to the particular
Circumstances of the Condition which is before
them.</P>
<P>THIS due preparation of the Mind for the
married State, would prevent all the Abuses of
it which I complain of in this Book.</P>
<P>WHEN they come together affectionately,
they will live together affectionately, at least
they will not abandon all Affection to one ano∣ther
afterwards, or not so soon; nor will it be
so likely that they should declare open War
against one another so soon, as when they came
together without any previous Kindness, except
only from the Lips outward.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="50"/>
WHEN they come together deliberately, they
will keep together deliberately; they will not
be so ready to curse the rashness and hurry of
their Marriage, or be so easily disappointed
in one another.</P>
<P>AGAIN, and which is especially to the Pur∣poses
mentioned hereafter in this Work, when
they come together <HI>Coolly</HI> and <HI>Modestly,</HI> they
will not be so apt, by immoderate and furious
Excesses, to dishonour the Marriage Bed, and
abuse one another, as too many do.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is a solemn Work, 'tis pro∣posed
as a sacred Institution, and the conjugal
State is, upon all Occasions, look'd upon, by those
that consider and understand it, as a kind of
Civil Establishment in life; to engage in it
Rashly, and without Consideration, is perfectly
inconsistent with the Nature of the Thing, and
with all that is proposed in it, or expected from
it, at least by wise and sober People.</P>
<P>I cannot enter here upon a Description of all
the several Incidents which render a married
Life happy or miserable; they are innumera∣ble,
and too long to meddle with in a Work so
short as this. But as I am moving all those
(young People especially) who design to marry,
to consider sedately and calmly, and weigh well
the Circumstances, and all the Particulars of what
they are going to engage in, as well of Persons
as Things; so I must add, that let the Circum∣stances
of the married Couple be what they will,
I believe it will be universally true, that those
Matches succeed best which are entered into
with the most serious and thorough Delibera∣tion;
duly debating all the Particulars of the
Persons; seriously engaging the Affections on
both Sides, by mutual reciprocal Endearments,
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
and unseigned sincere Love, founded on real
Merit, Suitability and Virtue. These confirm
the Felicity, if they may not be said really to
constitute it: Nor, in a word, is there one
Match in fifty happy and successful without
it.</P>
<P>NOW, to come to the last Clause in the Title
of this Chapter; it is for want of these calm
deliberate Proceedings in the <HI>Apparatus</HI> of
Matrimony, for want of weighing Circustan∣ces,
and suiting Persons to one another, that
Matrimony is so often abused; suitability of
Persons is one of the greatest and most impor∣tant
Difficulties that lie before the marrying
Couple for their Consideration. The Temper
of the Person is not easily discovered, nor does
it require a little Judgment and Discretion to
dive into the Disposition of the Person; look∣ing
too narrowly for Defects (since all Tempers
may have Failings) may be injurious on one
hand; as covering the Infirmities which dis∣cover
themselves too evidently, may be inju∣rious
on another.</P>
<P>I knew a certain Lady in the critical Time
of Courship, mighty inquisitive about the
Qualifications, the Temper, and the Merit of
the Gentleman; and it was thought she shewed
abundance of Prudence and Caution in her Ob∣servation
of his Conduct, and her Enquiries
into his Character. It happened, one particu∣lar
Person, who was very intimate in the Fa∣mily
of the Gentleman, and knew him more
particularly than most did, had so much Inte∣grity
as to inform the Lady's Friend who she
sent to enquire about him, that he was a hard
Drinker, and that particularly he was very ill-humoured
and quarrelsome when in drink; tho'
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
'twas allowed that he was very well tempered
when sober, and, in general, had the Character
of a good-humoured Man.</P>
<P>IT seems no Body else was so kind, or so just
to her, or so well acquainted with his Humour,
as to acquaint her of this Part, but that one
Person; and the Lady either liking the Man, or
having particularly a mind to be married, or
what else over-ruled her, I know not, but she took
this Account, which was the only faithful and
sincere one that she had given her, to be mali∣cious
and false; so she went on with her Affair,
as before, giving no heed to what she had been
so kindly inform'd of.</P>
<P>BUT a little while after, as if Providence
had directed it for her more effectual Informati∣on,
and particularly that she might have no
excuse, and none to blame but her self; I say,
a little after this, he happens to be very
Drunk, and, in his drink, he not only takes
care to give the Lady a Visit, but goes from her
to the House of one of her nearest Relations,
and shows himself there too.</P>
<P>THE Lady surprised, not at his Visit, but at
seeing him in that Condition, as soon as she
could decently dismiss him, went big with her
discovery, and greatly exasperated as well
as disappointed, to make her Complaint, and
give her Passions vent at her Relations, who I
mentioned above. But if she was vexed and
disappointed before, she was both angry and
ashamed now, to find he had so little Diseretion
in his Wine, as to go and show and expose him∣self
there, so that when she saw it, she could
not forbear reproaching him with it, and that
in the bitterest Terms imaginable.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="53"/>
THE Gentleman stood pretty patiently a
good while, and bore it all, better than they
that knew him expected he should, considering
he was very drunk, till the Lady giving her
Passions a full vent, fell upon him in a down∣right
scold, and ended it with a forbidding him
to wait upon her any more, that is to say, bad
him give himself no farther trouble about her,
for she had enough of him, and the like.</P>
<P>THUS far, <HI>I say,</HI> he held it very well, con∣sidering
his Condition: But when she came to
that Part, he looked steadily at her, and with a
smiling pleasant Countenance, contrary to his
usual Custom when he had been drinking, he
turns to her, Ha Madam! <HI>says he,</HI> are you so
hot and in such a rage! <HI>Pray, have you been drink∣ing
too?</HI> That put her quite mad; and she re∣viled
him, told him she scorn'd him, and his
Quesion too, that she would have him be in∣formed
she was no such Person, and a great
deal more. No Madam! <HI>says he,</HI> are you not
in drink, and yet can be in such a Rage?
Are you so Passionate as this when you are so∣ber?
whereas, you see, I can be such a patient
Dog when I am drunk; why then, Madam,
says he, in good Faith, I'll take you at your
word, for you are not fit to make a Wife for
me. So he takes a Glass of Wine, and drinks
to her better Fortune, bad her good buy, and
immediately, paying his Respects to the Gen∣tleman
of the House, he walks out, and goes a∣way.</P>
<P>IF
she was angry before, she was calm, per∣fectly
calm, and surprized to the last degree, to
see her self treated so soberly by a Man that
was hardly himself; and that she was rejected
in earnest, whereas she had rejected him but in

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="42" REF="58"/>
a kind of a Passion, and did not intend to be
taken at her word.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, notwithstanding all this, and
notwithstanding she saw him in drink several
times after that, and sometimes when he did not
preserve his Temper, as he did then, yet this Lady
married him after it all; <HI>And what followed?</HI>
As she had reason to expect, so it prov'd; she
was as compleatly miserable in a Husband as a
married Life could well make any Woman be;
for he proved not only drunken, but a passionate
outragious Wretch in his drink, and that to her
in particular.</P>
<P>IT is true, he was very obliging and good-tempered
out of his Excesses; but then, as he
grew older, the Vice encreased upon him; till
at last, so little made him drunk, and he was so
seldom sober, that she had the most Vexations,
and the least Intervals of Quiet that ever Lady
had; and all this for want of obeying not only
the intelligence of her faithful Friend, but
even the kind discovery which Providence made
to her, as it were, on purpose, and past her
being able to doubt the truth of it; so that in∣deed
she had no Body to blame.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Case, and not to insist
upon the drunkenness of a particular Person,
here or there, which may be said to be an Ac∣cident
to the Temper, but without this, the
discording Tempers of the Party is as great,
and as effectual a Cause of the abuse of the ma∣trimonial
Peace, as any thing else can be.</P>
<P>I have mentioned the sad Consequences of
discording Constitutions, in a Chapter by it
self, and which often occasions a great abuse
of the matrimonial Duty, and particularly of
the Marriage Bed; but that is not the Point I
<PB N="43" REF="59"/>
am upon here; the difference of Tempers is yet
a thousand times worse, for this makes a conti∣nued
Breach in every thing they do or say, ru∣ins
the whole Family-Peace, destroys the Com∣fort
of Life, expels Religion and every good
thing; for, as the Scripture says, <HI>where there is
Strife and Contention, there is every evil Work.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS the horror of Matrimony when two
contrary Tempers come together, when Fire
and Tinder meet, they certainly blaze toge∣ther;
when the Spark and the Gunpowder touch,
the whole House is blown up; 'tis great pity to
see in some Families a patient Wife and a fu∣rious
Husband, or a patient sober Husband, and
a termagant fiery Scold; because there is the ut∣most
Oppression on one side, and the utmost Rage
and Violence on the other.</P>
<P>BUT to have two <HI>Devils</HI> together in one
House, what can be expected but Ruin and
Confusion to the whole Family? and at last
either separation or destruction.</P>
<P>IT is meerly for want of a suitability of Tem∣per,
that the Peace of so many Families is lost
and destroyed, and Matrimony abused, and that
so many, once happy People, are made mise∣rable.
But I shall say more of this still.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is a state of Union, 'tis the
nearest union that the Sexes can be placed in.
This Union is appointed in order to the mutual
felicity of the Parties; 'tis then a state that
both Parties should be particularly careful of,
and of their Conduct in, that they may make
it answer the End for which it was so ap∣pointed,
namely to preserve, and indeed to
procure, the mutual Happiness to the Parties,
and make that Union effectual.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="60"/>
HOW impossible do we make this to our
selves, when we invert the great End and De∣sign
even of GOD himself, who instituted and
appointed it; and when we make the sacred Or∣dinance
a retreat for Crime, a cover for our
Excesses, and a protection to the most abomi∣nable
Practices.</P>
<P>THIS is what I call abusing the state of
Matrimony as well as dishonouring the Con∣tract.
Matrimony is not a single Act, but it
is a Condition of Life, and therefore when
People are new-married, they are said to have
altered their Condition; it is a Series of Unity
contracted by, and should be made up of agreeing
Habits; where the Harmony is broken, the state
of Life is abused; when the Parties cease to be
united, and to be united too in that which is
right, the Life is no more matrimonial; 'tis a
Jargon of Speech, a Word without significa∣tion,
to call it a matrimonial Life.</P>
<P>IN the Contract the Parties bind themselves
to live in this Harmony and state of Union;
what else is understood by living <HI>according
to GOD's holy Ordinance.</HI> How do they live
according to a holy Ordinance, whose Conver∣sation
even towards one another, and with one
another, pollutes and defiles the state of Life,
and would the very Ordinance too, if that were
possible?</P>
<P>HOW the Conversation between a Man
and his Wife may and does pollute and de∣file
the matrimonial State, (however strange
such a thing may be) is the Subject of the
following Chapters, where the Affirmative will,
I doubt not, be clearly made out.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of MATRIMONIAL CHASTITY, what
is to be understood by the Word; a
Proof of its being required by the Laws
of GOD and Nature, and that wrong
Notions of it have possess'd the World.
Dr. Taylor's Authority quoted about
it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Am yet settling Preliminaries;
the Work I am upon will have so
many Opposers, such Cavillings
and Quarrellings, as well at the
Subject, as at the Manner of
of handling it, that I am obliged
to provide my Defences in time against all
the Batteries of the Enemy.</P>
<P>I have this to boast of for Encouragement,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that I know my Argument to be invul∣nerable;
all the Arts of Hell cannot evade the
force of it; if there is the least Defect, it must
be in the weakness of the Performance. Good
Weapons may be rendred useless or insufficient
in an unskilful Hand; but as no Man else has
ever undertaken it, I must venture, I'll manage
it as well as I can.</P>
<P>IN the former Chapter I have explained
the matrimonial Obligation, what I mean by
<PB N="46" REF="62"/>
the word Matrimony, how it should be under∣stood,
and in what sense I understand it in the
following Work. I repeat nothing.</P>
<P>I am now to explain another Term equally
significant, tho' little taken notice of among us,
a Word thought to be difficult, but is not diffi∣cult;
absolutely necessary to be understood to∣wards
the right reading this Book, and parti∣cularly
useful to its explanation, I mean MA∣TRIMONIAL
CHASTITY; 'tis the Breach of
this Chastity that is the Subject of the whole
Work, and 'tis therefore, I say, absolutely ne∣cessary
to understand what it is.</P>
<P>THE exercise of lawful Enjoyments is one
of the greatest Snares of Life; where Men
seem to be left to their own Latitudes, 'tis too
natural to think they are not obliged to any Re∣straint;
but 'tis a great Mistake: Christian Li∣mitation
is the true measure of human Liberty;
where Heaven has had the goodness to leave us
without a limitation, he expects we should li∣mit
our selves with the more exactness; and
perhaps 'tis the intent and meaning of that
seeming unlimited Liberty (for 'tis no more)
that our Virtue may have a fair Field for its
trial, and that we may more eminently shew
our Christian Temperance, in using those Li∣berties
with the same Moderation where we
have no positive Restraints imposed, as we
would others, where we are under a direct and
absolute Command.</P>
<P>BEING therefore about to reprehend the
Breaches of this Moderation, and, in a word,
to combat the Exorbitances of unlimited Life,
'tis absolutely necessary to know what they are;
and to lay down, with the utmost plainness
<PB N="47" REF="63"/>
that decency will permit, what it is I am to
engage against, and for what Reasons.</P>
<P>CHASTITY is a Virtue much talked of,
little practised, a great Noise is made with the
word <HI>Chastity,</HI> and, on many Occasions, where
little true regard is had to the thing, and per∣haps
where 'tis little understood; 'tis taken
among us for a meer Regulation of Manners,
and a kind of Government of Life. But the
definition is infinitely short of the thing it
self, which is of a high and superior kind; it
is a rectitude of Nature, an inherent Bright∣ness
of the Soul, I'll give you a better descrip∣tion
of it presently, and a better describer
also, for I must speak with Authority, if pos∣sible,
where I have so much to say, and which
you will like so little.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Chastity</HI> in general be so little under∣stood,
the <HI>Chastity</HI> I speak of is infinitely more
out of the way of your ordinary thinking: <HI>Ma∣trimonial
Chastity!</HI> 'tis a new strange Term, said,
one of my critical Observers before I published
this Work; you must be sure to tell us what
you mean by it, or it will not be intelligible:
What, <HI>says he,</HI> are you going to lay down Rules
and Laws for the Marriage Bed! Are you going
to enclose what Heaven has left free, and pre∣tending
to shew us the deficiency of GOD's
Laws, supply that deficiency with some wiser
Rules of your own? 'Tis against Nature, as well
as against Heaven. But this Reproof is mis∣placed,
and the Reprover mistaken. I am far
from adding to the Restraints that Nature, and
the GOD of Nature have laid upon us, but am
for shewing you what Restraints they are; and
particularly to let you see, there are some Re∣straints
<PB N="48" REF="64"/>
where you suggest, and perhaps believe,
there are really none.</P>
<P>YOU acknowledge, that <HI>Chastity</HI> in general
is a Virtue, and a Christian Duty; and I affirm
there is a particular <HI>Chastity,</HI> that is to say, a
limited Liberty, which is to be observed and
strictly submitted to in the conjugal State;
This I call <HI>Matrimonial Chastity,</HI> and the Breach
of this I call, as in my Title, matrimonial
Whoredom; let others call it what they will, I
can give it no other Name than what I think it
deserves.</P>
<L>“Tho' they're called Misses which lewd Men adore,</L>
<L>I cannot guild their Crimes, a Whore's a Whore.”</L>
<P>HAVING thus entered upon the difficult
Task of reproving those criminal Practices of
Men, which are acted under the shelter of sup∣posed
lawful Liberty, I must state the due
Bounds and Extent of that Liberty, that we may
the better ground our future Censures, and be
able to justify the Reproof from the Rules esta∣blished
in the Foundation.</P>
<P>NOW, that I may do this with the better
Authority. I begin with quoting the late Pious
and Reverend Dr. <HI>Taylor;</HI> in his Book of <HI>Holy
Living,</HI> he has a whole Chapter upon this very
Subject, I mean of <HI>Chastity,</HI> and I cannot take
my Arguments from a better Beginning.</P>
<P>“Chastity, says the Doctor, is the Circumci∣sion
of the Heart, the suppressing all irregu∣lar
Desires in the Matter of carnal and sen∣sual
Pleasures.”</P>
<P>HERE the Doctor has made a Provision to en∣counter
the merry Disputants of this Age, as
pungent and as natural, as if he had been now
<PB N="49" REF="65"/>
alive, and knew the highth to which the corrupt
Imaginations of Men have carried those irregular
Desires: What do you pretend to call Irregular,
said a cavilling favourer of Vice to me once,
also before this Book was thought of? What
can be Irregular between a Man and his
Wife?</P>
<P>I shall have more to say to that Question in
the next Chapters, and doubt not to speak to
the Conviction of reasonable Creatures: As to
human Brutes I am not looking towards them,
much less talking to them in a Discourse of
<HI>Chastity;</HI> let them alone to their <HI>irregular De∣sires,</HI>
and let the success of those gratify'd De∣sires
be their reprover; they generally end
in Repentance, or, which is worse, Self-re∣proaches.
But I come back to Dr. <HI>Taylor.</HI></P>
<P>“I call all those Desires irregular, says the
Reverend Doctor.”</P>
<P>“1. THAT are not within the <HI>holy Insti∣tution,</HI>
or within the Protection of <HI>Mar∣riage.”</HI></P>
<P>“2. THAT are not within the Order of Na∣ture.”</P>
<P>“3. THAT are not within the Moderation
of Christian Modesty.”</P>
<P>IN this last Head he includes (to use his own
Words) <HI>all immoderate use of permitted Beds,</HI>
which is exactly to the purpose that I am
speaking of, and upon which Subject the second
Chapter of this Book is chiefly employ'd.</P>
<P>“CONCERNING which, <HI>says the same worthy
Author,</HI> Judgment is to be made as concern∣ing
Meats and Drinks, there being no certain
degree of frequency or intention prescribed to
<PB N="50" REF="66"/>
any Person, but it is to be ruled as the other
Actions of Man's Life are ruled, <HI>viz.”</HI></P>
<P>“1. BY the Proportion to the End.”</P>
<P>“2. BY the Dignity of the Person as a
Christian.”</P>
<P>“3. BY the other Particulars, of which he
speaks afterwards.”</P>
<P>“CHASTITY (says he) is the Grace which
forbids and restrains all these, keeping both
the Body and the Soul pure, in the state GOD
has placed it, whether of a single or married
Life, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> iv. 3, 4, 5.”</P>
<P>AND now having quoted so eminent an
Author as Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> whose Works are so well
known, let me put all my good Friends, <HI>who
watch for my halting,</HI> in mind, that the Doctor
having this very Article upon his Hands, and
being resolved to speak critically, and yet fully,
to it, he takes all due caution in the doing it,
just as I have done. <HI>First,</HI> He cautions the
Reader against unjust Censure and Reproach.
(2.) He then fortifies himself against the
Fears of it: And, <HI>Lastly,</HI> speaks boldly and
plainly where Duty calls upon him to do so.
Just in this manner you may expect me to
act, in that critical Article of Liberty which
is before me.</P>
<P>THE Doctor, it appears, knew how the
World was vitiated, and the Minds of Men
corrupted, even in his Day, and that it was a
most dangerous thing to speak of such things as
these in the Ears of a lewd Set of People, which
the World was then full of; That they would cor∣rupt
the most sanctified Advice, and insult the
Adviser, and therefore as I have done here, so
<PB N="51" REF="67"/>
the devout Doctor gives caution, and enters his
Protest against misconstruction and misunder∣standing
of what he was to say; this he
does with infinite Modesty and Reserve, but
ventures for all that upon the Reproof as a
necessary Work; his Example is highly useful
to me in this equally necessary Work, of lay∣ing
open the Crimes of the present Age;
which, it must be acknowledged, is much far∣ther
advanced in Wickedness than the Times
the Doctor lived in. His Words are these:
<Q>Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s Preamble to his Chapter upon the
Subject of <HI>CHASTITY.</HI></Q></P>
<P>“READER, stay, <HI>says be,</HI> and read not the
Advices of the following Section, unless that
thou hast a chast Spirit; <HI>and in another Place
he says,</HI> unless thou hast a chast Spirit, and
unless thou art desirous of being chast, or at
least art apt to consider whether thou oughtest
or not. For there are some Spirits so <HI>Atheisti∣cal,</HI>
and some so wholly possess'd with the
Spirit of uncleanness, that they turn the
most prudent and chast Discourses into
dirty and filthy Apprehensions; like cho∣lerick
Stomachs, changing their very Cor∣dials
and Medicines into bitterness, and, in
a literal sense, <HI>turning the Grace of God into
Wantonness.”</HI></P>
<P>“THESE Men study Cases of Conscience in
the Matter of carnal Sins, not to avoid them,
but to learn Ways how to offend GOD, and pol∣lute
their own Spirits; searching their Houses
with a Sun-beam, that they may be inform'd
of all the Corners of Nastiness.”</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="68"/>
“I have used all the care I cou'd in the fol∣lowing
Periods, that I might neither be
wanting to assist those that need it, nor yet
minister any Occasion of fancy or vainer
Thoughts to those that need them not. If
any Man will snatch the pure Taper from my
hand, and hold it to the Devil, he will only burn
his own Fingers, but shall not rob me of the
reward of my Care and good Intention, since I
have taken heed how to express the following
Duties, and given him caution how to read
them.”</P>
<P>THUS far Dr. <HI>Taylor.</HI> He had but one Chap∣ter,
or Section, <HI>as he calls it,</HI> upon the Subject
of Chastity, and yet you see how wary he was,
least the ill digesture of the Times should turn
that which he designed for the wholesome Nou∣rishment
of the Mind, to a corrupt and unclean
purpose. How much more have I just ground to
warn the Reader of this Work, that he may for∣bear
reading it with a Design to gratify or please
a tainted and vitiated Imagination? Let him
rather prepare to read a just Reproof of the vi∣lest
Actions, with the same detestation and ab∣horrence
that I write it with, and with such
clean Thoughts as becomes a Mind seasoned
with Virtue, awed by Religion, and prepared
by a due Reverence to the divine Command.</P>
<P>To <HI>the pure</HI> all things <HI>are pure,</HI> to <HI>the unclean</HI>
all things <HI>are unclean;</HI> they that are disposed to
ridicule and make a jest of the just Satyr here
pointed at Crime, will but make a jest of them∣selves;
since nothing can be more evident than
the Offence, nothing can be more just than
the Reproof. If Men will defile themselves, as
the <HI>Scots</HI> say, <HI>no Man can dight them.</HI> 'Tis very
<PB N="53" REF="69"/>
strange a Man should be afraid to expose a
Crime for fear of encreasing it, as if the very
Shame should excite to the Sin.</P>
<P>BUT I must keep to the Point, and to which
I resolve to confine my self. <HI>Chastity</HI> is no po∣pular
Subject, 'tis so broken into upon all Hands,
and with such a Gust of general desire, that to
rake into the Filth must be disagreeable to the
generality of People; and tho' I do not let it
alone for that Reason, being not at all reluctant
to an attack upon a Crime, because grown fla∣grant
and universal, yet at present I am upon
another Subject; I am attacking a Crime
equally odious, but which is not equally ac∣knowledged
to be a Crime, a Wickedness which
even some that pretend to Purity of Life will
not allow to be wicked.</P>
<P>SO much more is the Danger, when Men
walk among Barrels of Gunpowder, and know
it not to be Gunpowder, who shall be cautious
of his Candle? It is not so hard to persuade
such Men to shun the Evil, as to convince them
that it is an Evil; they cavil at the very Title
of this Chapter <HI>Matrimonial Chastity,</HI> 'tis Non∣sence,
they say, in the Nature of the thing;
Virgin Chastity indeed, and Chastity of a single
Person, is something, and would bear to be
exhorted to; but married Chastity is what they
will by no means understand, or bear a Reproof
about.</P>
<P>BUT because I have, as I said above, a whole
Chapter upon this very Subject, and only men∣tion
it here with respect to Opinions of good
Men about it, give me leave to quote the Re∣verend
Person just now nam'd upon the same
Subject, and refer you afterward to my own
Opinion in the following Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="70"/>
DR. <HI>Taylor,</HI> in his Discourse of <HI>Chastity</HI> men∣tioned
above, after having spoken of Virgin
Chastity and Vidual Chastity, comes of course
to mention the very Thing I am now upon,
and in the very same Terms, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MATRIMONIAL CHASTITY.</HEAD>
<P>And I choose to give it you in his own Words,
because, before I remembered that the Doctor
had mentioned this Case, I had finished the
next Chapters, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Bounds and Limita∣tions
which Modesty and Decency had placed
to the Liberties of the Marriage Bed, and which
the Doctor's Opinion so far confirms, that I could
not but subjoin his Thoughts after my own was
gone to the Press. The Doctor's Rules for mar∣ried
Persons are thus express'd:</P>
<P>“CONCERNING married Persons, besides
the keeping their mutual Faith and Contract
with each other, these Particulars are useful
to be observed.”</P>
<P>“1. ALTHOUGH their mutual Endearments
are safe within the Protection of Marriage,
yet they that have Wives or Husbands, must
be as tho' they had them not; that is, they
must have an Affection greater to each other
than they have to any Person in the World,
but not greater than they have to GOD: but
that they be ready to part with all Interest in
each other's Person, rather than sin against
GOD.”</P>
<P>“IN their Permission and Licence, they must
be sure to observe the Order of Nature, and
the Ends of GOD. <HI>He is an ill Husband, that
uses his Wife as a Man treats a Harlot,</HI> having
no other End but Pleasure. Concerning
<PB N="55" REF="71"/>
which our best Rule is, that although in this,
as in eating and drinking, there is an Appe∣tite
to be satisfied, which cannot be done
without pleasing that desire; yet since that
desire and satisfaction was intended by Nature
for other Ends, they should never be separate
from those Ends, but always be joined with all
or one of those Ends, <HI>with a desire of Children,
or to avoid Fornication, or to lighten and ease
the cares and sadnesses of Houshold-affair, or to
endear each other;</HI> but never with a purpose,
either in act or desire to separate the sensua∣lity
from these Ends which hallow it. <HI>Onan</HI>
did separate his Act from its proper End, and
so ordered his Embraces that his Wife should
not conceive, and GOD punished him.”</P>
<P>“3. MARRIED Persons must keep such mo∣desty
and decency of treating each other, that
they never force themselves into high and
violent Lusts, with arts and misbecoming de∣vices:
always remembring that those Mix∣tures
are most innocent which are <HI>most simple</HI>
and <HI>most natural, most orderly</HI> and most safe.”</P>
<P>“4. IT is a duty of matrimonial Chastity to
be restrained and temperate in the use of
their lawful Pleasures: Concerning which,
although no universal Rule can antecedently
be given to all Persons, any more than to all
Bodies one proportion of Meat and Drink;
yet married Persons are to estimate the degree
of their Licence according to the following
Proportions. 1. That it be moderate, so as to
consist with Health. 2. That it be so ordered
as not to be too extensive of Time, that pre∣cious
opportunity of working out our Sal∣vation.
3. That when Duty is demanded it
be always payed (so far as in our Powers and
<PB N="56" REF="72"/>
Election) according to the foregoing Measures.
4. That it be with a temperate Affection,
without violent transporting Desires, or too
sensual Applications. Concerning which a
Man is to make Judgment by proportion to
other Actions, and the Severities of his Reli∣gion,
and the Sentences of sober and wife
Persons; always remembring, that Marriage
is a Provision for supply of the natural Ne∣cessities
of the Body, not for the artificial and
procured Appetites of the Mind. And it is
a sad truth, that many married Persons think∣ing
that the Flood-gates of Liberty are set
wide open without Measures or Restraints (so
they fail in that Channel) have felt the final
Rewards of their Intemperance and Lust, by
their unlawful using of lawful Permissions.
Only therefore let each of them be temperate,
and both of them be modest.”</P>
<P>THUS far the Reverend Doctor, a Man whose
Character gave him an undoubted Right to the
Title of a true spiritual Guide, thorowly qua∣lified
in his time for a Teacher of Holy Living.</P>
<P>I add nothing, only that here is a Confirma∣tion
indeed unexpected of all the Principles
which I have advanced in this Work.</P>
<P>HERE is a full Concession to the real occasion
and even necessity of my present Undertaking;
the Doctor grants, that married Persons even at
that time thought the Flood-gates of Liberty were
set open to them, and that (as I said) Modesty
and Decency was at an End after Marriage, and
there was no more Restraint between a Man
and his Wife.</P>
<P>BUT you will find the Doctor quite of another
Opinion, as I also am; and I am very glad to have
so unquestioned an Authority for my Opinion.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the End and Reason of MATRIMONY,
and that there is a needful Modesty and
Decency requisite even between a Man
and his Wife after Marriage, the
Breaches of which make the first Branch
of Matrimonial Whoredom.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Ends and Reason of Matrimo∣ny
are assigned by our Church in
the Office, or Introduction to the
Office for marrying such Persons
as may be lawfully join'd together;
if I repeat them, I hope no Reproof can lie
against me there; the most modest Virgin
submits to be told, that the Reason of joining
her self to a Man, is principally for the Procrea∣tion
of Children; 'tis the Law of Generation
given both to the Man and to the Woman at first;
'tis twisted with their very Natures, and placed
among the first Principles of Life; and 'tis
also the Law of GOD, given to Man imperative∣ly
at the same time that he joined to it his
Blessing, <HI>Gen. i. 28. And GOD blessed them, and
GOD said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply,
and replenish the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="74"/>
IN this great Law of Matrimony is founded
the utmost Intercourse and familiarity of the
Sexes, by which all that Shyness, that modest
Reserve and Restraint, all that which is called
shamefacedness and blushing, even in the most
modest and chast Virgin, is taken away; that is
to say, so far only, and no farther, as respects
her immediate Intimacy and Conversation with
her own Husband; she freely strips off her
Cloths in the Room with him, and where∣as
she would not have shew'd him her Foot be∣fore,
without her Shoe and Stocking on, she
now, without the least Breach of Modesty, goes
into what we call the naked Bed to him, and
with him; lies in his Arms, and in his Bosom,
and sleeps safely, <HI>and with security to her Virtue</HI>
with him, all the Night: And this is her Place,
her Property, her Privilege, exclusive of all
others, for he is her own, and she is his; he is
the <HI>covering of the Eyes to her,</HI> and she is called,
in the sacred Text, the <HI>Wife of his Bosom;</HI> she
has the only right to lodge there; it is her Re∣treat,
the Repository of her Cares, as well as of
her Delight, and of her Affection.</P>
<P>AND if it is not thus with both or either of
them, nay, if it was not thus before they mar∣ried,
let them flatter themselves as they please
with the formal Marriage, or the formality of
Matrimony, I insist they have violated the
Laws of GOD and Man, in their coming toge∣ther;
violated their solemn Oath and Covenant
to one another after coming together; and
whatever they are in the Sense of the Law,
they are really no Man and Wife at all in the
Sense which I am giving of Things: Whether
I am in the right or no, I refer to the Judg∣ment
of the impartial Part of sober Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="75"/>
HAVING said thus much by way of ad∣vance,
I think 'tis necessary to take notice here
how just it is, and indispensibly, nay, absolute∣ly
necessary to the Happiness of a married Life,
that the Persons marrying should have not only
an Acquainiance with one another before Mar∣riage,
but that they should be engaged to each
other by a solid and durable Affection, profes∣sing
to love, and not only professing but sin∣cerely
loving one another, above all other
Persons choosing and being the real choice of
each other: This is not a small and trifling
thing, it is the chief Article of Matrimony, tho'
not included and asserted in the Contract, 'tis a∣thing
of the utmost Consequence to the future
Happiness of the Parties. However, as I pur∣pose
to speak to it again fully and at large, in
a Part by it self, I only leave it here as a
Memorandum proper to the Place, and reserve
the rest to what shall come after. I return now
to the Case of Matrimonial Liberty.</P>
<P>HAVING advanced thus much in favour of
the utmost Freedoms between Man and Wife,
and which I might enlarge upon, but that I
believe there is really no Occasion; I think I
grant as much in it as I need to do, in Conde∣scension
to the Proposition mentioned in the
Introduction, namely, that there can be no Of∣fence
between a Man and his Wife, that Mo∣desty
is at an End, that 'tis cancelled by the
very nature of the Thing, that all Things are
Decent, all Things modest, all Things lawful
between a Man and his Wife; all which, in a
few Words, I deny, and insist, that there are se∣veral
Things yet remaining, which stand as
Boundaries and Limits to the Freedoms and In∣timacies
that are otherwise to be allowed between
a Man and his Wife.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="76"/>
AND first, I insist that these limitations
of the conjugal Liberties are placed in the open
View of both the Man and his Wife, by the
Laws of Nature; so that both of them are fur∣nished
with Principles of Reluctance and Aver∣sion,
sufficient, if duly listen'd to, and if the
Laws of Nature are obeyed, to arm them against
any Breaches of those Laws. It is evident
in many Cases, too many, had it not pleased
GOD to suffer it to be so, that the Laws of Na∣ture
have a much stronger Influence upon us
than the Laws of our Maker; and this is espe∣cially
remarkable in those Cases, where the
Laws of Nature seem to give some Latitudes
which the Laws of GOD, and Institutions of
his Providence, have thought fit to limit and
restrain. <HI>For example;</HI></P>
<P>THE Laws of Nature dictate the propagation
of Kind by the intercourse of Sexes; the Laws
of GOD subsequent to those of Nature, limit
and restrain the Particulars of this Propagation,
namely, that the Man (by Man there is to be
understood Man or Woman) should be allowed
but one Woman at a time, that they be bound
together by the sacred Bonds of Matrimony in∣dissolvable,
after once engaged in, and there∣fore
sacred, and to be inviolably adhered to, and
preserved by both Parties.</P>
<P>IT is true, that there is a corrupt Prin∣ciple
inbred and indwelling, taking a kind of
Possession, too much in Man's Nature, degene∣rated
as it is by the Fall; this corrupt Prin∣ciple
dictates the Propagation of the Kind, that
is, as a Law of Nature, but does it without
regard to the limitations imposed by Heaven
upon the Branches; that is to say, without
entring into the Engagements of Matrimony,
<PB N="61" REF="77"/>
and this makes those Actions criminal, which
otherwise would have been lawful; makes the
Man commit a Crime in that very Action, which
done under due Regulations and Limitations,
that is to say, in Wedlock, would not only be
lawful, but his commanded Duty.</P>
<P>IT is the same afterwards; <HI>for example,</HI>
when those Limitations are obeyed and sub∣mitted
to, I mean, the Limitations of Matri∣mony,
there are (as I have observed) yet
farther Limitations, which the Laws of Nature
concur with the Laws of GOD in, and which
the Man is obliged to observe, tho' this corrupt
Principle would fain evade and avoid them;
these are such as I hinted to be contained in the
Words <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Modesty:</HI> Now tho' much
of the Obligation is taken off by the allowed
Intimacies between a Man and his Wife, and a
full and free Intercourse of Sexes is granted; yet
I must be pardoned the liberty of saying, there
are Bounds and Limitations of Decency, Mo∣desty
and Moderation, which stand as a Pale
about even their matrimonial Liberties, and
say to them both, in the midst of their greatest
Endearments, Hitherto shall you go, <HI>and no
farther.</HI></P>
<P>AS I am speaking to the married Persons
only, in this Part, I need explain my self no
farther than to say, there are Bounds and Mea∣sures,
Times and Seasons, which Nature and
Decency always will dictate to them, and will
regulate too, and teach them to regulate be∣tween
themselves their most intimate conju∣gal
Delights and Embraces: These nothing but
an Appetite criminally immoderate, and under
no Government, no not of Reason, Religion,
<PB N="62" REF="78"/>
Philosophy, or common Sense; will trespass or
break through.</P>
<P>I hope I have hitherto kept the Bounds of
Decency, and given no Offence, though I am
reproving one of the most notorious Breaches
of conjugal Modesty; a thing even Nature her
self abhors, tho' Nature vitiated may be said to
be the Occasion of it; I say, Nature, under any
just Regulation of Sense, Nature, abstracted
from criminal Habits, abhors, it; and, which is
more, Nature speaks plainer in her Reproofs of
that Crime than I dare do, while the Product
of those impure and unlawful, however matri∣monial
Liberties, carry the indelible Marks of
their Parents unhappy Excesses and Intempe∣rances
in their Faces, and on the blotch'd and
bladdred Skin of their Posterity for many
Years, nay, to their dying Days. As if Nature
had declared to them, that she was able to shew
her Resentment for the Breach of her tacit and
secret Inhibitions; and that though they broke
in upon her in secret by the power of an
inflamed and vitiated Appetite, and thought
themselves out of the reach of Punishment,
yet that she was able to do her self Justice upon
them, in a manner that they could not escape,
and which should fix a lasting Infamy upon
both the Offence and the Offender, by a Pu∣nishment
which they should neither be able to
avoid or to conceal.</P>
<P>I need explain my self no farther, Nature
does it for me; and I have, by her Indulgence,
a full liberty to touch this tender Part with the
strictest Observation of my own Rules, since
she has spoken it aloud, and has made the
Crime of the Parent flagrant in the very Pic∣tures
of their Posterity.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="79"/>
HOW do such Children call upon their Pa∣rents
to blush, every time they see the scrophu∣lous
Humours break out, in Scabs and Blisters
upon the poor innocent Lamb's Faces?
making them bear the unhappy Reproach of
their Fathers and Mothers <HI>Conjugal Lewd∣ness?</HI></P>
<P>I
need say no more to this, but to remind
those that are guilty, that the more modest
Brutes of the Forest, who obey the Laws of
Sense, and follow the Dictates of meer Nature,
do not act thus: The <HI>Wild Ass,</HI> which the
Scripture represents as the most vitiated ungo∣verned
of all the Forest, yet the Text says, <HI>in
her Months you shall find her;</HI> she has her Sea∣sons,
and so have all the rest of the bestly
Creatures, and they all observe them strictly
and suitably to the Reasons of Nature, Man
and Woman only excepted.</P>
<P>THIS I call, and I think justly too, as it re∣spects
one Part only, a Branch of <HI>Matrimonial
Whoredom,</HI> and thus I keep close to my Title.</P>
<P>I could load this Part with a throng of Ex∣amples,
a cloud of self-condemned Witnesses,
and some whose Stories I can the less bear to
relate without blushing, because they are ar∣rived
to such a Pitch of Wickedness as to make
it publick themselves without shame. But, as
I said above, Nature has printed upon the
tainted poisoned Faces of their Posterities, such
indelible Spots, has branded them with such
Marks of Infamy, that I may say of them as
was said in another Case, <HI>What need any farther
Witnesses?</HI> Let <HI>L—D—</HI> of St. <HI>A</HI>—'s,
the beautiful Lady—of—, the
modest and better taught <HI>Abr</HI>—, and
more I could name, go home and see what ha∣vock
<PB N="64" REF="80"/>
this conjugal Lewdness has made among
their otherwise pretty Families; I spare Names,
because I desire the Reproof may be Matter of
Reflection to themselves, rather than Scan∣dal.</P>
<P>AS
to some others, who I could mention too
both Christian and Sirname, and who richly de∣serve
it; who are so far from Shame, that they
make it every Day the boasts of their Coffee∣house-chat,
their Table-talk, and ordinary Con∣versation;
I leave them to the dismal Time of
Reproach, when those unhappy Children which
they now are not ashamed to show one another
as the Examples of their Wickedness, shall
again remind them of it, and curse them to
their Faces.</P>
<P>THE Case indeed will not bear entering far∣ther
into Particulars; nor will it so much as al∣low
the necessary Expostulations which I should
otherwise make here with those married Chri∣stains,
(for such I am talking to) who I would
persuade to reflect upon it; 'tis hard, that nei∣ther
the Case itself will bear an enquiring into,
nor the Persons guilty bear to be talked to.
How can any Persons who are really guilty of
this conjugal Uncleanness, reproach an Author
for the Sin of naming what they are not
ashamed of doing? I look upon the Crime with
Abhorrence, and I could refer you to the
Scripture, where it is branded with a Title that
deserves it; as I say, I look on the Crime with
Abhorrence, so I add, that I look on the Per∣sons
with something beyond it, and can only
add this of them, that as they were not to be
touch'd under the Law, so they are not to be
named under the Gospel. GOD would not take
them for <HI>Jews</HI> till they were wash'd, and I
<PB N="65" REF="81"/>
shall never take them for Christians till they
reform; let them read their Reproof at large in
<HI>Levit.</HI> xv. to which I refer.</P>
<P>I cannot quit this Part without making some
Reflections upon parallel Cases. I have heard
some serious and learned Divines say, that it is
a worse Crime, and deserves a severer Censure
from Man, (observe they did not speak of what
either of them merited above) for a Man and
Woman under Promises of Marriage to lie to∣gether
before the Marriage is compleated, than
a simple or single Fornication between two
who have no design of Matrimony, that is in
short, between what we ordinarily call a Whore
and a Rogue; and I confess, though at first I
hesitated a little at it, I am fully satisfied it is
so; and the Reasons the said serious Divines
gave me confirm me in that Opinion.</P>
<P>FOR a Man to commit a single Fornication, <HI>say
they,</HI> he Sins against GOD, and his own Soul,
there is no Room to deny that; the Scripture
is clear, and the Laws of GOD and Man concur
in the Censure, as they do in the Prohibition:
But for a Man to make a Whore of the very
Woman who he intends and really designs to
make his Wife, or, in plain <HI>English,</HI> to make a
Whore of his Wife; he defiles his own Bed,
pollutes his own Seed, spreads Bastardy in his
own Race, and shews a most wicked vitiated
Appetite, that could not with-hold himself
from her <HI>meerly as a Woman,</HI> till the Performance
of a lawful Marriage might make it season∣able,
as well as lawful; such a Man satisfies the
brutal Part at the expence of his Wife's Fame,
his Child's Legitimacy, and to the scandal and
offence of all good People that shall hear it,
<PB N="66" REF="82"/>
and who cannot name it without pity, or ab∣horrence,
on account of the Circumstances.</P>
<P>THIS is the Case indeed, where a Man acts
such a wicked and scandalous Part; he appa∣rently
exposes and dishonours his Wife, as well
as himself nor is it sufficient to say, that the
Woman dishonours her self too, or that there is
much more of the Blame lies on him than on
her; for as she sufficiently bears her Share of the
Reproach, so she bears more of the Scandal, than
the Man; nay, she exposes her self, not to the
World only, but to her Husband afterward;
and much might be said to that: Nor is it out
of the question, for it is indeed a Matrimonial
Whoredom in the literal Sense.</P>
<P>BUT as such I shall speak of it again. I am
now naming it as it is a parallel Case to that
I had been just now speaking of, wherein there
is a just equality, and a proportion of Particu∣lars
very apposite to one another; for here is a
horrid Complication of the like Crimes, the
Man defiles his own Bed, exposes his own
Wife, contaminates and corrupts his own Blood,
spreads Distempers and Poison upon his own
Race, and all this from one of the grossest Pieces
of Immodesty, and worst of Brutality, that can
be express'd in Words; an infamous kind of
eagerness or appetite, ungovernable by his Rea∣son,
being unable (or pretending to be so at
least) to with-hold himself from her till other
Particulars might take off the little Restraints,
and leave him at liberty.</P>
<P>LET such Men go not to the Forest and the
Beasts only, for they act from a much better
Motion, but to the more rational, more mode∣rate
and better governed Savages of the <HI>Indies,
Fast</HI> or <HI>West,</HI> to the Negroes of <HI>Africa,</HI> the
<PB N="67" REF="83"/>
<HI>Potiguara</HI>'s of <HI>Brasile,</HI> nay, to the very <HI>Hotten∣tots</HI>
of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI>
they will find Reason and Nature too pre∣vails
among them to act quite otherwise, and
that while Reason and Nature concur in arm∣ing
them against it, so they more punctually
obey the command of both, and have this hor∣rid
Practice in the greatest detestation. But
here, let us blush, and say no more, for no mo∣dest
Language can fully express it.</P>
<P>I return to the Principle, which is the Pro∣position
in this Chapter, That there is a need∣ful
Modesty and Decency requisite even be∣tween
a Man and his Wife after Marriage, and
not destroyed by their Matrimony. Certainly
People do not by Matrimony cease to be Men
and Women, nor do the Man and Woman cease
to be rational Creatures, much less do they cease
to be Christians; let every marry'd Couple re∣member
those three Things, and I am fully as∣sured
they will take care not to deserve the Re∣proof
of this Chapter.</P>
<P>THIS is then that Circumstance in the mar∣ried
State, where, I say, a Reserve is placed be∣tween
the Sexes, even between the Man and
his Wife; where that which we call Modesty
remains as an indelible Bond upon them both,
even after Marriage: They that say there is no
Modesty to be named after Matrimony, but that
there is a perfect unlimited and unbounded Li∣berty
on both Sides, either do not know, or do
not rightly consider the Laws of Nature, the
Constitution Bonds, which, as Matrimony does
not remove from the Sexes, so neither does it
remove the Obligation from either Sex to regard
them. One would think indeed the Power of Na∣ture
should be such, and the Sense of these things
<PB N="68" REF="84"/>
be so plainly stampt in the Minds of reasona∣ble
Creatures, that there should be no need, or
indeed room for the Caution. But as the
Breach of this Law, however scandalous, is so
visible among us; it merits to stand foremost
among the conjugal Crimes I am now to re∣prove.</P>
<P>I
foresee what some of my merry Readers
will think they are to hear of next, <HI>viz.</HI> that I
shall preach Lectures of matrimonial Modera∣tion,
or Satyrize some of their boasted Excesses;
but they will be unhappily disappointed, my
Care of avoiding to reprove in <HI>Words at length;</HI>
what some of them are not ashamed to boast of
in <HI>Words at length,</HI> will perhaps leave some
People to go more unreproved than they de∣serve.</P>
<P>YET
let <HI>J—A—</HI> take a modest Hint upon
the grossest Indecency of that kind, which this
Part of the Town has ever shown, and which he
acted in sight and hearing of more of his
Friends than approved the scandalous Prac∣tice;
when, with the grossest Immodesty, he
gave the detail of his Marriage Night's Per∣formances,
to a grave and eminent Magistrate
of the City upon the open <HI>Exchange,</HI> and was
handsomely reproved and exposed for it, as he
deserved. When Men glory in their Shame,
they make Indecencies of that which might
otherwise not be such, and they break the
Rules of Modesty without Doors, when perhaps
they did not within. But this Part of the Sa∣tyr
goes no farther than the Fact, I return to
the Subject it self.</P>
<P>EVERY wise Man would act the Part of a
wise Man, were there no Law to restrain him.
Prudence dictates to Men of Prudence, and
<PB N="69" REF="85"/>
Modesty to Men of Modesty the great Law of
Matrimony is a strict Union of the Persons;
this Union extends to many other Things, as
well as to the Union of Sexes, and, among the
rest, there is, or should be, a Union of Kindness
moving to a gentle and tender using one ano∣ther
in Matters of Civility and Courtesy, as
well as in Matters of Modesty. Certainly the
Rules of Civility are not abolished by Matri∣mony;
Should not the Man and his Wife be
civil and just to one another, because they may
be free? That's a strange Freedom that obliges
us to be rude and disobliging.</P>
<P>NOW these Rules of Decency which, I say,
are not destroyed by Matrimony, extend to
many things even between a Man and his
Wife, which I have not yet mentioned, and
which I have with regret observed to be broken
into by some who had been better taught, and
who ought to have known by the Laws of
good Manners how to have acted after another
fort; the Branches I point at now may be
touch'd more closely, and will admit of speak∣ing
plainer <HI>English</HI> than those I have just now
mentioned, and though the Immodesty may in
many Things be as great, and that it comes
from the same corrupt, vicious Original, either
in the Man or the Woman, yet they are not
express'd in so open and so scandalous and of∣fensive
Terms.</P>
<P>THE <HI>first Case is,</HI> when either the Man or
Woman make injurious Reproaches upon one
another for natural or accidental Infirmities,
incapacitating them to answer and satisfy mu∣tual
Expectation; that is to say, to answer con∣jugal
Duties; and this more especially when
those Infirmities have not been Ante-matrime∣nial,
<PB N="70" REF="86"/>
not before Marriage, but occasioned by
Distemper or Disaster afterward, and those Di∣stempers
or Disasters such as are truly casual,
and to be honestly accounted for. There must
certainly be a great defect of Modesty in the
Man or the Woman, who can reproach the Wife
or the Husband in such a Case as this.</P>
<P>A Lady, whose Name I reflect on with disdain,
but conceal it in Charity, after having had five
fine Children by her Husband, having, tho' with
Civility too, been deny'd something which she
desired, and which he thought a little too ex∣pensive
for his Circumstances, after some warm
Words, but less criminal, turned from him with
scorn, and told him, he might let it alone since
he was grown so saving she would not ac∣cept
of it now, <HI>he might keep it for his next
Child.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gentleman had about two Years before
had a Fit of Sickness, which had brought him
very low, and by which he was grown a
little Paralitick, how it affected his natural
Powers, could not perhaps be understood so
well by any Body as by his Wife: But suppos∣ing
the worst, it was not without the utmost
Breach of Decency and Modesty, supposing
none to have been present but themselves; that
she could reproach him with that Part of it in
such a manner; but it was infinitely more so,
and she was inexcusably guilty, that she did it in
the hearing of others, and with some kind of
Additions of Banter and Raillery too, which
fat very ill upon her Tongue at that time.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Folly of it retorted exceeding∣ly
upon her Fame, and soon got into the
Months of some of her satyrical Neighbours,
who sailed not to make her very angry, I had
<PB N="71" REF="87"/>
rather I could have said ashamed, upon hearing
of it again: But it had no Effect upon her as
to her Conduct to him, nor could she refrain
doubling her Reproaches between themselves,
which her Husband, being a Man of Spirit,
resented to the highest Degree: This put an
end to all conjugal Kindness between them, and
ruined their Family-Peace, till she at length
made him her Jest, and that in Company too;
yet she got nothing by him this Way neither;
for he taking the Jest with a smile of Contempt,
as indeed it deserved, frequently answered, that
he would hire her a Journeyman, since she took
such Care to let every Body know she had Occa∣sion
for one, that if one was not enough for her,
as he thought it would not, he would provide
her two or three, that, if it were possible, she
might be satisfied, though he very much doubt∣ed
it. This was very bitter upon her, 'tis true,
but she extorted it from him; indeed till he
took this Course with her, he could by no Per∣suasions,
by no Arguments, nor by any Ways
that he could use, prevail with her to hold her
Tongue, nor indeed did those Reproaches, how∣ever
severe, put an End to it, but they went on
continually bantering and making a Jesf of
one another, and such like undecent and un∣kind
Things as these pass'd so openly, and so
often between them, that at length it occa∣sioned
a Separation for a time; and the Husband
being too hard for her, it ruined her Character
and Reputation, and though it did not her
Virtue, as those believed who had Charity for
the Lady, and I, among the rest, yet she re∣tained
the Blot of it almost as much as if she
had had the guilt, and that as long as she
lived.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="88"/>
THESE are some of the Things which Mo∣desty
and Decency forbids between a Man and
his Wife; the contrary is a Debt to conjugal
Affection on one hand, and to Laws of Decency
and good Manners on the other, both which
no matrimonial Familiarities or Intimacies can
destroy.</P>
<P>AND here give me leave to observe, though
not with the same Reflection, and without any
Satyr upon the Thing as Criminal and Immo∣dest;
that, however the matrimonial Intimacies
between a Man and his Wife, may discharge
them of much of the Bondage of Ceremony in
their Conversation, yet I can by no means
agree, that because a Woman has given her
self up to him without any reserve, all ten∣derness
and regard to her as a Woman, and all
distinction in Company should be taken away;
that she should have no respect shown to her in
whatever Circumstances she is considered, but, on
the contrary, that therefore her Husband should
treat her with Rudeness and Indecency, want
of Manners, and eyen of Respects ever after.
There are some remains certainly of the first
Civilities due to the Wife after Marriage, which
were paid to her in her distant Circumstances,
as a Maid, before, and in the time of Courtship;
and unless the Wife her self forfeit them by
any brutish disobliging Things on her Side,
they are not entirely obliterated by Matrimony,
no not to the last.</P>
<P>ON this Account, though I cannot say that a
Life of Ceremony between Man and Wife
should be recommended, yet certainly a Life
of Civility should; they say that Ceremony de∣ftroys
Affection, and, in some respects, I don't
know but it may, and when we see a Man and
<PB N="73" REF="89"/>
his Wife, however great, always bowing and
scraping and sinking to one another, we are apt
to say there's more Manners than Affection
between them.</P>
<P>BUT on the other hand, when the Husband
and Wife are so far from treating one another
with Ceremony, that they cannot keep up
common Civility, but that they treat one ano∣ther
with Disdain and Contempt, there's a cer∣tain
loss both of Affection and good Manners
too.</P>
<P>FOR this Reason I would advise all the good
Husbands and Wives that will accept that Ad∣vice,
never to mingle their Discourses, espe∣cially
before Company, with Raillery and Jest
upon one another; when a Woman once comes
to make a Jest of her Husband, she is loft, she
is gone; and when the Man makes a Jest of his
Wife he is <HI>a going,</HI> at least in my Opinion: I
shall explain the Words <HI>gone</HI> and <HI>going</HI> present∣ly;
when a Man makes a Jest of his Wife every
Body believes he hates her; when the Woman
makes a Jest of her Husband, they believe she
cuckolds him.</P>
<P>AT least 'tis a fatal Sign that all conjugal
Affection is dead and buried from between
them. I frequently visited my Friend <HI>M</HI>—,
when his Wife and he had been married about
two Years, but I was most irksomely enter∣tained
every time with his Banters and Turns
of Wit, his Sarcasms, Jests, and indeed Buf∣foonry,
all upon his Wife; I observed at first
she took it well enough, and now and then
gave him a smart return, which was not to his
Advantage; for she had a World of Wit, but
her Modesty and Sense convinced her, without
any Bodies reproof, that it was no Part for a
<PB N="74" REF="90"/>
Wife to act; that her Husband was wrong in
it, and sometimes that would fetch some Tears
from her: But she would not imitate that in
Practice which she thought so ill became her
Husband, so she bore it all as an Afflic∣tion.</P>
<P>I had in Friendship several times gently
hinted to Mr. <HI>M</HI>—, that I thought he
was too hard upon his Lady, that he knew she
was a Woman of good Breeding, and had an
uncommon share both of Wit and good Hu∣mour;
but he might easily see she was not plea∣sed
with it, and that he seemed really to oppress
her with it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, he went on, and putting one
time very hard upon something in her Beha∣viour,
which he pretended not to like, though
really without Cause; she coloured at his Words,
which shew'd she resented them, and was mov'd;
but she immediately recovered her self, and
keeping back all her Resentment, she, with an
inexpressible Goodness in her Face, and a Smile,
said to him, <HI>My Dear, you would like it in any
Body but your Wife.</HI></P>
<P>I was indeed surprized at it, but her Husband
much more; and after the Conversation was
over, he came to me eager to speak: Well, <HI>says
be,</HI> you heard what a Blow my Wife gave me;
I acknowledge she has conquered me; I should
have really liked it if it had been any one
else, and I was entirely wrong; but I'll take
your Advice, a Man should never make a com∣mon
Jest of his Wife, and I'll do it no more I
assure you.</P>
<P>I was mightily pleased to see the Effect it had
upon him; for this Humour of jesting with his
Wife, or rather making her the constant Sub∣ject
<PB N="75" REF="91"/>
of Ridicule and Jest, came up to this at
last, that she could do nothing that would please
him; but, in short, every thing that his
Wife did was to be laught at, because his Wife
was to be laught at.</P>
<P>THIS is the familiarity which the Proverb
says breed Contempt, and it does so for Men
presently jes away their Respect for their
Wives, and after that their Affection; though
Ceremony between Man and Wife lessens Af∣fection,
or rather shews it was wanting before,
yet Affection does by no means lessen Civility,
Ceremony may lessen Affection, but Disre∣spect
murthers it, strangles it. A Man can
never pretend to love his Wife and have no
Respect for her at the same time; that would be
to love her, and not to love her altogether,
which is incongruous in its Nature.</P>
<P>MIRTH between a Husband and Wife is
the heighth of Affection, but that's no Mirth
that is always running down, bantering and
playing the Buffoon with his Wife; a chearful
Affection is the Beauty of a conjugal State;
but what Chearfulness is there in making a Ban∣ter
and Jest of one another, what Mirth when
they make game, not with one another only, but
at one another.</P>
<P>IT is really an odd kind of Conversation be∣tween
a Man and his Wife, when they come
into publick Company, to have them turn
their Drollery one upon another, and run out
in Banters against themselves; the World will
not fail to make a Jest of those who first make
a Jest of themselves, and to take all the Jokes,
Turns and Returns which they pass upon one
another, to be founded upon Fact, and that
every Jest so rais'd is a true Jest; in short, 'tis a
<PB N="76" REF="92"/>
most preposterous Piece of Folly, and deserves
more Satyr than I have Room to bestow
upon it here; I may speak of it again in its
Place.</P>
<P>I knew a Couple of married Wits who fre∣quently
jested thus with one another till they
quarrelled, and indeed, it generally ended in a
Quarrel; when it was come up to its highth,
they went to their separate A partments, and
perhaps did not see one another for several
Weeks, one living at one End of the House,
and the other at t'other End; half a dozen
times a Day, or more, they would send Letters
to one another, filled with bantering bitter
Sarcasms and Satyrs, sometimes in Verse, in
Song and in Distichs, other times in Prose,
with scandalous Reproaches, filled with immo∣dest
Expressions of the vilest Sort, and not fit
to be repeated, unless I should break the
Rules I have prescribed both to my self and
others.</P>
<P>IN this manner they would sometimes
live for a Month or two together, never sparing
to give the utmost Provocation, and to re∣ceive
it with the extreamest Indignation, till
they run one another out of Breath with their
ill Usage; and then, as Storms, when they have
spent their Strength, and their Fury is abated;
it would gradually wear off, the Fire and Brim∣stone
being exhausted, they would begin to
cool again, and so come with as little Cere∣mony
to an Accommodation, as they had with
little Decency fallen out.</P>
<P>WHAT need is there of abundance of Dis∣cretion
as well as Affection between a Man and
Wife, to preserve the Rules of Decency, and
to keep up the Bounds of Modesty in their
<PB N="77" REF="93"/>
Family-Conversation? This is a Reason why
it is so essential to Matrimony, that the Per∣sons
should be Lovers as well as Relatives,
that there should be an engaged assured Affec∣tion
before there be a Political Union between
them: Without this 'tis very difficult to ren∣der
the married State a Scene of happy Cir∣cumstances,
and a Condition truly calculated
for humane Society; but of that also in its
Order, for I must give you a whole Chapter
upon that Head.</P>
<P>JUSTICE is another of the Particulars which
Decency still requires between a Man and his
Wife; he is far from acting decently with a
Wife that will not on all Occasions do her Jus∣tice:
To be injurious to a Wife destroys all Fa∣mily-Peace
between them; and whether this
Injustice be occasioned by and relating to Mat∣ters
of Property? or Matters of Duty, 'tis all
the same; there is no Decency can be preserved
where Justice is not done; if the Wife he op∣pressed,
if her Right and Allowances expresly
capitulated for are unjustly detained from her,
or if she be any way stript, either of her Orna∣ments,
or of her Settlements, these are inju∣rious
things which destroy Affection, and the
destroying of Affection ruins the Peace of
the Family.</P>
<P>BUT I am a little gone beyond my Subject,
which relates only to personal Virtue, and the
Reserves which Modesty still makes necessary
between a Man and his Wife; and there are
some Things even of that kind which still re∣main.
It is true, some of them are such as
cannot bear the mentioning without Breach of
the Modesty which I am speaking to protect,
and breaking into those Bounds which I re∣solve
<PB N="78" REF="94"/>
not to offend against: Other Things may
be so explained as to be understood by those,
especially to whom they belong, for the guilty
will see the Arrow shot at them which others
cannot perceive.</P>
<P>THE Indecencies and Immodesties of the
Tongue deserve a Place here, and I insist that,
even between a Man and his Wife, there are
due Bounds to be observed in both these, especi∣ally
when they speak not only to, but of one
another in the hearing of others.</P>
<P>THERE is a Modesty of the Tongue which
never forsakes a Woman of Virtue, no not in
her most intimate conversing with her own
Husband, but much more at other times; all
Breaches of this kind touch even her Virtue it
self, and are Branches of that which I call
conjugal Lewdness, which is to be carefully
avoided among Christians.</P>
<P>NOR is the Man exempted from this Modesty
of the Tongue, not only with his Wife, but
especially when of or to his Wife before Com∣pany:
Nothing is more unworthy a modest
and Christian Man than to talk lewdly of, or to
his Wife before Company; a Man ought never
to force Blushes from his Wife on account of
their own Privacies and Intimacies; this is to
make those Things criminal which in them∣selves
are lawful. I know not any one Thing
that sits worse upon a Man's Tongue than to
laugh at, jeer, and flout his Wife with what
had pass'd between them in their retired Con∣versations,
and this before other People; 'tis
the most odious, hateful, and, to a modest Ear,
nauseous, of all Discourse, and yet nothing is
more frequent, and even among People of Fi∣gure
too, which, I must confess, I have often
<PB N="79" REF="95"/>
wondered at, considering the Pretences we now
make to polite Conversation.</P>
<P>BESIDES, 'tis a Breach of Decency as it re∣spects
his Wife of the vilest and most scanda∣lous
kind, and if she is a modest and virtuous
Woman, as well as a good Wife, is sufficient to
make her abhor his Society, and to refuse to
appear in Company with him, even in his own
House, nay, and if continued, will not fail in
time to make her hate him, which is the worst
Condition an honest Man can ever wish to be
in with a Wife.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed 'tis a wife Man's Bu∣finess
after Matrimony, by all means possi∣ble
to preserve the Affection of his Wife en∣tire,
to engross her to him, and to make and
keep himself the single and entire Object of
her best Thoughts. If she is once brought to
hate him, to have an aversion to him, to loath
and abhor him, she must have an uncom∣mon
Stock of Virtue, and be more a Christian
than he ought to expect of her, if she does not
single out some other Object of her Affection;
and can a Man think his Wife, who is thus
every Day disobliged, in the grossest manner
ill used, and, in spite of her Resentments,
exposed to be laught at by him, will long pre∣serve
an inviolable Affection to him; but I
may touch this again.</P>
<P>I return to the Subject. There are yet
greater Offences against Modesty than these;
As I said above, that giving unjust Retorts,
and making unkind and indecent Reproaches
in case of casual or accidental Weakness and
Impotence, are scandalous Breaches of Mode∣sty
between a Man and his Wife. So be∣sides
this, there are yet a numberless Variety
<PB N="80" REF="96"/>
of Violences, as I may call them, committed,
likes Rapes upon Nature, in which nothing is
more frequent than for a Husband to press a
Wife to such and such Things as Morality and
Modesty forbids.</P>
<P>THIS is highly injurious to the conjugal Af∣fection,
and exposes the Person guilty to a just
Censure, nay, even to the Censure mentioned
of <HI>Matrimonial Whoredom:</HI> Whether these Ex∣cesses
or Violences consist in Negatives, or in
Affirmatives, they are in their kind equally cri∣minal.</P>
<P>IT must be confessed that Language is want∣ing
here, and Words cannot fully express the
meaning, so as to preserve the Decency I pro∣fess;
and I may be asked what I mean when I
cannot explain it, not for want of knowing my
own meaning, but for want of Words to express
it; and therefore, as above, I choose to be silent,
I'll come as near the Case as I can without giv∣ing
offence, and what cannot be said with De∣cency
must be omitted; I had said, that perso∣nal
Weaknesses and Infirmities on either Side
ought not to be retorted between a Man and
his Wife, much less exposed, so I now say, they
much less ought to be oppress'd on that Account.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I am speaking now, not of natural and
original Impotencies, which, being before Mar∣riage,
ought to have been discovered, and which
our Law makes sufficient to dissolve the Con∣tract,
and separate the Persons.</P>
<P>THERE has been foul Work enough made
with these Things in print by particular, lewd,
and obscene Publications, which modest Ears
are sick of, and the Nation mourns for the Of∣fence
of it; but my Discourse looks quite ano∣ther
Way.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="97"/>
BESIDES, our Office of Matrimony so∣lemnly
charges and adjures the Persons who
come to be joined together, that if they know
any such Impediments they should declare
them at that time; and, in a manner, protests
against the Validity of the Marriage in Case of
a failure, and therefore and from that very
Protest, such Marriages are afterwards fre∣quently
made void by Parliament.</P>
<P>BUT as the Subject of my Observation is
more nice, so it is also more modest, and may
with more decency be considered of. The In∣firmities
on either Side which human Body is
subject to are many; I distinguish them not here,
only that I profess to mean such Infirmities as
regard the Sexes only, Physicians, <HI>Acouchers</HI> or
Surgeons, and Anatomists understand, and can
describe them; 'tis none of my Business, much
less my Design.</P>
<P>IT frequently does, or at least may happen,
that when a young Couple come together their
Constitutions may, as too often their Tempers
may and do, differ from one another, with re∣spect
to these Things, to the greatest Extreme;
one is weak, faint, the Spirits low, Nature un∣able
to answer what is expected; <HI>another</HI> per∣haps
is reduced by Child-bearing, too thick and
and too long together, by Accidents in often
hard and difficult Travels, Injuries received by
unskilful Hands, or many other Incidents
and Circumstances not to be named; by these,
I say, the Person is reduced, debilitated, and
render'd unfit to give the Satisfaction which
has formerly been found: On the other hand,
the Man is reduced by a tedious, lingring de∣cay,
which Physicians call a Consumption; or
by other acute Distempers, which he can, as is
<PB N="82" REF="98"/>
said before, account for without Scandal; and
to which Men are as frequently subject, and as
much disabled by them, as Women are in the
Cases mentioned just now; such as Stone, Gout,
Palfies, Epilepsies, Rheumaticks, Dropsies, and
such like.</P>
<P>IF either or any of these Circumstances in
Man or Woman happens, where they are joined
respectively to another that is strong, ro∣bust,
in perfect vigour, the Spirits high, the
Blood hot, and perhaps boiling, Nature for∣ward,
and craving Desire unsatisfied; I need
go no farther to explain it; What wretched
Work does this cause between the ill-match'd
Couple? I can openly say I know a beautiful
young Lady after bringing her Husband several
Children, yet actually destroyed, I might have
said murthered, by these conjugal Violences,
to say no worse of them; and I make no dis∣ference
'tis the same on the other Side; ma∣ny
a Man sinks under the Weight of his own
Deficiencies; he is ashamed to decline the Duty
of the Marriage-bed, disdains to be thought
unable to satisfy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I can go no farther, and the Reader will ex∣cuse
the Interruption. I refer you to a stated
and acknowledged Declaration in the Case,
and which is direct to my purpose; and tho' it
is among the <HI>Turks,</HI> yet the reason of the Prac∣tice
is not the less or the more. The <HI>Turks</HI>
think this very Case, whether of the Man's
Side or the Woman's, to be so weighty, as that
it deserve the interposition of Authority;
The Grand Visier in Person, where he can be
applied to, and in more extraordinary Cases
hears the Causes himself; in other Cases
the graver <HI>Kadeleschers,</HI> and Judges determine
<PB N="83" REF="99"/>
it; where both the Man and Wife are fully exa∣mined,
and Judgment given as the Circum∣stances
require. I am assured also, that Judgment
is given in those Cases, not in a ludicrous manner
with game and sport, and a Court, or rather
Croud, standing round, to laugh and make a jest
either of one Side or other; but with a solemn
Gravity, suitable at least to the Dignity of the
Judge who passes the Sentence, and to the Re∣verence
which both Sides pay to the Laws
themselves.</P>
<P>NOR is the Method wholly <HI>Turkish,</HI> and to
be objected against as a Piece of <HI>Mahometan</HI>
Original; but 'tis founded upon the antient
usage of all the Eastern Countries, in whose
Customs it is to be found, though with some
Variation, even as far back as the <HI>Phenician</HI> and
<HI>Carthaginian</HI> Empires, and as the <HI>Egyptian</HI> and
<HI>Persian</HI> Government and Monarchies. Hence
the Phrase made use of in the Scripture by the
Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> called <HI>Due Benevolence,</HI> on one
hand is commanded; while on the other hand
<HI>Chambering and Wantonness,</HI> which is suppos'd
to relate to the pretended lawful Intimacies
between a Man and his Wife are forbidden.</P>
<P>IT may be expected I should explain my
self upon those Scripture Expressions and there
is sufficient room for it, and that with decency
too; but I resolve not to come to the brink of
the Offence, nor shall the Reader be able to
say, I go all the length I might go.</P>
<P>THE Scripture Expressions are expounded by
the Reverend and Learned Annotators, and to
them I refer; and as to the Courts of Justice
under the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> deciding such Cases as
these, where Complaints are made by either
Sex, I could give large Accounts of them, but
<PB N="84" REF="100"/>
they would break in upon me in the grand
Difficulty, and offend the Reader; except a
Sort who I am not at this time about to please.
Here therefore you must allow me to omit a
large and, in its kind, useful Part of the De∣sign
it self, namely, the Reproof of scandalous
Violences on both Sides even in the Marriage
Intimacies, which cannot be spoken of with
Decency, and therefore must go unreproved.
One would hope it is a sufficient Reproof to
those who understand what I mean.</P>
<P>WE are but too forward to say, that no one
ought to prohibit what GOD has not prohibited;
that what is lawful may lawfully be done, where
Nature dictates, <HI>say they,</HI> and Heaven has not
forbid, what can be pretended, that the Rule of
Modesty is express'd by Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> thus:
<Q>“By Nature prompted, by no Law deny'd,”</Q></P>
<P>THAT all things within that Compass are
to be allowed, and to restrain farther, is to bind
heavy Burthens, which we will not bear our
selves.</P>
<P>BUT my answer is short, where-ever an
unrestrained Liberty seems to be given, yet
we ought to remember that GOD gave his Laws
to us as to reasonable Creatures, not as to
Brutes; that we are to act in no Cases out of
the Bounds of Reason and Justice, no nor of
Modesty and Decency; if the Circumstances of
it seem to be left to our Discretion, that Dis∣cretion
should be limited by our reasoning
Powers; if the Man or Woman, for I speak of,
and to both, will tell me, that in the Extafies
of their Passion, or Affection, or Appetite, or
call it what you will, they are at liberty to
<PB N="85" REF="101"/>
lay aside the use of Reason, and act unlike a
Man, or a Christian, or even a Brute; that he
is to be a Fury, outrageous, unsatisfied, and
entirely out even of his own Government;
That he or she is to lay aside all Considerations
for the <HI>she</HI> or <HI>be</HI> they are concerned withal; all
compassion for Circumstances, Infirmities, Weak∣ness,<HI>&amp;c.</HI> of whatsoever kind, or proceeding
from whatsoever Cause; that they are at liberty
thus to be furious, and to act meerly in gratifi∣cation
of their own Pleasures, without any
other or better Consideration, and to do what∣ever
they think fit in the pursuit of their pre∣sent
gust of Appetite, even to the ruin and
destruction of the Husband or Wife; I say, if
this can be made appear to be just, then I am
answered.</P>
<P>BUT if not, then Reason, and Modesty, and
Virtue ought to be listened to; and the cravings
of Nature, if they are extravagant, should be
governed by the Rules which Nature is sub∣jected
to. The thing is a Disease and a Dis∣temper
in it self, and though it may be called
Constitution and Nature, 'tis a mistake; 'tis
not Constitution, but a Plague in the Constitu∣tion;
'tis a kind of Fever or Calenture in the
Blood; 'tis, in a word, to carry it no farther, a
Frenzy in the Creature; whether in the Head
or elsewhere, is not to the purpose, but such it
is; and they ought to apply to Art, I mean
Physick, to abate the Acrimony of their Blood,
restrain the Excesses of high feeding, hard
drinking, and luxurious living; reducing
themselves at least so, as to bring under the
Flesh; bring Nature under the Government of
Reason, and, in short, bring the Body under the
<PB N="86" REF="102"/>
command of the Soul, for that is the whole
Case.</P>
<P>I might give some Examples of this Mode∣ration
as it has been happily practised among
Christians in our Age, and that even among Men
of the highest Rank, and above the Restraint of
Laws. Take one particular Relation which I
had from an unquestionable Author, that is to
say, from a grave Minister who had been con∣versant
in the very Houshold, and the Truth
of whose Relation I cannot doubt. “There
was a certain reigning Prince not long ago
alive in the World; I do not say there are
many such left, who after having had five
Sons, and most of them Men of Fame as
well as high Birth, and still living, had this
particular Circumstance attending his Mar∣riage-bed;
his Princess was reduced to such
Weakness, by frequent Child-bearing, that
she was not able to receive the Embraces of
her Lord without the utmost Extremity of
Pain and Disorder; and it went so far, that
she was <HI>at last</HI> obliged to discover it to him,
but did it with so much Modesty and Goodness,
that she offered him to consent to his tak∣ing
any other Lady, which he might approve
of to supply her Place.</P>
<P>SHE insisted upon the reasonableness of
it, and that she believed her consenting to it,
and from such evident necessity, might make
it lawful; nay, she press'd the Prince to it
very earnestly, offering her self to find out
an agreeable Person for him, and to bring
her to him.</P>
<P>THE generous Prince received her first De∣claration;
intimating her own Weakness and
<PB N="87" REF="103"/>
Infirmity, with a concern of Pity and Af∣fection
as became a tender Husband, which
he always had been to her, and assured her
he would not oppress her, or offer any thing
to injure or disorder her. He smiled at her
Proposal, but told her, No; since Providence
had thought fit to deny him the satisfaction
he used to have in the Embraces of his own
Wife, he hoped he was so much of a Chri∣stian
as not to break GoD's Laws to gratify
natural Desires; and that he had so much
the Government of himself also as not to
let his Appetite get the Mastery of his Rea∣son;
and with this noble Resolution declined
the Offer his Wife made him of another
Lady, and kept himself single, <HI>as it may be
called,</HI> to the lady last.</P>
<P>I give this, among many Examples, wherein
conjugal Modesty has been preserved, and the
Example is moving. The Prince I mention
was in the highth of his Strength, the prime
of his Age, between the Age of thirty and
forty; strong, vigorous, full of Fire in the
Field, and, in proportion, elsewhere; the
Thing was an Accident, and to Nature was
doubtless a Disappointment; but the Christian
prevailed above the Youth; Reason conquered
Nature, and that Reason had the Government of
all his Inclinations.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY we are to act according to our
Reason and our Understanding in all Cases,
where the Laws either of GOD or Man leave
us at liberty; nay, those Laws seeming to
leave us at full liberty, give the stronger Force
to the Government of our Reason; They
seem not to say you are in this lest to what
your own Will directs, but the Language of the
<PB N="88" REF="104"/>
Law of Nature it self, and of the subsequent
Laws of GOD in the same Case is. Here you
are lest to act as Reason and Religion shall di∣rect,
and as the Circumstances that may hap∣pen
shall make reasonable.</P>
<P>THE Excesses and Extremes of our Passions
are in almost all Cases the scandal of the
rational Life, the principal Cause of which
is, because Reason is given to Man as a guard
to him against all the Exorbitances of Nature.
Reason is the Rule of Life to a Man, as Religi∣on
is to Christians; he that is not guided by
the last is an Infidel, as he that is not governed
by the first is a Brute. 'Tis a shame to a Man
that wears about him a Soul, to say, that he is
not guided by his Reason; as 'tis a shame to a
Christian to say, he is not guided by the Prin∣ciples
and Dictates of Religion.</P>
<P>AS Reason therefore is our guide in Matters
subjected to its Laws, so in this more particularly,
namely, in governing and directing our Affec∣tions,
our Appetites, our Passions, and our Desires:
Take it in more indifferent and ordinary Cases,
we are allowed to Eat and Drink, GOD gave
the Blessings and Encrease of the Field to Man;
He is, under his Maker, the Lord of the
World, and he is left at full liberty not only
to supply his Necessity, his Hunger and Thirst,
but he is at liberty to solace himself with his
Food, and eat or drink what is most agreeable
to his Palate: But as Reason is the guide of his
Appetite, so far as to direct him how much to
eat or drink upon all Occasions, so he that
gorges himself beyond what is reasonable, ex∣poses
himself to the just Censure of a brutal
Appetite; thus, in all <HI>other Cases,</HI> a Man out
<PB N="89" REF="105"/>
of the government of his Reason is, in a word,
a Monster rather than a Man.</P>
<P>METHINKS the modest Reader may take this
as it is intended, <HI>viz.</HI> to extend to the Exercise of
a brutal ungoverned Appetite, in any other Case,
to which this of eating and drinking is apposite,
and may apply it suitably, though Decency
forbids me to do it.</P>
<P>WE should all blush to be told, in other Cases,
that we had no Government of our selves; that
we were insatiably Covetous, or unboundedly
Ambitious, or Vain, and much more should
we have reason to blush, as being insatiable in
any other Appetite.</P>
<P>DECENCY also puts another Difficulty upon
me here, <HI>viz.</HI> it obliges me to speak of this
Article, as if the Man was the only guilty Per∣son,
and that the Modesty of the Woman was
a sufficient restraint to her upon all Occasions:
Nor will I make so much as an attempt in Pre∣judice
of that Charity; if it happen otherwise
on any Occasion 'tis so much the worse, be∣cause,
I think, of the two, the Extream on
that Side is the most fatal, as well as shame∣ful.</P>
<P>THERE is a Part of this Circumstance, which,
as it is necessary to be mentioned, so it may
be mentioned without Offence, tho' it regards
even the nicest Branch of the Argument; and
that is, How fatal this Exorbitance is, when it
meets, not as it were in a kind of Conjunction,
as where neither the Man or the Woman have
the Government of themselves; but where the
Extream is on one Side only, with a coldness
and indifferency equally extream on the other;
I say, this may be mentioned without offence,
because it must not be deny'd but there is an
<PB N="90" REF="106"/>
Error both ways, of which Reason as well as
Duty and Affection, are to be the Directors
and Guides: It is, no doubt, a Duty on
both Sides to yield, to please, and oblige
one another, where no just Objections are to be
made; and those Husbands or Wives who de∣cline
one another criminally, ought to consider
the matrimonial Vow and Duty in all its Par∣ticulars;
but especially upon the ill Conse∣quences
which such a Coldness may produce;
which, though not justiable at all in the Per∣son
that may so fly out, yet 'tis what we ought
to avoid, as we are not to lead one another into
Temptations; and this is one of the Things
which, as I said, those Courts of particular Jus∣tice
take cognisance of among the <HI>Turks.</HI> But
of this more at large in its Order. I am now
chiefly talking of the Extreams of the first
kind, and of an unrestrained Brutality.</P>
<P>I bury all the hatesul Particulars which these
Reproofs are pointed at, in the respect I pre∣serve
for decency of Expression; and conclude
with saying, that those Branches of conjugal
Disorder are the scandal of the Marriage Bed;
every Christian, as well as every prudent
and wise Man, will be ashamed, to think he
should want a hint to restrain himself. As to
the brutal World; Men and Women who give
a loose to their Desires, of whatever kind, and
hate all Mortifications; who despise Reftraint
and Rules; that scorn to think they want Ad∣vice,
and are above Reproof; I have one Hint
more for such, and that is this, let them go on and
act with a full Gust; let them strain Nature to the
utmost; and let them see whether if the Laws of
GOD or Man do not restrain them or punish
them, Nature her self will not complain, openly
<PB N="91" REF="107"/>
expose them, and make them confess the Crime
when it is to be read in their Punishment.</P>
<P>WHENCE come Palsies and Epilepsies, Fal∣ling-Sickness,
trembling of the Joints, pale
dejected Aspects, Leanness, and at last Rotten∣ness,
and other filthy and loathsome Diftem∣pers,
but from the criminal Excesses of their
younger times? 'Tis not enough to say that it
was lawful, and they made use of none but their
own Wives; the natural Course of things go on
their own way; Nature's Streams flow all in the
same Channels; if the Fountain is drawn dry, if
the Vitals are exhausted, the Engines of Nature
worked with unreasonable Violence, the Parts
feel the same unreasonable Force, and the Con∣sequences
will be the same, whether the Facts
were juftifiable, and lawful in themselves or not.</P>
<P>THUS, as above, 'tis lawful to eat and drink;
and the Kinds and Quantities of Food which
we are to eat are perfectly left to our own Dis∣cretion;
nay, we are left, as I have said, even
to regale and divert our selves both with Eat∣ing
and Drinking. But the Epicure, who gives
himself all manner of Liberties, that gives a
loose to the gust of his Appetite, that gorges
his Stomach with rich Sauces and surfeiting
Dainties, that rather devours than feeds upon
what is before him, and knows no Bounds to
his eating but the meer mathematical Dimen∣sions
of his Bowels: What comes of him?
He swells up with Fat, is over-run with Rheums,
Catarrhs, and all scorbutick Distempers, and at
last finks under the Weight of his own Bulk,
is choaked with the very Food he eats, and dies
in the middle of his dainty Meats: and the
Drunkard, gorged with Wine, does the same.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="108"/>
THUS they destroy themselves in the use of
lawful Things, or, if you please, in the abuse
of them; and while they please themselves
with having been doing nothing but what it
was lawful to do, they perish in the Excesses of
it, and murther themselves by the unlawful
doing of lawful Actions.</P>
<P>IN the same manner, those Men who pretend
there are no limitations of Modesty between
a Man and his Wife, that their Reason is
not needful to be called in to the Government
of their Appetite, but that they are at liberty
to act in all Things as meer ungoverned Na∣ture,
however vitiated, shall direct. What Ef∣fects
do they ordinarily find of it, and where
does it end? How do we find them loaded with
Diseases, contract early Infirmities? How does
exhausted Nature seel the secret Defects, and
how hard do they find it to recover the Vigour
and Strength which they have push'd to the ut∣most,
in a thoughtless Excess?</P>
<P>NAY, How often does the boiling Blood fer∣ment
into Fevers, Ulcers, and the most incura∣ble
Diseases? How do the vital Parts feel the
Wound, till the Dart strike through the Liver,
as <HI>Solomon</HI> most excellently describes it; and the
dismal Consequences seldom End but in the
Grave? Nor is that all, but the tottering Head,
the Rheums, Catarrhs, the Fluxes, Inflamma∣tions,
and all the fatal Consequences of an un∣governed
vitiated Youth, how often and generally
do they appear so openly, that'tis easy, especially
to Men of Judgment, to read the Cause in the
Consequences, the Sin in the Punishments
nay, some will tell you, that even the foul Dis∣ease
it self, has been the Effect of immoderate
Heats and Surfeitings of the Blood, without
<PB N="93" REF="109"/>
what we call Contamination or Infection from
others, and where none other has been con∣cerned
but the Man and his Wife singly and
alone.</P>
<P>IF I were at liberty to explain myself upon
this nauseous Subject, I could, from clear and
rational Consequences, convince the ungoverned
Criminal, how he lays the Foundation of the ruin
of his Conftitution, how he poisons his Blood, and
spreads the corrupt Seeds of Disease into the very
Veins of his Posterity; but the Occasion is too foul
for my Pen: Let it suffice to admonish Chriftians,
and Men of Sense, that they should remember
they are so; that they have reasoning Pow∣ers
to assist them in subduing their inordinate
Heats; that they should summon Virtue and
Modesty, Reason and Chriftianity to their aid,
and act in all Things agreeable to reasonable
Beings, not like enraged Lunaticks, though
they are not under the restraint of Laws.</P>
<P>THEY are greatly mistaken likewise who
expect I should give Rules here, and prescribe to
them what I mean by Modefty and Moderation
in such Things as these; in short, such would
please themselves if they could bring me to
enter into Particulars of any kind, on one Side
or other, for they love to dwell upon the Story.
But <HI>Verb. Sap. Sat.</HI> 'Tis enough; I have pointed
out the Crime as far as Decency will permit,
the Bounds are easily prescribed, so as a
common Understanding may reach them;
Reason will tell you where the Limits are
to be placed between lawful and unlawful;
<HI>as follows,</HI> namely,</P>
<P>No Violences upon Nature on one Side or
another; no pushing the Constitution to Extre∣mities,
no earnest Importunities, no immodest
<PB N="94" REF="110"/>
Promptings; let all that Nature dictates be
free, spontaneous, voluntary and temperate,
so Vigour is preserved, Affection encreased,
and Abilities too, for it was a significant Ex∣pression
of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham's,</HI> in a
Poem of his call'd <HI>The Enjoyment,</HI>
<Q>Love makes Men able as their Hearts are kind.</Q></P>
<P>'Tis certain, all Intemperance, all outrage∣ous
Excesses, debilitate and exhaust the Spirits,
weaken Nature, and render the Person unfit for
many of the Offices of Life, besides the same
Article; whereas a moderate use of Nature's
Liberties have quite contrary Effects.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the absolute Necessity of a mutual Af∣fection

to the Happiness of a married State,
and of the Scandal of marrying without it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>ARRIAGE is a state of Union,
and the strictest of its Kind that
can not only be found, but that
can be conceived of among Men.
<HI>Adam</HI> emphatically expresses it,
when GOD brought the Woman
to him; <HI>This is now Bone of my Bone, and Flesh
of my Flesh,</HI> Gen. xi. 23. and again, verse 24.
<HI>and they shall be one Flesh.</HI></P>
<P>SO solemn the Institution, so simple the
Construction, so salt the Bond, so loose the
Persons bound! It would be much too serious for
the reading of these Times to enter into a Dis∣sertation
upon the solemn Engagement, and
upon the Weight and Significance of the Obli∣gation
on both Sides, how firm the Bond, how
indissolvible the mutual Ties, and how impor∣tant
to the Felicity of Life it is that they should
be religiously observed.</P>
<P>I know too well who I am talking to, and
at what Time of Day; how the Subordina∣tion
<PB N="96" REF="112"/>
of one Sex is laughed at and bantered, and
the Dominion of the other abused and turned
into Tyranny, and Oppression; how the Wo∣men,
instead of Submission, reign; and the Men,
instead of a Government in Love, and a supe∣riority
of Affection, in which that Government
should chiefly consist, insult and oppress their
Wives; how the Obligation of forsaking all
other, is ridiculed and made a Jest of, and that
of keeping your self only unto her, declared
to be a meer Church Imposition, a Piece of
Priestcraft, and unreasonable.</P>
<P>Do you think, says blushing <HI>G</HI>—, to his
poor subjected but modest Wife, Do you think
that ever I intended to meddle with no more
than one Woman? No, no, I never promis'd
any such Thing; if I did I never intended to
keep to it, then he turns and sings a scandalous
Song out of <HI>Rochester,</HI> too gross to repeat:
<Q><L>But to live with her all a Man's Life,</L>
<L>Till she grows—</L>
<L>Good faith, <HI>Mr. Parson,</HI> I thank you for that,</L>
<L>I thank ye for that.</L></Q></P>
<P>AND whence comes this Contempt? I say,
it does not proceed so much from the Wicked∣ness,
as from the Ignorance of the Age; Ig∣norance
of the real Felicity of their very Kind;
how all that can be called happy in the Life of
Man, is summ'd up in the state of Marriage;
that it is the Center to which all the lesser De∣lights
of Life tend, as a Point in the Circle;
that, in short, all the extraordinary Enjoy∣ments
of Life are temporary and trifling, and
consist chiefly in the strange and uncouth Plea∣sure
<PB N="97" REF="113"/>
which, some Men say, they find in doing
what they ought not to do; which, at best, lasts
but till they are wise, and learn to know what
it is to repent. But the Pleasure of a married
State consists wholly in the Beauty of the Union,
the sharing Comforts, the doubling all Enjoy∣ments;
'tis the Settlement of Life; the Ship is
always in a Storm till it finds this safe Road,
and here it comes to an Anchor: 'Tis the want
of a taste of Life makes Men despise that Part of
it which Heaven at first constituted to compleat
the Happiness of his Creatures.</P>
<P>TO argue against Marriage, because so many
Matches are unhappy, and so few exemplify the
Case as it ought to be, is only arguing the Ignorance
and Corruption of Mankind, which as it is the
Cause, so it is fully discovered by this unhappy
Consequence. Did Men expect Happiness in a
married Condition, they would Begin and End
it after another manner, prepare for it before∣hand
with more nicety, and take much great∣er
Thought about it before they engaged in
it.</P>
<P>POLITICK Matches are Weddings for Prin∣ces,
and for Persons of high Birth, where the
meer Interests of the Families are the Conside∣ration
of the Alliance, and where it is not es∣sential
to the Match, whether the Persons love
one another or no, at least not so essential as in
Persons of a meaner degree.</P>
<P>BUT as the Persons of a lower Station are,
generally speaking, much more happy in their
Marrriages, than Princes and Persons of Distin∣ction;
so I take much of it, if not all of it, to
consist in the Advantage they have to choose
and refuse.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="114"/>
MARRIAGES of Princes and Persons of
Rank, are rather Leagues and Treaties of Al∣liance
and Confederacy than Weddings, and
they are transacted accordingly; the Lady is
courted at a Distance, viewed in Effigy by her
Picture set with Diamonds, contracted by En∣voys
Extraordinary, married by Proxy, and
then travels a thousand Miles perhaps, or
something less, to find out her Husband.</P>
<P>THUS indeed <HI>Abraham</HI> sent the Steward of
his Houshold to fetch his Son <HI>Isaac</HI> a Wife, a∣bout
three or four hundred Miles off, and she
came with the Messenger: But the Case was
plain there; <HI>Rebecca</HI> saw the visible Finger of
GOD in it, and the Words of <HI>Laban</HI> her Bro∣ther,
though himself an Idolater, confessed it,
<HI>Gen.</HI> xxiv. 50. <HI>then Laban and Bethuel answered,
and said, the thing proceedeth from the</HI> LORD,
<HI>we cannot speak unto thee bad or good;</HI> and upon
this Foundation the Lady ventured to go with
the Messenger.</P>
<P>BUT yet even <HI>Rebeccah</HI> herself, when she
acted the like Part for her Son, and desired to
take a Wife for <HI>Jacob</HI> from the same Country;
she sent no Servant of the Errand, but made
him go in Person, and choose for himself, and
he did so, and pitched upon his well-favoured
beautiful <HI>Rachel,</HI> had not <HI>Laban</HI> cheated him,
and laid a blear-eyed <HI>Lea</HI> in her Place.</P>
<P>AS Marriage is a state of Life in which so
much of humane Felicity is really placed, and
in which Men may be so compleatly happy or
miserable, it seems to me the most rational
thing in the World, that the Parties themselves,
and them alone, should give the last Strokes to
its Conclusion; that they only should be left to
determine it, and that with all possible Freedom,
<PB N="99" REF="115"/>
that they might be able to say to one another,
and that with the utmost Sincerity, at reciting
the Office of Matrimony, not <HI>I take thee,</HI> but <HI>I
choose thee;</HI> thou art my Choice; that the Man
may be able say, not only she is the Wife of
my Youth, but she is the Wife of my Affection;
and the Woman the same.</P>
<P>HOW little is this which is the essential Part
understood in the World, how little of Love
is there to be found in Matrimony, as 'tis now
managed; and what is the Consequence but un∣faithful
performing the Marriage Convenants;
disloyalty, breach of Faith and Honour, and
the worst Sort of Perjury on both Sides? for as
the Marriage Covenant is a solemn of all Engagements
upon Earth, so breaking it is the worst of Per∣jury,
and ought indeed to be punished as
such.</P>
<P>WHERE there is no Pre-engagement of the
Affection before Marriage, what can be ex∣pected
after it? And what do we find comes
after it, but <HI>at best</HI> continued Jars, Quarrel∣lings,
Scolding, and perhaps Fighting? never
to be abated, never to be altered, no not by
length of Time, not forty Years wedlock has
been sufficient to tire out the jangling, ill∣matched
Tempers; but the Evil takes Root
with Time, till the Hatred grows riveted, and
becomes natural, they even die with the per∣petual
Disgust upon them, and carry their
Feuds, as it were, along with them to the
Grave, as if they resolved to renew the Strife
in the next World.</P>
<P>IT was a miserable Example of this which a
near Relation of mine was an Eye-witness to in
the Town of <HI>Sherborn</HI> in <HI>Dorsctshire,</HI> or very
<PB N="100" REF="116"/>
near it. A Man and his Wife had lived a
wretched, continued Life of Contention for
almost fifty Years; at length the Woman fell
sick and died; while she lay on her Death-bed
her Husband came up into the Chamber to see
her, as a good Husband ought; the Woman
fretful, though sick, found fault with him upon
some Occasion of no great moment, and grew
angry. Pray, my Dear, says the Man, don't
quarrel to your last Moment. The Woman
flew into a Passion that he should suggest it
was her last Moment, which, she said, <HI>he did
not know.</HI> This put the Man into a Passion too,
and he said, <HI>rashly enough,</HI> that if it was not
her last Moment he wished it was, or it would
be happy for him if it was, or to that purpose.
What! says she, do you Insult me with that,
depend upon it you shall be at no Quiet on that
Account, for if ever the Dead can come to the
Quick, I'll be with thee again.</P>
<P>WHETHER she kept her Word with him or
no, I know not; but 'tis certain she died in
two or three Days after, nor did the Man ven∣ture
to go up to visit her any more. This was
indeed carrying on what we may call an eternal
Feud, it was a mortal Breach indeed, for no∣thing
ever cur'd it, and yet the Couple were
not so exasperated against one another, but that
they lived together, were People of good Sub∣stance,
and some Sense, and even too much
Wit; but married, it seems, without the grand
constituting Article called mutual Affection,
which is indeed, in my Opinion, the essential
Part of the Contract; the Woman profess'd she
never loved him, and yet she married him; the
Man declared he never asked her to love him,
or cared one Farthing whether she did or no,
<PB N="101" REF="117"/>
so he had but her Money, which was, it seems,
what he took her for. Now, was this Matrimony?
No, no, it might be Marriage, but I deny that
it was Matrimony; here was nothing of <HI>GOD's
holy Ordinance,</HI> or taking one another according
to that Ordinance; it was all a contradiction of
the main Design; in short, it was a something
that wants a Name; and what can be said to
contradict me if I should call it a <HI>Matrimonial
Whoredom?</HI></P>
<P>WELL might this Couple answer or say after
the Parson, I <HI>N.</HI> TAKE thee <HI>N.</HI> But they could
never have been married if the Office had run,
I <HI>N.</HI> choose thee <HI>N.</HI> out of my sincere Affection
to thee, and for that Reason take thee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> What
would have become of us all if this had been
the solemn Part or Oath of the Marriage Co∣venant,
and that it had been taken upon Pain of
Perjury? How few are there that would dare to
be married upon that Foot?</P>
<P>SOME are of the Opinion, prudential Match∣es,
as they call them, are best. They tell us,
'tis the Parents business to choose Wives for
their Sons, and Husbands for their Daughters;
that let them be tied together first, they will
toy together till they love afterwards; that Pro∣perty
begets Affection, and that if all other
Things hit, they may run the risque of the
Love with less incovenience.</P>
<P>BUT I must enter my Protest here: I think
they that make a Toy of the Affection, will make
a Toy of the Matrimony; they seem to know
little of the Misery of those Matches who
think they are to be toyed into Love after Con∣summation:
how often are they cloyed with
one another's Company before the Affection
comes in? How little Force has the sport of Mar∣riage,
<PB N="102" REF="118"/>
(so a wise Favourer of those prudential
Matches was pleased to call it) in to contract
Affection? I have seen enough of it, to make
me venture saying, there is not One in Ten of
those Kinds of Marriages that succeeds.</P>
<P>NOR is the Surface-Love, which takes so
much in the World at this time, any part of
the pure, the solid, the rivetted Affection,
which, I insist, is so essential to the Felicity
of a married Life. Where is the Union of the
whole Desire, or even of the Soul of Desire,
that which Mr. Milton so very nobly expatiates
upon from <HI>Adams,</HI> Words, <HI>They shall be one Flesh,</HI>
Gen. xi. 24.</P>
<P><Q>“And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soul.”</Q>
Is this to be obtained after Marriage, and that
Marriage made perhaps by the choice and at the
imperious arbitrary Command of Superiors?
If not, as indeed I think it not rational to
imagine, is it so slight a Matter, and of so
little Consequence, as that Matrimony should
be ventured on without a due Provision for such
a Union? Certainly, if any Action of Life is
of Consequence, 'tis that which determines the
Man for Happiness or Misery: And such is
this of Matrimony; for I think I may affirm,
Marriage without Love, is the compleatest
Misery in Life. Besides, I must say, it is to
me utterly unlawful, and entails a Curse upon
the Persons, as being wilfully perjured, invok∣ing
the Name of GOD to a Falshood, which is
one of the most provoking Crimes that Mankind
can commit. He or she who, with that slight
and superficial Affection, ventures into the ma∣trimonial
Vow, are to me little more than legal
<PB N="103" REF="119"/>
Prostitutes: Political Views may make a Mar∣riage,
but, in the Sense of God and Nature,
'tis my Opinion they make no Matrimony.</P>
<P>NOR does all this outside, skin-deep Affec∣tion,
which such Matches at first appear with,
protect them against the Deficiencies of their
own Tempers, and the Eruptions of their Pas∣sion;
it fortifies none against Family-Breach∣es,
supplies no Forces against the Attacks of
the Passions, and the Unkindnesses which in∣numerable
Circumstances introduce in the sub∣sequent
Conduct of both Parties.</P>
<P>THESE Matches indeed generally produce a
great show of Affection, and the Fondness of
the Honey-Moon hangs about them a great
while, on some more, some less. This I call
the Pageantry of Matrimony, and the Caval∣cade
of Love. But the Strife breaks out insen∣sibly;
the Contention, the Contradiction, and
all the little Thwartings and Waspishnesses,
which lay the Foundation of eternal Discord;
these all, like Weeds, grow and spread under
the decaying Plant called Love, till at last they
check and smother it entirely, and leave the
Family a kind of Hell in Miniature.</P>
<P>A late Poet expresses himself upon this Sub∣ject
with great Elegancy and Affluence of
Wit; whether he spake feelingly or not, I
cannot say:</P>
<LG>
<L>Thus a seeming happy Pair,</L>
<L>Who <HI>Hymen</HI>'s early Fetters wear;</L>
<L>In Publick fond as Turtles are.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The unwed with Envy their Caresses view,</L>
<L>But, Oh! what would the amaz'd Beholders do?</L>
<L>If as they see their open Loves, their private</L>
<L>Feuds they knew.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="104" REF="120"/>
AND whence proceeds all this, and ten
thousand times more than Heart can conceive,
or Pen set down, but from the want of a sin∣cere
rivetted Affection between them before
Matrimony? The Man that marries without it
must be a Knave; the Woman that marries
without it must be a Fool; and let me not give
hard Words neither, without a sufficient Au∣thority
for it; but I'll make it out immedi∣ately.</P>
<P>I say, that Man must be <HI>a Knave:</HI> No honest
Man will promise and engage, nay, swear to
do a Thing, which he is fully resolved not to
do; or which he is not sure he is able to per∣form,
and does not sincerely intend to per∣form.</P>
<P>IN the Terms of the Marriage Vow, the Mi∣nister
asks the Man these concise Questions:</P>
<P><HI>Wilt thou</HI> have this Woman to be thy wedded
<HI>Wife?</HI> He answers, <HI>I Will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wilt thou</HI> love her? <HI>I Will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wilt thou</HI> live with her? <HI>I Will.</HI></P>
<P>THE Interrogation <HI>Wilt thou,</HI> is understood as
much as if the Minister repeated it every time;
and though he answers with but one <HI>I Will,</HI> 'tis
as effectually understood to mean a particular
Answer to every Interrogation, as if it was
repeated to them all, and the meaning is the
same; the Man can by no means come off of
it; no, nor the Woman either, for her Engage∣ment
is equally firm and binding.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>I Will</HI> is not only a Promise obligatory,
a solemn Engagement and Vow, but 'tis done
under the Sanction of Religion, and of an Or∣dinance
of GOD; it is a sacred Oath, 'tis what
the Scripture calls the <HI>Oath of</HI> GOD, and the
married Man may justly say, the <HI>Oath of</HI> GOD
<PB N="105" REF="121"/>
is upon him; in short, every time he says, <HI>I
Will,</HI> 'tis the same thing, pardon the Expres∣sion,
as to say, BY GOD I WILL. He that
takes this solemn Oath, without being sure he
can sincerely love the Woman, and so perform
the Oath, must be a Knave, he cannot be an
honest Man; And how can he be certain, if he
did not really and sincerely love her before? I
think the Case is plain, and answers for it
self.</P>
<P>AGAIN, take the Woman's Obligation; her
Answers are the same to Questions not much
differing; and when the Questions are summ'd
up, (I need not repeat them here) she answers,
and says, or, if you will, she answers and
swears, as above,
<Q>I Will.</Q></P>
<P>YOU will! What will you do, Madam? Will
you live with a Man, and lie with a Man you
don't love? As I said before, that such a Lady
must be <HI>a Fool,</HI> I say now 'tis worse; 'tis but a
kind of legal Prostitution, in the plain <HI>English</HI>
of it, too gross and wicked to express. We must
not say she is a <HI>Whore,</HI> because the Law makes it
a literal Contract and Marriage. But GOD forbid
I should ever say 'twill pass for Matrimony in
Heaven; the young Lady, in short, is willing, or
has a mind, or desires, (call it what you please)
to lie with a Man; and she takes a Fellow that
is just in the same Condition, under the In∣fluence
of some lewd Appetite, and he desires
to lie with a Woman. They are both willing
to gratify their vitious Part in the formality
of a legal Appointment, and so they agree to
marry in form, and they are called Man and
Wife; as such she throws off the Mask of
Motlesuy, goes into the raked Bed to him, or
<PB N="106" REF="122"/>
suffers him to come to Bed to her; and as they
came together upon the meer Principles of De∣sire,
as above, so they act the several Excesses,
and all the conjugal Madnesses, Chamberings
and Wantonnesses, mentioned or pointed at
above, and all this while not one Ounce of Af∣fection,
not a Grain of original, chast, and ri∣vetted
Love, the Glory of a Christian Matri∣mony,
and the essential Happiness of Life, is
to be found between them.</P>
<P>IS this Matrimony! Is this a Marriage made
in Heaven! Is this being joined together ac∣cording
to GOD's holy Ordinance! Forbid it,
O Heaven! that I should call it by that honou∣rable
and religious Title: On the contrary, it
merits, if I may be allowed to give my Judg∣ment,
nothing less or more than the Title of a
Matrimonial Whoredom, or, at least, of a Ma∣trimonial
Prostitution.</P>
<P>IT would make a Story too long for the pre∣sent
Work, and a little too gross for my resol∣ved
Way of writing; if I should enter into
a Description of the conjugal Conversation
of two Persons, coming together upon this
Foot; <HI>that is to say,</HI> of meer Nature, and the
promptings of the Sexes, without any previous
and personal Affection; I say, to describe the
manner of their Conversation after the first
Principles of their Conjunction are evaporated
or exhaled, after the Fire is out, and the com∣bustible
Matter that kindled it is consumed;
when the Vapour is exhaled, the airy Part
spent and evaporated, and the humid Part ful∣ly
condensed; how coldly they meet? How
they look at one another, as a surfeited, cloyed
Stomach relishes a full-spread Table? How they
nauseate one another as a sick Body that is
<PB N="107" REF="123"/>
gorged with Physick, or a consumptive Person
sick of his Cordials.</P>
<P>HOW their very Mirth is dull and insipid,
and they are so far from diverting one another,
that their Happiness consists very unhappily
in being as much absent from one another as
they can. Unwarily talking once to a Gentle∣woman
of my particular Acquaintance, whose
Circumstances in Matrimony, tho' very good,
have yet a Defect of this kind at the Bottom.
Madam, <HI>said I,</HI> you are very happy in so kind
a Husband, so tender, so obliging; pray let us
have his Company; the Gentleman was but in
the next Room; and I was for calling him in.
<HI>Let him alone,</HI> says she very coldly, <HI>let him
alone, you han't so much of his Company as I
have;</HI> I had rather be without him; he would
have made any Woman in <HI>England</HI> a good Hus∣band
but me.</P>
<P>WHY Madam, said I, does not he make you
a good Husband? We are all of Opinion he is
an extraordinary good Husband. I don't know,
<HI>says she,</HI> it may be I an't so good a Wife as I
should be. O Madam, said I, don't say so; I
believe you are a very good Wife. Indeed,
says she, I an't so good a Wife as I should be;
we married young, and the main Ingredient was
wanting: We did as we were bid, but we were
never troubled much with the Thing called
LOVE; and I find, by sad Experience, Wed∣lock
is a miserable Thing without it.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, says I, your Circumstances
are good, and you live very easy on both Sides.</P>
<P>THAT'S true, said she; but I tell you, the
main Ingredient is wanting. I never lov'd
him; and I always thought he never could
love me; for indeed, I never did go about to
<PB N="108" REF="124"/>
oblige him, because I had never any real Value
for him.</P>
<P>THAT'S a very unhappy Case indeed, Ma∣dam,
said I.</P>
<P>SO unhappy, says she, that I would never
advise any Body to marry without they know
on both Sides, how things stand as to Love;
for 'tis all nothing but a Banter to talk of Hap∣piness
without it; they that don't love before
they marry, will never be happy when they
are married.</P>
<P>BUT, Madam, you have been long married,
said I; methinks kind and good Usage on both
Sides should have made Love by this time.</P>
<P>I don't know how it may do in other Folks,
<HI>says she,</HI> but 'tis not so with me; Mr. <HI>W</HI>—is
as kind and tender of me as I can desire, and
yet I don't know what ails me, I never did,
and I never can love him; it won't do; I
would advise no Body to marry before they
Love; let them depend upon it, if they don't
Love before-hand they will never love after∣ward;
it is not to be done; I have found it by
sad Experience.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, says I, the World thinks
you are a mighty happy Couple.</P>
<P>WHY then we have cheated the World, <HI>says
she,</HI> as we did one another; for, I can assure
you, as I speak to you in Confidence, we are a
very unhappy Couple.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, you don't Quarrel, <HI>says I.</HI></P>
<P>NO, says she, never; good Manners, and good
Breeding keep us from that: But what are all
those Negatives to make a Couple happy?
There's no Happiness without Love, and that
on both Sides. Oh! says she with a Sigh, and
so concluded the Discourse, let no Body marry
and come together without Love; 'tis nothing
<PB N="109" REF="125"/>
but what is not fit to name without it; 'tis all
scandalous and shameful; and so we called up
other Discourse; for I had enough of it, and
the Lady fell into Tears, and yet she confess'd
all the Fault was her own too.</P>
<P>AND what generally speaking is the End of
such preposterous Conjunctions as this was,
but a Birth of Monsters? Pardon me, I don't
mean that the Children born between them
shall be Monsters in shape, imperfect, unfi∣nish'd,
wanting their Limbs, or with more
Limbs than Nature directs, as in many mon∣strous
Births is the Case; though I could say
some pertinent Things upon that Subject too,
if the Age could bear it: But my meaning is,
these Conjunctions generally break out in
monstrous Consequences; Family Confu∣sions,
violent Contentions, unsufferable Pas∣sions,
raging at one another in vile Lan∣guage,
Quarrels, Feuds, Fightings, or at
least Insultings of one another; in all which
they act Furious, as in their original Gusts of
another kind, reproaching themselves with that
very criminal Part which brought them toge∣ther,
upbraiding one another with the very
Things which threw them precipitantly into
one another's Arms, from whence proceeded the
Ruin they bear. These, and a thousand mon∣strous
Passions, ungoverned like the Fire of
their early, blind and hasty Desires, are the
Effects of that preposterous Matrimony that is
contracted upon such Foundations as these.</P>
<P>HOW is it possible any thing but this, or
such as this, can be the Issue, since when the
first Desires are gratified, Dislikes and Aver∣sions,
hateful Regret and Repentings, as na∣turally
succeed such corrupt and half-born
<PB N="110" REF="126"/>
Love; as Hatred succeeded the same kind of
Affection in <HI>Ammon,</HI> when he had ravished his
Sister, and which made him, <HI>as it were,</HI> kick
her down Stairs.</P>
<P>A true Affection can never be the Product of
a vitious Inclination, any more than an evil
Tree can bring forth good Fruit, 'tis contrary
to the Nature of the Work; a chast, affectionate
Embrace is quite another Thing; the one is
from Heaven formed in the Soul for the good
of Mankind, by the glorious Hand of a bene∣ficent
Power, and directed for the Propagation
of a chast and virtuous Breed, fitted with in∣bred
original Modesty and Principles of Virtue,
as it were, convey'd by Blood to the Honour of
the very Ordinance of Matrimony it self, and
of the primitive Institution of it in Paradise:
Shall we constitute a vitious or vitiated Desire
in the room of Love, and a corrupt Combina∣tion
of two enflamed Pieces of Pollution under
the shelter of legal Forms, and call this Matri∣mony?
It can produce nothing but Mischief
and Confusion, the Nature of the Thing dic∣tates
no other.</P>
<P>TO say Love is not essential to the Form of
a Marriage, is true; but to say it is not essen∣tial
to the Felicity of a married State, and con∣sequently
to that which I call Matrimony, is
not true; and you may as truly say, that Peace
is not essential to the good of a Family; as that
the Harmony and Conjunction of Souls are not
essential to the Happiness of the Persons joyn'd
together.</P>
<P>IF the Man or Woman that is to marry do
not value whether they are Happy or no, or
whether they live with the Person they are to
marry in a state of War or Peace, always Jar∣ring,
<PB N="111" REF="127"/>
Fighting and Contending, or always
Agreeing, Uniting and Joyning in their De∣sires
and Designs: If it is indifferent whether
they are as Doves always brooding under one
another's Wings, or <HI>Serpents</HI> hilling at and
stinging one another, such may marry <HI>Blindfold,</HI>
and expect the Consequences; such a Woman
may take a Man as the <HI>Sow</HI> takes the <HI>Boar</HI> in
her Season, meerly to raise a Litter, meerly to
gratisy her brutal Part; and when that is gra∣tify'd,
and he or she perhaps surfeited with the
Person, may run away to an adulterous Bar∣gain
with another, for the meer gust of Vari∣ety,
as is often the Case; In short, what is
Marrying, and what is the meeting of the Sexes,
where Love and an original Affection is not
concerned? 'tis too wicked to mention, too vile
to name; to describe it would run me into the
worst Sort of Levity; and I must talk as vi∣tiously
as they act that do so.</P>
<P>CONCEIVE of it then in the grossest Terms
you can, in Terms suited to the beastly Part,
in Terms fitted to give your Thoughts the
greatest Disgust, and to fill you with Detesta∣tion;
for, in a word, there is nothing of De∣cency
or Modesty, nothing Chast or Virtuous,
can be said about it. It is true, every Body
that does marry in this manner does not con∣sult
the Reason of the thing, and do not per∣haps
consider what they are doing.</P>
<P>THEY do not look into the Scandal of it,
or weigh the Consequences; they desire a Man;
that is indeed the Fact; 'tis in the Nature of
the Thing, and cannot be denied: But the
Lady does not consider what Consequences at∣tend
its being desired in such a manner; she
takes the Thing as it appears; the Man offers
<PB N="112" REF="128"/>
to her upon honourable Terms, as they are cor∣ruptly
called, that is, he will marry her; she
neither enquires of her self whether he is the
Man of her Choice, whether she loves him,
and upon what Reason and Foundation the
Love subsists, whether upon his Person as a
Man, or his Merit as a Man of Virtue and
Sense. But she ignorantly passes over these
Things, and does not see that she lies open to
all the Censure, which, I say, is justly due to
such a kind of Matrimony.</P>
<P>THIS is saying as much in her Favour as
the Case will admit, as much as indeed it is
possible to say for her: But let her strip the
Case naked of all the false Glosses which 'tis
perhaps covered with, and then look upon it;
or let her look into it after a Year or two,
worn out in the odd, uncouth, retrograde Wed∣lock
that she is engaged in, and then she will
see with other Eyes; then she'll see she wed∣ded
a worthless, senseless, vain and empty sha∣dow
of a Man, in gratification of the Humour
which she was at that time in for a Bedfellow;
that she has the Man, and no more, and that
now all the rest is wanting; that she has the
Man but not the Husband, not the Compani∣on,
not the obliging, affectionate Relative that
she ought to have looked for, and to have fixed
her Choice upon; and what bitter Reproaches
does she load her self with when she sees her
self in the Arms of a Fool instead of a Man
of Sense; of a Brute and a Boar instead of a
Man of Breeding and Behayour; of a Churt
and a Fury instead of a Man of Humour and
Temper; and all this occasioned by her fol∣lowing
blindly and rashly that young wanton
Inclination, which she knew not how to govern.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="129"/>
THIS is treating the Crime with tenderness,
and the Criminal with pity, that must be con∣fess'd,
and I am very willing to do so in Com∣passion
to human Infirmity. But when all that
is done, I must be allowed to say, the Fact de∣serves
the severest Reflection, let the Ignorance
or Rashness, or whatever other Infirmity of the
Persons, be pleaded in their Excuse.</P>
<P>IT may be farther suggested, that sometimes
these, unhappy Consequences do not follow, or,
if you please, it is not always so bad. But
this argues nothing in favour of the false Step
taken, or the gross Conduct spoken of Provi∣dence
may, in Compassion to the Infirmities of
his Creatures, deal with them better than they
deserve, and may mercifully spare the Punish∣ments
which they ought to expect; but this
Mercy is far from a Reason why they should
offend; on the contrary, it is the Reason why
they should not.</P>
<P>ON the other hand: Now view but the Feli∣city
of a married Couple, engaged before Mar∣riage,
by a mutual, a sincere, and well-ground∣ed
Affection; who Love, and know why they do
so; love upon the solid Foundation of real Merit,
personal Virtue, similitude of Tempers, mu∣tual
Delights; that see good Sense, good Hu∣mour,
Wit, and agreeable Temper in one ano∣ther,
and know it when they see it, and how
to judge of it; that make each the Object of a
reciprocal Choice, and fix all the View of their
future Felicity in the Possession of the Person
so loved; whose Affection is founded in Ho∣nour
and Virtue, their Intentions modest,
their Desires chast, and their Designs equally
sincere.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="130"/>
WHEN these come together, there's Matri∣mony
in its Perfection; if they marry, they
can answer the Minister, when he asks them,
Will you love him? Will you love her? The
Man can say, I will, because I do; I will, and
she is assured I will; I will, for she highly merits
all my Affection.</P>
<P>IT would call for a Volume, not a Page, to
describe the Happiness of this Couple. Posses∣sion
does not lessen, but highten their Enjoy∣ments;
the Flame does not exhaust it self by
burning, but encreases by its continuance; 'tis
young in its remotest Age; Time makes no
Abatement; they are never surfeited, never
satiated; they enjoy all the Delights of Love
without the criminal Excesses; Modesty and
Decency guide their Actions, and set Bounds,
not only to their Motions, but to their De∣sires;
and, as Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> emphatically expres∣ses
it:
<Q><L>—“Shall to his Wife adhere,”</L>
<L>And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soul.</L>
<L>Milt. Par. lib. 8. fol. 214.</L></Q></P>
<P>NOTHING criminal can creep in between,
or among the Pleasures they enjoy; their De∣lights
are full, yet they are chast, temperate,
constant, and, in a word, durable.</P>
<P>THEIR Children are like their Parents, as
Streams are from Fountains, formed in the
Mould of Virtue and Modefty; not Furies and
little Devils, that partake of the Rage they
were form'd in, with their Blood boiling before
it comes to the consistency of its due Vigour;
but they hand down Virtue to their Posterity
by the due Course of Nature, and the Conse∣quence
<PB N="115" REF="131"/>
of due Calmness and Serenity in their
own Spirits; for it is certain, that Humour and
Temper descend in the Line of Families as
well as Diseases and Distemper; 'tis a just
Encouragement to Virtue that it is so, and
'tis just to let such know it for the Encou∣ragement
of their good Conduct.</P>
<P>HOW blest is the House where such a Couple
inhabit? and all this Difference flows meerly
from this one Branch, <HI>viz.</HI> Love before Marri∣age;
Love is the constituting Quality of their
Matrimony, the Reason of it, the Foundation
on which it was built, and the Support of it
after it was built. Such Families are happy by
the meer natural Consequence of Life; their
Tempers have nothing in them to form any
Discord or Strife from; they cannot Differ,
Contend; Rage, Quarrel, Reflect, Reproach,
Provoke, it is not in them; Nature has no such
thwart Lines drawn over their Constitution;
they are united in Good, and can never be
united in Evil too; these Contraries would not
illustrate, but destroy one another; in a word,
they are all Love, and because they are all
Love, therefore their Behaviour is all Peace;
the Calm is in the Soul, and when it is so, there
can never be a Storm in the Mind; Love is
not in them a Passion but a Quality; 'tis footed
and riveted in their very Beings, they have a
Disposition to it in their very Nature.</P>
<P>THIS being a settled Principle in them, both
natural and habitual, it comes of course to
exert it self in the Article of Matrimony. I
They resolve not to marry but where they are
sure and fully satisfy'd they can Love, that is
to say, that as they resolve it to be a Duty, so
they resolve to practice it. 2. In order to this,
<PB N="116" REF="132"/>
Prudence directs them to reject every Offer where
Love does not concur with the other Circum∣stances,
and make the Person perfectly not a∣greeable
only, but the Object of their sincere
and compleat Affection, and that upon good
Foundations too.</P>
<P>WHEN these Things happen, then they mar∣ry
; if the Person thus marry'd meets with a
Disappointment, as how often is the sincerest
Affection abused, be it that the Lady marries a
bad Husband, is mistaken in the Object, fixes
her Mind upon an unworthy Fellow that feign∣ed
Love, and Honour, and Vertue, in his Ad∣dresses,
and proves a Hypocrite in them all;
what is the Consequence? She is made misera∣ble
indeed, and wretchedly so; But we do not
see the House made a <HI>Bedlam;</HI> it is not Fire on
one Side and Tinder on the other; it is not
Sulphur and Nitre, which meeting makes
Thunder; the Brute behaves as Brutes will;
but the poor Lady mourns, sees her self made
miserable by the Man she loves; bears it as
Christians bear remediless Sorrows, perhaps
pines under it and dies, as is the fate of many
a faithful, tender, affectionate Wife: And 'tis
the same thing in the Man, he takes a Lady,
in appearance good; she is to him the Wife of
his Youth, of his Affection, of his first and pu∣rest
Love, whom he made his Choice before
Marriage, and places his Delight in afterward:
But as none can see the Inside and Soul of the
Object, she proves a Piece of Froth and Va∣nity;
is idle, luxurious, expenfive, thoughtless
in her Affairs, cold and indifferent in her Affe∣ction,
and, at last, loose and light; and, in a
word, any thing, or every thing, that is foolish
and wicked.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="133"/>
IT is not easy to describe the anguish of his
Soul at the disappointment: He had fixed his
Love with a firm and riveted Force as a wise
Man would and ought, long before he married
her, nay, perhaps before he courted her; he had
chosen her from the beautiful, the wealthy,
the virtuous, and the good-humoured, among
whom his Circumstances being good, he had
room to choose.</P>
<P>AS he loved before Marriage, he resolved to
love her afterwards, because he was sure he
should; and thus he resolved to make her hap∣py,
and make himself happy, in having her.
But how is he disappointed when he finds a
Traitor in his Bosom, a Fury in his Bed, a
Serpent in his Arms, that neither loves, values
or regards him? That, after a few Years, or per∣haps
Days, forgets all her Matrimonial Vows,
the ftrongest Ties of the solemnest Oath; thinks
of nothing but Pleasure and Folly, despises the
Entreaties of her Husband, and at last himself,
as a Husband; and, it may be, closes all with
running away from him, or with ruining him,
breaking both his Heart and his Fortunes to∣gether.</P>
<P>THESE are some of the Disasters where the
Love is on one Side without the other. What
must then be the Consequences where it is of
neither Side? How miserable, how distracted a
Family does it make! And in what wretched
Doings does it frequently End? To marry with∣out
Affection! It seems to be like two Bulls
chained together, that being tied so close as
that they cannot gore and kill one another, yet
are always striving to do it, wishing to do it;
and, if they break the Bonds, never fail to
bring it to pass.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="134"/>
I cannot think, and have so many Reasons
for my Opinion, I believe I shall never alter
it; I say, I cannot think the Marriage can be
lawful where there was not a resolved settled
Affection, sincerely embraced before the Matri∣mony
was contracted. I will not follow Mr.
<HI>Milton,</HI> and carry it up to this, that it may be
dissolved again upon that single Account: No,
no, I shall open no Doors to the vitiated Wishes
of the Times; where Men would have Mar∣riage
be a stated Contract; where as the Parties
agreement made the Bargain, so the same mu∣tual
Agreement might dissolve it; where as in∣sincere
Love joined them, a sincere and perfect
Hatred should part them again. This would
sill the World with Confusion, would pollute
the Ordinance of Matrimony instead of keep∣ing
it sacred as GOD's holy Ordinance; 'twould
make Marriage a Stale, a Convenience, to
gratify the sensual Part, and to be made use
of as a thing not to be named; and when that
worst Part of the Affections was satiated, the
Parties be left to please and gratisy their wick∣ed
Appetite with Variety.</P>
<P>THIS is not talking like Christians, or like
Men of Virtue, no, not like Men guided by
human Prudence, or by civil Polity, much less
Reason; for this would corrupt the Blood of
Families, level Mankind with one another,
confound Order, and, in a word, would fill the
World with Whoredom.</P>
<P>NO, no; if you will rush like the Horse in∣to
the Battle; if you will be mad, and follow
rashly, and without Consideration, the raging
heat of corrupt Inclination only, and go hood∣winked
and blinded, you must take the Conse∣quences
to your selves; if you will wed with∣out
<PB N="119" REF="135"/>
Affection, you must be content to live
without Affection; if you come madly together,
you must expect to live madly together; as King
<HI>Charles</HI> said to his Brother, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI>
when he had married the Lord Chancellor's
Daughter in private, and would have disowned
her in publick, you must <HI>Drink as you Brew;</HI>
in short, the Bond is too sacred to be broken at
pleasure; the Chain too ftrong for the two
Bulls to break; as you are once bound you
must remain in Bonds; once in <HI>Algier,</HI> and
ever a Slave; nothing releases you but a Re∣demption
by Death, on one Side or other.</P>
<P>HOW foolish then, as well as wicked and un∣lawful,
is it to marry before you love? To
rush into a state of irrecoverable Life without
the only Article that can make it tolerable?
They that marry without Affection go to Sea
without a Rudder; launch into the most dange∣rous
Ocean without a Pilot, and without a
Compass: Love is the only Pilot of a married
State; without it there is nothing but Danger
in the Attempt, nothing but Ruin in the Conse∣quence.</P>
<P>THE dirty Part of it I have mentioned; and
I still insist upon it, that it is not a Matrimony
of a right kind; to me it is no Matrimony at
all, but a corrupt, rash, hot-headed (and worfe)
Bargain, made to gratify the worst Part of the
Man or Woman, to please the grossest Part of
his Constitution, and for nothing else. Let a
modest Woman, <HI>if such she can be,</HI> stand forth,
and answer this one short Question:</P>
<P>PRAY, Madam, what do you marry this Gen∣tleman
for?</P>
<P>SHE cannot say, she marries him to take
care of her Affairs, as is generally the Plea of
<PB N="120" REF="136"/>
the young forward Widows, for she is a maiden
Lady, and has no Affairs.</P>
<P>SHE cannot say, she marries for Mainte∣nance,
for she is rich, and has a plentiful
Estate.</P>
<P>SHE cannot say, she marries for Affection,
for she declares she don't love him.</P>
<P>SHE cannot say, 'tis to have Children, for
she says something else to that, of which our
next Chapter shall speak more fully.</P>
<P>PRAY then, what do you marry this Man
for? Her Answer, if she will speak Truth,
must be this: Truly, because I want to lie with
a Man. Horrid Plea! Is this a just Reason for
Matrimony! And can it be honestly called Ma∣trimony
; whatever it may be called in the
Sense of legal Forms, can it be called so in the
Sense of Conscience and of Honour? Is it not
much more proper to say, 'tis a Matrimonial
Whoredom?</P>
<P>I see but one Answer that can be given to
this Argument, or be made a Plea for this kind
of Matrimony, and this is a coarse one for
either Party, I confess; but much more so for
the Ladies, <HI>viz.</HI> That Marriage is said to be
appointed to prevent Fornication; and that 'tis
a Scripture direction to marry, rather than to
burn. Let them that marry upon this Founda∣tion
acknowledge it then, and tell one another
so before-hand, and see how the Tale will sit
upon the Tongue of a young Gentleman, when
he courts a Lady, and begins to address her
thus:</P>
<P>MADAM, I have a great desire to marry
you.</P>
<P>PRAY Sir, <HI>says she,</HI> what do you desire me
for? You don't love me, I hear.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="137"/>
WHY, no truly, <HI>says he,</HI> I can't say I have
much love for you, or for any Body else.</P>
<P>WHY then do you marry, pray? <HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Madam, to tell you the truth, <HI>says
he,</HI> I want a Woman, and I am loth to go to a
Whore; so I will supply my self in a lawful
way.</P>
<P>THIS would be very Impudent, you'll say,
it may be; but I must add, 'tis honest, and
much honester, than to swear he loves her above
all the World, damns himself over and over if
he don't; tells her a thousand Lies to draw her
in, and when he is married, tells her the Truth
in a Brutish and insolent manner, that he never
cared one Farthing for her; that he wanted a
Woman, and took her for his Convenience; and
that now he has had his fill of her, she would
greatly oblige him if she would dispose of her
self out of his way, offering her one of his
Garters for the Occasion.</P>
<P>IT would lead me into the grand Error of
Language, which I have profess'd to avoid, if I
should pretend to give this wicked, vile Part,
a full Delineation; 'tis difficult to express such
a dirty Subject in clean Words; and therefore I
avoid giving the Ladies the Anatomy of a Cou∣ple
come together without a previous Affection;
or the Discourses that pass between them when
perhaps, one Side or other are disappointed in
the grand Expectation. It would surfeit the
Reader to hear a certain Tradesman's Lady call
her Husband—Dog, and ask him what he
thinks she married him for? Nor should I men∣tion
so foul a Story, did not Mrs.—give
all her Neighbours leave to hear her say a thou∣sand
Things, in plainer <HI>English,</HI> to him every
Day, of a grosser kind.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="138"/>
IF the Ladies will speak, the Boys and Girls
in the Street will never hold their Tongues.
When the Secrets of the Bed-Chamber become
no longer Secrets, and the Wife shall publish her
own Shame, who can she think will conceal it?
When she ceases to Blush, who will Blush for
her?</P>
<P>BUT 'tis enough; let us touch this vile Part
with as light a Stroke as possible, and you must
he content to go without the modest Lady <HI>S</HI>—
<HI>B</HI>—'s Story; as also the diverting Complaint of
Madam <HI>Arab.</HI>—with that of the new-married
Alderman—'s Lady, and several more of
the discontented Part of this modest Town, un∣less
you please to get an Account of them from
their own Mouths, which they are most ready
to do on all Occasions, as publick as you please,
Men, Boys and Midwives, being present.</P>
<P>THIS is the Effect of marrying without Af∣fection,
without a serious, preingaged Soul,
without mutual and unfeigned Complaisance
and Delight one in another; in a word, this is
what I call <HI>Matrimonial Whoredom;</HI> if I miscal
it, let me be convinced by the better Behaviour
of the Persons, that I slander the state of Life
thus entered into, and then I shall acknowledge
my Error; and it cannot be reasonably expect∣ed
of me before.</P>

of these Constitution-Regularities, but
that Successions and Inheritances should be
wholly Patriarchal, the Father dividing his
Substance among his Children, as he thinks fit;
and then they add Mr. <HI>Dryden,</HI> a leud Poet, up∣on
that Subject:
<Q><L>“When Man on many multiply'd his kind,</L>
<L>'Ere one to one was cursedly confin'd.”</L></Q></P>
<P>IF I was upon the Subject of <HI>Poligamy</HI> in this
Chapter, I should perhaps seasonably too, an∣swer
this corrupt Way of Reasoning here; but
it may come in its Place; at present my
Thoughts and Applications are another
Way.</P>
<P>THE Laws of our Country, and the acknow∣ledged
Principles of the Christian Religion
which we profess, have united their Force to
lay us under Subjection to this Part of Consti∣tution-Government,
<HI>as those Men call it;</HI> and
be it right or wrong in its won Nature, be it
better or worse in it self, and in its Circum∣stances,
we are under this Regulation, born in
the reach of it, the Laws of GOD and of our
Country bind us to it, and there is no room to
make that a Pretence; the Cavil can have no
force among us in this Nation.</P>
<P>LET me explain a little upon this Subject, and
if it be too grave, I shall be the shorter, but it is
absolutely necessary to be understood: It is plain,
whatever Silence we may pretend the Scripture
has shewn, our Laws have determined it to be
fixed fast upon us; no Man may have two
Wives at a time here.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="141"/>
1. BECAUSE the Laws of the Land forbid it,
and make it criminal.</P>
<P>2. BECAUSE both the Man and the Woman
bind themselves against it by mutual Agree∣ment,
and marry positively upon that Con∣dition.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THE Laws of the Land. Every Law is,
as I may say, of our own making: Every Man
is bound by the Laws of his Country, he is
bound to the Obligation, that is, to obey and
subject himself to them; and he consents in
the making to submit to the Punishment in
Case of a Breach of these Laws: The Parlia∣ment
is a true Representative of the whole
Country; every Subject is present at the mak∣ing
every Law that passes, though not perso∣nally,
yet he is present representatively in his
Representative, and actually makes every Law
that passies; he consents to it, and submit, or
promises to submit to it; and this makes his
Punishment just and rational too, if he breaks
the Law, because he first yielded to be go∣verned
by it.</P>
<P>NOW the Laws of our Country are of two
Kinds in this Case; the Common or Statute
Law, and the Divine Law, which we call Con∣science;
the first makes what we call Consti∣tution,
and is founded upon what our Le∣gislature
supposed to be the meaning and de∣sign
of the Laws of GOD; for the legislative
Authority of our Country never are intended
to contradict either the Law of Nature or the
Divine Law.</P>
<P>AS then the Laws of our Country enjoin
it.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="142"/>
AS these Laws of our Country are conso∣nant
to, or at least are supposed to be found∣ed
upon the Laws of GOD, and the Laws of
Nature.</P>
<P>AND as we are all bound, as Members of the
Constitution, to submit to, and be governed by
the Laws of our Country.</P>
<P>AND, lastly, we are bound by the Laws of
GOD, to obey the lawful Authority of that Go∣vernment
and Country we live under.</P>
<P>SO by all these Obligations we are obliged
against Poligamy, and it would be a sinful Ex∣cursion
for us to come into it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Because both the Man and the Wo∣man
bind themselves against it by mutual A∣greement,
and marry positively upon that Con∣dition.</P>
<P>WHAT we are mutually engaged by Contract
to perform, and which it is lawful to perform,
it is unlawful for us not to perform. It is a
Vulgar, but well-founded Proverb or proverbial
Saying, Every honest Man is as good as his
Word. Certainly a mutual Compact is mutu∣ally
obliging; nor can it be pretended, that
there is any Force in it, for the Man knows he
marries upon that Condition; if not, let him
but tell his Wife he will, notwithstanding his
Agreement, marry another while she is living;
and let him see who will take him upon those
Terms; if the Lady consents to it, that's ano∣ther
Case. I shall then say this only,(<HI>viz.</HI>)
that he does not offend her; he commits no
Breach, no Trespass upon her; as to his dis∣obeying
and breaking the Laws of GOD and of
his Country; let him answer for that where
those Things are to be answered for: But as to
<PB N="127" REF="143"/>
his Wife, he does her no Wrong, if he takes ten
Wives together, because she consented to it,
and took him under the express Condition.</P>
<P>THIS, I think, is a true state of the Case,
and confirms this Point; that let us pretend to
what Excuse we will for Poligamy, from the
pretended Silence of the Scripture, yet we are
effectually prohibited and fore-closed by the
Laws of the Land, and, by our voluntary Con∣sent,
expressed in the solemnest of all Oath, the
Marriage Contract.</P>
<P>BEING then under the Obligation of single∣handed
Matrimony, let us talk of it as it lies,
and go back to where we left off: This Matri∣mony
is at least the only, lawful, established
and regular Means of Propagation of the Spe∣cies.
All Births out of this Circle are, as it
was in the old <HI>Jewish</HI> Constitution, out of GOD's
Congregation, for a Bastard was excluded to the
fourth Generation; and all our Births <HI>extra</HI> Ma∣trimonial,
or, as the <HI>Scots</HI> call it, on <HI>the wrong
Side of the Blankets,</HI> are spurious, illegitimate,
and given up to the Reproach of Bastardy,
esteemed Corrupt in Blood, and carry the Blot
or Blend in the Escutcheon to the End of Time,
so that the Brand is indelible; no Time, no
Merit of Persons, no Purchase of Honours or
Titles, can wipe out the remembrance of it.</P>
<P>THIS then being the Case, I need not tell
the Ladies that this is the only Way by which
they are allowed, with Honour and Reputation,
to bring forth Children; 'tis the only Protection
to their Characters when they are with Child,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they have a Father for it; that it was
born in Wedlock; such a young Lady is big
with Child, there Scandal begins to open its
Mouth: Well, what then, she is married!
<PB N="128" REF="144"/>
There's an immediate Answer that stops every
body's Mouth; and the Virtue of the Lady is no
more struck at, nor can be; for 'tis the Road of
Nature, joined with the direction and limitation
of the Law, and that as well the Laws of GOD
and Man; of which at large in its Place.</P>
<P>BUT how then comes it to pass that People
marry that would have no Offspring? And
from what Principles do these People act who
marry, and tell us, they hope they shall have
no Children? This is to me one of the most
unwarrantable and preposterous Things that I
can think of in all the Articles of Matrimony;
nor can I make out; if I were to set up to de∣send
it, I say, I could not for my Life make
it out, that there is the least pretence in it to
Honesty, or to Modesty, nay, I would not un∣dertake
to justify the Morality of it.</P>
<P>BUT let us first see if it can be reconciled to
<HI>Modesly;</HI> for that is the particular Point I am
upon, and whether it does not come justly under
the Reproach of the Matrimonial Whoredom
that I am speaking of.</P>
<P>IF you should come to a Lady of the great∣est
Modesty and Virtue in the World, and put
it close to her upon any weighty Part of the
Subject, as about Settlements, inheriting E∣states,
and the like, she would not scruple, tho'
perhaps with some little Reluctance, at that
Kind of the Question, that she expects to have
Children when the Gentlemen and she comes
together: Modesty obliges the Lady to shun
and avoid the Discourse as much as she can;
but she tacitly owns she is to be understood so
in the very Nature of the Thing; and if she is
talked to among her own Sex, where she could be
free, and they were so weak as to ask her such a
<PB N="129" REF="145"/>
Question, which I think few Women would
do, as, whether she expected to have any Chil∣dren?
She would say, Yes, to be sure; what do
you think I marry for else?</P>
<P>NOW take a married Life, with all its <HI>Ad∣denda</HI>
of Family Cares, the trouble of looking
after a Houshold, the hazard of being subject
to the Humours and Passions of a churlish Man,
and particularly of being disappointed, and
matching with a Tyrant, and a Family-Brute;
with still the more apparent hazard of being
ruined in Fortune by his Disasters if a Trades∣man,
by his Immoralities if a Gentleman, and
by his Vices if a Rake: I say, what Woman in
her Senses would tie her self up in the Fetters of
Matrimony, if it were not that she desires to be a
Mother of Children, to multiply her Kind, and,
in short, have a Family?</P>
<P>IF she did not, she would be next to Lunatick
to marry, to give up her Liberty, take a Man
to call Master, and promise when she takes
him to <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Obey</HI> him. What! give her
self away for nothing! Mortgage the Mirth, the
Freedom, the Liberty, and all the Pleasures of
her Virgin-state, the Honour and Authority of
being her own, and at her own dispose, and all
this to be a <HI>Barren Doe,</HI> a Wife without Chil∣dren;
a Dishonour to her Husband, and a Re∣proach
to her self! Can any Woman in her
Wits do thus? It is not indeed consistent with
common Sense.</P>
<P>TAKE it then on the Man's Side, 'tis the
same Thing. I have known indeed a Man pre∣tend
to profess such an Aversion to Children
in the House, and to the Noise and Imperti∣nences
of them, as he called it, that he could
not bear the Thoughts of them. But then this
<PB N="130" REF="146"/>
Man did not pretend to marry; and so far he
was in the right; his Conduct was con∣gruous,
and consistent with it self, and he was
all of a Piece.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> BUT then pray note, <HI>by the way,</HI> this
Man married afterwards, and then he was ready
to hang himself that he had no Children; that
he was not like other Families; that he look'd
like a House that Heaven had blasted; that
others had Children enough, and some more
than they could keep, but he that had a plen∣tiful
Fortune, a beautiful Woman to his Wife,
and both of them in Health, and Years suitable,
should be barren.</P>
<P>AFTER some time, that, as if to punish his
unjust Aversions, his Wife was with-held Chil∣bearing,
she brought him two Sons at a Birth;
the Man was over-joyed and thankful for
them, and the fondest Father in the World:
Thus he stood reproved for his former Error,
and was a living Witness against himself.</P>
<P>THE first Part of his Conduct was scandalously
wrong, as I have said; the aversion to Chil∣dren
was unnatural; but then he acted the ra∣tional
Part so far, that he did not marry. But
for a Man or Woman to marry, and then say,
they desire to have no Children, that is a
Piece of preposterous Nonsence, next to Lunacy.</P>
<P>IF <HI>A. G.</HI> a grave Jester at Matrimony, who
tells us, 'tis the only Reason he does not mar∣ry,
that boasts the Ladies are every Day dying
for him, and that he would marry but that he
hates Children; I say, if he will please to have
one of those modern witted Ladies that desires
to marry, but would have no Children, they
may certainly marry, and yet resolve upon the
wholesome Negative between them for a cer∣tain
<PB N="131" REF="147"/>
Space of Time, <HI>viz.</HI> to Number fifty, or
thereabouts; and 'tis great odds but they may
obtain the seeming Answer to their Request,
and go barren to the Grave.</P>
<P>BUT if any doubt the Sincerity of the La∣dies
who make those Pretences, let the Gentle∣men
who has a mind to try them effectually,
and who professes to love a pretty Lady's Con∣versation,
but hates this foolish thing called
Coition, as <HI>Religio Medici</HI> calls it; I say, let
him put (<HI>Origin</HI>) upon himself, and then
Court one of those chast Wou'd-be-barren La∣dies,
and see if any One of them will take him.
My Word for them, and no venture neither,
not one of them would care to be seen in his
Company.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Roger l'Estrange</HI> in his <HI>Aesop,</HI> in the
Moral of one of his Fables, has this short Story
very well to my Purpose: “Well! I am un∣done,
<HI>says a certain grave Widow Lady,</HI> to
another Lady of her Intimacy; I am un∣done,
I say, for want of a good honest under∣standing
sober Man, to look after my Af∣fairs.
Every Body cheats me, no Body will
pay me; Mr.—has left me in good
Circumstances, but 'tis all abroad in Debts
and Accounts; and I am but a Woman, and
every Body imposes upon me; What shall I
do? I think verily, if I could but find such a
Person as I really want, I should be almost
tempted to Matrimony. But then that ugly
nauseous Business of a Husband and a Bed∣fellow,
and the rest of it. I profess my Sto∣mach
turns at the Thoughts of it; the very
mention of it makes me Sick; it puts me
quite off all my Thoughts again, so that, in
short, I shall be ruin'd, I know not what to do”.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="148"/>
WELL! however, as she had told her Mind
to the other Lady, and bid her think of it, and
find out such a Man for her, if she met with
any thing suitable to her Circumstances, the
Lady comes to her one Day full of Joy, and big
with the Discovery.</P>
<P>“Oh Child, says she, I have thought of
what you told me the other Day about your
Circumstances, I have found a man that will
fit you every way to a tittle; so grave, so
sober, so honest, you can never put your self
into better Hands; he is a Master of Busi∣ness,
and Bred to it; he understands Ac∣compts,
making Leases, letting Farms, knows
every Thing, and, in short, you can never
have such an Opportunity while you live;
for he will suit your other Proposal too, about
that usual Affair of Matrimony; you under∣stand
me, Madam; I can assure you, he will
never disturb you that Way, he has no
Thoughts of that Kind, nor is he in a Condi∣tion
for it.”</P>
<P>THE Lady heard her with Smiles till she
comes to the very last Words, when she turns
up her Nose with a snuff. Away! away! says
she, I thought you had known better than that
too; <HI>I love the Virtue,</HI> as I told you, <HI>but I hate
the Infirmity.</HI></P>
<P>NOW when I shall see any one of those
Ladies who are for marrying, but say, they hope
they shall have no Children; I say, when I shall
see them marry an <HI>Origin,</HI> or such a Man as
this Lady recommended to her Friend, and,
<HI>knowing him to be such,</HI> then I shall no longer
doubt their Sincerity.</P>
<P>OR when one of those Ladies, professing an
Aversion to Children, shall also maintain an
<PB N="133" REF="149"/>
Aversion to Matrimony because of it, and shall
reject all the best Offers, the handsomest Gen∣tlemen,
suitable Settlements, agreeable Fi∣gures,
and the like, and resolve the Celibacy of
her Life, purely because she would have no
Children; this indeed, however it may reflect
upon her Sense, and her Wisdom, will yet re∣flect
nothing upon her Virtue, or upon her Sin∣cerity,
because she acts according to her profess'd
Sentiments; and all her Conduct is of a Piece.</P>
<P>BUT to pretend to all this Aversion for
Children, to nauseate the Nursing, the Watch∣ing,
the Squaling, the fatigue of bringing up
Children, which, as they call it, makes a Wc∣man
a Slave and a Drudge all her Days; to be
perpetually exclaiming against this, and then
MARRY, what must we call this?</P>
<P>FOR a young, handsome and agreeable Lady,
with all the Blushes and Modesty of her Vir∣gin
Years about her, and under the best of E∣ducation,
to marry, go naked to Bed, and re∣ceive
the Man, as it were, in her Arms, and
then say, she hopes she shall have no Children,
and she desires to have no Children, this is a
language I cannot understand; it will bear no
modest Construction in my Thoughts, and, in
a word, is neither more or less than acknow∣ledging
that she would have the Pleasure of
lying with a Man, but would not have the
least Interruption from her usual Company
keeping; the Jollitry and Mirth of her younger
Years; that she would not abate her Pleasures,
she would not be confined at home, or loaded
with the Cares of being a Mother.</P>
<P>IN a word, she would have the Use of the
Man, but she would not act the Part of the
Woman; she would have him be the Hus∣band,
<PB N="134" REF="150"/>
but she would not be a Wife, and, if
you bear the blunt Stile that some People put
it into, she would only keep a St—n.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed no dissembling the Matter,
'tis neither better or worse; she would please
her Appetite with the bare brutal Part, but
would be freed from that which she calls the
trouble of Matrimony <HI>Child-bearing;</HI> which,
by the way, the most virtuous, modest, chast
and valuable Ladies in the World, have, in all
Ages, esteemed to be the Blessing of a mar∣ried
Life.</P>
<P>I remember there was an Example of a Lady
in a certain neighbouring Country, who mar∣ried
a Person of Quality, but conditioned with
him not to cohabit for a certain Time, I think
it was for a Year or two; and the Reason she
gave for it was, that she would not spoil her
Shape; but then, as above, she conditioned not
to cohabit, and yet when she did cohabit, her
Lord did not find her so chast, or that her Vir∣tue
was of so much value to her as her Beauty;
and she ventured, if Fame lies not, the spoil∣ing
her Shapes, in an extraordinary manner,
when she declined the Enjoyment of her own
Husband, and ran the risque of her small Waste
in the ordinary way. But that Part is not to
the present Case.</P>
<P>IN all the Examples I have met with, where
the Conduct of the Person has been justifiable,
they have joined to their Aversions for Child∣bearing
the proper Remedies, namely, absti∣nence
from the Men; if the Lady that desires
to be no Breeder, keeps her self single and
chast; if she preserves her Virtue, and remains
unmarried, I have no more to say, let it be to
her as she desires; no doubt she will not be
<PB N="135" REF="151"/>
troubled with Children if she <HI>knows not a Man;</HI>
if she with-holds the Means, Nature will cer∣tainly
with-hold the End, and if she dies Vir∣tuous,
I warrant her she dies Barren.</P>
<P>BUT here is a farther, and yet more fatal
Mischief attending, and which, if the Wish is
real, as I am to suppose it is, I see no room to
forbear suggesting, that she will certainly use
some Means to prevent it. The Truth is, there
is not much Sense in the Discourse without it,
as there is no Honesty with it: For what can a
Woman say to her self that lies with a Man
every Night, and yet really wishes and desires
to have no Children? 'Tis most natural to say,
why I must either take some Method or other
with my self, or I shall certainly be with
Child.</P>
<P>A certain Lady, not a hundred Miles from
St.<HI>Ann</HI>'s—, and who was one of the merry
Club, called, <HI>The Assembly of Barren Does,</HI> had
an unpleasant Dialogue with a Friend of hers,
who she thought to be a Privy-Councellor of
Hell, but proved not quite wicked enough for
her, upon this very Subject; another Lady be∣ing
present, who protested against the Propo∣sals,
though she was not averse to the Thing,
for which they were proposed.</P>

And what will become of me then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Become of you. Why, you will be
brought to Bed, have a fine Boy, and half a
dozen more after that, and do bravely, as your
Neighbours do, and as your Mother did before
you, Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Law—! Cousin, you distress my
very Soul; I cannot bear the Thoughts of
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no help for it, Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure there is, Cousin; something may
be done: I heard of one Mrs. <HI>Pleast...</HI> that
did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you little Devil, you would not
take Physick to kill the Child, would you, as,
they say, she did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but there may be Things to pre∣vent
Conception; an't there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, let me see, I don't
know<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she muses, as if to consider of it, and that she knew of some Measures that might be taken to answer.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="139" REF="155"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, Cousin, if it be possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, since you are so much in earnest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I am in earnest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, there are Things to be taken
to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! to make Folks miscarry. Oh!
I would not do that neither; I dare not do
that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! you mean to prevent your being
with Child, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I do mean that; but I wou'd
not take Things to destroy the Child, that wou'd
be murther. I wou'd not do that by no means,
Cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look ye, Child, I would not de∣ceive
you, 'tis the same Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I mean as I say; I tell you, 'tis
the same Thing, Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! the same Thing to prevent a
Conception as to destroy the Child after it is
conceived: Is that the same Thing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I say, 'tis the same Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain your self, Cousin, for I don't
understand you, indeed; it does not seem the
same Thing to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, in the first place, you would pre∣vent
your having any Children, though you
married according to GOD's holy Ordinance;
which Ordinance, as the Office of Matrimony
tells you, was appointed for that very End;
to take Medicines therefore to prevent, or to
destroy that Conception, are equally wicked
in their Intention, and it is the End of every
thing, that makes it Good or Evil; the rest dif∣fers
only in the degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="140" REF="156"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot understand your Niceties; I
would not be with Child, that's all; there's no
harm in that, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not all the Case, Child; though
I do not grant that there is no harm. Now you
have, as I said, married a Man, and he, no
doubt, desires and expects Children by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Mr.<HI>C</HI>—is mighty desirous
to have Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do ye think he would say to,
or think of you, if he knew you would be
taking Physick, to prevent your being with
Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would be very angry, I believe in∣deed,
very angry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and have very ill Thoughts of you,
I venture to say that to you, Child; therefore
be cautious, and act very warily in what you
do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Cousin, and so I will, but that
is not the Case, I don't fear his knowing it; but
as to what you were saying before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as I said before, I say again, your
taking Physick before-hand to prevent your be∣ing
with Child is wilful Murther, as essentially
and as effectually, as your destroying the Child
after it was formed in your Womb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be? when there is no∣thing
to destroy, I can destroy nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Difference, as I said before, lies on∣ly
in the degree; <HI>for Example.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, pray let me have an Example;
for I do not reach it indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why thus;</HI> you was with Mr.—your
Husband last Night; I'll suppose then, that if
you do nothing to injure it, and though you
<PB N="141" REF="157"/>
were never to lie with him more, you would
be with Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you hurt me but with supposing
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you, Child, but don't in∣terrupt
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I won't; tho' you wound<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she cries, fearing she is with Child, and dread∣ing to hear that it is not lawful to destroy it.</NOTE> me
deep every Word you say; but pray go
on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must suppose, as before then, that
you conceived as lately as you can imagine;
whenever such a Thing happens, it must take
its Beginning some where or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, if you take a Medicine to
prevent it after 'tis done, is not that destroying
it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>You fright me, Cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help that, I had rather fright you
than deceive you; the Difference is only here,
that by this Medicine you destroy a younger
Conception than you would do in the other
Case; but it is no less a real and an effectual
Child in Embrio, than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not that a Difference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Difference in Murther, whether
the Person killed be a Man grown, or a little
Boy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must I do then? Cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must you do? Why, be quiet and
easy, Child, and take your Lot in the World,
as other Women do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="142" REF="158"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I can't bear the Thoughts of Chil∣dren.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you should not have married, Child.
Why, did ever any Woman marry, and not wish
for Children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I know several that mar∣ried,
and resolved to have none, if they could
help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you know several Monsters of
Women? why 'tis preposterous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I know two in particular, and
they took Things to prevent it, as I would
fain do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they should have taken them be∣fore
Marriage, and honestly told the Man so,
and see if any honest Man would have meddled
with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Cousin, go on with your Dis∣course:
Why may I not take something to pre∣vent
my being with Child now, when, as I tell
you, I am sure I am not with Child, except for
a Night only? And why should I be with
Child just now more than all this while?</P>
<P>HERE the Discourse stopt a-while; and the
Cousin, though she had said it was against her
Conscience and Judgment, was prevailed with
to tell her of a Medicine, and a devilish one it
was, if she had set down all the Particulars.
<HI>N. B.</HI> You are to note, that it was a Medicine
indeed for the wicked Purpose; but the other
Lady that gave it her kept out the main and
most dangerous Ingredients, and gave her, as
appeared afterwards, nothing but what, if she
had been with Child, she might have taken
with the greatest Safety in the World. How∣ever,
the other having believed she had taken
<PB N="143" REF="159"/>
other Things, her Imagination made it work
other Effects than it would have done.</P>
<P>WHEN she had taken the Medicine it made
her very sick, and, in a word, set her a Vomit∣ing
and Purging most violently, and that threw
her into a high Fever.</P>
<P>IN her Fever she was exceedingly struck in
her Conscience with the Fact; and I could give
a very pleasing Account from her own Mouth,
of her after Reflections upon the criminal Part,
which she was then convinced of, and began
to be penitent for. But that Part is too serious
for this Time of Day, and few of the Readers
of our Times may be grave enough to relish
it.</P>
<P>BUT the Story turns upon another Part, be∣ing
extremely afflicted at what she had done,
and having no Body to give vent to her Mind
about it, her Cousin, who had unhappily given
her the Direction, being gone into the Coun∣try;
I say, the want of her to vent her
Thoughts, and ease her Mind to, joined to the
Fever, made her delirious or light-headed; and
in one of her Fits of Talking she knew not
what, she unhappily betrayed the Secret, told
what she had done to the Nurse that tended
her, and she had Discretion little enough to
tell it to her Husband's Mother, and she to her
Son, the Lady's Husband.</P>
<P>IT moved him with a variety of Passions, as,
in particular, an Indignation at the horrid
Fact, Anger at his Wife, who, thought he loved
to an Extreme, and had never shewn the least
Unkindness to her before, yet he could not re∣frain,
<HI>sick as she was,</HI> and even at Death's Door,
to reproach her with it, and that in the bitterest
Terms, which put her into a violent Agony,
<PB N="144" REF="160"/>
so that every one about her thought he had
killed her; and then he was as Angry with
himself at the impatience of his Temper.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to make out the short History
in a few Words, the Lady recovered, the Fever
went off, and she was restored to health, but
that was not all, she was restored to her Senses
in the Point in which she had trespassed, as I
said, upon her Modesty. But she suffered some
Affliction in that very Article, that she had
been blamed for; she lived near two Years
more with her Husband, and never was with
Child; and all the while she was under the
greatest Affliction for not being with Child,
much more than she was before for fear of it,
and indeed with much more Foundation.</P>
<P>HER Apprehensions now were, that her Hus∣band
should suppose either that she still used
Art with her self to prevent her being with
Child, or to destroy a Conception after it had
taken place, or that she had injured her self
some Way or other, by what she had formerly
done in such a manner, that now it was pro∣bable
she might never be with Child at all;
and these Thoughts, especially the last, did
really make such an Impression upon her Hus∣band,
before she could easily perceive a great
alteration in his Conduct and Carriage to her,
that he was colder, and, as she thought, very
much changed in his Affection to her, carried it
with indifference and flight, looked upon him∣self
as greatly injured and abused by her; fre∣quently
talked as if he thought the Ends of
Matrimony being really unjustly destroyed by
her with design, and wilfully, their Marriage
was void in Law, and ought to be dissolved in
form; and once or twice, if not oftner, intimated
<PB N="145" REF="161"/>
TO her, that he thought of bringing it
into Parliament, in order to obtain a dissolu∣tion
of their Marriage.</P>
<P>THIS terrified her to the last Degree; she
behaved her self to him with great submission,
and indeed, more than he desired; frequently,
and on all Occasions, protested to him with all
possible solemnity, that she had not taken the
least Step, or entertained a Thought of doing
so, towards any thing of that kind, since her
late Fever; assured him of her being fully sa∣tisfied
that it was unlawful, and that she had
committed a great Crime in what she had done
before; that it was a Sin against her Hus∣band;
that she had injured him in it, disho∣noured
her self, and offended against the Laws
both of GOD and Man. He could not say
more to her than she did to load her self, and
managed so well, so humble, upon the main
Subject, and so obliging to him, that she con∣vinced
him of her Sincerity, and he became
fully satisfied of that Part, as indeed he had
great Reason to be upon many Accounts.</P>
<P>BUT for what was pass'd, there was no An∣swer
to be given to it; she hardly knew what
she had done, and what she had not done; she
did not know what she had taken, except the
Names of some of the Drugs, what Effect
they might have had, she was as ill able to
know, as any Body else was to tell her; she
might have spoiled her self for ought she knew;
nor was she able to give him any Assurance
that it was not so.</P>
<P>THIS left him very uneasy, and, as I said
above, he did not fail to let her know it,
which extremely afflicted her; for though, as
above, he was a very kind Husband yet it
<PB N="146" REF="162"/>
was a Thing so very disobliging, and shewed such
a Contempt of him, when he was by all possible
means endearing himself to her, so that he re∣sented
it exceedingly.</P>
<P>UNDER this distressed Circumstance of her
Affairs, and dreading the being exposed, as a∣bove,
by her Husband's bringing it before the
Parliament, though he was soon satisfied the
House would not have engaged in it one Way
or other, unless it had been to vote it scan∣dalous,
which would have done him no ser∣vice
at all; I say, in this Distress her Cousin
came to Town, and she no sooner heard of it,
but she flies to her; and their first Meeting
produced the following Discourse:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Cousin, now I am undone indeed;
I am compleatly miserable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She could say no more for Crying, nor could she speak <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good while.</NOTE>.</P>

pray tell me, Are you with Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! miserable to the last Degree; I
can't describe it to you<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cries again vehemently.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, Cousin? I entreat you com∣pose
your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that cursed Dose of Physick you
gave me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Child, don't say I gave it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you did not give it me; nor I did
not follow your Directions in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? Did you take it when you were
with Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, I am afraid I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="147" REF="163"/>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then you made mad Work with
your self indeed; I am sure I directed you just
the contrary. But to tell you the Truth, if
you took nothing but my Directions, it was
a very innocent thing; it would have done you
neither good nor harm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but it purged and vomited my
Life away almost, and threw me into a<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here she tells her the whole Story as it happened, and as related above.</NOTE> vio∣lent
Fever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you were certainly with Child
then, and the fright put you into that Con∣diton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it did; for I had no soon∣er
swallowed it down, but I was in the greatest
Agony imaginable, at the Thoughts of what I
had done; I was struck as if an Arrow had been
shot thro' me; I was all horror and disorder,
Soul and Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, you frighted your self Sick: I am
sure what I gave you Directions to take would
have done you no hurt, if you had been with
Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you remember how earnestly I
persuaded you against the Thing it self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how I argued with you, that it was
as much Murther as if the Child had been grown
to its maturity in your Womb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I remember it particularly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Cousin; And do you think then I
would have given you a Dose to kill the Child
<PB N="148" REF="164"/>
within you, when you know how I urged
you against it so earnestly, and told you 'twas
wilful Murther?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you did give me the Di∣rections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, let any Physician see it; I'll
appeal to the best of them; I gave it you to
put a Stop to your doing worse, and for no∣thing
else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>And could it do me no harm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I'll answer for it, if you took no∣thing
but what I directed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I neither added or diminished,
I can assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let any Body shew the Receipt to
the Doctor, and I'll stand by it, that as I gave
it you to be rid of your importunate wicked
Design, so I gave it you to prevent your taking
something worse of some Body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Cousin, if that could be made out,
I wish Mr.—knew it, for he is disob∣liged
so by it, that I believe he will never be
reconciled to me; I believe he will expose me
for it, and we shall separate about it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she tells the whole Story of her Deliriums, and of her Husband's being told of it, as before.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a lamentable Story indeed, Cousin,
and Things have been very ill managed among
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, dear Cousin, what shall I do?
Are you so sure of what you say, that I may
depend upon it I have received no Da∣mage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will go to any Physician with you, and
convince you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="149" REF="165"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you did cheat me, then it was
a kind of a happy Fraud. Shall I let Mr.—know
it, if there is any Occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart; I'll justify every
Word of it, and satisfy any reasonable Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know whether any thing will
satisfy Mr.—now, for 'tis hard to remove
a Fancy of such a Nature when once it has
taken Root in the Mind: Nor do I believe all
the Arguments in the World would be of any
Weight with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, however, I desire one Thing of
you for your own satisfaction, and mine too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, let you and I go to some emi∣nent
Physician, and show him the Recipe, and
tell him the plain Matter of Fact; and let us
hear his Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will go to Dr.—then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cou.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this Agreement they went
to the Doctor, and he read the Particulars: He
assured her, that he who gave her the Medicine
to cause Abortion, or prevent Conceptin, or
to do a breeding Woman the least harm, de∣ceived
her; for that there was nothing in it
but what a Woman with Child might freely
take without the least Danger, and that no∣thing
in the Medicine could do her the least
Injury.</P>
<P>THIS gave the Lady her self full satis∣faction,
and made her very easy: But she did
not see any room to bring this Part about with
Mr.—her Husband, for that his Resent∣ments
were run high, and he grew warm at but
the mention of the Thing; but she thought to
<PB N="150" REF="166"/>
tell him all this Story would but lay the Weight
heavy upon her self, so she resolved to let it
rest where it was, and wait the Issue. And thus
she wore out, as I said, above two Years, tho'
with many hard Struggles and frequent Re∣proaches
from her Husband, who was extreamly
soured in his Temper by it, and did not stick
to use her hardly enough about it upon all Oc∣casions.</P>
<P>AT last, to her particular satisfaction, and
his too, she proved with Child indeed, and that
put an End to it all, for it removed the grand
suspicion, that she had poisoned or vitiated her
Womb, so that she could never conceive, and
she still wished to have no Children, which in∣deed
was the reverse of her Case now; for she
earnestly desired to be with Child, to put an
End to all these Dissatisfactions. And thus
ended this melancholy Affair.</P>
<P>FROM the whole Story, useful Observations
may be made very apposite to the Case before
us. The wretched Humour of desiring not to
be with Child, appears here in its proper light.
How direct a Crime it is in its self, is proved
from the Office of Matrimony, which is GOD'S
holy Ordinance, appointed and instituted by
himself for the regular Propagation of the Spe∣cies.</P>
<P>THE Argument against taking Medicines to
prevent or destroy Conception, which is the
same thing, is very just; since, in the Nature
of the Crime, it is as much a real Murther to
destroy the one as the other, as it is as much a
real Murther to kill a little Boy as a full grown
Man.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="167"/>
WHAT then are those People doing who talk
of Physick to prevent their being with Child?
It is, in short, neither more or less than a
stated, premeditated Murther; and let those
that act so consider of it, and come off of the
Charge of Murtherers, if they can.</P>
<P>I could illustrate this by several other Stories
or Relations of Matters of Fact, but I have not
room to spare on that Head. A certain Lady of
noted Fame, is, I hear, making her self more
than ordinarily remarkable upon this very
Principle, and assures the World, that she not
only thinks it lawful to wish she should have
no Children, but to use all possible Means to
prevent it; nay, she declares, as I am told,
that she not only thinks it no Injury to any
Body; but that it is far from being a Crime to
destroy the Birth or Embrio conceived within
her, and that she has frequently done it.</P>
<P>HERE she learnedly enlarges in her Discourse,
(for she is open enough upon that Subject) and
disputes upon the Question, Whether it is a
Sin to kill any Thing which has not a Soul?
And when she thinks she has conquered the
Difficulty, and has proved that every Creature
may be destroyed by Man, that has not in it
a human Soul, she brings it down to the Case in
hand: She says, that it is no Offence to GOD or
Man, to destroy a Cat, or Dog, or any other such
Creature, tho' it be not for Food, and tho' it be
done arbitrarily, without any provocation given
or hurt done by the Creature, but even if it were
in sport.</P>
<P>THEN, I say, bringing it down to the pre∣sent
Affair of a Child conceived in a Womb,
she begins a new Enquiry, which the learned
Anatomists, and the most skilled in the Pro∣ductions
<PB N="152" REF="168"/>
and Operations of Nature, have not
yet been able to determine, namely, When,
and after what particular Time, and in what
Manner the Embrio or Body of a Child con∣ceived
in a Woman receives the addition of a
Soul? How the Union is made? And when the
Infusion of Soul is appointed.</P>
<P>THIS she determines to be at a certain Time,
and descants critically upon it, in order to esta∣blis
the cursed Hypothesis of her own Inven∣tion,
<HI>viz.</HI> that all the while the <HI>Foetus</HI> is form∣ing,
and the Embrio or Conception is proceed∣ing,
even to the Moment that the Soul is infu∣sed,
so long it is absolutely not in her Power
only, but in her Right, to kill or keep alive,
save, or destroy the Thing she goes with, she won't
call it Child; and that therefore till then she
resolves to use all manner of Art; nay, she does
not confine her self to human Art, to the help
of Drugs and Physicians, whether Astringents,
Diureticks, Emeticks, or of whatever kind,
nay, even to Purgations, Potions, Poisons, or
any thing that Apothecaries or Druggists can
supply: But she goes farther, and joins with
the Poet, nay, she has the Words at her Tongue's
End from that famed Author, tho' in another
Case,
<Q>Acheronta Movebo.</Q></P>
<P>IN <HI>English</HI> she tells them plainly, if Drugs
and Medicine fail her, she will call to the De∣vil
for help, and if Spells, Filtres, Charms,
Witcherast, or all the Powers of Hell would
bring it about for her, she would not scruple
to make use of them for her resolved Pur∣pose;
highly approving of that known <HI>Spanish</HI>
Proverb, suited to the ordinary Occasions only
<PB N="153" REF="169"/>
of using dangerous Medicines from Quacks,
and unpractised, unacquainted Hands; I say,
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Proverb, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<Q>Let the Cure be wrought, though the <HI>Devil</HI> be
the Doctor.</Q>
<P>NOW this is an Example flagrant, and, as
I said, notorious, her Practice comes up to
the heighth of it, or else she is less a <HI>Devil</HI>
than she pretends to be, and boasts of being
much wickeder than she really is; in which
Case, I must own my self to be of the Opinion
of the learned and witty Dr. <HI>Fuller, viz.</HI> that
he that openly professes to be wickeder than
he really is in fact, is really and essentially,
whether in fact or no, as wicked as he pro∣fesses
to be.</P>
<P>BUT, not to dispute with this She-murtherer,
for it is not my Business here to decide either of
her Questions, Either when the Soul is infused
into the Embrio in the Womb of her that is
with Child, or whether it is less criminal to
destroy one than the other; I say, not to dis∣pute
with a Murtherer, I am to go on with the
Relation, <HI>viz.</HI> that she professes the lawfulness,
and owns she practises it, though not the last so
freely as the first. Let us enter a little into the
Circumstances and Character of a Woman that
does thus; that the Picture being set in a fair
View, those whose Blood is less inflamed with
the Rage of Hell, may look a little before
them, and consider, before they act the inhu∣man
Part with themselves, what they are do∣ing
or going to do, and what they may rea∣sonably
suppose to be the Consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="170"/>
FIRST, These desperate Medicines which
are usually taken for such Purposes, what are
they, and of what Kind? Have they an effect
only upon that particular Part which they are
pointed at? Are they able to confine the Opera∣tion
of the Physick to the very mathematical
Point of Situation? And shall the Poisons ex∣tend
no farther? Are they sure they shall af∣fect
no Part but the Conception? Shall the
Physick, like a Messenger sent upon a particular
Business, knock at no Doors in his Journey
going or coming? Shall it affect no other
Part? Shall the murthering Dart kill just the
Part, strike a mortal Wound just there, and no
where else, and innocently passing by every
other Place, do no more than just the Errand
'tis sent about.</P>
<P>WHAT if you should mistake, and the Ap∣plication
being misplaced, the Arrow shold
miss the Child, and kill the Mother? I have
heard of a certain Quack in this Town, and
knew him too, who profess'd to prescribe in
this very Case; the Villain, for he must be
no other, had his Preparations of the several
following particular Kinds, are for the several
following Operations, and accoridingly, gave
the Directions to his Patients, as follows:</P>
<P>“N<SUP>o</SUP>. 1. IF the Party or Woman be young with
Child, not above three Months gone, and would
miscarry without Noise, and without Danger,
take the Bolus herewith sent in the Evening
an Hour before she goes to Bed, and thirty
drops of the Tincture in the Bottle, just when
she goes to Bed, repeating the Drops in the
Morning before she eats; take the Drops in
<HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine, right <HI>Moselle.”</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="171"/>
“N<SUP>o</SUP>. 2. IF she is quick with Child, and de∣sires
to miscarry, take two Papers of the Pow∣der
here enclosed, Night and Morning, infused
in the Draught contained in the Bottle—;
taking it twice, shall bring away the Concep∣tion.”</P>
<P>“N<SUP>o</SUP>. 3. IF the Party be a Man, and he would
have the Child the Woman goes with preserved
against her Will, let her take the Decoction
here directed every Morning for three Weeks,
and one of the Pills every Night; but when
her Travail approaches, leave off the De∣coction,
and let her take three of the Pills, the
Child shall certainly be brought into the
World alive, though it may be some danger to
the Mother.”</P>
<P>THAT was, in short, he would kill the Wo∣man,
and save the Child.</P>
<P>THERE were likewise <HI>Recipe</HI>'s, with these
Directions: If the Party only fears she is with
Child, but is not certain, take these Powders
Night and Morning, as directed, her Fears shall
be over in four times taking.</P>
<P>IF the Party is not with Child, and would
not conceive, take one Paper of the Powders in
a Glass of warm Ale, every Morning after the
Man has been with her, and she shall be out of
danger.</P>
<P>I need give no Vouchers for this Account;
there are Peple still living, who sent several
poor Servants to him, pretending this or that
Part to be their Case, and craving his learned
Advice, and so have had his hellish Prepara∣tions,
and given him his Fee or Rate for them,
<PB N="156" REF="172"/>
and so brought them away, in order to have
him prosecuted and punished.</P>
<P>BUT I leave the Mountebank, my Business is
with the unhappy Ladies, who venture upon
these dark Doings, in pursuit of the wicked De∣sign
against Child-bearing; they run great risques
in taking such Medicines; and 'tis great odds
but that, first or last, they Ruin themselves by
it. This Wretch of a Quack could, it seems,
kill the Child or the Mother, which he pleased;
and you may, by a wrong Application, do both,
kill the Child and the Mother both at once,
and so be a Self-murther, and a murtherer of
your own Offspring both together; at least, 'tis
an Article worth a little of the Lady's Thought
when she goes abut such a doubtful Piece of
Work as this is; and if she should come to a
Mischance, she wold perhaps support the Re∣proach
of it but very hardly; I mean, if
she has any reserves of Conscience and Re∣flection
about her.</P>
<P>AGAIN: If it does not reach her Life, it
goes another length without Remedy; she poi∣sons
her Body, she locks up Natue, she damns
her self to a certain and eternal Barrenness for
the Time to come; and as boldly, as she says,
she desires it to be so, does not value it, and the
like. She might consider, that it may so hap∣pen
that she may alter her Mind; nay, she
may come to the Extream the other Way, and
I have more than once, nay, very often, known
it to be so.</P>
<P>NOR is it improbable but that her Mind may
be the most likely to alter, when she knows she
is brought to an impossibility of altering it.
Nothing is more frequent than for a Woman
to reject what she may have, when she may
<PB N="157" REF="173"/>
have it, and long and wish for it when it can
be no more obtained; the desires (of that Kind
especially) are generally very impetuous; the
Stream runs rapid and furious; and if she
should come to be as desirous of Children as she
may be now to destroy them, 'tis odds but the
violence of that Desire turns a Distemper, and
that to such a degree, as may be very trou∣blesome
as well as dangerous, and often proves
mortal.</P>
<P>SOLOMON says of the Grave and the Barren
Womb, <HI>that they are never satisfied;</HI> they never
say, it is enough: And what an Object will
such a Woman be, and, under such Reflections,
either by her self, or by others, that torments
her self, and perhaps some Body else, to be
with Child, after she has already dried up the
Juices, stagnated the Blood, and fettered Na∣ture,
so as that no such Powers are left by which
the Operation can be performed.</P>
<P>THE Lady I mention indeed, laughs at all
these Things, and bids defiance even to GOD
and Nature, contemns Consequences, and scorns
the supposition of a change of Mind, and a re∣turn
of Desires; from whence I infer only this,
<HI>viz.</HI> That she knows little what Nature means;
what go on till she comes to be her own Punish∣ment,
her own Tormentor, and to expose her
self as much in one Extream as she does now
in another; and if that should never happen, it
will be only said of her as it has been of many
a Criminal of a worse kind, <HI>viz.</HI> that she died
impenitent.</P>
<P>BUT to go back from the Person to the
Thing, for Examples import nothing, but as
<PB N="158" REF="174"/>
they confirm the subject, the Story may please,
but'tis the improvement of the Story, that sixes
the Truth of the Argument, which it is brought
to support: This horrid Practice, I mean, of
applying to extrardinary Means to destroy
the Conception, has yet many Things to be
said to it.</P>
<P>AS it poisons the Body, and, as I have
said, locks up Nature; so let me remind the
Ladies whose Vanity prompts them to the
Practice, especially too if they have any such
thing as Religion about them, that 'tis a kind
of cursing their own Bodies, 'tis Blasting them∣selves;
and as they take upon them to do it
themselves, how just would it be, if Heaven,
taking them at their Words, lays it home far∣ther
than they would wish or intend it? And
that seeing they desire to bear no Fruit,
Heaven should say, in the Words of our Saviour
to the Fig-Tree, <HI>No Fruit grow on thee hencefor∣ward
for ever.</HI></P>
<P>IT must be a Temper unusually hardened,
that could bear such a Blast from above with∣out
some Horror: Let any Lady, I mean Chri∣stian
Lady, for I direct my Speech now to such,
though they may be ignorantly or rashly
pushed on by the Folly of their Circumstances;
I say, let any Christian Lady tell me, if she
should hear those Words really and audibly
pronounced from Heaven to her, could she look
up with satisfaction, take it for a Blessing, and
say, <HI>Amen?</HI> I cannot but hope we have very
few of the most audacious Atheists among us,
could go the length.</P>
<P>AND now I have accidentally named that
Word <HI>look up,</HI> that is to say, <HI>look up to Hea∣ver,</HI>
for so I understand it, however, that Lan∣guage
<PB N="159" REF="175"/>
is pretty much unknown among us, I
could almost venture to put in a grave Word to
the Ladies that marry, and would have no
Children; those preposterous, not unthinking
but ill-thinking Ladies, I say, that will marry
but would have no Children; as 'tis most cer∣tain
that they expose their Modesty in it, so they
likewise expose their Christianity; and let me
ask them but this short Question; Pray, Ma∣dam,
what Religion are you of?</P>
<P>BY asking after the Lady's Religion, I do
not mean whether Protestant or Papist, Church
of <HI>England Presbyterian,</HI> but whether <HI>Chri∣stian</HI>
or <HI>Pagan,</HI> a worshipper of GOD, or of the
Devil; of one GOD or a thousand Gods, nominal
Gods; in a word, have you, Madam, any such
Thing as Religion about you? It is indeed a
Question, which, in a Christian Nation, should
pass for an Affront; but when People act
counter to Principle, and counter to Profession,
they open the Door to the Question, nay, they
make it rational and necessary.</P>
<P>BUT I will suppose the Lady shall answer, I
am a Christian, and a Protestant.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, then you will allow me to
say, that sometimes you pray to GOD, or, to
give it you in the Language of the Moderns,
you say your Prayers.</P>
<P>YES I do, <HI>says the Lady;</HI> and what then?</P>
<P>WHY then, Madam, you suppose, or grant,
that GOD can hear you, when you say your
Prayers?</P>
<P>YES, I know he can, <HI>says she;</HI> what then?</P>
<P>WHY then, Madam, you believe he will an∣swer
your Prayers too, and grant your Requests
also, because he has promised he will, if what we
ask be agreeable to his Will, 1 <HI>John</HI> v. 14.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="176"/>
WELL—! And what do you gather front
all this? <HI>says the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>GATHER, Madam; why, I gather this, that
as you are a married Woman, and would fain
be Barren, and have no Children, never give
your self any trouble about Physick, and tak∣ing
Drugs to prevent Conception; but knee∣down,
and very humbly and sincerely pray to
GOD to curse you with Barrenness: Tell him,
that you are one of his Creatures who HE, at
HIS first Blessing Mankind, had allowed to en∣crease
and multiply, but that you desire no
share in that Blessing; and so beg, that he would
be graciously pleased to blast the Child you go
with, if you are with Child, and shut up your
Womb, if you are not; for that you desire none
of his Blestings of that Kind.</P>
<P>IF the Lady I have been speaking to above,
is, as she says, a Christian, and prays to GOD
at any time; if she knows and believes that
GOD knows her Thoughts, can hear Pray∣ers,
and will grant her Request, if it be <HI>accord∣ing
to his Will;</HI> let her, I say, if she can do thus
without trembling at the Thoughts of it, go to
her Knees, and pray devoutly that she may
have no more Children, or no Children.</P>
<P>IF GOD is so merciful to her, as to deny the
vile, wicked Request, she ought to be very
thankful that her Prayers are not heard; but
if it should be granted, she must and ought,
with the same humility, to acknowledge 'tis
righteous and just, and that the Judgment, for
such it must be, is of her own procuring.</P>
<P>THIS would be putting the Matter to a short
Issue; and we should see whether the Ladies are
serious enough to carry their Folly to such a
highth, or no.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="177"/>
BUT there is another Length that some of
these Ladies go, and this indeed carries Things
beyond all the suggestions of my Title; instead
of Matrimonial Whoredom it should be cal∣led
Matrimonial Witchcraft; the Truth is, I
dare not enter into Examples here, no not
where I may have some Reason to suspect, nay,
to believe, nay, where I have been informed
it has been so, because I would not point out
any One as Criminal to such a degree, unless
the Fact was as plain, as admitted a Conviction
in the way of Justice.</P>
<P>NAY, when my Friend <HI>M—R—</HI> as∣sured
me, that his next Neighbour Mrs. <HI>G—W—</HI>
boasted in Publick, that she intended
to do so and so, nay, though I heard her own
she had done it; yet, as the Witches in <HI>New
England</HI> went so far in acknowledging their
own Guilt, and their familiarity with the
<HI>Devil,</HI> that at last they could not obtain to be
Hanged, no not upon their own Evidence, or
be believed upon their own Confession; so I
cannot persuade my self to tell you, that I be∣lieve
Madam <HI>W—</HI> really guilty of so much
Wickedness as she pretends to, or that she de∣serves
the Gallows so eminently as she boasts
she does.</P>
<P>TO go to the Devil to prevent GOD's Bles∣sing!
I must confefs 'tis very audacious; and if
Providence takes no particular Notice of such,
and gives no publick Testimony of Resentment,
it would seem very strange to me; I should only
say, there is the more behind, the Wretches have
the more to expect; let 'em think of it.</P>
<P>SOME will tell us, there is nothing in it; that
really the Devil has no Power to do any thing
in it, one way or other, and that all the No∣tions
<PB N="162" REF="178"/>
of Charm, Spell, Filtres, Magick Knots,
&amp;<HI>c.</HI> are Jugglers Tricks, and have nothing in
them; they reach the Fancy indeed, and af∣fect
the Imaginations of weak, vapourish Peo∣ple;
but that really these Things are out of
the Devil's way, and that he knows nothing of
the Matter, and can do nothing to help or hinder;
that the Devil has no skill in Midwifry, and
can neither tell a Woman when she is with
Child, or when she is not; he can no more
make her Miscarry, unless it is by frighting
her, than he can make her Conceive; that 'tis
all a Cheat, contrived by a Gang of artful
Knaves to get Money, pick Pockets, and de∣ceive
the ignorant Women.</P>
<P>HOW far this may be true or not, I leave to
those that are well enough acquainted with
the <HI>Devil,</HI> to know how, and to what De∣gree,
he can or does act in these Cases. But
the Crime of those People that go to him for
his help, is the same, whether he can assist
them or not; with the addition of Fool, if he
cannot.</P>
<P>I might ask here, whether this Practice is
consistent with Honesty? As for Religion, Mo∣desty
and Reputation, that I think I have men∣tioned
to satisfaction; but as to the Honesty of
it, there is something more to be said: <HI>First,</HI>
as i said above; to a Husband it cannot be
honest by any means: We'll suppose the Man
to be an honest, sober and religious Husband;
he married, no doubt, as Men of honest Prin∣ciples,
and of the utmost Modesty, do, that is,
in view of rainsing up a Family as well to inhe∣rit
his Estate, supposing that Part to be suffi∣cient,
as to preserve a Name and a Posterity,
as other Gentlemen do.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="179"/>
FINDING his Wife barren, at first he prays
heartily, as he may do lawfully, that he may be
fruitful, and have Children. Mark the Harmony!
he prays for having Children, and she prays
against any; he looks up to Heaven to entreat
he may be bless'd and encreas'd; she goes to the
Devil for help, that his Prayers may be fru∣strated;
he marries in expectation of Children;
she marries him, but endeavours by all the hel∣lish,
diabolick Arts and Tricks she can to pre∣vent
it, and disappoint him. And where is the
Honesty of all this, pray? At least, how is she
just to her Husband?</P>
<P>IF she had told him of it before Marriage,
it had altered the Case; or if she had acquainted
him with it when she did thus, and he had con∣sented,
it had been another Thing; at least, as
it regarded him, there had been no Injustice in
it, because of his voluntary assent to it: But
then it is foolish to suggest, for no Man in his
Senses would ever agree to such a ridiculous
Proposal, and therefore 'tis highly dishonest
and unjust to her Husband.</P>
<P>IT is likewise an immoral Action in it self,
as it is inconsistent with the Reason and Nature
of Things, and clashes with several stated Rules
of Life, which are of divine Institution. But that
is not, as I said before, the proper View of this
Discourse.</P>
<P>AS it is not honest or moral, so, on the other
hand, it seems not to consist with the Character
of a modest and virtuous Woman: If a Whore
acted thus, I should not wonder at all; for her
Business is to conceal her immodest, criminal
Conversation, and, if possible, to hide her
Shame; for her to apply to Physicians and
Apothecaries, take Drops and Draughts, and
<PB N="164" REF="180"/>
Physick her self from Day to Day, I should
make no Wonder at it; 'tis what her Circum∣stances
make not rational only but neces∣sary.</P>
<P>BUT for an honest Woman! openly and law∣fully
married! whose Husband is publickly
known; who lives with, and acknowledges her
to be his Wife, and Beds with her, as we call it,
every Night; for this Woman to desire to be
Barren, much more to endeavour to prevent,
or, which is the same Thing, to destroy the
Conception, blast the Fruit of her own Body,
poison her Blood, and ruin her Constitution,
that she may have no Children! This can have
nothing in it but Witchcraft and the Devil;
'tis scandalous to the last Degree; 'tis seeking
the Man meerly as such, meerly for the <HI>frailer
Part,</HI> as my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI> calls it, and that
brings it down to my Subject, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Lewdness
of it, which entitles it, in my Opinion, to that
I call Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>THEY may gild it over with what Pretences
they will; they may use their Female Rheto∣rick
to set it off, and to cover it; such as fear of
the Dangers and Pains of a hard Travail, weak∣ness
of Constitution, hereditary Miscarriages,
and such like. But those Things are all answer∣ed
with a Question, Why then, Madam, did you
marry? Seeing all this was known before, they
were as solid Reasons for not marrying, as they
can be now for not breeding. But the Lady,
as above, would venture all to have the use of
the Man; and as for her Reasons why she
would have no Children, she must account for
them another Way.</P>
<P>HAD the Lady been with Child, and had a
dangerous Travail; had she been frequently
<PB N="165" REF="181"/>
with Child, but always subject to Abortions, or
constant and dangerous Miscarriages; had she
received any hurt in the Delivery of her former
Children, which threatned Dangers if she came
again; or had several other Circumstances at∣tended
her, less proper to mention than those;
had she been abused by Midwives, or weaken'd
by Distempers or Disasters, this would alter the
Case.</P>
<P>BUT the Circumstance I insist upon is, when
the Woman marries, takes a Man to Bed to her,
with all the Circumstances that are to be under∣stood,
without obliging us to express them; lives
with him, and lies with him every Night, and
yet professes to desire she may have no Chil∣dren:
These are the Circumstances I insist upon,
the Aggravations of which admit no abate∣ment,
and for which I do not know one modest
Word of Excuse can be said. This is what I
call <HI>Conjugal Lewdness,</HI> nor can I see any thing
else in it; 'twas the plain End of her marrying;
'tis in vain to call it by other Names, and cover
it with other Excuses; 'tis nothing but Whoring
under the shelter or cover of the Law, we may
paint it out, and dress it up as we will.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF being Over-rul'd by Perswasion, In∣terest,
Influence of Friends, Force, and
the like, to take the Person they have
no Love for, and forsake the Person they
really lov'd.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Subject of this Chapter is
very particular, and the Effects of
it sometimes very dismal; one
would think it was hardly to be
named among Christians, that in
a Country where we pretend so
much to personal, as well as national Liberty,
any such Violences could be offered, or at least
be suffered.</P>
<P>AS Matrimony should be the Effect of a free
and previous Choice in the Persons marrying,
so the breaking in by Violence upon the Choice
and Affection of the Parties, I take to be the worst
kind of <HI>Rape;</HI> whether the Violence be the Vio∣lence
of Perswasion or of Authority; I mean, such
as that of Paternal Authority, or otherwise; for
as to legal Authority, there is nothing of that
can interpose in it; the Laws leave it where
it ought to be left, and the Laws of Matri∣mony,
in particular, leave it all upon the
<PB N="167" REF="183"/>
Choice of the Person, and in the Power of their
Will; and therefore, as by the Office of Matri∣mony
appears, it does not say to the Person,
Thou shalt take this Man, or thou shalt take
this Woman, but <HI>Wilt thou</HI> take this Man, and
<HI>Wilt thou</HI> take this Woman? and unless the Per∣son
says, <HI>I WILL,</HI> which is a Declaration of
free Consent, and indeed strongly implies a
free Choice, there can be no Matrimony.</P>
<P>HENCE I might enter into a long Discourse
of the Justice of young People on either Side,
resisting the Perswasions, nay, indeed the Com∣mands
of those who otherwise they ought to
obey, in a Case of this moment. I should be
very loth to say any thing here to encourage
Breach of Duty in Children to Parents; but as
in this Case the Command seems exorbitant, so
the Obedience seems to be more limited than in
any other, and therefore I may go farther here
than I would do in any of the Points of Subor∣dination
in other Cases.</P>
<P>IT is a Maxim in Law as well as in Reason,
there is no Duty in Obeying where there is
no Authority to Command; or, if you will,
thus: There is no Obligation to Obey where
there is no Right to Command; the Parent
has, no question, a right to Command, nay, to
goveru and over-rule the Child in all lawful
Things: But if the Parent commands the
Child to do an unlawful Action, the Child may
decline it; for a Thing cannot be lawful and
unlawful at the same time.</P>
<P>IT is evident in the Case before me, if the
Parent commands his Child to marry such or
such a Person, and the Child either cannot love
the Person, or at the same time declares he or
she is engaged in Affection to another, the
<PB N="168" REF="184"/>
Command of the Parent cannot be lawfully
obeyed, because it is unlawful for the Child to
marry any Person he or she cannot love; nay,
the very doing it is destructive of Matrimony,
and they must either lie one way or other, or
else they cannot obey it, for they cannot be mar∣ried:
For example,</P>
<P>A Father says to his Son, I would have you
marry such a young Lady.</P>
<P>OH! Sir, says the Son, I beg of you don't
desire of it me, she is a Woman that of all the
Women in the World, I would not marry upon
any Account whatever.</P>
<P>DON'T tell me you will not marry her, says
the Father, I have good Reasons for your hav∣ing
her.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, says the Son, I hope you won't
insist upon it; for I can't do it.</P>
<P>WHAT do you mean? You can't do it, says
the Father angrily.</P>
<P>WHY, Sir, <HI>says the Son,</HI> I can't love her.</P>
<P>O, well; you must venture that, says the
Father, marry her first, and you'll love her af∣terwards.</P>
<P>INDEED, I can't marry upon that Foot Sir,
<HI>says the Son,</HI> but respectfully, it would be a Sin
to marry a Woman I can't love.</P>
<P>I tell you, <HI>says the Father,</HI> I have singled her
out for you, and I expect you should have
her.</P>
<P>I am sorry, Sir, you should choose a Wife
for me, <HI>says the Son,</HI> and never let me know
it.</P>
<P>I think 'tis your Duty to submit, <HI>says the
Father,</HI> as long as I think she is a suitable Match
for you, and for the Family.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="185"/>
BUT, Sir, <HI>says the Son,</HI> 'tis impossible: I can
never be married to her; no Clergyman dares
marry me to her.</P>
<P>WHAT d'ye mean by that? <HI>says his Father.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Sir, <HI>says the Son,</HI> either I must Lie and
be Forsworn, or he can't marry me, and I hope
you would not desire me either to Lie, or to be
Perjured.</P>
<P>DON'T tell me of Lying and Perjury, says
the passionate Father, I don't enquire into your
impertinent Cavils, I tell you, she will make a
very good Wife for you, and I say, you shall
have her.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, says the Son, if you can make
any Minister marry me to her.</P>
<P>WHAT is it you mean, says the Father,
to offer such Stuff to me? If you don't take
her, it shall be worse for you; I tell you, you
shall have her.</P>
<P>WHY, Sir, says the Son, when he asks me,
if I will take her? I may answer, <HI>I Will:</HI> But
when he comes to say, <HI>Wilt thou love her?</HI> I
must say, <HI>I Will not;</HI> I must lie, if I should
say, <HI>I Will;</HI> and if he can marry me so, let
him.</P>
<P>I don't make a Jest of it Son, <HI>says the Fa∣ther,</HI>
I expect you go and wait upon her,
for I will have you marry her, I tell you.</P>
<P>THUS the Father laid it upon him hard; he
put it off with this a great while, that he
could not love her; but the Father insisted up∣on
it, and threatened to disinherit him; and so
he wickedly complied, married the Woman
he hated, and forsook a young Lady that loved
him, and that he was in love with; and he
was unhappy, and cursed his Marriage to his
dying Day; and so was the Woman he married
<PB N="170" REF="186"/>
also. Indeed, he did not go so far as the Son
did in the Example I gave you before; he did
not marry them both, but he was very un∣happy.</P>
<P>THE Limits of a Parent's Authority, in this
Case of Matrimony, either with Son or Daugh∣ter,
I think, stands thus: The Negative, I think,
is theirs, especially with a Daughter; but, I
think, the Positive is the Childrens.</P>
<P>IF the Child looks Retrograde, and would
throw her self away upon a Scoundrel, upon her
Father's Coachman, or Book-keeper, or upon
any thing unworthy of the Family and For∣tune
of the Lady, much more if the Person
she inclines to marry is scandalous, a Man of
Vice, a Man of an ill Character, a Drunkard,
a Gamester, a Rake, or what else is to be called
scandalous, the Father, or Mother, or next
Parent or Guardian may, I believe with Justice,
interpose their Authority, and may command
her not to take such or such a Person, the Fa∣ther
may put the Negative upon her; nor is it
sufficient for her to say, she loves the Man, or
is in love with the Man.</P>
<P>BUT when the same Father or Parent comes
and directs her the said Daughter, and says posi∣tively,
you shall marry such or such a Man who∣ther
you love him or not; there, I think, the Case
differs extreamly; and the young Lady telling
them, she does not like the Man, that she can∣not
love him, and won't marry him for that
Reason, is a justifiable Reason, and she ought
not to be forced: Or, if she says, that she is in
love with another, and that other is not yet
discovered, 'tis nevertheless a sufficient Reason,
and she ought not to be forced; nor can the
Command of a Father or Mother, bind her to
<PB N="171" REF="187"/>
marry the Man she cannot love, because it
would be an unlawful Action, unjust and inju∣rious
both to the Man and to her self; and no
Command of a Parent can be obliging upon
her, to do an unlawful or unjust Action.</P>
<P>THE Parent therefore may command her not
to marry this or that Person, but may not
command her to marry any particular Person,
who she declares her self not to love; for this
would be to command her to lie, and be for∣sworn,
in the express Terms of the Marriage
Contract.</P>
<P>AGAIN; it were to be wished, that every
one that marries before they fix their Affection
sincerely upon the Person they are to have,
would consider what I just mentioned above,
<HI>(viz.)</HI> the Wrong they do to the Person they
take; suppose it be the Woman, who, at the
Book, they promise upon Oath <HI>to love,</HI> and yet
afterwards perhaps, tell them to their Faces,
they never loved them at all: This is an irre∣trievable
Injury to the Person, who perhaps
was, as it were, snatched out of the Arms of
those that did love her, and of another that
would have loved her, and who perhaps she
loved also, and, persuaded or over-ruled by Pa∣rents,
to take one who pretended as much to
love as any one, but only took her for her
Money, and venturing upon those Pretensions,
she or he is now deceived and disappointed, the
Wrong is irreparable; the Lady that might, if
he had let her alone, been made happy, is a∣bused,
is made miserable, is injured in the
grossest manner, and he had much better have
ravished her, and been hanged, as he deserved;
I mean better for her; then she had been free
again, and though she had been abused, the In∣jury
<PB N="172" REF="188"/>
had been at an End; but here she is abused'
daily, the Crime is renewed, and she is made
unhappy to the End of her Life.</P>
<P>THIS marrying without Affection, or con∣trary
to Inclination, has a variety of compli∣cated
Mischiefs attending it, and especially con∣sidering
that, upon the least disagreeableness
between the Persons married, former Objects,
and former Thoughts revive in the Mind;
they are always comparing their Condition
with what it might have been, with what
others are, and with what, at least, they fancy
others are; ever repining at what is, ever wish∣ing
what can never be. Every thing they
have is disagreeable and unpleasant; they look
on their Life as a Slave at <HI>Algier</HI> looks upon his
Chains, they fancy themselves as Persons
only bought and sold, as Persons committed by
Warrant, and made Prisoners for Life.</P>
<P>THE State they are in is imbittered by every
Circumstance, and every Circumstance imbit∣tered
by the want of Affection, the Thing is
bad in it self, and want of Affection makes every
Part of it worse.</P>
<P>NOR is it probable that such a Marriage
should issue otherwise; I had almost said it is
not possible: But the Nature of the thing di∣rects
it, and the disagreeableness can hardly
fail to happen, because there is not only no
Fund of Affection to build upon, but a kind
of a pre-ingaged Aversion, which is certain to
assist and to render every thing worse, rather
than better.</P>
<P>I could give a long History of a Family,
within the compass of my own Observation,
where both the Man and the Woman were thus
stated; that is to say, brought together by the
<PB N="173" REF="189"/>
Allurement of good Circumstances, and the
over-ruling Directions of their immediate Go∣vernors
and Friends; when, on both Sides, their
Choice and Affections were guided, at least a∣gainst
the respective Object, if not to other
Objects; and though perhaps those other Ob∣jects
were not indeed so suitable as to Birth
and Fortune, for this Breach happened in a Fa∣mily
of some Figure, and among that we call
Quality, yet the Choice they had made for them∣selves
had certainly been more suitable to them
as Man and Woman, and had tended infinitely
more to their satisfaction.</P>
<P>IT seems they had frequently Rufflings
and Rencounters, as they might be called, upon
the Subject before; and as they went upon an old
Mob Rule, <HI>That few Words among Friends</HI> were
<HI>best,</HI> and <HI>those very spitsful;</HI> so if they did fall
out, it was short, but bitter; and this Battle,
which I happened to have the following Ac∣count
of, and which was one of the worst they
ever had, may pass for a Specimen:</P>
<P>IT happened to be at Supper, and the Gen∣tleman
had drank to his Lady with a kind of
a snear and a bow, and <HI>My Service to your Lady∣ship</HI>
(for she was a Lady). <HI>Ay, ay,</HI> says she, <HI>Ser∣vice!
Service!</HI> repeating the Word two or three
times; it's well where there is no Love there
can be a little good Manners; and so the Bat∣tle
was begun.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>The sooner the better, Sir <HI>Thomas.</HI>
Heaven keep you in the mind.</P>
<P>IN short, the Lady had the better of him,
and put him in a Rage, and then he left her,
and went out of the Room; but about the
usual time of going to Bed, they came a little
to themselves again, and were preparing to go
to Bed, when a few Words rising the Wind, it
blew up into another Storm, and they fell out
more furiously than before.</P>
<P>SHE told him, she had had but two Children,
and she thanked GOD they were both dead.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="193"/>
HE told her, he desired no more of the
Breed.</P>
<P>SHE replied, she desired all the World to
take notice, that if ever she was with Child
again, it would be a Bastard, and none of his.</P>
<P>HE turned round from her, and bad her turn
her back to him.</P>
<P>SHE said, with all her Heart, and did so.</P>
<P>NOW curse your self, said he, if ever you
turn your Face to me again.</P>
<P>SHE said, she knew a better Way for it than
that; so she called her Maid, took her leave of
him, and went to Bed by her self.</P>
<P>THE Next Day she took her Coach, and went
to a Relation's House, took some Jewels with
her, and sent for her Cloaths. And thus ended
a <HI>Mother-Made Match</HI> on one hand, and a
<HI>Money-Made</HI> match on the other hand; On both
hands without Affection, and where they had
been mutually pre-ingaged to other Objects:
And what was all this, pray, but a Matrimonial
Whoredom!</P>
<P>IT would take up too much of this Work, to
give the short History of the remaining Life of
these two passionate married Enemies, for such
they were. As they were People of good
Fashion and Figure, they might have quarrelled
with some reserve to good Manners; but, on
the contrary, she pursued him with all the
spite and rage of her Tongue that it was pos∣sible
for a Woman to invent; said all the Bitter
and disdainful Things of him that Ill-nature
could inspire her with; scorned all the Motions
of Friends towards a Reconciliation to him, which
at first he was not averse to; and, at last, gave
out, that he kept a Whore, and that she intend∣ed
to sue him to a Divorce.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="194"/>
IN return, after he found her obstinate, he
put all the Contempt upon her he was able, and
in all Company where he could possibly come at
her; made Ballads and Songs of her; and, in a
word, they took all possible Ways on both Sides
to make it impossible they should ever come to∣gether
again.</P>
<P>AFTER some Time, he went abroad into
<HI>France,</HI> when he did the spitefullest Thing that
it was possible for him to do, or that, I think,
a Man could ever do by a Wife: Being, (as he
had given out) at <HI>Paris,</HI> he caus'd a Rumour to
be rais'd that he was very Sick, and a little
after that he was Dead. This he carried so far,
that his Servants and Dependents, who he left
at his House, were all put into Mourning, and
the Lady was firmly convinced that he was
Dead; nay, he employed a subtle, managing
Fellow, to come to the House where the Lady
lodged, to give an Account of his Death, and
that he was at the Funeral.</P>
<P>IN a word, Things were carried so far, that
the Lady was courted by another Gentleman,
and, at length, consented to be married; but
all things being prepared for the Wedding; Set∣tlements
made, the very Day come, and her
Friends about her, he sends a Messenger to
tell her, that he was coming to the Church to
see her married, that he would have remained
in his Grave a little longer, but that he was
resolved she should not have so much Pleasure
as that of one Day's Delusion; and that he
would not do the Gentleman the Injury, of let∣ting
him ignorantly marry a She-Devil, as he
had done.</P>
<P>THIS was managed so wickedly, and with
such a keenness and severity of Spight, that it
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
almost cost the Lady her Life; and it might
have gone farther, for the Gentleman was as∣fronted
so, that he demanded Satisfaction of
him, and it went up to a Challenge; but some
Friends interposed, so that they did not fight.</P>
<P>THE enraged Lady fell sick with Disdain;
and the Fury that this Piece of Management put
her in was such, that she continued languishing
near two Years, but then recovered. A great
many Friends interposed, if possible, to reconcile
them; but there was no room for that, it was
gone too far.</P>
<P>AT length they brought it to a Truce, tho'
they could not bring it to a Peace; they brought
them to an Agreement of Civility, <HI>viz.</HI> not to
Insult or Affront one another any more; and
this was all they could ever be brought to; nor
was it easy to bring them to that, so exasperated
were they on both sides, so irreconcileably pro∣voked,
especially the Woman.</P>
<P>THIS is one Example of a Marriage by force
of Friends, and by motives of Avarice and
Pride, where the Parties were pre-ingaged by
their Affection to other Objects. I could give
many Instances in their degree equally unhap∣py,
though perhaps not carried on to such an
extravagant Length, but all serve to convince
us, how fatal it is for Men or Women to engage
their Persons one Way, and their Affections
another.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY those People who have the
least value for their own Ease, that expect any
Felicity in a married Life, should think before
they take this Leap in the Dark; I say, they
should think a little, how, in the Nature of the
thing, they can expect Happiness in a Woman
they do not love; and in a Woman who they
<PB N="180" REF="196"/>
shall be tied to live with while they Love ano∣ther,
and shall be Night and Day wishing their
beloved <HI>Rachel</HI> were in their Arms instead of
the blear-eyed <HI>Leah,</HI> which they have taken in
her Place.</P>
<P>BUT thus it is, and that too frequently to
wonder at, that Men love the Person they do
not marry, and marry the Person they cannot
love.</P>
<LG>
<L>Tell me, ye sacred Powers, which Rule on high,</L>
<L>If Love's a Heaven-born Passion, Tell me why,</L>
<L>Do Mortals love, and Heaven so oft deny?</L>

Love with another.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>O Love and not to Marry, is Na∣ture's
Aversion; to Marry and not
to Love, is Nature's Corruption;
the first is Hateful, the last is re∣ally
Criminal; and, as has been
said in its Place, it is, in some Re∣spects,
both Murther and Robbery; it makes a
Man <HI>Felo de se,</HI> with respect to all the Comforts
of his Life; and it makes him a Robber to his
Wife, if she be a Woman that has the misfor∣tune
to Love him. And this I have spoken to
at large in the last Chapter.</P>
<P>BUT to marry one Woman and love another,
to marry one Man and be in love with another,
this is yet worse, tenfold worse, if that be pos∣sible!
'tis, in its kind, a meer Piece of Witch∣craft;
it is a kind of civil, legal <HI>Adultry,</HI> nay, it
makes the Man or Woman be committing Adul∣tery
in their Hearts every Day of their lives;
and can I be wrong therefore to say, that it may
be very well called a Matrimonial Whoredom?
if I may judge, it is one of the worst Kinds
of it too.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="198"/>
IT is (first) a plain downright Crime in the
beginning of it; if both the Man and the Wo∣man
are in it, they indeed cheat one another;
first the man thinks the Woman has the worst
of it, and that he only cheats her; she fancies
he has the worst of it, and that she cheats him;
but, in short, 'tis a mutual Fraud, wherein
both are Cheats and both Cheated, both Deceivers
and both Deceived.</P>
<P>WHEN they come to the Book to marry,
they mutually engage what was engaged before,
like a Knave that borrows Money upon an Estate
which he had mortgaged already. Mark what
a Complication of Crimes meet together in the
Church; when they come up to the Altar,
the Man plights her his Troth or Truth, that he
will love her; when he knows he cannot do it,
for that he loves another already before her.</P>
<P>THE Woman plights him her Troth, that she
will love him, when, as the Lady just now
mentioned, told Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>—, she heartily
hated him from the first time she ever saw him.
Here is mutual pledging the Troth to a Fals∣hood,
which is, in short, a premeditated Lye;
like a cold Blood murther, 'tis intended to be
done long before it is done. Here's also a stated,
calm, intended Perjury; a swearing to do what
they own they not only did not intend to
do, but knew beforehand they could not
do.</P>
<P>HOW many kinds of Dishonesty are here
mixt together? Take it in the very first Words
of the Minister, being as an Introduction to the
Office of Matrimony; the Minister adjures
them, as they will answer it at the great and
dreadful Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when the Secrets of all
Hearts shall be revealed, that if they know
<PB N="183" REF="199"/>
any lawful Hindrance or Impediment why they
should not be lawfully joyned together, they
should then declare it, protesting against even
the Validity of the Marriage, in case they
fail.</P>
<P>I Require and charge you both, (as ye will answer
at the dreadful Day of Judgment, when the
Secrets of all Hearts shall be disclosed) that if
either of you know any Impediment, why ye may
not be lawfully joyned together in Matrimony, ye
do now confess it. For be ye well assured, that so
many as are coupled together otherwise than <HI>GOD'S</HI>
Word doth allow, are not joyned together by <HI>GOD,</HI>
neither is their Matrimony lawful.</P>
<P>HEREUPON the Minister giving them time
to answer, they are Silent; that is to say, they
declare no Impediment, which is a tacit de∣claring
that they know of none; and yet, at
the same time, they know that in Conscience
they have settled their Love and Affection upon
another Person; and the Man or Woman they
now marry they cannot love, and ought not on
that Account to marry, because they Promise
what they know they shall not perform.</P>
<P>HOW many times also does the Secret come
out afterwards, either unawares by themselves,
or in delirious Fits, extremities of Distempers,
Dreams, talking in the Sleep, and such other
Ways, which prove however fatal to the Peace
of the Family, yet unavoidable?</P>
<P>SUCH Persons have great Reason to be sure
that they do not talk in their Sleep; for what
the Mind bears such a Weight of upon it, which
indeed it is not equal to, and is not possible to be
supported, thought by a vigilant guarding the
<PB N="184" REF="200"/>
Tongue in the Day-time it shall be kept in,
yet how often will it break out in a Dream,
and the Tongue betray it self in its sleep?</P>
<P>HOW miserable is the Lady, frequently
wishing she was in the Arms of the Man she
loves insread of his Arms, who the is unhap∣pily
tyed to? Those ardent Wishes prompting
her Desires, she falls into a Slumber, and dreams
that it is really so, as she wished it might
be.</P>
<P>IN the transports of her Imagination her
waking Soul commands her Tongue, tho' the
whole Organick Body be laid asleep; I say,
commands the Tongue to tell the dangerous
Truth; she cries out, as in an Extasy, discovers
the Affection, and unhappily names the Man:
The fair—, the Toast of the Town, the
Beauty of the Beauties, had Admirers enongh,
was beloved to Madness and Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raction by a
throng of Admirers; at last, for the sake of
a Settlement, a little more than ordinary large,
she quits the generous <HI>Ca</HI>—, the Lord of her
Affections, the only Man in the World that had
found the Way into her Heart, and to whom
she had made innumerable Vows of Fidelity;
I say, quits him with the utmost Rudeness, and
throws her self at the Importunities and Com∣mands
of her avaritious Parents; I say, throws
her self into the Arms of a mean, a course, an
unbred, half-taught Citizen, the Son of a rich
overgrown Tradesman himself a Clown, only
that he was a Boor of Fortune, can keep her
fine, and cause her to ride in a Coach: And
what then?</P>
<P>SHE marries this Lump of unpolished, sim∣ple
Stuff, and they live Tolerably well for a
Time, when one Night, in a Dream, she fan∣cied
<PB N="185" REF="201"/>
her self in the Arms of her former Lover
pleas'd to a Rapture with what she had so long
Reason to know she could never enjoy; she
flies out even in her Dream to talking aloud;
and not only to talk aloud, tho' fast asleep,
but gives her Tongue a leese into all the most
dangerous Expressions, that Love to the real
Master of her Heart, and the utmost Contempt
of her Jaylor, as she call'd him, meaning her
Husband, could inspire her with: Nor was this
all; for where will Misfortunes End! but in the
highth of her Extasies and with a wicked, tho'
but fancied Liberty, she calls her former
Lover by his Name, and so betrays her self to
her Husband, who hears himself accused of the
worst of Crimes, treated with the worst Con∣tempt,
and the greatest of Indignity put upon
him, in Words at length, that can be thought
of.</P>
<P>HER Husband was not at first well awake,
and so, perhaps, was not let into the first Part
of it; nor was he presently capable of under∣standing
what it all meant: But when he heard
himself abused in so gross a manner, it put
him into a Passion, and he replied rashly to
her, not thinking she had been asleep.</P>
<P>THIS replying to her, unhappily waked
her, or, at leaft so much, as to put a stop to
her talking aloud. Her Husband was presently
aware that his Wife was not awake, and vexed
that he waked her; he lies still a little, till Sleep
overcoming her, and the pleasing Ideas of her
past Loves set her to talking again; when her
Husband subtilly managing himself, spoke
softly at her Ear several Words agreeal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le to
what she had said, and brought her by that
means (as is not impracticable) to answer se∣veral
<PB N="186" REF="202"/>
Questions, and that in such a manner, as
his Patience would bear it no longer.</P>
<P>THIS want of Temper was perhaps her Feli∣city
so far, as that she discovered no more to
him, though she had discovered so much already,
as made an irreconcileable Breach between
them: And first, as he was exasperated to the
highest Degree by what he had heard, and
waked her in a kind of a Passion; he asked
her, what she had been dreaming of?</P>
<P>SHE was not presently come to her self e∣nough
to recollect that it was all a Dream, so that
she made him no Answer for a while; but he
repeating the Question, it soon came into her
Thoughts, that she had dreamed something not
fit to tell him of; so she answered, she had
dreamed of nothing; but he pressing her with
the Question, she said, Did she Dream? why,
if she did, she could not remember it. But
what Confusion was she in, when she heard him
tell her all the particulars of her Dream, as
fairly (almost) as if she had told them her self?</P>
<P>HOWEVER, she insisted that she knew no∣thing
of it; that if she did dream, nothing
was more frequent than for People to dream,
and forget what they dreamt of, and so might
she; for that she knew nothing of it, at the same
time little thinking, nay, not suspecting what
had happened, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that she had been talking in
her Sleep to her former Lover, with all possible
Endearments, and had spoken to him of her Hus∣band
with the utmost Contempt; and she was
confounded again to have her Husband repeat
the very Words which she knew she had dreamed
of.</P>
<P>BUT her Husband, whose Passion drove him
beyond all Bounds, was not satisfied with up∣braiding
<PB N="187" REF="203"/>
her with the Particulars, but told
her, that she had revealed them all her self in
her Sleep, and that she had said so and so to
him, upon his making little short Answers to
her; and offering some Questions, and that, in
short, she had betrayed her own Intrigues; from
whence, he charged her openly with being Dis∣honest,
and with that Person also, and that before
her Marriage to him as well as after, alledging
that it appeared from her own Mouth. Nor
was he prudent enough to conceal the Thing,
and to let it lie as a private Feud between
themselves; but he told it openly and pub∣lickly
among the Neighbours, and in almost
all Company. But he had the worst of the
Quarrel, though he had the better of the Fact,
and that by his want of Conduct too.</P>
<P>THE Women's Wit, they say, never fails
them at a Pinch; 'tis easy to imagine, that his
Wife was in the utmost Confusion at the disco∣very
of the Thing as it was, and especially
while she was at a loss to know which way he
came by his Information; for though she might
easily have supposed that she must have spoke
aloud in her Sleep, yet as she had never known
her self to do so before, she did not think of it
at first, but thought he had dealt with the De∣vil,
and that he must have been with some
Conjurer, who, as she had been told, could, by
the help of the Devil, first make People dream
of what they thought fit to inject into their
Thoughts, and then tell of it to whom they
thought fit.</P>
<P>THIS filled her with Indignation at her Hus∣band,
for having, as she affirmed, bewitched
her, and employed the Devil to betray her into
Mischief, and then betray that Mischief; and
<PB N="188" REF="204"/>
she resolved to give him a home Charge upon
the Subject, and threaten to bring him upon
the publick Stage for Inchantment and Sor∣cery.</P>
<P>BUT he put a better Invention into her Head;
for unwarily he threw it out, that he heard
her talk in her Sleep, and that he ask'd her such
and such Questions, by whispering in her Ear,
and that she answered so and so.</P>
<P>IT immediately occurred to her, that if this
was all he had for it, he was but one Affirma∣tive,
and no Witness in his own Case, and that
her Negative might go as far as his Affirmative;
that she had no more to do but to deny the Fact;
that as to the Story of whispering Questions,
and her answering them, the Pretence was a No∣velty;
and so strange, that tho' it might be true,
no Body would believe it, especially if she
firmly denied it.</P>
<P>UPON this she began with him; told him,
she had perceived a good while his jealous and
uneasy Humour, and that he had laid a great
many Plots and Designs to attack her Reputation,
and all to find an Excuse to justify his ill Usage
of her; but that her Conduct was such before
the whole World, that no Body would believe
him; and that now he had dress'd up a Story
between the Devil and him, to fix something
upon her, if possible; but that it was an evi∣dent
Forgery of his own, with the help of his
Witchcraft: And as the Story was it self impro∣bable,
and next to impossible, so she declared
it was a Lie, and she defied the Devil and
him, they might both do their worst.</P>
<P>SHE gave him this so Roundly, and with such
Assurance, and told it also so publickly, (as he
did his Story) that the Man began to find she
<PB N="189" REF="205"/>
had the better of him; that People began to
think her ill used; that he was only jealous of
her, and that he had made this Story to blast
her Character, and to justify his own Jealousies;
then as to the whispering Story, every Body
said it looked like a Forgery indeed, and no
Body believed a Word of it, for it seemed impro∣bable;
so that the Husband began to talk less of
the Matter than before, and was sensible that
she was too hard for him.</P>
<P>BUT the more he began to give out, the
more furiously she followed her Blow; for she
not only told her Tale, as above, but she em∣ployed
two or three Emissaries to hand it about
among the Ladies at the Tea Table, and a∣mong
the Gossips; and the Man, in a word,
got such an ill Name, that he was the Contempt
of all his Neighbours.</P>
<P>NOR did she End here; but she added her
former Design to the latter: And, first, she se∣parated
from him at home, or, as 'tis usually
express'd, they parted Beds; in short, she told
him, that it was reported there were Magicians
and Fellows that dealt with the <HI>Devil,</HI> who,
they said, by the help of Evil Spirits, could
cause People to dream what and when they
pleased, and to talk in their Sheep, and that
she understood her Husband had been conversing
with some of those cunning Men, as they call'd
them, in order to make the Experiment upon
her, by whispering Things in her Ear while
she was asleep, and so making her Dream so and
so, and then report, that she talked of those
Things in her sleep, in order to expose her.</P>
<P>THAT therefore she would lie by her self,
for she would not lie in Bed with one that
would bring the Devil into the Room, to ex∣pose
<PB N="190" REF="206"/>
and betray her; that she would have her
Maid lie with her every Night, that she might
have good Witness of her Conduct; but that
she would not trust her self any more to sleep
with one that would betray her to the Devil,
and then to all the World.</P>
<P>THIS she not only told her Husband, but
told it to all her Friends and Tea Table Emis∣saries;
and the Story was so plausible in its
kind, and was told so much to her Advantage,
that every Body justify'd her Conduct, said
she was in the right, that she could do no less,
and that no Woman in her Senses would sleep
in Bed with a Man who was able to do such
Things as those; and that, in short, it was all
one as to sleep with the Devil.</P>
<P>THE Man had no Remedy but to deny the
Charge, and to say he never had any thing to
do with the Devil, or with any such People as
Conjurers, Magicians, or any such Sort of
Folks, in his life. But all that went but a little
Way, for who would not deny it if they were
the most guilty of any in the World; but the
Woman vouched that so and so he had said, and
such and such Things he had pretended; that
he could not do so without the help of the Devil;
and that therefore it was not safe for her, by
any means, to trust her self with him.</P>
<P>THUS the guilty Wife got the Victory over
the innocent Husband, by the meer dexterity of
her Wit, and the Conduct of her Allies, not
forgetting the assistance of a Publick Clamour;
the Man himself, at the same time, was not
famed for overmuch Sense or Conduct in this,
or other Things, and therefore was the easier
managed by a keen witted Wife. But the Infe∣rence
from the whole Discourse comesin perfectly
<PB N="191" REF="207"/>
adapted to the Argument which it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is brought
to confirm, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that to love one Person, be
it Man or Woman, and then marry another, is
neither honest to the Person quitted, or to the
Person married, but especially not to the last,
and more especially not honest to the Person
herself or himself; in a word, it is not an ho∣nest
Marriage; for the engaged Affection is a
just Impediment, and ought to have been de∣clared
and discovered at the Book, upon the De∣claration
appointed to be made by the Minister,
as above, or before they came so far.</P>
<P>AS for the Success of such Marriages, the
Blessing attending them, and what Happiness
is to be expected from them, it seems to be laid
open in Part, in the little History just recited;
but 'tis really visible to common Experience in
almost every Age and Place in the World, I
mean our <HI>English</HI> World.</P>
<P>WHAT Delight, what Complaisance can
there be in that Matrimony, where the Heart
did not go with the Hand? where the Marriage
may be said to be made from the Teeth out∣ward,
and no more? where the Love is fixed in
one Place, and the Bed made in another? What
is this but a fraudulent Contract, a Protesta∣tion,
with a design to deceive, which, by the
Way, is the very Essence of a LYE, and one of
the worst Kind too?</P>
<P>WHAT Complaisance or Pleasure in their
Enjoyments of any kind, between the unhappy
Couple, and how can it be called a fair Mar∣riage?
Two swear to love, and at the same time
both know they neither do or can; that they
neither desire it or intend it, and they come to
the Book, two Carcasses without Souls, without
assent or consent, but in meer subjection to
<PB N="192" REF="208"/>
Circumstances enter into a horrid Slavery; the
Woman dragged by her old Grandmother, or
her thundering and threatning Parent, because
the Miser can give her a Portion, or not give
it her, as he pleases; can make her a Fortune or
a Chamber-maid, a Lady or a Shoemaker's
Wife. Under these Terrors and Obligations,
she does as she's bid, and marries any Body
they please, let him have Wit, Sense and Man∣ners,
or neither Wit, Sense or Manners: As she
is pre-engaged, and her Affections look quite
another Way, the thoughts of this Marriage
are her Abhorrence, her Aversion, and yet she
marries him. What must we call this? Is it
Matrimony? No, no; it has nothing of Matri∣mony
in it but the Form; 'tis all a Cheat;
they lie to one another when they repeat the
Words; and they both know they do so, nay, they
intend to do so; as to the Consequence, you have
it before, between Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> and my Lady
—But as to the Fact, 'tis horrid in its
Nature; they are but two Victims, I cannot
indeed, in one Sense, call them Prostitutes;
but they are prostituted by the governing Re∣lations,
brought together by the arbitrary Au∣thority
of those that have the Influence over
them: Here, says the old Father with a lordly
Air to his Son, take this young Woman to
Church, and marry her; perhaps the Debate
has been between them before about loving her
or not loving her, and the young Man has
told him positively, he hates her, or that he
can't love her. But 'tis all one, the old Man
likes the Settlement, and tells him in so many
Words, that if he won't take her, his Brother
shall, and shall have his Estate too.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="209"/>
I could name so many Examples of this kind,
and give you an Account of so many Families
ruined by it, that it would tire you in the
reading. But give me leave to single out one
for your Remark, which, though the Case was
nearer home, you must allow me to place at
some Distance, that the particular Families
may not be marked out and exposed. Suppose
then the Scene in <HI>France,</HI> not far from a great
City, not the greatest but the greatest City but
one in the Kingdom: A certain rich Merchant
had two Sons, and though he had a very great
Estate, it was of his own Purchasing, so that
there was no Entail upon it, and he was there∣fore
at liberty to give it to which of his Sons he
pleased.</P>
<P>HIS eldest Son was a young Gentleman of
good Sense, and a very agreeable Person, and
his Father had bestowed some Charge upon his
Education, had given him learning and good
Breeding, to qualify him, as he said, for the
Life of a Gentleman, and, as he usually ex∣pressed
it, to make him know how to live agree∣able
to the Fortune he was able to give him;
but withal, the Father kept him pretty much
in Subjection; and the more, by making him
always sensible how much it was in his Power
to make him a Gentleman or a Beggar, that is
to say, to give him an Estate, and make him
live like a Gentleman, or turn him loose in
the World to seek his Fortune.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY, the Father was often re∣peating
to his Son, how he expected that he
should conform himself to his Meaures in tak∣ing
a Wife, and that if he did not, he would ab∣solutely
disinherit him, and give his Estate to
his younger Brother.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="210"/>
WHETHER this absolute Declaration of the
Father, did not, in some manner, influence the
Son, so as to create, with the aversion to the
Tyranny of it, a kind of dislike to every thing
the Father could propose, I cannot say; per∣haps
there might be something of that kind in
it too, for Nature abhors Violence in Love.</P>
<P>BUT however it was, this is certain, that
when his Father proposed a Match to him, he
did it with an Air of Authority; told him, he
had pitched upon such a Family, where he
knew there was a suitable Fortune; that it was
a very advantagious Alliance, and that he had
already discoursed with the Lady's Father, and
he found Things were very well, and that
every Thing would be to his mind, and
therefore he would have him think of marrying
her.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>says the Son,</HI> you will please to let
me see the Lady, I hope.</P>
<P>WHY, says the <HI>Father,</HI> what if you should
not see her till afterwards, there's no great
Matter in that? I suppose you know it is in
such a Province, and she will be sent to <HI>Paris,</HI>
(<HI>London</HI>) after the Contract is signed, and there
you may marry her.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, must I marry her unsight, un∣seen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, didn't the King marry the

<P>But, SIR, they did not love them the

<P>I cannot think, SIR, of marrying by
Proxy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are willing, I find, to give me
more trouble than you need. What, must I
bring the Lady up to Town on purpose for you
to see her, and see whether you like her? What
Occasion is there for that? I assure you, like
her, or not like her, you are like to take her, or
you and I shall differ upon an Article that will
be very disagreeable to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I'll not give you or the Lady
that trouble; I'll go down into the Country, if
you please, and see her there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, I'll give you my Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Answer; what d'ye mean by that?
I assure you, I shall not come into your Notions,
(viz.) of giving you a negative Voice; The Set∣tlements
are agreed on, and are sufficient to
make you both happy, and to make you live
like a Gentleman all your Days. Do you think
these are not infinitely of more Consequence
than what you call pleasing your loose Fancy?
I hope my eldest Son won't be a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, if you will not give me a
negative Voice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I will not, what then? Why, I
will not, for I cannot; 'tis ridiculous for you to
pretend to dislike, where such a Fortune is set∣tled
on<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here the Father began to be angry, and added some Threatnings to him, and particularly that his second Bro∣ther should have her, and all his Estate, so the young Gen∣tleman complied.</NOTE> you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="196" REF="212"/>
<SPEAKER>Son.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, I cannot tell what to say; if
you will have it be so, it must be so; then I
need not go indeed.</P>
<P>UPON this, the young Man yielded, and the
Contracts being finished, they were married by
Proxy, as great Men are; but the Consequence
was, that he went to another Lady whom he
loved, and had been in love with for some
Years, and letting her know the Distress he was
in, they consulted together what to do; and
the result was this, they went together, and
were privately married, and the Marriage fairly
consummated, at least a Month before the other,
and confirmed by good and substantial Wit∣nesses.</P>
<P>BUT concealing it entirely from his Father,
he wickedly went and married the other Lady
too, in publick; by which indeed, he obtained
an irreversible Settlement of his Father's Estate;
so that when it came to a disovery, his Father
could not take it away again, or disinherit
him, the Estate being fully and fairly set∣tled.</P>
<P>THE Lady was indeed grosly injured and
abused, for though she was fairly married, yet
he was not; and upon a long, and to him,
shameful Hearing, in a Court of Justice, the
first Woman was declared his lawful Wife, only
the other being left to take her Remedy against
him at Law, which yet she would not do.</P>
<P>BUT the Consequence did not End here; for
the Gentleman carried it so obligingly to her
who he had not loved, and managed so dex∣trously,
with her who he had both loved and
married, that he brought them to consent to
Poligamy, and they both lived with him, and
<PB N="197" REF="213"/>
that in one House too; he kept them indeed
separate Apartments, and different Servants,
but they carried it very well to one another,
and lived easy, there being a plentiful Fortune
among them.</P>
<P>BUT even in this best Side of the Story,
what a Complication of Mischiess was here?
Here was Matrimonial Whoredom in the very
Letter of it, and all introduced by a force upon
Affection, (1.) By the Father unjustly forcing
his Son to marry a Woman he did not love. (2.)
By the Son wickedly cheating his Father in a
seeming scandalous Compliance to get the
Estate. (3.) By the Son again, basely and injuri∣ously
marrying a virtuous Lady, imposing him∣self
upon her as a single Man, when he was
already married to another Woman. And, lastly,
by living in open Adultery, and keeping them
both.</P>
<P>I could, as I have said, load you with Sto∣ries
of this kind, I mean, of the forcing young
People to marry against Inclination, and con∣trary
to secret Obligation, and especially con∣trary
to pre-ingaged Affections: But I must
give you this Observation upon them, which,
in effect, is equal to the repeating them, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that they would be almost every one of them
tragical; especially if you will allow to have
the destroying all the Comforts of Life, and all
the Enjoyment that could be expected in the
State of Marriage, be reckoned tragical; which
indeed I do allow, and every whit as tragical as
cutting of Throats.</P>
<P>TO cross the Affections of young People
in Marriage, especially where the proposed
Object is not scandalous or extreamly de∣spicable,
is, I think, a little synonimous to
<PB N="198" REF="214"/>
Murther; it is a wilful Violence upon the
Mind, and that, I think, equal or superior to a
Violence upon the Body; it is a formal Ra∣vishment
upon Virtue, and that in so much
the worse a manner, as it is done under the
Form of Justice and Law, and is still made
worse, in that it is without a Remedy.</P>
<P>IF Violence is offered to the Chastity of a
Woman, she has her recourse to the Law, and
she will be redress'd as far as redress can be ob∣tained.
Where the Fact is irretrievable, the
Man should be punished, and the Woman is
protected by the Law from any farther Force
upon her for the future. But here the Woman
is put to Bed to the Man by a kind of forced
Authority of Friends; 'tis a Rape upon the
Mind; her Soul, her brightest Faculties, her
Will, her Affections are ravished, and she is
left without redress, she is left in the Pos∣session
of the Ravisher, or of him, who, by
their Order, she was delivered up to, and she
is bound in the Chains of the same Violence for
her whole life.</P>
<P>HORRID abuse! Here is a sacred Institution
violated, and, as I may say, prophaned; an un∣just
Violence offered to Chastity and Modesty
on one hand, and to Honesty on the other;
who marries by the importuning Authority of
the Parent, contrary to solemn and secret En∣gagements
pass'd to another, contrary to Incli∣nation,
and contrary to pre-ingaged Affections,
and, at last, contrary to Law.</P>
<P>IS not here a Matrimonial Whoredom? I
think, if it allows any alteration in the Word,
it is for the worse, and it should rather be called
a Matrimonial Adultery. Nor is it very unu∣sual
for these Sorts of Matches to be pleaded as
<PB N="199" REF="215"/>
Excuses for all the wicked Excursions which are
made after Marriage, either by one Side or
other: The Man hangs about the Woman he
loved before, follows her even after he is mar∣ried
to another; tells her, she is the <HI>Wife of his
Affection,</HI> the other is only his <HI>Wife in Law,</HI> and
by Form; that he still faithful, and has re∣served
his Heart for her, though he has given
his Hand to the other, who he is cruelly bound
to call Wife.</P>
<P>IT is not long since we had a publick Ex∣ample
of this, and that in the highest Class of
Dignity, and where the Lady insisted upon her
being as lawful a Wife, and as strictly Virtuous
as the fairly and openly married Possessor; and
even in the very Article of Death, resused to
acknowledge it a Crime. But I would not, I
say, bring Examples too near home, where they
are publickly known, nor revive the Mistakes,
which should rather be buried in the Grave
with the Persons mistaken.</P>
<P>FORCING to marry, is, in the plain Conse∣quences,
not only a forcing to Crime, but fur∣nishing
an Excuse to Crime; I do not say, 'tis
a just Excuse, for nothing can be a just Excuse
for an unjust Action; but 'tis furnishing a
plausible Pretence, to such Persons especially,
who were but indifferently furnished with Vir∣tue
before, to justify the Excursions of their
Vice: Now as a Man who is forced by any undue
Restraint to enter into Obligations of Debt,
give Bonds, Judgments, and such like Acknow∣ledgments,
meerly to obtain his Liberty, shall
plead that Force in Bar of any Prosecution up∣on
those Obligations; and the Law will allow
the Plea, especially where the Debt also is
just; so these Men plead the Breach made up∣on
<PB N="200" REF="216"/>
their Inclinations to justify the Breaches
they make upon the lawful Restraints both of
Human or Divine Laws, but with not the like
Justice in the Plca.</P>
<P>IT was a very unhappy Dialogue between a
young Gentleman, and a neighbouring Clergy∣man,
which I lately came to the knowledge of
upon this very Subject, and which being much
to the same Purpose as my present Argument
points out, may not be improper here.</P>
<P>THE young Gentleman had been dragged into
such a Marriage, <HI>as I have just now mentioned,</HI> by
the positive Command and Authority of a <HI>rich
Uncle,</HI> who had a great Estate to give, and who
had fixed upon his Nephew as his next Heir,
being his Brother's only Son; it seems this
Uncle had declared, he would make the young
Man his Heir, if he married to his Mind.</P>
<P>THE young Gentleman was too wise not to
oblige his Uncle in every thing he could; but
in this of Love he was very unkindly cross'd
by the old Man, and indeed very unjustly too.
The Case, as I received the Account, was as
follows:</P>
<P>THERE was a young Lady in the Neighbour∣hood,
who the old Man had proposed to this
Nephew to marry; and her Fsiends being con∣tent
to treat about it, the Terms of Estate and
Settlements were agreed between them, and the
Writings were ordered to be drawn; for that
Lady had no inconsiderable Fortune neither;
in the mean time, the Gentleman was admitted
to wait upon the young Lady, (and, which does
not often fall out indeed, where the Choice is
made first by Grandfathers and Uncles, as was
the Case here) they agreed; liked one anothes
mighty well, and it went on even to loving one
<PB N="201" REF="217"/>
another, and that violently. In the mean time
something presented it self with more Fortune,
and the Uncle takes upon him to change his
Mind, imposing the change too upon his Ne∣phew,
and so breaks off the Match; obliging
him to go and wait upon a new Mistress, and
this without so much as a Pretence of any other
Objection, than that of a larger Portion offer∣ing
in another. The young Gentleman was
exceedingly disgusted at the Proposal, and used
all possible Arguments with his Uncle, and em∣ployed
all his Friends to persuade him to let
the first Match go forward, as it had been car∣ried
on such a length, that he could not go off
with Honour or Satisfaction to himself, the
young Lady and he being mutually engaged in
Affections as well as Interests.</P>
<P>BUT the old Man was inflexible and arbi∣trary,
would not hear of any Reasons, but
would be obeyed; and as for Affections, and
such trifles as these, he slighted them to the last
Degree, as things of no Consequence at all in
the Case: Well, the young Gentleman had no
Remedy; he was obliged, though with infinite
Reluctance, to abandon his Mistress, a Lady of
Merit and Beauty, Fortune and good Breed∣ing,
and every thing agreeable to him; and
turn his Eyes where his Uncle directed, with∣out
any regard to all these, or to his own Incli∣nation.
But he did not do this without ac∣quainting
the Lady with the Force that was
put upon him, and letting her know his un∣happy
Circumstances; offering to relinquish
all the hopes of his Uncle's Fortune and Fa∣vour,
and take her at all Hazards. But. her
Friends would not agree to that; nor would
she consent without her Father, for then they
<PB N="202" REF="218"/>
might have been both Beggars. This being the
Case, they parted, but with mutual Assurances
however of Affection, and of a farther Union,
if the Uncle could be brought to any com∣pliance.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all, for now the Uncle
proposes the new Match to him, and sends him
to wait upon the Lady. He had, with great
difficulty, complied with the old Gentleman in
the quitting the first Lady, who was Mistress
of a thousand good Qualities, as well as of a
good Fortune. But when he came to this new
proposed Creature, his Stomach turned at the
very Sight of her: She was not deformed in∣deed,
but far from handsome; she had neither
Wit or Manners, good Humour or good Breed∣ing,
beauty of Body or beauty of Mind; in a
word, she was every way disagreeable, only that
she had a vast Fortune.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the Uncle, that was as Arbi∣trary
in the <HI>Negative</HI> before, was as Tyrannick
in the <HI>Affirmative</HI> now; and without troubling
you with the many Disputes between the Un∣cle
and the Nephew upon that Head; his En∣treaties,
his humble Petitions against the
Match, declaring (as he himself said) to his
Uncle, that he had much rather be hang'd; yet
he obliged him to take her, and take her he did,
being loth to lose an Estate of near Two thou∣sand
Pounds a Year, besides Money, and, which
was worse, having no other Dependence in the
World.</P>
<P>AFTER he was married, that is to say, cou∣pled,
for he often declared 'twas no lawful Mar∣riage,
but a Violence upon him; he made as
bad a Husband as any woman that knows she
has nothing to be beloved for, and knows the
<PB N="203" REF="219"/>
Man hates her when he takes her, could ex∣pect:
For being thus tyed to the four Apple
Tree, married to his Aversion, and separated
from the Object of his Affection, he abandoned
himself to Company, to Wine, to Play, and at
last to Women, and all kinds of Excess.</P>
<P>A Pious and Reverend Minister, not of his
Parish, but of a neighbouring Parish, and of
which the Gentleman was Patron, frequently
took Opportunities to talk seriously to him
upon the sad Subject of his extravagant Life,
and with a Christian plainness; tho' with decency
and respect too, especially as he was his Patron,
he often press'd him to take up, to reform, and,
at lest, to regulate his Morals.</P>
<P>THE Gentleman took all his Admonitions
in good Part; but told him in so many
Words, 'twas his Uncle had ruined him, Soul
and Body; that he had a sober Education, and
was as promising a young Fellow as any in the
Country, till his Uncle ruined him, by forcing
him to marry against his Will; Forcing him
to abandon a Lady that he loved, and whose
very Example added to the Influence she would
have had upon his Affections, was enough to
have kept him within Bounds all his Days; and
then he related all the Circumstances of his
Match, as I have related them above.</P>
<P>IN vain the good Minister urged the Chri∣stian
Arguments of Duty, the Command of
GOD, the Scandal to his Person, the Ruin of
his Fortunes, and all the other Arguments
which Religion and Reason furnish so fully on
such Occasions. His Answer was, What can I
do; I have no Retreat, my Family is a <HI>Bedlam;</HI>
I have no Body there to receive me but a She∣Devil,
always raving, and always quarrelling;
<PB N="204" REF="220"/>
that is neither quiet with Master or Servants,
or even with her self; that has not one good
Feature to render her agreeable, or one good
Humour to render her tolerable? To be at
home, says he, is odious to me, but to dwell
there is intolerable; the Family is to me an
Hospital to look into, but would be a Jayl to
be confined to. Had I married the Woman I
loved, said he, I had been as sober as I had
been happy.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, says the <HI>good Man,</HI> Religion is
not to depend upon relative Circumstances, and
we are not to serve GOD, as we have, or have
not a comfortable Family.</P>
<P>THAT'S true, <HI>says the Gentleman.</HI> But who
can be religious in Hell? Who can think of
GOD, or any thing that is good, when he is
bound to Converse with every thing that's
bad?</P>
<P>SUCH things are very afflicting indeed, <HI>says
the grave Divine;</HI> but Afflictions should rather
guide us to Heaven, than drive us from it. I
have heard it spoken of in jest, That a bad
Wife will lead a Man to Heaven.</P>
<P>AND I speak of it in earnest, <HI>says the Gentle∣man,</HI>
that mine will drive me to the Devil.</P>
<P>O, Sir, <HI>says the Minister, being greatly troubled
to hear him talk at that rate,</HI> do not say so, I be∣seech
you; you ought rather to consider it as
an Affliction, and humble your Mind under it.
But running out into Crime is heaping up Mi∣sery,
and making bad worse.</P>
<P>WHY, what can I do, Sir? <HI>says he.</HI> Who can
tye himself down to his mortal Aversion?</P>
<P>THERE are many Christian Methods, <HI>says the
Minister,</HI> which you may apply your self to,
<PB N="205" REF="221"/>
Sir, to make the Burthen lighter to you than it
seems to be now.</P>
<P>WHAT are they, <HI>says the Gentleman;</HI> I don't
see into it; 'tis imposhble to help me, unless
some Miracle would intervene to deliver
me.</P>
<P>YES, yes, <HI>says the heavenly Counsellor,</HI> there
are Ways: Pray to GOD, as you do at Church
for your Enemies, that he would turn her
Heart.</P>
<P>TURN her! says the Gentlemen. Pray to
GOD to give me Courage to turn her out of
Doors, and take in that blessed Creature I
lov'd.</P>
<P>THAT can't be now, Sir, <HI>said the Minister,</HI>
you must not pray to GOD to allow you to Sin
against him.</P>
<P>WHY then, <HI>says he,</HI> laughing, shall I pray to
GOD to send the Devil for her.</P>
<P>THE good Man could hardly forbear smil∣ing
at the Expression, but recovered him∣self,
and said, Your smile tells me, Sir, you are
speaking in Jest; so, I suppose, you don't ex∣pect
I should answer that Question.</P>
<P>I know not what to say, it's half in Jest,
half in Earnest. If it should be so, I don't
know how I should be Hypocrite enough to
cry for her.</P>
<P>SIR, says the <HI>Minister,</HI> I beg of you let us
talk of nothing Prophane; you know we are
to pray for our worst Enemies.</P>
<P>NAY, she's my worst Enemy, that's true,
<HI>says he;</HI> but I can't promise to pray for her, and
I'm sure I can never forgive her.</P>
<P>WHY so, Sir, <HI>says the Divine,</HI> you are strictly
commanded to forgive.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="222"/>
BUT not to forgive her, <HI>says he,</HI> because she
never says, <HI>I repent,</HI> as the Scripture says, my
Brother must do, or else I am not bound to for∣give
him.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>says the Divine,</HI> you mistake the
Text; you are bound to forgive your Enemies
upon the Penalty of not being forgiven, and
in the Command the Condition of his Repent∣ance
is not included.</P>
<P>I don't know, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> your Doc∣trine
may be good, but I can't promise that I
can observe the Rule; 'tis not in the Power of
Nature to bear the Weight; it is unsuffer∣able.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> there is no need
to run out to Excesses and Immoralities, because
of a disagreeable Wife.</P>
<P>SIR, says the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> there's need to go
abroad, when a Man can't stay at home.</P>
<P>I beg, Sir, <HI>says the good Reprover,</HI> you'll con∣sider
whether reforming your self would not re∣form
your Wife.</P>
<P>I don't know as to that, <HI>says the Gentleman;</HI>
but what if it should, I should be perhaps a
little more quiet, but not at all more happy.</P>
<P>HOW do you mean? Sir, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> I
don't understand that.</P>
<P>WHY, what signifies reforming her, <HI>says the
Gentleman;</HI> I hate her. If she was as religious
as a Nun, and as holy as an Angel, it would be
the same thing; she is my Aversion.</P>
<P>NOW you have discovered the Matter, <HI>says
the Minister,</HI> and the Truth is out; you must
then change your Work, and instead of praying
for your Wife, pray for your self.</P>
<P>WHAT can I pray for, <HI>says the Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="223"/>
SAYS the good <HI>Director,</HI> pray to GOD to turn
your Aversions into a just Affection to your
Wife.</P>
<P>WHAT, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> must I pray to
GOD to make me love the Devil.</P>
<P>No, Sir, but to make you love your Wife;
and if you lov'd her as you do her you lost, you
would not see half so many Faults in her as
you do now.</P>
<P>IT is not to be done, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> 'tis
against Nature. Was ever any Gentleman in
love with a Monster? I might pray to GOD,
indeed, to metamorphose her, to turn the Devil
into an Angel, Deformity into Beauty, Black
into White; but I have no Rule set me to au∣thorize
such a Petition.</P>
<P>YOU are sadly exasperated, Sir, against your
Wife, says the good Man with a melancholy
Air. Why! I have seen your Lady; she is no
Monster, no deformed Person, no Blackmoor;
'tis very sad to hear you talk thus.</P>
<P>No, no; though she's far from a Beauty, <HI>says
the Gentleman,</HI> yet she's no Monster, I don't mean
so; but she's a Monster in her Condition; she
has a deformed Mind, a black Soul; there's no∣thing
in her but what would oblige a Man to
hate her.</P>
<P>YOU don't love her, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> that's
the greatest Misforuune of it all.</P>
<P>NO, no, that's true, I don't love her to be
sure, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> who could?</P>
<P>IT is a dreadful thing, <HI>says the serious good
Man,</HI> you should marry a Lady of Fortune,
and have such an Averfion to her. You must
of necessity, Sir, repent of it, and reform it, or
it may Ruin you for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="224"/>
NAY, Sir, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> I have repent∣ed
enough, if that will help me; I have re∣pented
from the first Moment. But as to re∣forming,
I don't know what to say to that.</P>
<P>WHY then, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> you have ru∣ined
your self; GOD help you, and assist you to
change your Thoughts.</P>
<P>NO, no, Sir, <HI>replies he,</HI> 'twas my Uncle
ruined me; he knows it by this time; he mur∣thered
me; he suffers for it, I doubt not, be∣fore
now. I am undone indeed, but I had no
hand in it my self.</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> be pleased to
consider the manner of Life you lead now.
These Things are sad, and I lament your Con∣dition
heartily. But a bad Wife is no excuse
for a bad Life.</P>
<P>I tell you, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> there's no liv∣ing
a good Life with her, so I should be damn'd
if I stayed at home; for I must be always fight∣ing
and raging; I must live as some Drunkards
do, with their Heads always hot. Who can stay
at home with the Devil?</P>
<P>BUT, Sir, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> even living a∣broad,
as you call it, you need not live an irn∣moral
Life; there are Gentlemen who have
disagreeable Families, that do not presently
run out into Excesses of Vice and Immora∣lity.</P>
<P>WHAT,
<HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> about Women,
you mean, I suppose that's all.</P>
<P>BUT that is Adultery, Sir, <HI>says the Minister,</HI>
which is a dreadful thing to be thought of.</P>
<P>WHY as to that, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> my Uncle
must answer for it; he made me commit Adul∣tory,
I could not help it.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="225"/>
I don't understand how that can be, Sir, <HI>says
the good Minister.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, 'twas all Adultery; the very Mar∣riage
was but a civil Whoring; 'twas all Adul∣tery
from the beginning; I was a married Man
before.</P>
<P>AY, Sir, <HI>says the Minister,</HI> there must be
more in that then by a great deal than ever I
understood before.</P>
<P>NO, nothing more than you knew too; I
say, 'twas a Civil Adultery, a Matrimonial
Whoredom, to marry this Woman; for I be∣longed
to another Woman, our Souls were mar∣ried;
we were united by the strictest Bonds of
Faith and Honour; 'twas all breaking into the
Rules of Justice, and the strictest Obligations
that it was possible to lay upon one another;
'twas all Perjury and Adultery of the worst
Sort. That old Wretch, my Uncle, made me
an Adulterer, and 'tis but the same Sin conti∣nued
in.</P>
<P>YOU really fright me, Sir, <HI>says the minister</HI>
Why, this is a terrible Case: How could your
Uncle force you? And why did not you declare
at the Book, as you ought to have done, that
you knew a lawful Impediment why you
should not be joined together, for that you were
firmly engaged to another, and the other to
you; I dare say no Divine of our Church would
have married you.</P>
<P>O, Sir, there was a Reason for that too, <HI>says
the Gentleman,</HI> a Reason that no Body could
withstand; a Reason enforced with an Estate of
two thousand Pounds a Year; and the Reason
all in the Power of a Tyrant, deaf to all Rea∣sonings
but that of Money; in short, there's
the Reason that has undone me, and that made
<PB N="210" REF="226"/>
an Adulterer of me. What signifies it what I do
now?</P>
<P>'TIS a dismal Case, Sir, <HI>says the Minister;</HI>
but I beseech you to consider the Crime is not
to be continued in and encreased; and if you
sinned in Marrying, you have the less need to
sin after Marriage. All evil Courses are to be
repented of, and broken off.</P>
<P>HERE the Minister, went on serious, like
himself, and made very earnest Applications to
him to change his Course of Life. But as that
Part is remote from our present Purpose, I omit
the repetition. Thus far is suited to the Case
before me, <HI>namely,</HI> the miserable Consequences of
Marriages entered into contrary to pre-ingaged
Affections; forced Matches made by Rela∣tions,
for the meer sake of Money, without re∣gard
to the Obligations that may be subsisting
at the same time, and without regard to the
Affection and Inclination of the Parties con∣cerned.
Who can call such Matches lawful
Marriages? And what is the submitting to
them less than a Matrimonial Whoredom?</P>
<P>AS to the Matrimony that passes among
Princes, Kings, Emperors, and such like, as I
said at first, they seem to me to be rather Alli∣ances
and Political Agreements than Marri∣ages,
in which the Conjugal Affection is not
considered as a material, or not as the most ma∣terial
Part. The Love of Princes is managed
in a higher and superior Way; it seems to be
a Consequence of that Marriage, not a Cause or
Reason of it; and, for ought I know, as it is not
often so extraordinary as in private Persons, so
it is not so very often quite wanting; the Dig∣nity
and Quality of the Person has a great In∣fluence
upon their Behaviour, and, if they re∣ally
<PB N="211" REF="227"/>
have not abundance of Love, they often
carry it as if they had an Excess of good Hu∣mour
and Complaisance, which makes up a some∣thing
almost equivalent to Love; and they are
not so miserable in the deficiency as meaner
People are.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, they have their Unhappinesses
too, and as they are not without their Uneasi∣nesses,
when the want of a mutual Affection
breaks out, and gets the mastery of their Civi∣lities;
so, on the other hand, where an entire
agreeing Affection meets in Persons of that
high Rank, how superior is their Felicity to
that of other People! How glorious is their
Peace! How beautiful the conjugal Figure!
HOW happy is the Life of such a Pair! So
great an Addition is a mutual Affection to the
happiness of Life, even in Persons of the
highest Rank; it adds a Lustre to their Glory,
and is, notwithstanding all other good Circum∣stances,
the brightest Beam in all their illustri∣ous
Enjoyments. Such was the Life of two
glorious Sisters, the late Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and
Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> of whom it is said, and I never
heard it contradicted, that they were entire
Mistresses of their Royal Consorts Affections,
Queens of their Hearts, enjoyed a compleat
conjugal Felicity, and furnished back the same
Joy, making full Returns in kind. Nor is it
the least Part of their Fame. But then it may
be added to both those happy Couples, and
which yet confirms what I am arguing upon,
that they saw and loved before they married.
They neither courted by Pictures, or married by
Proxy; their Princes came over hither to view,
chuse, and approve, and then married the Per∣sons
they chose; they courted in Person, and so,
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
I think, all should do that expect to enjoy in
Person.</P>
<P>How happy is it, and how good has Provi∣dence
been, in directing human Affairs, that
Matrimonial Love is a common Blessing! that
the most perfect Enjoyment, and that which
alone compleats all Enjoyments, and finishes the
Happiness of Life, is an Enclosure laid open
by the merciful Disposition of Heaven, for all
his Creatures to share of; and the meanest ho∣nest
Man, who is not press'd with Poverty, is
oftentimes as compleatly happy, and always as
capable of being so, as the greatest Prince, I
mean, as to his conjugal Happiness.</P>
<P>SUITABLE Society is a heavenly Life. Take
a view of Family Disorders; Houshold Strife
and Contention, and join but to these the Ma∣trimonial
Vices I speak of, and you make the
House a Hell, where Rage and Crime constitute
the Place, and where the Flame burns without
consuming, though not without encreasing; and
where the Offences encrease the Punishment,
and the Punishment encreases the Offence. But
we must proceed.</P>

Desires, Aversions, Ends and Aims, should
all agree; and, above all, that even where they
clash and disagree, yet there is no absolute neces∣sity
that they should interrupt the felicity of Life,
make Matrimony a kind of Damnation, the
House a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and the Conversation a Hell,
a State of Strife, Rage, Fury, and eternal Con∣tention.
All this I grant.</P>
<P>BUT if they shall add, that therefore these
things are Trifles, are of no Moment; that they
are not worth interrupting the other Views of
Matrimony, and that they are to be referred to
after Discretion on both Sides. He that shall
talk thus seriously, all I can say to him is, I
am sorry for his Head. It is true, that Pru∣dence
will go a great Way towards reconciling
unsuitable Things; and Christians will learn
by the Christian Law to abate on both Sides,
<HI>forbearing one another in love.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, I'll go farther: Continual Jarrings in
Families sometimes find a Time of Truce, and
the Husband and Wife, like two Combatants,
wearied with Blows, lie still and take Breath.
But alas, what is this! 'tis but to recover
Strength for a more furious Rencounter; the
lucid Intervals being over, the Fire rekindles;
the Passions break out and burn with the more
Force, the Rage is redoubled; and we may say
<PB N="215" REF="231"/>
of such, as the Scripture says in another Case,
<HI>The last End of those Families is worse than the
Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>THE Inequalities then, and unsuitable Things
from whence these Feuds take life, and are
kindled up to a Flame, are far from Trifles;
the Fire of houshold Strife burns <HI>to the lowest
Hell;</HI> 'tis an unquenchable Flame; 'tis kindled
in Trifles; that may be, and is often true.
But those Trifles set the Fire, and nothing but
a Wisdom, more than is generally to be found
in human Nature, can extinguish it.</P>
<P>THESE unsuitable Things then, ought with
the utmost Precaution, to be guarded against,
search'd for, shunned and avoided, in our first
Thoughts about Matrimony; especially if we
have any Views of Felicity in a married State.
For here all future Unhappinesses of married
Mortals begin.</P>
<P>TAKE it Matrimonially; take it as it is a
Partnership, for Matrimony it self is but a
Partnership; though 'tis not a Partnership in
Trade, 'tis what is ten thousand times more
solemn, 'tis a Partnership in Life; a Part∣nership
of Souls, they are embarked in the same
Ship, they go the same Voyage, and, give me
leave to say, they swim, they sink, they are
happy, they are miserable, they are poor, they
are rich, just as they agree, or not agree; Love
or Hate, are united or not united; they go on
hand in hand, and have but one Fate; they rise
and fall, are blest or curs'd, nay, I believe I
might add, (with but few Exceptions) they are
saved or damned together.</P>
<P>NOR let this be censured for such an extra∣vagant
Expression as it may seem at first Sight;
for if it be a necessary Consequence of Family
<PB N="216" REF="232"/>
Disorders, that the Passions are in a general
Disorder on both Sides, by mutual Provocati∣ons.
(And how is it possible to be otherwise.)
How then can it be, but that they must Sin to∣gether,
must provoke one another to all those
Offences which naturally attend an enraged
Mind, an envenom'd Spirit, and a Soul imbit
ter'd by outrageous Usage.</P>
<P>HENCE proceed vile and provoking Words,
bitter and cutting Reproaches, undue and in∣decent
Reflections, horrid Wishes, Imprecati∣ons,
Railing and Cursing; till, in short, they
push one another on to the Gates of Hell,
and need no Devil but their own ungoverned
Rage, to thrust them in.</P>
<P>ALL this, and more, if more can be thought
of, is the Product of Inequalities in Matrimo∣ny,
unsuitable Matches, a joyning Things to∣gether
that will not, and cannot joyn; as I
said, they may be tyed together, but cannot
be joyned, joyned but cannot be united. Such
Marriages are to me little less than a Sentence
of Condemnation to a perpetual State of Mi∣sery.
The Man or Woman thus married, is
sentenced as the <HI>Romans</HI> sentenced <HI>Nero</HI> to die,
<HI>More Majorum,</HI> that was, to have his Head put
into a Collar of Iron, or kind of Pillory, and to
be scourged to Death; they are condemned to
be tyed together, and to be worry'd to Death.</P>
<P>TO marry two Persons together that are of
contrary Dispositions, unsuitable Tempers,
disproportioned Years, and the like, is like the
Way of punishing Malefactors in <HI>Persia, viz.</HI>
tying the living Body to a dead Corpse, till the
rotting Carcass poisoned the living, and then
they rotted together.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="233"/>
LET those then that esteem those Inequali∣ties
to be Trifles, and that think the hazard
nothing but what may be ventured upon; let
them, I say, rush on like the Horse into the
Battle: But let them remember 'tis with <HI>So∣lomon</HI>'s
Fool, <HI>Tanquam Boves,</HI> like an Ox to
the Slaughter, and knows not that it is for
his Life.</P>
<P>HOUSHOLD Strife is a terrestrial Hell, at
least, 'tis an Emblem of real Hell; 'tis a Life
of Torment, and without Redemption. Ma∣trimony
is an irreversible Decree; 'tis a Grave
from whence there is no return; nothing but
the King of Terrors can open the Jayl; and
'tis then but an even lay between the Man and
his Wife, who goes out first; and if when the
Jaylor comes, the Devil comes with him, 'tis
but one to one who he calls for, nay, if they
have lived the Life I speak of, as is very pro∣bable,
they may even do what they never did,
that is to say, agree for a Moment, and go to∣gether.</P>
<P>WHAT
then can the Man or Woman be said
to be doing, that ventures upon Matrimony with∣out
studiously considering and consulting the
Suitabilities that offer in the Case, without sit∣ting
down and judging sedately, at least from
what is apparent, what may probably be the
Case afterwards? If they are sensible of their
own Infirmities, let them calculate for them∣selves,
as doubtless any Man or Woman might
do, what will be their Case: As every one that
looks into his own Conscience may, if he will
be impartial to himself, make a Judgment of
his eternal State, so every one that will look
into their own Temper, and impartially compare
it with the Circumstances and Disposition of
<PB N="218" REF="234"/>
the Person they are to be married to, may make
a tolerable Judgment of what their Condition
will be after Marriage; and accordingly they
may and ought to venture, or not to ven∣ture:
A venture it is at best, because after you
have done your utmost, you may be mistaken,
may be deceived, and, after the utmost Cau∣tion,
some unsuitable Things must be expect∣ed:
You must expect Difficulties, and to have
many Things to struggle with, an Exercise for
all your Virtue, all your Self-denial, all your
Temper; as long as Flesh and Blood is a Com∣position
of Contraries and inconsistent Hu∣mours,
there will be something always left to
try your Patience, to try your Christianity,
and which, being considered, makes it the
more needful to use the utmost Precaution in
the Choice.</P>
<P>I am not going to give Directions here how
to search into these unsuitable Things, how to
judge of them, and how to distinguish Tem∣pers;
that would be a Work too voluminous
for this Place: But one general Caution may,
for ought I know, if well followed, be as good
as a hundred Sheets of Paper filled with Words
of less Signification. The Caution is short,
and easy to be understood; whether it be easy to
be put in Practice or no, that you must judge
from your selves. It is, in few Words, this:
<HI>Study well your own Temper first.</HI></P>
<P>HOW shall any Man or Woman know whe∣tlier
the Temper of the Woman or Man they
are about to marry be suitable to them, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay concur to their future Felicity, if they
do not first know their own? I remember a Gen∣tleman
of Quality and Fortune who courted
a Lady a long while, and their Fortunes and
<PB N="219" REF="235"/>
all other Circumstances agreeing, they were at
last married; while the Matrimony was de∣pending,
he happened to be talking with ano∣ther
Gentleman, who was his Intimate, and
who knew the Lady; and he was congratulat∣ing
himself, if I may be allowed such an Ex∣pression,
upon the good Prospect of his Affairs,
and the Felicity which he promised himself in
his Match; the Fortune, the Wit, the Beauty,
the good Humour of the Lady he was Court∣ing;
to all which the other Gentleman gave
the Assent of his own Opinion, from a long
Acquaintance in the Lady's Family, and with
her Person.</P>
<P>BUT, after all, says the Gentleman who
courted this Lady, there's one main Thing re∣mains
which I cannot come at, and upon which
almost all the rest depends.</P>
<P>WHAT can that be, <HI>says the other Gentleman;</HI>
I think there's nothing in the Lady but what
may make any Gentleman happy.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the first Gentleman,</HI> I cannot learn
any thing of her Temper.</P>
<P>O, says the other, she is of a very good Tem∣per.</P>
<P>AY, <HI>says the first,</HI> when she is Pleas'd, so,
they say, is somebody else; but I want to
see her Angry. Pray, did you ever see her
Angry?</P>
<P>YES, I have seen her Angry too, <HI>says his
Friend.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, and how was she then, <HI>says he.</HI> is
she a furious little Devil when she's pro∣voked?</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>says his Friend,</HI> that's according as the
Provocation is. Every Body is subject to Pro∣vocation,
and all People have Passions.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="236"/>
AY, <HI>says the courting Gentleman,</HI> but is she
not apt to be angry, soon provoked, a little Pot
soon hot.</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says his Friend,</HI> if she were, she is soon
cold again, that I can assure you, and the good
Humour returns again immediately.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>says the first,</HI> with a Sigh, pray GOD
she be not a passionate Creature, for if she is,
we shall be the unhappiest Couple that ever
came together.</P>
<P>WHY so, <HI>says his Friend.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the first Gentleman,</HI> because I know
my own Temper too.</P>
<P>YOUR own Temper, <HI>says his Friend;</HI> why,
what is your own Temper, I see nothing in
your Temper but what the Lady may be very
happy in.</P>
<P>IT may be you don't, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> but
I do; I tell you, I am a passionate fiery Dog,
and I can't help it; a Word awry, the least un∣kind
or provoking sets me all in a Flame im∣mediately,
like the Linestock to the Cannon;
I fire off as soon as I am touch'd, and make a
Devilish noise.</P>
<P>YOU jest with your self, <HI>says his Friend;</HI> but
I don't take you to be so bad as you represent
your self.</P>
<P>THAT'S because you don't know me so well
as I know my self, <HI>says the Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, well, <HI>says his Friend,</HI> if you are hot
together, you will cool together.</P>
<P>THAT'S small satisfaction to me, <HI>says the
Gentleman,</HI> because I can't promise it of my
Side.</P>
<P>BUT I'll promise you on her Side, <HI>says his
Friend,</HI> that one kind Word will cool her
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
again immediately, and then she's all Good∣ness
and Sweetness in a Moment.</P>
<P>AY, so a Word or two will cool me, <HI>says the
Gentleman.</HI> But who will yield to give the cool∣ing
Word first, there's the Difficulty.</P>
<P>WHY you must, <HI>says his Friend,</HI> 'tis your
Place; 'tis the Man's Place you know, always
to submit to his Wife.</P>
<P>I can't answer for my self, <HI>says he,</HI> I know I
am apt to be very hot.</P>
<P>AND what will you do them? <HI>says his Friend;</HI>
you should have confidered this before.</P>
<P>NAY, <HI>says he,</HI> I must venture now, 'tis too
late to go back.</P>
<P>SO, upon the whole, they did venture; and
two Pieces of Wild-fire they were; and, in a
very few Months after their Marriage, the Ef∣fects
of it appeared in a manner hardly fit to
be repeated; and all this only, because when
it was consulted and discoursed about, it was too
late to go back, so that, in a word, the Gentle∣man
had as good not have considered it at
all; for considering after 'tis done, is no consi∣derig.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, however, in the Discourse
above, that the Gentleman's Concern about the
Temper of the Lady he was going to marry,
was occasioned chiefly from a conscious Know∣ledge
of his own; and this was the Reason of
my telling his Story. For if we would make a
right Judgment of our own Disposition first, we
should the sooner see whether we should be
suitably match'd to the Person propos'd; it is
not indeed the easist thing in the World to
know the Humour and Disposition of one ano∣ther,
especially not in a Month or two, of a
courting Conversation; yet as all Judgment of
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
that kind should take its Rise from the Know∣ledge
of our own Disposition first, it becomes
every one to study well their own Temper, and
to learn to judge impartially of themselves,
which, by the Way, is not the easiest Thing in
the World to do.</P>
<P>YOU may know whether you are of a com∣plying,
yielding, abating Temper or no; whe∣ther
you can bear Provocations, and make no
return till the Heat is over, and then admonish
Calmly; or whether you are full of Resent∣ment,
Furious, apt to take Fire, and long a
quenching; whether you are Rough or Smooth,
Tender or Harsh; in a word, whether your
Temper is fit for another to bear, or able to
bear with another as unfit to be born with as
your own: From our own Tempers thus im∣partially
judged of, we might very often, I do
not say always, determine and choose for our
selves with Success.</P>
<P>BUT now, to bring this down to the Case be∣fore
me. What must we say of that Matri∣mony,
which is concluded in spite of all the
Knowledge and Discovery, either of the other
Persons Temper, or of our own? That is carried
on by Appetite, by the Gust of Inclination, by
a View of the Outside only, without consult∣ing
any thing but the Face; without inquiring
into the Qualifications, the Temper, the Hu∣mour,
the Capacities, or any of the Decora∣tions
of the Mind. What is all this but a meer
vitiated Desire, a Corruption, and, I may say,
a depravity of the Judgment, without Sense of
Virtue, or value for the Accomplishments of
the Soul; in a word, what is it but a Matri∣monial
Whoredom?</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="239"/>
AND what are the Consequences? And how
do these Consequences prove the thing? namely,
that when the corrupted Gust is satiated, when the
first Heats are over, and Souls begin to converse
together, then they begin to Repent and Repine,
they see an End of their Happiness just where
other People find the Beginning of theirs. In a
word, the Man and the Woman remains, but the
Husband and Wife are lost; the Conjunction holds,
but the Union is lost; the Marriage is fixed and
fast, but the Matrimony is gone; in a word,
there's the Whoredom without the Matrimony,
the vitious Part without the virtuous, the humid
without the sublime; there's the married Cou∣ple
without their Souls; their Affections are
no more united than the Poles, and like the
living and the dead Body I mentioned just
now, they are only Bound to one another, that
at last they may Rot together.</P>
<P>HORRID Matrimony! horrid discording
Tempers, raging Passions, outrageous Words,
hot fiery Breakings out of ill-natured, bitter
and scandalous Reflections; these sum up the
Family Conversation between them: These
form the Felicity that they have to expect:
These are the Productions of hot-headed, unsuit∣able
Wedlock; of marrying without Thought,
taking a Woman purely for a Woman, or a
Man meerly to have a Man; in a word, such
marrying is, in my Sense, no better or worse
than a Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>NOW, as I said in the Beginning of this
Chapter, the Obligations of the Marriage Co∣venant
or Vow are mutual and reciprocal; the
Band is equal, the Burthen is equally divided;
And this is it that makes the discording Tem∣pers,
the unsuitable Circumstances of which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
am now entrig upon the Particulars of, so fatal:
Marriage is a Yoke, so it is very well repre∣sented,
in which the Creatures yoked are to
draw together. If they are unequally yoked,
what is the Consequence? the Plough goes not
forward, the weak Horse draws all the Load,
and is oppress'd, and, at length, both sink to∣gether;
the Family is confused; the Affairs of
it are at a Stand; the Family-Peace is destroy∣ed;
the Interest of it neglected; and, in a
word, all goes wrong, till at last Ruin breaks
in, and both the unhappy Creatures are lost
and destroyed together.</P>
<P>THIS being the Case, the Inequalities and
Unsuitables of Matrimony are far from being
Trifles, that are to be disregarded and ventured
on, unless by such People to whom it is in∣different,
whether they live happy or no, and
that can be as happy with an unsuitable Match
as with a suitable one. I know there are such
Kinds of People in the World, whose very
Souls are indolent and asleep; who receive no
Impressions of Grief or Joy, Pain or Pleasure
and whose Minds are, as it were, perfectly pas∣sive
in Life; unconcerned in whatever happens
to them, that neither look before them or be∣hind
them, one Way or t'other, but rise in the
Morning to go to Bed at Night, rise up on pur∣pose
to sit down again, and sit down only to
rise up. These are indeed fit to marry in this
manner; they are the Family of the Easy
Ones, and to them 'tis all one to be happy or
unhappy, bless'd or unbless'd, quiet or unquiet;
Frowns are all one to them as Smiles, and bad
Words as good; they neither Taste the sour or
the sweet; the Musick of the Viol, or the
Scraping of a Kettle, is alike to them, and
<PB N="225" REF="241"/>
they distinguish not between Good and Evil.
All I can say to such, is only this, that at pre∣sent
I am not talking of them, or to them; I
am rather directing my Speech to the rational
Part of Mankind, who aim at a Happiness in
this Life, and understand what it means; who
desire to live like Men, and like Christians,
and know how to do so; and, for this very
Reason would match themselves with such,
and such only, as have the like just Notions,
and understand what a Life of Enjoyment
means, as well as themselves.</P>
<P>TO these, I say again, that all Inequalities
in a state of Marriage, are as so many Wounds
in the Body, which, if left to Nature, will
fester and inflame, and, at length mortify,
and be fatal; at best they require a great deal
of Surgery, Plaistering, and, perhaps, Open∣ing
and Incision, to cure and restore them;
but are abundantly better and easier prevented
than cured, be the Skill ever so great: In short,
all Inequalities are Diseases in, Marriage, and
all Diseases are best cured by Anticipation;
for, as the Learned say, Errors in the first Con∣coction
are not remedied in the second; but
the ill Digesture affects all the natural Opera∣tions,
till at last it reaches the Blood and
animal Spirits, and there contracts Capital Dis∣eases.</P>
<P>TO conclude: Let all those that expect Feli∣city
in the married Life, that have the least
View beyond the sensuality of the Brutes, and
look on any thing in Marriage beyond the
bridal Bed; I say, let them study to Match
with proper and equal Circumstances; with
Persons, as near as possible, suitable to them∣selves,
and that in all the Particulars, of which
<PB N="226" REF="242"/>
I shall give the detail in the next Chapter.
Whether my Advice be of Weight or not, I
refer to what follows.</P>
<P>I am told, in the very Moment of writing
this Head, that to talk of Inequalities and Un∣suitable
Things in marrying, is too general;
that 'tis an Amusement only, and gives no
light into my Meaning. A young Man mar∣ries
a Wife, his Thoughts are to be sure upon
having a suitable Bedfellow, a pleasant, agree∣able,
handsome Woman, to divert himself, and
to sport with. What do we tell him of Ine∣qualities
and Unsuitableness? he knows no∣thing
of it; I must explain my self.</P>
<P>IN obedience to the Ignorance of the Ob∣jector,
and supposing it the Sense of the Times,
I shall explain my self accordingly: And first,
I grant, that young Gentlemen now act just as
the Objection is stated; they marry, get a
Fortune and a Bedfellow, and that is all they
trouble themselves about. The Case is excel∣lently
well express'd by my Lord <HI>Rochester:</HI>
<Q><L>“With an Estate, no Wit, and a young Wife,</L>
<L>The solid Comforts of a Coxcomb's Life.”</L>
<L>Roch. Art. to Clo.</L></Q></P>
<P>I grant, I say, that this is much of the Case
before me; and this is that makes so much Ma∣trimonial
Whoredom in the World: This is the
very Essence of the Crime I am reproving, namely,
that the married People look to the <HI>Coxcomb's
Comforts,</HI> not to thereal Comforts of a married Life,
to the Enjoyments of the Night, not the Enjoy∣ments
of the Day; to what's present, not what's
to come; and while they do so, no wonder we
have such dreadful Family-Doings as we have
<PB N="227" REF="243"/>
in the World. Such Strife, such Breaches,
such Family-Wickedness! While the End for
which they marry, and that kind of vitious
Love which brought them together lasts, they
run out in their wicked Midnight Excesses one
Way; and when that Love is cool'd, the viti∣ous
Flame quenched, the Fire extinguished,
there being no solid Affection founded upon
Virtue and true Merit; they run out into their
Day-light Excesses another Way; I mean, jar∣ring,
scandalous Contention and Discord.
Thus the first Part of Life is Matrimonial
Whoredom, and the last Part Matrimonial
Madness.</P>
<P>BY all this, I think, 'tis apparent that,
next to Virtue and Religion, Suitability is the
only solid Foundation on which the Conjugal
Felicity is grounded; and unsuitable Matches
ought to be avoided with our utmost Care.
And that I may explain my self at large, and
because these unsuitable Things are too many,
and have too great Obstructions attending
them to be contained in a general Defini∣tion,
and more than at first Sight seems pro∣bable,
take them in the following Particulars,
all of them really inconsistent with the Feli∣city
of Marriage.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Unsuitable Years.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Unsuitable in Quality.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Unsuitable Estates.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Unsuitable Tempers.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Unsuitable Principles of Religion.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>OF all these I should speak distinctly, and
employ distant Chapters upon some of them; nor
would it be remote to the Design of this Work to
<PB N="228" REF="244"/>
do so upon all of them; but I study brevity; and
I am very far from having a barren Subject be∣fore
me; I have rather more Matter than can
be brought into the Compass I have prescribed
to my self; yet Things must be explained as I
go, and especially because they all tend to
make the married Life unhappy, though they
may not be all equally fatal. I'll run them over
therefore, in a summary Way, for the present,
the Persons guilty will have room enough to
enlarge in their own Reflections separately, and
as it suits their Case; for the scandalous Ine∣qualities
of such Marriages as I aim at, are too
many; no Man will say, there is a want of
Examples.</P>
<P>NOR are the Inequalities of Matching, as
they are now managed, especially by the Ladies,
of so light a Consequence, and so insignificant
as some would make them; and let but the La∣dies
reflect a little upon the melancholy Cir∣cumstances
of some of their Sex, who warm'd
thus by the secret Heats of Nature, which they
have afterwards been sensible of, they have
thrown themselves away in the scandalous man∣ner
I have mentioned, with what Self-Reproaches
have they loaded themselves, when they have
seen themselves in the Arms of Scoundrels and
Brutes, who, at other times, they would have
loathed the Thoughts of, and who they live to
abhor with as compleat an Aversion, after these
unhappy Heats are cool'd, as ever they did be∣fore.
But of this in its Place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Marrying at Unsuitable Years.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is true, that the Laws of Matrimony
have not prescribed us to Years, ex∣cept
in the Case of Infancy and Child∣hood,
and the Reasons for that are
obvious; but, as is mentioned before,
where the Laws are Silent, there the general
Rules of Reason and Religion take Place, and
are Laws to Christians and to Men of Reason,
as is the Case of our Limitations in Meats and
Drinks. We are not limited or directed to
what, when, or how much we shall eat or
drink; but all Excesses in either are sinful; and
so all scandalous and indecent Things among
Christians are sinful and unlawful; and the
Rules of Decency and Sobriety have certainly
the Force of Laws to those who profess them∣selves
Christians, as much as if they were ex∣pressly
mentioned in the Decalogue it self.</P>
<P>NOW to judge of Decency with respect to
the disparity of Years in Persons marrying, I
think we need go no farther than to bring it
down to the original Word, Modesty, of which
I took notice in the Introduction; and, I think,
this may pass for a Maxim, that what can't be
Modest is not Decent; or, if you will, trans∣pose
the Particles <HI>is</HI> and <HI>can,</HI> and read it thus:
<PB N="230" REF="246"/>
That what is not Modest cannot be Decent.
If then Christians are to do Things of good
Report, certainly Things not Decent and not
Modest, are forbidden them. How the Practice
of our modern Christians in this particular Ar∣ticle
are either Modest, Decent, or of good Re∣port,
enquire within, and you shall know far∣ther.</P>
<P>IT
is the Opinion of some, that after there
is no more room to expect Children, it is not
lawful to marry. Nor are the People who are
of this Opinion, the looser or weaker Part of
Mankind; but the serious, solid and religious,
as also Persons of Judgment and Learning, and
they ground it upon this very Text, <HI>Phil.</HI> iv.
8. <HI>of good Report;</HI> and upon comparing this
with what is expressly mentioned in the Office
of Matrimony, namely, that the principal End
of Matrimony, as an Ordinance or Institution
of GOD, is for the lawful Procreation of Chil∣dren.
Now to what End then, say they, is
Matrimony, when the Person, that is, the Wo∣man
in particular, is past Child-bearing? All
the rest can be nothing but what is not sit to
name. The Office of Matrimony indeeds adds,
that another Reason of Matrimony is to pre∣vent
Fornication, <HI>Remed. Amoris.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if the married Couple are past Chil∣dren,
one would think too, it should be time for
them to quit the other Plea; and then let them
tell us, if they can without Blushes, whether
they have any Plea for Matrimony, that does
not come within my Title, <HI>viz. Conjugal Lewd∣ness,</HI>
or Matrimonial Whoredom? There are
many scandalous Things might be said upon
this Subject, but I turn it all another Way,
and had rather mention it by Way of Question;
<PB N="231" REF="247"/>
let the Parties answer it, if they can, with∣out
Breach of Decency. I dare say they will
find it difficult; and yet there may be more
Modesty in the Answer, than there is in the
Thing it self too.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the Lady to be about Five and
fifty; and the Question is first put to her, Whe∣ther
she has any room to expect Children, or
whether she thinks it possible, in the ordinary
Usage or Course of Nature, that she should have
any Children? And this Lady marries, whether a
younger Person than her self, or not, tho' that is
ordinarily the Case; but suppose, for the present,
not a young Man, because I shall speak of that
Part by it self. Now what can be a lawful or
modest Reason for this Matrimony? or if we
should say to this Lady, <HI>Pray,</HI> Madam, <HI>why did
you marry?</HI> what could she say.</P>
<P>TO say she married in hopes of Children,
that could not be; 'tis foreclosed in the Begin∣ning
of the Question.</P>
<P>TO say she married for one to look after her
Affairs, that could not be; that's foreclosed too,
by supposing her to be in good Circumstances,
and to have her Estate all settled and firm.</P>
<P>TO say she does it to avoid Fornication, Mo∣desty,
if she is Mistress of any, will forbid her
talking in that manner.</P>
<P>SHE has, indeed, nothing to say, but to
Blush and look down; to acknowledge that she
did it to gratify (as the Poet expresses it mo∣destly)
a <HI>frailer Part;</HI> in short, she ought to
say, that she married meerly to <HI>lie with a
MAN.</HI> And is not this Matrimonial Whore∣dom?
If not, what then must it be called, and by
what Words, that will not be Criminal in them∣selves,
can we express it?</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="248"/>
SUPPOSE the Lady to have no Occasion to
better her Fortune, her Circumstances being
very good, and indeed, in such Cases they sel∣dom
better their Fortunes, but worst them.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE her to have no want of a Steward
or Manager, her Estate being a Jointure or Fee-Farm
Rent, paid her Quaterly, or Interests of
Stocks, or any other Certainty that takes those
Excuses from her.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE her to have no Occasion for ad∣vancing
her Equipages or Retinue, or her splen∣did
Way of Living; for these, and such as
these, are usually made Excuses for all those
scandalous Things, and much dirty Pains are
taken by the guilty Ladies, to cover the Action
from the just Reflections which the World casts
upon them. But when they are examined to
the Bottom, 'tis evident, that, as the Prophet
<HI>Isaiah says, the Covering is too narrow, and the
Nakedness will appear.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to come closer to the Case. Here is a
Lady of fifty or sixty Years of Age, she has
had Children in her younger Years, but has
left Bearing for ten or twenty Years, and is
past not the Probability only, but even the
Possibilty, according to Nature, of Bearing
any more. But this Woman casting her vi∣tiated
Eyes upon a young Fellow of twenty∣five
or thirty Years old, perhaps her Ser∣vant,
her Book-keeper, or her late Husband's
Steward, or some meaner Person, she presently
takes Care to let him know, that he may be ad∣mitted,
if he will push at it. The young Fel∣low
takes the Occasion, and, making his easy
Interest, she marries him.</P>
<P>IF any Man is displeased at my calling this
by the Name of Matrimonial Whoredom, let
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
him find a better Name for it, if he can, and
tell me, what I shall call it, that is suitable to
the Thing it self. If it is not lewd and scan∣dalous,
nay, open declared Lewdness, what else
must it be? what else can it be? I remember
the Excuse a certain antient Lady gave for
such a Marriage, had more Craft in it, tho' per∣haps
more Truth too, considering it Allegori∣cally,
than most of the lame Extenuations I
generally meet with.</P>
<P>DEAR Madam, says a neighbouring Gentle∣woman,
her Relation, to her, I hear your Lady∣ship
is resolved to marry; I cannot say I be∣lieved
it, for indeed I did not.</P>
<P>WHY, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> for such she
was, why should you not believe it?</P>
<P>NAY, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> because for your own
sake. I would not have it be true.</P>
<P>WHY, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> why would you
not have it be true?</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> you live so purely;
to be so easy, so happy, so free, as you are, me∣thinks
you cannot think of coming into Fet∣ters
again.</P>
<P>BUT, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> I am not so
easy as you think I am.</P>
<P>DEAR Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> what can be
more happy? why, you have nothing to trouble
you, and no Body to controul you.</P>
<P>WELL, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> no more I
won't, if I marry; for I am resolved to take a
young Man, that has his Dependence upon
me, and I am sure to preserve my Authority
with him.</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> pray GOD you
don't find your self mistaken.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="250"/>
HOW can I be mistaken, Cousin? <HI>says the
Lady;</HI> why, I take him with nothing; I shall
make a Gentleman of him.</P>
<P>AY, Madam, though you do, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI>
I have known so many underling Fellows turn
Tyrants, and domineer and insult their Bene∣factresses,
that I can never think of any thing,
but of being betrayed and ill treated, when I
hear of such Matches.</P>
<P>WHAT, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> when one raises them
from a Beggar, Cousin.</P>
<P>'TIS all one, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> when
once they get to Bed to their Mistresses, they
never know themselves after it; they know no
Benefactors.</P>
<P>WELL, I must venture it, I think; why, I
can't live thus, <HI>says the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>LIVE thus! Madam, <HI>says the Cousin;</HI> why,
don't you live as happy as a Queen?</P>
<P>ALAS, Cousin, you don't know my Case,
<HI>says the Lady;</HI> I am frighted to Death.</P>
<P>FRIGHTED, Madam, wiht what? <HI>says the
Cousin.</HI></P>
<P>I don't know what, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> 'tis the
Devil, I think; ever since Sir <HI>William</HI> died al∣most,
I have been disturbed in my Sleep, either
with Apparitions or Dreams, I know not which.
They haunt me to Death almost.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> I hope Sir
<HI>William</HI> don't Walk.</P>
<P>NO, I think not: But, I think, I see him
every now and then, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> and some∣times
another Shape; 'tis Sir <HI>William,</HI> I think,
in another Dress.</P>
<P>WHAT does he say to your Ladyship? Does
he offer to speak? <HI>says the Cousin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="251"/>
NO, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> Sir <HI>William</HI> did not, but
the other Appearance spoke to me, and frighted
me to Death: Why, he asked me, to let him
come to Bed to me; and, I thought, he offered
to open the Bed, which waked me, and I was
e'en dead with the Fright.</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> then it was but a
Dream, it seems; it was not the Devil.</P>
<P>NO, it was a Dream; but it was the Devil,
to be sure, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> for all that.</P>
<P>WELL, but Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> if it was
the Devil, what will a Husband signify?</P>
<P>WHY, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> I can't bear to be alone
in the Night, and be thus terrified.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> will a Hus∣band,
and such a one as you propose, be able
to drive the Devil away? I suppose your Wo∣man
lies with you; she is as able as he for such
a Thing; that is to say, she will be with you,
and call for help, if need be; and he can do
no more.</P>
<P>I do not know what to do, Cousin, not I,
<HI>says the Lady,</HI> but, I think, I must have him;
my Mind is so distracted I shall never be
easy.</P>
<P>NAY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> then 'tis that
makes you Dream so, it may be.</P>
<P>NO, no, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> don't have
such Thoughts on me, pray.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, her Cousin found what De∣vil
it was haunted her Ladyship; so she confessed,
at last, that the Lady had good Reasons for mar∣rying;
but then she argued warmly against her
taking the young Fellow; and after reckoning
up a great many Gentlemen in the Neighbour∣hood,
she press'd her earnestly not to marry be∣low
her self.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="252"/>
WHY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> a Gentleman
will always be a Gentleman, and will treat you
as you deserve, like a Lady, and like a Person
of Distinction; but a Scoundrel knows not how
to use a Lady well, when he has her.</P>
<P>WELL, but Cousin, who would lay you out
for me then? <HI>says the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> there's your
Neighbour, Sir <HI>Adam</HI>—</P>
<P>FIE, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> how can you
talk so? Why, he's an old Man; I'll never take
a Man older than my self.</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> when we are
young, we always say, the Man should be at
least, ten Years older than the Woman.</P>
<P>AY, then; <HI>Then</HI> was <HI>Then,</HI> but <HI>Now's Now,</HI>
Cousin. Why, sure, you don't think—.
What should I do with an old Man almost
seventy?</P>
<P>NAY, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> I don't know
what your Ladyship should take any Man, old
or young, for; I think you are perfectly happy
as you are; but if you don't like him, there's
Sir <HI>John</HI>—, he is younger than your Lady∣ship
by ten Years.</P>
<P>I wonder at you, Cousin, <HI>says the Lady;</HI>
why, he is a sickly, decaying Gentleman; he is
troubled with I know not how many Distem∣pers.</P>
<P>NO
Distemper, Madam, <HI>says the Cousin,</HI> but
the Gout.</P>
<P>WELL, the Gout, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> that's e∣nough;
I have no mind to be a Nurse, I assure
you.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, and will your Ladyship have
this young Fellow then? I profess, 'tis scanda∣lous.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="253"/>
WHY, I think I must, Cousin: He is a hand∣some,
jolly, brisk Fellow' <HI>says my Lady;</HI> I can∣not
say but I like him.</P>
<P>NAY, if you want a brisk young Fellow,
<HI>says the Cousin.</HI></P>
<P>I don't say, I want him for that. But what
would you have me take, a Skeleton?</P>
<P>THERE is a long Part of the Dialogue still
behind, in which the old Lady confess'd some
Things, in Confidence to her Cousin, which,
though extraordinary well to my Purpose, will
not so well bear reading; and therefore I omit
them. But, in a word, the Lady took this young
Fellow, and she was as Unhappy with him as
could be imagined; she settled Two hundred
Pounds a Year upon him for his Life; and, in
a word, he broke her Heart; and he lived upon
it afterward, till he anticipated the Income of
it, sold his Life in it, spent the Money, and
died in Jail; all which he richly deserved, for
he was a Brute to her, however brutal her mar∣rying
of him was.</P>
<P>NOW what was all this but Matrimonial
Whoredom? she married him for nothing more
or less but the meer Thing called a Bedfellow;
and he took her to be her Servant, to give it no
worse a Name, and to have a Settlement of
Two hundred Pounds a Year for his Pains.</P>
<P>BUT we have grosser Examples than this,
and that near our own Days, and within our
own Knowledge. A certain Lady, and of a
great Fortune too, at the Age of sixty-four,
not many Days ago, took into her Service, as I
may very justly call it, a young Clergyman of
four and twenty, a handsom, jolly Gentleman,
who might have had Wives enough, and suit∣able
<PB N="238" REF="254"/>
to himself, and such as might have made
him happy, having a tolerable Benefice, which
he lived comfortably upon.</P>
<P>BUT Avarice, and the View of enjoying seven
hundred Pounds a Year, a Coach and four, with
all the <HI>Addenda</HI> that a Man of Sense knew
well how to Comfort himself with, prevailed
with him to tye himself down to the sour Ap∣ple
Tree, and he submits to the servile Drudgery,
and marries her.</P>
<P>AND here the Consequence fell hard on the
Man's Side. First, she grew unsufferably Cove∣tous,
and so Narrow, that, keeping her Revenue
in her own Hands, she hardly allowed him Ex∣pences
for his daily Subsistence: In the next
Place, she was jealous of him to a kind of Mad∣ness
and Distraction; and, in a word, he was
forced to threaten to leave her, and turn her
off again, before he could obtain any tolerable
Usage.</P>
<P>NOW what did this Lady marry for? What
retence could she possibly make for it, but
this Matrimonial Whoredom that I speak of?
It is hardly possible to assign any other Reason,
at least, that will support it self, or that any
one can defend. She lived perfectly easy, had
her Friends about her, the Estate was in her
own hand, and she wanted no help to look after
her Rents; for it's apparent, after her Marriage,
she did it without him.</P>
<P>IN short, 'tis evident the End of that scan∣dalous
Match was visible to the World; there
could not be one modest Word said for it; at
least, that could carry any Weight in it;
and the Town have used her accordingly; for
she is the Reproach of all Company, the Scorn
and Scandal of her Sex, the Talk of all the
<PB N="239" REF="255"/>
Tea-Tables and Assemblies round about; the poor
Drudge, who she has taken into pay, is pitied
by every Body; and the Town where he lives,
it is doubted, will make a Bonfire, when she is
pleased to walk off, and congratulate him by
all the Methods suitable to the Sense of his De∣liverance.</P>
<P>WHEN
an old Man of seventy or eighty
marries a young Girl of twenty, we have ge∣nerally
some Game among the common People
about it. But here there may not be so much
room for Scandal, because it has often happen∣ed,
that Men have had Children at a very
great Age; and there may be extraordinary Rea∣sons
for them to desire Children; as particu∣larly
for the enjoying Estates, to which they
have no Heirs. But be the Reasons what they
will, the Thing is unquestioned because lawful,
and the having Children is possible; so that
the great End and Reason of Matrimony is
not destroyed.</P>
<P>BUT what shall we say when two antient
People, the Woman past Children, and the Man
also: What do these join together for? And
which of the Ends of Matrimony are to be
answered in their Conjunctions? I observe, the
World are generally reconciled to those Matches
because of the Parity of Circumstances; and
they ordinarily express themselves thus: Well,
let them marry, there's no great disproportion
in their Age; ay, ay, why should they not
marry? they are very well match'd, the Man's
almost Threescore, and the Woman is not much
less, they'll do very well together; so there's
little or no Scandal rais'd here, I mean, in the
Mouths of the common Censurers of such
Things.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="256"/>
BUT I differ from the common Opinion here
exceedingly; and I must say, that, in my Opi∣nion,
this is as much or more, a Matrimonial
Whoredom than the other. The Reason is the
same; the Occasion of Matrimony is the same,
with this difference notwithstanding, and to the
Disadvantage of the latter Case; for that, in
the first Case, the lewd Part lay wholly upon
the Woman, here it lies upon them both:
where the old Lady married the young Man,
the Matrimonial Whoredom could lye only on
her Side; but here the equality of Years makes
an equality of Guilt; there was a single Shame,
here a double; and I am much mistaken, if
two being guilty makes the Offence less than
one.</P>
<P>WHAT can two People at those Years say
for marrying, seeing they know they can have
no Children? It must be for the frailer Part,
which it is not my Business to name; and 'tis
only contrived, in a manner, less exposed to the
common Scandal of the Times; the Woman
has her wanton Ends answered, without the Re∣proach
of taking a young Fellow to Bed to her,
on the Account mentioned before, and only is
content to sleep with an older Bedfellow, to
avoid the Scandal.</P>
<P>BUT there is a worse Case in this scandalous
Matrimony yet behind, and this is on the
Man's Part; a flagrant Example of which take
as follows: <HI>A</HI>—<HI>B</HI>—, a grave Citizen,
and in the flourishing Part of his Years, though
not in his Prime, not a Youth, being about
Forty, buries his Wife; he has three or four
Children by his former Lady, and cares not to
have the Charge of any more, or, to use his
Words, would not wrong his Children, but has
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
a kind of an Occasion, which shall be nameless,
and he must marry.</P>
<P>TO answer both these Ends, and to join the
Wife and the Wicked together, he will, in the
abundance of his Prudentials, take a Wife that
shall be sure to be pass'd Children; so gratify∣ing
the Beast and the Christian both at once.
Upon this, he singles out a grave motherly Wi∣dow,
who he took to be about Five and fifty,
and indeed, by her Face, she seemed to be no
less.</P>
<P>THE Lady had as much Occasion for a Hus∣band
as Mr. <HI>B</HI>—had for a Wife; whether
it was upon the same Motive, History is silent
in that Part, and so am I; but, it seems, she
had been given to understand what Foot it was
Mr. <HI>B</HI>—married upon; and not being
willing to disappoint him, or rather, not wil∣ling
to lose him, she call'd her self an old
Woman, and her Beauty concurring, admitted
what few Widows are pleas'd to stoop to, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that she was, as above, near Five and fifty.</P>
<P>BEING thus happily married, and Mr. <HI>B</HI>—wrapt
up in his Enjoyments, lo, to his great
disappointment, the Lady proves with Child,
and, in the due Course of Time, brings him
Twins, a fine Boy and Girl; and after all this,
as I say, in the due Course of Time, three
more.</P>
<P>THIS unlook'd-for, undesired Fruitfulness,
moves him to enquire a little farther; and,
searching the Register at the Birth of his Twins,
he finds, to his surprize, that truly Fame, and
a course Countenance, had wronged his Wife
about ten Years, and that, instead of being Five
and fifty, she was not much above Four and
forty.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="258"/>
UNDER this Disappointment, his Conti∣nence
betrayed the Occasion of his Marriage;
for, as above, he had no less than five Children
by her, which, her Fortune being not extra∣ordinary,
ruined the Fortunes of his first Chil∣dren,
who he pretended to have so much Con∣cern
for. This was the End of Matrimonial
Whoring with Mr. <HI>B</HI>—. And now he is
ashamed to talk publickly of his own Shame,
as well the Reasons of his Marriage, as the Ma∣nagement
of it, in which he has indeed this
Advantage of the Satyr, that his Discoveries
are too gross to be described, as his Language is
to be repeated; so he must pass unreproved for
the Reasons given in Page 9.</P>
<P>I meet with so many of these Sorts of lewd
Marriages, that I can hardly refrain giving a
List of them, saving, that they come so near
home, and the Persons will so necessarily be
pointed out by the Descriptions, that I am loth
to draw Pictures that every Body must know.
But something must be said to shew the Vari∣ety.</P>
<P>THERE
lived an eminent City Gentleman,
if that Language may be allowed to be good in
Heraldry, not a Mile from St. <HI>Mary A</HI>—,
who having lost a good Wife, went a Fortune∣hunting
for another; but openly declared, he
must have an additional Qualification too, <HI>viz.</HI>
she must be pass'd Children.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> He had a House full of Children al∣ready,
and but a moderate Fortune; so he pre∣tended
to marry again, to better the Fortunes of
his Children.</P>
<P>AN intimate grave Friend of his, and a real
Friend to his Fame, as well as to his Family,
took the freedom to expostulate upon this Sub∣ject
<PB N="243" REF="259"/>
with him very freely, and it occasioned
the following short Discourse, according to the
old <HI>English</HI> Custom, which Foreigners laugh at
us for, and which we have little to say; for
their Salutes were <HI>Jack</HI> and <HI>Tom,</HI> though Men
in Years, and Men of Figure, one almost an
Alderman.</P>
<P>SAYS <HI>Tom,</HI> his grave Friend, to <HI>Jack,</HI> Pr'y∣thee,
<HI>Jack,</HI> what's all this I hear of you?
Why, you make all your Friends blush for
you.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blush for me! What do you mean?
I don't blush for my self, what need they blus
for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you run to every Hole and Cor∣ner,
to every Church and Meeting-house, Ball,
and Assembly, a Wife-hunting, and, as they
say, a Fortune-hunting too; that's worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's false too; I have indeed
talk'd of marrying, but not like that neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what need you talk so much of
it? There are Women enough; 'tis but Ask and
Have, Pick and Choose; the Market's on our

it. You may have a Wife any where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't find it so, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so it should seem; but how can
that be, <HI>Jack?</HI> A Man in your Circumstances
can't want a Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not such good Circumstances neither.
Han't I got a House full of Children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what then? And an't you
reckoned a Ten thousand Pound Man, an Alder∣man's
Fellow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="244" REF="260"/>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but I am, perhaps, a little too
nice in choosing too: I'm not so easily pleased,
it may be, as you imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you want another young Wife,
as pretty and as pleasant as that you lost. One
would think you should be past that, <HI>Jack.</HI>
Why, you are turn'd of Forty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only that you happen to be quite mi∣staken;
and that I look just the contrary
Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by that? Explain
your self, what is it you drive at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be plain with you, the Case
is this: Money I would have, that's the first
thing; but then I have Children enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! grown Miser already. What,
would you marry an old ugly overgrown Wi∣dow
of Seventy, only for her Money? Han't
you Money enough?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no. Look ye, <HI>Tom,</HI> I an't the
Man the World takes me for; I am well enough,
but I am far from rich; and I have seven Chil∣dren,
you know; and that's enough to make a
rich Man die poor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't Halt before you're Lame; you
are worth Ten thousand Pounds, at least; every
Body knows that; and a thriving Man too.</P>

<P>No, no, I an't so rich; but if I was,
what's that to be divided into seven Parts? And
what must the eldest Son do? Must he have
nothing more than the youngest Sister? You
know I'm a Freeman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, so you want a Wife with a For∣tune,
that her Money may go to your Children.
What old Fool must that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is the Fool I want; how∣ever,
<HI>Tom,</HI> you know I am a Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, what if she should have more Chil∣dren
of her own, <HI>Jack?</HI> What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, <HI>ware Hawk;</HI> that's my Busi∣ness?
I'll take care of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, you will have a Wife pass'd
Children then. Is that it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, that's it indeed. But I would
not have a very Old one, neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't think that's a lawful Marriage,
<HI>Jack.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so? pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, where do you read, that any of
the Ends and Reasons of Matrimony is to pick
out a Wife, only for her Money? that is not
taking a Wife, <HI>Jack,</HI> 'tis Matrimonial Plunder,
'tis robbing a Woman, only within the Pale of
the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but to tell you the Truth, <HI>Tom,</HI>
I care not a Farthing whether I have much
Money with her, or no, if I like the Wo∣man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now you speak Bravely and
Gallantly; I like that. But, hark ye, <HI>Jack,</HI>
what's come of the Story of the seven poor
Children? And where's the Father you talk'd
of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, I'm the Father still; for I
stick by the Point. I am resolved to have no
more Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you'll have the old Hag, without the
Money; nay, that's worse than all the rest.
What! an old Woman, and no Money! that's
the Devil, <HI>Jack.</HI> You won't be such a Fool,
I'm sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you talk madly. I think I may
have a Woman past Child-bearing, and not have
an old Hag, I hope.</P>

<PB N="246" REF="262"/>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee, tell me, what will please you;
and then a Body may look out for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, a good jolly handsome well-bred
Woman, about Forty-eight to Fifty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Widow, I suppose; there's no ven∣turing
upon a Maid under Fifty, not in your
Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I would have her be a Widow that
has Children, but has done Childing for seven
or eight Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And she must be Jolly and Handsome,
you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not have her Old and Ugly
too, <HI>Tom,</HI> that's too hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I believe I know what you want,
and what you mean. But, pr'ythee, <HI>Jack,</HI> be
honest; methinks you are all wrong: What
should you marry for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you why not, if you are willing
to be serious. You had a fine charming Lady,
almost twenty Years; she brought you a good
Fortune, and has left you seven fine charming
Children; your two eldest Daughters are fine
beautiful young Ladies, and Marriageable;
'twould look very hard to bring a Mother-in∣law
among them all. It will make a sad
House, <HI>Jack;</HI> it will ruin your Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. My two eldest Sons are in
Business. One I have placed out to an <HI>Italian</HI>
Merchant; and one's in my own Counting∣house:
And my two Daughters will go to their
Aunt, their Mother's Sister, who will be glad
to have them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what must the three young Ones
do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, they'll do well enough till they
grow up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, where's the Father, now? <HI>Jack.</HI>
What's come of the Father you talked of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's the Matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, take home a Mother-in-law, dis∣perse
your Family, and turn your Children out
of Doors, as they grow up; and all this for a
new Wife. Is this like a Father? <HI>Jack.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I won't turn them out of
Doors for her, neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Jest, you know better; you
must turn them out of Doors, or they'll turn
her out of Doors, that you may depend upon;
and the last would be hard too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what Necessity is there for either
of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best Answer to that, <HI>Jack,</HI> is;
what Necessity can you have to marry at
all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know; I have no Necessity in∣deed;
but I am alone, without a Wife: I want
One to guide my House, and govern the Fa∣mily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be? when you have two
young Ladies, Women grown, that are perfectly
fit for it, and shew you, that they very well
understand it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true; but they won't be
always with me; they'll marry. One of them
is bespoke already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, 'tis time enough then: And, be∣sides,
perhaps, before they are both gone, your
two youngest may be grown up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true. But 'tis not like the go∣vernment
of a Wife in a Family; there's no
Authority.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>How d'ye mean? You would not give
the Authority over your Children to a Wife;
and you must do that, or turn them out of
Doors, or, as I said above, you must give the
Children Authority over your Wife; and that
will never do; so, in short, your House will be
a <HI>Bedlam,</HI> and you will be undone: For if once
the Family-Peace is gone, the Man's undone;
that I take for granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I must venture it, I think; for
I must have a Wife to direct Things; there
must be Conversation and Confidence, and a∣bundance
of Things which a Family requires,
that make a Wife absolutely necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Cousin, <HI>Jack,</HI> don't mince the
Matter. You don't want a Wife, but you want
a <HI>Woman.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are quite out, <HI>Tom;</HI> you mistake
the Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you may call it what you
will; but you'll never make the World under∣stand
you any otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't help that; I am to understand
for my self. I don't value the World. I tell
you, that Part is not so much as in my
Head.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if it is not in your Head, 'tis
somewhere else then, I tell you; no Body can,
nor ought to take it any otherwise; 'tis a pre∣posterous
Thing; 'tis against the Laws of GOD
and <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by that? What
Law is it against? pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you force me to be serious with
you, whether I will or no. I tell you, the Mar∣riage
you propose, though it is not against the
express Letter of the Law, 'tis against the in∣tent
<PB N="249" REF="265"/>
and meaning of it; 'tis all Vice and Wick∣edness,
and, I'am sure, that is against the
meaning of all Law or Rule that a Christian
ought to walk by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me. Pray, explain your
self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the Thing explains it self: To
marry a Wife on purpose to have no Children;
Why, any Body knows the meaning of that. I am
plain, and I explain my self thus: As to marry
her, to give your Children her Money, was a
Matrimonial Plunder; so to marry her, to have
no Children at all, is a <HI>Matrimonial Lewdness;</HI>
'tis only a kind of legal Whoring, <HI>Jack,</HI> you
may call it what you will; I tell you, it's Vice,
under the Protection of the Church, as I said,
t'other was Robbery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very plain with me, that's true.
But, I tell you, there is no such Thing in my
Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, I tell you, whatever you may
persuade me to, you will never make any Man
else believe it. The Notion of directing your
House, governing your Family, Conversing,
Confidence, and such Stuff as that; all these
are Pretences, and no more; the Thing is a
<HI>Woman,</HI> a <HI>Woman,</HI> I tell you, and nothing
else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you will make it be so whe∣ther
I will or no, I can't help that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then take a Wife in the ordinary
Way of suitable Years, like a Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, and fill the House again with
a new Family? No, that won't do at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you won't marry like a Chri∣stian,
then live unmarried like a Christian.
Pr'ythee be a Christian one Way or t'other.
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
But to marry, and yet resolve to make it
impossible to have Children; there's nothing
of the Christian in that; any more than you
may call your self a Christian, and live like a
Heathen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jack.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very severe, <HI>Tom;</HI> very rigid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love plain Dealing; I am for your
doing honestly, either one Way or t'other. If
you are in a streight for a Woman, take one in
the Name of GOD, and in the Way which GOD
has appointed. But to pretend a thousand
Things, and then marry with Views contrary,
and inconsistent with the Ordinance it self,
that's all Grimace; the visible Occasion is
Lewdness; scandalous Lewdness, and you can∣not
carry it off, let your Pretences be what they
will.</P>
<P>THIS Discourse ended soon after this. But
the Citizen was not so convinced of the Justice
of his Friend's Reasoning, as to guide him to
the wiser Medium, and not to marry at all:
But, on the contrary, he pursued the brutal
Part, took the Woman, gratified his grosser
Appetite, in spite of Argument. In a word,
he committed the Matrimonial Abomination I
am so justly exposing. And he felt the Conse∣quences
of it many Ways: As, (1.) He destroy∣ed
his Constitution, ruin'd his Health. (2.)
He was Blasted, as it were, from Heaven; for
he got a Woman of an unquiet furious Temper,
that harass'd him with her Tongue, made a
<HI>Bedlam</HI> of his House, and broke the Peace of his
Family. (3.) Endeavouring to oblige One that
knew not how to be obliged, he disobliged all
his 'Children; provedan unkind Father, and that
dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e them from him, some one Way, some
<PB N="251" REF="267"/>
another; and, in a word, he ruined the whole
Comfort of his Life; and such is the Fruit of
Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>TO conclude. This is frequently the Occasion
of great Mischiefs in Families where it happens;
it creates constant Feuds, and, above all things,
Jealousy, indeed it has a direct tendency to
it; 'tis as natural for an old Man to be jealous
of a young Wife, and an old Woman to be
jealous of a young Husband, as it is for People
to be afraid of Fire or Thieves, where there is
no Body left at home to look after the House.
Nor are such People at all beholden to the
World's Good-will. Nothing is more frequent
than for the People, by their common Dis∣course,
Flouts, Jeers, and Gibing, to promote
those Jealousies, and (if the married Couple have
no more Wit) to raise and encrease them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">of marrying with Inequality of Blood.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>NEQUALITY <HI>of Blood:</HI> This is an
Article in Matrimony which they,
who would be thought to expect
any Felicity in a married Life,
ought very carefully to avoid, espe∣cially
if it relates to Families also. How scan∣dalously
have I known a Lady treated in a
Family, though her Fortune has been the very
raising, or at least, restoring the Circumstances
of the Person who has taken her, only be∣cause
she has been beneath them in Degree?
That she has not been of noble Blood, or of
what they call an antient Family; that she has
not been what they call a Gentlewoman, and
yet they have not found any Defect either in
her Education or Behaviour? How has she been
scorned by the Relations, and the Title been
hardly granted her, which the Lord of Necessity
gives her? And all because of what they call Me∣chanick
Original. Again, Sir <HI>G</HI>—<HI>W</HI>—has
married a Lady out of a noble Family. Sir <HI>G</HI>—is
Master of a vast Fortune, has about seven thou∣sand
Pounds a Year Estate, and Cash enough in
ready Money to purchase as much more. But,
alas! he is of no Family; his Father was a
Citizen, and purchashed a Coat of Arms with his
Money, but hardly can tell who his Grandfather
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
was; and the Lady is taught to despise him at
that rate, that it is hardly reconcileable to her
Sense, that she should ever entertain him in the
Quality of a Husband. It is true, that she
had but a mean Fortune, <HI>viz.</HI> five thousand
Pounds. What then? she had much rather
have married a <HI>Scotch</HI> Nobleman, as she could
have done, the Earl of—, though he had
not above a thousand Pounds a Year. But then
she had had a Man of Quality, and she had had
a Coronet upon her Coach; she had match'd
like her self, and mingled with noble Blood, as
she ought to have done. But now she is De∣based
and Dishonoured, she is levelled with the
Canail; the old Countess, her Lady-Mother,
considered nothing but the Money; and d—it,
she had rather have been King <HI>Ch—</HI>'s
Whore, and then she might have been a Duchess,
and her Children had been Dukes of course,
and had had noble Blood in their Veins by the
lowest degree, and royal Blood on the other
Side; whereas now, in short, she looks upon
her self to be little better than Prostituted, and
that meerly for an Estate.</P>
<P>WITH this Elevation of Pride, concerning
Blood and Family, she treats her Husband with
the utmost Disdain: She will have her Equi∣page
by her self; she will not so much as give
his Liveries, but the Livery of her own Family;
she won't have his Coat of Arms painted upon
her Coach, or engraven upon her Plate; much
less will she suffer her Coat of Arms to be
quartered with his, if she could help it, on any
Occasion; and 'tis a great Mortification to her
that her eldest Son, attach'd to his Father, and
honouring his Person, learns not to copy
after her; and is not ashamed of the Blood of
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
his Paternal Line, by whom he inherits so fair
an Estate.</P>
<P>MY Lady carries on her Resentment so far,
that she won't visit her Husband's Sister, tho'
she has married an Earl, because she disdains to
rank below her; and as to all the rest of Sir
<HI>G</HI>—'s Relations, they are looked upon as
not worth making a Bow to them, other than
she would do to a Country Farmer, that comes
to her Ladyship to pay his Rent.</P>
<P>AMONG her Intimates, she laments her Mis∣fortune
that she should be so dishonoured in
her Match; wonders at her self, how she sub∣mitted
to let such a Fellow come to Bed to her,
and is horridly provoked that she has had any
Children; for the present she has parted Beds
with him a great while; so long, that she thanks
GOD she has forgot him in that relation; she
made a Political Quarrel with him three Years
before, and she swore to him, he should have no
more to do with her that Way, she would as
soon lie with her Coachman; and she has kept
her Vow most sacred: And was it not for some
Conveniences of her Way of Living, Equi∣pages,
the Mansion House, which is new and
fine, and cost fifty thousand Pounds building,
and the like, she would feign another Quarrel,
and step out of his House too, and then she
should be my Lord—'s Daughter again,
not my Lady—, the Wife of a City Knight,
which is much at one to her, as if she had been
Mrs.—, the Shop-keeper's Wife at <HI>Win∣chester,</HI>
or Mrs. Any-Body; or especially it had
been much more honourable to the Family, to
have been <HI>Lady Mayoress;</HI> then, at least, she
had been Quality for a Year; and her good
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
Man had been once <HI>a Lord,</HI> though his Father
had been <HI>the Lord knows who.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN she talks to his Servants, that is to
say, those that are his Servants too, she taunts
them with such an Air of Haughtiness, as if
they were Dogs, not Servants; while she treats
her own Servants with a difference, as if they
were as much superior to his, as she thinks she
is to their Master.</P>
<P>THE honest Gentleman her Husband, is a
Man of Sense and Breeding, and particularly
of abundance of Good-humour: He thought
at first he should have been very happy in a
Wife, and he chose her for what he thought she
had, (but she had it not) namely, good Tem∣per,
Sense and Sincerity. He could have bet∣tered
his Fortune in a Wife, by thirty or forty
thousand Pounds, whenever he had pleased;
so that he neither married her for her Family,
or her Fortune. Tho' he was not a Lord, he
was able to buy a Lord when he pleased; and
as much despised a Title, unless it had been by
Blood, or obtained by special Merit, as she a∣dored
it, only for the meer Equipage of it. His
disappointment in her Temper was a great Af∣fliction
to him; and he did not fail to expostu∣late
it with her, tho' with the utmost Civility.
But Pride had gotten the ascendant so much
over her Temper, that she was resolved to ruin
her Family-Peace, as it were, in meer revenge,
for her false Step, as she called it, in marrying
beneath her Quality; tho' she really revenged
it only upon her self.</P>
<P>AGAIN; her Pride was attended with such
unhappy Circumstances, that it exposed her
very much, and made her the common Jest of
all the Families of Gentry, and even Nobility
<PB N="256" REF="272"/>
also, of which there are a great many in the
Country where she lives: As I have said, that
Sir <HI>G</HI>—was a well-bred Gentleman, and a
Man of Sense, he was acceptable to every
Body; kept the best Company, and was very
well received in all Places; nor, however the
Lady acted, did the Nobility, even of the first
Rank, think it below them, both to Converse
with him, and even to Visit him; which re∣lished
so ill with her Ladyship, that she could
hardly refrain her little Sarcasms, even before
them; reflecting on Persons of Quality keeping
Company below themselves, as she call'd it,
and of the antient Nobility debasing their
Blood, by mingling with Mechanicks; that
their Ancestors scorned to intermarry with the
Commonalty, and kept the Honour of their
Families entire and untainted.</P>
<P>SHE was roundly answered once, at her own
Table, by a certain noble Lord of an antient
Family, who told her.</P>
<P>MADAM, <HI>says he,</HI> your Ladyship very much
mistakes the Case. In former Days, the Nobi∣lity
possess'd great Estates, and had powerful
Dependencies; the Landed Interest was theirs,
and almost all the Possession was their own;
the Commons held under them either in Vas∣salage
or Villainage, either as Vassals, Tenants,
Cottagers, or Servants; and then it was in∣deed
beneath a Man of Quality to match a∣mong
the Vassals.</P>
<P>BUT then two Things are to be observed,
which have happened in <HI>England</HI> since that
Time.</P>
<P>1. THE Commons have grown rich by In∣dustry
and Commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="273"/>
2. THE Nobility are become poor, or at
least poorer; be it by Sloth and Luxury, I do
not determine.</P>
<P>THE Consequence is this, that the Nobility
sell their Estates, and the Commons buy them:
And so the Landed Interest is separated; and
the Commons possess, I believe, ten Parts of
twelve, hardly leaving the other two Parts of
twelve to the better guided Nobility.</P>
<P>THEN, Madam, of these whom we still call
the Commons, great Numbers of them are of
noble Families; for the Gentry bringing their
Sons up to Industry and Trade, they have found
the Sweets of Commerce in such a manner,
that they have raised innumerable Families
out of nothing; by which means it now is
come to pass, that many of our best Gentry are
embarked in Trade; and there are some as
good Families among the Tradesmen, as most,
out of that Class; we often go into the City to
get Fortunes for our Sons; and many noble
Families, sunk by the Folly and Luxury of
their Predecessors, are restored, by marrying
into the Families of those that you call Me∣chanicks;
and, Madam, (added his Lordship)
the Children of those Families, thus raised by
their Merit, are not easily distinguished from
some of the best Houses in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>HERE his Lordship thought he had pleased
the Lady, because she had three Sons, very fine
young Gentlemen, by Sir <HI>G</HI>—. But, far
from being pleased with his Discourse, she
could not forbear being almost rude to his
Lordship, and told him, she thought the No∣bility
could not Match so among the Com∣mons,
without corrupting their Blood; and that
those that had done so ought to be no more e∣steemed
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
Gentlemen, or to rank among the an∣tient
Families.</P>
<P>HIS Lordship smiled. Well, Madam, says
his Lordship, then you must let the Tradesmen
keep their Money too, as well as keep their
Daughters; and we shall continue to decline
and become poor, by our riotous and extrava∣gant
Living; and so, in a few Ages more, the
Wealth of the Nation may be almost all in
the Hands of the trading Part of the People;
and the decayed Nobility may be as Despicable
as they may be Poor. Pray, <HI>added he,</HI> what would
all our noble Blood do for us without our Estates?
And pray, Madam, says he, be pleased to look
into Things, and see how many noble Families
are, at this time, the Offspring of Trade;
we do not find, that their Posterity are less va∣lued
among the Nobility, or less deserve it.
Two Dukes, adds his Lordship, are, at this
time, the Grandsons, and one Nobleman, the
Son of Sir <HI>Josiah Child,</HI> who was but a Trades∣man;
and the noble Families of <HI>Excester,</HI> of
<HI>Onslow,</HI> of <HI>Ar</HI>—, of many more, are married
to the Daughters of Tradesmen; and, on the
other hand, the Sons of Sir <HI>James Bateman,</HI> Sir
<HI>Thomas Scawen,</HI> and several others, are married
to the Daughters of our Nobility.</P>
<P>HIS Lordship was going on; but she begg'd
him to say no more of that, fearing he would
have brought it down to her self at last; and
so the Discourse went off. But the Lady was
handsomely reproved.</P>
<P>THESE are some of the Fruits of unequal
Marriages, and in which much of this Matri∣monial
Whoredom may be committed; and I
call it so, because the submitting to lie with a
Man, only on the Account of a Settlement or
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
Fortune; at the same time despising, and, in
the vilest manner, contemning the Man; is a
meer selling the Person for a Slave, or, though
the Words are something harsh, prostituting the
Person for the sake of the Money. And what
is that more or less, according to my Notion,
than Matrimonial Whoredom?</P>
<P>The next Article is that of <HI>Unsuitable Estates.</HI>
This is of the same Kind with the last, and, in
its Degree, is equally destructive; and there∣fore
I join them together in the same Chapter;
the only Difference is, that the first respects a
Person of Quality marrying a Mechanick, a
Patrician, or one of the Blood of the <HI>Patricii,</HI>
marrying a <HI>Plebeian:</HI> But this latter looks a
Stage lower, and respects only the Difference
of Estates, where the Blood may be the same;
which Difference, however, is carried on by
some to greater Resentments than among the
Nobility. This happens frequently among
Tradesmen, and is distinguished by many
People, very much to their Disadvantage. Sir
<HI>M</HI>—<HI>G</HI>—was a City Baronet, that is, the
Son of a Money Baronet; he married a Lady,
the Daughter of a rich Citizen, not in the
Bloom of her Youth, far from Beautiful; but
then he had a vast Fortune with her; all this
was well of his Side. But, what is she? Why,
in the first Place, bringing her to a level with
himself, she has a great deal of Money, that
is true, and he has little or Nothing; he has
a great deal of good Manners, and good Hu∣mour,
she very little of either; he is Hand∣some,
she next Door to Frightful: She insults
him upon the Inequality of her Fortune. What
does he say to her in return? Has he nothing
to answer on his Side? Truly, no, not at first.
<PB N="260" REF="276"/>
But being a Man of Breeding, as I said above,
he took it quietly, and was easy; gave her all
manner of Liberties, made no reply, gave her
not one ill Word; till, at length, being pro∣voked
beyond all possible Degrees of human
Patience, he resolved to make her a terrible
Return; and, indeed, he was sorely provoked,
that he was. He first begg'd of her to be easy
and quiet, and to use him better, and manage
her self better. She provoked him so much
with her vile Reproaches and Reflections, up∣on
his being a Beggar, as she call'd it, and mak∣ing
a Figure with her Money, that one Day it
broke out into a Flame that could not be
quenched. But it was his particular good For∣tune
to have several of her own Friends to be
Witnesses of the Provocation, and so far to
justify him, as, at least, to witness in his Be∣half,
that her Language was unsufferable.</P>
<P>NOR is it to be wondered at, that when he
did break out, he did it with such a Fury that
conquered all her Resistance, and that put a full
check to her Clamour; for it touch'd her in the
most sensible Part, namely, her Character as to
Modesty.</P>
<P>HE gave her this, even the very first time,
in a full broad Side, as the Sailors call it, and
when, as I say, her own Relations were present.
But he did not do it, till she had long and
very often provoked him, by reproaching him
with her Fortune, and his want of a Fortune,
and that with so much Bitterness, that even
some of those Relations of her's begg'd her to
forbear, and have done with it; and he, per∣ceiving
that Relation inclined to speak, with∣drew,
to give her an Opportunity, which she
improved, and earnestly entreated her to for∣bear;
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
told her, it was now too late to reflect
upon those Things; that they had Money e∣nough
to make them both happy; and that, let
it be whose it would before, it was a Stock in
common now, and she should never make their
Lives unhappy now about the foolish Question,
who brought it? She told her, she might easily
see her Husband was exceedingly moved with
what she had said already; and that she would
certainly provoke him by such outrageous U∣sage,
to make her some bitter return; that she
ought to consider she was a Wife, and that it
is always in a Husband's Power to make a
Woman's Life uneasy to her, especially when
he has Justice on his Side.</P>
<P>SHE was so far from being prevailed upon
by this calm and cool Reasoning, that she flew
out into a Passion against her Husband, though
he was not in the Room; reviled him over and
over with his living gay upon her Fortune,
while he was but a Beggar himself, and the like;
so that the poor Lady, who had talked so calm∣ly
to her, had not room to put in a Word.</P>
<P>IN the highth of this Feud the Husband
came in again, and calmly desired her to have
done, and be quiet, and, at least, to talk no
more of it then, when she seemed to be in a
Passion. But 'twas all one; she run on till, in
a word, she was out of Breath, and began to
have done, meerly for want of Strength, not
Rage. To proceed:</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, says he, now, I hope, 'tis
my turn to speak a little; then, turning his
Speech to the Lady that had spoken in his Ab∣sence,
and to her other Relations, he gave them
a brief Account how long she had treated him
in this Manner; how little Occasion he had
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
given her for it; and with what Patience he
had born it: How just it was for him to say,
that he could bear it no longer, and that he
was resolved to use her as she deserved. Then,
turning to his Wise, who still upbraided him with
marrying her for her Money: He said, 'tis very
true, Madam, I did so; and who the Devil would
have married you for any thing else? He
added, that if she would find any One to take
his Bargain off of his Hands, he would return
all the Money again, to be rid of her: And if
she could not, since she had taken him, and he
was unhappily bound to stand to the Agreement,
he insisted, she should act the Part of a Wise,
not of a Termagant; of a Gentlewoman, not
a <HI>Billinsgate;</HI> and that, since she had taken
him, let her Fortune be what it will, he ex∣pected
to be used as well, as if he had taken her
upon an equal Foot, otherwise he is sold to
her for a Slave, which he did not understand to
be in the Contract.</P>
<P>SHE revil'd him upon this, with his taking her
Money with design to Abuse her; he reproaches
her with giving him her Money and her Person
too, upon a worse Occasion; he tells her, he
could have lived without her Money better
than she could live without a Man; that he
only hired himself out to her to be her Ser∣vant,
(he called it by a harder Name) and that
he had earned all her Money by lying with
her, which a Porter would hardly have done
cheaper.</P>
<P>IT is true, this was Bitter: But there were
two Misfortunes, on her Side, attending it.</P>
<P>1. THAT she extorted it from him. And,</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="279"/>
2. THAT it was true; both these joined to
excuse the Knight, who otherwise, and as I
said, till by long and unsufferable Taunts and
ill Usage, he was put a little out of himself,
was a Person of all possible Temper and Man∣ners.</P>
<P>THIS also brings it home to my Point,
namely, that these lewd ill-principled Matches
are often as Miserable as they are Scandalous,
as Unhappy as they are Unseemly; and as
they begin in Wickedness, they end in Weak∣ness;
for Crime and Shame follow one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>I shall, perhaps, be asked here, What this
Unsuitable and Unequal marrying relates to
my Title, and to the Subject I am upon, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
of Matrimonial Whoredom? And why I ram∣ble
from my Text? But I shall make it out,
that I am not gone from my Subject at all; be∣cause
almost all those Inequalities and Unsuit∣able
Things, which I complain of as the Bane
of Matrimony, are generally the Consequences
of those Marriages, which are guided by the
Tail rather than the Head; forced on by the In∣clination
rather than the Understanding,
pushed by the Impetuosity of the corrupt Part,
not guided by the steddy Results of Reason;
the Fruit of Desire not Judgment, and with a
View to sensual Pleasure, not solid Enjoy∣ments.</P>
<P>THESE are the great Moving-Wheels in the
Machines of rash and unguided Love; the
Passion of Love, not the Quality, is the Weight
that makes them move; it is the Fuel of Love,
not the Flame; the Flame would be pure,
were the Materials that feed it pure: But
<PB N="264" REF="280"/>
when the Combustibles are nauseous, the Burn∣ing
scatters noxiou Vapours; like the Stink-Pots,
which the <HI>Turks</HI> used to throw into Ships
when they Boarded them, which would poison
the poor Men out of their close Quarters, and
make them run out, though they were sure to
be killed.</P>
<P>SECRET, lewd and ungoverned Desres,
make these open and scandalous Doings so fre∣quent;
were it all done in a criminal Way, I
should take notice of it in Lump, as a Breach
of the Laws of GOD and Man; and, as the
Text speaks, <HI>an Iniquity to be punished by the
Judge,</HI> Job xxii. 28. But it is quite otherwise
here; the Fire is covered, the Stench is con∣cealed,
and we have all the criminal filthy
Part acted under the disguise of Virtue, and
the Protection of Law. This is the Offence,
this is the Grievance complained of; and this
the Reason why I give it the new and perhaps,
a little shocking Title of Matrimonial Whore∣dom.</P>
<P>THE
meaning is plain; 'tis a Breach of Law
under the Protection of the Law; 'tis a Crime,
thro' the Policy of Hell, plac'd out of the reach of
Justice; 'tis a Sin against the meaning of Ma∣trimony,
but within the Letter of it; 'tis a
Wickedness couch'd under the Name of Virtue;
'tis, in short, a Devil in Masquerade, whoring
in the Vizor of Matrimony; a Sinner dress'd up
for a Saint, a foul Disease under the Term of a
Decay; 'tis Idolatry under the Cover of true
Worship, and, as I said above, Lewdness under
the Protection of the Church.</P>
<P>WHAT Excuse can it be to say, that the Law
cannot reach it? Are there not many Sins which
the Commands of GOD prohibits and forbids,
<PB N="265" REF="281"/>
which, notwithstanding no Law can punish?
And are they less Criminal for that, or the
more? The Laws of the Land punish no Man
for Avarice, yet Covetousness is expressly for∣bid
in the Scripture; and the Love of Money
is called the Root of all Evil. The Laws of
the Land take no notice of our Anger, Passion,
Fighting, Gluttony, Excess of Drink, and se∣veral
other Things, except Murther, Breach of
the Peace, Drunkenness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the Conse∣quences.
You may eat till you gorge your
Stomach, and destroy your Life; you may SIP,
and WHET, and doze Nature, till it expires in
a Lethargick Sotisme; you may Rage, Storm,
and make your House a Hell, and the Law
takes no Cognisance of you. But no Man will
say, they are not all detestable and abhorred
Crimes for all this; unbecoming a Man of
Sense, and inconsistent with a Man of Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>THUS,
in the Case before us, the Law is si∣lent,
and the Sinner safe, provided you do but
marry. Let the Foundation of it be what it
will, let the Reason of it be all as gross and
corrupt as Hell; the Motive all Sulphur and
Salt, the Views as vitious and filthy as Words
can express; that's all to be answered for some∣where
else, and you take it upon your selves,
so you do but marry; the Law, like <HI>Gallio,</HI> the
Deputy of <HI>Achaia, cares for none of these
Things,</HI> Acts xviii. 17.</P>
<P>BUT, are they the less Criminal? Is the
lewd Part less offensive? Is the Soul less cor∣rupted?
Is the Man less debauched? Not at all;
but rather the more: Nay, the Devil, I make
no question, as he has infinitely more Advan∣tage
to prompt, fails not to make use of the
<PB N="266" REF="282"/>
Advantage, for he's no Fool: I'll answer for
<HI>Satan</HI> so far, he can hardly be ever charg'd with
missing his Opportunities, or not seeing his
Times and Seasons; he never fails to break in
at every weak Place, and always knows where
those weak Places are.</P>
<P>WE cannot doubt but the Devil, if you will
grant there is such a Thing, takes all the Advan∣tage
that can be of this Part; he shews the Law
protecting; and persuades you, that 'tis therefore
justifying the Fact, a Fallacy as black as himself;
he prompts the vitious Appetite, and then
shews you how 'tis lawful to gratify it; he
quotes <HI>Dryden</HI> upon you, and shews the Case
of King <HI>David,</HI> and the Polygamists, for a
Parallel.</P>
<P>What can be sore specious, what more easily
gilded over? Inclination calls for it, and the
Law allows it. Under this Pretence, all the
criminal Things which the Marriage-Bed is
capable of, are justified.</P>
<P>BUT was the true intent and meaning of
the Laws of GOD or Man impartially judged
of, or enquired into, the Case would be quite
otherwise. GOD, <HI>forbid,</HI> we should dare to
say, that the Institution of Matrimony, which
was Pure, as the Institutor was Holy, could be
designed for a Pandor to our impure and corrupt
Inclinations! or that GOD's holy Ordinance can
be made a Plea for any of our unholy and vi∣tious
Practices; and, above all, that they should
be made a Cover and Protection for them.</P>
<P>ALL the Heats and Fires, rais'd within us by
the Acrimony of the Blood, by the Inflamation
of the Spirits and Animal Salts, are kindled
from Hell, set on Fire by the Devil, and made
to rage and boil up in the Veins, by the in∣flaming
<PB N="267" REF="283"/>
vitiated Thoughts and Imagination,
that Imagination which GOD himself says is
Evil, and only Evil, and that continually;
and whatever the Just and serious Reasonings are
which we should use upon this, and the Conse∣quences
we should draw; surely they are not that
we should apply our selves to quench this Fire
in the Lakes of <HI>Sodom,</HI> (I do not mean literally
as to <HI>Sodom</HI>) that we should study Ways to
satiate and gratify those impure Desires; and
then finding some artful Method, give a loose
to our Appetite under the Cover of a legal
Protection, sheltering our Wickedness under the
Letter of the Law.</P>
<P>ON the other hand; if I was to enter into
the Affirmative or Positive Part, and tell you
what you ought to do, I should say, these are
the Deeds of the Body, which you should mor∣tify,
if you will expect to live, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 4.
the <HI>Thorns in the Flesh,</HI> which you should pray
against, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 7. the Enemies you should
struggle with; and this is what the Scripture
means, when it speaks of our <HI>crucifying the
Flesh, with its Affections and Lusts,</HI> Gal. v. 24.
But I must not Preach. To talk Scripture to
a Man when he has a Woman in his Head, is
talking Gospel to a Kettle Drum; the Noise is
too great; the Clamour of his Vices is too
loud; and he will answer coldly, as the Wise
Men of <HI>Athens</HI> answered St. <HI>Paul, We will hear
thee again of this Matter,</HI> Acts xxvii. 32. or to
put it into a kind of a Paraphrase; We will
hear thee again, some time or other, when we
have nothing else to do.</P>
<P>I come therefore to search the Crime, and
fully to expose it. Your own Reason, and, if
you have any, your Religion, will instruct you
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
to reform it. These unsuitable Matches are
generally derived from these corrupt and de∣praved
Principles; and these vile Appetites are
the Things that carry us on to break into all
Rules, Religious and Moral, in the pursuit of
Women.</P>
<P>WHEN the Appetite governs the Man, he
breaks all the Fences, and leaps over all the
Bars that Reason and Religion have fixed in
his Way; and if he can but justify himself, by
pretence of keeping within the Bounds of the
Law, tho' it be only the Letter of it, he trou∣bles
not himself with the intent and meaning
of it.</P>
<P>HENCE all the Matrimonial Inequalities,
the marrying at unsuitable Years, with unsuit∣able
Fortunes, and all the indecent and ridi∣culous,
not incestuous, Matches, which we see
daily among us; so that to speak of unsuitable
Matches, is far from being out of the Way of
my Business, or remote from my Subject; they
are, generally speaking, from the same impure
and corrupt Originals, impure Streams, from
the same poisoned and corrupted Fountain.</P>
<P>THE Man is eager, urged by the Importu∣nities
of his vitiated Appetite; his Head is full
of it; he runs from Place to Place to find an
Object. To say his Eyes are blinded with the
Fumes and Vapours of his fermented Blood, is
to speak according to Nature, it cannot be
otherwise; as we say Love is blind, and sees
no Faults, so 'tis undoubted, the Passion is blind,
the Rage of the Appetite blinds the Eyes, and
he is not capable of seeing even the Defects of
Nature, much less to distinguish the unsuitable∣ness
of Objects, and the inequalities of Cir∣cumstances;
he is still farther off from seeing
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
the Defects of the Mind, the Unsuitableness
of the superiour Parts; 'tis all out of his
Way.</P>
<P>AS 'tis in the more vitious Part Men often
abandon handsome and beautiful Ladies, their
lawful Wives, and take up with the foulest,
ugliest, and most disagreeable Creatures, to
make their Whores; so in this Humour of
marrying, meerly to quench Desire, the Vapour
darkens the Eyes, the Vice clouds the Sight,
the Man or Woman takes what Offers, making
no Judgment, no Distinction of worthy or
unworthy, suitable or unsuitable, young or
old; 'tis the Sexes that are only concerned;
'tis the Fire that is to be quench'd; neither
Reason, Religion or Reputation, are hardly
allowed to give a Vote in the Case, nay, some∣times
common Sense: And, in this Heat, I say,
most of the unequal unsuitable Marriages are
made; and, what is it all? what can it be
called? Is this Matrimony! Is this being join'd
together according to GOD'S holy Ordinance,
or is it Whoring under the Mask of the holy
Ordinance! Is this a chaste and honourable
Marriage! Is this the <HI>Bed undesiled,</HI> or is it ra∣ther
a meer Matrimonial Whoredom!</P>
<P>I might include in this same Chapter, the
unsuitable Tempers which often come toge∣ther
on such Occasion; but as it is true, that
this is a thing not always to be avoided, and is
what too frequently happens in Marriages made
with the utmost Consideration; so I shall con∣vince
the Reader that I am careful not to run
from the Subject in hand, by passing it over
as a thing out of my Way at present. It is not
always possible fully to discover the Tempers
and Dispositions of one another before Marri∣age;
<PB N="270" REF="286"/>
and they that make the fairest and most
diligent Inquiry, should first be sure they
know, and regulate their own Tempers, that
the Fault be not at home while they lay it
upon their Relatives. But this would require a
long Discourse; I have not room for it
here.</P>
<P>UNSUITABLE Principles in Religion would
also come in here. But, I think, the People
I am describing need not quarrel much about
that; for all Principles, all Religion, seems to
be burnt up in the impure Flame, and there∣fore
all Care and Concern about them dies with
it: How should that Man be supposed to think
of Religion, who, in spight of Reasoning, and
in a perfect neglect of a Family of seven
Children, could plead Necessity of having a
Wife; make a thousand Shifts to turn off the
scandalous Part, and yet insist upon having
such a Wife as should bring him no Children;
that he might satiate his Gust of Sensuality
without the incumbrance of Procreation; con∣tract
Marriage with a Bar only to the original
Reason of Marriage, and enjoy his corrupt
Pleasures under the disguise of GOD'S holy Or∣dinance.
Could this Man be supposed to consi∣der
the Unsuitableness or Inequality of any
thing, much less the Temper or the Principles
of the Woman he married.</P>
<P>AND the Consequence made it appear; for
happening to marry a Woman that had neither
good Temper, or good Principles, he ruined the
Peace of his Family, dispersed and disobliged
his Children, thrust them out of his immediate
Care, and left their Education and Instruction
to other Relations; in a word, he robb'd him∣self
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
of the Comfort of his Children, and his
Children of the Comfort of a Father.</P>
<P>AND where was the Religion of all this?
In short, what of Matrimony was in it all?
what was it but, as I said before, a poisoned
Stream from a corrupted Fountain, a dishonest
Flame quenched in a dishonest Manner? And
it can be no otherwise, where the Soul is go∣verned
by the Body, where the spiritual Part
is over-ruled by the fleshly, where the sensual
directs the rational, as is the Case here ex∣actly;
I say, it can be no otherwise. The
Order of Things is inverted; Nature is set
with her Bottom upward; Heaven is out of
the Mind, and Hell seems to have taken Pos∣session.</P>
<L>Nature inverted; the Infernal Fires</L>
<L>Burn inward, raging in corrupt Desires:</L>
<L>Such as the sulph'rous Lake from whence they came,</L>
<L>Alike the Fuel, and alike the Flame.</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of going to Bed under solemn Promises of
MARRIAGE, and although those Pro∣mises
are after-wards performed; and of
the Scandal of a Man's making a Whore
of his own Wife.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have dwelt upon the Inequalities
of Matrimony the longer, because
of their Variety. I come now to
single Cases again, and I shall
dispatch them in single Sections
as I go. I have now before me a
very particular Case, in which Marriage is
made a healing or protection to a scandalous
Crime. Promise of Marriage is Marriage in
the Abstract, say our Advocates for Lewd∣ness;
and therefore for the Parties to lie toge∣ther
is no Sin, provided they sincerely intend
to marry afterwards, and faithfully perform
it.</P>
<P>THIS is, in short, a scandalous Defence of
a scandalous Offence; 'tis the weakest Way of
arguing that any Point of such Moment was
ever supported by. It is so far from covering
the Offence against GOD, that it does not re∣compence
the Personal Injury done to Man. I
<PB N="273" REF="289"/>
have hinted at it already in the Chapter;
and given you there the Opinion of the best
of Men, and particularly the Censure of the
Protestant Churches upon it, in which, as I
said, they are more strict, and punish with
more Severity, than in Cases of simple Forni∣cation.</P>
<P>IT may be true, that Promise of Marriage
is Marriage, but it is not marrying; it may be
called Marriage, or rather a Species of Mar∣riage;
and therefore our Law will oblige such
Persons to marry afterwards as well in Cases
where they have not consummated the Agree∣ment,
as where they have; and will give Da∣mages,
and that very considerable, in propor∣tion
to the Circumstances of the Parties, where
these Promises are broken; especially where
the Person makes the Breach, by marrying
another purely in Contravention of those
Promises. And this is all the Remedy the in∣jured
Person can obtain.</P>
<P>ALSO such a Promise, especially if made
before Witness, will be, and frequently is ad∣mitted
as a lawful Obstacle or Impediment,
why a Person under such an Obligation should
not be allowed to marry any other; nay far∣ther,
the Person claiming by Virtue of such a
Promise, may forbid <HI>the Bans,</HI> as we call it; or
may stand forth, and shew it as a Cause, even
at the very Book, why the two Persons coming
to the Book may not be lawfully joined toge∣ther;
and the Minister cannot proceed, if such
a Cause is declared, till the Matter is decided
before the proper Judges of such Cases.</P>
<P>BUT all this does not reach the Case pro∣pos'd
at all; for were Promises of Marriage thus
allowed, and lying together upon such Promises
<PB N="274" REF="290"/>
lawful, you would have no more Occasion of a
fair and formal Espousal, and we should have
very little open Marrying among us. And
what Confusion would this make in the
World? How would the sacred Obligations of
Marriage be enforced, Claim of Inheritances
secur'd, Legitimacy of Children clear'd up, and
Obligation of Maintenance be preserv'd? How
and where would these Promises be recorded,
when denied and revoked? How would they
be brought into Evidence, and the Offender
against them be convicted? In a word, what
Confusion would such loose coming together
make in Families, and in Successions, in divi∣ding
the Patrimonies and Effects of Intestate
Parents; and on many other Occasions.</P>
<P>OUR Laws have therefore carefully provided,
that Marriages should not be esteemed fair and
legal, if not performed in a fair and open Man∣ner,
by a Person legally qualified to perform
the Ceremony, and appointed to it by Office;
and the Government is always concerned and
careful to punish any Defect, in the Peform∣ance
even of those qualified Persons, when
they connive at any Breach upon the Institution
in the Office of Matrimony; such as marrying
People clandestinely, in improper Places, at un∣seasonable
Times, and without the apparent
Consent of Parties; and though the Law is
very tender with respect to making such Mar∣riages
void, yet they are much the more severe
in fixing a Punishment upon the Person that
officiates, in order, if possible, to prevent all
clandestine and unlawful Matches.</P>
<P>THE Law then requiring an open and formal
coming together, as a just Recognition and Ex∣ecution
of all previous and private Engage∣ments,
<PB N="275" REF="291"/>
and refusing to legitimate those En∣gagements,
however solemn, and however at∣tested,
so as to admit them to pass for a real
and legal Marriage; at the same time forbid∣ding
all Consummation of such Agreements, till
the open and appointed Form of Marriage,
settled by the Legislature, is submitted to, and
mutually persormed. All coming together of
the Man and Woman, upon the Foot of such
private Engagements, Promises or Contracts, is
thereby declared unlawful, and is certainly sinful;
'tis no Marriage; the Children are Bastards; the
Man and Woman are guilty of Fornication;
the Woman, let her Quality be what it will,
is no better or other than a W—, and the
Man a—; <HI>what you please to call him.</HI></P>
<P>BUT now, notwithstanding all this, we have
an Excuse ready, which is, it seems, growing
Popular; at least, it is calculated for abate∣ment
of the Censure, and alleviating the Crime
or the Guilt, and consequently it is calculated
to legitimate the Practice also; that is to say;
they allow it is not strictly legal; 'tis not a full
Compliance with the Laws of the Land, and
therefore they comply with that Part, and
marry afterwards.</P>
<P>IT may be supposed, the Advocates for this
Practice have ranged over all the Protestant or
even Christian Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> to find out
some Allowance for this Wickedness in the
Practice of any other Country; and I have
traced them in the Enquiry, and can testify,
that they have but one little Corner of <HI>Europe</HI>
to fix it in, and that is, our little diminutive
would-be-Kingdom, called, <HI>The Isle of Man.</HI>
And here Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> tells us, it is a Custom,
or rather was a Custom, that if a Woman be
<PB N="276" REF="292"/>
with Child, and the proper Father of the Child
marries the Woman within two Years after its
Birth, the Child shall be legitimate.</P>
<P>NOW supposing this to be so; 'tis to be ob∣served,</P>
<P>1. THAT this was nothing but a Custom, in
favour of the poor innocent Child, whose Hard∣ship
was great, in suffering the Reproach of a
Crime it was no Way concern'd in.</P>
<P>2. THAT this was only a Custom in that
barbarous Corner, and before the People there
had received the Christian Religion, or were ci∣vilized
under a regular Government.</P>
<P>3. THAT it is not allowed so at this time,
since the Christian Religion is received, and
have been reformed, no not in that Country.</P>
<P>THE Advocates for it are therefore beaten
from all their Defences; and they can find the
Practice no where justified, no where continued.
All they have left for it now is, that they will
not have it be Criminal in the Sight of Hea∣ven,
no Breach upon Conscience; in a word,
no Sin; And if this can be obtained, the Prac∣tice
has but one Obstruction more to remove,
in order to make it general, and that is, the
risque the Woman runs, from the Weakness of
the Obligation of Honour, and from the Men's
making light of the Promise, after they have
obtained the favour on her Side.</P>
<P>HENCE it seems the strongest tye upon
Modern Virtue, is the regard to Safety; and
the Women pay a greater Homage to that Se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rity
than to the Duty; to their Interest than
to their Virtue; to their Alimony than to their
Conscience; and to their Prosperity than to
<PB N="277" REF="293"/>
their Posterity. Let us state this Case a little
clearer than it seems to stand in your present
View, and see if we can bring the World to
have a right Notion of it; for at present, I
think, the generality of Mankind are greatly
mistaken about it.</P>
<P>1. THE Obligation we are all under to the
Laws of GOD, is a Foundation-Principle, every
Christian must allow it; and that we ought not
to commit any Crime against Heaven, that is,
not to do any thing which he has forbidden.
He that denies Principles is not to be disputed
with; and therefore I lay this down as a Fun∣damental,
a Maxim, which, without begging
the Question, I may take for granted, while I
live among Christians, and am talking to such.</P>
<P>2. THE Obligation we are under to the
Laws of the Country, under whose Government
and Protection we live, is a rational Deduction
from, and is commanded by the Laws of GOD,
<HI>viz. to be subject to the higher Powers,</HI> and in all
Things lawful to submit to Governours.</P>
<P>3. THE Obligation we are under to our own
Character, and the regard to Reputation, are
undisputed; and we ought to do <HI>what is of good
Report,</HI> seeing a good Name is better than
Life.</P>
<P>ALL these three establish the Rules of Mar∣riage
to be not only lawfully imposed, but abso∣lutely
necessary; and that they ought to be ex∣actly
complied with: And all of them make it
Criminal for any Persons, that is to say, Man and
Woman, to lie togethor before; they are legally
married.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="294"/>
HAVING laid this down as settled and
slated Preliminary; it then follows, that no
pre-existing Engagement or Promise between
the Man and Woman, no, nor any subsequent
Performance of the Promise, can be substituted
in the room of Marriage, or make the coming
together (which is so, as above, forbidden) be
lawful or justifiable.</P>
<P>NOR can any subsequent Performance, I say,
take off the Crime or Scandal of what is past.
It is true, a subsequent Marriage makes it
lawful for them to come together afterward, be∣cause
it is not indeed unlawful for such to
marry. It is not unlawsul for a Man to make
his Whore his Wife, however foolish; but it is
unlawful for any Man to make his Wife his
Whore, however seemingly and intentionally
Honest.</P>
<P>BUT the Promise, say they, makes the Wo∣man
his Wife. I grant it does so indeed, in
Point of Right, but the Form alone gives the
legal Possesestion. Signing a Writing, and depc∣siting
an Earnest, or part of the Money, gives
a Man a Right to the Estate he has thus pur∣chased,
and he may fairly be said to have bought
the Estate; but he must have the Deeds fairly
executed, sign'd, seal'd and delivered, and Livery
and Seisin given in Form, before he can reccive
the Rents, and before he can take Possession of
the Land, or the Tenants own him for their
Landlord.</P>
<P>UNDER the old <HI>Jewish</HI> Institution, which, it
must be allowed, was critically just in every
Part, being instituted immediately from Hea∣ven,
a Woman betrothed or espoused to a Man,
was called his Wife, yet he never <HI>knew her</HI> till
<PB N="279" REF="295"/>
she was openly and lawfully married; that is,
till he took her in Form.</P>
<P>THE Virgin. <HI>Mary</HI> was espoused to <HI>Joseph,</HI>
but she was not married, or, as the Word is,
there used, he had not <HI>taken her to him;</HI> yet she
is called his Wife, and he is called her Husband,
<HI>Matth.</HI> i. 15. his Mother <HI>Mary</HI> was <HI>espoused</HI>—But
<HI>before they came together—she was found
with Child</HI>—in the next Verse <HI>Joseph</HI> is call'd
her Husband, ver. 19. <HI>Joseph her Husband be∣ing
a just Man</HI>—</P>
<P>AGAIN, ver. 20. <HI>The Angel of the</HI> LORD
<HI>appeared</HI> to Joseph <HI>in a Dream, saying, Fear not
to take unto thee</HI> Mary <HI>thy Wife:</HI> And again,
ver. 24. <HI>He did as the Angel of the</HI> LORD <HI>had
bidden him, and took unto him his Wife.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the Espousal made the Woman a
Wife. But they were not allowed to come to∣gether,
until the publick Ceremony of <HI>taking
her to him;</HI> which publick Ceremonies also are
to be seen at large in the <HI>Rites and Ceremonies of
the Jewish Church. Vid.</HI> Dr. <HI>Godwin.</HI></P>
<P>IN like manner, a Man and a Woman en∣gaged
by Promise, are Man and Wife, <HI>in foro
Conscienti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> but they are not legally Man and
Wife, till they are legally and publickly mar∣ried
in due Form, as the Law requires.</P>
<P>ALL this Preliminary is made needful by the
wicked Pretence of being Man and Wife, as
they call it, in the Sight of GOD, which is a
Mistake: They really are not Man and Wife
in the Sight of GOD, any other than as e∣spoused;
so indeed they are and cannot be law∣fully
separated, much less joined to any other
Person, but they are not effectual Man and
Wife in the Sight of GOD, till they are so also
in the Sight of Man; till the Publick Marriage,
<PB N="280" REF="296"/>
<HI>which is a Part of the Ordinance it self,</HI> is per∣formed,
whereby the Espousals are recognized,
and the Law satisfied.</P>
<P>AND what is this Promise they generally
speak of in such Cases? Is it not expressly so
made, and do they not call it, <HI>a Promise of Mar∣riage?</HI>
Is not the Woman's Excuse or Plea de∣livered
always in those very Words, <HI>He pro∣mised
to marry me;</HI> at least these are the Pro∣mises
we mean, and that I am now speaking
of. As to those wicked Promises between two,
so to take one another, and to live as Man and
Wife without the Ceremony, it may be called
an Agreement, but it is not a Promise of Mar∣riage,
and so does not relate to our present Dis∣course.</P>
<P>BUT
now, to bring it down to the Case in
hand. Suppose here are two young People, a
Man and Woman, they treat of Marriage, the
Woman agrees, and the Man solemnly pro∣mises
to marry her: But, in the mean time,
the Fellow (Hell prompting, and his own
Wickedness tempting) presses this Woman to
let him lie with her. His Arguments are smooth
and subtle; <HI>Why should you refuse?</HI> says he: <HI>We
are fairly Man and Wife already</HI> by Agreement,
(and, in the Sight of GOD, the Intention is the
same thing as the Action) <HI>there is nothing more
to be done</HI> but <HI>just a few Words of the Parson, and
the formality of repeating it in the Church, and
that we will do too as soon as I can get the Licence
down,</HI> (suppose it to be in the Country) or as
soon as the Asking in the Church is over; and
you may take my Word, for I assure you again,
<HI>I will be very honest to you,</HI> (and then perhaps he
swears to it) and <HI>How can you refuse me? And
then be kisses her,</HI> and continues urging and
<PB N="281" REF="297"/>
teazing her, and wheadling her to it, and perhaps
she as much inclined to it as he, only moro
for waiting till Marriage than he; so that the
Devil takes hold of Inclination on both Sides,
to bring about the Wickedness.</P>
<P>UPON these Pressings and Importunings, at
last he prevails, and she complies. And what
is this to be called? The Woman will not allow
her self to be a <HI>Whore,</HI> no, by no means: Tho
Man declares 'tis no Whoredom, he scorns the
Thoughts of it; he abhors it. He promised to
marry her, and he performed it, and they were
married afterwards. He did lie with her indeed,
and she was with Child first. But what then?
they were married before the Child was born;
so that the Child was born in Wedlock; so
that there's no harm done in all that.</P>
<P>BUT all this is wrong; 'tis all vile and abo∣minable:
'Tis not only Whoring, but 'tis worse
than Whoring, or, if you please, the worst
kind of Whoring, and that many Ways.</P>
<P>1. ON the Man's Part; here is a publick Con∣fession,
that you had a wicked filthy ungo∣vernable
Inclination, that could not contain
your self from a Woman for a few Days, but
must gratify your Appetite at the expence of
Modesty, Honesty, Justice to your Wife, Justice
to your own Reputation, Justice to the Child
to be born, and besides all, a Breach of the
Laws both of GOD and Man. How scandalous
a Piece of Conduct is it? How Brutish, unlike
a Man, and unlike a Christian? And all this
under a Circumstance so easily complied with,
under an apparent A greement for Marriage, and
even while the Preparations are making perhaps
on both Sides.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="298"/>
2. ON the Woman's Part; to say nothing of
the vitious and Beastly Part, and her want of
Modesty, in respect only to her Sex; yet be∣sides
all that, here is a Testimony of most egre∣gious
Folly; a perfect neglect of her own Vir∣tue,
and of her Reputation: A bandoning the first
to gratify the Man, and risquing the last on
a bare verbal Promise, which it is not only
possible he may break, and probable he will
break, but highly improbable that he should
not; nay, according to the Custom of Men,
according to the profess'd Notion, and the com∣mon
Language of the Town, she ought never
to expect the performance of such a Promise.
He's a Rogue, say they, that gets a Woman
with Child before Marriage; and he's a Fool
that marries her afterwards: He's a Knave
that promises to marry her; but he's a Fool
that performs it.</P>
<P>3. TO return to the Man's Part. How absurd
a Thing is it to make a Whore of his own Wife;
to expose her for a Whore, who he proposes to
embrace as an honest Woman ever after; to
draw her in to be exposed, to be flouted at, to
be jested with, and insulted all her Days, to be
the scorn of her Neighbours, slighted and
shunned by modest Women, and laughed at by
every Body; and all this to gratify a present
Gust of vitious Desire, which, in a few Days,
would be satisfied without the hazard of Repu∣tation,
without Reproach, and without Re∣proof?
How ridiculous does it make the Man,
and how ashamed is he afterwards to think of
it, even as long as he lives? And it may be,
that very Child born, the Product of this <HI>Matri∣monial
Whoredom,</HI> shall live to upbraid his own
<PB N="283" REF="299"/>
Father with it, or perhaps do the same, and
justify it by his Father's Example.</P>
<P>4. AGAIN, to speak of it as to the Woman's
Part. How rash, how inconsiderate? To expose
her self to the Reproach of being <HI>a Whore,</HI>
whereas, in a few Days, she might have gratify'd
both her self, and her Husband too, without any
Scandal to her Character. Now she exposes her
self, not only to the Reproach of all her Neigh∣bours,
but to the Contempt of the Virtuous, and to
the Jest of the Mob; and, which is more than all
the rest, 'tis ten to one but her Husband him∣self
comes to upbraid her with it, and, perhaps,
hate her for it; at least he will be always telling
her, how honest he was to perform such a Pro∣mise,
which no Body but himself would have
made good, and no Body but a Fool, that is to
say, no Body but her, would have trusted to;
and indeed, though 'tis ungenerous and unjust
in him to treat her in that Manner, yet 'tis
what she has a great deal of Reason to expect,
and what she really deserves by her Con∣duct.</P>
<P><HI>R</HI>—<HI>H</HI>—, is a North Country Laird,
which is a Title there not beneath a Man of
Quality; the Lady had, it seems, made a Slip
in his favour before Marriage, of what kind you
may guess: However, he healed up the sore,
and married her afterwards; so his Character,
as an honest Man, was saved also. But how
far'd it with the Lady?</P>
<P>IN the first Place, as he carried it but very in∣differently
to her as to Kindness, so he never failed
to upbraid her with his extraordinary Honesty in
taking her; how just he was, and how infinitely
obliged she ought to think she was to him;
<PB N="284" REF="300"/>
that it was what no Body but he would have
done: And if he took any thing ill from her,
though it was twenty Years after, he would not
fail to tell her, she was <HI>Ingrate;</HI> that she ow'd
him a Debt she could never pay; and so run
back the whole Story upon her; and how, if he
had not been honester than she was, he had
never taken her, and then she had been un∣done.</P>
<P>2. TO make the poor Lady compleatly un∣happy,
he is Jealous of her to the last degree,
and treats her very hardly on that Account;
and when she expostulates with him upon that
Head, and appeals to him for her Conduct ever
since Marriage, which has indeed been blame∣less,
the Brute runs it all back to the first and
only false Step of her Life, and, with a flout
upon all her Integrity and exactness of Living,
tells her, with an old <HI>Scots</HI> Ballad at the End
of it:
<Q><L>Titty, Tatty, Kitty, Katty,</L>
<L>False to ea Man, false to au Men.</L></Q>
It seems, 'tis a proverbial Saying for a Man
who has married a Whore, intimating, that as
she was a Whore to him, so she would be a Whore
to any Body else, or to every Man.</P>
<P>THUS she is all her Life subject to the Re∣proach;
not forty Years Wedlock, and an un∣blameable
Life, will make it up; the Debt is
never paid, and yet always a paying; and all
this for a shameful yielding her self up a
few Days before the Form would have sanctified
the Action.</P>
<P>NOR is it sufficient to plead, no not to
himself, that he importuned her, or surprized
<PB N="285" REF="301"/>
her, or drew her in; those Things are all for∣got;
or, if remember'd, amount to no Excuse.
The Breach in the Woman's Virtue being once
made, he must be a Man of uncommon Temper,
and of a great deal of good Humour, that does
not one time or other throw it in her Face, and
load her with the Reproach of it.</P>
<P>IN the next Place, the hazard on the Wo∣man's
Part is unequal, extremely unequal; for
she runs the hazard of Mortality. Suppose the
Man would be just to her, and marry her; but
then, as I once knew to be the Case, suppose
he falls sick and dies; the Woman is undone,
she is left with Child; she cannot claim the
Man, nor the Child inherit from him as a Fa∣ther;
she has not only no right to any Thing
he has left, but, for want of a Power to make
such a Claim, she discovers that she is not a
legal Wife, but was his Whore; and this in
spight of ten thousand Promises of Marriage;
ay, though there were ten thousand Witnesses
of those Promises. So certain is it, that no
Promises of Matrimony make a Marriage, and
that a Woman cannot expose her self with
greater Disadvantage, than to take Matrimony
upon trust; that all the Assurance that it is pos∣sible
for a Man to give her, cannot be an equi∣valent
to the sacrifice of her Virtue, besides
the risque of Mortality, <HI>as above,</HI> in which Case
she is inevitably ruin'd.</P>
<P>AND after all, what Pretence is there for
the thing, since Matrimony is the Matter treated
of? Why is not the Treaty finished? and if the
Treaty is finished, why in such haste for the
Consummation? or why the Consummation
without the Ceremony, or before it? Horrid un∣restrained
Appetite! Why must the brutal Part
<PB N="286" REF="302"/>
be gratified at the Woman's Expence, and that
at an Expence so very great, that nothing can
make amends for it?</P>
<P>I knew a Disaster happen on the very
same Case as this, when Mortality interpos'd;
Death snatch'd away the Man, in the very
critical Moment.</P>
<P>THE Case was thus: A young Man courted
a neighbouring Maid; the Girl had a very
good Character, was not a Servant, liv'd with
her Mother, and liv'd tolerably well; but his
Circumstances were the better of the two; so
that it was thought to be a very good Match
for her.</P>
<P>THEIR Marriage was agreed on; and the
young Woman, at his Request, took a
Lodging in the Town where he liv'd; several
Things for a time prevented their marrying,
and particularly the want of a Licence; but
he being, after some time, obliged to go to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
on some particular Occasion, he promis'd
his Mistress to bring a Licence down with
him to marry her.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in this Interval it unhappily ap∣peared
that he had prevailed with her to let
him Lie with her, and the Girl proved with
Child. He was so just to her, that when he
came back from <HI>London,</HI> where he had staid
some time, he brought the Licence with him,
and twice they went together to a neighbour∣ing
Minister to be married; but still one Thing
or other intervened; as once they came too
late, the Canonical Hour being past, the scru∣pulous
Gentleman refusted, and would not; and
the next time the Minister was really very
ill, and could not, but appointed them to come
the next <HI>Thursday,</HI> that being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> and
<PB N="287" REF="303"/>
he would not fail, GOD willing, to marry
them.</P>
<P>ON the Evening of the <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the
young Man was taken sick, which proved to
be the Small-Pox, and, in a few Days, he died.
He declared upon his Death-bed, that she was,
as he called it, his betrothed Wife; own'd the
Child to be his, obliged his Mother to take
Care of the young Woman, and of the Child,
which was as much as Providence allowed him
time to do.</P>
<P>BUT this took Wind; the young Woman
was known to be with Child, and known to be
unmarried; and some maliciously informed the
Parish Officers of it, and they the Justices of
the Peace, on pretence of securing the Parish.
But the young Man's Mother answered pre∣sently
to the satisfaction of the Parish; and
the Minister testify'd for both the young Man
and the young Woman also, that they were
twice with him to be married; so that the ho∣nesty
of Intention was on both Sides apparent;
yet the young Woman was exposed by it to the
last degree.</P>
<P>WHAT Folly, as well as Wickedness, was
here? A young well-meaning Woman prevail'd
with, on the weak Pretence of being essentially
though not formally married; I say, prevail'd
with, to gratify the Man at the hazard, and,
as it proved, at the cost or price of her Virtue
and of her Reputation; forced to acknowledge
her self a Whore, and to bring a Bastard
into the World; when, upon only waiting
a few Days, all the Scandal, all the Re∣proach,
and, which is more, the Crime also
had been avoided.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="304"/>
HERE was Whoredom under the Protection,
or in the Colour and Disguise of Matrimony!
He told her, they were married in the Sight of
Heaven; he called her his Wife, and 'twas too
evident he us'd her as such; and Heaven, in
Justice, brought her to Shame for it. What
was this but a Matrimonial Whoredom? and
that of a fatal Kind; a Kind that has so
many weak and vile Pretences for it, but yet
so fair and specious, that many (till then)
innocent Women, have been imposed upon by
them, and ruined.</P>
<P>BUT that which is still unaccountable in it, is,
that the Hazard is so great, and the Benefit,
the Gratification, or what other ugly thing
we may call it, is so very small: 'Tis like a
Man and Woman on Horseback, venturing to
ford, or rather swim, a deep and rapid River,
when the Ferry-boat is just ready on the other
Side, and may be called to them in a few Mi∣nutes,
to carry them over safe. There is no
common Sense, no rational Argument, in their
favour. But the Brutal Part prevails; the
Woman, abused with fine Promises, prosti∣tutes
her Honour, her Virtue, her Religion,
and her Posterity, on the lightest and most
scandalous Pretences that can be imagined; and
when she has done, has nothing to say but old
<HI>Eve</HI>'s Plea, <HI>The Serpent beguiled me.</HI></P>
<P>I know nothing that can be said for the
Man; nothing but what is too vile for me to
mention, too gross for my Pen; and, as I said
in another Place, the Crime must go without
its just Censure, only because it is too gross
to be named. The Motives to it are so wicked,
the Pretences for it so foul, and there is so
little to be said in Defence of it, that, in short,
<PB N="289" REF="305"/>
the best Thing I can add, is to say, 'tis the
worst Piece of Matrimonial Wickedness that
can be practised; I call it Matrimonial, because
committed under the Shelter of that sacred Cover∣ing;
the holy Ordinance is made the disguise
for it, the Woman is beguiled, under the Masque,
and on the Pretence of its being no Crime.</P>
<P>THE Man is the Deceiver; he acts the De∣vil's
Part every Way, he is the Tempter, and
is a Party to the Crime: As for himself, his
Reason must be subjected, or he could never
submit to so sordid an Action; he must be
degenerated into something below a Man; his
Appetite must be all brutal and raging, per∣fectly
out of the government of his Under∣standing;
in a word, he must be out of him∣self;
the thing is so contrary to Reason, that
it is indeed contrary to Nature, and to common
Sense, for a Man to defile his own Bed, corrupt
his own Race, make a Whore of his own Wife;
nothing can be more inconsistent with Nature,
and, as I say, with common Sense; not to say
a Word about Religion, or the Laws of GOD;
These, to the People I am speaking of, are not
to be mentioned, or, in the least, supposed to
have been thought of.</P>
<P>WHAT must the Man or the Woman think
of themselves, when, after Marriage, they
come to reflect upon this Part? What Re∣proaches
will they cast upon one another?
What Comfort, as the Scripture says, can they
have <HI>in those Things whereof they are now a∣shamed?</HI>
Granting for once what, however,
very seldom happens, that they do not come to
Reproach one another, and Revile one ano∣ther;
suppose the Man good-humour'd enough
not to abuse his Wife for her easy complying,
<PB N="290" REF="306"/>
or to be jealous of her doing the same for
others, according to the <HI>Scots</HI> Song mentioned
above: On the other hand, suppose the Wo∣man
does not upbraid the Man with delud∣ing
her, making a thousand scurrilous Re∣flections
upon him, for drawing her in by his
fair Promises, his horrid Oaths and solemn
Protestations, and now to upbraid her with
yielding. Suppose, I say, the Man and the
Woman both, not so ill-humour'd as to Re∣proach
one another with the Crime; yet they
will deeply Reproach themselves, for laying
themselves so open to publick Scandal, for
the satisfying a meer Gust, and the prevailing
Importunities of their corrupted Appetite, when
so small a Time of forbearance would have
made all safe on both Sides.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, let the Self-Reproaches
on either Side be ever so severe; let the Repen∣tance
be as sincere and as publick as you please
to imagine it, the Fact is the same; and I can∣not
call the Thing it self any thing more or
less than, according to my Title, a Matrimonial
Whoredom, and that in the coursest Degree.</P>
<P>PERHAPS some may think my Censure too
hard on the other Side; I mean, as to the
Man's marrying the Woman afterwards; and
that while I exclaim so loudly against the Of∣fence
of lying together, though under sacred
Promises of Matrimony, I encourage the Men
to break those Promises, pretending, that the Of∣fence
being already so great, they can be no
worse; for since it does not lessen the Crime, say
they, what should they marry the Woman for? If
she must be counted a Whore all her Days, and he
a Criminal, though he is so honest as to marry
her, what signifies the Honesty? He can be
<PB N="291" REF="307"/>
no worse if he lets it alone? And thus
my Reproof, they say, will do more hurt than
good.</P>
<P>TO this I answer: Let the Woman then pro∣vide
against that; for I shall never think Pity
due to any Woman after this, who, being thus
warn'd, will let a Man lie with her up∣on
Promises of After-Marriage; there can
be no wrong done to the Woman, seeing she
may avoid the Danger by avoiding the
Crime; and yet the Man is greatly mistaken
too, who pretends, that to break his Engage∣ment
with the Woman does not encrease the
Offence. If this were true, and that by per∣forming
the Promise the Person was not the less
Criminal, the Offender would always take
care not to perform the Obligation; and so
we should have a continual Complaint. But,
I say, let it be so; nay, let the Woman take
it for granted, <HI>I am sure she ought to do so,</HI>
that whenever she yields on such Terms, she
will be left in the lurch, and exposed; and this,
if any thing, would shut the Door against her complying.</P>
<P>NAY, I must needs say, the common U∣sage
is so much against her, that one would
wonder any Woman should be so weak
to yield upon those Conditions; and, to
me, it argues necessarily one of these two
Things.</P>
<P>1. GREAT neglect of the Consequences of
Things; great Indifference not only as to her
being with Child or not with Child, taken or
refused, married or not married; and so also
with respect to her Fame and Character, whe∣ther
Honest or a Whore. But,</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="308"/>
2. IT argues likewise a perfect Indifference
as to the Crime; and as to its being an Offence,
against GOD or Man; and such a Woman ought
not to be supposed to value the Sin of be∣ing
a Whore, any more than the Scandal of
it.</P>
<P>INDEED; to be utterly thoughtless of the
Consequence, and every Way as wicked as the
Man, seems to be just the Character of the Wo∣man
in this particular Case: And I must leave it
upon her, that she who thus complies, declares her
self, by the very Fact, to be utterly uncon∣cerned
about her Character, whether as a Wo∣man
of Virtue, or as a Christian; and if ever
she is brought to her Senses again, she must
be convinced, that she deserves to be so un∣derstood.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">OF A HUSBAND KNOWING HIS WIFE AFTER CON∣CEPTION,
OR AFTER SHE IS KNOWN TO BE
WITH CHILD. OF THE REASONABLENESS AND
OF THE LAWFULNESS OF IT. AND WHETHER
THIS MAY NOT COME UNDER THE JUST DENO∣MINATION
OF MATRIMONIAL WHORE∣DOM.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the Procreation of Children is the
only, or at least the chief Reason of
Matrimony; so when the Woman
has once conceived, it is the Opinion
of the learned and modest World,
her Husband ought to <HI>know her no more</HI> till she
has brought forth, and is delivered of her Bur∣then.</P>
<P>SOME will have this be called a rigid Law;
that there is nothing in the Laws of GOD to
direct such a Restraint, and that therefore 'tis
what the Text calls binding <HI>heavy Burthens;</HI>
like the <HI>Pharisees</HI> imposing Severities on others,
which they would not be bound by themselves;
and, as the same Text hints, would not <HI>touch
them with one of their Fingers,</HI> that is to say,
would not observe, or be under the Obligation of
<PB N="294" REF="310"/>
those Laws which they preached up the Necessity
and Duty of to the People.</P>
<P>THE Question before me, at present, is not
who does, or does not obey and observe the Rules
of Modesty, which we lay open to be their
Duty; but whether those Rules are just, and
such as ought to be observed, yea or no? If
they who dictate Laws do not obey the same
Laws, be that double Guilt to themselves, and
be theirs the Repentance; the Debt is no less a
Debt for its not being paid, but 'tis doubly a
Debt upon those that instruct others to pay
it. However, that's a Subject to be entered upon
by it self, our present Business is to speak of
the Thing as it lies before us.</P>
<P>THE Article I have now mentioned, is not
so much a Rule of Decency, as it is a Law
of Nature; the Obligation to it, is therefore
back'd with a superior Authority: It is not
founded in Custom and Habit; it is not the
Effect of the Curse, or brought in as Modesty is,
as the Fruit of the Fall. Shame and Blushing
may be the Consequence of Sin; but the Sea∣sons,
and the Laws of Generation, are the Off∣spring
of Nature; the great Parent of Life is
the director and guide of Life, and has ap∣pointed
the Laws of it as a general Head of
Constitutions, by which all the Creatures are
directed, and generally speaking, all the
Creatures are willingly, because naturally sa∣tisfied
with those Constitutions, and freely∣obey
them.</P>
<P>THE Brutes obey the Laws of Nature; 'tis
not a submission, not a subjection, but a meer
Consequence of their Life; and 'tis the man∣ner
in which their natural Powers are di∣rected;
'tis the Channel in which they flow;
<PB N="295" REF="311"/>
they know their Seasons, and they follow as
Nature leads; chaste and reserved when the
Streams of Nature abate, hot and furious when
the Animal Spirits return; in a word, they
come when Nature calls, and not before.</P>
<P>BUT Man! ungoverned Man! neither in∣fluenced
by the Laws of GOD, or of Nature,
gives himself a loose to his corrupted Desires,
and subjects Nature, Reason, and even Reli∣gion
it self, to his Appetite; in short, to a cor∣rupted
and depraved Appetite, a furious out∣rageous
Gust; his Will governs his Understand∣ing,
and his Vice governs his Will; the brutal
Part tyrannizes over the Man, and his Reason
is over-ruled by his Sense.</P>
<P>IT is observed of the Deer, that whereas it
is a mild, quiet, gentle Creature; tame, even
by its own Disposition, pleasant and inoffen∣sive,
and this through almost all the Seasons
of the Year; yet, in its Season, that is what
they call its Rutting-time, they are the most
furious of all Creatures; and though they do
not, like the ravenous and voracous Kinds,
such as the Lyon or Bear, fall upon other
Creatures for their Food, and to satisfy their
Hunger, which, as is observed, is a Reason
for their being so dangerous: Yet, on the other
hand, the Stag, or the Buck, at that particular
time, flies upon Man or Beast, and will kill
and trample under its Feet whatever comes
near him, or, at least, offers to come near its
Female.</P>
<P>NO Park-Keepers, Rangers of Forests, or
others, how bold and daring, or however fami∣liar
among them, will dare to come near them
in their Rutting-time, unless very well armed
and attended; that is, with Dogs and Guns;
<PB N="296" REF="312"/>
even the Dogs themselves, though they are
their Terror at another time, except it be the
whole Pack together, will not meddle with
them if they can help it.</P>
<P>NATURALISTS tell us, that the Blood of
the Creature at that time, is boiling hot; and
though it be not in a <HI>Fever,</HI> which, they say,
in a Dog is Madness; or in Cats, and some other
Creatures, because it does not lie in the
Head, as it does in Dogs, and ssch other Crea∣tures
as are subject to Madness, yet that
the Spirits are in as high a ferment in these,
as those are.</P>
<P>BE that as it will, 'tis certain this is the Work
of Nature, not a Disease upon Nature; and
when the End, which is Generation and Pro∣pagation
of the Kind, is answered; when the
Season is over, the Creature returns to its na∣tural
calm and quiet; to a Disposition familiar
and domestick; will come up to the Keeper,
feed out of his hand, and be as tame again
as before.</P>
<P>THIS fury of the Blood, however raging in
the Buck, I say abates with the Season, and
he returns to be the same gentle pleasant Crea∣ture
he was before. But it is not so with the
Man; when the fury of his Appetite, prompt∣ed
by the youth of his Spirit, rises to a highth
a little more than common, it continues there;
'tis not slacked by the Evacuations natural to
the Case, but he continues a Madman still, and
knows no Bounds.</P>
<P>IN vain is Reason given him, and intended
by the Giver to be the guide and the govern∣er
of his Life; to be his Director, and to com∣mand
his Passions and Affections; his Appetite
getting once the government, like a hard∣mouth'd
<PB N="297" REF="313"/>
Horse, he feels no Curb, knows no
Restraint, and is guided by no Reins but those
of his enraged Will.</P>
<P>I can describe the Article I am upon by
no Mediums but those of Simily and Allegory.
Decency forbids me speaking plainer than this.
The Man is a Fury, and knows no limits to
the Rage of his Inclination; but, pushed on by
the Heat of ungoverned Nature, and suppo∣sing
an unlimited Liberty is given him by the
Marriage-Licence, which, by the way, is a
mistake, he acts all the immodest Things ima∣ginable
with a suggested Impunity.</P>
<P>HENCE Sodomy it self has been not only
acted, but even justify'd in the Marriage-Bed;
and indeed, one may be expected as well as
the other; for why may we not look for one
unnatural Excess, as well as another.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turks,</HI> 'tis a little hard I must be forced
to leave the Practice of Christians, and go look
among the <HI>Turks</HI> and Infidels for Examples of
Modesty and Decency, but so it is; the <HI>Turks,</HI>
I say, have brought this very Offence which
I complain of, under the Government of their
Laws; and, as I said before, it is remarkable,
and a Pattern for Christians, that they try
those Causes in a manner much more awful
and grave than we do.</P>
<P>NOR is the Woman under that Restraint,
which they are here, where, tho' she is perhaps
grosly injured, she cannot do her self Justice,
because Modesty forbids her Tongue expressing
the Particulars, and describing the Fact. But
there, if any unlawful Violence is offered to a
Woman by her Husband, under the Liberties
of the Marriage-Bed, and she finds her self so
<PB N="298" REF="314"/>
aggrieved, as that she is obliged to seek redress,
she proceeds thus:</P>
<P>1. SHE goes to the proper Officer, and de∣mands
a Summons for her Husband to appear
before the Grand Vizier, to answer to her Com∣plaint.</P>
<P>2. WHEN he appears, and she is call'd in to
justify her Charge, she says not a Word; nor
is her Face unveiled, till she comes to what we
call taking her Oath: But then, unveiling her
Face, she stoops down, takes off her Slipper in
the Face of the Court, and holds it up to the
Judge (the Grand Vizier) turning it the wrong
Side upward.</P>
<P>THIS is enough to the Court, who understand
her distinctly, namely, that she swears upon
the <HI>Alchoran</HI> that her Husband offers unnatural
Violences to her, and that she cannot live with
him upon that Account. She needs say no
more; but upon this Process she obtains a Di∣vorce
against him, unless he can do one or both
of the following Things:</P>
<P>1. CLEAR himself of the Charge; or,</P>
<P>2. GIVE sufficient Security for not offering
the like to her again.</P>
<P>THERE is no need to demand a farther Ex∣planation
of these Things, or to ask me, what
is meant by offering unnatural Violences to a
Wife? Those Questions aim evidently at what
I have from the Beginning protested against;
and any just and modest Reader will understand
what I mean by that.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="315"/>
IT is enough to tell you, that the very
Thing I complain of in the Head of this
Chapter is one of them: It is enough, that the
Woman has conceived, and is with Child.
What can be desired of her more, is, in the
Language of <HI>Mahometan</HI> Modesty, a Violence,
nay, an unnatural Violence; and the Woman
complains of it as highly injurious.</P>
<P>THE Woman has indeed a strong and unan∣swerable
Argument against the Man in case of
this Complaint, which, 'tis true, we cannot
plead here; namely, that she holds up two,
or three Sticks, which are given her by the Offi∣cers,
intimating, that her Husband can plead
no Necessity for his using her in that manner,
for that he has one, two or three Wives be∣sides
her, according to the Number of Sticks
which she exposes, or holds up, and that there∣fore
he ought to let her alone to go on in her
Pregnancy, that she may bring forth a Man
Child without danger of Miscarriage, which,
'tis suggested, might otherwise happen to her
by that Violence.</P>
<P>I very much doubt this will be called a new
Doctrine here; and I have been told already
(by a Man of Modesty too) upon reading it in
the Manuscript, that I shall never persuade
Christians to believe it Criminal, whatever
the <HI>Turks</HI> may do. But why should I suspect
this, where, as I said before, it is not the Law
of Matrimony, or the Law of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI>
that I am mentioning, but the Law of Nature;
though Cuftom may be argued to be a Law,
or as a Law, and that in many Things. Custom
is a Tyrant; Nature is a just and limited Go∣vernment.
Custom is Anarchy and Confusion;
<PB N="300" REF="316"/>
Nature is a regulated Monarchy, and a well∣established
Constitution.</P>
<P>BUT, to go farther; the Law I am speaking
of, is Nature, supported by Reason; or, if you
please, Reason supported by Nature. Reason
thinks it just to follow where Nature leads,
and where there is no just and rational Ob∣jection
against her Dictates, because Nature is
certainly judge of her own Constitutions, and
best knows her own Actings; her Influences
run in secret Channels, which no Force ought
to obstruct, and, when they do not swell be∣yond
Bounds, ought not to be check'd and stop'd
up.</P>
<P>THERE are many Arguments in Philosophy,
as well as in Medicine or Physick, why the
Course of Nature should not be obstructed and
interrupted; and except where her Exorbi∣tances
seem to break out into Offence, she
ought not to be restrained, and even there
but gently and with good Reason, and in its
proper Time.</P>
<P>BUT Custom pretends to govern Nature with
a kind of absolute Dominion, and to tyran∣nize
over all the Laws of Reason and of Na∣ture
too.</P>
<L>“Custom, which all Mankind to Slav'ry brings,</L>
<L>That dull Excuse for doing silly Things.”</L>
<P>NOW if Custom has set up a vitious Practice,
in contradiction to Nature and Reason too,
shall this be a received Law among us, who
pretend to know and practise so well? Besides, as
the Devil said to the Sons of <HI>Sceva,</HI> Nature we
know, Reason we know, but who are you?
You, Custom, you are an Invader and an Usur∣per;
<PB N="301" REF="317"/>
an Invader of Nature, and an Usurper of
the Throne of Reason, that sets up for a Judge
of Convenience, and a Judge of Right and
Wrong, to which you have no more Claim
than you have to judge of Truth and Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>IN all such Cases, it is but a just Enquiry to
make here, What is this Custom derived from?
And I am sure, in this Case, it must be an∣swered,
this Custom is begun in Crime; it is
derived from an Offence; and, as is the Tree,
such is the Fruit, offensive; for this Evil Tree
cannot bring forth good Fruit; it derives from
vitiated and corrupt Affections, heated Blood,
and debauch'd suppress'd Reason.</P>
<P>DO Men gather Grapes of these Thorns?
Can good come out of this Evil? Corrupt Ap∣petite,
unrestrained Will, break out in corrupt
Actions, and continued in, grow up to corrupt
Habits, and this we call Custom; when it is
grown up to that Name, Custom, it immedi∣ately
begins to Tyrannize, and make it self
an Excuse for its own Errors. In a word, Men
go on in a Custom, because it is a Custom;
so it gets Years on its Side, and then 'tis called
an old Custom, an antient Custom, which adds
Veneration to it, and, at last, an immemorial
Custom, or, as we vulgarly express it, <HI>a Custom,
Time out of mind;</HI> which is sufficient to make
a Law of it.</P>
<P>THIS Corruption usurped upon Nature, and,
turned into Custom, is the Thing we have to
combat with in the Article before us, in which
we have this lawful Plea to bring against it;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That Custom in Crime is just as much a
Defence for it, as Antiquity, in Error, and is
indeed the same thing; and so, in the Case
<PB N="302" REF="318"/>
before me; for a Man to say, I have always
done so, you startle me a little, 'tis true, I did not
examine into the thing, but I never made any
hesitation about it; 'tis a Custom, and, I be∣lieve,
every Body does it as well as we; and
therefore I cannot think 'tis a Crime; you
must preach it down in general; when it comes
to be chang'd by other People, I'll think of
it, but, I believe, every Body does so, as well
as I.</P>
<P>THESE are really dangerous, as well as
unjust Arguings, and the more so, because
they are too true, and too real. But what
is then to be done? Must Custom, founded up∣on
the most scandalous Mistake, take Place?
It was, in its very original, an Encroachment
upon Nature, upon Modesty, and upon Tem∣perance,
and shall we plead its Antiquity,
which is so far from an Excuse, that it is
an addition to its Crime; this is as if a con∣victed
Highwaymen should plead for Mercy,
because he had been forty Years in the Trade,
an old Offender, and long practis'd in the
Crime.</P>
<P>IF the Custom is wicked; if it is, in its
original, a Treason against Virtue, and an En∣croachment
upon Nature; will any Man plead
for the Practice, because their Ancestors were
guilty of it before them.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed a happy Article in this Argu∣ment,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that there is not one Word of Excuse
for it, but this foolish Plea of its being a
Custom; all other Arguments are against it; 'tis
evidently a Pollution in Nature, a Scandal to its
Purity, to its Virtue, to its Moderation, and
to all that can be called Prudent and Wise.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="319"/>
PROCREATION of the Species, and the Ge∣neration
of Mankind, is the just End of Ma∣trimony;
'tis express'd so in the Office of Matri∣mony,
and in the sacred Text, in many Places;
Now when the Woman is with Child, the End
of Matrimony is answered; the Demand is at
an End till she is light again (as the Women
call it). Some would fain plead a progressive
Conception, and that there is a Supply wanting
to compleat the Formation of the <HI>Foetus,</HI> and a
great deal more of that Kind.</P>
<P>BUT this is evidently a Mistake, and the
contrary is manifest; the Work of Conception
is hit off at once; the Materials being furnish∣ed,
Nature being set on Work, all the forming
Parts are engaged together; they may, indeed,
be hindered and interrupted in their Opera∣tion
by future Agressions, and by the very
Offence which I complain of; but that any
addition can be made to the Work of Nature,
especially in the manner, and at the distance of
Time that we speak of, is grosly absurd, and
contrary to Nature.</P>
<P>THE limitation of Time when, as I say, the
Man should know his Wife no more, is plac'd
at so convenient a distance, as that of her be∣ing
known to be with Child. If there were
any such Thing as a second Conception, or ad∣ditions
to the Work of Conception, auxiliar to
Nature; I say, if there were any such thing, as
I can by no means grant, tho' I do not dispute
it here; yet 'tis evident it must be at or about
the Beginning of the Conception, not at four
or five Months distance of Time, for then a
Woman might go with two or more Children at
once, and bring them forth four or five Months
after one another; nay, a Woman might be
<PB N="304" REF="320"/>
always Conceiving, always Breeding, and al∣ways
Bearing or Bringing forth.</P>
<P>WHETHER must these gross Ideas lead us?
And into what Absurdities must we run in our
Thoughts of them? Let those that can con∣ceive
thus of such Matters, enter into a Deci∣cision
of the Controversy; I think, our present
Subject is no farther concerned to answer them,
than only to appeal to Reason and Experience,
and to all the learned Anatomists and <HI>Accouch∣ers,</HI>
to judge of it.</P>
<P>I observe, when I hint the Modesty of <HI>Ma h∣ometan</HI>
Nations, and other People, who, as I
have said, abstain from their Wives as soon as
they have Conceived, or, to put it right, as
soon as they know they are with Child; I am
answered with a kind of eagerness, that it is
easy to them, because having Plurality of
Women, or being allowed as many Wives as
they will, they can lay by one, and take
another as they please; so that they are never
without a Wife; but as soon as one is with Child,
she withdraws to her Apartment, and he knows
her no more. But then he calls another to his
Bed; and as she may continue four or five
Months before he can be sure she is with Child,
by that time the first is sure to be delivered,
and be ready for his Bed again; and so of all
the Wives in their Turn. And thus the Man
is never without a Woman for his Conve∣nience.</P>
<P>IF this be so, all that can be said for it
is, that this is a kind of Argument in favour
of Poligamy, that is to say, that we make use
of it as such. But the <HI>Turks</HI> are very far from
giving this as a Reason for their Poligamy:
The Reason of that Practice is taken from the
<PB N="305" REF="321"/>
Custom of the Patriarchs, and is made a Part
of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Law; and if they were not so
allowed the use of many Women promiscuously,
it is certain they would still abstain from their
Wives, during the time of their being with
Child.</P>
<P>IT is looked upon as a preposterous Thing,
a Pollution and Impurity; nay, they take it
to be nauseous and unnatural; the sober
Men among them speak of it with detestation,
and upbraid the Christians with it as acting
more than Beastial, for that very few of the
brute Creatures practise it; and, if you consider
it with exactness, you will not find any of the
Brutes that will admit, much less seek the Con∣junction
of their Sexes after Conception: However
eager when Nature prompted, and however
loud the Female calls the Male, yet, after the
Fire of Nature is quenched, she fights him, and
flies at him if he attacks her.</P>
<P>IT would be an unpleasant Task, and un∣suitable
to the just Restraint which I have put
upon my self in the first Undertaking of this
difficult Work, if I should pretend to enter
here into a Philosophical or Anatomical De∣scription
of the Reason and Nature of the
brutal Appetites; their Seasons, their Conduct
in them, and their punctual observing the
Laws of Nature in the various Circumstances
of those Seasons; their Conception; their
bringing forth their young; their suckling
and nourishing them afterwards; how regular,
how exact, and how punctual the Creatures are
to those Seasons; and how modest and uncon∣cerned
with one another when thos Seasons
are past, or in the due Intervals of them.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="322"/>
I say, it would be an improper Search under
the Limitations which I am otherwise bound
by; the Enquiry would be very improving,
critical and curious; and such a Thing may not
be unprofitable in Surgery and Anatomy: But,
at present, our Subject points another Way;
and I am rather discoursing the Morality, as well
as the Modesty of it, the rational, not physical
Foundation of it; and searching into the Rea∣son
why we give our selves such Liberties which
the Savages, and undirected Part of Mankind,
do not take.</P>
<P>AS to the weak Excuse, that the <HI>Mahometan</HI>
and <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations have a Plurality of Women,
so that they supply Nature's demands another
Way, 'tis a most scandalous Confession, that
the vitious Part of the Man is the only occasion
of the Practice; and that this is done, not that
it is supposed to be right, but because the Power
of the Vice prevails, and the Appetite rules the
Man, the Reason, and Nature is subjected to
Desire, and the pure Flame is overborn by the
impure eruption of Salt and Sulphur.</P>
<P>AND where's the Christian all this while?
Where are the necessary Mortifications of a
holy Life? Where do such mortify the Deeds
of the Body? <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 13. How have they
<HI>crucified the Flesh with its Affections and Lusts?</HI>
Gal. v. 24.</P>
<P>SHALL Christians, that pretend to walk by
the pure Pattern of their Saviour and his Apo∣stles,
and by the perfect Rule of the Scripture,
at the same time plead a necessity of Polluting
themselves, and that in a filthy and loathsome
manner; a manner which they cannot speak of
without Blushes; shall these plead a supply of the
<PB N="307" REF="323"/>
Demands of Nature, and a necessity for want
of a Plurality of Women?</P>
<P>HOW ought such rather to remember, that
they are Christians, and that the double Obli∣gation
lies upon them to abstain from such
Things, by how much they pretend to a great∣er
Asslistance in their Mortifications from supe∣rior
and invisible Helps of Religion? How
do we fee the Clergy of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church
devote themselves to a perpetual Celibacy, and
enter into solemn Vows of Chastity, and per∣form
them too; for tho' some may offend, we
cannot, with common Justice, charge it upon
the whole Body of the Clergy, and of the Re∣ligious
People?</P>
<P>AND shall Protestants only pretend to a
necessity of Crime, and that they cannot re∣strain
themselves from secret Lewdness, or
keep themselves from shameful Pollutions,
but that they must allow themselves to act
against Nature, and against Virtue, and even
against the Stomach? This is the grossest Piece
of confess'd Frailty that one can meet with
any where, and nothing that I know in Story
can come up to it.</P>
<P>AS to the Abstinence of those who, in some
Countries, are allowed a Plurality of Wives,
we are assured that some, yea, many of them,
after having had the Knowledge of one of their
Women, they knew her no more, till they have
an Assurance that she has not conceived, and
that she is not with Child. The Grand Seig∣nior,
'tis certain, acts thus among the Ladies of
the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and, if we may believe some who
pretend to know, lives a much more temperate
Life, nd acts with a great deal more Modera∣tion
among three or four hundred Ladies, all at
<PB N="308" REF="324"/>
his Command, than the Gentlemen I am speak∣ing
of do, with one Wife, and no more.</P>
<P>IN a word; among those People, for a Man
to know a Woman after she was already with
Child, would be detestable, it would be an abo∣mination
to them; the Woman would refuse it
with as much Resolution as she would a Ra∣visher,
and the Man must be abandoned to all
that was counted brutish and unclean, that
should offer it.</P>
<P>WHETHER it be so among us, or how it is
received and pratised among us Christians, I
leave to the general Opinion, and to private
Experience, not meddling with that Part, as
too gross for me; though I might give Examples
too notorious, from the Mouths of our flagrant
Friends of the unblushing Club at <HI>Tony</HI>'s—,
and from the Testimony and Confession of a∣bundance
of the modest Society at—'s, be∣sides
some of the Ladies who have intermed∣dled
so lately, I do not say so decently, in the
Affair, as to be partly the occasion of this
very Chapter, and of all the Parts of it; of
whom my wonderful Concern for their Fame,
gives me leave to say no more. It were to be
wished, that they would, for the future, be
as careful of their own Characters, as I
am.</P>
<P>I am sorry, after all I have said upon this
filthy Subject, to observe, that here are yet
no want of Advocates to defend the Prac∣tice;
though I must add, that there is a per∣fect
sterility of Argument, or, at least, rea∣sonable
Arguments, to support their Defence
of it.</P>
<P>WHAT they say amounts to so little, and
that little is so scandalous in its Nature, and
<PB N="309" REF="325"/>
sits so ill upon the Tongues of Men of Virtue
and Moderation, much less Men of Christia∣nity
and Religion, that I blush for them, and
conceal it. Nothing requires a more just and
severe Censure, except it be the Action they
would defend by it.</P>
<P>TO say they cannot refrain, is to confess a
frailty which Papists and Popish Votaries de∣spise,
and pretend to make slight of, nay,
which <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> overcome by the
Power of their Religion. The <HI>Nuns</HI> dedicated
to <HI>Christ,</HI> and to such and such Saints, undertake
to preserve an entire Chastity; and the Reli∣gious
Orders of Monks and Friars do the
same; the Clergy universsally make no Diffi∣culty
of it, and this for the length of their
whole Lives. And shall Protestants not be a∣shamed
to say they cannot—for so little
a Time, and so just an Occasion? 'Tis a most
shameful Necessity they are under; if the
Fact be true, they ought, as I said in another
Case, take Physick, use Medicine, and strive
by justifiable Methods, to abate the Acri∣mony
of their Blood, bringing themselves into
a Rule or Regimen of Diet, that they may re∣move
the Cause, and enable them to command
their raging Desires, by weakening the Desire
it self.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more certain, than that luxu∣rious,
living, eating and drinking, what we
call rich Diet, high Sauces, strong Wines, and
other Incentives, are great Occasions of Vice;
are Provocatives, and Raisers of other and more
scandalous Appetites; the Blood is heated and
fired, and the Spirits are inflamed; Nature is
elevated and prompted, and then we Plead and
Argue what we ought to be ashamed so much
<PB N="310" REF="326"/>
to name, and would Blush to do it it another
time.</P>
<P>THIS Luxury is not only a Sin in its own
Nature, but it is a strong Motive to other Sins;
'tis the <HI>Devil</HI> at the Elbow, prompting and ex∣citing,
and we ought to avoid the Cause as we
would obey the Scripture, which says, <HI>Flee
youthful Lusts;</HI> the Reason is given in the
very same Verse, for they <HI>War against the Soul;</HI>
they raise a Tumult in the Man, they arm his
Vices against his Reason, and procure him Ene∣mies,
even from within, that are too hard for
him; in short, they raise the Devil, which he
cannot lay.</P>
<P>IT is an undeniable Maxim, that a luxu∣rious
Appetite in eating and drinking raises an
ungoverned Appetite in other Pleasures; Na∣ture
obeys its own Laws: Great takings in
must have great goings out; gross sseding, and
strong rich taking in of Diet, must have Eva∣cuations
in proportion; if there is an Acrimony
in the Blood, there is a physical Application
necessary in its Course; great Digestures must
have strong Emeticks; there must be Evacua∣tions
of one Sort or other.</P>
<P>NOW a vitiated Appetite of one kind is the
Effect of a vitiated gorging the Appetite on
the other; and the gross feeding occasions gross
Desires; on the other hand, to restrain and
limit the Appetite in eating and drinking, is
the only Way to get a compleat Victory over
our own Corruption.</P>
<P>A mortified Mind therefore, a Soul resolv'd
not to be overcome, or be <HI>drawn aside of its own
Lusts, and enticed,</HI> but resolved to mortify the
Flesh, with its Affections and Lusts, would
restrain it self voluntarily, and subdue all the Oc∣casions
<PB N="311" REF="327"/>
of the Crime. Certainly high feeding is
the Original of high Vices, and brings the worst
Inconveniences of this kind upon the Man.
Hence Fastings were introduced in the primi∣tive
Churches, and Mortifications, in order to
bring under the Body, and bring the Flesh
into Subjection; and they are practis'd among
the most devout of the Popish Recluses to this
time, in order to enable them to restrain natu∣ral
Inclination, and they do find them ef∣fectual;
the abating the quantity of Animal
Food, the pungent Particles of which sharpen
the Blood, press upon the Nerves, and give an
ungoverned Vigour to the Spirits, is certainly
the Way, and an effectual Way to reduce the
Corruptions to the Government both of Reason
and Religion.</P>
<P>IF this Devil cannot be cast out but by
<HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fasting,</HI> then <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Fasting</HI>
must be practis'd; for the Evil Spirit must be
cast out, and the strong Man must be dispossess'd.</P>
<P>NOR is it necessary upon a religious Account
only, and to reduce us to the Rank of Chri∣stians;
but indeed, 'tis necessary in the Case
before us, to bring us to a due Exercise of our
Reason, and to act like Men, that we may not
live like human Beasts, without all Govern∣ment,
and without any Subjection to the Domi∣nion
of our Reason.</P>
<P>THIS then is the true Way to take off that
pitious Plea, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they cannot restrain
themselves. To act reasonably would be to re∣strain
our selves; and those that really can∣not
so restrain themselves, grant, that they have
not the exercise of their Reason. If due Mor∣tifications
were practised, the difficulty of re∣straining
themselves would be taken away; in
<PB N="312" REF="328"/>
the particular Case I am speaking of, and the
Inclination would not be able to conquer the
Aversion; for there must certainly be some∣thing
shocking to Nature in the Thing it self;
and there wants nothing but a decay of the
Ferment in the Blood to make the Victory
easy, and to bring the Enemy to be subdued.</P>
<P>AND to add to this Physical Resolution the
Methods of Diet, why should not both Men
and Women tie themselves by solemn Vows,
Promises and religious Resolutions, to keep
themselves within Bounds? Perhaps then they
would assist one another in the Performance.
Why do not <HI>Protestants,</HI> as well as <HI>Papists,</HI> enter
into Vows of Continence? No doubt if they
would be assistant to one another to break those
Charms of Hell, those Filtres and Bewitchings,
which are certainly the Attacks of the Devil,
they might break them.</P>
<P>DID they do this, they would fortify one
another in the Ways of Virtue; and it would
not be so easy to be drawn into Crime; a three∣fold
Cord is not easily broken, and here is a
threefold Help: As, (1.) A Conviction that you
ought to perform it. (2.) A solemn Vow to
engage the Performance. And, (3.) Mutual
Assistance both in the Vow and in the Resolu∣tion,
to pay it.</P>
<P>I would hope, that this vile Practice is car∣ried
on among us, rather for want of knowing
how offensive it is, than for want of Power to
resolve a Performance, and to engage the Mind
in it Custom has made the Vice, however
odious in it self, so natural to us, that there
are thousands of People among us at this
time, who, if you should ask about it, would
<PB N="313" REF="329"/>
readily answer with a surprize, <HI>I profess I never
thought it had been an Offence.</HI></P>
<P>MEN go into it eager, without Considera∣tion.
Nature gives faint checks to the Mind;
for even Nature, left entirely to it self, would
yet have some Reluctance, and would a little
recoil at the unnatural Action. But the Men
are us'd to it; there is no express Law against
it; they fee no notice taken of it in the Scrip∣ture,
or in any subsequent Institutions; they
are under no Reftraints of that kind; and
where should they then be restrained, and by
what?</P>
<P>IGNORANCE then of the nature of the Of∣fence,
renders the Man in danger of commit∣ting
it. The Custom of the Country he lives
in is a terrible Plea, and he is too apt to cleave
to it, and venture upon the Custom; he
knows no Law against it, and therefore sees
no Crime, no Breach of any Law in the com∣mitting
it.</P>
<P>HOW weak is corrupted Nature not to see
the Scandal of so really odious and filthy a
Practice? And how far is this Ignorance from
being an Excuse? It is indeed a Sin of Igno∣rance,
but then it is a criminal ignorance too,
and so it makes no excuse for, but aggravates the
Charge, as Murther committed in Drunken∣ness
is an aggravated Murther.</P>
<P>TO be ignorant of a thing that Nature dic∣tates,
is shutting the Eyes against natural
Light; resisting the most powerful Motive that
can be found opposing it. Why do not such
People open their Eyes? Nature assists them to
do it; but the debauched Inclination will fully
close them; so that the Ignorance is really as
criminal as the Action.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="330"/>
SAINT <HI>Francis,</HI> if you will believe the Writers
of his History, was particularly persecuted
with wicked and raging Inclinations to Wo∣men;
and the Devil, who, by the way, knows
how to prompt us in that particular Article,
where Nature is weakest and most inclined to
yield, often laid Snares for him, and would
appear to him in the shape of a beautiful Lady,
or in the appearance of lewd and indecent
Gestures. But to resist him, and keep down
the rebelling Vice in his Blood, he would fall
upon his Body, with the Scourge and the Dis∣cipline.
Ha! Brother Ass, says he, <HI>that was the
best Title he could give his Carkass,</HI> do you want
Correction? Is your Blood so hot still? Then
he would fast forty Hours, and all the while
whip and tear himself with a Wire Scourge, till
he made the Blood come.</P>
<P>BE the History true or not, the Moral is
good. The unmortified pampered Carkass is
the real Fund of all these raging, tyrannizing
Inclinations, which we make our simple Ex∣cuses
for doing sordid Things, and though I do
not prescribe Disciplines and Fastings, by way
of meritorious Mortification in this Case, as
the Papists do; yet I must tell my guilty Rea∣der,
they are absolutely necessary in the Case,
to reduce the (Carkass) Body into a due Sub∣jection
to (the Soul) Reason; and he that can∣not
otherwise conquer an outrageous Appetite,
ought, and must use the proper Methods to re∣duce
it; the Cause must be taken away that
the Effect may cease.</P>
<P>A Man who not only has a rational Soul,
but has the Powers and Faculties of it, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
His Understanding and Will in their due Ex∣ercise,
should be ashamed to say, he cannot re∣strain
<PB N="315" REF="331"/>
this or that corrupt Affection; the Af∣fections
are certainly regimented in a subor∣dinate
Station in the Soul, and are placed in
subjection to the Understanding. He that
gives them leave to advance beyond their
Appointment, suffers his Soul to be hurry'd
down the Stream of the Affections, is so far
divested of himself, and out of his own Go∣vernment,
and ought to use rational Means to
recover the Exercise of his Reason, and to give
those upstart tumultuous Things, called the Af∣fections,
a due and severe Check.</P>
<P>THIS Doctrine of Discipline and Mortifi∣cation,
how much soever it may look like
Popery, is notwithstanding a most absolutely
necessary thing in the Life of a Man of Sense;
and tho' I am not talking of it here as a
religious Exercise, at least not in the Man∣ner
and on the Principle of Merit, as the <HI>Pa∣pists</HI>
practise it; yet I must own, 'tis the most
effectual Means to answer the End in such Cases
as these.</P>
<P>IF it be true, that the Affections, which are
the grossest Part of the Man, are up in Arms;
if this Mob is rais'd in his Soul, for such it is,
the Militia must be rais'd to suppress them;
Violence must be suppress'd, by Violence; the
Torrent must be check'd, and the Man be re∣duced
to the Government of himself, and
brought into good Order by proper Powers;
for as it is (in short) a Tumult in his Soul,
and a Rebellion against the just Dominion of
his Reason, so he must use the means Nature
has put into his hand to quash and suppress the
Rebellion, and chain them down like Galley∣Slaves
to the Oar, to humble and mortify
them.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="332"/>
THE Allegory is good; it is the highth of the
Animal Spirits which Occasions all the Exor∣bitances
in the Affections, and those Heats are
to be abated by Austerities and Discipline.
Nature calls for it, whether Religion calls for
it or no; it is a Political, as well as a Physical
Method; Prudence will direct; and any Phy∣sician,
if you were honestly to tell him your
Case, would take it as a Disease in the Blood,
an Inflammation and Fever in the Head, or
elsewhere, and would prescribe you just such
Physick, such Abstinence, and such Mortifi∣cations
as I mention, as the best Medicine for
it as a Distemper.</P>
<P>I am the longer upon this Subject of Absti∣nence
and Mortification in this Place, because
the Pretence in this Article is, the Strength of
Inclination is too great; and that we CANNOT
compleat it, tho' it ought rather to be said,
WILL NOT. Now were it really true, that
they could not reduce and conquer the Incli∣nation
by the force of ordinary Resolution,
then the reducing the Principle of it is the
next sure and effectual Method. Water may,
if the Quantity be sufficient, conquer and put
out a Fire; but removing the Combustibles,
taking away the Fewel, is a never-failing Me∣thod;
the first may do it, but the last must do
it. No Fire burns upon it self; that which we
call Burning, is nothing but penetrating and
dividing the Particles of Matter; if the Mat∣ter
be removed, there is nothing to separate,
nothing to operate upon, and the Fire goes out
of course.</P>
<P>THE like Plea for Mortifications holds good
in most of the other Cases I have mentioned
in this Work; for should we trace all the raging
<PB N="317" REF="333"/>
Excesses which I have touch'd at in the former
Part of this Work to their true Original, we
should find much of it owing to the Extravagan∣ces
of our Living in <HI>England;</HI> I mean, as to
eating and drinking. What is the Reason we
have so many People die of Fevers here more
than in any other Part of the World? and that,
every Year or two, we have what we call a
new Distemper, which carries off so many,
that at those Seasons the Weekly Bills in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
rise up to six hundred or seven hundred a
Week? Why is the Small-Pox so fatal, and par∣ticularly
among the Gentry and Persons of
Distinction, but because of the Excesses of eat∣ing
and drinking, in which, as well as in the
Nature of what we eat and drink, we go beyond
the rest of Mankind?</P>
<P>THE same Reason is to be given for other
Things; the same Excesses ferment the Blood,
raise the Spirits, and produce all the immo∣derate
scandalous Things which I have been
complaining of, and which there is so much
Reason to complain of among us; in which
the <HI>Turks</HI> and Savages appear to act more like
Men of Reason than we do.</P>
<P>THEIR Way of Living is not so high;
their Blood does not boil with the same in∣temperate
Heats, consequently their Abstinence
is not so much a Virtue; but I must add too,
that our Incontinence is the more a Vice; 'tis
a Crime occasioned by a Crime; and we ought
to use Temperance first in our Diet, and then
we shall, with the more ease, practice Temper∣ance
in other Things.</P>
<P>THE Crime of <HI>Sodom,</HI> however unnatural
the Vices are which they practised, is laid all
upon a Cause, which was of the same Kind with
<PB N="318" REF="334"/>
ours, Pride and Idleness, and Fulness of
Bread. By which I understand, that their las∣civious
Wickedness proceeded from their luxu∣rious
Diet; Sloth and Gluttony enraged their
Blood; and they fat upon the high Places to
do Evil.</P>
<P>OUR fulness of Bread must be acknowledg'd
to be a great Assistant to our immoderate Appe∣tite
another Way; for this high Feeding gives
high Spirits, and these prompt to all exorbitant
Crimes. Excess of the Animal Spirits fill and
fire the Blood, and when those heats rage, then
the Head contrives Wickedness. I need not speak
it plainer, the Case is easily understood. No
thing can bring us to a Life of Moderation in
our Pleasures, like a Life of Temperance and
Moderation in eating and drinking.</P>
<P>BUT I come from the Cause to the Crime;
and must say a Word or two more to that.</P>
<P>AMONG all the brutish Circumstances of it,
this is one, that 'tis an Action stript of all mo∣dest
Pretences, all tolerable Excuses; as it is a
meer Act of Pollution, so there is not one
Word to be said to extenuate it; the Man can
only say, that he does it as an Excursion of
meer sensuality, or a gratification to the Flesh.
There can be no End in it, or Reason for it,
that can be so much as named without Blush∣ing.
The Woman is with Child, that's suppo∣sed.
It is known, and she acknowledges it.
What then can be said on that Side? The End
of the conjugal Act is already answered;
Wherefore does he come near her? 'Tis only to
satisfy the cravings of his Vice, only to gra∣tify
his frailest Part, to please himself, or, as
the Scripture says, to sulfil the Lusts of the
Flesh.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="335"/>
THIS is an End so base, so mean, so absurd,
that no Christian Man can plead it in Excuse;
and yet, at the same time, 'tis impossible to
find any other Excuse for it: In short, it is a
meer shameless use of a Woman, to abate the
heat of his Spirits, and cool his Blood; 'tis
making a <HI>Necessary-House</HI> of his Wife, and no∣thing
more or less; and that indeed is a sordid
Thing, so much as in the suggestion of it; 'tis
adding Scandal to the Crime, covering it with∣out
a Cover; there's no Excuse can be made
for it, no tolerable Name be given to it (that
I can find at least) but this of Matrimonial
Whoredom, according to my Title.</P>
<P>LET us then think of reforming this scan∣dalous
Practice; let us look at it in a due Per∣spective,
in a clear open Light. If any one
thing can with Modefty be said in Defence of
it, let us hear it; if not, if it is to be only
confess'd as a Crime, let it be forsaken as a
Crime. What cannot be defended, ought to be
reformed: What every one is ashamed to speak
for, none should be ashamed to forsake.</P>
<P>I could offer some Examples upon this Sub∣ject,
but they are of such a course kind, that
it is too foul to mention; there's no entring
into the Particulars; it would offend the
Ears of all those that have the least Pretence
to Modesty. Some of our worthy Neighbours
will indeed, on this very Score, pass unreproved,
and the filthy Circumstances not be animad∣verted
upon, because they cannot be mentioned;
but it is so, it cannot be helped, so they must
escape.</P>
<P>I have the Honour to converse with some
Gentlemen so abstenious, that they are able to
clear themselves of this Charge; and 'tis to
<PB N="320" REF="336"/>
their Honour that I mention it; though, but in
general, Sir <HI>W—G—,</HI> and his Lady, have
treated one another always with such Justice,
and with such Reserve in this Case, that as soon
as ever the Lady has found her self with Child,
she always lodged in Apartments by her self,
till she was delivered, and the like at other Sea∣sons;
that no Occasion might offer, where there
was so much Love, to have any excess.</P>
<P>NOR has this modest Custom been so much a
Stranger to our Ancestors, as it seems to have
been to us; a Truth not at all to our Advan∣tage;
this was, without doubt, the Original
of that good Custom among Persons of Qua∣lity,
and of any tolerable Fortunes, to have
separate Apartments, the Gentleman's Lodg∣ings
and the Lady's being separate, so that,
when Decency required, they went from one
another for a while, till proper Times return∣ed,
and made Lodging together reasonable
again.</P>
<P>IT is true, middling Families have not this
Convenience, and cannot keep separate Lodg∣ings
furnished for one another; it may be said
of such indeed, that they have the greater ex∣ercise
for their Virtue, because they are obliged
always to lodge together. But how great so∣ever
the Exercise is, and how difficult foever
to be put in Practice, still, as it is a Virtue, it
ought to be strictly observed; nor, in my
Opinion, can any Man be said to live a Life
of Virtue that neglects it.</P>
<P>THE rest is all Prostitution; nay, 'tis worse,
'tis unnatural, 'tis a kind of lesser <HI>Sodomy;</HI> for,
I doubt not, but <HI>Sodom</HI>'s Sins, the Foundation
of which was laid, as I have observed, in high
feeding, emphatically express'd in the sacred
<PB N="321" REF="337"/>
Text by <HI>Fulness of Bread,</HI> so the Consequences
broke out in divers other Excesses, besides that
one detestable Crime, which bears the Name and
Reproach of the Place to this Day. Their gor∣ged
Stomachs discovered themselves, no doubt,
in all the Excesses of a provoked Appetite, and
an inflamed Blood; and it is so, in like Cases,
to this Day.</P>
<P>WE have a Testimony of this in all Places,
and, I may say, in all Ages of the World: The
high Feeders are the high Livers; excess of
Wine is described in Scripture to produce excess
of Vice, and the Fire of Nature burns in pro∣portion
to the Fewel. Hence the <HI>Italians,</HI> a
Nation who revel in all the Varieties of Lux∣ury,
such as rich Wines, luscious Fruits, high
Sauces, Pickles, Preserves, Sweet-meats, and
Perfumes, to an Excess. How do the hellish
Fires rage in them? How do they run out to all
the Extremes of criminal. Riot, even to that
Fury of Love, called Jealousy, and this often
ending in Blood? How do they dwell in Wan∣tonness
and Lasciviousness, and carry it on to
all the most unnatural Extremes of the dead
Lake it self, and this not only now, but in the
<HI>Romans</HI> Time also it was the like.</P>
<P>AT the same time the more moderate feed∣ing
Nations round them, are in proportion, less
outrageous in their Vice, and whether it be
from any Principle of Virtue or no, they are
so by the meer Consequence of Things; they
live more sparingly; and their Blood is kept
lower, not always inflamed (as is the Case in
<HI>Italy,</HI> and other Parts of the World); they are
forbid Wine, which to these Northern Climates
is the Fewel of outrageous Actions, and leads to
innumerable Crimes.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="338"/>
How easily then is this scandalous Excess to
be cured? They have very little regard to Mo∣desty,
to the demands of their Reason or of
Religion, who will not reduce themselves to a
moderate Degree of Heat, in order to mortify
such criminal Desires as these; if a little
abatement of Wine, or of strong nourishing
and rich Diets, and feeding more sparingly,
would do it, they must have no desire to live
within Bounds, like Christians, and like Men,
who will not abate a little at the Trencher, that
they may be able to abate in another Place.</P>
<P>GLUTTONY and Drunkenness are too near
a-kin to the Debaucheries of Love, as they may
well be stiled, not to be called the Parents of
the Vice. If you restrain the Original, you
cut off the sequent Crime; if the Springs are
cut off, the Streams will soon fail; if the Foun∣tains
are stopt, the Rivers will soon be dry;
and they that will not suffer so small a Morti∣fication
as the denying themselves a little in
the excesses of the Table and the Bottle, in
order to abate some of the more criminal Ex∣cesses
in the other Place, loudly tells us, they
are in love with the Crime, that they are
pleas'd with the Vice; and that it is not that
they cannot restrain themselves, but that, de∣lighting
in the vile Part, they don't desire to
restrain themselves, or to be restrained; that
they will not remove the Fewel, lest the Fire
should abate: Thus one Excess follows another;
a Debauchery of one kind follows the Debauch∣ery
of another; the Matrimonial Whoredom
follows the Drunkenness and the Gluttony, by
the same Necessity, and as naturally as tho
Consequence follows the Cause; the Influx oc∣casions
the Efflux, and the Man is but the
<PB N="323" REF="339"/>
same; he is a Voluntier in both, a willing Ser∣vant
to the Devil, and desires not to be deliver∣ed
from the pleasing necessity.</P>
<P>I am the longer upon it here, as I said be∣fore,
because indeed 'tis the same thing in all
the other wicked things I have mentioned in
this Work. Whence comes all the indecent law∣ful
Things we have been talking of, but from
this Sin of <HI>Sodom, (viz.) Fulness of Bread?</HI>
while the Stomach is gorged with animal Food,
of which no Nation in the World feeds like us;
while the Blood is filled with these pungent
Particles, and the Veins swelled with animal
Spirits, no wonder the seminal Vessels are over
full, and summon the Man to a Dismission or
Evacuation, even at the Price of his Virtue, of
his Conscience, and of his Reason.</P>
<P>LET them that are truly desirous to prevent
this unhappy eruption of Consequences, begin
in the right Place; abate the first Mischief; let
them remove the causing Evil, and the conse∣quent
Evil will die of course.</P>
<P>A Mortification of the Palate would be an
effectual Reformation upon the Life; by a
due Regimen of Diet we might bring our
selves to be a reformed regular Nation; and I
see no other Way ever to bring it to pass.</P>
<P>WE are ruined in our Morals by lawful
Things; the Excesses in our lawful Enjoy∣ments
make them criminal; even our
needful Supplies of Life are the ruin of Life.
We not only dig our Graves with our Teeth,
by mingling our Diseases with our Food, nou∣rishing
Distemper and Life together, but we
even eat our Way into Eternity, and damn
our Souls with our Teeth; gnawing our
Way through the Doors of the Devil's Castle
<PB N="324" REF="340"/>
with our Teeth. In a word, the Drunkard
may be well said to drink himself to the Devil;
the nice eating Glutton feeds and fattens himself
up for the Devil's Slaughter-house; because one
Vice feeds another till they are made ripe for
Hell, by the distracted Use of lawful and lau∣dable
Things; making lawful and even neces∣sary
Things criminal and sowing the Seeds
of Vice in the ordinary Ploughings of meer
Nature.</P>
<P>HOW usefully might we apply this to our
particular Friends, of whom so many will
strive to Blush, when they read it. <HI>A—L—,</HI>
Esq; had never been a Whore-master if
he had not din'd so often at <HI>Puntack</HI>'s; nor had
good and grave Sir <HI>L—W—,</HI> visited <HI>Tabby
R—,</HI> by Moon-light, if he had not dwelt
so many dark Evenings at <HI>Brown</HI>'s; so he goes
from the Bottle to the Bawdy-house; in which
the Man may be said only to act Nature, and
pursue, as all the World does, the direct Course
of Cause and Consequence.</P>
<P>IF <HI>G—W—</HI> will cease to make his House
a Stews, his Marriage-Bed a Pollution, and
bring his modest Wife to a necessity of turn∣ing
her Slipper the wrong Side upward at him,
if he will be able to give a better Excuse for his
Matrimonial Whoredom, than that he can't help
it; let him cease to eat three Hours together at
Breakfast; let him not gorge <HI>at Noon</HI> till he
falls asleep at the Table, or drink <HI>at Night</HI>
till he lies under it; let him read <HI>Cornaro</HI>
of <HI>Venice,</HI> and live upon two Ounces and five
Drams a Day, and half a Pint of Wine in
three Days; I'll answer for it, his Wife shall
not lock her self up for fear of coming to Bed
to a Fury, nor swear the Peace against him to
<PB N="325" REF="341"/>
get him bound to the Behaviour of a Christian,
for fear of being murthered in the lawful Me∣thod
of Man and Wife.</P>
<P>MADMEN by Day will be Madmen by
Night; they that have no government of
themselves one Way, how should they have it
another Way? I expect it will be objected here,
that the Nations which I have named, such as
the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> though they drink no
Wine, and do not feed, as we do, upon Flesh,
yet are as wicked and vitious as other Peo∣ple.</P>
<P>THAT those Nations are vitious, may be
true; and having no Laws of Conscience or
Religion to restrain them, they are, no doubt,
much the worse. But yet I deny one Part,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that they are so privately wicked, so
<HI>(lawfully Lewd)</HI> as I call it, <HI>as we are;</HI> they have
their many Wives, as they will, but not so much
conjugal Lewdness as, I believe, we have; and
I have many Reason to think so.</P>
<P>THE Subject of this Chapter is indeed ONE,
but have I not given twenty Instances of Ma∣trimonial
Whoredom in the compass of this
Work? Is not the common ordinary Course of
our married <HI>loose Ones,</HI> a Series of most scanda∣lous
Doings; such and of such a Kind, as the
<HI>Mahometans</HI> and <HI>Savages,</HI> who have no guide but
Nature, no check but the aversions of common
Sense, would abhor?</P>
<P>OF the same Nature with this, is that of a
Man coming to his Wife after Child-bearing, and
before her Body be sufficiently cleansed from its
natural Impurities; before the Seasons set apart
for her proper Purgations are finished. This is an
Article to be lightly touch'd too, because (for∣sooth)
we will not bear to be spoken plainly to, of
<PB N="326" REF="342"/>
the Things, which we yet are openly and shame∣lesly
guilty of.</P>
<P>THIS is one of the Breaches Mankind
make in their ordinary Practice, not upon the
Laws of Decency only, but upon the Law of
Nature; for the Separation is evidently directed
by the Law of Nature; 'tis dictated from the
first Principles of that Knowledge which the
most Ignorant are furnished with of them-selves.</P>
<P>THE Women indeed ought to be the Con∣servators
of this Law; and as they seem to
have a kind of absolute Power over themselves
during their ordinary Separations, they seem to
be the most chargeable with the Breach of it;
because they are not altogether so Passive at
this time as at another.</P>
<P>IF there is a Breach of Modesty here, 'tis
on her Side chiefly, and therefore the Reproof
is to her, and ought to be so taken; for it is as
notorious a Charge upon her, as that of admitting
a Man, upon Promise of Matrimony, before it
was formed into a Marriage; which indeed,
tho' the aggressing was chargeable upon the
Man, yet the yielding or consenting which
was wholly upon the Woman's Side, and in her
Power, plainly makes her chargeable with the
Offence, makes it all her own Act and Deed;
so it is here; and the therefore it is true, that the
Crime is her's, and the Reproof is upon her,
and upon her only.</P>
<P>THE Law of GOD, in the publick Institu∣tion
of the <HI>Jewish</HI> OEconomy, states this Case
with respect to the Woman's Separation after
Child-bearing in such a manner, as that tho'
the <HI>Jewish</HI> Constitutions, being abolished, do
not seem to be binding to us, yet they are cer∣tainly
<PB N="327" REF="343"/>
a just Rule for us to state a Christian
Regimen or Government from; they are a good
Standard to measure Decency and the Laws of
good Order by: They were certainly formed
upon the most perfect Model of Justice and
Equity, perfectly suited to the Nature of the
Thing, and are binding in Decency, if they are
not absolutely so in Conscience, and under the
usual Penalties, as the rest of GOD's Law at
that time was.</P>
<P>MOST of the sacred Constitutions of the
<HI>Jewish</HI> State were enjoyn'd upon the severest
Penalty, generally of Death; being cut off
from the Congregation of the LORD, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
amongst those Things to which those Severities
were annexed, those which respected Unclean∣ness,
and natural or accidental Pollutions, were
some of the chief; such as having the Disease
of the Leprosy, Issues of Blood, nay, even
eating leavened Bread in the seven Days of
the Passover; counterseiting the sacred Oil and
the sacred Persume, were punished with Death,
<HI>that Soul was to be cut off,</HI>&amp;c. the Reason was,
because it was a despising the Legislator. But
when he comes to enjoyn the needful Purifi∣cations,
and the particular Uncleannesses
which were to be purg'd by washings and sepa∣rations,
as also for the eating of Blood, the
Reasons are given in plain Words; GOD speaks
them himself, <HI>I have separated you from other
People that ye should be mine, and ye shall be holy
unto me;</HI> as in <HI>Exodus,</HI> chap. xii. and <HI>Leviticus,</HI>
chap. xv. and xvii. and several other Places.</P>
<P>NOW if these legal Purifications were ap∣pointed
only that the People might be a more
exactly clean and sanctified People, than the
other Nations about them, the Reason holds,
<PB N="328" REF="344"/>
tho' the Sanction of that particular Constitution
is ceas'd, as in other Cases; for example, the
Law for the Man who had trespass'd upon his
Neighbour, cheated or deceived him, was made
to appoint a Sacrifice to attone for the Crime,
and restitution for the Trespass; the Crime is
still the same, though the manner of making an
atonement for it is ceased.</P>
<P>THE Uncleanness is the same, whether the
Law be in force or no. By the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Institu∣tion,
the Woman was to perform her Separa∣tion,
or, what was then called a Purification,
a certain time; upon her bringing forth a Male
Child, she performed an exact <HI>Quarentine, viz.</HI>
three and thirty Days, and seven Day; and
for a Female Child she was obliged to perform
a double <HI>Quarentine,</HI> namely, sixty and six
Days, and fourteen Days; during which time
the Man was not to be suffered to come near her,
or so much as to touch her, upon the severest
Penalties, as above.</P>
<P>NOW, not to insist upon the legal Purificati∣ons
of that strict Law, enjoyned from above, and
which had such solid Reasons given for it; yet
the Law of Nature, upon which all that Part is
originally founded, is the same. You may say,
the neglect of it is not a mortal Sin, or that
deserves Death. But you cannot say it is not
a <HI>Pudor,</HI> a shameful, an immodest Thing, or
that it is not loath some and odious, even in its
own Nature; for the Regulation of clean and
unclean, like right and wrong, is still the same,
settled and unalterable, as Things established in
the Law of Nature, which are not altered by
Customs and Habits; whether good or evil.</P>
<P>IT is true, that our Usage has reduced these
Separations and Purgations of the Sex to a
<PB N="329" REF="345"/>
Month or thirty Days, which the Law of GOD
had fixed at six Weeks; and has made no dif∣ference
in the time of the Separation between
the Circumstances of a Male or Female Birth;
for all which we give physical Reasons, such as
generally satisfy our Scruples in those Affairs;
nor is it my Business to dispute here the Reason
and Nature of the Alteration, and whether it
is sufficiently grounded. Our Physicians and
Anatomists are best able to answer for that Part,
and, I suppose, can do it.</P>
<P>BUT even, with all the abatement of Days;
and I doubt not 'tis reduced as low as it can be,
yet, <HI>I say,</HI> with that abatement we find it is
not observed; our Libertine Age breaks thro'
it all, and, if it were a Fortnight, would per∣haps
do the same; and this is the Thing I com∣plain
of; and for want of which Decency, or
Duty rather, People of this Age may be justly
said to deserve the Censure which a Wife and
good Man put lately upon them, namely, that
we have not less Holiness than our Ancestors,
nor less Honesty, but much more; only that
he thought the Holiness and the Honesty
of the Days differed, and that some Things
would pass now for Holiness and for Honesty
with us; which would not pass for such with our
Ancestors.</P>
<P>THIS indeed may alter the Case very much,
and the Ages may differ in the Species when
they do not differ in the Name of the Things;
the Standard of Virtue may alter as the Stand∣ard
of our Coins frequently do; but the real
thing, the Silver, and its intrinsick Rate or Va∣lue
alters not, 'tis always the same, and ever
will be.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="346"/>
TO bring it down to the Case in hand.
Virtue and Modesty were Things our Ancestors
had to value themselves upon in a particular
manner; and indeed they had a great Share of
them, such as they might justly value them∣selves
upon. Now we may boast, I hope, of Vir∣tue
and Honesty, in Quantity, as much as they,
and, I believe, we do talk as loudly of it as
ever they did; but whether our Virtue and our
Honesty are of as fine a Standard or not, I dare
not enter upon a nice enquiry into that Part,
for sundry good Reasons, not so fit perhaps to
mention, as we might wish they were.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES I am afraid there is a baser
Alloy among us, and that the Species is a little
altered (in these Ages of Mirth and good Feed∣ing);
I won't venture to say it is not so. But
even in the Particular before me, I have been told,
our Forefathers were stricter in their adhering to
the Laws of Nature than we think our selves
obliged to be; that they abhorred the Pollutions
that I complain of, and that they left us their
Posterity, much a founder and healthier Gene∣ration
for that very thing, perhaps, than we
may leave those that are to come after us.</P>
<P>IT is a very unhappy Case, that these Prac∣tices
should affect Posterity so much as they say
they do, because whether we consider it so
much as we might do or not; I cannot doubt
but our Children will be touch'd in their
Health and Constitution a little, if it be but
a little, by the corrupt Practices of this lewd
Age. What we bring upon our selves is no∣thing
but to our selves, and we might be apt
to say, we alone should suffer for it; and it
were well if it were no otherwise.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="347"/>
BUT to forfeit for our Posterity, to entail
Diseases upon the Blood of our Successors, to
send them into the World with aching Heads,
rheumatick Joints, entailed Diseases, inflamed
Blood, and affected Nerves, and cause them, <HI>as
we may say,</HI> to come WEEPING into the World,
and go GROANING out of it; this would give
a considering Mind a Pang of Remorse, and
make us anticipate our Children's Sorrows a
little, by fighing for them sometimes before
they are born.</P>
<P>LIFE at best brings Sorrows enough with it,
and we need not seem to be concerned left our
Children should not have their share of them;
they will bring Evils of that kind enough
(and fast enough too) upon themselves; we
have no need to send them into time with an
Inheritance of crippled Joints, and aching
Bones, and take care to give them cause to
curse their Fathers and Mothers, as many do
every Day.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but the Intemperance and
Excesses I have spoken of in this Chapter, have
sometimes descended from Line to Line to the
third and fourth Generation; and that many
of the Miseries of Life are owing to the in∣fected
Blood of those that went before them:
And let such People reflect seriously upon
the Number of Children born into the World
in this luxurious, intemperate vitious Age,
and in this City in particular, who die in the
very Infancy of their Life, who coming into
the World loaded with Distempers, the effect
of their Parents Intemperance and unnatu∣ral
Excesses, struggle a few Days with the un∣equal
Burthen of Life, and expire under the
Weight of it.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="348"/>
IT is but within a few Days that I have seen
Examples of this kind, in Families within the
reach of a little enquiry. One has four Chil∣dren
left out of twenty-four; another two out
of eighteen; another three out of twenty-two;
and so of many more; whereas <HI>T—C—,</HI> a
Man of Virtue and Temperance, within the
reach of my own Acquaintance, has had thir∣teen
Children, and never buried one; but at
ninety Years of Age sees them all grown Men
and Women, healthy, strong, fruitful, and full
of Children of their own.</P>
<P><HI>G—D—,</HI> another antient, grave, and re∣ligious
Gentleman, had but four Children, his
Wife dying young, and himself living single
afterwards to a great Age, saw those four, be∣ing
all Daughters, bring forth just eighty Chil∣dren,
and had at one time One hundred and
thirteen of his Children, Grand-Children and
Great Grand-Children, dining with him at his
Table.</P>
<P>THESE are some of the Examples of Tempe∣rance
and Modesty, which assist to a strong
Constitution, whose Vigour extended in the
Course of Nature, multiplies much more than
the Heats of an outrageous Flame, and leaves
a Tincture of Health and vigorous Spirits upon
their Posterity; whereas a tainted Soul, cor∣rupting
the Mass of Blood with Vice and
Lewdness, brings a Generation of diseased and
distempered Animals, fit to be sent to an Hos∣pital,
Cradle and all; and calling for Physici∣ans,
and the help of Art, even before they can
be fairly said to live.</P>
<P>IT is true, I do not place this all to the Ac∣count
of the two particular Branches of Intem∣perance
and Excess only, which are mentioned
<PB N="333" REF="349"/>
in this Chapter, but to the whole practice of
immodest and indedecent Actions, the product of
extravagant Desires, mentioned in the Chapters
foregoing; for being now at the close of the
Account, (and 'tis time I were, for it is a black
Account indeed) the Application refers to the
whole, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the general Immodesty of the Day,
as practised among married People, and pleaded
for, vindicated and defended, under the cover
and protection of the facred Office, and under
the pretence of being lawful, because within
the Bounds of Matrimony.</P>
<P>NOR do I pretend that I have yet gone
through all the Branches of this dirty Practice;
the Wickedness is dispersed among a vast vari∣ety
of Causes and Circumstances, as it is a∣mong
abundance of People; not a Back-door,
but the courrpt Blood, the Offspring of a cor∣rupt
Race sally out at, and which Way soever
you look, you may see daily new Indecencies,
not only acted but contrived, studied and found
out, in order to gratify the Vice, and lay us
open to the Scourage of the Satyr.</P>
<P>IT is time to combat an Evil that is thus
growing upon us, and that encroaches under the
Protection of so many specious and plausible
Outsides: One pleads Nature, another Law,
another Necessity, all of them Things that
have their additional Pretences as hard to an∣swer
as the Offenders pretend they are to re∣sist.
It is not easie to persuade them that
they offend; and if they seem to be convinced
that they do, 'tis yet with such Extenuations,
such Excuses, and such appararent Inclinations
to continue the Practice, that there is scarce
room to hope for any Amendment.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="350"/>
COU'D we but conquer the avow'd open de∣fending
these Practices, it would be a great
Point gain'd; Men would case to insist
upon the Justification of it, or to boast in the
Facts: Could we but persuade them not to pub∣lish
their own Shame, but to cease valuing
themselves upon what they ought to blush at,
this would give some room to hope for a Refor∣mation
of the Practice; we might promise our
selves, that what they were once ashamed of
they might perhaps, in time, think of reform∣ing;
at least, it wou'd be a Step towards it.
But how shall we suppose <HI>L</HI>—<HI>G</HI>—, of
—<HI>shire,</HI> Es{que} or his eminent Neighbour the
J—ce, should quit the Crimes which they
meet without fail twice a Week to contem∣plate
of, committing them over again in
Imagination, least they should not be guilty
enough, and forming and accumulated Guilt in
their Souls, a Guilt which few People are
wicked enough to understand, (<HI>viz.</HI>) once in
the Fact, and again in the Reflection; in∣stead
of Repentance, commiting the Crime
again in the Mind, by thinking it over with
Delight.</P>
<P>THESE are Proficients in the Art of Sin∣ning,
that knowing how to offend in the most
exquisite manner, are so far from Repentance,
that, if they have any regret at all, it is that
they know not how to be wickeder than they
are, but rejoyce over the Opportunities they
have, and wish for more.</P>
<P>RATHER than not be wicked, they will run
lawful Things up to a criminal Excess, and
make themselves Offenders when they need
not.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="351"/>
THIS is such a kind of pleasure in Crime, ssch
a fondness of doing Evil, that I am persuaded
the Devil does not come up to; the Devil does
not commit Sinas a pleasure, but with other and
farther Views, such as affronting GOD his supreme
Governor, and who he hates on innumerable Ac∣counts;
ruining Man, the subject of his Envy;
lessening the Authority of Heaven, and counter∣acting
divine Providence; and such other hel∣lish
Ends and Reasons, for which he exerts
himself in Crime to the utmost; and the Plea∣sure
the Devil takes in Crime is no otherwise,
but more or less, as it answers some of these
hellish Designs, and aims at more.</P>
<P>BUT my accurate Friend the 'Squire—,
pleases himself in the meer Crime, laughs in
the Satisfaction he finds in the very Enjoyment
of Vice; like a Man that would Blow up a
House, and the whole Family in it, for the
meer Satisfaction of hearing the Bounce; and
please himself with it afterward, upon the
meer Please of seeing the innocent Wife and
Children fly up in the Air, and be dash'd in
Pieces with the Fall.</P>
<P>THE Fact is not so bloody and cruel indeed,
but the Principle is the same; he that can look
back upon a hundred Adulteries, and act them
all over again in his Imagination, with the same
Pleasure as before, wishing for Occasions to
commit a hundred more. I appeal to the learned
Divines, who know what the meaning of that
Text is, <HI>has committed Adultery with her already
in his Heart,</HI> Matth. v. 28. whether such a Man
is not really, tho' not actually, guilty of three
hundred Adultreries, putting them all together.</P>
<P>IT is a particular Snare to these Men, in
the Case I am upon, that they say the Crime
<PB N="336" REF="352"/>
they are thus daily committing is no Crime,
much less Adultery, and that it has a Cover
for it, which they make their Refuge, and
under the Protection of which, they run out
into all these Extravagancies with a kind of
quietness and satisfaction upon their Soul, that
is not easily to be described; this Covering is
the Article of Marriage, the very Thing I am
upon, and 'tis upon this very Account that this
whole Book is written.</P>
<P>IT is under the Cover of Marriage, that these
Excesses and Immodesties are committed. But
under what Protection are they committed over
again with the Tongue, boasting and talking
lewdly of the Extravagancies they have com∣mitted?
Of which I have this double Charge to
lay against them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) In the first they sinn'd
with their Wives; in the second without their
Wives; nay, to carry it farther, in the first
they sinn'd against Heaven, in the second a∣gainst
the sacred Ordinance of Marriage, and a∣gainst
the Wife also.</P>
<P>AND not to leave them room to Cavil at the
Expression, I explain and insist upon it, that a
decent concealing the conjugal Freedoms be∣tween
a Man and his Wife, is a Debt due to
Modesty as a Virtue, and to the Wife as she is
a Woman. He that exposes those Things de∣serves
no more the Name of a rational Creature,
much less of a Man of Modesty, nay, hardly
of a Man. In a word, he Sins against his Wife,
and exposes himself, and the last most abomi∣nably.</P>
<P>NOR will his Marriage cover either of these
Crimes, but rather aggravate them, for, as I
said, he Sins against the very Marriage it self:
Marriage is a Contract of Liberty to lawful
<PB N="337" REF="353"/>
Things; but Marriage is no Protection for
Crime; Marriage covers the Bed undefiled,
and makes it pure and honourable. But the
Man may pollute even his Marriage-Bed, and
when he does so, he makes that criminal which
would otherwise be lawful.</P>
<P>THUS unnatural Crimes may be acted in the
Marriage-Bed; and will any Man say, it is no
Sin because it is under the Cover of Marriage;
the Woman may be ravish'd in the Marriage∣Bed,
and the Man deserve the Gallows for
Crimes offer'd to his own Wife. Let such con∣sider
of it, lest the Woman <HI>turn the Slipper up
against them,</HI> and least they be exposed as they
deserve.</P>
<P>AS Matrimony is no Protection for unnatu∣ral
Vices, so neither is it for indecent Excesses
and Immodesties; and as for the Pleasure they
take in the contemplation of what was crimi∣nal
in the committing, as it is doubling the
Offence, so it is with the addition of something
unnatural in it also. In a word, talking Lewd∣ly,
according to a known Author, is infamous,
but talking lewdly of conjugal Actions is un∣natural
and odious; 'tis a kind of a <HI>Sodomy</HI> of
the Tongue; 'tis a Crime that wants a Name,
but 'tis great pity it should want a Punishment.</P>

not equally criminal, yet every
Thing scandalous and offensive is
really Criminal, as that which
exceeds it in Degree; and there∣fore
the Article I am now upon,
though it may not be so odious singly, and in it

Whoredom as the past Heads I have
mentioned, yet it is Part of the Crime, and in
the Intent and Meaning, the Persons are as re∣ally
guilty as in any of the other.</P>
<P>EVERY thing comes within the Compass of
what I call Matrimonial Whoredom, wherein
the Marriage is made the meer Cover for a
wicked, ungoverned sensual Desire. Marriage
is the Result of a pure Flame; 'tis entring into
a sacred Relation with the Ends and Views
which conform to the immediate End and
Reason of the Institution it self.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="355"/>
As it is an Ordinance of GOD, its original
is Divine, the reason of it good, the nature of
it sacred; and it ought to be preserved in its
Purity, not debauched by the corrupt Inclina∣tions
of Men, and made a Tool to a vitious
ungoverned Appetite.</P>
<P>THIS is the Case when any Excursions are
made out of the ordinary Road of those two
obligatory Articles, which I mentioned at first,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) Decency and Modesty.</P>
<P>TO rush into Matrimony as a Horse rushes
into the Battle, intimates a Fury, not a ratio∣nal
sober Christian Proceeding; in a word, it
detects the Person of the Crime I have men∣tioned
so often, (<HI>viz.</HI>) a raging inflamed Appe∣tite;
let it lie ever so deep, covered with what∣soever
Pretences, guilded over however smooth
and shining, let the outside be as specious as
you will, the Poison is lodg'd within, the Ve∣nom
of it works in a secret manner, till it
breaks out in Scandal and Crime.</P>
<P>TAKE it in which Sex you will, the Offence
is the same; nor do I always yield that it is
worse in the Woman than in the Man; the
Crime is the same, and the Obligation to De∣cency
is equal; we may load the Woman the
harder, because we pretend Modesty is ever
peculiar, at least ought to be so, but I do not
grant it at all. Men indeed make the boldest
Sallies, and the Men have brought themselves
to a kind of allowing themselves in Crime by
the Authority of Custom; but I deny that in
the Original it ought to be so.</P>
<P>A Man ought no more to swear and be drunk,
quarrel and commit murther in his Rage than
a Woman; and the Offence is as great when
he does it. Custom only has given Crime
<PB N="340" REF="356"/>
a more odious Title, where the Woman is the
guilty Person, because it is not expected from
her so much. But is there any Law that shows
us, the Man has more indecent Liberties al∣lowed
him than the Woman? Not at all; the
Obligation is the same, and the Offence the
same.</P>
<P>ALL indecent Matrimony is mutual, and
the Crime is mutual, the Scandal affects both;
the Woman is as guilty as the Man, and the
Man as the Woman. Suppose, for example, a
Man having buried his Wife, goes the next
Week, or next Month, or next Day (for 'tis
much alike) to court another Woman. This is
not unlawful, that's true, but 'tis highly inde∣cent;
and where lies the Crime? In the Man,
says Custom, because he is the Aggressor: But
I deny that there is the least Difference in that
Part, for the Woman knows it, and she knows
'tis scandalous; Why then does she come into
it? The Crime is hers as much as his. Nay, if
a Breach of Modesty is greater in the Wo∣man
than in the Man, as some pretend, then
she is the greatest Offender here too, for the
Indecency on her Side is utterly inexcusable.</P>
<P>BUT a Question or two returns upon us
here: What is the Indecency that you should
bring it into the Rank of Matrimonial Whore∣dom,
or that the Woman should be charged
with it? The Indecency is a want of respect
to the Memory of the Dead, and pray what is
the Woman concerned in that? Perhaps she did
not so much as know her, or had ever seen her
in her Life; what then is the Memory of her
to her that comes after?</P>
<P>THE next Question is this, Breach of De∣cency
is an invasion of Custom only, and this
<PB N="341" REF="357"/>
Custom is a meer Thing of Nothing, an Origi∣nal
of no Authority. Matrimony as an Ordi∣nance
of GOD, and as sacred Institution, Cu∣stom
can have nothing to do with that; it is not
binding at all in Law, neither the Laws of GOD
or Man, and what have we to do with that? The
Man is single, and the Woman is dead; she is as
really dead as if she had been in her Grave se∣ven
Years; nor is there the least Injury or In∣justice
done to her; all the rest is a meer Ho∣mage
paid to Custom, and which is not at all
its due.</P>
<P>I give this the greater Length because 'tis a
popular Argument, and often brought to de∣fend
these sudden, hasty and indecent Marriages
I speak of; and likewife to let you see, that
though I should grant every Word of it, yet
my Objection against the Practice of such hasty
Marriages stands good, and the Reproach is the
same.</P>
<P>FOR, 1. My Objection is not so much a∣gainst
the Breach of a Custom, as it is against
a Breach of Modesty; and if Custom only has
made it so, for Custom or Crime made Modesty
a Virtue at first, yet since it is so we are
bound by it so far, as we are to do every thing
which is of good Report, to avoid every thing
that gives offence, and is an occasion of Re∣proach,
though it may in it self be literally
lawful.</P>
<P>2. BUT my Objection lies chiefly another
Way, and points at another thing; the hasty
and untimely, or unseasonable Marriages which
I complain of, and which, I say, are scandalous
and criminal, are so, as they discover them∣selves
to be the Effect of a raging, ungo∣verned
Appetite, a furious immodest Gust of
<PB N="342" REF="358"/>
Sensuality, a Flame of immoderate De∣sires.</P>
<P>AS these are Things which should be morti∣fied
and restrained, not indulged and gratified,
so every indecent untimely Step taken in pur∣suit
of this corrupt and vitiated Flame, is a
Crime; and therefore I think a Marriage found∣ed
upon this Foot is neither more or less than a
Matrimonial Whoredom, or at least a Degree of
it. 'Tis a criminal Gust, giving Beginning to a
scandalous and indecent Action, which by that
means becomes criminal too, though otherwife
literally lawful; that is, it becomes Matter of
Scandal, and gives offence to others, which is
what, by the Scripture Rule, Christians ought
industriously to avoid.</P>
<P>NOW when a Woman, within a Month or
two after her Husband's Death, shall receive
the Addresses of another, or a Man within such,
or sometimes a shorter Time, shall apply him∣self
to a Woman for Matrimony; can this be
supposed to be from a modest Foundation, or
within the compass of religious Regards? It
cannot be.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY, though it is not so regarded,
is really a religious, sacred and divine Institu∣tion;
it ought to be taken as such, and never
undertaken without Regard to its religious
Foundation: So far as it is made a stalking
Horse to a corrupt and baser Desire, so far as it
is made use of as a Pretence to cover the vitia∣ted
Appetite, give it what fine Words you
will, and guild it over with as many fair Out∣sides
as you will, 'tis so far turned into a Ma∣trimonial
Whoredom: The Vice is at the Bot∣tom,
the Matrimony is enter'd upon meerly to
gratify it, and to please the Appetite under
<PB N="343" REF="359"/>
the Cover of Liberty, and under the Plea of
Law.</P>
<P>IN a Word, all such Marriages, or such Mo∣tions
to Marriage, where the sensual Part is the
essential Part, are so far liable to this Charge;
when the Vice, I say, is the moving Cause,
and the Ceremony is the Tool to introduce and
colour it; that's what I call legal Wickedness;
when the Law of Matrimony is made a Key to
the Union of the Bodies more than of the Souls,
opening the Door to the insatiate Appetite,
and covering the Fire of Vice under the legal
Institution. This I call Matrimonial Whore∣dom,
and, I think, it merits the Name very
well.</P>
<P>MATRIMONY is a chast and modest Scheme
of Living; 'tis a State, not a Circumstance of
Life; the End and Meaning of it is the rais∣ing
Families, procreating Children, to be
brought up religiously; 'tis an Establishment
contracted, or at least ought to be so, as an
Appointment of Heaven; and for solid and
substantial Enjoyments; it is durable as Life,
and bounded only by the Duration of Life. If
it be enter'd into upon other Foundations, and
so far as it is so engaged in, so far 'tis abused
such are joined together indeed, but not ac∣cording
to GOD'S <HI>holy Ordinance;</HI> 'tis debauch∣ing
the Ordinance, corrupting the proposed
End; 'tis a good Means made use for a bad
End; and as 'tis pursued with wicked Designs,
'tis so far a wicked Engagement: Such do not
come together like Man and Wife, but like
W—and R—; in short, they come toge∣ther
to take their Fill of Crime, and that, made
a Crime by the Manner of it, tho' not in the
Letter of it.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="360"/>
As when a Set of Gentlemen make an Ap∣pointment
for what they call a Drinking-bout,
they make their Agreement to meet at such a
Tavern on purpose: “Tis certainly and literally
lawful for them to meet. Society, and even
Society for diversion, is lawful and good; but
this is a Meeting meerly to be drunk, meerly
to satisfy the Appetite or Thirst of Wine, and
with an Intention, nay, with a resolved Pur∣pose
of being Drunk; and what is to be said
then of the Meeting it self? It was a Wicked∣ness
in it self; 'twas a purpose to gratify a
vitious Appetite; and so far the very Meeting
it self was a Crime; 'twas an Act of Debauch∣ery;
'twas founded on a thirst of Wine, and a
Thirst not to be quenched but by Excess and
Intemperance.</P>
<P>THE Parallel is exactly just, the Matrimony
contracted in the manner I speak of is just
the same; 'tis founded in Crime, the sensual
Part is the Foundation and Original of it; and
the Matrimony is only the help, the conveni∣ence
to bring it to pass lawfully, as two re∣solving
to go over a River to commit a Theft;
the pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the River, and the Robbery, is the
Intent; the Ferry-Boat is only the lawful A∣sistant
to an unlawful Purpose.</P>
<P>BUT neither is this all, for it is criminal to
abuse the Ordinance, to turn the sacred Ap∣pointment
of Heaven to a corrupt and vile
Use, making it the assistant to Sensuality, and
to gratifying the Flesh, to quenching a disho∣nourable
Flame, which was very far from the
meaning or design of the Institution. That
was all pure and upright, singly and simply,
honest and clean in every Part and Branch
of it, and cannot without a Crime be
<PB N="345" REF="361"/>
turned, and applied to gratify unchast De∣sires.</P>
<P>IT is greatly wanted that our Governours
and constituted Powers should take notice of
such Things, and, as far as lies in them, pre∣vent
the turning and inverting the End of
these nice Institutions, that they may not be
apply'd to wrong Purposes, or debauched by
Men of vitious Inclinations, to such Ends as
are scandalous to Religion, and to humane So∣ciety.</P>
<P>'TIS true, it would be hard to make a Re∣gulation
which should suit to every Cir∣cumstance
which might happen, and to the
nature of the Thing too; yet something might
be done; for Example, I think there might be
a Law made which should limit the Rule of
Decency in the Case of second Marriages, bind∣ing
the Parties surviving to a certain Time, in
which it should not be lawful for the Man or
the Woman to marry after the Death of the
Wife or Husband that went before; and if any
did marry within that Time, it should be e∣steemed
not only unlawful but shameful and
odious, done in meer sensuality, and to gratify
the worst Part, not the Christian Part; it
should, in short, be a Brand of Infamy on the
Person, whether Man or Woman, either to
marry, or even to treat of, or about Marriage,
within that Time.</P>
<P>SUCH a Law would, at least, distinguish
People one from another; they would be known
and mark'd out; and if that Law was duly
and exactly executed, the Offence would, in
time, grow out of use, be really scandalous,
no Body would be guilty of it that had
<PB N="346" REF="362"/>
any Value for their own Character, because it
would expose the Crime, as well as the Fact.</P>
<P>I grant, that the Respect to the Dead is not
the thing that makes the Crime, but that Re∣spect
being a Debt of Decency, why is it not
paid? Let the Reason be enquired into, the
Answer must be natural, because the Party has
a secret Inclination to gratify, and which is to
be obliged in spight of that Pretence. Now all
Matrimony that is meerly enter'd into to gra∣tisy
the Inclination, that is undertaken meer∣ly
for the sensual Part, is, in my Sense, a
debauched Matrimony, because Sensuality is
not the true End and Design of the Ordinance
of Matrimony, but a Corruption of it, and an
Abuse.</P>
<P>IT is for the Honour of Matrimony, and to
dignify the Ordinance in a due Manner, that
those Things should be avoided which bring
Scandal upon it, tho' it be but in the Circum∣stances,
not the essential Part: To see a Couple
come together meerly and openly to gratify
the vitious and Brutal Part, and satisfy their
Sensuality, and then take the sacred Name of
GOD in their Mouths, and tell us, they do
come together <HI>according</HI> tO GOD <HI>'S holy Ordi∣nance.</HI>
This is making, not a Jest of Religion
only, but 'tis Prophaneness, 'tis turning sacred
Things to debauched Purposes, 'tis giving reli∣gious
Titles to corrupt Undertakings, and san
ctifying Crimes by the Mask of Innocence.</P>
<P>LET Protestants and Christians, or those who
would be esteemed such, look back upon the
Purity which they profess, and no longer study
to cover and conceal Crime under the Appear∣ance
of Religion, but honestly explode the vi∣tious
Part, and distinguish rightly between
<PB N="347" REF="363"/>
Things sincere, and Things shameful and hy∣pocritical.</P>
<P>WHERE Matrimony is pretended, let it be
as it ought to be, according to its Institution, <HI>ac∣cording
to</HI> GOD's <HI>holy Ordinance;</HI> and as after
joining Christians are still bound by the Laws
of Decency and Modesty, let their coming to∣gether
be so too; let it be without the Reproach
of Crime, without the Brand of Indecent and
Immodest, which are the Offspring of a most
infamous Principle. They that fix the Blame
upon themselves thus at first, may depend that
the Brand of it, like burning in the Hand, will
be <HI>Indelible,</HI> the Blot never wears out; what∣ever
their Characters are afterward, the History
is told with this Hesitation, <HI>But He</HI> or <HI>But She</HI>
did <HI>so or so,</HI> married in a most scandalous Way,
immediately after the Death of the former
Wife or Husband; and with this Reproach
they must be content to go on to their
Graves.</P>
<P>HOW easily may People avoid these Re∣proaches?
And how much is it every Christian
Man's Duty to avoid them, if possible? A little
mortifying of the Flesh, <HI>with its Affections and
Lusts,</HI> would do it, especially as to the reli∣gious
Part; a little Prudence in restraining
their Inclination; a little Government of the
corrupt Flame; a little Concern for Reputa∣tion,
for Character, and for the Honour of
Posterity, would smooth the Way; that's the
civil Part.</P>
<P>BUT wretched Conduct! How are all these
Things laugh'd at? How are all the Obligations
of Decency and Modesty forgot? When the
Vice prompts, when the sensual Part stirs, the
Voice of Reason is drown'd and still'd by the
<PB N="348" REF="364"/>
Clamour of the Senses; Nature rebels against
Principle, Vice gets the better of Virtue, and
the wicked Appetite sinks all the Resolutions
of Abstinence and Moderation.</P>
<P>AND what is all this Scandal heap'd up for?
How mean, how sordid a Thing, if it be con∣sider'd,
abstracted from that specious Pretence?
And what is the Difference betwixt this and
Whoring, if there was not this Refuge of a
scandalous Marriage? Would such Men scruple
quenching the Flame a more irregular Way?
How long would Virtue restrain them, if Mo∣desty
and Decency will not? How long will
they be afraid of Crime, that are not afraid
of Scandal?</P>
<P>THE Man, outrageous in his Appetite,
must have a Relief, his sensual Part teazes and
importunes him: How long would he hold out
against it, if there was not this Relief under
the Colour of Law? As if the Letter of the
Law would defend him, where the Essence, the
intent and meaning of the Law is against
him.</P>
<P>I can never hope for such a Man, that he
would restrain himself for fear of the Sin, who
will not for fear of the Scandal; especially
where the Scandal brings Crime along with it
too: 'Tis a Crime upon himself; 'tis a Sin a∣gainst
himself, against his Fame, and against
his Family and Posterity; it lays an indelible
Blot upon them, and he Brands himself with
such a Mark of Infamy, that not only his Chil∣dren
after him shall bear a Share of, but such as
his Children themselves shall reproach him with
in their Turn, and when 'twill be too late for
him to Blush, if it should not be too late for
him to Repent of it.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="365"/>
NOTHING that I know of, at least nothing
of the Kind, can be a worse Blot upon the
Character of a Christian, than this of an un∣bounded,
ungoverned Sensuality, and of doing
scandalous Things from such a vile Principle.
The Man himself, or the Woman either, will
be as much ashamed of it, and as much re∣proach
themselves afterwards as any Body else,
unless the Crime it self hardens them against
Shame.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN—<HI>H</HI>—, was a noted Offender
of this kind, he was a Commander of a good
Ship, and his Name is now a standing Prece∣dent,
both of the Crime I am speaking of, and
the Penitence; he buried a virtuous, sober,
beautiful Wife, and with a Face of uncon∣cerned
Levity, looks immediately round him
for another, even before his first Wife was bu∣ried.
As the Thought was surprizing and im∣pudent,
so he could not expect any Woman of
Modesty would talk with him upon that Sub∣ject;
and as he found he was abhorr'd and
scorn'd upon the very mention of it, he seeks
out where he thought he should not be refused;
and that Way he answered his wicked Design
immediately; for he married in two Days after
his Wife was buried.</P>
<P>IN an ill Hour, pursuing his vitious Appe∣tite,
he singles out a Woman, <HI>Fool as I was,</HI>
(said he afterwards). What need I have ask'd
her to marry? If it had been t'other Question,
I need not have fear'd a Denial.</P>
<P>IN a word, he marry'd her, lov'd her, lay
with her, and hated her, and all within the
compass of a Fortnight; in another Fortnight
he went to Sea and left her, and in two Months
more, was cast away, drown'd, and saw her no
<PB N="350" REF="366"/>
more; and the Woman marry'd again the next
Day after she heard of it.</P>
<P>THE Man was always (before this Step) lov'd
and esteem'd among his Friends; he pass'd till
that time for a Man of Virtue and Sobriety;
and, had he thought fit to have subdued his
vitious Appetite but one Year, or perhaps half
a Year, he had preserved that Character, and
might have had his Choice of a Wife among
the Ladies in his Neighbourhood; very few
would have refusd him. And this he acknow∣ledged
in the hearing of the Person from whom
I had the Relation.</P>
<P>BUT overjoy'd with the Liberty he had up∣on
the change of his Circumstances; quitting a
sick Companion, and left to range the World
for another, he sacrificed his Fame to his Sen∣suality,
and could not prevail with himself to
stay, no not a Week; which Precipitation
made him the scorn of all about him; and, as
I said, in less than a Month he could have hang'd
himself with the same satisfaction, compar'd
to what he had in the preposterous Step he had
taken: But it was too late to look back; he
could never retrieve it. He was indeed a Peni∣tent,
as to the Folly of it; and own'd to me
personally, that it was nothing but meer Ma∣trimonial
Whoredom. I use his own Words;
and it was the very first Case that put the Pur∣pose
of reproving it in this manner, into my
Thoughts.</P>
<P>THE Tragedy of this poor Gentleman was
enough to fill any Man's Mind with a just In∣dignation
at the Practice; and though we see
it often done, where perhaps the Consequence is
not so fatal, yet the particular Scandal of it is
not at all lessen'd: Had he not found that fa∣vourable
<PB N="351" REF="367"/>
Passage out of Life, whether in Judg∣ment
or in Mercy, GOD alone knows, I know
not what might have been his Fate; for it was
such a mortification to him to see himself so
universally despis'd upon this scandalous Occa∣sion,
and, as he himself said, to deserve it too;
whereas he was, on the contrary, so generally be∣loved
before, that it was more than all the Phi∣losophy
he was Master of could support.</P>
<P>HE was indeed a <HI>Memento</HI> to his Friends,
and a Warning against Matrimonial Whore∣dom
to all that knew him. I say nothing of
the Creature he took; she is below our Consi∣deration
in the Case, because she had no Cha∣racter,
no Virtue to expose.</P>
<P>ALL the Argument this unfortunate Person
had to excuse himself was, that he was loth to
go to a Whore; but he was horribly asham'd to
mention it; nor did he speak so but to his very
intimate Friends, of whom I was one. But he
repented heartily of that Caution, and own'd
to us, that he believ'd his Sin was as great, and
especially, as he said, the Scandal was greater.
Nor did he think himself less guilty of Whore∣dom
for the formality of the Marriage; and I
am to acknowledge that it was from this Man,
and from his Penitentials, that, as above, I had
the very Words which I make the Title of this
Work, and which I have on so many Occasions
repeated, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Matrimonial Whoredom.</P>
<P>FROM this sad History in a Man, whom I e∣steemed
as a Man of Worth, and for that Rea∣son
esteemed his Story as considerable, I might
proceed to give flagrant Examples of the like
scandalous Matches, and from the like unjusti∣fiable
Principle, but without the like penitent
<PB N="352" REF="368"/>
Acknowledgment; such is the famous <HI>B</HI>—
<HI>B</HI>—, of wanton Fame, who married five
Husbands in less than four Years; and impu∣dently
declares, she resolves never to stay above
a Fortnight unmarry'd at a time. But these
Examples are too mean for our mention; the
telling a scandalous Story of a scandalous Per∣son
is no Novelty, there's no Instruction in it,
nothing else is to be expected. But the prac∣tice
of such things where Men pretend to un∣derstand
themselves, to have a Sense of Repu∣tation,
of Virtue, Prudence, and, above all, of
Religion; this indeed has something wonder∣ful
in it, and is worth recording.</P>
<P>ANOTHER scandalous Piece of Matrimonial
Whoredom, and which I call untimely Marri∣ages,
is that of marrying Infants and Persons
not of Ages fit for Marriage, or, as we say, not
marriageable. This has something extreamly
shocking and surfeiting in it, and, indeed, will
less bear a repetition, than any thing we have
spoken of yet; and I am harder put to it to
express the just Detestation of it, especially in
the Cases which represent themselves on the
Particular before me, because the Particulars,
and the Motives of them, can hardly be mo∣destly
mentioned.</P>
<P><HI>J—M</HI>—, liv'd not twenty Miles off of
<HI>Highgate,</HI> he had two young Ladies in his
House, and who were bred up by him, or under
him, his own Daughter, and a little Cousin his
Child's Play-fellow; his Wife died, that was the
first opening to his Wickedness; they were
both young, his Daughter about eleven Years
old, the Cousin between eleven and twelve,
from his little Cousins, being his Daughter's
Play-fellow, he wants to make her his own,
<PB N="353" REF="369"/>
and, in about two Years, made himself so fami∣liar
with her, (to describe it no nearer) that he
divested her of all Modesty also; but that he
might not make it a Piece of Debauchery, as
he called it, he gets a profligate Parson, and
marries the Girl, himself upwards of Forty,
and the Child a little above Thirteen, which he
alledged was a marriageable Age, and before
she was Fourteen she was with Child by him.
Whether she died in Child-bed or no, I do not
remember; but this I have heard for Truth,
that a few Years after he was under Prosecu∣tion,
or at last fled the Country for a more
criminal Conversation with the t'other Child,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) his own Daughter, when, to palliate the
Matter, he would have marry'd her too; but
the Design was happily prevented. I hope no
Body would deny, but that whatever the first
was, the last was not Matrimonial Whoredom
only, but Matrimonial Incest.</P>
<P>IT is true, the last is a superlative in Wick∣edness,
and is needful to our Case; but the
first I take to merit very justly the Title of
Matrimonial Whoredom, and to come within
the reach of my Text.</P>
<P>I could give a Counter-example to this in a
Woman upwards of Forty, who, having bred
up a Youth almost in Charity in her Family,
and being her self left a Widow, married the
little Boy, so I call him, and did it with Cir∣cumstances
scandalous enough: The Particulars
indeed I have not at large, but at his Thir∣teenth
Year she married him, and before he was
Fifteen Years old, had a Child by him, and
after that three more.</P>
<P>I cannot enter into the Detail of her Story,
no not so much as I have had an Account of,
<PB N="354" REF="370"/>
'tis too foul; I have indeed no Words for it;
the <HI>English</HI> Language is not able to cover such
dirty Work, so I must leave it, as I am forced
to do several others; but you may depend up∣on
it, if there is such a thing in Nature as that
I call Matrimonial Whoredom; it was here in
its highest Extent, and in the extreme of Inde∣cency
and Immodesty.</P>
<P>IT is true, these ought to have belonged to
the Chapter of <HI>Marriages in unsuitable Years;</HI>
but I rather place them here, because I treat
these particular Articles as really criminal in
themselves, and in the Nature of them; the
other might be unhappy, occasioned by the
unsuitable Circumstances; but these were, as I
say, criminal; as <HI>Job</HI> says, they ought to have
been punished by the Judge, they stink in the
Nostrils of all modest People, and are hateful
and odious in the Sight both of GOD and Man.</P>
<P>TO bring it to the Case in hand: Here was
the Essence of Matrimonial Whoredom; the
meer incentive to this Marriage must be the
wicked Part, the satisfying the Brutal sensual
Appetite. What can it be less? The Office of
Matrimony was made but the Introduction, I
had almost said the Usher, to the Whoredom;
only that indeed the Matrimony is a passive
Circumstance, not a voluntary Act; in a word,
Matrimony is abused, and brought into it un∣justly;
and therefore, I think, they are right
in foreign Countries, where, in such Cases, the
Persons are liable to Punishment, not for the
vitious Part only, which it is hard to come at
there, as well as here; but they are liable, I say,
to Punishment, for abusing the holy Sacrament,
so they call Matrimony, and making it to be a
Tool to hand them on to commit the Crime;
<PB N="355" REF="371"/>
this they call Insulting the Church, and, in∣deed,
so I think it is; and they have their
Ecclesiastick Constitutions, by which it is pu∣nishable,
and the Priest is punished also that of∣ficiates
in such a Marriage.</P>
<P>BUT to quit this nauseous Part as soon as
we can; untimely Marriages are certainly
scandalous in their Nature, especially where
the Age is unequal, where one, being young,
and scarce Ripe, by the ordinary Course of
Nature, for the Marriage Bed, the other is of
full Age; 'tis not a Matrimonial Whoredom
only; 'tis, in my Opinion, a kind of a Matri∣monial
Rape, because it has something of Vio∣lence
offered to Nature in it on one Side, and
something odiously and criminally Immodest,
on the other.</P>
<P>IT is true, and 'tis objected against me here,
that in other Countries it is ordinary for the
Children, especially of great Families, to come
together young, and they have a usual Saying,
that like Fruit gathered green, and laid up,
they will ripen together; upon this Foot
they frequently marry very early, the Ladies at
eleven to twelve, and the Gentlemen at thir∣teen
or fourteen; and, as it is the practice of
the Country, there's no Scandal in it.</P>
<P>I have little to say to this Practice abroad; I
know it is so in <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> and some
other Places in the World; and there may be
natural Reasons to be given in justification of
the Practice; some taken from the Constitution
of the People, some from the Climate, some
from one Cause, some from another. Natura∣lists
can say more to it than is needful here.
Man and Woman have a Vegetative, as well as
a sensitive and rational Life; and there may
<PB N="356" REF="372"/>
be a physical Reason given why Nature may
be riper in one Part of the World than in
another, and in some People sooner than in
others; as it is evident the Season for the pro∣duction
of the same Fruits differ in one Place;
and in one Country from another, the Vintage
and the Corn-harvest, differ in one Country
from another; here they gather in <HI>August,</HI>
there in <HI>October;</HI> and it may be the like in
other Things, and in Men and Women, as well
as in other Creatures, for, <HI>as I said,</HI> the vege∣tative
Life obeys the Law of Nature in them,
as well as in Plants and Trees.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis enough that this is not the Custom
in our Country, neither, perhaps, has Nature
prepared Things to have it be so; and though
sometimes we may see Exceptions here too, and
Contracts may be made sooner, yet at sooncst
the Lady should be fourteen to fifteen, and the
Gentleman sixteen to seventeen, and even this
would be thought very soon too.</P>
<P>I know, as above, it may be otherwise some∣times;
but it is not looked upon as Modest or
Decent. I hear of an Instance at this time of a
young Lady that is big with Child, at a little
above thirteen. But 'tis ill thought on; 'tis
made a Jest of; 'tis call'd a Child with Child;
the Mother of the Girl is look'd awry upon,
and spoken ill of, for suffering it; the young
Thing, is looked at as People look at a Sight or
Show, and as something monstrous.</P>
<P>BUT what is this to the Case in hand, where
the Couple is equal, the Matter is the less; and
if there be a Fault any where, it seems to lie
upon the Parents, or the Guardians, or whoever
had the Conduct of the young People. But
this does not relate to the Case that I am up∣on;
<PB N="357" REF="373"/>
the two wretched Examples I have given,
and which were both within the narrow Com∣pass
of my own Knowledge, are not at all justi∣fied
by the practice of other Nations; we are,
as Christians, to be bound by the Laws of Do∣cency
and Modesty, and, as Subjects of a just
Government, by the Laws practis'd and receiv'd
in our own Country. It is the Custom in some
Nations to go naked, and in others they cloath
so light, that it is, as we say, next Door to go∣ing
naked; their Cloaths being so thin and light,
that all the Parts of the Body are, as it were,
described to the Eye, by the Garments setting
so close to them; as in <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Bar∣bary,</HI>
and other hot Countries: But such a Prac∣tice,
though 'tis thought nothing of there,
would be thought immodest here to the last
Degree, and indeed scandalous; and Christians
are to cleave so far to the Custom of the
Place, as to do all Things that are of good
Report.</P>
<P>BUT I return to the Case of untimely Mar∣riages,
and I shall closse it with a Story which I
have very good Authority for the Truth of,
where, though I cannot say there was any
thing of Immodesty in the Design or Intention,
nor any thing Immodest practis'd, or intended
to be practis'd, yet Heaven seem'd to make it
an Unhappiness to the Party, at least it was a
surprizing Disappointment.</P>
<P>A certain antient Widow, having a tolerable
good Estate, but no Children, and being up∣wards
of sixty Years of Age, had fixed her
Thoughts upon two young Women, which were
her Relations (Nieces I think) to leave what E∣state
she had to and which, divided between the
two, would have made them tolerable good For∣tunes.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="374"/>
AS she intended them this good Luck, so 'tis
likely she gave them some tolerable Additions
while she was alive, as to their Education, and
perhaps to their Equipage.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the foolish young Girls, suppo∣sing
their Aunt had no Body else to give her
Estate to, and not perhaps sensible of the Kind∣ness
shew'd them, at least not so sensible of it
as they ought to have been, carry'd it but
very indifferently to the old Lady; not only
slighting her, and neglecting her on many Oc∣casion,
but sometimes took upon them to be
saucy to her; and, in a word, at length they
too plainly discovered that they looked upon
the Estate to be, as it were, their right, and
as if the old Lady lived too long for them;
they would be frequently talking to one ano∣ther,
or to others, what they would do, and
how they would live when they came to the
Estate, if the old Woman was but out of the
Way.</P>
<P>EITHER some officious People, perhaps Ser∣vants,
had spite enough to report this to the
old Lady, or the Nieces had the Indiscretion to
let her hear some of it; the latter not very
unlikely; or she gathered from the whole Te∣nour
of their Conduct, that they slighted her;
that they only waited the good Hour, that
what little Respect they shew'd her, was evi∣dently
for what they were to get by her,
and no otherwise, and that they waited with
impatience when she would be pleased to walk
off: all which was indeed true in Fact.</P>
<P>AFTER the old Lady had thus taken
notice of their Conduct some time, she once
took Occasion more particularly to let them
know it: She told them what she had observed,
<PB N="359" REF="375"/>
how unkindly they treated her, how perfectly
at liberty she was to give her Estate to whom
she pleased, and that she was not so old, and
come to doat so much, as to give what she had
to those that did not think it worth their while
to deserve it, or that could not afford to be Civil
to her; that she found they only gap'd for her
Death, and that she should take care, if they
did not alter their Conduct, they should have
little enough to expect from her.</P>
<P>THIS alarm'd them a little; and if they had
been any thing but thoughtless Girls, they
would have chang'd their Methods a little. But
it wore off in a little time, and they went on
just as they did before.</P>
<P>AT length the old Lady, thoroughly provok∣ed
by their ill Usage, and her Resentment be∣ing
quickened by some particular extraordinary
Carriage, takes a sudden Resolution to change
her way of living, leave off House-keeping,
and retire into the Country, to end her Days, as
she called it, in Peace, and do good with what
she had.</P>
<P>HER Nieces soon found they had lost them∣selves
so much with her, that they had
not Interest enough to alter her Resolutions,
though they hung about her then with Tears
and Entreaties, so they employ'd other Rela∣tions
to intercede with her. But she soon
stopt their Mouths, with letting them know
how her Nieces had treated her, and what fair
Warning she had given them, adding some par∣ticular
Unkindnesses which she had met with
from them, and some Speeches which they had
been weak enough to let her overhear; upon
which to give away her Estate to charitable Uses, or
<PB N="360" REF="376"/>
otherwise to dispose of it, so that they should
never be at all better for it; and that it
was too late now to persuade her, for she was
fixed in her Measures; and the Reasons being
such as could not be answered, her Neices had
nothing to do but to consider of some other
Ways to maintain themselves, for she had no
more to say to them.</P>
<P>THIS was dismal News to the two Girls;
but they had no Remedy, so they shifted as
they could; we have no more to say about
them.</P>
<P>THE old Lady, according to her Resolution,
as above, put off her House, and went into the
Country where her Estate lay, and dwelt with
one of her Tenants in the Country; here she
liv'd perfectly retir'd, and attended only with
one Servant; and by this Time she was about
sixty-five Years old, but of a sound, hail Con∣stitution,
a chearful, easy Disposition, calm
Temper, and all the happy Tokens of long Life.</P>
<P>IT happened one Day, talking seriously with
her tenant, a good honest plain Man, but a
Man of Sense, and particularly of abundance
of religious Knowledge, she made her Com∣plaint
to him, how unkindly she had been
treated by her Nieces, and how she had resented
it, and was resolved, as above, that none of
them should be the better for her.</P>
<P>THE good Man exhorted and persuaded her
to forgive the young Women, to consider they
were young and gay, and wanted Discretion,
and that, no doubt, they would carry it other∣wise
to her now, if she would receive them a∣gain;
he added the Command of our Saviour,
<HI>to forgive Enemies, and our offending Brother;</HI>
and so pleaded often with her for the two poor
<PB N="361" REF="377"/>
Cast-off Girls. But he found the old Lady in∣flexible;
she had taken Things so ill that she
could not go back; she would forgive them, she
said, and pray for them, but she would never
give her Estate to them; that she said she was
not bound to do upon any Account whatever.
In a word, the good Man found there was no
room to say any thing farther upon that Sub∣ject,
unless he would utterly disoblige her,
which it was not his Business to do; so he
meddled no more with it.</P>
<P>AFTER some time, the old Lady tells her
Tenant, she wanted to speak with him, and his
Wife and Daughter together; the Daughther
was, it seems, a young married Woman, but a
sober, grave and religious Body, like her Fa∣ther;
and also of a Judgment above her Years;
and this, it seems, made the old Lady take her
into the Council; the Tenant had also a Son,
but he was but a little Boy of about nine or
ten Years old.</P>
<P>AT this Meeting the old Lady tells them,
that as she was now in Years, and could not
expect to live much longer, she thought
it was time to settle her Affairs in the World,
and to dispose of what Estate she had to leave
behind her; that they all know how she had
been treated by those to whom she had been
so kind, and to whom she had purposed to be
still so much kinder; That they likewise knew
what her Resolutions were with respect to
that; that at his Importunity however, she
had so far forgiven them, as to resolve to give
each of them a Legacy of One hundred Pounds
to help to support them, and to testify her
Charity, notwithstanding the ill Usage they
<PB N="362" REF="378"/>
had been pleased to give her; but that now
it was time for her to settle the rest.</P>
<P>AFTER this Discourse, she told them, that
she had been studying all poslible Ways how
she might dispose of the Estate most to her
satisfaction; and that, upon the whole, she
was resolved to marry. The Tenant, a grave,
and, as I said, good Man, seem'd to be greatly
distasted at that kind of Proposal for settling
her Estate, and the Tenant's Wife and Daugh∣ter,
both began to discover their surprize at it,
and a kind of nauseating the Proposal.</P>
<P>BUT hold, says she, hear what I have far∣ther
to say before you give your Opinion. My
Proposal of marrying shall have no Scandal in
it, I'll promise you; I shall leave no room for
Reproach; and you will say so, when you hear
who I have pitch'd upon for my Husband. In
short, there is a little Boy in your Town whom
I have chosen for a Husband, and upon whom
I will settle my Estate; and he is so young,
that no Body can raise any Objection against
it; for, to be sure, I shall be in my Grave be∣fore
he will be grown up to Man's Estate; and,
giving them no time to answer, she added, this
little Boy is your Son. I think, says she, you
say he is not above nine or ten Years old, and
I am almost seventy; and, if you give your
Consent, I'll put him to School; and after that,
if I should live so long, I'll put him to 'Prentice
at <HI>London</HI> to a good Trade, and give One hun∣dred
Pounds with him, and, to be sure, I shall
be dead before he will be out of his Time; and
then, selling Part of the Estate, he will have a
good Stock to set up with, and the remainder
will make a good Jointure for a Wife.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="379"/>
THE Tenant was strangely surprized with
the Proposal, and indeed was embarass'd with it.
As for the Women, they were quite silenc'd.
But the good Man told her, that indeed the
Proposal she had made of marrying a Child,
would take away all the Scandal which he was
before concerned about on her Account; but
that it would be a sad Blow to her own Rela∣tions;
and tho' he knew not what to say as to
his Child, whom he would be very tender of
hurting, seeing she had such kind Thoughts a∣bout
him, as to Design him her Estate, yet he
could not still but beg of her to consider very
well before she Disinherited her two Nieces,
and, at least, to do something more for them.
But, in short, she was immoveable as to that
Part; and, after some other Difficulties which
the old Tenant started, for he did not seem to
come very willingly into it, no not to the last,
it was however agreed on, and she was married
to the Boy.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to her Proposal, she put him
to School, and had him made a very good
Scholar; and she liv'd not only to see him
come home from the School, but to be big e∣nough
to go 'Prentice, and also to see him come
out of his Time; by which time he was about
twenty-two Years of Age.</P>
<P>BUT, as I said, even this unsuitable Match
did not prove so satisfactory as might have been
expected; for it pleased GOD this Woman liv'd
to such a prodigious Age, that the little Boy
was seventy-two Years of Age when he follow'd
her to the Church to bury her, and she was One
hundred twenty-seven Years old.</P>
<P>THIS Story I had attested to me by a Person
of an unquestion'd Veracity, who told me, he
<PB N="364" REF="380"/>
was himself at her Funeral: She was sixty-five
when she marry'd him, and liv'd sixty-two
Years with him; she indeed made him some
Amends for the disparity of Years by this,
that she was a most excellent Person, of an ini∣mitable
Disposition, preserv'd the Youth of her
Temper, and the Strength of her Understand∣ing,
Memory and Eye-sight to the last; and,
which was particularly remarkable, she bred a
whole new Set of Teeth, as white as Ivory, and
as even as a Youth, after she was ninety Years
old.</P>
<P>HERE was a Disparity, 'tis true; but here
was none of the corrupt Part, which I have
made the Mark of my Reproof, and so justly
too. Here was no Vice, no sensual Part, to be
so much as thought of; and yet, I say, it could
not but be a disappointment to the young Man;
and she would often complain to him of the
Injury she did him in living so long. But I
did not hear that it gave him any Uneasiness;
her extraodinary good Temper making him
so much amends for it.</P>
<P>THERE is a Custom of marrying Children
one to another by the Compact of their Parents,
while the said Children are very young; as has
been the Practice abroad, and as we had lately
an Example of in the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Courts,
tho' not very encouraging neither by its Suc∣cess,
or fitted much for an Example.</P>
<P>THIS has its Inconveniencies in it on many
Accounts; but as they do not come within the
reach of the criminal Part, I do not say they
are concerned in the Reproof of this Satyr;
nor am I speaking of such.</P>
<P>BUT since I am taking notice of the various
Sorts of untimely Marriages, and I have men∣tioned
<PB N="365" REF="381"/>
this; I should do Justice to the Practice
of our own Country in those Cases, namely,
that in such Compacts of Parents they are ge∣nerally
made thus, upon Condition that the
young People like one another when they are
grown up, and fit to come together.</P>
<P>THIS has both Reason and Religion in it,
and seems to be founded upon the great Prin∣ciple
of Liberty, both Civil and Ecclesiastick,
which this Nation are happy in the Enjoyment
of.</P>
<P>INDEED, it seems a kind of Tyranny over
our Children, which we have no Power to ex∣ercise,
to anticipate their Affections, and oblige
them in their Infancy to take up with an Ob∣ject
they have no liking to, and bind them
down here or there before-hand. I will not say,
but it may indeed be a kind of bespeaking their
Dislike from the natural Aversion which Men
commonly have to every Thing which is im∣posed
upon them, and to that irksome Thing
call'd, <HI>Being Imposed upon.</HI></P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is with a great deal of Reason
and Justice, that our Laws have
made stealing of Ladies criminal;
I mean a Capital Criminal; It
seemed a little hard, that a Gentle∣man
might have the satisfaction of hanging a
Thief that stole an old Horse from him, but
could have no Justice against a Rogue for steal∣ing
his Daughter.</P>
<P>THE Arts and Tricks made use of to Trapan,
and, as it were, Kidnap young Women away
into the Hands of Brutes and Sharpers, were
very scandalous, and it became almost dange∣rous
for any one to leave a Fortune to the dis∣posal
of the Person that was to enjoy it, and
where it was so left, the young Lady went al∣ways
in Danger of her Life, she was watch'd,
laid in wait for, and, as it were, besieged by
a continual Gang of Rogues, Cheats, Game∣sters,
and such like starving Crew, so that she
was obliged to confine her self like a Prisoner
to her Chamber, be lock'd, and barr'd, and
bolted in, and have her Eyes every Moment
upon the Door, as if she was afraid of Bayliffs
and Officers to arrest her; or else she was
snatch'd up, seized upon, hurry'd up into a
<PB N="367" REF="383"/>
Coach and fix, a Fellow dress'd up in a Clergy∣man's
Habit to perform the Ceremony, and a
Pistol clapt to her Breast to make her consent
to be marry'd: And thus the Work was done.
She was then carry'd to the private Lodging,
put to Bed under the same awe of Swords and
Pistols; a Fellow that she never saw in her Life,
and knows nothing of, comes to Bed to her,
deflowers her, or, as may be well said, ravishes
her, and the next Day she is called a Wife, and
the Fortune seized upon in the Name of the
Husband; and perhaps, in a few Days more,
play'd all away at the Box and the Dice, and
the Lady sent home again naked, and a Beg∣gar.</P>
<P>THIS was the Case within the Times of our
Memory, till the Parliament thought fit to
make it Felony, and that without Benesit of
Clergy, and till some of these Fortune Ravish∣ers
have since that paid for their Success at the
Gallows. And now, indeed, the Ladies are a
little safer, and must be attempted with a little
more Art, not taken by Storm, Sword in hand,
as Men take fortified Towns; but they must
be brought to give a formal Assent by the cun∣ning
of Female Agents, wheedling and delu∣ding
them, and playing the Game another Way,
till they are decov'd into Wedlock; the Man
pretending himself Quality, and a Person equal
in Estate; by which Craft a certain <HI>Kentish</HI>
Lady of Fortune, was most exquisitely drawn
in at once to marry a City Chimney-sweeper;
and was forc'd to stand by it too, after she came
to an understanding of the Bargain she had
made; and another West Country Lady, a
Highwayman, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="384"/>
THESE Matches, however, come within the
reach of our Complaint, and are but with too
much Justice branded with the Charge of Ma∣trimonial
Whoredom. It is true, in these Cases
it is the Money more then the Sensuality, the
Fortune more than the Woman; and so it
might be called Matrimonial Avarice. But as
the knowing of the Woman is the essential fi∣nishing
Part of the Work, and the Title or
Claim to the Estate is fix'd upon a full Posses∣sion,
which they call a Consummation of the
Marriage; the Word Whoredom is not foreign
to the Charge, at least on the Man's Side, be∣cause
he lies with the Woman, not as a wedded
Wife, according to GOD'S holy Ordinance, but
meerly to entitle him to her Estate, which, in
short, is perfecting the End of Matrimony,
and no Man can say, it is a legal Marriage in
the Sight of Him whose appointment only can
make Matrimony lawful.</P>
<P>MARRYING Women by force, can never be
called marrying according to GOD'S holy Or∣dinance;
for all Violence is unjust, and all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>njustice is inconsistent with Holiness. For
an impure and righteous Design can never be
comprehended in a holy and pure Institution;
it is determined by almost all the Laws of Ma∣trimony
in the World, that Marriage ought to
be the Act and Deed of both the Parties, the
Act and Deed not of their meer Compliance,
and submission by Nece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity, but the Act of
their Minds, their free and unconstrained
Choice; and if it be not so, it is not really a
lawful Marriage. Marriage by constraint is
like a Bond given in Prison, the Party is not
bound to the Payment: To be marry'd by force
is not to be Married, but to be taken Captive
<PB N="369" REF="385"/>
and ravished, as the <HI>Turks</HI> take Slaves, and
then chu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them for their Beauty, single
them out for the Seraglio, to be lain with by
the Emperor, or by the Basha or Grand Vizier,
whose Serail they are enclosed in, whenever
he pleases to demand them.</P>
<P>IN a word, a forc'd Marriage is a Contra∣diction
in Speech, the Terms are inconsistent;
'tis no Marriage at all, or, if you will call it a
Marriage, 'tis no Matrimony. How are the
Women so us'd, said to take such a Man to be
their wedded Husband? The very meaning of
the Word Matrimony, in several Languages,
signifies chusing: Can a Woman be said to
chuse the Man, when she is dragg'd to his Bed
as a Malefactor is dragg'd to Execution, or, as
we express it, as a Bear to the Stake? <HI>that is
to say,</HI> to the Place where he is to be Baited
with Dogs, and which he knows is to be his
Case, and therefore hangs back till he is haul'd
along by the Ring in his Nose, and cannot re∣sist
it.</P>
<P>BRING this back to our former Test: Every
Marriage where the pure and simple End of
the Matrimony is not such as agrees with the
religious End of the Institution, is, in Sense,
a Matrimonial Whoredom, and no other, and,
among all the rest, this of forcing a Woman to
be marry'd, is one of the worst.</P>
<P>I must be allow'd here to except Political
State Marriages, made for the Interest of Na∣tions,
forming Alliances and Friendships, bind∣ing
or engaging Consederacies and Leagues,
between Princes and People.</P>
<P>ALSO Family-Marriages for the preserving
Estates in the Lines and Blood of Houses, keep∣ing
up the Names and Relations, and the like
<PB N="370" REF="386"/>
prudent Ends; in which Case, though Vio∣lence
is not used, yet 'tis generally expected
the Women should comply, and they do com∣ply,
I may say they do always comply indeed.
I scarce remember an Instance in History of
any that have refused.</P>
<P>IF there is any thing in these Matches to
the dislike of the Parties, they must take it as
an Accident to the Dignity of their Birth, and
go through it as well as they can; they have
generally the State and Honour of their Birth
and Families, and the Titles they possess, to
make up the Deficiencies, and to be Equiva∣lents
for the loss of their personal Endearments;
so we have nothing to say to those Things.
If Princes and great Persons are content to
marry on those Conditions, they must do as
they please, the Consequence is to themselves.
We are not speaking here of People under the
Influence of Politick Government, and who
move this Way or that, by Reasons of State;
but of People within the Circle of Equality
with our selves, and under the Government
of Laws both of Justice and Reason, and also of
the Constitution; and to such, I think, what
I have observed, is just. Matrimony is a Law
of Decency, binding to Christians, and to Peo∣ple
who pretend to live and act as Christians
do, or should do; and those who do not proceed
in it with a due regard to Decency and Chri∣stianity
too, should lay aside the Name of Chri∣stian,
and pretend to it no more.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are various Sorts of forced
Marriages. Those which I have named, <HI>viz.</HI> tak∣ing
a Woman away by Strength, and terrifying
her afterward into Compliance, our Laws, as I
<PB N="371" REF="387"/>
have said, have declared against; so that I need
say nothing more to them.</P>
<P>THERE is also a violence of Importunity,
and a violence of Authority; both these also
I have spoken to at length, as well as the Vio∣lence
occasioned by the Person having it in
his or her Power to give or with-hold the For∣tunes
and Portions of the Persons.</P>
<P>BUT there is yet a violence of Treachery;
and this is also a Crime which indeed ought to
be punished by the Judge. This is generally
practis'd upon the Ladies indeed, but some∣times
both Sides are engag'd, and it is done
with the utmost Cunning and Artifice: <HI>First,</HI> a
Spy, or secret Agent is plac'd in the Family, (or
as near it as may be) where the Person lives,
and who insinuating into the Acquaintance of
the Lady, and perhaps into her Considence and
Favour, fails not to encroach gradually so far,
as to bring the Person who desires her Assist∣ance,
or employs her for that Purpose, into the
Lady's Company; recommends him, gives his
Character, sets other People to give his Cha∣racter;
and thus, in a word, the Lady is SET, as
a Rook sets a Cully, for a Sharper, that is to
say; for, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS my Readers may be too sober to
understand the <HI>Newgate</HI> Language, that is suit∣able
to this wicked Work; namely, that the
Cully is an innocent or ignorant Person, who a
Sharper, that is a Gamester, wants to draw
in to Play.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Rook</HI> is a third Person, who sets him
as they call it, that is, gets into his Company,
insinuates into his Society, scrapes Acquaint∣ance
with him, and so gets him to an Alehouse
or Tavvern, where the Gamester is sure to lie
<PB N="372" REF="388"/>
ready, and so draw the poor ignorant Man in
to play, and cheat him of his Money.</P>
<P>IN like manner the <HI>Sharper</HI> here employs
the <HI>Rook</HI> too, and who, in these Cases, is al∣ways
a Woman. She is sure to get acquainted
with the Lady; and, after some time, and get∣ting
into her Confidence, takes care to let the
Lady know, that she understands that a cer∣tain
Gentleman, who lodges in such a Place, is
in Love with her; that she came to understand
it by a very odd Accident; and then she tells
her a formal Story, that being at such a Place a
visiting, and some Company coming in that
were Strangers, they all sat down to drink Tea;
that there was a young Gentleman, a pretty
modest kind of Gentleman among them, which
the Lady of the House call'd Cousin, and that
accidentally rising up to make Room for more
Company, the Gentleman, says the Spy, hap∣pened
to be plac'd to sit next to me; upon
which, says she, I push'd my Chair back to sit
farther off.</P>
<P>BUT what do you mean, says the Lady,
(perhaps willing enough to hear of the Thing)
of being in Love with me, when he was a
Stranger to you?</P>
<P>LAW, <HI>my Dear,</HI> says she, I never saw the
Gentleman before in my Life. But—</P>
<P>BUT what—What makes you talk such
Stuff? says the Lady; still nettled with what
she had said subtilly and slily before.</P>
<P>WELL, he's a clever handsome Gentleman,
that I must needs say; and so she passes it off,
and talks of something else to see how the Lady
would take it.</P>
<P>AS she thought, so it was; the Lady was
touch'd with the first Piece of the Tale, and still
<PB N="373" REF="389"/>
kept her original Speech in her Thoughts, that
the Gentleman was in Love with her; but be∣ing
resolved to put her to the Necessity of ask∣ing
her again, she kept back a great while;
at last the Lady brought it about again, and
ask'd, Who this Gentleman was?</P>
<P>SHE answered nimbly, she did not know
him; but, it seems, he was one of her Ad∣mirers.</P>
<P>WHAT do you mean by that? <HI>says she,</HI> I
don't know him.</P>
<P>'TIS no matter for that, <HI>says she,</HI> he knows
you.</P>
<P>HOW do you know that? <HI>says the Lady,</HI> when
you say you don't know the Man.</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> I know it for all that.</P>
<P>AND thus she led her on Artfully, till she
found she had raised her Expectation a little;
and then she told her Story thus:</P>
<P>WHY, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> as I told you, I
thrust my Chair back to sit farther off, the Gen∣tleman
being like to sit next me; but Madam
—, meaning the Lady at whose House they
were, came, and thrusting the Gentleman's
Chair next to mine; Come, Sir, says she to
him, pray sit next to this Gentlewoman, she
lodges in the same House where the Lady lives
that is your particular Favourite.</P>
<P>SAY you so, <HI>says the Gentleman,</HI> with all my
Heart; I honour every Thing that is but
known to Madam—, meaning your self;
and so he sat down.</P>
<P>WHO can that be? <HI>says the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, indeed, <HI>says she,</HI> I don't know that;
but he is a very fine Gentleman, I assure you;
so fine a Carriage, so modest, and talks so
fine.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="390"/>
THEN you talk'd with him, it seems, <HI>says
the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>THE Company were very merry, <HI>says she,</HI>
and evey Body talk'd, But he has a World of
Wit, that's certain.</P>
<P>NAY, I know you are a good Judge, <HI>says the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> that don't follow; but
all the Company said so, as well as I.</P>
<P>NOT to his Face, I hope.</P>
<P>NO, Madam; but he went away. My Lord
—fetch'd him away in his Coach and six.</P>
<P>THIS touch'd her again; and the cunning
Manager could perceive it plain enough. So
she dropp'd the Discourse again, and run on up∣on
other Things; but upon several Turns the
Lady brought it about again: At last, she was
simple enough to ask her, If she thought there
was any Thing in it? Which was all the Crea∣ture
wanted.</P>
<P>SHE answered, yes, indeed, she believed there
was, for she could perceive the Gentleman was
mightily pleased when any Body did but speak
of her.</P>
<P>BUT who, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> could pretend to
name me to him.</P>
<P>O, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> I doubt not he had given
Occasion enough for that before.</P>
<P>I hope you took no notice that you knew
me, <HI>says the Lady.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, Madam, how could I help that, <HI>says
she,</HI> when they all told him I lodged in the
same House.</P>
<P>WHY, that's true indeed, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> I
didn't think of that.</P>
<P>WELL, Madam, you need not be concern'd,
<HI>says she,</HI> I said nothing to your Disadvantage, I
assure you.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="391"/>
THEN she began to enquire into the Dis∣course;
and the subtil Creature took care to
tell her a thousand fine Things of him, which
he never said; how he toasted her Health, and
what fine Things he said of her, when, perhaps,
not a Word was ever mentioned. But she saw
it work'd as she would have it, till, in short,
she brought her to be in Love with the Gentle∣man
too, and that before she had seen him.</P>
<P>TIME brought Things about; and the young
Lady was weak enough to go and visit the Lady
at the House where this Gentleman had been
seen, and which, it seems, was but a few Doors
off; and the Spy had so much Knowledge of it,
as to give the Gentleman notice, who found
Ways to get into the Company, and to make his
Acquaintance with her. And thus it began.</P>
<P>FROM this Beginning, the Manager carry'd
on all the rest. The Gentleman was represent∣ed
as an Heir to a great Estate, but not quite of
Age, and that if she had him she might depend
upon a thousand a Year Jointure; and, in a
word, she drew the unwary Lady into a pri∣vate
Marriage, and so to throw herself away
upon a young Fellow, without a Shilling in
his Pocket, and a good-for-nothing empty∣headed
Fellow to boot. As good hap was, he
was not a Rake, and so she was less ruined
than she would otherwise have been; but still
she was so far undone, as to be able to make
no Provision for her self but what he pleased to
do in good Nature, which was about One hun∣dred
Pounds a Year; and was all she could save
out of about Thirteen thousand Pounds.</P>
<P>I could fill up this Account with such Matri∣monial
Frauds as this, and some much more
tragical; but there is no Room for it: This
<PB N="376" REF="392"/>
may suffice to shew the Meaning of the thing;
'tis not so remote from the Design as may be
suggested. Trapanning of Women is not much
better than Whoring. It is true, the Woman
is innocent, the Whoredom is on the Man's
Side only, but on his Side it is evidently so,
and no otherwise; 'tis a Complication of Crime;
'tis a double Robbery, for they plunder the in∣nocent
Lady of her Honour and of her Estate,
both at once; not only her Money is seiz'd
on, and immediately wasted, squander'd, per∣haps
gam'd away, or worse, but she is oxposed
to the utmost Contempt and Disgrace.</P>
<P>FIRST, expecting that she is received into
the Arms of a Gentleman, and that she takes
into her Embraces and to her Affection, a Man
of Honour and Fortune, she is prostituted to a
Scoundrel, a Mechanick, or, which is infinite∣ly
worse, a Rake, a debauch'd infected Carkase,
who at once despoils her of her self, so we may
justly call it, and communicates to her the
worst of all Contagion, a Poison in her Blood,
an impure and loathsome Plague, so that she is
ruin'd at once in Life and Estate.</P>
<P>THIS is worse than Matrimonial Whore∣dom,
for it is Matrimonial Murther, and the
poor Lady is undone; she is Beggar'd on one
hand, and ruin'd on the other, and is soon trans∣pos'd
from a fine furnished House to an Hospital,
and from thence to the Grave, and perhapsstarv'd
too, to make her Miseries more compleat.</P>
<P>THIS is a Mischief we yet want a Law for;
and, indeed, 'tis wonderful to me that we should
do so. It seems to me, that a Man in such Cir∣cumstances
merits as much the Gallows for an
attempt of that Nature, as it is possible for him
to do by any other Crime he can commit. I
<PB N="377" REF="393"/>
would humbly recommend it to the Legislature
to think of proper Remedies for so dreadful a
Mischief.</P>
<P>IT is not for me to dictate Measures in such
Cases; 'tis enough that I represent the Crime,
that I endeavour to dress it up in such Cloaths
as are proper to set it forth in. All that is due
to a Robber, a Ravisher, and a Murtherer,
seems to be due to the Person that is thus guilty;
for he manifestly commits all these Crimes,
and that in the most intense Degree, 1. He is
a Robber, for he vests himself with a legal
Claim to the Lady's Estate, by a fraudulent,
surreptitous and deceitful Attack, a Feint and
Disguise, making himself appear to be what
he is not, and taking Possesion as a Robber;
being quite another Person than him he was
supposed to be.</P>
<P>2. HE is a Ravisher of the worst Kind, because
he possesses the Person and Honour of the Lady
by Fraud, and in a Circumstance, which if she
was acquainted with, she would never submit to,
but by the utmost Violence, and perhaps would
much rather chuse to be murthered than to
be so used.</P>
<P>3. To conclude: He is a Murtherer, and that in
the most horrid Method of Murther that can be
imagined. I need go no farther to describe the
Case, than is done in an Example given in this
very Work, <HI>Page</HI> 177. where the Tragedy was
lamentable indeed.</P>
<P>WHAT now can be esteemed a Punishment
equal to this Crime? And why might it not be
called a righteous Law to punish with Death a
Man, that, deceiving a Woman in Marriage,
should bring to her a Body infected with the
foul Disease, and give it his Wife, it being
<PB N="378" REF="394"/>
known that he contracted the Distemper before
Marriage.</P>
<P>NOR would it be so hard to prove the Fact
as some may imagine; I mean, that it would
not be difficult to state in the Terms of such a
Law, certain and publik Clauses, by which the
Fact should be both enquired into, and admit
a fair Proof; for such is the Nature of the Con∣tagion,
that it is not easily concealed, and the
Evidences may be made very clear; as parti∣cularly
the Person's having been under Cure
before his Marriage; such a Man ought never
to dare to marry, except with the Whore who
infected him; and there indeed he ought to go,
that they may Rot together.</P>
<P>BUT for such a Man to apply to a Woman
of Virtue and Modesty; sound in Body, and
and upright in her Intention, come to her
with a Contagion in his Vitals, and abuse her
in such a vile, odious and abominable Kind!
As the Crime is not to be named without Abhor∣rence
and Execration, so the Criminal merits
to be turn'd out of humane Society, that he may
abuse no more, and may be a Terror to others.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY this deserves Death as much as
several Crimes, which are at this time punished
with it, and particularly as much as Highway∣Robbery,
for the Plunder is attended with infi∣nitely
worse Circumstances, and has many
worse Aggravations attending it.</P>
<P>I add no more. I cannot doubt but the fatal
Consequences, and the frequency of this hor∣rible
Crime, (and that in these Days, I believe,
more than ever) will at length awaken Justice;
and we shall, one time or other, have a suitable
Law to punish it; and this, I believe, would
be the only Way to prevent it for the future.</P>

<HEAD>THE
CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> am now come to the Conclusion
of this Work: I had Thoughts to
have given a longer Preface to it,
intimating the true End and Design
of it: But I think 'tis better in
the Form of a Conclusion: For
when can a Work be better explain'd than after
it is done?</P>
<P>I can find but two Objections that can lie a∣gainst
this Undertaking, or the Performance of it;
after the strictest Inquiry into every Part of it,
and, as Author, I think my self pretty clear in
them Both. Of which the impartial Reader is
to be the Judge.</P>
<P>1. WHETHER the Satyr be Just.</P>
<P>2. WHETHER the Manner be Justifiable.</P>
<P>IF indeed the Satyr is not just, the Author
has done nothing, and can have nothing to say
why he should not lie under the worst of Cen∣sure;
but he is under no Care upon that Sub∣ject:
Even the most Innocent will hardly enter
upon the Point with me, or venture to say,
<PB N="380" REF="396"/>
that tho' they may be clear of it themselves, that
therefore no Body is guilty; and as for the
rest, tho' they are harden'd against Blushing at
it, I don't find any of them harden'd enough to
deny it.</P>
<P>WE are come to an Age, wherein 'tis not the
Mode to acknowledge and reform a Mistake,
but to add a Front to the Fact, and Triumph in
the Crimes, which they should be ashamed of:
It seems below them to vindicate their Chara∣cter,
they'll rather illustrate it with the Fault
they should wipe off, and count the Shame of it
their Glory.</P>
<P>THIS happy Custom is the Author's Vindi∣cation
in this Work; for now scorning to deny
the Charge, or enter into an Enquiry in form,
whether <HI>guilty</HI> or not <HI>guilty;</HI> they are for giving
the Matter of Fact in Evidence, and insisting
that there is no Crime in it. And thus we
join Issue upon the Merit of the Cause.</P>
<P>IF it be so; if there is no such thing as Im∣modesty
after Matrimony, and that nothing can
be indecent or unlawful between a Man and his
Wife; if Matrimonial Liberties are without
Bounds, and there are no Limitations to that
conjugal Freedom, neither by the Laws of GOD
or of Nature.</P>
<P>IF the Man cannot sin against his Wife, or
the Wife against her Husband; if no Excesses
can be complained of, and nothing can be ei∣ther
out of Measure, or out of Season; if no
unnatural Violences can be offered, and the
Woman can have no reason to <HI>turn her Slipper
the wrong Side upward against her Husband.</HI></P>
<P>IF the Laws of Matrimony cannot be broken,
the Ends of Matrimony not defeated, the Rea∣son
of Matrimony not be mistaken, and a
Marriage cannot be made a Masque to a Crime.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="397"/>
IN a word, if all the Complaints of this
kind are causeless and needless, and there are
neither the Crimes or the Criminals to be found,
or to be heard of among us, then indeed the
Satyr cannot be just, and the Author deserves
the Censure of a false Accuser. Let him be
try'd by GOD, and his Country; and let the
abused Persons who are without the Sin, throw
the first Stone at him.</P>
<P>BUT if the Fact is to be prov'd, if the Guilt
is notorious, if he not only has pointed out the
Crime, but is ready, if called upon in a lawful
way, to point out the Criminals too, and to
convict them upon their own Evidence, and
out of their own Mouths; if they not only
daily commit those Things, but daily boast of
them; if the Coffee-houses are witnesses on one
Side, and the Tea-Tables blush on the other,
and lewd Dialogues on that wicked Subject cir∣culate
from one to t'other; if the differing Sexes
are united in the guilt, tho' in a differing way,
and the odious Facts are become flagrant, 'tis
then high time to combate the Vice, and en∣deavour
by any possible Ways to bring the
World to blush for them, since they are past
blushing for themselves.</P>
<P>AS the Guilt thus legitimates the Satyr, so
the Circumstances of it, and the unhappy state
of Things justifies the Author in the Method of
attacking it. The Law cannot reach it; the
Fact is not cognisable in a way of Justice; no
criminal Process can lie in the Case, 'tis one of
the Offences that are too vile to be hid, and yet
too secret, and too much hid, to be laid hold
of. They seem to be fenced and protected by
those very Laws that should censure and ex∣pose
them; and tho' they frequently sally out,
<PB N="362" REF="398"/>
and make criminal Excursions, yet when they
are attack'd, they retreat behind the Fences
and Fortifications of the conjugal Laws, and
the Letter of Matrimony is turn'd against the
Meaning of it, as the Cannon of a Bastion,
when the Work is taken, are turn'd against the
Town which they were mounted to defend.</P>
<P>SATYR can scourge where the Lash of the
Law cannot; the Teeth and Talons of the Pen
will bite and tear; and the Satyr has a Sting
which is made for the Correction of such Of∣fences
and such Offenders as bully Justice, and
think themselves out of the reach of Prisons
and Punishments; as small Arms are of use in
Battle where the Cannon and Mortars cannot
play, and the Point of the Lance can wound
where the Balls cannot fly.</P>
<P>IF Men are fenc'd against one Thing, they
may not be fenc'd against another, and the
sense of Shame may restrain where even a
sense of Punishment will not. There are Crimes
which a lash of the Pen reach'd when a lash
at the Cart's-tail would not; and a time when
Men that have laugh'd at the Law, and ridi∣culed
all its Powers, have yet been laugh'd
out of their Crimes by a just Satyr, and brought
to the necessity of hanging themselves for
Shame, or reforming to prevent it.</P>
<P>IF then the Crime be evident, and yet the
Law impotent, who will contend that the
Satyr is not just? 'Tis the only unexceptiona∣ble
Case in which not the Justice only, but the
Necessity of a Satyr, is to be insisted on.</P>
<P>SOME will say, and in this particular Case I
think they are right, that there is no such thing
as an unjust Satyr; that a Satyr is never wrong,
nor can be so; for that,</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="399"/>
1. IF the Fact be not true, 'tis no more a
Satyr but a Slander; 'tis a LIE, and merits the
Correction of the Law.</P>
<P>2. IF the Fact be true, but is in it self no
Crime, the Satyr has no Teeth, no Claws, it
can neither Bite or Sting; and then again 'tis
no more a Satyr; it has only a kind of close
par'd Nails with which it can scratch its own
Face, and can hurt no Body else; so that 'tis
no more a Satyr, nor will it bear to be call'd
by that Name. But this is out of the Way
here.</P>
<P>WE insist upon the Justice of the Satyr, as
well from the Nature of the Charge it brings,
as from the certainty of the Fact proved by
the Confession of the guilty Offenders, and the
general Testimony of the Times, as above.</P>
<P>IT remains then to speak of the Manner of
the Performance, and enter upon the Vindica∣tion
of it, a thing much more properly under∣taken,
now 'tis finish'd, than it cou'd be before
it was begun.</P>
<P>THE only Objections which can lie against
the manner, I think, come into these two. (1.)
The necessity of speaking a Language that is
unpleasant to hear, and which, at least, seems
to tread on the brink of the same Indecency
which it reproves; AND which also the Author
has sufficiently express'd his dread of. OR, (2.)
The deficiency of the Reproof from an over∣restraint,
and declining to express Things fully
on that very Account, for fear of offending one
Way, offending too much the other.</P>
<P>I have, with the utmost Care, avoided the
first of these; I have studied to shun all Inde∣cency
of Expression, or saying any thing that
<PB N="384" REF="400"/>
might offend the chastest Mind, and the most
modest Ear, allowing but just room to mention
the Crime that is reproved, and hardly that in
some Places sufficient to have it understood.</P>
<P>IF I have given the least Cause of Complaint,
I profess it to be unseen and undesigned; nor
upon revising the whole Work, do I yet see
any Reason for altering or wiping out any
thing on that Account.</P>
<P>THE Scripture it self, the sacred Pattern of
Modesty in Expression, and which I have all
along kept in my Eye as a Director in that
particular Point, has, in many Places, been ob∣liged
to speak plainer than I have done in the
like Cases.</P>
<P>BUT when the Censure is to be pass'd, there
must be so much said at least; as may let the
Reader understand what it is we reprove, or
else we speak of nothing, and to no purpose;
yet I have studied with the utmost Care to do
it, so as to leave no room for Reproach. None
can find Occasion to blush here but those that
are guilty; let them blush and reform, then the
End of the Satyr is answered.</P>
<P>AS to the second Case; I cannot but lament
the necessity I have been under to omit several
flagrant Stories, with Names and Sirnames too
attending them, good Evidence of Fact ready,
which yet I have not been able to find Words
to express with Decency enough to bear read∣ing,
or to preserve the Purity of the Design,
and the Dignity of a just Satyr.</P>
<P>WHAT vile and perhaps unheard-of Practices
could I have exposed, could I have found Words
to dress up the Relation in? And what inimi∣table
Examples have I ready to produce to sup∣port
<PB N="385" REF="401"/>
the Truth of the Facts, would the Stories
but bear telling.</P>
<P>I confess, 'tis something hard that Men shou'd
sin on, only because they cannot be modestly
reproved; that they shou'd go on in superlative
Wickedness, with an Impunity only owing to
the horrid exorbitance of their Crime, too dirty
to be spoken of, too nauseous to be mentioned.
Why has not our fruitful Inventions added
some Signals, some Figures, to serve instead of
Speech, (as I have observed the <HI>Turks</HI> do, by
turning up the Slipper) by which Signals or
Figures the filthy Part might be expressed,
without fouling the Mouth, or affronting the
Ears of others.</P>
<P>BUT it is not to be done, and therefore, as
above, I have chosen to leave out many long
Histories of inexpressible Lewdness, parti∣cularly
under the Matrimonial Cover, and
which would have given a keener Edge to the
Satyr, and have confirmed the Necessity of the
Reproof in this Case, more than all that has
been express'd. But, I say, it is not to be
done.</P>
<P>WHERE I have been necessitated to come to
the very Brink of the Fact, and to go as far as
Language would suffer me; certainly I hope
for so much Charity in the Reader, as to ac∣knowledge
the Justice and Necessity of going
so far, at the same time giving the true Reason
of my going no farther.</P>
<P>'TIS a hardship an Author is seldom put to,
to be obliged to break off in the middle of his
Evidence; to omit and drop all the Illustrations
of his Story, and scarce give you enough of the
Generals to guess at the Particulars by; but
this is my Case, and all in obedience to that
<PB N="386" REF="402"/>
Modesty, the trespassing upon which is the
ground of the whole Complaint. If these Men
could be talked to in their own Language; if
the odious Expressions they use in their ordi∣nary
Discourse could be thrown in their Faces,
and they could be daub'd with their own
Dirt, it would describe them in a more ef∣fectual
manner, they would be painted in the
most suitable Colours, and dress'd up in the
Robes that would best become them; and, in
one respect, it ought to be so, that every Crime
might be shown as it really is.</P>
<P>IT was a Practice in some of the Nations in
the Eastern Countries, that if a Woman was
convicted of Adultery, she was stript stark
naked, and led about the City, that she might
be exposed in the same Nakedness in which she
had voluntarily exposed her self, and so be
punished in the very kind of her Offence.</P>
<P>BUT this would not do in a Christian Coun∣try;
it would be it self an Offence against De∣cency,
and a Breach of the very Modesty
which it was intended to punish, and therefore
it cannot be done; in like manner the Crime
I am reproving, cannot be expos'd in the lively
manner that other Offences are expos'd in; be∣cause,
as I may say, we cannot speak the Lan∣guage:
The Dialect these People talk is a
great part of the Crime; and as it is not to be
made use of for their Reproof, so we are straiten'd
exceedingly in Reproving; and they triumph
over me in this very Part, that I talk in the
dark, and reprove by Allegory and Metaphor,
that People may know, or not know what I
mean, just as it may happen.</P>
<P>THIS may, in some Sense, indeed be true,
as I have said above; but the Hardship rises
<PB N="387" REF="403"/>
from the black Circumstances atrending the
Crimes they commit; and, of all People, they
should be the last to boast of that Advantage,
seeing they must own at the same time, 'tis be∣cause
their Behaviour is so much too vile to be
reproved, that it cannot be mentioned; the
Language of it is so foul, that it will not read;
modest Tongues cannot speak it; modest Ears
cannot hear it; like some particular Trials in
our Courts of Justice, when they are obliged to
desire of the Women to withdraw, because they
may be obliged to use such Expressions as it is
not decent to mention before them, or modest
in them to be in the hearing of; and yet,
without which Words spoken in the grossest
and plainest manner, the Cause cannot be tried,
the Evidence be taken, or the Offender con∣victed.</P>
<P>THIS is exactly the Case; and under this
Difficulty the whole Work labours in almost
every Part. But I have taken the Part that, I
think, Religion and Decency directs; that is,
to go as far as I can, and leave Conscience to
work the rest its own way. I have painted out
the Crime as fairly as justifiable Language will
allow; and where it will not, I content my self
with leaving the Guilty to judge themselves by
the general Hints given them. The silent
Needle in the Compass points to the <HI>Pole,</HI> but
says no more; yet the Pilot, which knows its
meaning, steers by that Direction, and brings the
Ship safe into Port.</P>
<P>THE Facts are indeed notorious, and the less
plain <HI>English</HI> will serve; the Things I reprove
are not so very abstruse; there are few married
People but will understand me; and all the
guilty, I am sure, will read their Crimes plain
<PB N="388" REF="404"/>
enough, they will need no Explanations; if
they pretend to it, they will be too easily con∣futed,
by referring them to their own Prac∣tice.</P>
<P>IT is true, there are still some ill Usages a∣mong
these People, some Matrimonial Whore∣doms
which are wholly omitted, which it is im∣possible
to mention, no not at the greatest distance,
no not by Simily, Allegory, or any other Re∣presentation.
They are too wicked to admit
the least Suggestion about them, or so much as
to guide the Reader to guess at them. Nor are
they a few Things which I am thus obliged to
overlook. But there is no doing it; they must
be buried in Silence if they cannot be reprov'd,
because they cannot be mentioned. Let the
Offenders, the guilty Persons, consider, Heaven
can find out Ways to punish them, tho' we can∣not
find out Words to reprove them.</P>
<P>THAT Justice, that brings to light the hid∣den
Works of Darkness, can make the Crime
publick in the Punishment; and there it may
be read with Terror by every one that looks on
it, when their Ears will not be offended with
the Description. Nor is it an unusual Method;
Providence often thinks fit to do so. Drunken∣ness,
tho' in secret, is made publick by <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>'s
Signals, <HI>Who has redness of eyes, who hath
wounds without cause? they that tarry long at the
Wine,</HI> &amp;c. Prov. xxiii. 29.</P>
<P>THUS it may be said again, who hath lean∣ness
of Countenance, who hat rottenness of
Bones, who hath loathsome Diseases? Are they
not the People I speak of? Let them take heed;
'tis not the Whoremaster and the Strumpet a∣lone
that contract Filthiness and Distempers;
and 'twill be a dreadful Rebuke for a pretender
<PB N="389" REF="405"/>
to lawful Things, and no more, to see himself
brought to the same Distress by his Excesses,
that others are reduc'd by their Vices and open
Wickednesses, and loaded with those Diseases,
which so strongly intimate another kind of
Guilt, that no Body will believe him Innocent,
tho' he really be so.</P>
<P>I leave it to Physicians to explain what
I say, and to tell whether there are not many
scandalous Diseases which People bring upon
themselves by their Intemperances and Ex∣cesses,
which are so near the main Contagion,
that no People will believe they are Innocent
that have them, and that yet may befal those
who have never been guilty out of the Mar∣riage
Bed.</P>
<P>LET such People reflect upon the Grief it
will be to them, to be universally condemn'd
where they are not guilty; and to bear the
reproach of a Crime they have not committed
for the Crime which none imagine, and which
they have dwelt unreprov'd in so many Years,
till they come to be a Reproof to themselves,
and a Reproach to all about them.</P>
<P>I could give Examples of several who have
fatally suffered in this Manner, under the
Weight of their own immoderate Practices, to
say no worse of them; and I could, I believe,
find some Instances of those who have perished
under the Misery, rather than discover the
Grief they lay under, least they should be sup∣posed
guilty of what they abhorred so much as
to think of.</P>
<P>BUT how just is divine Vengeance thus to
reprove those Intemperances in his own Way.
which were otherwise out of the reach of hu∣man
Laws, and indeed of human Eyes? And
<PB N="390" REF="406"/>
how should the People I speak of, whose Con∣duct
I cannot reprove, because too foul to be
mentioned, reflect, that Heaven can find out
Ways to make them a Punishment to them∣selves,
and join their Sin and their Shame to∣gether?</P>
<P>I could have also given some living Examples
of the Intemperances which I have mentioned,
which have liv'd to be extreamly exposed, even
tho' they have not been spoken of in print; in
whom the distemper'd Bodies, aching Heads, tot∣tering
Joints, besides the many nameless, fil∣thy
and unclean Diseases that have hung upon
them, have been their lasting Reproof, and they
have carried the reproach of their Follies about
with them where-ever they went, till no Body
has car'd to come into their Company, and they
have been a Shame even to themselves.</P>
<P>THESE Things have been the Fruit of those
Doings, which they call lawful; their conjugal
Excesses, those Liberties which they have all
along pretended Heaven allow'd them; Liberties
Nature dictated, Love prompted, and Matri∣mony
made lawful; as if Heaven, Nature and
the Matrimonial Law, which is founded on the
Laws both of GOD and Nature, had directed
them to an immoderate Use of the Liberties
they allow'd; which is no more true, than that
because GOD gave the Wine (a noble Plant)
and the Juice of its Fruit, for our Comfort, and
for the support and supply of the Spirits, had
allowed us to drink, and to drink it with Plea∣sure;
and that Nature, conforming to the Bounty
of Heaven, had given us a gust or love to the
Liquor it self; that therefore GOD and Nature
allowed us to be drunk, to drink to Excess,
<PB N="391" REF="407"/>
to drink away our Sense, our Understanding
and our Life, as many daily do.</P>
<P>I would conclude this with an earnest and se∣rious
Monition to all the considering, rational
Part of Mankind, who call themselves Chri∣stians,
and would be called so, who are willing
to act as such, and to answer to themselves, not
supposing they had any other Account to give
for all their Behaviour; I say, I would move them
to enter so far into the Government of themselves,
as becomes Men of Sense and of Virtue, to put
a due Restraint upon themselves in the use of
lawful Liberties, and to act, not like Madmen
and Furies, but like Men of Understanding,
to act in such a Manner, as they may not re∣proach
themselves hereafter with wasting their
Youth and Strength, and bringing Age and
Weakness upon themselves before their Time.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, GOD Almighty, who form'd
the Man, and who committed him, in a great
Measure, to the Government of himself, did
not do so with a general leave to live how he
pleased; did not leave him to the gust of his
Appetite, without giving the least Limits to
himself by his Reason, but as he gave him
superior Faculties, so he gave those Faculties,
and placed them in a superiority one to another
that they might be a Check to the separate
Motions and Operations, and keep the whole
Machine in order.</P>
<P>IF the Man Breaks this Order; if he invert,
Nature; if he gives himself Liberties that
GOD and Nature intended him not, and such
as are inconsistent with the good Order of the
Machine, he will put the whole Fabrick out of
Tune; nor can he expect the rest of the Moti∣ons
can perform as they would otherwise do.</P>
<P><PB N="392" REF="408"/>
IF the Spring of a Watch be over strained
it will cease to Draw if the Ballance be over∣loaded,
the Motion stops. It is the like in all
other natural Motions, and 'tis so in this of
the Man. He that will put Nature out of her
proper Course, and upon Extreams which she
has not equal Powers to perform, will ruin those
Powers which she has, and, in a word, ruin the
whole Fabrick.</P>
<P>IF the Man is himself; if he is Master of
his Reason, and sound Argument can make any
due Impression upon him, he will consider this
Part for his own sake; abstracted from its being
an Offence against his Superior, the Governor of
his Life, to whom he must Account; if, I say,
he would only consider himself, act like a ratio∣nal
Creature, and study his own Interest, it
must move him to behave himself prudently.</P>
<P>I know nothing, no not one Instance in
Life, wherein Virtue may be more truly said
to be its own Reward, than in this Particular:
Take the Case inverted, who has length of Days,
who sound Constitution? who has strength of
Body, agility of Limbs, who enjoys an unin∣terrupted
Health, but the Temperate, the Mo∣derate,
and the Virtuous? Their Vitals are not
exhausted; Nature is not oppress'd; the Vi∣gour
of the Spirits expended, and the Marrow
of their Bones wasted: Their Youth has not
robbed their old Age; or their untimely Vice
diverted the Channels of Nature, and turn'd
the Water from the Mill.</P>
<P>THE Modest, the Chast, the temperate
Youth, is the hail, the chearful, and the healthy
old Man: He that lives too fast, goes to his
Grave too soon; 'tis a course, but significant Ex∣pression,
He that lives <HI>a Gallop,</HI> goes to the Devil <HI>a
<PB N="393" REF="409"/>
Trot.</HI> The meaning is plain; excess in Youth
anticipates old Age; they that will tear them∣selves
in Pieces, who can patch them up? 'Tis
in vain to fly to Art; Physick may cleanse
the Blood, correct the noxious Humour, clear
the Stomach, and help the Digesture; but
Physick cannot make the Body anew; Phy∣sick
cannot give a new Fund of Life, and form
Nature upon a new Foundation. Physick can∣not
restore when the Liver is wasted, when the
Lungs are spit out of the Mouth by early
Catarrhs, when <HI>the Wheel is broken at the Cistern:</HI>
when, as <HI>Job</HI> says, <HI>the Reins are consumed within
us,</HI> what can Physick do for us? Art may as∣sist
Nature; but Art cannot give Youth, nor
restore that Vigour which Vice has exhausted.
When the <HI>Dart is struck through the Liver,</HI>
when the Heart ceases to beat Time to the
Pendulum, 'tis in vain to talk to Physicians:
As you have put your selves in the Devil's
stead to destroy, Physicians cannot put them∣selves
in GOD'S stead to <HI>Create:</HI> Who shall sup∣ply
in Age what the Spendthrift, the Extra∣vagant
has wasted in Youth? A frugal Use of an
Estate preserves it for the Heirs; whereas he
that cuts the Timber down young, shall have
no large high Trees to leave behind him; and he
that, without manuring and good Husbandry,
leaves the Land to be beggar'd, and plough'd out
of Heart, shall be sure not to keep up the Rent;
but the Estate will decay, and the Heir be re∣duc'd.</P>
<P>IN a Word, Temperance and Moderation
keeps Nature in a due state of Health, and lays
in an early Provision for Time, a Stock for old
Age to live upon, hands on Vigour with the
Years, and makes Age triumph in the goodness
<PB N="394" REF="410"/>
of the Constitution: Whereas Vice leaves
Youth groaning and mouring under Aches,
Rheumaticks and Hydrophicks before its Time,
the Joints trembling cannot support the Body,
the Nerves are innervated, the Sinews shrunk;
in a Word, the Blood is poison'd, the Spirit ex∣hausted,
and the whole Mass corrupted; thus the
Fabrick sinks like a Noble opulent City swal∣low'd
up in an Earthquake, there it stands a sad
Monument of the devouring Teeth of Crime,
and a Sacrifice to Debauchery.</P>
<P>WHENCE is it, that the Number of Physi∣cians,
Apothecaries and Surgeons, are so en∣creas'd
among us, and especially the latter, be∣sides
the innumerable Throng of Quacks, Pre∣tenders
and Dealers in Plaisters and Doses? If
Diseases were not multiply'd, the Remedies would
not crowd in upon us as they do; 'tis the Stench
of Carcases that brings the <HI>Vultures</HI> about us
and our Families: As the Groans and Cries of
dying and decaying Bodies are loud among us;
so Physick is grown noisy and clamorous.</P>
<P>HOW many Doctors and Surgeons, nay Apo∣thecaries,
ride about in their Coaches? Perhaps,
as one cunningly alledg'd, not for the Vanity
of the Equipage, but for Expedition, and that
he might be able to make more Visits in a Day;
otherwise he could not dispatch his Business, or
see all his Patients so often as they desir'd him.</P>
<P>AS our Yearly Bills are encreased, the Phy∣sicians
grown Rich, their Number more than
doubled, and their Equipages advanc'd in such a
Manner, Whence is it all? It cannot be all
meerly by the Encrease of People about us; tho'
that I know is alledged; there must be some∣thing
else; and the Reason is evident, our Lux∣ury
is encreased; and with our Luxury, our
<PB N="395" REF="411"/>
Vices, and other Extravagances, our Lascivious∣ness,
Sensuality, and, in a Word, our Impu∣dence,
and with all these our Distempers:
These enrich the Doctors, these call the Sur∣geons
and Apothecaries about us, like the
Crows about the Carcase; and they Bombard us
with the Gallipots and Glasses, as the <HI>Alge∣rines</HI>
assault a Ship with Carcases and Stink∣ing
Pots.</P>
<P>IF the Numbers of People are encreas'd a∣bout
<HI>London,</HI> that may be something, though
'tis begging the Question most egregiously to
say so, as we do by Lump, that this is the only
encrease of the Mortality. Some suggest such
an Encrease as amounts to a third Part of the
whole; and others will go so far as to tell us
they are doubled; and this they gather (as they
say) not from the excessive Numbers of Build∣ings
only, but from the Throngs of People which
are to be seen in the Streets upon all publick
Occasions. I will readily grant both these, par∣ticularly,
that there are great Numbers of new
Buildings, Streets and Squares added to the
Town, and in all the extreme Parts of it, in∣deed
an innumerable Number, such as no City
in the World can show the like, as at St.
<HI>Giles</HI>'s, Tyburn-Road, Ormond-Street, Hockley,
Finsbury, Spittle-Fields, Wapping, Rotherbith, &amp;c.
Nor is this all, but I allow that there is also a
prodigious Encrease in the Villages adjacent to
<HI>London,</HI> which, as they say, and in that indeed
they say true, are not only doubled, but some
of them encreased to several Times as many Peo∣ple
as formerly, such as at the new Docks near
<HI>Deptford,</HI> and at the Town of <HI>Deptford;</HI> also
at <HI>Greenwich, Clapham, Camberwell, Chelsea, Ken∣sington,
Hampstead, Newington, Tottenham, Ed∣monton,
Endfield, Bromley, Stratford, West Ham,
<PB N="396" REF="412"/>
Wanstead, Walthamstow, Low-Layton,</HI> and abun∣dance
more, all whose Parishes are out of
the Bills of Mortality; and were their Num∣bers
added to the last yearly Bill, would make
up the Mortalities at least to Five and thirty
thousand.</P>
<P>NOW tho' all this were true, and more, yet it
does not at all account for the Grievance in our
Morals, which I have complained of; or for
the Depredations made upon Nature, and upon
Health, by our intemperate and luxurious
Living, our immoderate and scandalous Ex∣cesses
in otherwise lawful and allowed Plea∣sures.
But let those that question it, look back
into the Book of Nature; and let them tell me,
whether the Numbers of the Sick too are not
encreased in proportion, and indeed more than
in proportion, to the Number of the Dead?
And if they will not take my Opinion, let
them know the late famous Dr. <HI>Radcliffe,</HI>
and several other Physicians, gave the same
Judgment. And I am very willing to appeal
to the Learned, whether these Excesses I have
now mentioned, have not contributed at least
to making the Age less sound in Life, if not
shorter liv'd than their Ancestors.</P>
<P>I will not attempt to abridge the Sovereignty
of Providence in its Government of the Earth;
or to say, that Heaven has not appointed and
limited the Time of Life to all his Creatures:
Yet I am not so much a Predestinarian nei∣ther,
as to pretend that Men cannot shorten
their Days by Luxury and Intemperance, Glut∣tony,
Drunkenness, and other worse and more
criminal Excesses; why should we not think
that such Crimes as these entail Heaven's Curse
upon us, and blast our Breath, and shorten our
Time, as well as Disobedience to Parents? I
<PB N="397" REF="413"/>
will not presume to say, in the Words of the
Command, be <HI>Temperate,</HI> be <HI>Virtuous,</HI> be <HI>Mo∣derate,
that thy Days may be long in the Land.</HI>
I acknowledge, that I have no direct Autho∣rity
to add a Promise to the Exhortation; but I
may take more freedom, I believe, in the alter∣native,
and say, be not Intemperate, be not Vi∣cious,
Luxurious, Immoderate and Brutal, and
add, with the Wise Man, <HI>Why should'st thou dye
before thy Time?</HI> Eccles. vii. 17.</P>
<P>WITHOUT question, Life may be shortened
by our Wickedness. How many do we see, in
almost every weekly Bill, dead of excessive
Drinking, others Duelling and Fighting;
some by one vile Excess, some by another?
Shall any Man dare to say, these did not shorten
their own Lives! Shall we say, they <HI>lived out
half their Days!</HI> Psal. lv. 23. I think it would
be affronting the Justice of Providence, to say,
they were not slain by their own Crime, cut off
by untimely Vice, or that, with <HI>David</HI>'s wicked
Men, they do not live out half their Days.</P>
<P>BUT, not to enter into Disputes of Things
remote to the Case; if Life is or is not, can
or cannot be shorten'd by our Intemperance
and Vice, the Comfort of Life may be lessen'd.
Life may be made a Burthen, loathsome and
uncomfortable, by loading it with Diseases
and Sorrows, and by bringing complicated
Miseries upon our selves in the Room of
Health and Vigour, which would otherwise be
the Lot.</P>
<P>A bright Countenance, a sprightly and brisk
Eye, a constant Smile, a nimble agile Body, a
clear Head, a strong Memory, and clean Limbs,
these are Nature's Furniture to a Man of an
untainted Race. But how often are all these
<PB N="398" REF="414"/>
original Beauties, the native Attendants upon
Youth and a good Constitution, made to droop
and flag, while Paleness and Leanness come
into the Face, Heaviness into the Heart, and
Dulness into the Head? How is the shining
sparkling of the Eye eclipsed, the Understand∣ing
lost, the Memory decay'd, and the Genius
partaking of the Contagion, entirely al∣tered?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Glory of a young Man is his Strength,</HI>
says <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. xx. 29. and one of his first
Advices after that Expression, is, <HI>give not thy
Strength unto Women;</HI> it is ture, <HI>Solomon</HI> there
means to a strange Woman, that is to say, <HI>a
Whore.</HI> But with some abatement for the Person
only, and for the Circumstances spoken to here;
the Thing is (otherwise) the same, and the Ex∣cesses
are in their Degree tho' perhaps not
every way as fatal.</P>
<P>IT was a late learned Physician who said,
that the Women wearing Hoops would make
the next Age all Cripples; that drinking Tea
would make them Rheumatick; that taking
Snuff would make them Lunatick: To which it
was said, by way of Repartee, the Doctor being a
little of a Libertine, that the Levity of the
present Times will make the next Age Atheists;
the Cavilling at Scripture, (which is now the
grand Mode) make them Hereticks; and
the talking Nonsense make them all Fools:
And now, I think, I may with equal Propriety
add, that the Vice of this Age will make the
next Age rotten.</P>
<P>CRIME has an unhappy propagating Qua∣lity;
'tis always in progression. If one Age
talks Heresy, the next Age talks Blasphemy:
If one Age talks Faction, the next Age talks
<PB N="399" REF="415"/>
Treason: If one Age talks Foolish, the next
Age talks Mad. So, in the Case before
me, if one Generation are Immoderate, the
next are Extravagant. If one Age runs to ex∣cess
in Things lawful, the next pursues the like
excesses in Things unlawful, or make those
lawful Things Crimes, by those excesses: If one
Age are Beasts, the next Age are Devils: To∣day
Matrimonial Whoredom, To-morrow Un∣bounded
Whoredom. As Vice leads, Fools fol∣low;
and where must it end but in Destru∣ction?</P>
<P>IT is the like in the Contamination of Blood;
the fatal Progression shows it self there, as well
as in other Parts. Excesses weaken the Body, sink
Nature, darken the Countenance, stupify the
Brain; To-day they reach the Body, To-mor∣row
the Soul, and, in the next Age, the
Race.</P>
<P>THE lawful Things of this Age will make
the next Age lawless; their Fathers conveyed
Blood, and they convey Poyson; our Parents
handed on Health, and we Diseases; our Chil∣dren
are born in Palaces, and are like to die in
Hospitals. Debauchery is the Parent of Di∣stemper;
Fire in the Blood makes a Frost in
the Brain; and be the Pleasures lawful or un∣lawful,
the effect of Folly is to leave a Gene∣ration
of Fools.</P>
<P>IT would be happy, if after having said
thus much in general, and after having enter'd
so seriously into all the Particulars by which
a lewd Generation defile and pollute the Mar∣riage
Bed, and ruin both themselves and their
Posterity, I could propose some effectual Me∣thod
for the suppressing the wicked Practices,
<PB N="400" REF="416"/>
and bring Mankind to live, at least like
reasonable Creatures, if not as Christians.</P>
<P>THE Answer to this would be direct, if
Laws and Government were concerned in it.
But as we complain of an Evil which the
sense of GOD'S Laws, nor the force of human
Laws, will not reach, nothing of Force, no∣thing
of putting Statutes in execution, no∣thing
of the Hand of the Magistrate can be
thought of use, or, if it be, will be equally
laugh'd at. Indeed, how should they that
can Argue themselves out of all the Re∣straints
of Virtue and Religion, be expected
to be under any Restraints, except those of
Power?</P>
<P>AND this makes me have recourse to Sa∣tyr,
and the Reproofs and Lashes of the Pen.
These are the proper Weapons to combat
this Adversary: Where the Laws of GOD or
Man have no Effect, the Satyr has been
sometimes known to reach the Affections and
Passions of Men; as they run in several
Channels, so they are to be come at by se∣veral
Methods; Ways and Means for one
Thing will not be always Ways and Means
for another; as Men are wrought upon,
some by one Thing, some by another, ac∣cording
to the several Tempers and Disposi∣tions
which govern them, and in which they
act; so, in general, they are mov'd, some in
one Way, some in another.</P>
<P>NATIONAL Mistakes, vulgar Errors, and
even a general Practice, have been reform'd
by a just Satyr. None of our Countrymen
have been known to boast of being <HI>True-Born
English-Men,</HI> or so much as to use the
Word as a Title or Appellation ever since a late
<PB N="401" REF="417"/>
<HI>Satyr</HI> upon that National Folly was pub∣lish'd,
tho' almost Forty Years ago. Nothing
was more frequent in our Mouths <HI>before</HI> that,
nothing so universally Blush'd for and laugh'd
at <HI>since.</HI> The Time, I believe, is yet to come,
that any Author printed it, or that any Man
of Sense spoke it in earnest; whereas, before
you had it in the best Writers, and in the
most florid Speeches, before the most august As∣semblies,
upon the most solemn Occasions.</P>
<P>COULD the Practice complain'd of in this
Work, ten thousand times more scandalous,
grown up to be odious and shameless; to wise
Men hateful, and to good Men horrid, I
mean that of talking lewdly, be hiss'd out of
the World by a just Satyr; could it be lash'd off
the Stage of Life by the Pen, happy would the
Author be that could boast of such Success.</P>
<P>COULD all the <HI>Third</HI> Chapter, and the
<HI>Fourth</HI> Chapter, and the <HI>Fifth,</HI> and <HI>Seventh,</HI> and
<HI>Ninth,</HI> and <HI>Eleventh</HI> Chapter-Crimes, be met
with in the same Manner, and with the same
Success, I should think this, however difficult,
the best and happiest Undertaking that ever
came into, or went out of my Hands.</P>
<P>I cannot desire a greater Scope in any Sub∣ject,
that calls for Censure among Men; I
think I may say, I must have all the Wise,
the Religious, the modest Part of Mankind
with me, in the Reproof. The Crimes I at∣tack
are not only Offences against Heaven,
but against all good Men, against Society,
against Humanity, against Virtue, against
Reason, and, in some Things, against Na∣ture;
Crimes that modest Words cannot (with∣out
great difficulty) explain, modest Tongues
<PB N="402" REF="418"/>
express, nor modest Ears, without, blushing<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hear
mentioned.</P>
<P>AS no sober Mind can receive the Ideas of
them, without entertaining the utmost Aver∣sion
to the Facts; so none that ever I met
with, that had any common share of Breed∣ing
and Manners, could bear the mention of
them, especially in the common Dialect of
those I call the Criminals.</P>
<P>NONE but a Set of People with Faces of
Steel, who can triumph in their Victory over
Religion, Conscience, and the Thoughts of
Eternity, that have got the Better both of Edu∣cation,
and of all Manner of Principles. These
may Glory indeed in their Shame; and
these are the People our Satyr desires to
expose.</P>
<P>AS to their Persons, nothing but universal
Contempt of them can have any Effect; no∣thing
can assist them to Blush but a gene∣ral
Hiss from Mankind, and being thrust off
the Stage by the very worst of Men. I
have heard it was the Foundation of a very
scandalous vicious Person's Reformation, when
another more notorious Fellow than himself,
reprov'd him in this Manner: <HI>Fie,</HI> Jack, <HI>why
thou art worse than I am.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are so many Lives of Crime, which
yet come short of these lawful Sinners, that
a Thief, a Drunkard, a Swearer, a Profligate,
may come to a Man talking—, as I
have mentioned, and say, Fie, Mr. <HI>G</HI>—,
Fie, Mr. <HI>H</HI>—, Fie, Mr. <HI>L</HI>—, <HI>Why,
you are worse than I am.</HI></P>
<P>WHY may we not hope to see the Time,
when the worst of common Offenders shall stop
<PB N="403" REF="419"/>
their Ears at the Wickedness of these, and
when the very Scandals of the Times shall
Blush for, and reprove them. This universal
Contempt of them; this general Aversion, if any
Thing on Earth can work upon them, will have
some Effect; there are few guilty Men har∣den'd
against the Battery of general Clamour;
it seems to be an Assault to be resisted only
by Innocence; Crime must certainly fall
under it; Innocence may hold up the
Head in such a Storm; but Guilt will cer∣tainly
and soon founder, and suffer Ship∣wreck.</P>
<P>INDEED, there seems to be some affinity
in Crime, between the People who We are now
Censuring, and another horrid modern Genera∣tion
too vile to name, and yet who seems
to be seeking Protection under these. There
may be indeed an essential Difference; but in
what small and minute Articles does it exist?
But as the Particulars will not admit a nearer
Enquiry, I think the better Way is to reject
both with Contempt, with an Abhorrence suit∣able
to the vileness of the Facts, and cast
them out together.</P>
<P>THIS will aid the modest Part of the World
in their just Opposition to all Indecency;
and if we did nothing else, our Work would
recommend itself to that Part of Mankind
which are really most valuable; and as for
the rest, let them act as they please, their
Approbation will add no Credit to the
Cause.</P>
<P>I have now done. I have said not all I
had to say, but all I have Room to say here;
and having brought the very Conclusion to
a Close, I would only add one Thing by
<PB N="404" REF="420"/>
way of Challenge to that Part of Mankind,
who I may have touch'd in this Satyr, and
who, for ought I know, may be angry; for,
indeed, they have nothing else left for it, but
to be angry, and rail at the Reproof; ac∣cording
to a known Distich used upon a like
Occasion:
<Q><L>That Disputants, when Reasons fail,</L>
<L>Have one sure Refuge left, and that's to Rail.</L></Q></P>
<P>NOW in this Case, I say, I have a fair Offer to
make to those Gentlemen in a few Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. LET them prove that the Fact here repre∣hended
is not in being; that 'tis all a Fiction or
Shadow, a Man of Straw; that there's nothing
in it, and that I am in the wrong. Or,</P>
<P>2. THAT if it is in being, that tho' the Fact
is true, and tho' such Things are done, they merit
no Satyr, that they ought not to be reproved or
exposed; I say, let them do this, and then they
shall Rail their fill, and treat Me, and the Work
which I have just now finished, in as scandalous
a manner as they please. Or,</P>
<P>3. Which I had much rather they should do,
let them REFORM; take the hint, fall under
the Reproof, and at once sink the Crime.</P>
<P>I confess, it seems rational that one or other
of these should be done: The two first, which
are in some respect the same, I am out of fear
of; the last seems a Debt; 'tis just I should de∣mand
it; let them repel the Charge, or re∣form
the Practice.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="421"/>
IF they cannot do the first, and yet contemn
the last, I declare War against them; and if I
live to appear again in the Field, let them ex∣pect
no Quarter; for the Satyr has not spent all
its Artillery, or shot all its Shafts. My next
Attack shall be personal, and I may come to
Black Lists, Histories of Facts, Registers of
Time, with Name and Sirname; for no Man
sure, in a Christian Government, as this is,
need be afraid of laying Hell open, or draw∣ing
the Pictures of Men when they are turn'd
Devils.</P>
<P>I might say a Word or two more with respect
to Style. I think I can have given no Offence
in Decency of Expression: If any Thing has,
notwithstanding the utmost Care, slipt my Pen,
let it be a Defence, that I profess it is unde∣sign'd;
the whole Tenour of the Work is cal∣culated
to bear down Vice, vitious Practises and
vitious Language; and, I think, I may claim
a favourable Construction where there seems a
Fault, if it were really a slip of the Pen: I
may claim it as a Debt due to a modest Inten∣tion;
declaring again, there is not one Word
willingly pass'd over that can be Censured, as
evidently leading to or encouraging Indecency,
no not in Thought. An evil Mind may cor∣rupt
the chastest Design; as in reading the ex∣planation
of the Words <HI>I WILL,</HI> in the Mar∣riage
Covenant, which, I say, is a solemn Oath,
and that as plain as if it had been express'd, as
swearing by the Name of GOD. Sure none can
be offended as if I put the sacred Name of GOD
into the Mouths of the Readers upon a light
Occasion, making them take the Name of GOD
in vain, or making them repeat an Oath in the
most vulgar and coursest way. But if any Man
<PB N="406" REF="422"/>
should be so weak, not to say malicious, let
them know, that I think the Expression car∣ries
with it a due reverence of the Name of
GOD; and that the Occasion is awful and so∣lemn;
and if I had said, <HI>So help me,</HI> GOD, it
had been the same thing: The meaning is, to
convince Men that how flight however they
pass over the Marriage Covenant, it is a solemn
Appeal to GOD for the Truth of the Intention;
and a solemn binding themselves in his Name
and Presence, to a strict Performance of the
Conditions; and that he that breaks them breaks
a most sacred Oath, and is as much Perjured as
if he had been so in the ordinary Form.</P>
