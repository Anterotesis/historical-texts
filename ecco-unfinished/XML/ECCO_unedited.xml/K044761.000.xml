<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II KINGS, Chap. IV. Ver. 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Thou hast been careful for us, with all this Care, what is to be done for thee?—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE more we consider the great Duty of doing Good to others the stronger we find our Obligations to perform it; to which we have this quickening Motive, that whilst we are acting for their Benefit we are certainly promoting our own Happiness: For we cannot give a more sensible Delight to our own unprejudiced Minds than by advancing the Welfare of Mankind, which is no other than employing some of the best and most di∣stinguished Qualities of our Nature on proper and becoming Objects. A Neglect therefore of this Duty must always be attended with Misery, as it is a Restraint upon the Faculties, and a Departure from the Glory, of our Nature.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<P>AGAIN, We promote our own Happiness by doing Good to others not only in acting agree∣ably to our Nature but in following the Ex∣ample of the great Author of it. It is a Re∣flection that will warm the Heart of every good Man to think that he can copy, though it be very faintly, one of the glorious Attributes of the supreme Being, who certainly, however necessary his Bounty may be for the Service of his Creatures, or the Manifestation of his own Glory, does intend that it shall have ano∣ther Effect, and raise our Imitation; that we shall be instructed as often as we are assisted, and make it an invariable Rule <HI>freely to give to others as we ourselves have freely received.</HI> We cannot suppose a more reasonable Cause of true Joy than an Opportunity afforded us wherein we may imitate the heavenly Example, and a Consciousness that we have endeavoured to make the best Use of it. This Thought, how∣ever, will carry a wise Man no farther than to give him Spirits to preserve the Character, to lead him to do Good in spite of Calumny and Opposition, and to labour that this Image of
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>God may be wrought in his Heart, against all Attempts from Custom, Sense, or Sollicitation, to deface it.</P>
<P>WE are assuredly also encreasing our own Happiness when we are doing Good to others inasmuch as we then act in strict Obedience to the Will of God. True Wisdom, in whatever Terms it is set forth, or under what Figures soever it is represented, is the Knowledge of the Will of God. The more we have of that Knowledge the wiser we are, and the more we practise what we know the happier we are. This is the only Wisdom that can give <HI>Length of Days; her Ways alone are the Ways of Pleasantness, and there is no Peace but in her Paths.</HI> We are happy, therefore, when we do Good, because we then walk in the Paths of true Wisdom; or, in other Words, because we faithfully observe the Will, and obey the Com∣mands, of an allwise and almighty Law-giver.</P>
<P>BUT, above all, it must be confessed that we do truly and sensibly promote our own Hap∣piness
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>by Acts of Charity and Benevolence, if we <HI>have Respect unto the Recompence of Reward,</HI> which is sometimes experienced in this Life, but is promised to the next on such Authority that the very Assurance is superior to any thing we can at present enjoy. Interest then, a lau∣dable Motive where such Means are used, and such an End proposed, compels us to the Ex∣ercise of Charity, teaching us that a Gift of that Sort is but <HI>lending unto the Lord;</HI> that it will be paid again into our Bosom, <HI>with good Measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</HI></P>
<P>IN this happy State of Mind let us cast our Eyes towards the Regions of Distress, and see what a Variety of Objects press forward to be relieved: A Variety that will exercise every Disposition that is humane and generous, and, at the same Time, severely reproach all those who are wholly governed by the confined Prin∣ciples of Partiality and Self-love.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<P>THE OBJECTS which call us now together appear among the foremost in this sorrowful Train; the one Part in the Character of depen∣dant Age, the other of helpless Youth: The Children, by innocent Silence, tenderly bespeak∣ing our Compassion toward themselves; the Mother, with heart-piercing Anguish, mourn∣fully pleading for our Assistance to herself and her distressed Little Ones.</P>
<P>IT is impossible, on an Occasion of this pub∣lic Nature, to avoid taking Notice of the un∣common Spirit of Charity that hath diffused it∣self, within these few Years, through the King∣dom, but hath more particularly appeared in this City, by many new Establishments suited to the Wants and Distresses of the People. <HI>We wish them good Luck, in the Name of the Lord.</HI> May every Design flourish which is intended for the Service of Society, and the Honour of God! And may this excellent Institution, which first led the way, still maintain its Credit and Ac∣count; be looked upon, if I may so speak, as the Mother-Charity; be entitled to the general
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>Regard, and ever partake of the Bounty of all those who love and believe in the Gospel of Peace!</P>
<P>THE Spirit which hath been shewn in the Support of this great and good Work, and the yearly-encreasing Benefactions prove the Excel∣lence and Propriety of it; and truly we cannot suppose a more general, or a more deserving Object of Regard, than the Widows and Or∣phans of those who have spent their Lives in promoting the true Happiness of Mankind, by preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation. — If we have been made sensible of the Greatness of that Happiness; if we have been taught how we may obtain it; if we have been instructed how to guard against those Enemies who would oppose that Pursuit; if we have had our Minds enlarged, our Hearts set at ease, or our Spirits raised to the Exercise of heavenly Virtues; and This by the Diligence and Fidelity of those Mi∣nisters who are set over us, or by the Works of those who have heretofore laboured in the Lord, who, being dead, yet speak, Here are we to
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>shew forth the Spirit of our Gratitude; Here are we to confess the Benefits we have received: This is the Altar of Thanksgiving; of Thanks∣giving, not to the weak and unprofitable Ser∣vants, but to the great Lord of all who is of∣tentimes pleased to cut short the Lives of some of them, in order to prove the Degree of our Love and Charity, and to see how far our As∣sistance will extend in supplying the Wants and Necessities of those who represent them.</P>
<P>THAT we may do this more effectually, let us take a nearer View of their Circumstances.</P>
<P>NOTHING makes Misery so sharp as the Sud∣denness of it. It never presses so hard as when it immediately succeeds a State of Ease or Enjoy∣ment. The Persons, whose Case is under our present Consideration, are, in general, the ful∣lest Instances of the Deepness of Distress: For before their Trouble comes upon them, even whilst it is hanging over their Heads, you will see the whole House chearful, contented, easy, beloved, and respected; in a Word, the Object
<PB N="12" REF="10"/>of envied Happiness; the one Parent exercised in forming the Morals of his Children, improv∣ing their Understandings, and leading them by gentle Steps into the Knowledge of their Du∣ty in all its Branches, to God, to the King, to their Country, to themselves, to their Rela∣tions, and to Mankind; the Other employed in the no less necessary Duties of domestic Life; Both jointly acting for the good of all, and with parental Affection, not to be expressed, anti∣cipating Schemes of future Prosperity. With these Family-Cares you find the Father main∣taining his public Station by a faithful Dis∣charge of all its Offices, supporting the Digni∣ty of his Function with Honour and Esteem: From Education taught to be generous; from Profession to be charitable; especially the hearty, and, according to his Abilities, the libe∣ral Friend of this Institution. When, Oh! hard to be experienced, some fatal Disease (fre∣quently the Effect of a too anxious Concern for the Welfare and Happiness of those who are so dear to him) puts an End to This Neces∣sary Life, and changes, at once, the little hap∣py
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>Dwelling into a House of Mourning and Mi∣sery: Of Misery indeed, when that Provision is taken away which should support; and he is cut off who should direct this Infant-Com∣munity. A Scene this, which will draw the Tear of Pity from every Eye; in which it is hard to say, whether are the more affecting Objects, the elder Children who can feel their Misfortune; or the younger who, by Uncon∣cernedness and Disregard, shew they are alto∣gether insensible of it. But Her melancholy Situation most of all will move our Hearts to Compassion, who not only knows and feels her present Affliction, but is overwhelmed at the Thought of what may hereafter happen from the helpless and distressed Condition of herself and of her Children. And if our Passions lead us to sympathize with the Widow in her Grief, our Experience and Knowledge in the World will inform us that her Fears are too well grounded; that severe is their Lot, who, by losing their Friend and Guide, have a dark and intricate Path to pursue; which they, who have the greatest Helps and Encouragements,
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>find it difficult to keep, and which must conse∣quently be highly dangerous and perplexed to those who are uncounselled and unassisted.</P>
<P>HITHER then let Charity, that amiable Chris∣tian Grace, bring her well-timed Means; hi∣ther hasten with Relief to those, who so tru∣ly deserve it. Let her comfort them, when deceitful Friends turn away their Face; and cherish them under the malignant Scorn of those who hold Poverty a Reproach: Let her teach them that there is a God who careth for the Needy; and instruct them to behave with Diligence, Honesty, and Humility in the Stations that are assigned them; in full As∣surance that the Adversity which they have experienced in their early Years will, by those Means, be converted into Joy and Happiness at the last.</P>
<P>THE Zeal which some Persons have exerted in this excellent Work, the Discretion and Judgment of others, and the beneficent Spirit of many more, have oftentimes produced this
<PB N="15" REF="13"/>happy Effect; have turned Sorrow into Joy; out of Weakness have raised Strength; and from destitute, though well-principled Children, have enriched the Common-wealth with honest and useful Members. Can any Considerations find a readier Way to your Heart than these? Can your Passions be more warmly worked upon, or your Reason more fully satisfied, than by an Application of this kind, in Behalf of a Chari∣ty so well calculated and conducted as the pre∣sent which by its Objects properly exercises your Pity and Benevolence; by its Oeconomy gives Complacency to the Mind; and by its Effects affords real, lasting, and universal Ad∣vantage?</P>
<P>THUS every Motive that can affect us pleads for its Encouragement. Nature points to it, entreating us not to forget the Miseries of our Fellow-Creatures; Religion holds it up to our View, and commands us to remember Christ's Little Ones; and Society attests the Usefulness of it by assuring us that it will in∣crease her Glory and Strength.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="14"/>
<P>THERE is another very powerful Considera∣tion which will have its Weight with us, as in Truth it-ought to have in all Designs that are well intended and faithfully executed: This is suggested to us by that Scripture of which the Text is a Part, and in which the Prophet <HI>Elisha</HI> makes a signal Return to certain Hospi∣table Treatment that had been shewn to him; thereby expressing the Favour which God Al∣mighty bears to those who pay Regard to the Wants of his Servants.</P>
<P>IT were unnecessary to be particular on a Sto∣ry so well known. It will be sufficient to ob∣serve that there are two or three Circum∣stances which agree with this Design, from whence we may reasonably hope, the Encoura∣gers of it, they who <HI>have been careful for us with all this Care,</HI> may also meet with their Reward.</P>
<P>WE observe then that these Contributions, like the Services of the <HI>Shunamite,</HI> are a free and
<PB N="17" REF="15"/>voluntary Act, springing from a fixed Principle of Goodness, from a Desire to give Glory to God and to assist those who are in Necessity; and again, that, the Dispositions being alike, the Objects also are in both Cases nearly the same; for she, like the first Promoters of this good Work, thought that the Wants of God's Ministers and Servants deserved Relief, that it were inexcusable not to attend to them, and that they whose sole Employment it is to ad∣minister Spiritual Things should, in return, receive Temporal.</P>
<P>THERE is another similar Circumstance which we remark in the Passage before us, namely, that the good Offices, to which the Prophet, through the Power of God, made so ample a Return, were of small Consideration, nothing more than a few Conveniencies, and some occasional Acts of Hospitality. Here too, we confess, the Parallel holds; for though your Zeal hath been warm, and your Benefac∣tions liberal; yet, from the great Number of Objects which annually apply, the Relief af∣forded
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>is but inconsiderable; especially to one Part of them whose Provision bears no Propor∣tion to their Wants.</P>
<P>IT hath pleased God to put it into the Heart of some excellent Person to consider more attentively the Circumstances of the Widows, and on conditional, but generous and well-judged Terms, to advance a Sum towards the Increase of their Stipend. This charitable Spi∣rit, though lately shewn, hath already had its Influence, and we pray to God that it may increase to the Comfort of those who have at once to struggle with Age and Necessity.</P>
<P>BUT though we cannot relieve all in the Manner we desire; yet He, who is to judge and to reward, hath promised to accept our best Endeavours. It is the Good Will that is pleasing to him; it is the Chearfulness attend∣ing our Offering, which is his Delight. When we give honestly, that is, use no false Reasons, nor frame selfish Excuses to diminish our Dis∣tributions; when, in short, we fairly do all
<PB N="19" REF="17"/>we can in this Cause, then our Little becomes Great, then may we look for a Recompence, for this is <HI>the Cup of cold Water,</HI> which who∣soever faithfully dispenses, the Son of God hath declared, <HI>shall in no wise lose his Reward.</HI></P>
<P>ALAS! in what wretched Circumstance must they stand whom this divine Assurance cannot affect; who regard no one but them∣selves, and feel no Necessities but their own!</P>
<P>IT was the good Disposition of the Per∣son applied to in the Text, that gained her a Reward, and it was the Object towards whom that Disposition was shewn, which made that Reward so great. She offered a Sacrifice to God, small indeed, but of so sweet a smelling Savour, and he repaid it an hundred fold, by a Gift that of all others she desired, which she preferred, we find, to all the Favours that Power, nay, that Majesty, could bestow; for her Reward was that in which her Soul de∣lighted, a Son of her Age, who was sent her in due time; and after he was grown up and
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>had met his Death by some Accident or Dis∣ease, was raised from the Dead, and restored to her again.</P>
<P>HERE then is the Force of the Application, — If we bear the same charitable Spirit, and if it be as religiously directed, may we not hope, from the experienced Goodness of God, <HI>who is not unrighteous that he will for∣get our Works and Labour</HI> that <HI>proceedeth of Love,</HI> that he will also reward us, that he will <HI>be merciful unto us, that he will bless us, and lift up the Light of his Countenance up∣on us?</HI></P>
<P>IT seems necessary, in this Place, to take one Caution along with us, which is, that we are not too sanguine in our Expectations; nor imagine, that the Reward of our good Works shall be immediately suited to our present In∣clinations; since it is much to be doubted, from the Prejudice by which we are apt to judge and choose in those Cases, whether such a Re∣compence would turn to our real Advantage.
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>We pay our Offering to God, and it is from him we hope for a Return; but it will never become us to prescribe either the Manner or the Degree of it; We must wait his Pleasure and acquiesce in all his Dispensations, fully persuaded of this sacred Truth, that all our Services and good Offices are best recommend∣ed and sanctified by Resignation and Humility.</P>
<P>IN these Thoughts, and with these Encou∣ragements let us go on with this Labour of Love till the Success of it be equal to the Excel∣lence. It is a glorious, it is a Christian Un∣dertaking; let us therefore recommend it, as Christians ought to do, by the persuasive Ex∣ample of our Liberality, for by such Means we most effectually express our Zeal for its Honour and Prosperity: Especially let Those, who are solely respected in it, be first among the Promoters of it; It is in their Power to become truly so, by adding to their Charity every other Virtue; this will bring Glory to the Work, and convince our Enemies, that it provides for the destitute Families of honest and
<PB N="22" REF="20"/>good Men—And let them pray, yea let them teach their Children to do the same, that God would be pleased to prosper this charitable De∣sign and to bless the Friends and Benefactors of it: Or, if in his Providence, he shall think fit to afflict them, or their Posterity, as those, now before us, are afflicted, that he would give them Resolution and Patience, the great Support of distressed Virtue, and the promised Reward of that beneficent Spirit, which is exercised in <HI>providing</HI> for <HI>the Fatherless and in healing the broken hearted.</HI></P>
<P>MAY that God, <HI>who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask, or think,</HI> hear these Petitions; and bestow all his Blessings up∣on us in such a Manner, as his unnerring Wisdom shall judge most conducive to our Happiness and his Glory!</P>
