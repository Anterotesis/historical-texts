<L N="30">Rejudge his acts, and dignify disgrace.</L>
<L>When Int'rest calls off all her sneaking train,</L>
<L>And all the oblig'd desert, and all the vain;</L>

<HEAD>EPISTLE To Mr. JERVAS, With Mr. DRYDEN'S Translation of FRESNOY'S Art of Painting.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THIS Verse be thine, my friend, nor thou refuse</L>
<L>This, from no venal or ungrateful Muse.</L>
<L>Whether thy hand strike out some free design,</L>
<L>Where Life awakes, and dawns at ev'ry line;</L>
<L N="5">Or blend in beauteous tints the colour'd mass,</L>
<L>And from the canvas call the mimic face:</L>
<L>Read these instructive leaves, in which conspire</L>
<L>Fresnoy's close Art, and Dryden's native Fire:</L>
<L>And reading wish, like theirs, our fate and fame,</L>
<L N="10">So mix'd our studies, and so join'd our name;</L>
<L>Like them to shine thro' long succeeding age,</L>
<L>So just thy skill, so regular my rage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="46" REF="54"/>
<L>Smit with the love of Sister-Arts we came,</L>
<L>And met congenial, mingling flame with flame;</L>
<L N="15">Like friendly colours found them both unite,</L>
<L>And each from each contract new strength and light.</L>
<L>How oft' in pleasing tasks we wear the day,</L>
<L>While summer-suns roll unperceiv'd away?</L>
<L>How oft' our slowly-growing works impart,</L>
<L N="20">While Images reflect from art to art?</L>
<L>How oft' review; each finding like a friend</L>
<L>Something to blame, and something to commend?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What flatt'ring scenes our wand'ring fancy wrought,</L>
<L>Rome's pompous glories rising to our thought!</L>
<L N="25">Together o'er the Alps methinks we fly,</L>
<L>Fir'd with Ideas of fair Italy.</L>
<L>With thee, on Raphael's Monument I mourn,</L>
<L>Or wait inspiring Dreams at Maro's Urn:</L>
<L>With thee repose, where Tully once was laid,</L>
<L N="30">Or seek some Ruin's formidable shade,</L>
<L>While fancy brings the vanish'd piles to view,</L>
<L>And builds imaginary Rome a-new,</L>
<L>Here thy well-study'd marbles fix our eye;</L>
<L>A fading Fresco here demands a sigh:</L>
<L N="35"><PB N="47" REF="55"/>
Each heav'nly piece unwearied we compare,</L>
<L>Match Raphael's grace with thy lov'd Guido's air,</L>
<L>Carracci's strength, Correggio's softer line,</L>
<L>Paulo's free stroke, and Titian's warmth divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How finish'd with illustrious toil appears</L>
<L>This small, well-polish'd Gem, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fresnoy employed above twenty Years in finishing his Poem. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>work of years!</L>
<L N="41">Yet still how faint by precept is exprest</L>
<L>The living image in the painter's breast?</L>
<L>Thence endless streams of fair Ideas flow,</L>

<L N="45">Thence Beauty, waking all her forms, supplies</L>
<L>An Angel's sweetness, or Bridgewater's eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Muse! at that Name thy sacred sorrows shed,</L>
<L>Those tears eternal, that embalm the dead:</L>
<L>Call round her Tomb each object of desire,</L>
<L N="50">Each purer frame inform'd with purer fire:</L>
<L>Bid her be all that chears or softens life,</L>
<L>The tender sister, daughter, friend, and wife:</L>
<L>Bid her be all that makes mankind adore;</L>
<L>Then view this Marble, and be vain no more!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still her charms in breathing paint engage;</L>
<L N="56">Her modest cheek shall warm a future age.</L>
<L><PB N="48" REF="56"/>
Beauty, frail flow'r that ev'ry season fears,</L>
<L>Blooms in thy colours for a thousand years.</L>
<L>Thus Churchill's race shall other hearts surprize,</L>
<L N="60">And other Beauties envy Worsley's eyes;</L>
<L>Each pleasing Blount shall endless smiles bestow,</L>
<L>And soft Belinda's blush for ever glow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh lasting as those Colours may they shine,</L>
<L>Free as thy stroke, yet faultless as thy line;</L>
<L N="65">New graces yearly like thy works display,</L>
<L>Soft without weakness, without glaring gay;</L>
<L>Led by some rule, that guides, but not constrains;</L>
<L>And finish'd more thro' happiness than pains.</L>
<L>The kindred Arts shall in their praise conspire,</L>
<L N="70">One dip the pencil, and one string the lyre.</L>
<L>Yet should the Graces all thy figures place,</L>
<L>And breath an air divine on ev'ry face;</L>
<L>Yet should the Muses bid my numbers roll</L>
<L>Strong as their charms, and gentle as their soul;</L>
<L N="75">With Zeuxis' Helen thy Bridgwater vie,</L>
<L>And these be sung 'till Granville's Myra die:</L>
<L>Alas! how little from the grave we claim!</L>
<L>Thou but preserv'st a Face, and I a Name.</L>

<HEAD>EPISTLE To Miss BLOUNT, With the WORKS of VOITURE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN these gay thoughts the Loves and Graces shine,</L>
<L>And all the Writer lives in ev'ry line;</L>
<L>His easy Art may happy Nature seem,</L>
<L>Trifles themselves are elegant in him.</L>
<L N="5">Sure to charm all was his peculiar fate,</L>
<L>Who without flatt'ry pleas'd the fair and great;</L>
<L>Still with esteem no less convers'd than read;</L>
<L>With wit well-natur'd, and with books well-bred:</L>
<L>His heart, his mistress, and his friend did share,</L>
<L N="10">His time, the Muse, the witty, and the fair.</L>
<L>Thus wisely careless, innocently gay,</L>
<L>Chearful he play'd the trifle, Life, away;</L>
<L>'Till fate scarce felt his gentle breath supprest,</L>
<L>As smiling Infants sport themselves to rest.</L>
<L N="15">Ev'n rival Wits did Voiture's death deplore,</L>
<L>And the gay mourn'd who never mourn'd before;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="58"/>
The truest hearts for Voiture heav'd with sighs,</L>
<L>Voiture was wept by all the brightest Eyes:</L>
<L>The Smiles and Loves had dy'd in Voiture's death,</L>
<L N="20">But that for ever in his lines they breathe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let the strict life of graver mortals be</L>
<L>A long, exact, and serious Comedy;</L>
<L>In ev'ry scene some Moral let it teach,</L>
<L>And, if it can, at once both please and preach.</L>
<L N="25">Let mine, an innocent gay farce appear,</L>
<L>And more diverting still than regular,</L>
<L>Have Humour, Wit, a native Ease and Grace,</L>
<L>Tho' not too strictly bound to Time and Place:</L>
<L>Critics in Wit, or Life, are hard to please,</L>
<L N="30">Few write to those, and none can live to these.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too much your Sex is by their forms confin'd,</L>
<L>Severe to all, but most to Womankind;</L>
<L>Custom, grown blind with Age, must be your guide;</L>
<L>Your pleasure is a vice, but not your pride;</L>
<L N="35">By Nature yielding, stubborn but for fame;</L>
<L>Made Slaves by honour, and made Fools by shame.</L>
<L>Marriage may all those petty Tyrants chase,</L>
<L>But sets up one, a greater in their place;</L>
<L>Well might you wish for change by those accurst,</L>
<L N="40">But the last Tyrant ever proves the worst.</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="59"/>
Still in constraint your suff'ring Sex remains,</L>
<L>Or bound in formal, or in real chains:</L>
<L>Whole years neglected, for some months ador'd,</L>
<L>The fawning Servant turns a haughty Lord.</L>
<L N="45">Ah quit not the free innocence of life,</L>
<L>For the dull glory of a virtuous Wife;</L>
<L>Nor let false Shews, or empty Titles please:</L>
<L>Aim not at Joy, but rest content with Ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Gods, to curse Pamela with her pray'rs,</L>
<L>Gave the gilt Coach and dappled Flanders Mares,</L>
<L N="51">The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state,</L>
<L>And, to compleat her bliss, a Fool for Mate.</L>
<L>She glares in Balls, front Boxes, and the Ring,</L>
<L>A vain, unquiet, glitt'ring, wretched Thing!</L>
<L>Pride, Pomp, and State but reach her outward part;</L>
<L N="56">She sighs, and is no Duchess at her heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, Madam, if the fates withstand, and you</L>
<L>Are destin'd Hymen's willing Victim too;</L>
<L>Trust not too much your now resistless charms,</L>
<L N="60">Those, Age or Sickness, soon or late, disarms:</L>
<L>Good humour only teaches charms to last,</L>
<L>Still makes new conquests, and maintains the past;</L>
<L>Love, rais'd on Beauty, will like that decay,</L>
<L>Our hearts may bear its slender chain a day;</L>
<L N="65"><PB N="52" REF="60"/>
As flow'ry bands in wantonness are worn,</L>
<L>A morning's pleasure, and at evening torn;</L>
<L>This binds in ties more easy, yet more strong,</L>
<L>The willing heart, and only holds it long.</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mademoiselle Paulet. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>Voiture's early care still shone the same,</L>

<L>Some Squire, perhaps, you take delight to rack;</L>

<L>Whose laughs are hearty, tho' his jests are coarse,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>In some fair ev'ning, on your elbow laid,</L>

<L>In pensive thought recall the fancy'd scene,</L>

While the spread fan o'ershades your closing eyes;</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>So when your Slave, at some dear idle time,</L>

<L>Stands in the streets, abstracted from the crew,</L>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Reign of Queen ANNE, (which, not∣withstanding those happy Times which suc∣ceeded, every Englishman may remember) thou may'st possibly, gentle Reader, have seen a certain venerable Person who frequented the out∣side of the Palace of St. James's, and who, by the Gravity of his Deportment and Habit, was gene∣rally taken for a decay'd Gentleman of Spain. His stature was tall, his visage long, his complexion olive, his brows were black and even, his eyes hollow yet piercing, his nose inclin'd to aquiline, his beard neglected and mix'd with grey: All this contributed to spread a solemn Melancholy over his countenance. Pythagoras was not more silent, Pyrrho more motionless, nor Zeno more austere. His Wig was as black and smooth as the plumes of a Raven, and hung as strait as the hair of a River God rising from the water. His Cloak so com∣pleatly covered his whole person, that whether or no he had any other cloaths (much less any lin∣nen) under it, I shall not say; but his sword ap∣pear'd a full yard behind him, and his manner of
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
wearing it was so stiff, that it seem'd grown to his Thigh. His whole figure was so utterly unlike any thing of this world, that it was not natural for any man to ask him a question without bless∣ing himself first. Those who never saw a <HI>Jesuit,</HI> took him for one, and others believed him some <HI>High Priest of the Jews.</HI></P>
<P>But under this macerated form was conceal'd a Mind replete with Science, burning with a zeal of benefiting his fellow-creatures, and filled with an honest conscious pride, mixt with a scorn of doing, or suffering the least thing beneath the dig∣nity of a Philosopher. Accordingly he had a soul that would not let him accept of any offers of Charity, at the same time that his body seem'd but too much to require it. His lodging was in a small chamber up four pair of stairs, where he re∣gularly payed for what he had when he eat or drank; and he was often observed wholly to ab∣stain from both. He declined speaking to any one, except the Queen, or her first Minister, to whom he attempted to make some applications; but his real business or intentions were utterly unknown to all men. Thus much is certain, that he was ob∣noxious to the Queen's Ministry; who, either out of Jealousy or Envy, had him spirited away, and carried abroad as a dangerous person, without any regard to the known Laws of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>One day, as this Gentleman was walking about dinner-time alone in the Mall, it happened that a
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
Manuscript dropt from under his cloak, which my servant pick'd up, and brought to me. It was written in the Latin tongue, and contain'd many most profound secrets, in an unusual turn of rea∣soning and style. The first leaf was inscribed with these words, <HI>Codicillus, seu Liber Memorialis, Mar∣tini Scribleri.</HI> The Book was of so wonderful a nature, that it is incredible what a desire I con∣ceived that moment to be acquainted with the Author, who I clearly perceived was some great Philosopher in disguise. I several times endea∣voured to speak to him, which he as often in∣dustriously avoided. At length I found an oppor∣tunity (as he stood under the Piazza by the Danc∣ing-room in St. James's) to acquaint him in the Latin tongue, that his Manuscript was fallen into my hands; and saying this, I presented it to him, with great Encomiums on the learned Author. Hereupon he took me aside, survey'd me over with a fixt attention, and opening the clasps of the Parchment cover, spoke (to my great surprize) in English, as follows:</P>
<P><Q>“Courteous stranger, whoever thou art, I em∣brace thee as my best friend; for either the Stars and my Art are deceitful, or the destin'd time is come which is to manifest Martinus Scriblerus to the world, and thou the person chosen by fate for this task. What thou seest in me is a body ex∣hausted by the labours of the mind. I have
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
found in Dame Nature not indeed an unkind, but a very coy Mistress: Watchful nights, anxi∣ous days, slender meals, and endless labours, must be the lot of all who pursue her, through her labyrinths and maeanders. My first vital air I drew in this Island (a soil fruitful of Philoso∣phers) but my complexion is become adust, and my body arid, by visiting lands (as the Poet has it) <HI>alio sub sole calentes.</HI> I have, through my whole life, passed under several disguises and un∣known names, to skreen myself from the envy and malice which mankind express against those who are possessed of the <HI>Arcanum Magnum.</HI> But at present I am forced to take Sanctuary in the British Court, to avoid the Revenge of a cruel Spaniard, who has pursued me almost through the whole terraqueous globe. Being about four years ago in the City of Madrid in quest of natu∣ral knowledge, I was informed of a Lady who was marked with a Pomegranate upon the in∣side of her right Thigh, which blossom'd, and, as it were, seem'd to ripen in the due season. Forthwith was I possessed with an insatiable cu∣riosity to view this wonderful Phaenomenon. I felt the ardour of my passion encrease as the sea∣son advanced, till, in the month of July, I could no longer contain. I bribed her Duenna, was admitted to the Bath, saw her undress'd, and the wonder displayed. This was soon after dis∣covered by the husband, who finding some let∣ters
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
I had writ to the Duenna, containing ex∣pressions of a doubtful meaning, suspected me of a crime most alien from the Purity of my Thoughts. Incontinently I left Madrid by the advice of friends, have been pursued, dogg'd, and way-laid through several Nations, and even now scarce think myself secure within the sacred walls of this Palace. It has been my good for∣tune to have seen all the grand Phaenomena of Nature, excepting an Earthquake, which I wait∣ed for in Naples three years in vain; and now by means of some British Ship (whose Colours no Spaniard dares approach <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This marks the time when the Introduction was written.</NOTE>) I impatiently expect a safe passage to Jamaica, for that benefit. To thee, my Friend, whom Fate has marked for my Historiographer, I leave these my Commenta∣ries, and others of my works. No more—be faithful and impartial.”</Q></P>
<P>He soon after performed his promise, and left me the Commentaries, giving me also further lights by many Conferences; when he was unfortunate∣ly snatched away (as I before related) by the jea∣lousy of the Queen's Ministry.</P>
<P>Tho' I was thus to my eternal grief deprived of his conversation, he for some years continued his Correspondence, and communicated to me many of his Projects for the benefit of mankind. He sent me some of his Writings, and recommended
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
to my care the recovery of others, stragling about the world, and assumed by other men. The last time I heard from him was on occasion of his Stri∣ctures on the Dunciad: since when, several years being elapsed, I have reason to believe this excel∣lent person is either dead, or carried by his vehe∣ment thirst of knowledge into some remote, or perhaps undiscovered Region of the world. In ei∣ther case, I think it a debt no longer to be delay∣ed, to reveal what I know of this Prodigy of Science, and to give the History of his life, and of his extensive merits to mankind; in which I dare promise the Reader, that, whenever he begins to think any one Chapter dull, the style will be im∣mediately changed in the next.</P>

<P>Of the Parentage and Family of Scriblerus, how he was begot, what Care was taken of him before he was born, and what Prodigies attended his Birth.</P>
<P>IN the City of Munster in Germany, lived a grave and learned Gentleman, by Profession an Antiquary; who, among all his invaluable Cu∣riosities, esteemed none more highly, than a Skin of the true Pergamenian Parchment, which hung at the upper-end of his hall. On this was curi∣ously
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
traced the ancient Pedigree of the <HI>Scribleri,</HI> with all their Alliances and collateral Relations (among which were reckoned Albertus Magnus, Paracelsus Bombastus, and the famous Scaligers in old time Princes of Verona) and deduced even from the Times of the Elder Pliny to Cornelius Scriblerus: For such was the name of this vene∣rable Personage; whose glory it was, that, by the singular Virtue of the Women, not one had a Head of a different Cast from his family.</P>
<P>His wife was a Lady of singular beauty, whom not for that reason only he espoused, but because she was undoubted daughter either of the great Scriverius, or of Gaspar Barthius. It happened on a time, the said Gaspar made a visit to Scrive∣rius at Harlem, taking with him a comely Lady
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
of his acquaintance, who was skilful in the Greek Tongue, of whom the learned Scriverius became so enamoured, as to inebriate his friend, and be fa∣miliar with his Mistress. I am not ignorant of what <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Columesius relates this from Isaac Vossius, in his Opuscul. p. 102. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>Columesius affirms, that the learned Bar∣thius was not so overtaken, but he perceived it; and in Revenge suffered this unfortunate Gentle∣woman to be drowned in the Rhine at her return. But Mrs. Scriblerus (the issue of that Amour) was a living proof of the falsehood of this Report. Dr. Cornelius was farther induced to his marriage, from the certain information that the aforesaid Lady, the mother of his wife, was related to Car∣dan on the father's side, and to Aldrovandus on the mother's: Besides which, her Ancestors had been professors of Physick, Astrology, or Che∣mistry, in German Universities, from generation to generation.</P>
<P>With this fair Gentlewoman had our Doctor lived in a comfortable Union for about ten years: But this our sober and orderly pair, without any natural infirmity, and with a constant and frequent compliance to the chief duty of conjugal life, were yet unhappy, in that Heaven had not blessed them with any issue. This was the utmost grief to the good man; especially considering what exact Pre∣cautions and Methods he had used to procure that Blessing: for he never had cohabitation with his
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
spouse, but he pondered on the Rules of the An∣cients, for the generation of Children of Wit. He ordered his diet according to the prescription of Galen, confining himself and his wife for almost the whole first year to <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Galen Lib. de Cibis boni et mali succi, cap. 3. P.</NOTE>Goat's Milk and Honey. It unfortunately befel her, when she was about four months gone with child, to long for some∣what, which that author inveighs against as preju∣dicial to the understanding of the infant. This her husband thought fit to deny her, affirming, it was better to be childless, than to become the Parent of a Fool. His Wife miscarried; but as the Abortion proved only a female Foetus, he com∣forted himself, that, had it arrived to perfection, it would not have answer'd his account; his heart being wholly fixed upon the learned Sex. How∣ever he disdained not to treasure up the Embryo in a Vial, among the curiosities of his family.</P>
<P>Having discovered that Galen's prescription could not determine the sex, he forthwith betook himself to Aristotle. Accordingly he with-held the nuptial embrace when the wind was in any point of the South; this <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Arist. xiv. Sect. Prob. 5. P.</NOTE>Author asserting that the grossness and moisture of the southerly winds oc∣casion the procreation of females, and not of males. But he redoubled his diligence when the wind was at West, a wind on which that great Philosopher bestowed the Encomiums of Fatner of the earth,
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
Breath of the Elysian Fields, and other glorious Elogies. For our learned man was clearly of opi∣nion, that the Semina out of which Animals are produced, are Animalcula ready formed, and re∣ceived in with the Air <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Religion of Nature, Sect. v. Parag. 15. P. The seriousness with which this strange opinion, on so mysterious a point, is ad∣vanced, very well deserved this stroke of ridicule.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Under these regulations, his wife, to his unex∣pressible joy, grew pregnant a second time; and, (what was no small addition to his happiness) he just then came to the possession of a considerable Estate by the death of her Uncle, a wealthy Jew who resided at London. This made it necessary for him to take a journey to England; nor would the care of his posterity let him suffer his Wife to remain behind him. During the voyage, he was perpetually taken up on the one hand, how to employ his great Riches; and on the other, how to educate his Child. He had already determined to set apart several annual Sums, for the recovery of <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> the effossion of <HI>Coins,</HI> the procur∣ing of <HI>Mummies;</HI> and for all those curious disco∣veries by which he hoped to become (as himself was wont to say) a second <HI>Peireskius</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">There was a great deal of trifling pedantry and curiosity in that great Man's character.</NOTE>. He had already chalked out all possible schemes for the im∣provement of a male child, yet was so far prepar'd for the worst that could happen, that before the nine months were expired, he had composed two

<P>This is all we can find relating to Martinus, while he was in his Mother's womb, excepting that he was entertained there with a Concert of Musick once in twenty four hours, according to the Custom of the Magi: and that on a <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ramsey's Cyrus. P. It was with judgment, that the Authors chose rather to ridicule the modern relator of this ridiculous prac∣tice, than the Ancients from whence he took it. As it is a sure instance of folly, when amongst the many excellent things that may be learned from antiquity, we find a modern writer only picking out their absurdities.</NOTE>particu∣lar day, he was observed to leap and kick exceed∣ingly, which was on the first of April, the birth∣day of the great <HI>Basilius Valentinus.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this, and every preceding Fact, may be depended upon, being taken literally from the Memoirs. But I must be so ingenuous as to own, that the Accounts are not so certain of the exact time and place of his birth. As to the first, he had the common frailty of old men, to conceal his age: as to the second, I only remember to have heard him say, that he first saw the light in St. Giles's Parish. But in the investigation of this point, For∣tune hath favoured our diligence. For one day as I was passing by the <HI>Seven Dials,</HI> I overheard a dispute concerning the place of Nativity of a great Astrologer, which each man alledged to have been in his own street. The circumstances of the time, and
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
the description the person, made me imagine it might be that universal Genius whose life I am writing. I returned home, and having maturely considered their several arguments, which I found to be of equal weight, I quieted my curiosity with this natural conclusion, that he was born in some point common to all the seven streets; which must be that on which the column is now erected. And it is with infinite pleasure that I since find my Con∣jecture confirmed, by the following passage in the Codicil to Mr. Neale's Will.</P>
<P>I appoint my Executors to engrave the following Inscription on the Column in the Centre of the seven streets which I erected.</P>
<P><Q><L>LOC. NAT. INCLVT. PHILOS. MAR. SCR.</L></Q>
But Mr. Neale's Order was never performed, be∣cause the Executors durst not administer.</P>
<P>Nor was the Birth of this great man unattend∣ed with Prodigies: He himself has often told me, that on the night before he was born, Mrs. Scrib∣lerus dream'd she was brought to bed of a huge <HI>Ink-horn,</HI> out of which issued several large streams of Ink, as it had been a fountain. This dream was by her husband thought to signify, that the child should prove a very voluminous Writer. Likewise a <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Virgil's Laurel. Donat. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Crab-tree</HI> that had been hitherto bar∣ren, appeared on a sudden laden with a vast quan∣tity
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
of Crabs: This sign also the old gentleman imagined to be a prognostic of the acuteness of his Wit. A great swarm of <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Plato, Lucan, etc. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE><HI>Wasps</HI> play'd round his Cradle without hurting him, but were very trou∣blesome to all in the room besides: This seemed a certain presage of the effects of his Satire. A Dunghill was seen within the space of one night to be covered all over with <HI>Mushrooms:</HI> This some interpreted to promise the infant great fertility of fancy, but no long duration to his works; but the Father was of another opinion.</P>
<P>But what was of all most wonderful, was a thing that seemed a monstrous <HI>Fowl,</HI> which just then dropt through the sky-light, near his wife's apartment. It had a large body, two little dispro∣portioned wings, a prodigious tail, but no head. As its colour was white, he took it at first sight for a Swan, and was concluding his son would be a Poet: but on a nearer view, he perceived it to be speckled with black, in the form of letters; and that it was indeed a Paper kite which had broke its leash by the impetuosity of the wind. His back was armed with the Art Military, his belly was filled with Physick, his wings were the wings of Quarles and Withers, the several Nodes of his voluminous tail were diversify'd with several branches of Science; where the Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of Logick, a knot of Meta∣physick, a knot of Casuistry, a knot of Polemical
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
Divinity, and a knot of Common Law, with a <HI>Lanthorn</HI> of <HI>Jacob Behmen.</HI></P>
<P>There went a Report in the family, that, as soon as he was born, he uttered the voice of nine seve∣ral animals: he cry'd like a Calf, bleated like a Sheep, chattered like a Mag-pye, grunted like a Hog, neighed like a Foal, croaked like a Raven, mewed like a Cat, gabbled like a Goose, and bray'd like an Ass. And the next morning he was found playing in his bed with two Owls, which came down the chimney. His Father greatly re∣joiced at all these signs, which betokened the va∣riety of his Eloquence, and the extent of his Learn∣ing; but he was more particularly pleased with the last, as it nearly resembled what happen'd at the birth of Homer <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vid.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Speech of Cornelius over his Son, at the Hour of his Birth.</HEAD>
<P>NO sooner was the cry of the Infant heard, but the old gentleman rushed into the room, and snatching it in his arms, examined every limb with attention. He was infinitely pleased to find,
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
that the Child had the Wart of Cicero, the wry neck of Alexander, knots upon his legs like Ma∣rius, and one of them shorter than the other like Agesilaus. The good Cornelius also hoped he would come to stammer like Demosthenes, in or∣der to be as eloquent; and in time arrive at many other defects of famous men. He held the child so long, that the Midwife, grown out of all pati∣ence, snatched it from his arms, in order to swad∣dle it. <Q>“Swaddle him! (quoth he) far be it from me to submit to such a pernicious Custom! Is not my son a Man? and is not Man the Lord of the Universe? Is it thus you use this Monarch at his first arrival in his dominions, to manacle and shackle him hand and foot? Is this what you call to be free-born? If you have no regard to his natural Liberty, at least have some to his natural Faculties. Behold with what agility he spreadeth his Toes, and moveth them with as great variety as his Fingers! a power, which in the small circle of a year may be totally abolish∣ed, by the enormous confinement of shoes and stockings. His Ears (which other animals turn with great advantage towards the sonorous ob∣ject) may, by the ministry of some accursed Nurse, for ever lye flat and immoveable. Not so the Ancients, they could move them at plea∣sure, and accordingly are often describ'd <HI>arrectis auribus.</HI> What a devil (quoth the Midwife) would you have your son move his Ears like a
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
Drill? Yes, fool (said he) why should he not have the perfection of a Drill, or of any other animal?”</Q> Mrs. Scriblerus, who lay all this while fretting at her husband's discourse, at last broke out to this purpose. <Q>“My dear, I have had many disputes with you upon this subject before I was a month gone: We have but one child, and cannot afford to throw him away up∣on experiments. I'll have my boy bred up like other gentlemen, at home, and always under my own eye.”</Q> All the Gossips with one voice, cried, Ay, ay; but Cornelius broke out in this man∣ner. <Q>“What, bred at home! Have I taken all this pains for a creature that is to lead the inglo∣rious life of a Cabbage, to suck the nutritious juices from the spot where he was first planted? No; to perambulate this terraqueous Globe is too small a Range; were it permitted, he should at least make the Tour of the whole System of the Sun. Let other Mortals pore upon Maps, and swallow the legends of lying travellers; the son of Cornelius shall make his own Legs his Compasses; with those he shall measure Con∣tinents, Islands, Capes, Bays, Streights, and Isthmus's: He shall himself take the altitude of the highest mountains, from the peak of Derby to the peak of Tenariff; when he has visited the top of Taurus, Imaus, Caucasus, and the famous Ararat, where Noah's Ark first moor'd, he may take a slight view of the snowy Riphaeans; nor
<PB N="122" REF="128" MS="y"/>
would I have him neglect Athos and Olympus, renowned for poetical fictions. Those that vo∣mit fire will deserve a more particular atten∣tion: I will therefore have him observe with great care Vesuvius, Aetna, the burning moun∣tain of Java, but chiefly Hecla the greatest ra∣rity in the Northern Regions. Then he may likewise contemplate the wonders of the Mephi∣tick cave. When he has div'd into the bowels of the earth, and survey'd the works of Nature under ground, and instructed herself fully in the nature of Vulcanos, Earthquakes, Thunders, Tempests, and Hurricanes, I hope he will bless the world with a more exact survey of the de∣serts of Arabia and Tartary, than as yet we are able to obtain: Then will I have him cross the seven Gulphs, measure the currents in the fif∣teen famous Streights, and search for those foun∣tains of fresh water that are at the bottom of the Ocean.”</Q>—At these last words Mrs. Scriblerus fell into a trembling: the description of this terrible Scene made too violent an impression upon a wo∣man in her condition, and threw her into a strong hysteric Fit; which might have proved dangerous, if Cornelius had not been push'd out of the room by the united force of the women.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing what befel the Doctor's Son and his Shield, on the Day of the Christ'∣ning.</HEAD>
<P>THE day of the Christ'ning being come, and the house filled with Gossips, the Levity of whose Conversation suited but ill with the Gra∣vity of Dr. Cornelius, he cast about how to pass this day more agreeably to his Character; that is to say, not without some <HI>Profitable Conference,</HI> nor wholly without observance of some <HI>Ancient Cu∣stom.</HI></P>
<P>He remembered to have read in Theocritus, that the Cradle of Hercules was a Shield; and being possess'd of an antique <HI>Buckler</HI> which he held as a most inestimable Relick, he determined to have the infant laid therein, and in that manner brought into the Study, to be shown to certain learned men of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>The regard he had for this Shield, had caused him formerly to compile a Dissertation concern∣ing it <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See the Dissertation on Dr. Woodward's Shield▪</NOTE>, proving from the several properties, and particularly the colour of the Rust, the exact chronology thereof.</P>
<P>With this Treatise, and a moderate supper, he proposed to entertain his Guests; tho' he had also
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
another design, to have their assistance in the cal∣culation of his Son's <HI>Nativity.</HI></P>
<P>He therefore took the Buckler out of a Case (in which he always kept it, lest it might contract any modern rust) and entrusted it to his House∣maid, with orders, that when the company was come she should lay the Child carefully in it, co∣ver'd with a mantle of blue Sattin.</P>
<P>The Guests were no sooner seated, but they entered into a warm Debate about the <HI>Triclinium</HI> and the manner of <HI>Decubitus</HI> of the Ancients, which Cornelius broke off in this manner:</P>
<Q>“This day, my Friends, I purpose to exhibit my son before you; a Child not wholly unwor∣thy of Inspection, as he is descended from a Race of Virtuosi. Let the Physiognomists exa∣mine his features; let the Chirographists behold his Palm; but above all let us consult for the calculation of his Nativity. To this end, as the child is not vulgar, I will not present him unto you in a vulgar manner. He shall be cradled in my Ancient Shield, so famous through the Univer∣sities of Europe. You all know how I pur∣chased that invaluable piece of Antiquity at the great (though indeed inadequate) expence of all the Plate of our family, how happily I carried it off, and how triumphantly I transported it hi∣ther, to the inexpressible grief of all Germany. Happy in every circumstance, but that it broke the heart of the great Melchior Insipidus!”</Q>
<P><PB N="125" REF="131"/>
Here he stopp'd his Speech, upon sight of the Maid, who enter'd the room with the Child: He took it in his arms and proceeded:</P>
<P><Q>“”Behold then my Child, but first behold the Shield: Behold this Rust,—or rather let me call it this precious Aerugo,—behold this beautiful Varnish of Time,—this venerable Verdure of so many Ages—</Q></P>
<P>In speaking these words, he slowly lifted up the Mantle, which covered it, inch by inch; but at every inch he uncovered, his cheeks grew paler, his hand trembled, his nerves failed, till on sight of the whole, the Tremor became universal: The Shield and the Infant both dropt to the ground, and he had only strength enough to cry out, <Q>“O God! my Shield, my Shield!”</Q></P>
<P>The Truth was, the Maid (extremely con∣cern'd for the reputation of her own cleanliness, and her young master's honour) had scoured it as clean as her Andirons <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Poor Vadius, long with learned spleen devour'd,</L>
<L>Can taste no pleasure since his Shield was scour'd.</L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Cornelius sunk back on a chair, the Guests stood astonished, the infant squaul'd, the maid ran in, snatch'd it up again in her arms, flew into her mistress's room, and told what had happen'd. Down stairs in an instant hurried all the Gossips, where they found the Doctor in a Trance: Hun∣gary water, Hartshorn, and the confused noise of shrill voices, at length awaken'd him: when open∣ing
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
his eyes, he saw the Shield in the hands of the House-maid. <Q>“O Woman! Woman! he cry'd (and snatch'd it violently from her) was it to thy ignorance that this Relick owes its ruin? where, where is the beautiful Crust that cover∣ed thee so long? where those Traces of Time, and <HI>Fingers</HI> as it were of Antiquity? Where all those beautiful obscurities, the cause of much delightful disputation, where doubt and curio∣sity went hand in hand, and eternally exercised the speculations of the learned? All this the rude Touch of an ignorant woman hath done away! The <HI>curious Prominence</HI> at the belly of that figure, which some taking for the <HI>Cuspis</HI> of a sword, denominated a Roman Soldier; others account∣ing the <HI>Insignia Virilia,</HI> pronounced to be one of the <HI>Dii Termini;</HI> behold she hath cleaned it in like shameful sort, and shewn to be the head of a Nail. O my Shield! my Shield! well may I say with Horace, <HI>non bene relicta Par∣mula.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>The Gossips, not at all inquiring into the cause of his sorrow, only asked if the Child had no hurt? and cry'd, <Q>“Come, come, all is well; what has the woman done but her duty? a tight cleanly wench I warrant her; what a stir a man makes about a <HI>Bason,</HI> that an hour ago, before this la∣bour was bestowed upon it, a Country Barber would not have hung at his shop door. A <HI>Ba∣son!</HI> (cry'd another) no such matter, 'tis no∣thing
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
but a paultry old <HI>Sconce,</HI> with the nozzle broke off.”</Q> The learned Gentlemen, who till now had stood speechless, hereupon looking nar∣rowly on the Shield, declared their Assent to this latter opinion; and desired Cornelius to be com∣forted, assuring him, it was a <HI>Sconce</HI> and no other. But this, instead of comforting, threw the Doctor into such a violent Fit of passion, that he was car∣ried off groaning and speechless to bed; where, being quite spent, he fell into a kind of slumber.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Suction and Nutrition of the Great Scriblerus in his Infancy, and of the first Rudiments of his Learning.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as Cornelius awaked, he raised him∣self on his elbow, and casting his eye on Mrs. Scriblerus, spoke as follows. <Q>“Wisely was it said by Homer, that in the Cellar of Jupiter are two barrels, the one of good, the other of evil, which he never bestows on mortals sepa∣rately, but constantly mingles them together. Thus at the same time hath Heav'n blessed me with the birth of a Son, and afflicted me with the scouring of my Shield. Yet let us not re∣pine
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
at his Dispensations, who gives, and who takes away; but rather join in prayer, that the Rust of Antiquity which he hath been pleased to take from my Shield, may be added to my Son; and that so much of it, as it is my pur∣pose he shall contract in his Education, may never be destroy'd by any Modern Polishing.”</Q></P>
<P>He could no longer bear the sight of the Shield, but ordered it should be removed for ever from his eyes. It was not long after purchas'd by Dr. Woodward, who, by the assistance of Mr. Kemp▪ incrusted it with a new Rust, and is the same whereof a Cut hath been engraved, and exhibited to the great Contentation of the learned.</P>
<P>Cornelius now began to regulate the Suction of his child. Seldom did there pass a day withou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disputes between him and the Mother, or the Nurse, concerning the nature of Aliment. The poor woman never dined but he denied her some dish or other, which he judged prejudicial to her milk. One day she had a longing desire to a piece of beef, and as she stretch'd her hand towards it, the old gentleman drew it away, and spoke to this effect. <Q>“Had'st thou read the Ancients, O Nurse, thou would'st prefer the welfare of the Infant which thou nourishest, to the indulging of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> irregular and voracious Appetite. Beef, it is true, may confer a Robustness on the limbs of my son, but will hebetate and clogg his Intel∣lectuals.”</Q> While he spoke this, the Nurse
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
looked upon him with much anger, and now and then cast a wishful eye upon the Beef—<Q>“Passion (continued the Doctor, still holding the dish) throws the mind into too violent a fermentation; it is a kind of Fever of the soul, or, as Horace expresses it▪ a <HI>Short Madness.</HI> Consider, Wo∣man, that this day's Suction of my son may cause him to imbibe many ungovernable Passions, and in a manner spoil him for the temper of a Phi∣losopher. Romulus by sucking a Wolf, be∣came of a fierce and savage disposition; and were I to breed some Ottoman Emperor, or Founder of a Military Commonwealth, perhaps I might indulge thee in this carnivorous Appetite.”</Q>—What, interrupted the Nurse, Beef spoil the un∣derstanding? that's fine indeed—how then could our Parson preach as he does upon Beef, and Pud∣ding too, if you go to that? Don't tell me of your Ancients, had not you almost killed the poor babe with a dish of Daemonial black Broth?—<Q>“Lace∣daemonian black Broth, thou would'st say, (re∣plied Cornelius) but I cannot allow the surfeit to have been occasioned by that diet, since it was recommended by the Divine Lycurgus. No▪ Nurse, thou must certainly have eaten some meats of ill digestion the day before, and that was the real cause of his disorder. Consider, Woman, the different Temperaments of diffe∣rent Nations: What makes the English Phleg∣matick and melancholy, but Beef? what renders
<PB N="130" REF="136"/>
the Welsh so hot and cholerick, but Cheese and Leeks? the French derive their levity from their Soups, Frogs, and Mushrooms: I would not let my Son dine like an Italian, left like an Ita∣lian he should be jealous and revengeful: The warm and solid diet of Spain may be more be∣neficial, as it might indue him with a profund Gravity, but at the same time he might suck in with their food their intolerable Vice of Pride. Therefore, Nurse, in short, I hold it requisite to deny you at present, not only Beef, but like∣wise whatsoever any of those Nations eat.”</Q> Du∣ring this speech, the Nurse remain'd pouting and marking her plate with the knife, nor would she touch a bit during the whole dinner. This the old Gentleman observing, ordered that the Child, to avoid the risque of imbibing ill humours, should be kept from her breast all that day, and be fed with Butter, mix'd with Honey, according to a Prescription he had met with somewhere in Eu∣stathius upon Homer. This indeed gave the Child a great looseness, but he was not concerned at it, in the opinion that whatever harm it might do his body, would be amply recompenced by the im∣provements of his understanding. But from thence∣forth he insisted every day upon a particular Diet to be observed by the Nurse; under which having been long uneasy, she at last parted from the fa∣mily, on his ordering her for dinner the <HI>Paps</HI> of
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
a <HI>Sow</HI> with Pig; taking it as the highest indignity, and a direct Insult upon her Sex and Calling.</P>
<P>Four years of young Martin's life passed away in squabbles of this nature. Mrs. Scriblerus con∣sidered it was now time to instruct him in the sun∣damentals of Religion, and to that end took no small pains in teaching him his <HI>Catechism.</HI> But Cornelius looked upon this as a tedious way of In∣struction, and therefore employed his head to find out more pleasing methods, the better to induce him to be fond of learning. He would frequent∣ly carry him to the <HI>Puppet-show,</HI> of the Creation of the world, where the Child with exceeding de∣light gained a notion of the History of the Bible. His first rudiments in prophane history were ac∣quired by seeing of <HI>Raree-shows,</HI> where he was brought acquainted with all the Princes of Europe. In short, the old Gentleman so contrived it, to make every thing contribute to the improvement of his knowledge, even to his very Dress. He in∣vented for him a Geographical suit of cloaths, which might give him some hints of that Science, and likewise some knowledge of the Commerce of different Nations. He had a French Hat with an African Feather, Holland Shirts and Flanders Lace, English Cloth lined with Indian Silk, his Gloves were Italian, and his Shoes were Spanish: He was made to observe this, and daily catechis'd thereupon, which his Father was wont to call "Travelling at home." He never gave him a Fig
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
or an Orange but he obliged him to give an ac∣count from what Country it came. In Natural history he was much assisted by his Curiosity in <HI>Sign-Posts,</HI> insomuch that he hath often confessed he owed to them the knowledge of many Crea∣tures which he never found since in any Author, such as White Lions, Golden Dragons, &amp;c. He once thought the same of Green Men, but had since found them mentioned by Kercherus, and verified in the History of William of Newbury <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Gul. Neubrig. Book i. ch. 27. P.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His disposition to the Mathematicks was disco∣vered very early, by his drawing <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Pascal's Life—Locke of Educ. etc. P.—There are some extravagant lies told of the excellent Pascal's amazing genius for Mathematics in his early youth; and some trifling directions given for the introduction to the elements of Science, in Mr. Locke's book of Education.</NOTE>parallel lines on his bread and butter, and intersecting them at equal Angles, so as to form the whole Superficies into Squares. But in the midst of all these Improve∣ments, a stop was put to his learning the <HI>Alphabet,</HI> nor would he let him proceed to Letter D, till he could truly and distinctly pronounce C in the an∣cient manner, at which the Child unhappily bog∣gled for near three months. He was also obliged to delay his learning to <HI>write,</HI> having turn'd away the Writing Master because he knew nothing of Fabius's Waxen Tables.</P>
<P>Cornelius having read, and seriously weighed the methods by which the famous Montaigne was

educated <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Who was taught Latin in his nurses arms, and not suffered to hear a word of his mother tongue, till he could speak the other perfectly.</NOTE>, and resolving in some degree to exceed them, resolved he should speak and learn nothing but the learned Languages, and especially the Greek; in which he constantly eat and drank, according to Homer. But what most conduced to his easy attainment of this Language, was his love of Gin∣ger-bread; which his Father observing, caused it to be stampt with the Letters of the Greek Al∣phabet; and the child the very first day eat as far as Iota. By his particular application to this lan∣guage above the rest, he attained so great a profi∣cience therein, that Gronovius ingenuously con∣fesses he durst not confer with this child in Greek at eight years old <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">So Montaigne says of his Latin.—George Bucanan et Mark Antoine Muret, mes precepteurs domestiques, m'ont dit souvent que j'avois ce langage en mon enfance si prest et si à main qu'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls craignoient à m'accoster.—Somme, nous nous lati∣nizames tant, qu'il en regorgea jusque à nos villages tout au∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, ou il y a encores, et ont pris pied par l'usage, plusieurs ap∣pellations Latines d' Artisans et d' outils.</NOTE>, and at fourteen he composed a Tragedy in the same language, as the younger <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Plin.

<P><Q>“”I heartily wish a diligent search may be made after the true <HI>Crepitaculum,</HI> or <HI>Rattle</HI> of the An∣cients, for that (as <HI>Archytas Tarentinus</HI> was of opinion) kept the children from breaking Earth∣ern Ware.

Neither <HI>Cross</HI> and <HI>Pile,</HI> nor <HI>Ducks</HI> and <HI>Drakes</HI> are quite so ancient as <HI>Handy-dandy,</HI> tho' Macrobius and St. Augustine take notice of the first, and Minutius Foelix, de∣scribes the latter; but <HI>Handy-dandy</HI> is mention'd by Aristotle, Plato, and Aristophanes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”The Play which the Italians call <HI>Cinque,</HI> and the French <HI>Mourre,</HI> is extremely ancient; it was played at by <HI>Hymen</HI> and <HI>Cupid</HI> at the Mar∣riage

<P><Q>“”But the <HI>Chytrindra</HI> described by the same Au∣thor is certainly not our <HI>Hot-cockle;</HI> for that was by pinching and not by striking; tho' there are good authors who affirm the <HI>Rathapygismus</HI> to be yet nearer the modern <HI>Hot-cockles.</HI> My son Martin may use either of them indifferently, they being equally antique.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“”In a word, let my son Martin disport himself at any Game truly Antique, except one, which was invented by a people among the Thracians, who hung up one of their Companions in a Rope, and gave him a Knife to cut himself down; which if he failed in, he was suffered to hang till he was dead; and this was only rec∣koned a sort of joke.

<P><Q>“”I cannot conclude, without taking notice of the beauty of the <HI>Greek</HI> names, whose Etymolo∣gies acquaint us with the nature of the sports; and how infinitely, both in sense and sound, they excel our barbarous names of Plays.</Q></P>
<P>Notwithstanding the foregoing Injunctions of Dr. Cornelius, he yet condescended to allow the Child the use of some few modern Play-things; such as might prove of any benefit to his mind, by instilling an early notion of the sciences. For ex∣ample, he found that <HI>Marbles</HI> taught him <HI>Percus∣sion</HI> and the <HI>Laws of Motion; Nut-crackers</HI> the use of the <HI>Leaver; Swinging</HI> on the ends of a Board, the <HI>Balance; Bottle-screws,</HI> the <HI>Vice; Whir∣ligigs</HI> the <HI>Axis</HI> and <HI>Peritrochia; Bird-cages,</HI> the <HI>Pully;</HI> and <HI>Tops</HI> the <HI>Centrifrugal</HI> motion.</P>

Others of his sports were farther carried to im∣prove his tender soul even in Virtue and Morality.

<P>Besides all these, he taught him as a diversion, an odd and secret manner of <HI>Stealing,</HI> according to the Custom of the Lacedaemonians; wherein he succeeded so well, that he practised it to the day of his death.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Gymnasticks, in what Exercises Martinus was educated; something concerning Musick, and what sort of a Man his Uncle was.</HEAD>
<P>NOR was Cornelius less careful in adhering to the rules of the purest Antiquity, in re∣lation to the <HI>Exercises</HI> of his Son. He was stript, powder'd, and anointed, but not constantly bath'd, which occasioned many heavy complaints of the Laundress about dirtying his linen. When he played at Quoits, he was allowed his Breeches and Stockings; because the <HI>Discoboli</HI> (as Cornelius
<PB N="139" REF="145"/>
well knew) were naked to the middle only. The Mother often contended for modern Sports, and common Customs, but this was his constant re∣ply, <Q>“Let a Daughter be the care of her Mother, but the Education of a Son should be the delight of his Father.”</Q></P>
<P>It was about this time, he heard, to his exceed∣ing content, that the <HI>Harpastus</HI> of the Ancients was yet in use in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and known there by the name of <HI>Hurling.</HI> He was sensible the com∣mon <HI>Foot-ball</HI> was a very imperfect imitation of that exercise; and thought it necessary to send Martin into the West, to be initiated in that truly ancient and manly part of the <HI>Gymnasticks.</HI> The poor boy was so unfortunate as to return with a broken leg. This Cornelius looked upon but as a slight ailment, and promised his Mother he would instantly cure it: He slit a green Reed, and cast the Knife upward, then tying the two parts of the Reed to the disjointed place, pronounced these words <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.

<P>Mrs. Scriblerus, to prevent him from exposing her Son to the like dangerous Exercises for the fu∣ture,
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
proposed to send for a Dancing-Master, and to have him taught the Minuet and Rigadoon. <Q>“Dancing (quoth Cornelius) I much approve, for <HI>Socrates</HI> said the best Dancers were the best Warriors; but not those species of Dancing which you mention: They are certainly Cor∣ruptions of the Comic and Satyric Dance, which were utterly disliked by the sounder Ancients.

<P>The poor Lady was at last enur'd to bear all these things with a laudable patience, till one day her husband was seized with a new thought. He had met with a saying, that <Q><HI>“Spleen, Garter,</HI> and <HI>Girdle</HI> are the three impediments to the <HI>Cursus.”</HI></Q> Therefore Pliny (lib. xi. cap. 37.) says, that such as excel in that exercise have their <HI>Spleen</HI> caute∣rized, <Q>“My son (quoth Cornelius) runs but hea∣vily;
<PB N="141" REF="147"/>
therefore I will have this operation per∣formed upon him immediately. Moreover it will cure that immoderate Laughter to which I perceive he is addicted: For Laughter (as the same author hath it, ibid.) is caused by the big∣ness of the Spleen.”</Q> This design was no sooner hinted to Mrs. Scriblerus, but she burst into tears, wrung her hands, and instantly sent to his Brother Albertus, begging him for the love of God to make haste to her Husband.</P>
<P>Albertus was a discreet man, sober in his opi∣nions, clear of Pedantry, and knowing enough both in Books and in the World, to preserve a due regard for whatever was useful or excellent, whe∣ther ancient or modern: If he had not always the authority, he had at least the art, to divert Cor∣nelius from many extravagancies. It was well he came speedily, or Martin could not have boasted the entire Quota of his Viscera. <Q>“”What does it signify (quoth Albertus) whether my Nephew excels in the <HI>Cursus</HI> or not? Speed is often a symptom of Cowardice, witness Hares and Deer.—Do not forget Achilles (quoth Cor∣nelius) I know that Running has been condemn∣ed by the proud Spartans, as useless in war; and yet Demosthenes could say, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; a thought which the English Hudi∣bras has well rendered,</Q>

“That's true (quoth Albertus) but pray consider on the other side that Animals <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Blackmore's Essay on Spleen. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>spleen'd grow extremely salacious, an experiment well known in dogs. Cornelius was struck with this, and replied gravely; If it be so, I will defer the Operation, for I will not encrease the powers of my son's body at the expence of those of his mind. I am indeed disappointed in most of my projects, and fear I must sit down at last con∣tented with such methods of Education as mo∣dern barbarity affords. Happy had it been for us all, had we lived in the age of Augustus! Then my son might have heard the Philosophers dispute in the Porticos of the Palaestra, and at the same time form'd his Body and his Under∣standing.

You say well (quoth Albertus) and we have several other kinds of Vectitation unknown to the Ancients; particularly flying Chariots, where the people may have the benefit of this exercise at the small expence of a farthing.

Whence proceeds the degene∣racy of our Morals? Is it not from the loss of ancient Musick, by which (says Aristotle) they taught all the Virtues?

It is well known that when the Lace∣daemonian Mob were up, they <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Suidas in Timotheo. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>commonly sent for a Lesbian Musician to appease them, and they immediately grew calm as soon as they heard Terpander sing: Yet I don't believe that the Pope's whole band of Musick, though the best of this age, could keep his Holiness's Image from being burnt on a fifth of November.

I can play some fragments of Lesbian tunes, and I wish I were to try them upon the most passionate crea∣tures alive.—You never had a better oppor∣tunity (says Albertus) for yonder are two Ap∣ple-women scolding, and just ready to uncoif one another.”</Q> With that Cornelius, undress'd as he was, jumps out into his Balcony, his Lyra in hand, in his slippers, with his breeches hang∣ing down to his ankles, a stocking upon his head, and a wastcoat of murrey-coloured sattin upon his
<PB N="146" REF="152"/>
body: He touch'd his Lyra with a very unusual sort of an Harpegiatura, nor were his hopes frus∣trated. The odd Equipage, the uncouth Instru∣ment, the strangeness of the Man and of the Mu∣sick, drew the ears and eyes of the whole Mob that were got about the two female Champions, and at last of the Combatants themselves. They all approach'd the Balcony, in as close attention as Orpheus's first Audience of Cattle, or that of an Italian Opera, when some favourite Air is just awakened. This sudden effect of his Musick en∣couraged him mightily, and it was observed he never touched his Lyre in such a truly chromatick and enharmonick manner as upon that occasion. The mob laugh'd, sung, jump'd, danc'd, and used many odd gestures, all which he judged to be caused by the various strains and modulations. <Q>“Mark (quoth he) in this, the power of the Ionian, in that, you see the effect of the Aeolian.”</Q> But in a little time they began to grow riotous, and threw stones: Cornelius then withdrew, but with the greatest air of Triumph in the world. <Q>“Brother (said he) do you observe I have mixed unawares too much of the <HI>Phrygian;</HI> I might change it to the <HI>Lydian,</HI> and soften their riotous tempers: But it is enough: learn from this Sample to speak with veneration of ancient Musick.

<P>COrnelius having (as hath been said) many ways been disappointed in his attempts of improving the bodily Forces of his son, thought it now high time to apply to the Culture of his Internal faculties.

The wise Cornelius was convinced, that these being <HI>Polemical</HI> Arts, could no more be learned alone, than Fencing or Cudgel-playing. He thought it therefore necessary to look out for some Youth of pregnant parts, to be a sort of humble Companion to his son in those studies. His good fortune directed him to one of the most singular en∣dowments, whose name was Conradus Crambe, who by the father's side was related to the <HI>Crouches</HI> of Cambridge, and his mother was Cousin to Mr. <HI>Swan,</HI> Gamester and Punster of the City of Lon∣don. So that from both parents he drew a natu∣ral disposition to sport himself with <HI>Words,</HI> which as they are said to be the counters of wise Men, and ready-money of Fools, Crambe had great store of cash of the latter sort. Happy Martin in such a Parent, and such a Companion! What might not he atchieve in Arts and Sciences.</P>
<P>Here I must premise a general observation of great benefit to mankind. That there are many people who have the use only of one Operation of the Intellect, tho', like short-sighted men, they can hardly discover it themselves: They can form <HI>sin∣gle apprehensions</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">When a learned Friend once urged to our Author the Au∣thority of a famous Dictionary-maker against the latinity of the expression <HI>amor publicus,</HI> which he had used in an inscription, he replied, that he would allow a Dictionary-maker to understand a single word, but not two words put together.</NOTE>, but have neither of the other two faculties, the <HI>judicium</HI> or <HI>discursus.</HI> Now as it is wisely ordered, that people deprived of one
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
sense have the others in more perfection, such peo∣ple will form single Ideas with a great deal of vi∣vacity; and happy were it indeed if they would confine themselves to such, without forming <HI>judi∣cia,</HI> much less <HI>argumentations.</HI></P>
<P>Cornelius quickly discovered, that these two last operations of the intellect were very weak in Mar∣tin, and almost totally extinguished in Crambe; however he used to say, that Rules of Logick are Spectacles to a purblind understanding, and there∣fore he resolved to proceed with his two Pupils.</P>
<P>Martin's understanding was so totally immers'd in <HI>sensible objects,</HI> that he demanded examples from Material things of the abstracted Ideas of Logick: As for Crambe, he contented himself with the Words, and when he could but form some con∣ceit upon them, was fully satisfied. Thus Crambe would tell his Instructor, that All men were not <HI>singular;</HI> that Individuality could hardly be prae∣dicated of any man, for it was commonly said that a man <HI>is</HI> not the same he <HI>was,</HI> that madmen are <HI>beside themselves,</HI> and drunken men <HI>come to them∣selves;</HI> which shows, that few men have that most valuable logical endowment, Individuality <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><Q>“But if it be possible for the same man to have distinct in∣communicable consciousness at different times, it is without doubt the same man would at different times make different persons.

told Martin that a shoulder of mutton was an individual, which Crambe denied, for he had seen it cut into commons: That's true (quoth the Tutor) but you never saw it cut into shoulders of mutton: If it could (quoth Crambe) it would be the most lovely individual of the University. When he was told, a <HI>substance</HI> was that which was <HI>subject to accidents;</HI> then Soldiers (quoth Crambe) are the most substantial people in the world. Neither would he allow it to be a good definition of <HI>acci∣dent,</HI> that it could be <HI>present</HI> or <HI>absent without the destruction of the subject;</HI> since there are a great many accidents that destroy the subject, as burn∣ing does a house, and death a man. But as to that, Cornelius informed him, that there was a <HI>natural death,</HI> and a <HI>logical death;</HI> that though a man after his natural death was not capable of the least parish-office, yet he might still keep his Stall amongst the logical praedicaments.</P>
<P>Cornelius was forced to give Martin sensible images; thus calling up the Coachman he asked him what he had seen at the Bear-garden? the man answered, he saw two men fight a prize; one was a fair man, a Sergeant in the Guards; the other black, a Butcher; the Sergeant had red Breeches, the Butcher blue; they fought upon a Stage about four o'clock, and the Sergeant wound∣ed
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
the Butcher in the leg. <Q>“Mark (quoth Cor∣nelius) how the fellow runs through the praedi∣caments.

He was forced to let them into this secret, for Martin could not con∣ceive how a habit of dancing inher'd in a dancing∣master, when he did not dance; nay, he would demand the Characteristicks of Relations: Crambe used to help him out by telling him, a Cuckold, a losing gamester, a man that had not din'd, a young heir that was kept short by his father, might be all known by their countenance; that, in this last case, the Paternity and Filiation leave very sensible impressions in the <HI>relatum</HI> and <HI>correlatum.</HI> The greatest difficulty was when they came to the Tenth praedicament: Crambe affirmed, that his habitus was more a substance than he was; for his cloaths could better subsist without him, than he without his cloaths.</P>

Martin supposed an <HI>Universal Man</HI> to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Burgess of a Corporation, that represented a great many Individuals.

On the other hand Crambe, to show himself of a more penetrating genius, swore that he could frame a conception of a Lord Mayor not only without his Horse, Gown, and Gold Chain, but even without Stature, Feature, Colour, Hands, Head, Feet, or any Body; which he supposed was the abstract of a Lord Mayor <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This is not a fair representation of what is said in the <HI>Es∣say on Human Underst.</HI> concerning <HI>general and abstract ideas.</HI> But serious writers have done that Philosopher the same injustice.</NOTE>Cornelius told him that he was a lying Raseal; that an <HI>Universale</HI> was not the object of imagination, and that there was no such thing in reality, or a <HI>parte Rei.</HI> But I can prove (quoth Crambe) that there are <HI>Clysters a parte Rei,</HI> but <HI>Clysters</HI> are <HI>universales; ergo.</HI> Thus I prove my Minor. <HI>Quod aptum est inesse multis,</HI> is an <HI>universale</HI> by definition: but every clyster before it is administred has that quality; therefore every clyster is an <HI>universale.</HI></P>

He also found fault with the Advertisements, that they were not strict logical <HI>definitions:</HI> In an advertisement of a Dog stolen or strayed, he said it ought to begin thus, <HI>An irrational animal</HI> of the <HI>Genus caninum,</HI> &amp;c. Cornelius told them, that tho' those advertisements were not framed according to the exact rules of logical definitions, being only <HI>descriptions</HI> of things <HI>numero differentibus,</HI> yet they contained a faint image of the <HI>praedicabilia,</HI> and were highly subservient to the common purposes of life; often discovering things that were lost, both animate and inanimate. <HI>An Italian Grey∣hound, of a mouse-colour, a white speck in the neck, lame of one leg, belongs to such a Lady.</HI> Greyhound, <HI>genus;</HI> mouse-colour'd, etc. <HI>differentia;</HI> lame of one leg, <HI>accidens;</HI> belongs to such a Lady, <HI>pro∣prium.</HI></P>
<P>Though I'm afraid I have transgressed upon my Reader's patience already, I cannot help taking notice of one thing more extraordinary than any yet mentioned; which was Crambe's <HI>Treatise of Syllogisms.</HI> He supposed that a Philosopher's brain was like a great Forest, where Ideas ranged like animals of several kinds; that those Ideas copu∣lated, and engendered Conclusions; that when those of different Species copulate, they bring forth monsters or absurdities; that the <HI>Major</HI> is the male, the <HI>Minor</HI> the female, which copulate by the Mid∣dle Term, and engender the Conclusion. Hence they are called the <HI>praemissa,</HI> or Predecessors of the
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
Conclusion; and it is properly said by the Logici∣ans <HI>quod pariant scientiam, opinionem,</HI> they <HI>beget</HI> science, opinion, etc. Universal Propositions are Persons of quality; and therefore in Logick they are said to be of the first <HI>Figure.</HI> Singular Propo∣sitions are private persons, and therefore placed in the third or last figure, or rank. From those principles all the rules of Syllogisms naturally follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. That there are only three Terms, neither more nor less; for to a child there can be only one father and one mother.</P>
<P N="2">II. From universal premisses there follows an uni∣versal conclusion, as if one should say, that persons of quality always beget persons of quality.</P>
<P N="3">III. From the singular premisses follows only a singular conclusion, that is, if the parents be only private people, the issue must be so like∣wise.</P>
<P N="4">IV. From particular propositions nothing can be concluded, because the <HI>Individua vaga</HI> are (like whoremasters and common strumpets) barren.</P>
<P N="5">V. There cannot be more in the conclusion than was in the premisses, that is, children can only inherit from their parents.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The conclusion follows the weaker part, that is, children inherit the diseases of their parents.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="155" REF="161"/>
VII. From two negatives nothing can be conclud∣ed, for from divorce or separation there can come no issue.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The medium cannot enter the conclusion, that being logical incest.</P>
<P N="9">IX. An hypothetical proposition is only a con∣tract, or a promise of marriage; from such therefore there can spring no real issue.</P>
<P N="10">X. When the premisses or parents are necessa∣rily join'd (or in lawful wedlock) they beget lawful issue; but contingently joined, they beget bastards.</P>
<P>So much for the Affirmative propositions; the Negative must be deferred to another occasion.</P>
<P>Crambe used to value himself upon this System, from whence he said one might see the propriety of the expression, <HI>such a one has a barren imagina∣tion;</HI> and how common it is for such people to <HI>adopt</HI> conclusions that are not the issue of their premisses? therefore as an Absurdity is a <HI>Monster,</HI> a Falsity is a <HI>Bastard;</HI> and a true conclusion that followeth not from the premisses, may properly be said to be <HI>adopted.</HI> But then what is an En∣thymem? (quoth Cornelius.) Why, an Enthy∣mem (replied Crambe) is when the Major is in∣deed married to the Minor, but the Marriage <HI>kept secret.</HI></P>
<P>METAPHYSICKS were a large field in which to exercise the Weapons <HI>Logick</HI> had put into their
<PB N="156" REF="162"/>
hands. Here Martin and Crambe used to engage like any prize-fighters, before their Father, and his other Learned companions of the Symposiacks. And as Prize-fighters will agree to lay aside a buck∣ler, or some such defensive weapon, so would Crambe promise not to use <HI>simpliciter et secundum quid,</HI> provided Martin would part with <HI>materiali∣ter et formaliter:</HI> But it was found, that without the help of the defensive armour of those Distinc∣tions, the arguments cut so deep, that they fetch∣ed blood at every stroke. Their <HI>Theses</HI> were picked out of Suarez, Thomas Aquinas, and other learned writers on those subjects. I shall give the Reader a taste of some of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. If the Innate Desire of the knowledge of Me∣taphysicks was the cause of the Fall of Adam; and the <HI>Arbor Porphyriana,</HI> the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil? <HI>affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. If transcendental goodness could be truly pre∣dicated of the Devil? <HI>affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Whether one, or many be first? or if one doth not suppose the notion of many? <HI>Suarez.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. If the desire of news in mankind be <HI>appetitus innatus,</HI> not <HI>elicitus? affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Whether there is in human understandings po∣tential falsities? <HI>affirm'd.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. Whether God loves a <HI>possible Angel</HI> better than an <HI>actually-existent flye? deny'd.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="157" REF="163"/>
VII. If Angels pass from one extreme to another without going through the middle? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. If Angels know things more clearly in a morning? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Whether every Angel hears what one An∣gel says to another? <HI>deny'd. Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. If temptation be <HI>proprium quarto modo</HI> of the Devil? <HI>deny'd. Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. Whether one Devil can illuminate another? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="12">XII. If there would have been any females born in the state of Innocence? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. If the Creation was finished in six days, be∣cause six is the most perfect number; or if six be the most perfect number, because the Creation was finished in six days? <HI>Aquinas.</HI></P>
<P>There were several others, of which in the course of the life of this learned Person we may have occasion to treat; and one parti∣cularly that remains undecided to this day; it was taken from the learned Suarez.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. <HI>An praeter</HI> esse reale <HI>actualis essentiae sit aliud</HI> esse necessarium <HI>quo res actualiter existat?</HI> In English thus. Whether besides the real be∣ing of actual being, there be any other being necessary to cause a thing to be?</P>
<P>This brings into my mind a Project to banish Metaphysicks out of Spain, which it was supposed might be effectuated by this method: That no∣body
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
should use any Compound or Decompound of the Substantial Verbs but as they are read in the common conjugations: for every body will allow, that if you debar a Metaphysician from <HI>ens, essen∣tia, entitas, subsistentia,</HI> &amp;c. there is an end of him.</P>
<P>Crambe regretted extremely, that <HI>Substantial Forms,</HI> a race of harmless beings which had last∣ed for many years, and afforded a comfortable sub∣sistence to many poor Philosophers, should be now hunted down like so many Wolves, without the possibility of a retreat. He considered that it had gone much harder with them than with <HI>Essences,</HI> which had retired from the <HI>Schools</HI> into the <HI>Apothe∣caries Shops,</HI> where some of them had been ad∣vanced into the degree of <HI>Quintessences.</HI> He thought there should be a retreat for poor <HI>substantial forms,</HI> amongst the Gentlemen-ushers at court; and that there were indeed <HI>substantial forms,</HI> such as <HI>forms of Prayer,</HI> and <HI>forms of Government,</HI> without which the things themselves could never long subsist. He also used to wonder that there was not a reward for such as could find out a <HI>fourth Figure</HI> in <HI>Lo∣gick,</HI> as well as for those who should discover the <HI>Longitude.</HI></P>

<P>COrnelius, it is certain, had a most supersti∣tious veneration for the Ancients; and if they contradicted each other, his Reason was so pliant and ductile, that he was always of the opi∣nion of the last he read. But he reckoned it a point of honour never to be vanquished in a dis∣pute; from which quality he acquired the Title of the <HI>Invincible Doctor.</HI> While the Professor of Anatomy was demonstrating to his son the several kinds of <HI>Intestines,</HI> Cornelius affirmed that there were only two, the <HI>Colon</HI> and the <HI>Aichos,</HI> accord∣ing to Hippocrates, who it was impossible could ever be mistaken. It was in vain to assure him this error proceeded from want of accuracy in dividing the whole Canal of the Guts: Say what you please (he replied) this is both mine and Hippocrates's opinion. You may with equal rea∣son (answer'd the Professor) affirm, that a man's Liver hath five Lobes, and deny the Circulation of the blood. Ocular demonstration (said Corne∣lius) seems to be on your side, yet I shall not give it up: Show me any viscus of a human body, and I will bring you a monster that differs from the common rule in the structure of it. If Nature
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
shews such variety in the same age, why may she not have extended it further in several ages? Pro∣duce me a man now of the age of an Antediluvian; of the strength of Samson, or the size of the Gi∣ants. If in the whole, why not in parts of the body, may it not be possible the present genera∣tion of men may differ from the Ancients? The Mo∣derns have perhaps lenghthened the channel of the guts by Gluttony, and diminished the liver by hard drinking. Though it shall be demonstrated that modern blood circulates, yet I will believe with Hippocrates, that the blood of the Ancients had a flux and reflux from the heart, like a Tide. Con∣sider how Luxury hath introduced new diseases, and with them not improbably altered the whole Course of the Fluids. Consider how the current of might Rivers, nay the very channels of the O∣cean are changed from what they were in ancient days; and can we be so vain to imagine that the Mi∣crocosm of the human body alone is exempted from the fate of all things? I question not but plausible Conjectures may be made even as to the Time when the blood first began to circulate.—Such disputes as these frequently perplex'd the Professor to that degree, that he would now and then in a passion leave him in the middle of a Lecture, as he did at this time.</P>
<P>There unfortunately happened soon after, an unusual accident, which retarded the prosecution of the studies of Martin. Having purchased the
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
body of a Malefactor, he hir'd a Room for its dis∣section near the Pest-fields in St. Giles's, at a lit∣tle distance from Tyburn Road. Crambe (to whose care this body was committed) carried it thither about twelve a clock at night in a Hack∣ney-coach, few House-keepers being very willing to let their lodgings to such kind of Operators. As he was softly stalking up stairs in the dark, with the dead man in his arms, his burthen had like to have slipp'd from him, which he (to save from fal∣ing) grasp'd so hard about the belly, that it forced the wind through the <HI>Anus,</HI> with a noise exactly like the <HI>Crepitus</HI> of a living man. Crambe (who did not comprehend how this part of the Animal Oeconomy could remain in a dead man) was so terrified, that he threw down the body, ran up to his master, and had scarce breath to tell him what had happened. Martin with all his Philosophy could not prevail upon him to return to his post.—You may say what you please (quoth Crambe) no man alive ever broke wind more naturally; nay, he seemed to be mightily relieved by it.—The rol∣ling of the corpse down stairs made such a noise that it awaked the whole house. The maid shriek'd, the landlady cried out Thieves; but the Landlord, in his shirt as he was, taking a candle in one hand, and a drawn sword in the other, ven∣tured out of the Room. The maid with only a single petticoat ran up stairs, but spurning at the dead body, fell upon it in a swoon. Now the
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
landlord stood still and list'ned, then he looked be∣hind him, and ventured down in this manner one stair after another, till he came where lay his maid, as dead, upon another corpse unknown. The wife ran into the street and cried out Murder! the Watch ran in, while Martin and Crambe, hear∣ing all this uproar, were coming down stairs. The Watch imagined they were making their escape, seized them immediately, and carried them to a neighbouring Justice; where, upon searching them, several kind of knives and dreadful weapons were found upon them. The Justice first examined Crambe.—What is your Name? says the Justice. I have acquired (quoth Crambe) no great Name as yet; they call me Crambe or Crambo, no mat∣ter which, as to myself; though it may be some dispute to posterity.—What is yours and your Ma∣ster's profession? <Q>“It is our business to imbrue our hands in blood; we cut off the heads, and pull out the hearts of those that never injured us; we rip up big-belly'd women, and tear children limb from limb.”</Q> Martin endeavour∣ed to interrupt him; but the Justice, being strange∣ly astonished with the frankness of Crambe's Con∣fession, ordered him to proceed; upon which he made the following Speech.</P>
<P><Q>“”May it please your Worship, as touching the body of this man, I can answer each head that my accusers alledge against me, to a hair. They have hitherto talk'd like num-sculls without
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
brains; but if your Worship will not only give ear, but regard me with a favourable eye, I will not be brow-beaten by the supercilious looks of my adversaries, who now stand cheek by jowl by your Worship. I will prove to their faces, that their foul mouths have not opened their lips without a falsity; though they have showed their teeth as if they would bite off my nose. Now, Sir, that I may fairly slip my neck out of the collar, I beg this matter may not be slightly skined over. Tho' I have no man here to back me, I will unbosom myself, since Truth is on my side, and shall give them their bellies full, though they think they have me upon the hip. Whereas they say I came into their lodg∣ings, with arms, and murdered this man with∣out their Privity, I declare I had not the least finger in it; and since I am to stand upon my own legs, nothing of this matter shall be left till I set it upon a right foot. In the vein I am in, I cannot for my heart's blood and guts bear this usage: I shall not spare my lungs to defend my good name: I was ever reckoned a good liver; and I think I have the bowels of compassion. I ask but justice, and from the crown of my head to the soal of my foot I shall ever acknowledge myself your Worship's humble Servant.”</Q></P>
<P>The Justice stared, the Landlord and Landlady lifted up their eyes, and Martin fretted, while Crambe talk'd in this rambling incoherent man∣ner;
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
till at length Martin begg'd to be heard. It was with great difficulty that the Justice was con∣vinced, till they sent for the Finisher of human laws, of whom the Corpse had been purchased; who looking near the left ear, knew his own work, and gave Oath accordingly.</P>
<P>No sooner was Martin got home, but he fell into a passion at Crambe. <Q>“What Daemon, he cried, hath possessed thee, that thou wilt never forsake that impertinent custom of punning? Neither my counsel nor my example have thus misled thee; thou governest thyself by most er∣roneous Maxims.”</Q> Far from it (answers Crambe) my life is as orderly as my Dictionary, for by my Dictionary I order my life. I have made a Ka∣lendar of radical words for all the seasons, months, and days of the year: Every day I am under the dominion of a certain Word: but this day in par∣ticular I cannot be misled, for I am governed by one that rules all sexes, ages, conditions, nay all animals rational and irrational. Who is not go∣verned by the word <HI>Led?</HI> Our Noblemen and Drunkards are pimp-led, Physicians and Pulses fee-led, their Patients and Oranges pil-led, a New-married Man and an Ass are bride-led, an old-mar∣ried Man and a Pack-horse sad-led, Cats and Dice are rat-led, Swine and Nobility are sty-led, a Co∣quet and a Tinder-box are spark-led, a Lover and a Blunderer are grove-led. And that I may not
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
be tedious—Which thou art (replied Martin, stamping with his foot) which thou art, I say, be∣yond all human toleration. Such an unnatural, unaccountable, uncoherent, unintelligible, unpro∣fitable—There it is now! (interrupted Crambe) this is your Day for <HI>Uns.</HI> Martin could bear no longer—however, composing his Countenance, Come hither, he cried, there are five pounds, seventeen shillings and nine pence: thou hast been with me eight months, three weeks, two days, and four hours. Poor Crambe upon the receipt of his Salary, fell into tears, flung the money up∣on the ground, and burst forth in these words:—O Cicero, Cicero! if to pun be a crime, 'tis a crime I have learned from thee: O Bias, Bias! if to pun be a crime, by thy example was I bias'd.—Whereupon Martin (considering that one of the greatest of Orators, and even a Sage of Greece had punned) hesitated, relented, and re∣instated Crambe in his Service.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Martin became a great Critick.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a most peculiar Talent in Martinus, to convert every Trifle into a serious thing, either in the way of Life, or in Learning. This can no
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
way be better exemplified, than in the effect which the Puns of Crambe had on the Mind and Studies of Martinus. He conceived, that somewhat of a like Talent to this of Crambe, of <HI>assembling paral∣lel sounds,</HI> either <HI>syllables,</HI> or <HI>words,</HI> might conduce to the Emendation and Correction of <HI>Ancient Au∣thors,</HI> if applied to their Works, with the same <HI>diligence,</HI> and the same <HI>liberty.</HI> He resolved to try first upon Virgil, Horace, and Terence; con∣cluding, that, if the <HI>most correct</HI> Authors could be so served with any reputation to the Critick, the amendment and alteration of <HI>all the rest</HI> would ea∣sily follow; whereby a new, a vast, nay boundless Field of Glory would be opened to the true and <HI>ab∣solute Critic.</HI></P>
<P>This Specimen on Virgil he has given us, in the Addenda to his Notes on the Dunciad. His Terence and Horace are in every body's hands, un∣der the names of Richard B—ley, and Francis H—re. And we have convincing proofs that the late Edition of Milton published in the name of the former of these, was in truth the Work of no other than our Scriblerus.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Martinus's uncommon Practice of Phy∣sick, and how he apply'd himself to the Diseases of the Mind.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it is high time to return to the History of the Progress of Martinus in the Studies of Physick, and to enumerate some at least of the many Discoveries and Experiments he made therein.</P>
<P>One of the first was his Method of investigating latent Distempers, by the sagacious Quality of <HI>Setting-Dogs</HI> and <HI>Pointers.</HI> The success, and the Adventures that befel him, when he walked with these Animals, to smell them out in the Parks and publick places about London, are what we would willingly relate; but that his own Account, toge∣ther with a <HI>List of those Gentlemen and Ladies</HI> at whom they made a <HI>Full set,</HI> will be published in time convenient. There will also be added the Representation, which, on occasion of one distem∣per which was become almost epidemical, he thought himself obliged to lay before both Houses of Parliament, intitled, <HI>A Proposal for a General Flux,</HI> to exterminate at one blow the P—x out of this kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="174"/>
But being weary of all practice on <HI>foetid Bodies;</HI> from a certain niceness of Constitution, (especially when he attended Dr. Woodward thro' a Twelve∣months course of Vomition) he determined to leave it off entirely, and to apply himself only to dis∣eases of the <HI>Mind.</HI> He attempted to find out Spe∣cificks for all the <HI>Passions;</HI> and as other Physicians throw their Patients into sweats, vomits, purga∣tions, etc. he cast them into Love, Hatred, Hope, Fear, Joy, Grief, etc. And indeed the great Irre∣gularity of the Passions in the English Nation, was the chief motive that induced him to apply his whole studies, while he continued among us, to the Diseases of the Mind.</P>
<P>To this purpose he directed, in the first place, his late acquired skill in <HI>Anatomy.</HI> He consider'd <HI>Virtues</HI> and <HI>Vices</HI> as certain Habits which proceed from the natural Formation and Structure of par∣ticular parts of the body. A Bird flies because it has Wings, a Duck swims because it is web-foot∣ed: and there can be no question but the adun∣city of the pounces and beaks of the Hawks, as well as the length of the fangs, the sharpness of the teeth, and the strength of the crural and mas∣seter-muscles in Lions and Tygers, are the cause of the great and habitual Immorality of those Ani∣mals.</P>
<P>1st, He observed, that the Soul and Body mu∣tually operate upon each other, and therefore if
<PB N="169" REF="175"/>
you deprive the Mind of the outward Instruments whereby she usually expresseth that Passion, you will in time abate the Passion itself, in like manner as Castration abates Lust.</P>
<P>2dly, That the Soul in mankind expresseth every Passion by the Motion of some particular <HI>Muscles.</HI></P>
<P>3dly, That all Muscles grow stronger and thicker by being <HI>much used;</HI> therefore the habitual Passions may be discerned in particular persons by the <HI>strength</HI> and <HI>bigness</HI> of the Muscles used in the expression of that Passion.</P>
<P>4thly, That a Muscle may be strengthen'd or weaken'd by weakning or strength'ning the force of its Antagonist. These things premised, he took notice,</P>
<P>That <HI>Complaisance, humility, assent, approba∣tion,</HI> and <HI>civility,</HI> were expressed by nodding the head and bowing the body forward: on the con∣trary, <HI>dissent, dislike, refusal, pride,</HI> and <HI>arrogance,</HI> were marked by tossing the head, and bending the body backwards: which two Passions of <HI>assent</HI> and <HI>dissent</HI> the Latins rightly express'd by the words <HI>adnuere</HI> and <HI>abnuere.</HI> Now he observed that com∣plaisant and civil people had the Flexors of the head very strong; but in the proud and insolent there was a great over-balance of strength in the Exten∣sors of the Neck and the Muscles of the Back, from
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
whence they perform with great facility the mo∣tion of <HI>tossing,</HI> but with great difficulty that of <HI>bowing,</HI> and therefore have justly acquired the Title of <HI>stiff-neck'd:</HI> In order to reduce such per∣sons to a just balance, he judged that the pair of Muscles called <HI>Recti interni,</HI> the Mastoidal, with other flexors of the head, neck, and body must be strengthen'd; their Antagonists, the <HI>Splenii Com∣plexi,</HI> and the Extensors of the Spine weaken'd: For which purpose Nature herself seems to have directed mankind to correct this Muscular Immo∣rality by tying such fellows <HI>Neck and heels.</HI></P>
<P>Contrary to this, is the pernicious Custom of Mothers, who abolish the natural Signature of Mo∣desty in their Daughters, by teaching them <HI>tossing</HI> and <HI>bridling,</HI> rather than the bashful posture of <HI>stooping,</HI> and <HI>hanging down the head.</HI> Martinus charged all husbands to take notice of the <HI>Posture of the Head</HI> of such as they courted to Matrimony, as that upon which their future happiness did much depend.</P>
<P><HI>Flatterers,</HI> who have the flexor Muscles so strong that they are always bowing and cringing, he sup∣posed might in some measure be corrected by be∣ing tied down upon a Tree by the back, like the children of the Indians; which doctrine was strongly confirm'd by his observing the strength of the <HI>levatores Scapulae:</HI> This Muscle is called the Muscle of <HI>patience,</HI> because in that affection of Mind people shrug and raise up the shoulder to the
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
tip of the ear. This Muscle also be observed to be exceedingly strong and large in <HI>Henpeck'd Hus∣bands,</HI> in <HI>Italians,</HI> and in <HI>English Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuance of his Theory, he supposed the <HI>constrictors</HI> of the <HI>Eye-lids,</HI> must be strengthen'd in the supercilious, the <HI>abductors</HI> in drunkards and contemplative men, who have the same steddy and grave motion of the eye. That the <HI>buccinators</HI> or blowers up of the <HI>cheeks,</HI> and the <HI>dilators</HI> of the <HI>Nose,</HI> were too strong in Cholerick people; and therefore Nature here again directed us to a reme∣dy, which was to correct such extraordinary dila∣tation by <HI>pulling by the Nose.</HI></P>
<P>The rolling amorous Eye, in the passion of Love, might be corrected by frequently looking thro' glasses. Impertinent fellows that jump upon Tables, and cut capers, might be cur'd by relax∣ing medicines applied to the <HI>Calves</HI> of their <HI>Legs,</HI> which in such people are too strong.</P>
<P>But there were two cases which he reckoned extremely difficult. First, <HI>Affectation,</HI> in which there were so many Muscles of the bum, thighs, belly, neck, back, and the whole body, all in a false tone, that it required an impracticable mul∣tiplicity of applications.</P>
<P>The second case was immoderate <HI>Laughter:</HI> When any of that risible species were brought to the Doctor, and when he consider'd what an infi∣nity of Muscles these laughing Rascals threw into a convulsive motion at the same time; whether
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
we regard the spasms of the Diaphragm and all the muscles of respiration, the horrible <HI>rictus</HI> of the mouth, the distortion of the lower jaw, the crisp∣ing of the nose, twinkling of the eyes, or sphaeri∣cal convexity of the cheeks, with the tremulous succussion of the whole human body: when he considered, I say, all this, he used to cry out <HI>Casus plane deplorabilis!</HI> and give such Patients over.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The case of a young Nobleman at Court, with the Doctor's Prescription for the same.</HEAD>
<P>AN eminent Instance of Martinus's Sagacity in discovering the Distempers of the Mind, appeared in the case of a young Nobleman at Court, who was observed to grow extremely affected in his speech, and whimsical in all his behaviour. He began to ask odd questions, talk in verse to himself, shut himself up from his friends, and be accessible to none, but Flatterers, Poets, and Pick∣pockets; till his Relations and old Acquaintance judged him to be so far gone, as to be a fit Patient for the Doctor.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="179"/>
As soon as he had heard and examined all the symptoms, he pronounced his distemper to be <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>His friends assured him that they had with great care observed all his motions, and were perfectly satisfied there was no Woman in the case. Scrib∣lerus was as positive that he was desperately in love with some person or other. <Q>“How can that be? (said his Aunt, who came to ask the advice) when he converses almost with none but him∣self?”</Q> Say you so? he replied, why then he is in love with himself, one of the most common cases in the world. I am astonished, people do not enough attend this Disease, which has the same causes and symptoms, and admits of the same cure with the other: especially since here the case of the Patient is the more helpless and deplorable of the two, as this unfortunate passion is more blind than the other. There are people, who discover from their very youth a most amorous inclination to themselves; which is unhappily nurs'd by such Mothers, as, with their good will, would never suf∣fer their children to be <HI>crossed in love.</HI> Ease, lux∣ury, and idleness, blow up this flame as well as the other: Constant opportunities of conversation with the person beloved (the greatest of incentives) are here impossible to be prevented. Bawds and pimps in the other love, will be perpetually doing kind offices, speaking a good word for the party, and carry about Billet doux. Therefore I ask you,
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
Madam, if this Gentleman has not been much frequented by Flatterers, and a sort of people who bring him dedications and verses? <Q>“O Lord! Sir, (quoth the Aunt) the house is haunted with them.”</Q>—There it is (replied Scriblerus) those are the bawds and pimps that go between a man and himself. Are there no civil Ladies, that tell him he dresses well, has a gentlemanly air, and the like? "Why truly, Sir, my Nephew is not auk∣ward"—Look you, Madam, this is a misfortune to him: In former days these sort of lovers were hap∣py in one respect, that they never had any rivals, but of late they have all the Ladies so—Be pleased to answer a few questions more. Whom does he generally talk of? Himself, quoth the Aunt.—Whose wit and breeding does he most commend? His own, quoth the Aunt.—Whom does he write letters to? Himself.—Whom does he dream of? All the dreams I ever heard were of himself.—Whom is he ogling yonder? Himself in his look∣ing-glass.—Why does he throw back his head in that languishing posture? Only to be blest with a smile of himself as he passes by.—Does he ever steal a kiss from himself, by biting his lips? Oh con∣tinually, till they are perfect vermillion.—Have you observed him to use Familiarities with any body? <Q>“With none but himself: he often em∣braces himself with folded arms, he claps his hand often upon his hip, nay sometimes thrusts it into his breast.”</Q></P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="181"/>
Madam, said the Doctor, all these are strong symptoms; but there remain a few more. Has this amorous gentleman presented himself with any Love-toys; such as gold Snuff-boxes, repeat∣ing Watches, or Tweezer-cases? those are things that in time will soften the most obdurate heart. <Q>“”Not only so (said the Aunt) but he bought the other day a very fine brillant diamond Ring for his own wearing.—Nay, if he has accepted of this Ring,</Q> the intrigue is very forward indeed, and it is high time for friends to interpose.—Pray Ma∣dam, a word or two more: Is he jealous that his acquaintance do not behave themselves with respect enough? will he bear jokes and innocent freedoms? <Q>“By no means; a familiar appellation makes him angry; if you shake him a little roughly by the hand, he is in a rage; but if you chuck him under the chin, he will return you a box on the ear.”</Q>—Then the case is plain: he has the true Pathognomick sign of Love, <HI>Jealousy;</HI> for no body will suffer his mistress to be treated at that rate. Madam, upon the whole this Case is extremely dangerous. There are some people who are far gone in this passion of self-love; but then they keep a <HI>very secret Intrigue</HI> with themselves, and hide it from all the world besides. But this Pa∣tient has not the least care of the Reputation of his Beloved, he is downright scandalous in his beha∣viour with himself; he is enchanted, bewitch'd,
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
and almost past cure. However let the following methods be try'd upon him.</P>
<P>First, let him *** <HI>Hiatus.</HI> *** Secondly, let him wear a Bob-wig. Thirdly, shun the company of flatterers, nay of ceremonious people, and of all Frenchmen in general. It would not be amiss if he travelled over England in a Stage-coach, and made the Tour of Holland in a Track-scoute. Let him return the Snuff-boxes, Tweezer-cases (and particularly the Diamond Ring) which he has re∣ceived from himself. Let some knowing friend re∣present to him the many vile Qualities of this Mi∣stress of his: let him be shewn that her Extrava∣gance, Pride, and Prodigality will infallibly bring him to a morsel of bread: Let it be proved, that he has been false to himself, and if Treachery is not a sufficient cause to discard a Mistress, what is? In short let him be made to see that no mortal be∣sides himself either loves or can suffer this Crea∣ture. Let all Looking-glasses, polished Toys, and even clean Plates be removed from him, for fear of bringing back the admired object. Let him be taught to put off all those tender airs, affected smiles, languishing looks, wanton tosses of the head, coy motions of the body, that mincing gait, soft tone of voice, and all that enchanting wo∣man-like behaviour, that has made him the charm of his own eyes, and the object of his own adora∣tion. Let him surprize the Beauty he adores at a
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
disadvantage, survey himself naked, divested of ar∣tificial charms, and he will find himself a forked stradling Animal, with bandy legs, a short neck, a dun hide, and a pot-belly. It would be yet bet∣ter, if he took a strong purge once a week, in or∣der to contemplate himself in that condition: at which time it will be convenient to make use of the Letters, Dedications, etc. abovesaid. Some∣thing like this has been observed by Lucretius and others to be a powerful remedy in the case of Wo∣men. If all this will not do, I must e'en leave the poor man to his destiny. Let him <HI>marry him∣self,</HI> and when he is condemned eternally to him∣self, perhaps he may run to the next pond to get rid of himself, the Fate of most violent Self∣lovers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How Martinus endeavoured to find out the Seat of the Soul, and of his Corres∣pondence with the Free-Thinkers.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Design of Martin to investigate the Dis∣eases of the Mind, he thought nothing so ne∣cessary as an Enquiry after the <HI>Seat</HI> of the <HI>Soul;</HI> in which at first he laboured under great uncertain∣ties. Sometimes he was of opinion that it lodged
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
in the Brain, sometimes in the Stomach, and some∣times in the Heart. Afterwards he thought it ab∣surd to confine that sovereign Lady to one apart∣ment, which made him infer that she shifted it according to the several functions of life: The Brain was her Study, the Heart her State-room, and the Stomach her Kitchen. But as he saw se∣veral Offices of life went on at the same time, he was forced to give up this Hypothesis also. He now conjectured it was more for the dignity of the Soul to perform several operations by her little Mi∣nisters, the <HI>Animal Spirits,</HI> from whence it was natural to conclude, that she resides in different parts according to different Inclinations, Sexes, Ages, and Professions. Thus in Epicures he seated her in the mouth of the Stomach, Philoso∣phers have her in the Brain, Soldiers in their Heart, Women in their Tongues, Fidlers in their Fingers, and Rope-dancers in their Toes. At length he grew fond of the <HI>Glandula Pinealis,</HI> dissecting ma∣ny Subjects to find out the different Figure of this Gland, from whence he might discover the cause of the different Tempers in mankind. He sup∣posed that in factious and restless-spirited people he should find it sharp and pointed, allowing no room for the Soul to repose herself; that in quiet Tempers it was flat, smooth, and soft, affording to the Soul as it were an easy cushion. He was con∣firmed in this by observing, that Calves and Philo∣sophers, Tygers and Statesmen, Foxes and Sharp∣ers,
<PB N="179" REF="185"/>
Peacocks and Fops, Cock-Sparrows and Co∣quets, Monkeys and Players, Courtiers and Spa∣niels, Moles and Misers, exactly resemble one an∣ther in the conformation of the <HI>Pineal Gland.</HI> He did not doubt likewise to find the same resem∣blance in Highwaymen and Conquerors: In order to satisfy himself in which, it was, that he pur∣chased the body of one of the first Species (as hath been before related) at Tyburn, hoping in time to have the happiness of one of the latter too, under his Anatomical knife.</P>
<P>We must not omit taking notice here, that these Enquiries into the <HI>Seat</HI> of the <HI>Soul</HI> gave occasion to his first correspondence with the society of <HI>Free-Thinkers,</HI> who were then in their infancy in Eng∣land, and so much taken with the promising en∣dowments of Martin, that they ordered their Se∣cretary to write him the following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the learned Inquisitor into Nature, <HI>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS:</HI> The Society of <HI>Free-Thinkers</HI> greeting.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Grecian Coffee-House, <DATE>May 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with unspeakable joy we have heard of your inquisitive Genius, and we think it great pity that it should not be better employed, than in looking after that Theological Non-entity com∣monly call'd the <HI>Soul:</HI> Since after all your enqui∣ries, it will appear you have lost your labour in
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
seeking the Residence of such a Chimera, that ne∣ver had being but in the brains of some dreaming Philosophers. Is it not <HI>Demonstration</HI> to a person of your Sense, that, since <HI>you cannot find it,</HI> there is <HI>no such thing?</HI> In order to set so hopeful a Ge∣nius right in this matter, we have sent you an an∣swer to the ill-grounded Sophisms of those crack∣brain'd fellows, and likewise an easy <HI>mechanical explication</HI> of <HI>Perception</HI> or <HI>Thinking.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This whole Chapter is an inimitable ridicule on <HI>Collins's</HI> arguments against <HI>Clarke,</HI> to prove the Soul only a Quality.</NOTE> One of their chief Arguments is, that <HI>Self-consciousness</HI> cannot inhere in any system of Mat∣ter, because all matter is made up of several di∣stinct beings, which never can make up one indi∣vidual thinking being.</P>
<P>This is easily answered by a familiar instance. In every <HI>Jack</HI> there is a <HI>meat-roasting</HI> Quality, which neither resides in the fly, nor in the weight, nor in any particular wheel of the Jack, but is the result of the whole composition: So in an Animal, the Self-consciousness is not a real Quality inhe∣rent in one Being (any more than meat-roasting in a Jack) but the result of several Modes or Quali∣ties in the same subject. As the fly, the wheels, the chain, the weight, the cords, etc. make one Jack, so the several parts of the body make one Animal. As perception or consciousness is said to be inherent in this Animal, so is meat-roasting said to be inherent in the Jack. As sensation, reason∣ing,
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
volition, memory, etc. are the several Modes of thinking; so roasting of beef, roasting of mut∣ton, roasting of pullets, geese, turkeys, etc. are the several modes of meat-roasting. And as the gene∣ral Quality of meat-roasting, with its several mo∣difications as to beef, mutton, pullets, etc. does not inhere in any one part of the Jack; so neither does Consciousness, with its several Modes of sen∣sation, intellection, volition, etc. inhere in any one, but is the result from the mechanical composition of the whole Animal.</P>
<P>Just so, the Quality or Disposition in a Fiddle to play tunes, with the several Modifications of this <HI>tune-playing</HI> quality in playing of Preludes, Sara∣bands, Jigs, and Gavotts, are as much real qua∣lities in the Instrument, as the Thought or the Imagination is in the mind of the Person that com∣poses them.</P>
<P>The Parts (say they) of an animal body are perpetually changed, and the fluids which seem to be the subject of consciousness, are in a perpe∣tual circulation; so that the same individual parti∣cles do not remain in the Brain; from whence it will follow, that the idea of Individual Conscious∣ness must be constantly translated from one parti∣cle of matter to another, whereby the particle A, for example, must not only be conscious, but con∣scious that it is the same being with the particle B that went before.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188"/>
We answer, this is only a fallacy of the imagi∣nation, and is to be understood in no other sense than that maxim of the English Law, that the <HI>King never dies.</HI> This power of thinking, self∣moving, and governing the whole Machine, is communicated from every Particle to its immedi∣ate Successor; who, as soon as he is gone, imme∣diately takes upon him the Government, which still preserves the Unity of the whole System.</P>
<P>They make a great noise about this Individua∣lity: how a man is conscious to himself that he is the same Individual he was twenty years ago; not∣withstanding the flux state of the Particles of mat∣ter that compose his body. We think this is ca∣pable of a very plain answer, and may be easily illustrated by a familiar example.</P>
<P>Sir John Cutler had a pair of black worsted stock∣ings, which his maid darn'd so often with silk, that they became at last a pair of silk stockings. Now supposing those stockings of Sir John's endued with some degree of Consciousness at every particular darning, they would have been sensible, that they were the same individual pair of stockings both be∣fore and after the darning; and this sensation would have continued in them through all the succession of darnings; and yet after the last of all, there was not perhaps one thread left of the first pair of stock∣ings, but they were grown to be silk stockings, as was said before.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="189"/>
And whereas it is affirmed, that every animal is conscious of some individual self-moving, self-determining principle; it is answered, that, as in a House of Commons all things are determined by a <HI>Majority,</HI> so it is in every Animal system. As that which determines the House is said to be the rea∣son of the whole assembly; it is no otherwise with thinking Beings, who are determined by the greater force of several particles; which, like so many unthinking Members, compose one thinking Sy∣stem.</P>
<P>And whereas it is likewise objected, that Pu∣nishments cannot be just that are not inflicted up∣on the same individual, which cannot subsist with∣out the notion of a spiritual substance: We re∣ply, that this is no greater difficulty to conceive, than that a Corporation, which is likewise a flux body, may be punished for the faults, and liable to the debts, of their Predecessors.</P>
<P>We proceed now to explain, by the structure of the Brain, the several Modes of thinking. It is well known to Anatomists that the Brain is a <HI>Congeries</HI> of Glands, that separate the finer parts of the blood, called Animal Spirits; that a Gland is nothing but a Canal of a great length, vari∣ously intorted and wound up together. From the Arieta lion and Motion of the Spirits in those Ca∣nals, proceed all the different sorts of Thoughts. Simple Ideas are produced by the motion of the Spirits in one simple Canal: when two of these
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
Canals disembogue themselves into one, they make what we call a Proposition; and when two of these propositional Chanels empty themselves into a third, they form a Syllogism, or a Ratiocina∣tion. Memory is performed in a distinct apart∣ment of the brain, made up of vessels similar, and like situated to the ideal, propositional, and syllo∣gistical vessels, in the primary parts of the brain. After the same manner it is easy to explain the other modes of thinking; as also why some peo∣ple think so wrong and perversely, which proceeds from the bad configuration of those Glands. Some for example, are born without the propositional or syllogistical Canals; in others, that reason ill, they are of unequal capacities; in dull fellows, of too great a length, whereby the motion of the spirits is retarded; in trifling genius's, weak and small; in the over-refining spirits, too much in∣torted and winding; and so of the rest.</P>
<P>We are so much persuaded of the truth of this our Hypothesis, that we have employed one of our Members, a great Virtuoso at Nuremberg, to make a sort of an Hydraulick Engine, in which a chemical liquor resembling blood, is driven thro' elastick chanels resembling arteries and veins, by the force of an Embolus like the heart, and wrought by a pneumatick Machine of the nature of the lungs, with ropes and pullies, like the nerves, tendons, and muscles: And we are persuad∣ed that this our artificial Man will not only walk,
<PB N="185" REF="191" MS="y"/>
and speak, and perform most of the outward ac∣tions of the animal life, but (being wound up once a week) will perhaps reason as well as most of your Country Parsons.</P>
<P>We wait with the utmost impatience for the honour of having you a Member of our Society, and beg leave to assure you that we are, etc.</P>
<P>What return Martin made to this obliging Let∣ter we must defer to another occasion: let it suf∣fice at present to tell, that Crambe was in a great rage at them, for stealing (as he thought) a hint from his <HI>Theory of Syllogisms,</HI> without doing him the honour so much as to mention him. He ad∣vised his Master by no means to enter into their Society, unless they would give him sufficient se∣curity, to bear him harmless from any thing that might happen after this present life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Secession of Martinus, and some Hint of his Travels.</HEAD>
<P>IT was in the year 1699 that Martin set out on his <HI>Travels.</HI> Thou wilt certainly be very cu∣rious to know what they were. It is not yet time
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
to inform thee. But what hints I am at liberty to give, I will.</P>
<P>Thou shalt know then, that in his first Voyage he was carried by a prosperous Storm, to a Dis∣covery of the Remains of the ancient <HI>Pygmaean</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>That in his second, he was as happily ship∣wreck'd on the Land of the <HI>Giants,</HI> now the most humane people in the world.</P>
<P>That in his third Voyage, he discover'd a whole Kingdom of <HI>Philosophers,</HI> who govern by the <HI>Ma∣thematicks;</HI> with whose admirable Schemes and Projects he returned to benefit his own dear Coun∣try; but had the misfortune to find them reject∣ed by the envious Ministers of <HI>Queen Anne,</HI> and himself sent treacherously away.</P>
<P>And hence it is, that in his fourth Voyage he discovers a Vein of Melancholy proceeding almost to a Disgust of his Species; but above all, a mor∣tal Detestation to the whole flagitious Race of <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> and a final Resolution not to give in any <HI>Memorial</HI> to the <HI>Secretary of State,</HI> in order to sub∣ject the Lands he discovered to the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now if, by these hints, the Reader can help himself to a farther discovery of the Nature and Contents of these Travels, he is welcome to as much light as they afford him; I am obliged, by all the tyes of honour, not to speak more openly.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="193" MS="y"/>
But if any man shall ever see such very extra∣ordinary Voyages, into such very extraordinary Nations, which manifest the most distinguishing marks of a Philosopher, a Politician, and a Legi∣slator; and can imagine them to belong to a <HI>Sur∣geon of a Ship,</HI> or a <HI>Captain</HI> of a <HI>Merchantman,</HI> let him remain in his Ignorance.</P>
<P>And whoever he be, that shall farther observe, in every page of such a book, that cordial <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> that inviolable <HI>Regard</HI> to <HI>Truth,</HI> that <HI>Passion</HI> for his <HI>dear Country,</HI> and that particular at∣tachment to the excellent Princess Queen <HI>Anne;</HI> surely that man deserves to be pitied, if by all those visible Signs and Characters, he cannot distinguish and acknowledge the Great <HI>Scriblerus</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gulliver</HI>'s <HI>Travels</HI> were first intended as a part of Scriblerus's Memoirs.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Discoveries and Works of the Great Scriblerus, made and to be made, writ∣ten and to be written, known and un∣known.</HEAD>
<P>HERE therefore, at this great Period, we end our first Book. And here, O Reader, we entreat thee utterly to forget all thou hast hi∣therto read, and to cast thy eyes only forward, to
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
that boundless Field the next shall open unto thee; the fruits of which (if thine, or our sins do not prevent) are to spread and multiply over this our work, and over all the face of the Earth.</P>
<P>In the mean time, know what thou owest, and what thou yet may'st owe, to this excellent Per∣son, this Prodigy of our Age; who may well be called, <HI>The Philosopher of Ultimate Causes,</HI> since by a Sagacity peculiar to himself, he hath discover'd Effects in their very Cause; and without the tri∣vial helps of Experiments, or Observations, hath been the Inventor of most of the modern Systems and Hypotheses.</P>
<P>He hath enriched Mathematicks with many precise and geometrical <HI>Quadratures</HI> of the <HI>Circle.</HI> He first discovered the <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Gravity,</HI> and the intestine <HI>Motion</HI> of <HI>Fluids.</HI></P>
<P>To him we owe all the observations on the <HI>Par∣allax</HI> of the <HI>Pole-Star,</HI> and all the new <HI>Theories</HI> of the <HI>Deluge.</HI></P>
<P>He it was, that first taught the right use some∣times of the <HI>Fuga Vacui,</HI> and sometimes of the <HI>Ma∣teria Subtilis,</HI> in resolving the grand Phaenomena of Nature.</P>
<P>He it was, that first found out the <HI>Palpability</HI> of <HI>Colours;</HI> and by the delicacy of his Touch, could distinguish the different Vibrations of the heteroge∣neous Rays of Light.</P>
<P>His were the Projects of <HI>Perpetuum Mobiles, Flying Engines,</HI> and <HI>Pacing Saddles;</HI> the Method
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
of discovering the <HI>Longitude</HI> by <HI>Bomb-Vessels,</HI> and of increasing the <HI>Trade-Wind</HI> by vast plantations of <HI>Reeds</HI> and <HI>Sedges.</HI></P>
<P>I shall mention only a few of his Philosophical and Mathematical Works.</P>
<P N="1">1. A compleat Digest of the Laws of Nature, with a Review of those that are obsolete or repeal∣ed, and of those that are ready to be renew'd and put in force.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Mechanical Explication of the Formation of the Universe, according to the Epicurean Hy∣pothesis.</P>
<P N="3">3. An Investigation of the Quantity of real Mat∣ter in the Universe, with the proportion of the specifick Gravity of solid Matter to that of fluid.</P>

<P N="5">5. A Computation of the Duration of the Sun, and how long it will last before it be burn'd out.</P>
<P N="6">6. A Method to apply the Force arising from the immense Velocity of <HI>Light</HI> to mechanical pur∣poses.</P>
<P N="7">7. An answer to the question of a curious Gen∣tleman; How long a <HI>New Star</HI> was lighted up before its appearance to the Inhabitants of our earth? To which is subjoined a Calculation, how
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
much the Inhabitants of the <HI>Moon</HI> eat for Supper; considering that they pass a Night equal to fifteen of our natural days.</P>
<P N="8">8. A Demonstration of the natural Dominion of the Inhabitants of the Earth over those of the Moon, if ever an intercourse should be opened be∣tween them. With a Proposal of a <HI>Partition-Treaty,</HI> among the earthly Potentates, in case of such discovery.</P>
<P N="9">9. Tide-Tables, for a Comet, that is to approxi∣mate towards the Earth.</P>
<P N="10">10. The Number of the Inhabitants of London determined by the Reports of the Gold-finders, and the Tonnage of their Carriages; with allow∣ance for the extraordinary quantity of the <HI>Ingesta</HI> and <HI>Egesta</HI> of the people of England, and a de∣duction of what is left under dead walls, and dry ditches.</P>
<P>It will from hence be evident, how much all his Studies were directed to the universal Benefit of Mankind. Numerous have been his Projects to this end, of which <HI>Two</HI> alone will be sufficient to show the amazing Grandeur of his Genius. The first was a Proposal, by a general contribution of all Princes, to pierce the first crust or <HI>Nucleus</HI> of this our <HI>Earth,</HI> quite through, to the next concentri∣cal Sphere. The advantage he proposed from it was, to find the <HI>Parallax</HI> of the <HI>Fixt Stars;</HI> but chiefly to refute Sir Isaac Newton's Theory of <HI>Gra∣vity,</HI>
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
and Mr. Halley's of the <HI>Variations.</HI> The se∣cond was, to build <HI>Two Poles</HI> to the <HI>Meridian,</HI> with immense Light-houses on the top of them; to supply the defect of Nature, and to make the Longitude as easy to be calculated as the Latitude. Both these he could not but think very practica∣ble, by the Power of all the Potentates of the World.</P>
<P>May we presume after these to mention, how he descended from the sublime to the beneficial parts of Knowledge, and particularly his extraor∣dinary practice of <HI>Physick.</HI> From the Age, Com∣plexion, or Weight of the person given, he con∣trived to prescribe at a distance, as well as at a Patient's bed-side. He taught the way to many modern Physicians, to cure their Patients by <HI>In∣tuition,</HI> and to others to cure <HI>without looking on them at all.</HI> He projected a Menstruum to dissolve the Stone, made of Dr. Woodward's <HI>Universal Deluge∣water.</HI> His also was the device to relieve Con∣sumptive or Asthmatick persons by bringing fresh Air out of the Country to Town, by pipes of the nature of the Recipients of Air-pumps: And to introduce the Native air of a man's country into any other in which he should travel, with a sea∣sonable Intromission of such Steams as were most familiar to him; to the inexpressible comfort of many Scotsmen, Laplanders, and white Bears.</P>
<P>In <HI>Physiognomy,</HI> his penetration is such, that from the <HI>Picture</HI> only of any person, he can write
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
his <HI>Life;</HI> and from the features of the Parents, draw the Portrait of any Child that is to be born.</P>
<P>Nor hath he been so enrapt in these Studies, as to neglect the Polite Arts of Painting, Architec∣ture, Musick, Poetry, etc. It was he that gave the first hint to our modern <HI>Painters,</HI> to improve the <HI>Likeness</HI> of their Portraits by the use of such <HI>Co∣lours</HI> as would faithfully and constantly accompany the <HI>Life,</HI> not only in its present state, but in all its alterations, decays, age, and death itself.</P>
<P>In <HI>Architecture,</HI> he builds not with so much regard to present symmetry or conveniency, as with a Thought well worthy a true lover of Antiquity, to wit, the noble effect the Building will have to posterity, when it shall fall and become a Ruin.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Music,</HI> I think Heidegger has not the face to deny that he has been much beholden to his Scores.</P>
<P>In <HI>Poetry,</HI> he hath appeared under a hundred different names, of which we may one day give a Catalogue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Politicks,</HI> his Writings are of a peculiar Cast, for the most part Ironical, and the Drift of them often so delicate and refin'd as to be mistaken by the vulgar. He once went so far as to write a Per∣suasive to people to eat their own Children, which was so little understood as to be taken in ill part <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Swift's ironical tract on that subject.</NOTE>. He has often written against <HI>Liberty</HI> in the name
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
of <HI>Freeman</HI> and <HI>Algernoon Sydney,</HI> in vindication of the Measures of <HI>Spain</HI> under that of <HI>Raleigh,</HI> and in praise of <HI>Corruption</HI> under those of <HI>Cato</HI> and <HI>Publicola.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that at his last departure from Eng∣land, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> apprehending lest any of these might be perverted to the Scan∣dal of the weak, or Encouragement of the flagi∣tious, he cast them all, without mercy, into a Bog-house near <HI>St. James's.</HI> Some however have been with great diligence recover'd, and fish'd up with a hook and line, by the Ministerial Writers, which make at present the great Ornaments of their works.</P>
<P>Whatever he judged beneficial to Mankind, he constantly communicated (not only during his stay among us, but ever since his absence) by some method or other in which Ostentation had no part. With what incredible Modesty he concealed him∣self, is known to numbers of those to whom he addressed sometimes Epistles, sometimes Hints, sometimes whole Treatises, Advices to Friends, Projects to First Ministers, Letters to Members of Parliament, Accounts to the Royal Society, and innumerable others.</P>
<P>All these will be vindicated to the true Au∣thor, in the Course of these Memoirs. I may ven∣ture to say they cannot be unacceptable to any, but to those, who will appear too much concern∣ed
<PB N="194" REF="200" MS="y"/>
as <HI>Plagiaries,</HI> to be admitted as <HI>Judges.</HI> Where∣fore we warn the publick, to take particular no∣tice of all such as manifest any indecent Passion at the appearance of this Work, as Persons most cer∣tainly involved in the Guilt.</P>

<P><HI>Memoirs.]</HI> Mr. Pope, Dr. Arbuthnot, and Dr. Swift pro∣jected to write a satire, in conjunction, <HI>on the abuses of human learning;</HI> and to make it the better received, they proposed to do it in the manner of Cervantes (the original author of this species of satire) under the history of some feigned adventures. They had observed those <HI>abuses</HI> still kept their ground against all that the ablest and gravest Authors could say to discredit them;</P>
<P>they concluded therefore, the force of ridicule was wanting to quicken their disgrace; which was here in its place, when the abuses had been already detected by sober reasoning; and <HI>Truth</HI> in no danger to suffer by the <HI>premature</HI> use of so powerful an instrument. But the separation of our Author's friends, which soon after happened, with the death of one and the infirmities of the other, put a final stop to their project, when they had only drawn out an imperfect essay towards it, under the title of the <HI>First book of the Memoirs of Scriblerus.</HI></P>
<P>Polite letters never lost more than in the defeat of this scheme, in which, each of this illustrious triumvirate would have found exercise for his own peculiar talent; besides constant employ∣ment, for that they all had in common.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IT hath been long (my dear Countrymen) the subject of my concern and surprize, that whereas numberless Poets, Critics, and Orators have compiled and digested the Art of ancient Poesy, there hath not arisen among us one person so publick-spirited, as to perform the like for the Modern. Although it is universally known, that our every-way industrious Moderns, both in the Weight of their writings, and in the Velocity of their judgments, do so infinitely excel the said An∣cients.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, too true it is, that while a plain and direct road is paved to their <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Sublime; no track has been yet chalk'd out, to arrive at our <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or Profund. The Latins, as they came between the Greeks and Us, make use of the word <HI>Altitudo,</HI> which implies equally height and depth. Wherefore considering with no small grief, how ma∣ny promising Genius's of this age are wandering (as
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>
I may say) in the dark without a guide, I have undertaken this arduous but necessary task, to lead them as it were by the hand, and step by step, the gentle down-hill way to the Bathos; the bot∣tom, the end, the central point, the <HI>non plus ul∣tra,</HI> of true Modern Poesy!</P>
<P>When I consider (my dear Countrymen) the extent, fertility, and populousness of our Low∣lands of Parnassus, the flourishing state of our Trade, and the plenty of our Manufacture; there are two reflections which administer great occasion of surprize: The one, that all dignities and honours should be bestowed upon the exceeding few mea∣ger inhabitants of the Top of the mountain; the other, that our own nation should have arrived to that pitch of greatness it now possesses, without any regular System of Laws. As to the first, it is with great pleasure I have observed of late the gradual decay of Delicacy and Refinement among mankind, who are become too reasonable to re∣quire that we should labour with infinite pains to come up to the taste of these Mountaineers, when they without any may condescend to ours. But as we have now an unquestionable Majority on our side, I doubt not but we shall shortly be able to level the Highlanders, and procure a farther vent for our own product, which is already so much relished, encouraged, and rewarded, by the Nobi∣lity and Gentry of Great Britain.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="204"/>
Therefore to supply our former defect, I pur∣pose to collect the scattered Rules of our Art into regular Institutes, from the example and practice of the deep Genius's of our nation; imitating here∣in my predecessors the Master of Alexander, and the Secretary of the renowned Zenobia. And in this my undertaking I am the more animated, as I expect more success than has attended even those great Critics; since their Laws (tho' they might be good) have ever been slackly executed, and their Precepts (however strict) obey'd only by fits, and by a very small number.</P>
<P>At the same time I intend to do justice upon our neighbours, inhabitants of the upper Parnas∣sus; who, taking advantage of the rising ground, are perpetually throwing down rubbish, dirt and stones upon us, never suffering us to live in peace. These men, while they enjoy the crystal stream of Helicon, envy us our common water, which (thank our stars) tho' it is somewhat muddy, flows in much greater abundance. Nor is this the greatest injustice that we have to complain of; for though it is evident that we never made the least attempt or inrode into Their territories, but lived contented in our native fens; they have often not only committed Petty Larcenies upon our borders, but driven the country, and carried off at once whole Cart-loads of our manufacture; to reclaim some of which stolen goods is part of the design of this Treatise.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="205"/>
For we shall see in the course of this work, that our greatest Adversaries have sometimes descend∣ed towards us; and doubtless might now and then have arrived at the Bathos itself, had it not been for that mistaken opinion they all entertained, that the Rules of the Ancients were equally necessary to the Moderns; than which there cannot be a more grievous Error, as will be amply proved in the fol∣lowing discourse.</P>
<P>And indeed when any of these have gone so far, as by the light of their own Genius to attempt <HI>new</HI> Models, it is wonderful to observe, how nearly they have approached us in those particular pieces; though in their others they differ'd <HI>toto caelo</HI> from us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That the Bathos, or Profund, is the na∣tural Taste of Man, and in particular, of the present Age.</HEAD>
<P>THE Taste of the Bathos is implanted by Nature itself in the soul of man; till, per∣verted by custom or example, he is taught, or ra∣ther compelled, to relish the Sublime. Accord∣ingly, we see the unprejudiced minds of Children delight only in such productions, and in such
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>
images, as our true modern writers set before them. I have observed how fast the general Taste is re∣turning to this first Simplicity and Innocence: and if the intent of all Poetry be to divert and instruct, certainly that kind which diverts and instructs the <HI>greatest number,</HI> is to be preferred. Let us look round among the Admirers of Poetry, we shall find those who have a taste of the Sublime to be very few; but the Profund strikes universally, and is adapted to every capacity. 'Tis a fruitless undertaking to write for men of a nice and foppish Gusto, whom after all it is almost impossible to please; and 'tis still more chimerical to write for Posterity, of whose Taste we cannot make any judgment, and whose Applause we can never en∣joy. It must be confessed our wiser authors have a present end,
<Q><L>Et prodesse volunt et delectare Poetae.</L></Q>
Their true design is Profit or Gain; in order to acquire which, 'tis necessary to procure applause by administring pleasure to the reader: From whence it follows demonstrably, that their pro∣ductions must be suited to the <HI>present</HI> Taste. And I cannot but congratulate our age on this peculiar felicity, that though we have made indeed great progress in all other branches of Luxury, we are not yet debauched with any high Relish in Poe∣try, but are in this one Taste less nice than our ancestors. If an Art is to be estimated by its suc∣cess,
<PB N="202" REF="207"/>
I appeal to experience whether there have not been, in proportion to their number, as many starving good Poets, as bad ones.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, in making Gain the principal end of our Art, far be it from me to exclude any great Genius's of <HI>Rank</HI> or <HI>Fortune</HI> from diverting them∣selves this way. They ought to be praised no less than those Princes, who pass their vacant hours in some ingenious mechanical or manual Art. And to such as these, it would be ingratitude not to own, that our Art has been often infinitely in∣debted.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Necessity of the Bathos, physically considered.</HEAD>
<P>FArthermore, it were great cruelty and injus∣tice, if all such Authors as cannot write in the other way, were prohibited from writing at all. Against this I draw an argument from what seems to me an undoubted physical Maxim, That Poe∣try is a natural or morbid Secretion from the Brain. As I would not suddenly stop a cold in the head, or dry up my neighbour's Issue, I would as little hinder him from necessary writing. It may be af∣firmed with great truth, that there is hardly any
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
human creature past childhood, but at one time or other has had some Poetical Evacuation, and, no question, was much the better for it in his health; so true is the saying, <HI>Nascimur Poetae.</HI> Therefore is the Desire of Writing properly term'd <HI>Pruritus,</HI> the <Q>“Titillation of the Generative Faculty of the Brain,”</Q> and the Person is said to conceive; now such as conceive must bring forth. I have known a man thoughtful, melancholy and raving for di∣vers days, who forthwith grew wonderfully easy, lightsome, and cheerful, upon a discharge of the peccant humour, in exceeding purulent Metre. Nor can I question, but abundance of untimely deaths are occasioned for want of this laudable vent of unruly passions: yea, perhaps, in poor wretches, (which is very lamentable) for mere want of pen, ink, and paper! From hence it follows, that a suppression of the very worst Poetry is of dangerous consequence to the State. We find by experience, that the same humours which vent themselves in summer in Ballads and Sonnets, are condensed by the winter's cold into Pamphlets and Speeches for and against the Ministry: Nay, I know not but many times a piece of Poetry may be the most in∣nocent composition of a Minister himself.</P>
<P>It is therefore manifest that <HI>Mediocrity</HI> ought to be allowed, yea indulged, to the good Subjects of England. Nor can I conceive how the world has swallowed the contrary as a Maxim, upon the sin∣gle
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
authority of that <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Mediocribus esse poetis</L>
<L>Non dii, non homines, etc. <BIBL>Hor. P.</BIBL></L></Q></NOTE>Horace? Why should the golden Mean, and quintessence of all Virtues, be deemed so offensive in this Art? or Coolness or Mediocrity be so amiable a quality in a Man, and so detestable in a Poet?</P>
<P>However, far be it from me to compare these Writers with those great Spirits, who are born with a <HI>Vivacité de pesanteur,</HI> or (as an English Author calls it) an "Alacrity of sinking;" and who by strength of Nature alone can excel. All I mean is to evince the Necessity of Rules to these lesser Genius's, as well as the Usefulness of them to the greater.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That there is an Art of the Bathos, or Profund.</HEAD>
<P>WE come now to prove, that there is an Art of Sinking in Poetry. Is there not an Architecture of Vaults and Cellars, as well as of lofty Domes and Pyramids? Is there not as much skill and labour in making Dikes, as in rai∣sing Mounts? Is there not an Art of Diving as well as of Flying? And will any sober practitioner affirm, that a diving Engine is not of singular use in making him long-winded, assisting his sight,
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
and furnishing him with other ingenious means of keeping under water?</P>
<P>If we search the Authors of Antiquity, we shall find as few to have been distinguished in the true Profund, as in the true Sublime. And the very same thing (as it appears from Longinus) had been imagined of that, as now of this: namely, that it was entirely the Gift of Nature. I grant that to excel in the Bathos a Genius is requisite; yet the Rules of Art must be allowed so far use∣ful, as to add weight, or, as I may say, hang on lead, to facilitate and enforce our descent, to guide us to the most advantageous declivities, and habi∣tuate our imagination to a depth of thinking. Many there are that can fall, but few can arrive at the felicity of falling gracefully; much more for a man who is amongst the lowest of the Creation, at the very bottom of the Atmosphere, to descend beneath himself, is not so easy a task unless he calls in Art to his assistance. It is with the Bathos as with small Beer, which is indeed vapid and insi∣pid, if left at large, and let abroad; but being by our Rules confined and well stopt, nothing grows so frothy, pert, and bouncing.</P>
<P>The Sublime of Nature is the Sky, the Sun, Moon, Stars, etc. The Profund of Nature is Gold, Pearls, precious Stones, and the Treasures of the Deep, which are inestimable as unknown. But all that lies between these, as Corn, Flower, Fruits, Animals, and Things for the meer use of
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
Man, are of mean price, and so common as not to be greatly esteemed by the curious. It being certain that any thing, of which we know the true use, cannot be invaluable: Which affords a solu∣tion, why common Sense hath either been totally despised, or held in small repute, by the greatest modern Critics and Authors.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the true Genius for the Profund, and by what it is constituted.</HEAD>
<P>AND I will venture to lay it down, as the first Maxim and Corner-Stone of this our Art; that whoever would excel therein, must stu∣diously avoid, detest, and turn his head from all the ideas, ways, and workings of that pestilent Foe to Wit, and Destroyer of fine Figures, which is known by the Name of <HI>Common Sense.</HI> His busi∣ness must be to contract the true <HI>Gout de travers;</HI> and to acquire a most happy, uncommon, unac∣countable Way of Thinking.</P>
<P>He is to consider himself as a Grotesque painter, whose works would be spoiled by an imitation of nature, or uniformity of design. He is to mingle bits of the most various, or discordant kinds, land∣scape, history, portraits, animals, and connect
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
them with a great deal of flourishing, by heads or tails, as it shall please his imagination, and con∣tribute to his principal end, which is to glare by strong oppositions of colours, and surprize by con∣trariety of images.</P>
<Q><L>Serpentes avibus geminentur, tigribus agni. <BIBL>Hor.</BIBL></L></Q>
<P>His design ought to be like a labyrinth, out of which no body can get clear but himself. And since the great Art of all Poetry is to mix Truth with Fiction, in order to join the <HI>Credible</HI> with the <HI>Surprizing;</HI> our author shall produce the Cre∣dible, by painting nature in her lowest simplicity; and the Surprizing, by contradicting common opi∣nion. In the very Manners he will affect the <HI>Marvellous;</HI> he will draw Achilles with the pati∣ence of Job; a Prince talking like a Jack-pud∣ding; a Maid of honour selling bargains; a foot∣man speaking like a philosopher; and a fine gen∣tleman like a scholar. Whoever is conversant in modern Plays, may make a most noble collection of this kind, and, at the same time, form a com∣plete body of <HI>modern Ethics and Morality.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing seemed more plain to our great au∣thors, than that the world had long been weary of <HI>natural things.</HI> How much the contrary are form∣ed to please, is evident from the universal applause daily given to the admirable entertainments of Harlequins and Magicians on our stage. When an audience behold a coach turned into a wheel∣barrow,
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
a conjurer into an old woman, or a man's head where his heels should be; how are they struck with transport and delight? Which can on∣ly be imputed to this cause, that each object is changed into that which hath been suggested to them by their own low ideas before.</P>
<P>He ought therefore to render himself master of this happy and <HI>anti-natural</HI> way of thinking to such a degree, as to be able, on the appearance of any object, to furnish his imagination with ideas infinitely <HI>below</HI> it. And his eyes should be like unto the wrong end of a perspective glass, by which all the objects of nature are lessened.</P>
<P>For Example; when a true genius looks upon the Sky, he immediately catches the idea of a piece of blue lutestring, or a child's mantle.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the several Kinds of Genius's in the Profund, and the Marks and Charac∣ters of each.</HEAD>
<P>I Doubt not but the reader, by this Cloud of ex∣amples, begins to be convinced of the truth of our assertion, that the Bathos is an <HI>Art;</HI> and that the Genius of no mortal whatever, following the mere ideas of Nature, and unassisted with an habitual, nay laborious peculiarity of thinking, could arrive at images so wonderfully low and un∣accountable. The great author, from whose trea∣sury we have drawn all these instances (the Fa∣ther of the Bathos, and indeed the Homer of it) has, like that immortal Greek, confined his labours to the greater Poetry, and thereby left room for
<PB N="213" REF="218"/>
others to acquire a due share of praise in inferior kinds. Many painters who could never hit a nose or an eye, have with felicity copied a small-pox, or been admirable at a toad or a red herring. And seldom are we without genius's for <HI>Still-life,</HI> which they can work up and stiffen with incredible ac∣curacy.</P>
<P>An universal Genius rises not in an age; but when he rises, armies rise in him! he pours forth five or six Epic Poems with greater facility, than five or six pages can be produced by an elaborate and servile copier after Nature or the Ancients. It is affirmed by Quintilian, that the same genius which made Germanicus so great a General, would with equal application have made him an excellent Heroic Poet. In like manner, reasoning from the affinity there appears between Arts and Sciences, I doubt not but an active catcher of butterflies, a careful and fanciful pattern-drawer, an industrious collector of shells, a laborious and tuneful bag∣piper, or a diligent breeder of tame rabbits, might severally excel in their respective parts of the Ba∣thos.</P>
<P>I shall range these confined and less copious Ge∣nius's under proper classes, and (the better to give their pictures to the reader) under the names of <HI>Animals</HI> of some sort or other; whereby he will be enabled, at the first sight of such as shall daily come forth, to know to what kind to refer, and with what Authors to compare them.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Profund, when it consists in the Thought.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already laid down the Principles upon which our author is to proceed, and the manner of forming his Thought by familiariz∣ing
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
his mind to the lowest objects; to which it may be added, that Vulgar Conversation will great∣ly contribute. There is no question but the Gar∣ret or the Printer's boy may often be discerned in the compositions made in such scenes and com∣pany; and much of Mr. Curl himself has been in∣sensibly infused into the works of his learned writers.</P>
<P>The Physician, by the study and inspection of urine and ordure, approves himself in the science; and in like sort should our author accustom and ex∣ercise his imagination upon the dregs of nature.</P>
<P>This will render his thoughts truly and funda∣mentally low, and carry him many fathoms be∣yond Mediocrity. For, certain it is (tho' some lukewarm heads imagine they may be safe by tem∣porizing between the extremes) that where there is not a Triticalness or Mediocrity in the Thought, it can never be sunk into the genuine and perfect Bathos, by the most elaborate low Expression: It can, at most, be only carefully obscured, or me∣taphorically debased. But 'tis the Thought alone that strikes, and gives the whole that spirit, which we admire and stare at. For instance, in that inge∣nious piece on a lady's drinking the Bath-waters:</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Anon.</NOTE> She drinks! She drinks! Behold the matchless dame!</L>
<L>To her 'tis water, but to us 'tis flame:</L>
<L><PB N="217" REF="222"/>
Thus fire is water, water fire by turns,</L>
<L>And the same stream at once both cools and burns.</L>
</LG>
<P>What can be more easy and unaffected than the Diction of these verses? 'Tis the Turn of Thought alone, and the Variety of Imagination, that charm and surprize us. And when the same lady goes into the Bath, the Thought (as in justness it ought) goes still deeper.</P>
<Q><L>"Venus beheld her, 'midst her croud of slaves,</L>
<L>And thought herself just risen from the waves.</L></Q>
<P>How much out of the way of common sense is this reflection of Venus, not knowing herself from the lady?</P>
<P>Of the same nature is that noble mistake of a frighted stag in a full chace, who (saith the Poet)
<Q><L>Hears his own feet, and thinks they sound like more;</L>
<L>And fears the hind feet will o'ertake the fore.</L></Q></P>
<P>So astonishing as these are, they yield to the fol∣lowing, which is Profundity itself,
<Q><L><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Theobald, Double Falshood.</NOTE> None but Himself can be his Parallel.</L></Q>
Unless it may seem borrowed from the Thought of that Master of a Show in Smithfield, who writ in large letters, over the picture of his elephant,
<Q><L>This is the greatest Elephant in the world, except Himself. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><SUP>y</SUP> Idem.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="223"/>
However our next instance is certainly an ori∣ginal: Speaking of a beautiful infant,</P>
<LG>
<L>So fair thou art, that if great Cupid be</L>
<L>A child, as Poets say, sure thou art he.</L>
<L>Fair Venus would mistake thee for her own,</L>
<L>Did not thy eyes proclaim thee not her son.</L>
<L>There all the lightnings of thy Mother's shine,</L>
<L>And with a fatal brightness kill in thine.</L>
</LG>
<P>First he is Cupid, then he is not Cupid; first Venus would mistake him, then she would not mi∣stake him; next his Eyes are his Mother's, and lastly they are not his Mother's, but his own.</P>
<P>Another author, describing a Poet that shines forth amidst a circle of Critics,
<Q><L>Thus Phoebus thro' the Zodiac takes his way,</L>
<L>And amid Monsters rises into day.</L></Q></P>
<P>What a peculiarity is here of invention? The Author's pencil, like the wand of Circe, turns all into monsters at a stroke. A great Genius takes things in the lump, without stopping at minute considerations: In vain might the ram, the bull, the goat, the lion, the crab, the scorpion, the fishes, all stand in his way, as mere natural ani∣mals: much more might it be pleaded that a pair of scales, an old man, and two innocent children, were no monsters: There were only the Centaur and the Maid that could be esteemed out of na∣ture. But what of that? with a boldness peculiar
<PB N="219" REF="224"/>
to these daring genius's, what he found not mon∣sters, he made so.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Profund, consisting in the Cir∣cumstances, and of Amplification and Periphrase in general.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT in a great measure distinguishes other writers from ours, is their chusing and separating such circumstances in a description as ennoble or elevate the subject.</P>
<P>The circumstances which are most natural are <HI>obvious,</HI> therefore not <HI>astonishing</HI> or peculiar. But those that are far-fetched, or unexpected, or hardly compatible, will surprise prodigiously. These therefore we must principally hunt out; but above all, preserve a laudable <HI>Prolixity;</HI> pre∣senting the whole and every side at once of the image to view. For Choice and Distinction are not only a curb to the spirit, and limit the descri∣ptive faculty, but also lessen the book; which is frequently of the worst consequence of all to our author.</P>
<P>When Job says in short, <Q>“He washed his feet in butter,”</Q> (a circumstance some Poets would
<PB N="220" REF="225"/>
have softened, or past over) now hear how this butter is spread out by the great Genius.</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Blackm. Job, p. 133.</NOTE> With teats distended with their milky store,</L>
<L>Such num'rous lowing herds, before my door,</L>
<L>Their painful burden to unload did meet,</L>
<L>That we with butter might have wash'd our feet.</L>
</LG>
<P>How cautious! and particular! He had (says our author) so many herds, which herds thriv'd so well, and thriving so well gave so much milk, and that milk produced so much butter, that, if he did not, he might have wash'd his feet in it.</P>
<P>The ensuing description of Hell is no less re∣markable in the circumstances.</P>

Who would not think the Poet had past his whole life at Wakes in such laudable diversions? since he teaches us how to hold, nay how to make a Cudgel!</P>
<P><HI>Periphrase</HI> is another great aid to <HI>Prolixity;</HI> be∣ing a diffused circumlocutory manner of expressing a known idea, which should be so mysteriously couch'd, as to give the reader the pleasure of guess∣ing what it is that the author can possibly mean, and a strange surprize when he finds it.</P>

Who would think, this was only a poor gentle-woman that sung finely?</P>
<P>We may define <HI>Amplification</HI> to be making the most of a Thought; it is the Spinning-wheel of the Bathos, which draws out and spreads it in the finest thread. There are Amplifiers who can ex∣tend half a dozen thin thoughts over a whole Fo∣lio; but for which, the tale of many a vast Ro∣mance, and the substance of many a fair volume might be reduced into the size of a primmer.</P>
<P>In the book of Job are these words, <Q>“Hast thou commanded the morning, and caused the day-spring to know his place?”</Q> How is this ex∣tended by the most celebrated Amplifier of our age?</P>

<P><PB N="223" REF="228"/>
You here see the hills not only trembling, but shaking off the woods from their backs, to run the faster: After this you are presented with a foot-race of mountains and woods, where the woods distance the mountains, that, like corpulent pursy fellows, come puffing and panting a vast way behind them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Imitation, and the Manner of Imitating.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the true authors of the Profund are to imitate diligently the examples in their <HI>own way,</HI> is not to be questioned, and that divers have by this means attained to a depth whereunto their own weight could never have carried them, is evident by sundry instances. Who sees not that De Foe was the poetical son of Withers, Tate of Ogilby, E. Ward of John Taylor, and E—n of Blackmore? Therefore when we sit down to write, let us bring some great author to our mind, and ask ourselves this question; How would Sir Richard have said this? Do I express myself as simply as Amb. Philips? Or flow my numbers with the quiet thoughtlessness of Mr. Welsted?</P>
<P>But it may seem somewhat strange to assert, that our Proficient should also read the works of those famous Poets who have excelled in the <HI>Sub∣lime:</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
Yet is not this a paradox? As Virgil is said to have read Ennius, out of his dunghill to draw gold, so may our author read Shakespear, Milton, and Dryden for the contrary end, to bury their gold in his own dunghil. A true Genius, when he finds any thing lofty or shining in them, will have the skill to bring it down, take off the gloss, or quite discharge the colour, by some ingenious Circumstance or Periphrase, some addition or di∣minution, or by some of those Figures, the use of which we shall shew in our next chapter.</P>
<P>The book of Job is acknowledged to be infi∣nitely sublime, and yet has not the father of the Bathos reduced it in every page? Is there a pas∣sage in all Virgil more painted up and laboured than the description of Aetna in the third Aeneid?</P>
<LG>
<L>Horrificis juxta tonat Aetna ruinis,</L>
<L>Interdumque atram prorumpit ad aethera nubem,</L>
<L>Turbine fumantem piceo, et candente favilla,</L>
<L>Attollitque globos flammarum, et sidera lambit.</L>
<L>Interdum scopulos avulsaque viscera montis</L>
<L>Erigit eructans, liquefactaque saxa sub auras</L>
<L>Cum gemitu glomerat, fundoque exaestuat imo.</L>
</LG>
<P>(I beg pardon of the gentle English reader, and such of our writers as understand not Latin.) Lo! how this is taken down by our British Poet, by the single happy thought of throwing the mountain into a <HI>fit</HI> of the <HI>colic.</HI></P>
<LG>
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
<L><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Pr. Arthur, p. 75.</NOTE> Aetna, and all the burning mountains, find</L>
<L>Their kindled stores with inbred storms of wind</L>
<L>Blown up to rage; and, <HI>roaring out,</HI> complain,</L>
<L>As torn with inward <HI>gripes,</HI> and tort'ring pain:</L>
<L>Lab'ring, they cast their <HI>dreadful vomit</HI> round,</L>
<L>And with their <HI>melted bowels</HI> spread the ground.</L>
</LG>
<P>Horace, in search of the Sublime, struck his head against the Stars <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.</NOTE>; but Empedocles, to fa∣thom the Profund, threw himself into Aetna. And who but would imagine our excellent Modern had also been there, from this description?</P>
<P><HI>Imitation</HI> is of two sorts; the first is when we force to our own purposes the Thoughts of others; the second consists in copying the Imperfections, or Blemishes of celebrated authors. I have seen a Play professedly writ in the style of Shakespear; wherein the resemblance lay in one single line,
<Q><L>And so gòod morrow t'ye, good master Lieutenant.</L></Q>
And sundry poems in imitation of Milton, where with the utmost exactness, and not so much as one exception, nevertheless was constantly <HI>nathless,</HI> em∣broider'd was <HI>broider'd,</HI> hermits were <HI>eremites,</HI> dis∣dain'd was <HI>'sdeign'd,</HI> shady <HI>umbrageous,</HI> enterprize <HI>emprize,</HI> pagan <HI>paynim,</HI> pinions <HI>pennons,</HI> sweet <HI>dul∣cet,</HI> orchards <HI>orchats,</HI> bridge-work <HI>pontifical;</HI> nay, her was <HI>hir,</HI> and their was <HI>thir</HI> thro' the whole poem. And in very deed, there is no other way by which the true modern poet could read, to any
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
purpose, the works of such men as Milton and Shakespear.</P>
<P>It may be expected, that, like other Critics, I should next speak of the <HI>Passions:</HI> But as the main end and principal effect of the Bathos is to produce <HI>Tranquillity of Mind,</HI> (and sure it is a better design to promote <HI>sleep</HI> than madness) we have little to say on this subject. Nor will the short bounds of this discourse allow us to treat at large of the <HI>Emol∣lients</HI> and <HI>Opiats</HI> of Poesy, of the Cool, and the manner of producing it, or of the methods used by our authors in managing the Passions. I shall but transiently remark, that nothing contributes so much to the <HI>Cool,</HI> as the use of <HI>Wit</HI> in expressing passion: The true genius rarely fails of points, conceits, and proper <HI>similes</HI> on such occasions: This we may term the <HI>Pathetic epigrammatical,</HI> in which even puns are made use of with good suc∣cess. Hereby our best authors have avoided throw∣ing themselves or their readers into any indecent Transports.</P>
<P>But as it is sometimes needful to excite the <HI>pas∣sions</HI> of our antagonist in the polemic way, the true students in the law have constantly taken their me∣thods from low life, where they observed, that, to move Anger, use is made of scolding and railing; to move Love, of bawdry; to beget Favour and Friendship, of gross flattery; and to produce Fear, of calumniating an adversary with crimes obnox∣ious to the State. As for Shame, it is a silly pas∣sion,
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
of which as our authors are incapable them∣selves, so they would not produce it in others.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Tropes and Figures: And first of the variegating, confounding, and reversing Figures.</HEAD>
<P>BUT we proceed to the <HI>Figures.</HI> We can∣not too earnestly recommend to our authors the study of the <HI>Abuse of Speech.</HI> They ought to lay it down as a principle, to say nothing in the usual way, but (if possible) in the direct contrary. Therefore the Figures must be so turn'd, as to manifest that intricate and wonderful Cast of Head which distinguishes all writers of this kind; or (as I may say) to refer exactly the Mold in which they were formed, in all its inequalities, cavities, obliquities, odd crannies, and distortions.</P>
<P>It would be endless, nay impossible to enume∣rate all such Figures; but we shall content our∣selves to range the principal, which most power∣fully contribute to the Bathos, under three Classes.</P>
<P>I. The Variegating, Confounding, or Revers∣ing Tropes and Figures.</P>
<P>II. The Magnifying, and</P>
<P>III. The Diminishing.</P>

We cannot avoid giving to these the Greek or Roman Names; but in tenderness to our country∣men and fellow-writers, many of whom, how∣ever exquisite, are wholly ignorant of those lan∣guages, we have also explained them in our mother tongue.</P>

<P>A Genuine Writer of the Profund will take care never to <HI>magnify</HI> any object without <HI>clouding</HI> it at the same time: His Thought will appear in a true mist, and very unlike what is in nature. It must always be remembered that Dark∣ness

<P>At other times this figure operates in a larger extent; and when the gentle reader is in expecta∣tion of some great image, he either finds it surpri∣zingly imperfect, or is presented with something low, or quite ridiculous. A surprize resembling that of a curious person in a cabinet of Antique Statues, who beholds on the pedestal the names of Homer, or Cato; but looking up, finds Homer without a head, and nothing to be seen of Cato but his privy member.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Expression, and the several Sorts of Style of the present Age.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Expression</HI> is adequate, when it is pro∣portionably low to the Profundity of the Thought. It must not be always <HI>Grammatical,</HI> lest it appear pedantic and ungentlemanly; nor too clear, for fear it becomes vulgar; for obscurity bestows a cast of the wonderful, and throws an oracular dignity upon a piece which hath no meaning.</P>
<P>For example, sometimes use the wrong Num∣ber; <HI>The Sword and Pestilence at once devours,</HI> in∣stead of <HI>devour.</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ti. Hom. Il. i.</NOTE>Sometimes the wrong Case;

And who more fit to sooth the God than thee? <HI>instead of</HI> thou: <HI>And rather than say,</HI> Thetis saw Achilles weep, <HI>she</HI> heard <HI>him weep.</HI></P>
<P>We must be exceeding careful in two things; first, in the <HI>Choice</HI> of <HI>low Words:</HI> secondly, in the <HI>sober</HI> and <HI>orderly</HI> way of <HI>ranging</HI> them. Many of our Poets are naturally bless'd with this talent, in∣somuch that they are in the circumstance of that honest Citizen, who had made <HI>Prose</HI> all his life without knowing it. Let verses run in this man∣ner, just to be a vehicle to the words: (I take them from my last cited author, who, tho' other∣wise by no means of our rank, seemed once in his life to have a mind to be simple.)</P>

<P>It is also useful to employ <HI>Technical Terms,</HI> which estrange your style from the great and general ideas of nature: and the higher your subject is, the lower should you search into mechanicks for your expression. If you describe the garment of an an∣gel,

<P>STYLE is divided by the Rhetoricians into the Proper and the Figured. Of the Figured we have already treated, and the Proper is what our au∣thors have nothing to do with. Of Styles we shall mention only the Principal which owe to the mo∣derns either their chief Improvement, or entire Invention.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>1. The FLORID Style,</HEAD>
<P>than which none is more proper to the Bathos, as flowers, which are the <HI>Lowest</HI> of vegetables, are most <HI>Gaudy,</HI> and do many times grow in great plenty at the bottom of <HI>Ponds</HI> and <HI>Ditches.</HI></P>
<P>A fine writer in this kind presents you with the following Posie:</P>
<LG>
<L><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Behn's Poems, p. 2.</NOTE> The groves appear all drest with wreaths of flowers,</L>
<L>And from their leaves drop aromatic showers,</L>
<L>Whose fragrant heads in mystic twines above,</L>

<L><PB N="245" REF="250"/>

<L>On all th' angelic gazing throng below.</L>
</LG>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>2. The PERT Style.</HEAD>
<P>This does in as peculiar a manner become the low in wit, as a pert air does the low in stature. Mr. <HI>Thomas Brown,</HI> the author of the <HI>London Spy,</HI> and all the <HI>Spies</HI> and <HI>Trips</HI> in general, are herein to be diligently studied: In Verse Mr. <HI>Cibber's Prologues.</HI></P>
<P>But the beauty and energy of it is never so con∣spicuous, as when it is employed in <HI>Modernizing</HI> and <HI>Adapting</HI> to the <HI>Taste of the Times</HI> the works
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
of the <HI>Antients.</HI> This we rightly phrase <HI>Doing</HI> them into English, and <HI>Making</HI> them English; two expressions of great Propriety, the one denot∣ing our <HI>Neglect</HI> of the <HI>Manner how,</HI> the other the <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Compulsion</HI> with which it is brought about. It is by virtue of this Style that Tacitus talks like a Coffee-House Politician, Josephus like the British Gazetteer, Tully is as short and smart as Seneca or Mr. Asgill, Marcus Aurelius is excel∣lent at Snipsnap, and honest Thomas à Kempis as Prim and Polite as any preacher at court.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>3. The ALAMODE Style,</HEAD>
<P>which is fine by being <HI>new,</HI> and has this happiness attending it, that it is as durable and extensive as the poem itself. Take some examples of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in the description of the Sun in a Mourning coach upon the death of Queen Mary.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Project for the Advancement of the Bathos.</HEAD>
<P>THUS have I (my dear Countrymen) with incredible pains and diligence, discovered the hidden sources of the <HI>Bathos,</HI> or, as I may say, broke open the Abysses of this <HI>Great Deep.</HI> And having now established good and wholesome Laws, what remains but that all true moderns with their utmost might do proceed to put the same in execution? In order whereto, I think I shall in the second place highly deserve of my Country, by proposing such a <HI>Scheme,</HI> as may fa∣cilitate this great end.</P>
<P>As our Number is confessedly far superior to that of the enemy, there seems nothing wanting but Unanimity among ourselves. It is therefore humbly offered, that all and every individual of the Bathos do enter into a firm association, and in∣corporate into One regular Body, whereof every member, even the meanest, will some way con∣tribute to the support of the whole; in like man∣ner, as the weakest reeds, when joined in one bun∣dle, become infrangible. To which end our Art ought to be put upon the same foot with other Arts of this age. The vast improvement of mo∣dern
<PB N="252" REF="257"/>
manufactures ariseth from their being divid∣ed into several branches, and parcelled out to se∣veral trades: For instance, in Clock-making one artist makes the balance, another the spring, ano∣ther the crown-wheels, a fourth the case, and the principal workman puts all together: To this oeco∣nomy we owe the perfection of our modern watches, and doubtless we also might that of our modern Poetry and Rhetoric, were the several parts branched out in the like manner.</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident than that divers per∣sons, no other way remarkable, have each a strong disposition to the formation of some particular Trope or Figure. Aristotle saith, that the <HI>Hyper∣bole</HI> is an ornament fit for young Men of Quality; accordingly we find in those Gentlemen a wonder∣ful propensity toward it, which is marvellously improved by Travelling: Soldiers also and Seamen are very happy in the same Figure. The <HI>Peri∣phrasis</HI> or <HI>Circumlocution</HI> is the peculiar talent of Country Farmers; the <HI>Proverb</HI> and <HI>Apologue</HI> of old Men at their clubs; the <HI>Ellipsis</HI> or Speech by half words, of Ministers and Politicians, the <HI>Apo∣siopesis</HI> of Courtiers, the <HI>Litotes</HI> or Diminution of Ladies, Whisperers and Backbiters, and the <HI>Ana∣diplosis</HI> of common Cryers and Hawkers, who, by redoubling the same words, persuade people to buy their oysters, green hastings, or new ballads. <HI>Epithets</HI> may be found in great plenty at Billins∣gate, <HI>Sarcasm</HI> and <HI>Irony</HI> learned upon the Water,
<PB N="253" REF="258"/>
and the <HI>Epiphonema</HI> or <HI>Exclamation</HI> frequently from the Beargarden, and as frequently from the <HI>Hear him</HI> of the House of Commons.</P>
<P>Now each man applying his whole time and genius upon his particular Figure, would doubtless attain to perfection; and when each became in∣corporated and sworn into the Society (as hath been proposed) a Poet or Orator would have no more to do but to send to the particular Traders in each Kind, to the <HI>Metaphorist</HI> for his <HI>Allegories,</HI> to the <HI>Simile-maker</HI> for his <HI>Comparisons,</HI> to the <HI>Iro∣nist</HI> for his <HI>Sarcasms,</HI> to the <HI>Apothegmatist</HI> for his <HI>Sentences,</HI> etc. whereby a Dedication or Speech would be composed in a moment, the superior ar∣tist having nothing to do but to put together all the Materials.</P>
<P>I therefore propose that there be contrived with all convenient dispatch, at the publick expence, a <HI>Rhetorical Chest of Drawers,</HI> consisting of three Stories, the highest for the <HI>Deliberative,</HI> the mid∣dle for the <HI>Demonstrative,</HI> and the lowest for the <HI>Judicial.</HI> These shall be divided into <HI>Loci,</HI> or <HI>Places,</HI> being repositories for Matter and Argu∣ment in the several kinds of oration or writing; and every Drawer shall again be sub-divided into Cells, resembling those of Cabinets for Rarities. The apartment for <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War,</HI> and that of the <HI>Liberty of the Press,</HI> may in a very few days be filled with several arguments perfectly new; and the <HI>Vituperative Partition</HI> will as easily be reple∣nished
<PB N="254" REF="259"/>
with a most choice collection, entirely of the growth and manufacture of the present age. Every composer will soon be taught the use of this Cabinet, and how to manage all the Registers of it, which will be drawn out much in the manner of those in an Organ.</P>
<P>The Keys of it must be kept in honest hands, by some <HI>Reverend Prelate,</HI> or <HI>Valiant Officer,</HI> of unquestioned Loyalty and Affection to every pre∣sent Establishment in Church and State; which will sufficiently guard against any mischief which might otherwise be apprehended from it.</P>
<P>And being lodged in such hands, it may be at discretion <HI>let out</HI> by the <HI>Day,</HI> to several great Ora∣tors in both Houses; from whence it is to be hoped much <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Gain</HI> will also accrue to our Society.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">How to make Dedications, Panegyrics, or Satires, and of the Colours of Honour∣able and Dishonourable.</HEAD>
<P>NOW of what nccessity the foregoing Pro∣ject may prove, will appear from this sin∣gle consideration, that nothing is of equal conse∣quence to the success of our Works, as <HI>Speed</HI> and
<PB N="255" REF="260"/>
<HI>Dispatch.</HI> Great pity it is, that solid brains are not like other solid bodies, constantly endowed with a velocity in sinking, proportioned to their heaviness: For it is with the Flowers of the Ba∣thos as with those of Nature, which if the careful gardener brings not hastily to market in the Morn∣ing, must unprofitably perish and wither before Night. And of all our Productions none is so short-lived as the <HI>Dedication</HI> and <HI>Panegyric,</HI> which are often but the <HI>Praise of a Day,</HI> and become by the next, utterly useless, improper, indecent, and false. This is the more to be lamented, in∣asmuch as these two are the sorts whereon in a manner depends that <HI>Profit,</HI> which must still be remembered to be the main end of our <HI>Writers</HI> and <HI>Speakers.</HI></P>
<P>We shall therefore employ this chapter in shew∣ing the quickest method of composing them; after which we will teach a <HI>short Way to Epic Poetry.</HI> And these being confessedly the works of most Importance and Difficulty, it is presumed we may leave the rest to each author's own learning or practice.</P>
<P>First of <HI>Panegyric:</HI> Every man is <HI>honourable,</HI> who is so by Law, Custom, or Title. The <HI>Pub∣lick</HI> are better judges of what is honourable than private Men. The Virtues of great Men, like those of Plants, are inherent in them whether they are exerted or not; and the more strongly inhe∣rent, the less they are exerted; as a Man is the
<PB N="256" REF="261"/>
more rich, the less he spends. All great Mini∣sters, without either private or oeconomical Virtue, are <HI>virtuous</HI> by their <HI>Posts;</HI> liberal and generous upon the <HI>Publick Money,</HI> provident upon <HI>Pub∣lick Supplies,</HI> just by paying <HI>Publick Interest,</HI> cou∣ragious and magnanimous by the <HI>Fleets</HI> and <HI>Ar∣mies,</HI> magnificent upon the <HI>Publick Expences,</HI> and prudent by <HI>Publick Success.</HI> They have by their Office, a right to a share of the <HI>Publick Stock</HI> of Virtues; besides they are by <HI>Prescription im∣memorial</HI> invested in all the celebrated virtues of their <HI>Predecessors</HI> in the same stations, especially those of their own Ancestors.</P>
<P>As to what are commonly called the <HI>Colours</HI> of <HI>Honourable</HI> and <HI>Dishonourable,</HI> they are various in different Countries: In this they are <HI>Blue, Green,</HI> and <HI>Red.</HI></P>
<P>But forasmuch as the duty we owe to the Pub∣lick doth often require that we should put some things in a strong light, and throw a shade over others, I shall explain the method of turning a vi∣cious Man into a Hero.</P>
<P>The first and chief rule is the <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of <HI>Transformation,</HI> which consi&amp;;sts in converting Vices into their bordering Virtues. A Man who is a Spendthrift, and will not pay a just Debt, may have his Injustice <HI>transformed</HI> into Liberality; Cowardice may be metamorphosed into Prudence; Intemperance into good Nature and good Fellow∣ship;
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
Corruption into Patriotism; and Lewdness into Tenderness and Facility.</P>
<P>The second is the <HI>Rule of Contraries:</HI> It is cer∣tain, the less a Man is endued with any Virtue, the more need he has to have it plentifully bestowed, especially those good qualities of which the world generally believes he hath none at all: For who will thank a Man for giving him that which he <HI>has?</HI></P>
<P>The Reverse of these Precepts will serve for <HI>Sa∣tire,</HI> wherein we are ever to remark, that whose loseth his place, or becomes out of favour with the Government, hath forfeited his share in <HI>publick Praise</HI> and <HI>Honour.</HI> Therefore the truly publick spirited writer ought in duty to strip him whom the government hath stripped; which is the real <HI>poetical Justice</HI> of this age. For a full collection of Topicks and Epithets to be used in the Praise and Dispraise of Ministerial and Unministerial Per∣sons, I refer to our <HI>Rhetorical Cabinet;</HI> conclud∣ing with an earnest exhortation to all my brethren, to observe the Precepts here laid down, the neg∣lect of which hath cost some of them their <HI>Ears</HI> in a <HI>Pillory.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Receipt to make an Epic Poem.</HEAD>
<P>AN Epic Poem, the Critics agree, is the greatest work human nature is capable of. They have already laid down many mechanical rules for compositions of this sort, but at the same time they cut off almost all undertakers from the possibility of ever performing them; for the first qualification they unanimously require in a Poet, is a <HI>Genius.</HI> I shall here endeavour (for the benefit of my Countrymen) to make it manifest, that Epic Poems may be made <HI>without a Genius,</HI> nay with∣out Learning or much Reading. This must ne∣cessarily be of great use to all those who confess they never <HI>Read,</HI> and of whom the world is con∣vinced they never <HI>Learn.</HI> Moliere observes of making a dinner, that any man can do it with <HI>Money,</HI> and if a professed Cook cannot do it with∣out, he has his Art for nothing; the same may be said of making a Poem, 'tis easily brought about by him that has a <HI>Genius,</HI> but the skill lies in do∣ing it without one. In pursuance of this end, I shall present the reader with a plain and certain <HI>Recipe,</HI> by which any author in the Bathos may be qualified for this grand performance.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="259" REF="264"/>
<HEAD>For the FABLE.</HEAD>
<P>Take out of any old Poem, History-book, Ro∣mance, or Legend (for instance, <HI>Geoffry of Mon∣mouth,</HI> or <HI>Don Belianis of Greece)</HI> those parts of story which afford most scope for <HI>long Descrip∣tions:</HI> Put these pieces together, and throw all the adventures you fancy into <HI>one Tale.</HI> Then take a Hero, whom you may chuse for the sound of his name, and put him into the midst of these adven∣tures: There let him <HI>work</HI> for twelve books; at the end of which you may take him out, ready prepared to <HI>conquer</HI> or to <HI>marry;</HI> it being neces∣sary that the conclusion of an Epic Poem be <HI>for∣tunate.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>To make an EPISODE.</HEAD>
<P>Take any remaining adventure of your former collection, in which you could no way involve your Hero; or any unfortunate accident that was too good to be thrown away; and it will be of use, applied to any other person, who may be lost and <HI>evaporate</HI> in the course of the work, without the least damage to the composition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For the MORAL and ALLEGORY.</HEAD>
<P>These you may extract out of the Fable after∣wards, at your leisure: Be sure you <HI>strain</HI> them sufficiently.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="260" REF="265"/>
<HEAD>For the MANNERS.</HEAD>
<P>For those of the Hero, take all the best quali∣lities you can find in the most celebrated Heroes of antiquity; if they will not be reduced to a <HI>Con∣sistency,</HI> lay them <HI>all on a heap</HI> upon him. But be sure they are qualities which your <HI>Patron</HI> would be thought to have; and to prevent any mistake which the world may be subject to, select from the al∣phabet those capital letters that compose his name, and set them at the head of a Dedication before your Poem. However, do not absolutely observe the exact quantity of these Virtues, it not being determined whether or no it be necessary for the Hero of a Poem to be an <HI>honest Man.</HI> For the <HI>Under-Characters,</HI> gather them from Homer and Virgil, and change the names as occasion serves.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For the MACHINES.</HEAD>
<P>Take of <HI>Deities,</HI> male and female, as many as you can use: Separate them into two equal parts, and keep Jupiter in the middle; Let Juno put him in a ferment, and Venus mollify him. Remem∣ber on all occasions to make use of volatile Mer∣cury. If you have need of <HI>Devils,</HI> draw them out of Milton's Paradise, and extract your <HI>Spirits</HI> from Tasso. The use of these Machines is evident; since no Epic Poem can possibly subsist without them, the wisest way is to reserve them for your greatest necessities: When you cannot extricate
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
your Hero by any human means, or yourself by your own wit, seek relief from Heaven, and the Gods will do your business very readily. This is according to the direct Prescription of Horace in his Art of Poetry,
<Q><L>Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice <HI>Nodus</HI></L>
<L>Inciderit.—</L></Q>
That is to say, <HI>A Poet should never call upon the Gods for their Assistance, but when he is in great Perplexity.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>For the DESCRIPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>For a <HI>Tempest.</HI> Take Eurus, Zephyr, Auster, and Boreas, and cast them together in one verse: add to these of Rain, Lightning and Thunder (the loudest you can) <HI>quantum sufficit:</HI> mix your Clouds and Billows well together 'till they foam, and thicken your Description here and there with a Quicksand. Brew your Tempest well in your head, before you set it a blowing.</P>
<P>For a <HI>Battle.</HI> Pick a large quantity of Images and Descriptions from Homer's Iliads, with a spice or two of Virgil, and if there remain any over∣plus, you may lay them by for a <HI>Skirmish.</HI> Sea∣son it well with <HI>Similes,</HI> and it will make an ex∣cellent Battle.</P>
<P>For a <HI>Burning Town.</HI> If such a Description be necessary (because it is certain there is one in
<PB N="262" REF="267"/>
Virgil) old Troy is ready burnt to your hands. But if you fear that would be thought borrowed, a Chapter or two of the Theory of the <HI>Conflagra∣tion,</HI> well circumstanced and done into verse, will be a good <HI>Succedaneum.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Similes</HI> and <HI>Metaphors,</HI> they may be found all over the Creation; the most ignorant may <HI>gather</HI> them, but the difficulty is in <HI>applying</HI> them. For this advise with your <HI>Bookseller.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Project for the Advancement of the Stage.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be thought that we should not wholly omit the <HI>Drama,</HI> which makes so great and so lucrative a part of Poetry. But this Province is so well taken care of, by the present <HI>Managers</HI> of the Theatre, that it is perfectly needless to suggest to them any other Methods than they have already practised for the advancement of the Bathos.</P>
<P>Here therefore, in the Name of all our Bre∣thren, let me return our sincere and humble Thanks to the most August Mr. Barton Booth, the most Serene Mr. Robert Wilks, and the most Undaunted Mr. Colly Cibber; of whom let it be
<PB N="263" REF="268"/>
known, <HI>when the People of this Age shall be Ances∣tors,</HI> and to all <HI>the Succession of our Successors,</HI> that to this present Day they continue to <HI>Out-do</HI> even their <HI>own Out-doings:</HI> And when the inevitable Hand of sweeping Time shall have brushed off all the Works of <HI>To-day,</HI> may this Testimony of a <HI>Co-temporary Critic</HI> to their Fame, be extended as far as <HI>To-morrow.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, if to so wise an Administration it be possi∣ble any thing can be added, it is that more ample and comprehensive Scheme which Mr. Dennis and Mr. Gildon (the two greatest Critics and Reform∣ers then living) made publick in the year 1720, in a Project signed with their Names, and dated the 2<SUP>d</SUP> of February. I cannot better conclude than by presenting the Reader with the Substance of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is proposed, That the two <HI>Theatres</HI> be in∣corporated into one Company; that the <HI>Royal Aca∣demy of Musick</HI> be added to them as an <HI>Orchestra;</HI> and that Mr. Figg with his Prize-fighters, and Violante with the Rope-dancers, be admitted in Partnership.</P>
<P N="2">2. That a spacious Building be erected at the Public expence, capable of containing at least <HI>ten thousand</HI> Spectators, which is become absolutely necessary by the great addition of Children and Nurses to the Audience, since the new Entertain∣ments. That there be a Stage as large as the Athe∣nian, which was near ninety thousand geometri∣cal
<PB N="264" REF="269"/>
paces square, and separate divisions for the two Houses of Parliament, my Lords the Judges, the honourable the Directors of the Academy, and the Court of Aldermen, who shall all have their Places frank.</P>
<P N="3">3. If <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> be not allotted to this ser∣vice (which by reason of its proximity to the two Chambers of Parliament above-mentioned, seems not altogether improper;) it is left to the wisdom of the Nation whether <HI>Somerset-House</HI> may not be demolished, and a Theatre built upon that Site, which lies convenient to receive Spectators from the County of <HI>Surrey,</HI> who may be wafted thither by water-carriage, esteemed by all Projectors the cheapest whatsoever. To this may be added, that the river <HI>Thames</HI> may in the readiest manner con∣vey those eminent Personages from Courts beyond the seas, who may be drawn either by Curiosity to behold some of our most celebrated Pieces, or by Affection to see their Countrymen, the Harle∣quins and Eunuchs; of which convenient notice may be given, for two or three months before, in the public Prints.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the <HI>Theatre</HI> abovesaid be environed with a fair Quadrangle of Buildings, fitted for the accommodation of decayed <HI>Critics</HI> and <HI>Poets;</HI> out of whom <HI>Six</HI> of the most aged (their age to be computed from the year wherein their first work was published) shall be elected to manage the af∣fairs
<PB N="265" REF="270"/>
of the society, provided nevertheless that the Laureat for the time being, may be always one. The Head or President over all (to prevent dis∣putes, but too frequent among the learned) shall be the most ancient <HI>Poet</HI> and <HI>Critic</HI> to be found in the whole Island.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Male-Players</HI> are to be lodged in the garrets of the said Quadrangle, and to attend the persons of the Poets, dwelling under them, by brushing their apparel, drawing on their shoes, and the like. The <HI>Actresses</HI> are to make their beds, and wash their linen.</P>
<P N="6">6. A large room shall be set apart for a <HI>Library</HI> to consist of all the modern Dramatick Poems, and all the Criticisms extant. In the midst of this room shall be a round table for the <HI>Council of Six</HI> to sit and deliberate on the Merits of <HI>Plays.</HI> The <HI>Majority</HI> shall determine the Dispute; and if it should happen that <HI>three</HI> and <HI>three</HI> should be of each side, the President shall have a <HI>casting Voice,</HI> unless where the Contention may run so high as to require a decision by <HI>Single Combat.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. It may be convenient to place the <HI>Counsel of Six</HI> in some conspicuous situation in the Theatre, where after the manner usually practised by compo∣sers in musick, they may give <HI>Signs</HI> (before settled and agreed upon) of Dislike or Approbation. In consequence of these Signs the whole audience
<PB N="266" REF="271"/>
shall be required to <HI>clap</HI> or <HI>hiss,</HI> that the Town may learn certainly when and how far they ought to be pleas'd?</P>
<P N="8">8. It is submitted whether it would not be pro∣per to distinguish the <HI>Council of Six</HI> by some par∣ticular Habit or Gown of an honourable shape and colour, to which may be added a square Cap and a white Wand.</P>
<P N="9">9. That to prevent unmarried Actresses making away with their Infants, a competent provision be allowed for the nurture of them, who shall for that reason be deemed the <HI>Children of the Society;</HI> and that they may be educated according to the Genius of their parents, the said Actresses shall declare upon Oath (as far as their memory will allow) the true names and qualities of their seve∣ral fathers. A private Gentleman's Son shall at the publick expence be brought up a Page to at∣tend the <HI>Council of Six:</HI> A more ample provision shall be made for the son of a <HI>Poet;</HI> and a greater still for the son of a <HI>Critic.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. If it be discovered that any Actress is got with Child, during the Interludes of any Play wherein she hath a Part, it shall be reckoned a neg∣lect of her business, and she shall <HI>forfeit</HI> according∣ly. If any Actor for the future shall commit Murder, except upon the stage, he shall be left to the laws of the land; the like is to be understood
<PB N="267" REF="272"/>
of <HI>Robbery</HI> and <HI>Theft.</HI> In all other cases, particu∣larly in those for <HI>Debt,</HI> it is proposed that this, like the other Courts of <HI>Whitehall</HI> and <HI>St. James</HI>'s, may be held a <HI>Place of Privilege.</HI> And whereas it has been found, that an obligation to satisfy paultry Creditors has been a Discouragement to Men of Letters, if any Person of Quality or others shall send for any <HI>Poet</HI> or <HI>Critic</HI> of this Society to any remote quarter of the town, the said Poet or Critic shall freely pass and repass without being li∣able to an <HI>Arrest.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. The forementioned Scheme in its several regulations may be supported by Profits arising from every Third-night throughout the year. And as it would be hard to suppose that so many per∣sons could live without any food (though from the former course of their lives, <HI>a very little</HI> will be deemed sufficient) the masters of calculation will, we believe, agree, that out of those Profits, the said persons might be subsisted in a sober and decent manner. We will venture to affirm fur∣ther, that not only the proper magazines of Thun∣der and Lightning, but <HI>Paint, Diet-drinks, Spit∣ting-pots,</HI> and all other <HI>Necessaries</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> may in like manner fairly be provided for.</P>
<P N="12">12. If some of the Articles may at first view seem liable to Objections, particularly those that give so vast a power to the <HI>Council of Six</HI> (which is indeed larger than any entrusted to the great
<PB N="268" REF="273"/>
Officers of state) this may be obviated, by swear∣ing those <HI>Six</HI> Persons of his Majesty's Privy Council, and obliging them to pass every thing of moment <HI>previously</HI> at that most honourable Board.</P>

I do bequeath unto the said <HI>Mat∣thew Stradling,</HI> Gent. <HI>all my black and white Horses.</HI>

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="282" REF="287"/>
The Cestator had six black Horses, six white Horses, and six pyed Horses.</P>
<P>The Debate therefore was, Whe∣ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">Le Point.</NOTE>or no the said Matthew Stradling should have the said pyed Horses by Vir∣tue of the said Bequest.</P>
<P>Atkins Apprentice pour le Pl. moy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pour le Pl.</NOTE>semble que le Pl. recovera.</P>
<P>And first of all it seemeth expedient to consider what is the Nature of Horses, and also what is the Nature of Colours; and so the Argument will consequently divide itself in a twofold way, that is to say, the Formal Part, and Substantial Part. Horses are the Substantial Part, or thing bequeath∣ed: Black and White the Formal or descriptive Part.</P>
<P>Horse, in a physical Sense, doth import a cer∣tain Quadrupede or four-footed Animal, which by the apt and regular Disposition of certain proper and convenient Parts, is adapted, fitted and constituted for the Use and Need of Man. Yea, so necessary and conducive was this Animal conceived to be to the Behoof of the Common-weal, that sundry and divers Acts of Parliament have from time to time been made in Favour of Horses.</P>
<P>Ist Edw. VI. Makes the Transporting of Horses out of the Kingdom, no less a Penalty than the Forfeiture of 40 l.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="288"/>
2d and 3d Edward VI. Takes from Horse∣stealers the Benefit of their Clergy.</P>
<P>And the Statutes of the 27th and 32d of Hen. VIII. condescend so far as to take Care of their very Breed: These our wise Ancestors prudently f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>secing, that they could not better take care of their own Hos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erity, than by also taking care of that of their Horses.</P>
<P>And of so great esteem are Horses in the Eye of the Common Law, that when a Knight of the Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h committeth any great and enormous Crime, his Punishment is to have his Spurs chop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off with a Cleaver, being, as Master Brac∣ton well observeth, unworthy to ride on a Horse.</P>
<P>Littleton, Sect. 315. saith, If Tenants in Com∣mon make a Lease reserving for Rent a Horse, they shall have but one Assize, because, saith the Book, the Law will not suffer a Horse to be se∣vered. Another Argument of what high Estima∣tion the Law maketh of an Horse.</P>
<P>But as the great difference seemeth not to be so much touching the substantial Part, Horses, let us proceed to the formal or descriptive Part, viz. What Horses they are that come within this Bequest.</P>
<P>Colours are commonly of various Kinds and different Sorts; of which White and Black are the
<PB N="284" REF="289"/>
two Extremes, and consequently comprehend within them all other Colours whatsoever.</P>
<P>By a Request therefore of black and white Horses, grey or pyed Horses may well pass; for when two Extremes, or remotest Ends, of any thing are devised, the Law, by common Intend∣ment, will intend whatsoever is contained between them to be devised too.</P>
<P>But the present Case is still stronger, coming not only within the Intendment, but also the very Letter of the Words.</P>
<P>By the Word Black, all the Horses that are black are devised; by the Word White, are de∣vised those that are White; and by the same Word, with the Conjunction Copulative, And, between them, the Horses that are Black and White, that is to say, Pyed, are devised also.</P>
<P>Whatever is Black and White is Pyed, and whatever is Pyed is Black and White; <HI>ergo,</HI> Black and White is Pyed, and, <HI>vice versa,</HI> Pyed is Black and White,</P>
<P>If therefore Black and White Horses are de∣vised, Pyed Horses shall pass by such Devise; but Black and White Horses are devised; <HI>ergo,</HI> the Pl. shall have the Pyed Horses.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pour le Defend.</NOTE> Catlyne Serjeant, May <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emble a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' contrary, The Plaintiff shall not have the Pyed Horses by Intendment; for if by
<PB N="285" REF="290"/>
the devise of Black and White Horses, not only black and white Horses, but Horses of any Co∣lour, between these two Extremes may pass, then not only Pyed and Grey Horses, but also Red or Bay Horses would pass likewise, which would be absurd, and against Reason. And this is ano∣ther strong Argument in Law, <HI>Nihil, quod est contra rationem, est licitum;</HI> for Reason is the Life of the Law, nay the common Law is nothing but Reason; which is to be understood of artificial Perfection and Reason gotten by long Study, and not of Man's natural Reason; for <HI>nemo nascitur ar∣tifex,</HI> and legal Reason <HI>est summa ratio;</HI> and there∣fore if all the Reason that is dispersed into so many different Heads, were united into one, he could not make such a Law as the Law of Eng∣land; because by many Successions of Ages it has been fired and refired by grave and learned Men; so that the old Rule may be verified in it, <HI>Neminem oportet esse legibus sapientiorem.</HI></P>
<P>As therefore pyed Horses do not come within the Intendment of the Beque<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, so neither do they within the Letter of the Words.</P>
<P>A pyed Horse is not a white Horse, neither is a pyed a black Horse; how then can pyed Horses come under the Words of black and white Horses?</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Original of the following extraordinary Treatise consisted of two large Volumes in Folio; which might justly be intitled, <HI>The Importance of a Man to himself:</HI> But, as it can be of very little to any body besides, I have contented myself to give only this short Abstract of it, as a Taste of the <HI>true Spirit of Memoir-Writers.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the name of the Lord. <HI>Amen.</HI> I, P. P. by the Grace of God, Clerk of this Parish, writeth this History.</P>
<P>Ever since I arrived at the age of discretion, I had a call to take upon me the function of a Pa∣rish-cletk; and to that end, it seemed unto me meet and profitable to associate myself with the parish-clerks of this Land; such I mean, as were right worthy in their calling, men of a clear and sweet voice, and of becoming gravity.</P>
<P>Now it came to pass, that I was born in the year of our Lord <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1655, the year wherein our worthy benefactor, Esquire <HI>Bret,</HI> did add one Bell to the ring of this Parish. So that
<PB N="288" REF="293"/>
it hath been wittily said, <Q>“”That one and the same day did give to this our Church two rare gifts, its great Bell and its Clerk.</Q></P>
<P>Even when I was at school, my mistress did ever extol me above the rest of the youth, in that I had a laudable voice. And it was further-more observed, that I took a kindly affection unto that Black letter in which our Bibles are printed. Yea, often did I exercise myself in singing godly bal∣lads, such as <HI>The Lady and Death, The Children in the Wood,</HI> and <HI>Chevy-Chace;</HI> and not, like other children, in lewd and trivial ditties. More∣over, while I was a boy, I always adventured to lead the psalm next after Master William Harris, my predecessor, who (it must be confessed to the Glory of God) was a most excellent Parish-clerk in that his day.</P>
<P>Yet be it acknowledged, that at the age of six∣teen I became a Company-keeper, being led into idle conversation by my extraordinary love to Ring∣ing; insomuch, that in a short time I was ac∣quainted with every sett of bells in the whole country: Neither could I be prevailed upon to absent myself from Wakes, being called thereunto by the harmony of the steeple. While I was in these societies, I gave myself up to unspiritual pastimes, such as wrestling, dancing, and cudgell∣playing; so that I often returned to my father's house with a broken pate. I had my head broken at Milton by Thomas Wyat, as we played a bout
<PB N="289" REF="294"/>
or two for an Hat that was edged with silver gal∣loon. But in the year following I broke the head of Henry Stubbs, and obtained an hat not inferior to the former. At Yelverton I encountred George Cummins, Weaver, and behold my head was broken a second time! At the wake of Waybrook I engaged William Simkins, Tanner, when lo! thus was my head broken a third time, and much blood trickled therefrom. But I administred to my comfort, saying within myself, <Q>“What man is there, howsoever dextrous in any craft, who is for aye on his guard?”</Q> A week after I had a base-born child laid unto me; for in the days of my youth I was looked upon as a follower of ve∣nereal fantasies: Thus was I led into sin by the comeliness of Susanna Smith, who first tempted me and then put me to shame; for indeed she was a maiden of a seducing eye, and pleasant feature. I humbled myself before the Justice, I acknowledg∣ed my crime to our Curate; and to do away mine offences and make her some attonement, was joined to her in holy wedlock on the sabbath day following.</P>
<P>How often do those things which seem unto us misfortunes, redound to our advantage! For the Minister (who had long look'd on Susanna as the most lovely of his parishioners) liked so well of my demeanour, that he recommended me to the honour of being his Clerk, which was then
<PB N="290" REF="295"/>
become vacant by the decease of good Master Wil∣liam Harris.</P>
<P>Here ends the first chapter; after which follow fifty or sixty pages of his amours in general, and that particular one with Susanna his present Wife; but I proceed to chapter the ninth.</P>
<P>No sooner was I elected into mine office, but I layed aside the powder'd gallantries of my youth, and became a new man. I considered myself as in some wise of ecclesiastical dignity, since by wear∣ing a band, which is no small part of the orna∣ment of our Clergy, I might not unworthily be deemed, as it were, a shred of the linen vestment of Aaron.</P>
<P>Thou may'st conceive, O reader, with what concern I perceived the eyes of the congregation fixed upon me, when I first took my place at the feet of the Priest. When I raised the psalm, how did my voice quaver for fear! And when I array'd the shoulders of the Minister with the surplice, how did my joints tremble under me! I said within myself, <Q>“Remember, Paul, thou standest before men of high worship, the wise Mr. Jus∣tice Freeman, the grave Mr. Justice Tonson, the good Lady Jones, and the two virtuous gen∣tlewomen her daughters, nay the great Sir Tho∣mas Truby, Knight and Baronet, and my young master the Esquire, who shall one day be Lord of this Manor:”</Q> Notwithstanding which, it was
<PB N="291" REF="296"/>
my good hap to acquit myself to the good liking of the whole congregation; but the Lord forbid I should glory therein.</P>
<P>The next chapter contains an account how he dis∣charged the several duties of his office; in particular be insists on the following:</P>
<P>I was determined to reform the manifold Cor∣ruptions and Abuses which had crept into the Church.</P>
<P>First, I was especially severe in whipping forth dogs from the Temple, all excepting the lap-dog of the good widow Howard, a sober dog which yelped not, nor was there offence in his mouth.</P>
<P>Secondly, I did even proceed to moroseness, tho' sore against my heart, unto poor babes, in tear∣ing from them the half-eaten apples which they privily munch'd at Church. But verily it pity'd me, for I remember'd the days of my youth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, With the sweat of my own hands, I did make plain and smooth the dogs-ears through∣out our great Bible.</P>
<P>Fourthly, The pews and benches which were formerly swept but once in three years, I caus'd every Saturday to be swept with a besom and trimmed.</P>
<P>Fifthly and lastly, I caused the surplice to be neatly darned, washed, and laid in fresh lavender, (yea, and sometimes to be sprinkled with rose∣water) and I had great laud and praise from all
<PB N="292" REF="297"/>
the neighbouring Clergy, forasmuch as no parish kept the Minister in cleaner linen.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these his publick cares, in the eleventh chapter he informs us he did not neglect his usual occupations as a handy-craftsman.</P>
<P>Shoes, saith he, did I make, (and, if intreated, mend) with good approbation. Faces also did I shave, and I clipped the hair. Chirurgery also I practised in the worming of Dogs; but to bleed adventured I not, except the poor. Upon this my twofold profession, there passed among men a mer∣ry tale delectable enough to be rehearsed: How that being overtaken with liquor one Saturday evening, I shav'd the Priest with Spanish blacking for shoes instead of a washball, and with lamp∣black powdered his perriwig. But these were say∣ings of men, delighting in their own conceits more than in the truth. For it is well known, that great was my care and skill in these my crafts; yea, I once had the honour of trimming Sir Tho∣mas himself, without fetching blood. Further∣more, I was sought unto to geld the Lady Frances her spaniel, which was wont to go astray: He was called Toby, that is to say, Tobias. And 3dly, I was entrusted with a gorgeous pair of shoes of the saidLady, to set an heel-piece thereon; and I received such praise therefore, that it was said all over the parish, I should be recommended unto the King
<PB N="293" REF="298"/>
to mend shoes for his Majesty: whom God pre∣serve! Amen.</P>
<P>The rest of this chapter I purposely omit, for it must be own'd that when he speaks as a Shoemaker he is very absurd. He talks of Moses's pulling off his <HI>shoes,</HI> of tanning the <HI>hides</HI> of the Bulls of Basan, of Simon the <HI>Tanner,</HI> etc. and takes up four or five pages to prove, that, when the Apostles were instruct∣ed to travel <HI>without shoes,</HI> the precept did not ex∣tend to their successors.</P>
<P>The next chapter relates how he discover'd a Thief with a bible and key, and experimented verses of the Psalms that had cured Agues.</P>
<P>I pass over many others which inform us of parish affairs only, such as of the Succession of <HI>Curates;</HI> a list of the <HI>weekly Texts;</HI> what <HI>Psalms</HI> he chose on proper occasions; and what Children were <HI>born</HI> and <HI>bury'd:</HI> The last of which articles he concludes thus:</P>
<P>That the shame of women may not endure, I speak not of Bastards; neither will I name the Mo∣thers, although thereby I might delight many grave women of the parish: Even her who hath done penance in the sheet will I not mention, forasmuch as the church hath been witness of her disgrace: Let the father, who hath made due composition with the Churchwardens to conceal
<PB N="294" REF="299"/>
his infirmity, rest in peace; my pen shall not be∣wray him, for I also have sinned.</P>
<P>The next chapter contains what he calls a great Revolution in the Church, part of which I tran∣scribe.</P>
<P>Now was the long expected time arrived, when the psalms of King David should be hymn'd unto the same tunes to which he played them upon his harp; (so was I inform'd by my Singing-master, a man right cunning in Psalmody:) Now was our over-abundant quaver and trilling done away, and in lieu thereof was instituted the Sol-fa, in such guise as is sung in his Majesty's Chapel. We had London singing masters sent into every parish, like unto Excise-men; and I also was ordained to ad∣join myself unto them, though an unworthy dis∣ciple, in order to instruct my fellow-parishioners in this new manner of Worship. What tho' they accused me of humming through the nostril, as a Sacbut? yet would I not forego that harmony, it having been agreed by the worthy parish-clerks of London still to preserve the same. I tutored the young men and maidens to tune their voices as it were a psaltery, and the Church on the Sunday was filled with these new Hallelujahs.</P>
<P>Then follow full seventy chapters, containing an exact detail of the <HI>Law-suits</HI> of the Parson and his Parishioners concerning tythes, and near a hundred
<PB N="295" REF="300"/>
pages left blank, with an earnest desire that the <HI>his∣tory might be compleated by any of his successors, in whose time these suits should be ended.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The next chapter contains an account of the Briefs read in the church, and the sums collected upon each.</HI> For the reparation of nine churches, collected at nine several times, 2s. and 7d. ¾. For fifty fami∣lies ruined by fire, 1s. ½. For an inundation, a King Charles's groat given by Lady Frances, etc.</P>
<P><HI>In the next he laments the disuse of Wedding-ser∣mons, and celebrates the benefits arising from those at Funerals, concluding with these Words:</HI> Ah! let not the relations of the deceased grudge the small expence of an hatband, a pair of gloves, and ten shillings, for the satisfaction they are sure to re∣ceive from a pious Divine, that their father, bro∣ther, or bosom wife, are certainly in heaven.</P>
<P><HI>In another, he draws a panegyrick on one Mrs. Margaret Wilkins, but after great encomiums con∣cludes, that, notwithstanding all,</HI> she was an un∣profitable vessel, being a barren woman, and ne∣ver once having furnished God's church with a christening.</P>
<P>We find in another chapter, how he was much stagger'd in his belief, and disturbed in his conscience, by an Oxford scholar, who had proved to him by <HI>lo∣gick, that Animals might have rational, nay, im∣mortal</HI>
<PB N="296" REF="301"/>
<HI>mortal souls;</HI> but how he was again comforted with the reflection, <HI>that, if so, they might be allowed christian burial, and greatly augment the fees of the parish.</HI></P>
<P>In the two following chapters he is overpower'd with Vanity. We are told, how he was constantly admitted to all the feasts and banquets of the Church∣officers, and the speeches he there made for the good of the parish. How he gave hints to young Clergy∣men to preach; but above all, how he gave a Text for the 30th of January, which occasioned a most ex∣cellent sermon, the merits of which he takes entirely to himself. He gives an account of a conference he had with the Vicar concerning the Use of Texts. <HI>Let a preacher (saith he) consider the assembly before whom he preacheth, and unto them adapt his text.</HI> Micah <HI>the iii<SUP>d</SUP> and 11th affordeth good mat∣ter for Courtiers and court-serving men.</HI> The heads of the land judge for reward; and the people there∣of judge for hire; and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? <HI>Were the first Mi∣nister to appoint a preacher before the House of Commons, would not he be wise to make choice of these words?</HI> Give, and it shall be give unto ye. <HI>Or before the Lords,</HI> Giving no offence, that the Ministry be not blamed, <HI>2 Cor. vi. 3. Or praising the warm zeal of an Administration,</HI> Who mak∣eth his Ministers a flaming fire, <HI>Psalm civ. 4.</HI>
<PB N="297" REF="302"/>
<HI>We omit many other of his texts, as too te∣dious.</HI></P>
<P>From this period, the style of the book rises ex∣tremely. Before the next chapter was pasted the Effigies of Dr. <HI>Sacheverel,</HI> and I found the opposite page all on a foam with Politicks.</P>
<P>We are now (says he) arrived at that celebrat∣ed year, in which the Church of England was tried in the person of Dr. Sacheverel. I had ever the interest of our High-Church at heart, neither would I at any season mingle myself in the socie∣ties of Fanaticks, whom I from my infancy ab∣horred, more than the Heathen or Gentile. It was in these days I bethought myself, that much profit might accrue unto our Parish, and even un∣to the Nation, could there be assembled together a number of chosen men of the right spirit, who might argue, refine and define, upon high and great matters. Unto this purpose, I did institute a weekly Assembly of divers worthy men at the Rose and Crown Alehouse, over whom myself (tho' unworthy) did preside. Yea, I did read un∣to them the Post-Boy of Mr. Roper, and the written letter of Mr. Dyer, upon which we com∣muned afterwards among ourselves. Our society was composed of the following persons: Robert Jenkins, Farrier; Amos Turner, Collar-maker; George Pilcocks, late Exciseman; Thomas White,
<PB N="298" REF="303"/>
Wheel-wright; and myself. First, of the first, Robert Jenkins.</P>
<P>He was a man of bright parts and shrewd con∣ceit, for he never shoed an horse of a Whig or a Fanatick, but he lamed him sorely.</P>
<P>Amos Turner, a worthy person, rightly esteem∣ed among us for his sufferings, in that he had been honoured in the stocks for wearing an Oaken bough.</P>
<P>George Pilcocks, a sufferer also; of zealous and laudable freedom of Speech, insomuch that his occupation had been taken from him.</P>
<P>Thomas White, of good repute likewise, for that his uncle, by the Mother's side, had, former∣ly, been servitor at Maudlin college, where the glorious Sacheverel was educated.</P>
<P>Now were the eyes of all the parish upon these our weekly councils. In a short space, the Mi∣nister came among us; he spake concerning us and our councils to a multitude of other Ministers at the Visitation, and they spake thereof unto the Ministers at London, so that even the Bishops heard and marveled thereat. Moreover Sir Tho∣mas, member of Parliament, spake of the same to other members of Parliament; who spake thereof unto the Peers of the Realm. Lo! thus did our counsels enter into the hearts of our Generals and our Law-givers; and from henceforth, even as we devised, thus did they.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="304"/>
After this, the whole book is turned on a sudden, from his own Life, to a History of all the publick Transactions of Europe, compiled from the News∣papers of those times. I could not comprehend the meaning of this, till I perceived at last (to my no small Astonishment) that all the Measures of the four last years of the <HI>Queen,</HI> together with the peace at <HI>Utrecht</HI> which have been usually attributed to the E—of O—, D—of O—, Lords H—and B—, and other great men; do here most plainly appear, to have been wholly owing to Robert Jenkins, Amos Turner, George Pilcocks, Thomas White, but above all, P. P.</P>
<P>The reader may be sure I was very inquisitive af∣ter this extraordinary writer, whose work I have here abstracted. I took a journey into the Country on purpose; but could not find the least trace of him: till by accident I met an old Clergyman, who said be could not be positive, but thought it might be one <HI>Paul Philips,</HI> who had beeen dead about twelve years. And upon enquiry, all he could learn of that person from the neighbourhood, was, That he had been taken notice of for <HI>swallowing Loaches,</HI> and remembered by some people by a <HI>black and white Cur with one Ear,</HI> that constantly followed him.</P>
<P>In the Church-yard, I read his Epitaph, said to be written by himself.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE POET LAUREATE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">November 19, 1729.</HEAD>
<P>THE time of the election of a Poet Laureate being now at hand, it may be proper to give some account of the <HI>rites</HI> and <HI>ceremonies</HI> an∣ciently used at that Solemnity, and only disconti∣nued through the neglect and degeneracy of later times. These we have extracted from an histo∣rian of undoubted credit, a reverend bishop, the learned Paulus Jovius; and are the same that were practised under the pontificate of Leo X, the great restorer of learning.</P>
<P>As we now see an <HI>age</HI> and a <HI>court,</HI> that for the encouragement of poetry rivals, if not exceeds, that of this famous Pope, we cannot but wish a restoration of all its <HI>honours</HI> to <HI>poesy;</HI> the rather, since there are so many parallel circumstances in the <HI>person</HI> who was then honoured with the laurel, and in <HI>him,</HI> who (in all probability) is now to wear it.</P>
<P>I shall translate my author exactly as I find it in the 82d chapter of his Elogia Vir. Doct. He be∣gins
<PB N="302" REF="307"/>
with the character of the poet himself, who was the original and father of all Laureates, and called Camillo. He was a plain country-man of Apulia, (whether a <HI>shepherd</HI> or <HI>thresher,</HI> is not ma∣terial.) "This man (says Jovius) excited by the <Q>“”fame of the great encouragement given to poets at court, and the high honour in which they were held, came to the city, bringing with him a strange kind of lyre in his hand, and at least some <HI>twenty thousand of verses.</HI> All the wits and critics of the court flocked about him, de∣lighted to see a <HI>clown,</HI> with a ruddy, hale com∣plexion, and in his own long hair, so top full of poetry; and at the first sight of him all agreed he was born to be <HI>Poet Laureate</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Apulus praepingui vultu alacer, et prolixe comatus, omni∣no dignus sesta laurea videretur.</NOTE>. He had a most hearty welcome in an <HI>island</HI> of the river Tiber (an agreeable place, not unlike our Rich∣mond) where he was first made to <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink plentifully,</HI> and <HI>to repeat his verses to every body.</HI> Then they adorned him with a new and elegant garland, composed of <HI>vine-leaves, lau∣rel,</HI> and <HI>brassica</HI> (a sort of cabbage) so composed, says my author, emblematically, <HI>Ut tam sales quam lepide ejus temulentia, brassicae remedio cohibenda, notaretur.</HI> He was then saluted by common consent with the title of <HI>archi-poeta,</HI> or <HI>arch-poet,</HI> in the style of those days, in ours, <HI>Poet Laureate.</HI> This honour the poor man received
<PB N="303" REF="308"/>
with the most sensible demonstrations of joy, his eyes drunk with tears and gladness <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Manantibus prae gaudio oculis.</NOTE>. Next, the public acclamation was expressed in a <HI>canticle,</HI> which is transmitted to us, as follows:</Q></P>
<LG>
<L>Salve, brassicea virens corona,</L>
<L>Et lauro, archipoeta, pampinoque!</L>
<L>Dignus principis auribus Leonis.</L>
<L>All hail, arch-poet without peer!</L>
<L>Vine, bay, or cabbage, fit to wear,</L>
<L>And worthy of the <HI>prince's ear.</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>From hence, he was conducted in pomp to the <HI>Capitol</HI> of Rome, mounted on an <HI>elephant,</HI> thro' the shouts of the populace, where the ceremony ended.</P>
<P>The historian tells us further, <Q>“That at his in∣troduction to Leo, he not only poured forth verses innumerable, like a torrent, but also <HI>sung</HI> them with <HI>open mouth.</HI> Nor was he only <HI>once</HI> introduced, or on <HI>stated</HI> days (like our Lau∣reates) but made a <HI>companion</HI> to his <HI>master,</HI> and entertained as one of the instruments of his <HI>most elegant pleasures.</HI> When the prince was at ta∣ble, the poet had his place at the window. When the prince had <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Semesis opsoniis.</NOTE>half eaten his meat, he gave with his own hands the rest to the poet. When the poet drank, it was out of the prince's own flaggon, insomuch (says the historian) that
<PB N="304" REF="309"/>
thro' so great good eating and drinking he con∣tracted a most terrible guot.”</Q> Sorry I am to relate what follows, but that I cannot leave my reader's curiosity unsatisfied in the catastrophe of this extraordinary man. To use my author's words, which are remarkable, <HI>mortuo Leone, pro∣fligatisque poetis, etc.</HI> <Q>“When Leo died, and poets were no more”</Q> (for I would not under∣stand <HI>profligatis</HI> literally, as if poets then were <HI>pro∣fligate)</HI> this unhappy Laureate was forthwith re∣duced to return to his country, where, oppressed with <HI>old age</HI> and <HI>want,</HI> he miserably perished in a <HI>common hospital.</HI></P>
<P>We see from this sad conclusion (which may be of example to the poets of our time) that it were happier to meet with no encouragement at all, to remain at the plough, or other lawful oc∣cupation, than to be elevated above their condi∣tion, and taken out of the common means of life, without a surer support than the <HI>temporary,</HI> or at best, <HI>mortal</HI> favours of the great. It was doubt∣less for this consideration, that when the Royal Bounty was lately extended to a <HI>rural genius,</HI> care was taken to <HI>settle it upon him for life.</HI> And it hath been the practice of our Princes, never to re∣move from the station of Poet Laureate any man who hath once been chosen, tho' never so much greater Genius's might arise in his time. A noble instance, how much the <HI>charity</HI> of our monarchs hath exceeded their <HI>love of fame.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="310"/>
To come now to the intent of this paper. We have here the whole ancient <HI>ceremonial</HI> of the Lau∣reate. In the first place the crown is to be mixed with <HI>vine-leaves,</HI> as the vine is the plant of Bac∣chus, and full as essential to the honour, as the <HI>butt of sack</HI> to the salary.</P>
<P>Secondly, the <HI>brassica</HI> must be made use of as a qualifier of the former. It seems the <HI>cabbage</HI> was anciently accounted a remedy for <HI>drunkenness;</HI> a power the French now ascribe to the onion, and style a soup made of it, <HI>soupe d' Yurogne.</HI> I would recommend a large mixture of the <HI>brassica,</HI> if Mr. Dennis be chosen; but if Mr. Tibbald, it is not so necessary, unless the cabbage be supposed to sig∣nify the same thing with respect to <HI>poets</HI> as to <HI>tay∣lors,</HI> viz. <HI>stealing.</HI> I should judge it not amiss to add another plant to this garland, to wit, <HI>ivy:</HI> Not only as it anciently belonged to poets in gene∣ral; but as it is emblematical of the three virtues of a court poet in particular; it is <HI>creeping, dirty,</HI> and <HI>dangling.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place, a <HI>canticle</HI> must be composed and sung in laud and praise of the new Poet. If Mr. CIBBER be laureated, it is my opinion no man can <HI>write</HI> this but himself: And no man, I am sure, can <HI>sing</HI> it so affectingly. But what this can∣ticle should be, either in his or the other candi∣date's case, I shall not pretend to determine.</P>
<P>Thirdly, there ought to be a <HI>public show,</HI> or <HI>entry</HI> of the poet: To settle the order or proces∣sion
<PB N="306" REF="311"/>
of which, Mr. Anstis and Mr. DENNIS ought to have a conference. I apprehend here two diffi∣culties: One, of procuring an <HI>elephant;</HI> the other of teaching the poet to ride him: Therefore I should imagine the next animal in size or dignity would do best; either a <HI>mule</HI> or a large <HI>ass;</HI> par∣ticularly if that noble one could be had, whose portraiture makes so great an ornament of the <HI>Dun∣ciad,</HI> and which (unless I am misinformed) is yet in the park of a nobleman near this city:—Unless Mr. CIBBER be the man; who may, with great propriety and beauty, ride on a <HI>dragon,</HI> if he goes by land; or if he choose the water, upon one of his own <HI>swans</HI> from <HI>Caesar in Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>We have spoken sufficiently of the <HI>ceremony;</HI> let us now speak of the <HI>qualifications</HI> and <HI>privileges</HI> of the Laureate. First, we see he must be able to make verses <HI>extempore,</HI> and to pour forth innu∣merable, if required. In this I doubt Mr. TIB∣BALD. Secondly, he ought to <HI>sing,</HI> and intre∣pidly, <HI>patulo ore:</HI> Here, I confess the excellency of Mr. CIBBER. Thirdly, he ought to carry a <HI>lyre</HI> about with him: If a large one be thought too cumbersome, a small one may be contrived to hang about the neck, like an order; and be very much a grace to the person. Fourthly, he ought to have a good <HI>stomach,</HI> to eat and drink whatever his betters think fit; and therefore it is in this high office as in many others, no puny constitution can discharge it. I do not think CIB∣BER
<PB N="307" REF="312"/>
or TIBBALD here so happy: but rather a stanch, vigorous, season'd, and dry <HI>old gentleman,</HI> whom I have in my eye.</P>
<P>I could also wish at this juncture, such a per∣son as is truly jealous of the <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>dignity</HI> of <HI>poetry;</HI> no joker, or trifler; but a bard in <HI>good earnest;</HI> nay, not amiss if a critic, and the better if a little <HI>obstinate.</HI> For when we consider what great privileges have been lost from this office (as we see from the fore-cited authentick record of jovius) namely those of <HI>feeding</HI> from the <HI>prince's table, drinking</HI> out of his <HI>own flaggon,</HI> becoming even his <HI>domestick</HI> and <HI>companion;</HI> it requires a man warm and resolute, to be able to claim and obtain the restoring of these high honours. I have cause to fear, most of the candidates would be liable, either through the influence of ministers, or for rewards or favours, to give up the glorious rights of the Laureate: Yet I am not without hopes, there is <HI>one,</HI> from whom a <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>steddy</HI> assertion of these privileges may be ex∣pected; and, if there be such a one, I must do him the justice to say, it is Mr. DENNIS the wor∣thy president of our society.</P>

<P>THOUGH most things which are wrong in their own nature are at once confessed and absolved in that single word, the Custom; yet there are some, which as they have a dangerous tendency, a thinking man will the less excuse on that very account. Among these I cannot but reckon the common practice of <HI>Dedications,</HI> which is of so much the worse consequence as tis gene∣rally used by people of politeness, and whom a learned education for the most part ought to have inspired with nobler and juster sentiments. This prostitution of Praise is not only a deceit upon the gross of mankind, who take their notion of cha∣racters from the Learned; but also the better sort must by this means lose some part at least of that desire of Fame which is the incentive to generous actions, when they find it promiscuously bestowed on the meritorious and underserving. Nay, the author himself, let him be supposed to have ever so true a value for the patron, can find no terms
<PB N="309" REF="314"/>
to express it, but what have been already used, and rendered suspected by flatterers. Even Truth itself in a Dedication is like an honest man in a dis∣guise or Vizor-Masque, and will appear a Cheat by being drest so like one. Tho' the merit of the person is beyond dispute, I see no reason, that, be∣cause one man is eminent, therefore another has a right to be impertinent, and throw praises in his face. 'Tis just the reverse of the practise of the ancient Romans, when a person was advanced to triumph for his services: they hired people to rail at him in that Circumstance, to make him as humble as they could; and we have fellows to flatter him, and make him as proud as they can. Supposing the writer not to be mercenary, yet the great man is no more in reason obliged to thank him for his picture in a Dedication, than to thank the painter for that on a sign-post; except it be a less injury to touch the most sacred part of him, his character, than to make free with his counte∣nance only. I should think nothing justified me in this point, but the patron's permission before∣hand, that I should draw him as like as I could; whereas most authors proceed in this affair just as a dawber I have heard of, who, not being able to draw portraits after the life, was used to paint faces at random, and look out afterwards for peo∣ple whom he might persuade to be like them. To express my notion of the thing in a word: to say more to a man than one thinks, with a pros∣pect

of interest, is dishonest; and without it, fool∣ish. And whoever has had success in such an un∣dertaking, must of necessity at once think himself in his heart a knave for having done it, and his patron a fool for having believed it.</P>
<P>I have sometimes been entertained with consi∣dering Dedications in no very common light. By observing what qualities our writers think it will be most pleasing to others to compliment them with, one may form some judgment which are most so to themselves; and, in consequence, what sort of people they are. Without this view one can read very few Dedications, but will give us cause to wonder, either how such things came to be said at all, or how they were said to such per∣sons. I have known an Hero complimented upon the decent majesty and state he assumed after a victory; and a nobleman of a different character applauded for his condescension to inferiors. This would have seemed very strange to me but that I happened to know the authors: He who made the first compliment was a lofty gentleman, whose air and gait discovered when he had published a new book; and the other tippled every night with the fellows who laboured at the press while his own writings were working off. 'Tis observable of the female poets and ladies dedicatory, that there (as elsewhere) they far exceed us in any strain or rant. As beauty is the thing that sex are piqu'd upon, they speak of it generally in a more elevated
<PB N="311" REF="316"/>
style than is used by the men. They adore in the same manner as they would be adored. So when the authoress of a famous modern romance begs a young Nobleman's permission to pay him her <HI>kneel∣ing adorations,</HI> I am far from censuring the expres∣sion, as some Criticks would do, as deficient in grammar or sense; but I reflect, that adorations paid in that posture are what a lady might expect herself, and my wonder immediately ceases. These, when they flatter most, do but as they would be done unto; for as none are so much concerned at being injured by calumnies, as they who are rea∣diest to cast them upon their neighbours; so, 'tis certain none are so guilty of flattery to others, as those who most ardently desire it themselves.</P>
<P>What led me into these thoughts, was a Dedi∣cation I happened upon, this morning. The rea∣der must understand that I treat the least instances or remains of ingenuity with respect, in what places soever found, or under whatever circum∣stances of disadvantage. From this love to letters I have been so happy in my searches after know∣ledge, that I have found unvalued repositories of learning in the lining of bandboxes. I look upon these pasteboard edifices, adorned with the fragments of the ingenious, with the same venera∣tion as antiquaries upon ruined buildings, whose walls preserve divers inscriptions and names, which are no where else to be found in the world. This morning, when one of Lady Lizard's daughters
<PB N="312" REF="317"/>
was looking over some hoods and ribbands, brought by her tirewoman, with great care and diligence, I employed no less in examining the box which contained them; it was lined with certain scenes of a tragedy, written (as appeared by a part of the title there extant) by one of the fair sex. What was most legible was the Dedication; which, by reason of the largeness of the characters, was least defaced by those Gothick ornaments of flourishes and foliage, wherewith the compilers of these sort of structures do often industriously obscure the works of the learned. As much of it as I could read with any ease, I shall communicate to the reader, as follows. *** <Q>“Though it is a kind of prophanation to approach your Grace with so poor an offering, yet when I reflect how accept∣able a sacrifice of first fruits was to Heaven, in the earliest and purest ages of religion, that they were honoured with solemn feasts, and conse∣crated to altars by a Divine command; *** Upon that consideration, as an argument of particular zeal, I dedicate *** 'Tis impossible to behold you without adoring; yet dazzled and aw'd by the glory that surrounds you, men feel a sacred power, that refines their flames, and renders them pure as those we ought to offer to the Deity. **** The shrine is worthy the divinity that inhabits it. In your Grace we see what woman was before she fell, how nearly allied
<PB N="313" REF="318"/>
to the purity and perfection of Angels. And we adore and bless the glorious work!”</Q></P>
<P>Undoubtedly these, and other periods of this most pious Dedication, could not but convince the Duchess of what the eloquent authoress assures her at the end, that she was her servant with most ardent devotion. I think this a pattern of a new sort of style, not yet taken notice of by the Cri∣ticks, which is above the sublime, and may be called the celestial; that is, when the most sacred praises appropriated to the honour of the deity, are applied to a mortal of good quality. As I am na∣turally emulous, I cannot but endeavour, in imi∣tation of this Lady, to be the inventor, or, at least, the first producer of a new kind of Dedication, very different from hers and most others, since it has not a word but what the author religiously thinks in it. It may serve for almost any book ei∣ther Prose or Verse, that has, is, or shall be pub∣lished; and might run in this manner.</P>

Sir, the honour, affection, and value I have for you are beyond expression; as great, I am sure, or greater, than any man else can bear you. As for any defects which others may pretend to discover in you, I do faithfully declare I was never able to perceive them; and doubt not but those persons are actuated purely by a spirit of malice or envy, the inseparable attendants on shining merit and parts, such as I have always esteemed yours to be. It may perhaps be looked upon as a kind of vio∣lence to modesty, to say this to you in publick; but you may believe me, 'tis no more than I have a thousand times thought of you in private. Might I follow the impulse of my soul, there is no sub∣ject I could launch into with more pleasure than your panegyrick: But since something is due to modesty, let me conclude by telling you, that there's nothing I so much desire as to know you more thoroughly than I have yet the happiness of doing.

<Q>“”AS you profess to encourage all those who any way contribute to the Publick Good, I flatter myself I may claim your Countenance and Protection. I am by Profession a Mad Doctor, but of a peculiar Kind, not of those whose Aim it is to remove Phrenzies, but one who make it my Business to confer an agreeable Madness on my Fellow-Creatures, for their mu∣tual Delight and Benefit. Since it is agreed by the Philosophers, that Happiness and Misery consist chiefly in the Imagination, nothing is more necessary to Mankind in general than this pleasing Delirium, which renders every one sa∣tisfied with himself, and persuades him that all others are equally so.</Q>
<Q>“”I have for several Years, both at home and abroad, made this Science my particular Study, which I may venture to say I have improved in almost all the Courts of Europe; and have re∣duced it into so safe and easy a Method, as to

practice it on both Sexes, of what Disposition, Age, or Quality soever, with Success. What enables me to perform this great Work, is the Use of my <HI>Obsequium Catholicon,</HI> or the <HI>Grand Elixir,</HI> to support the Spirits of human Nature. This Remedy is of the most grateful Flavour in in World, and agrees with all Tastes whatever. 'Tis delicate to the Senses, delightful in the Ope∣ration, may be taken at all Hours without Con∣finement, and is as properly given at a Ball or Play-house as in a private Chamber. It restores and vivifies the most dejected Minds, corrects and extracts all that is painful in the Knowledge of a Man's self. One Dose of it will instantly disperse itself through the whole Animal Sys∣tem, dissipate the first Motions of Distrust so as never to return, and so exhilarate the Brain and rarify the Gloom of Reflexion, as to give the Patients a new flow of Spirits, a Vivacity of Be∣haviour, and a pleasing Dependence upon their own Capacities.</Q>
<Q>“”Let a Person be never so far gone, I advise him not to despair; even though he has been troubled many Years with restless Reflexions, which by long Neglect have hardened into set∣tled Consideration. Those that have been strung with Satire may here find a certain Antidote, which infallibly disperses all the Remains of Poison that has been left in the Understanding by bad Cures. It fortifies the Heart against the

<Q><L>Compulerantque greges Corydon et Thyrsis in unum:</L>
<L>Ex illo Corydon, Corydon est tempore nobis.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. I Designed to have troubled the reader with no further discourses of Pastoral; but being informed that I am taxed of partiality in not men∣tioning an Author whose Eclogues are published in the same volume with Mr. Philips's, I shall employ this paper in observations upon him, written in the free Spirit of Criticism, and without any appre∣hension of offending that Gentleman, whose cha∣racter it is, that he takes the greatest care of his works before they are published, and has the least concern for them afterwards.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have laid it down as the first rule of Pas∣toral, that its idea should be taken from the man∣ners of the Golden Age, and the Moral formed upon the representation of Innocence; 'tis there∣fore plain that any deviations from that design de∣grade a Poem from being truly pastoral. In this view it will appear, that Virgil can only have two of his Eclogues allowed to be such: his first and ninth must be rejected, because they describe the ravages of armies, and oppressions of the innocent;
<PB N="322" REF="327"/>
Corydon's criminal passion for Alexis throws out the second; the calumny and railing in the third are not proper to that state of concord; the eighth represents unlawful ways of procuring love by in∣chantments, and introduces a shepherd whom an inviting precipice tempts to self-murder: As to the fourth, sixth, and tenth, they are given up by <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Rapin de Carm. par. iii.</NOTE>Heinsius, Salmasius, Rapin, and the criticks in general. They likewise observe that but eleven of all the Idyllia of Theocritus are to admitted as pastorals: and even out of that number the greater part will be excluded for one or other of the rea∣sons abovementioned. So that when I remarked in a former paper, that Virgil's eclogues, taken alto∣gether, are rather Select poems than Pastorals; I might have said the same thing with no less truth of Theocritus. The reason of this I take to be yet unobserved by the criticks, viz. They never meant them all for pastorals.</P>
<P>Now it is plain Philips hath done this, and in that particular excelled both Theocritus and Virgil.</P>
<P N="3">3. As Simplicity is the distinguishing characte∣ristick of Pastoral, Virgil hath been thought guil∣ty of too courtly a style; his language is perfectly pure, and he often forgets he is among peasants. I have frequently wondered, that since he was so con∣versant in the writings of Ennius, he had not imi∣tated the rusticity of the Doric as well by the help
<PB N="323" REF="328"/>
of the old obsolete Roman language, as Philips hath by the antiquated English: For example, might he not have said <HI>quoi</HI> instead of <HI>cui; quoi∣jum</HI> for <HI>cujum; volt</HI> for <HI>vult,</HI> etc. as well as our modern hath <HI>welladay</HI> for <HI>alas, whileome</HI> for <HI>of old, make mock</HI> for <HI>deride,</HI> and <HI>witless younglings</HI> for <HI>sim∣ple lambs,</HI> etc. by which means he had attained as much of the air of Theocritus, as Philips hath of Spencer?</P>
<P N="4">4. Mr. Pope hath fallen into the same error with Virgil. His clowns do not converse in all the simplicity proper to the country: His names are borrowed from Theocritus and Virgil, which are improper to the scene of his pastorals. He intro∣duces Daphnis, Alexis, and Thyrsis on British plains, as Virgil had done before him on the Mantuan: Whereas Philips, who hath the strictest regard to propriety, makes choice of names peculiar to the country, and more agreeable to a reader of deli∣cacy; such as Hobbinol, Lobbin, Cuddy and Co∣lin Clout.</P>
<P N="5">5. So easy as pastoral writing may seem (in the simplicity we have described it) yet it requires great reading, both of the ancients and moderns, to be a master of it. Philips hath given us mani∣fest proofs of his knowledge of books. It must be confessed his competitor hath imitated <HI>some sin∣gle thoughts</HI> of the ancients well enough (if we con∣sider he had not the happiness of an University education) but he hath dispersed them here and
<PB N="324" REF="329"/>
there, without that order and method which Mr. Philips observes, whose <HI>whole</HI> third pastoral is an instance how well he hath studied the fifth of Vir∣gil, and how judiciously reduced Virgil's thoughts to the standard of Pastoral; as his contention of Colin Clout and the Nightingale shows with what exactness he hath imitated every line in Strada.</P>
<P N="6">6. When I remarked it as a principal fault, to introduce fruits and flowers of a foreign growth, in descriptions where the scene lies in our own country, I did not design that observation should extend also to animals, or the sensitive life; for Mr. Philips hath with great judgment described Wolves in England in his first pastoral. Nor would I have a poet slavishly confine himself (as Mr. Pope hath done) to one particular Season of the year, one certain Time of the day, and one unbroken Scene in each eclogue. 'Tis plain Spencer neglected this pedantry, who in his pasto∣ral of November mentions the mournful song of the Nightingale,
<Q><L>Sad Philomel her song in tears doth steep.</L></Q>
And Mr. Philips, by a poetical creation, hath raised up finer beds of flowers than the most indus∣trious gardiner; his roses, endives, lilies, king∣cups, and daffidils, blow all in the same season.</P>
<P N="7">7. But the better to discover the merits of our two contemporary Pastoral writers, I shall endea∣vour to draw a parallel of them, by setting several
<PB N="325" REF="330"/>
of their particular thoughts in the same light, where∣by it will be obvious how much Philips hath the advantage. With what simplicity he introduces two shepherds singing alternately?</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Hobb.</HI> Come, Rosalind, O come, for without thee</L>
<L>What pleasure can the country have for me?</L>
<L>Come, Rosalind, O come; my brinded kine,</L>
<L>My snowy sheep, my farm and all, is thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Lanq.</HI> Come, Rosalind, O come; here shady bowers,</L>
<L>Here are cool fountains, and here springing flowers.</L>
<L>Come, Rosalind; here ever let us stay,</L>
<L>And sweetly wast our live-long time away.</L>
</LG>
<P>Our other pastoral writer, in expressing the same thought, deviates into downright Poetry:</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Streph.</HI> In Spring the fields, in Autumn hills I love,</L>
<L>At morn the plains, at noon the shady grove,</L>
<L>But Delia always; forc'd from Delia's sight,</L>
<L>Nor plains at morn, nor groves at noon delight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Daph.</HI> Sylvia's like Autumn ripe, yet mild as May,</L>
<L>More bright than noon, yet fresh as early day;</L>
<L>Ev'n Spring displeases, when she shines not here,</L>
<L>But blest with her, 'tis Spring throughout the year.</L>
</LG>
<P>In the first of these authors, two shepherds thus innocently describe the behaviour of their mis∣tresses:</P>
<SP>
<PB N="326" REF="331" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>Hobb.</SPEAKER>
<L>As Marian bath'd, by chance I passed by,</L>
<L>She blush'd, and at me cast a side-long eye:</L>
<L>Then swift beneath the crystal wave she try'd</L>
<L>Her beauteous form, but all in vain, to hide.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lanq.</SPEAKER>
<L>As I cool me bath'd one sultry day,</L>
<L>Fond Lydia lurking in the sedges lay.</L>
<L>The wanton laugh'd, and seem'd in haste to fly;</L>
<L>Yet often stopp'd, and often turn'd her eye.</L>
</SP>
<P>The other modern (who it must be confessed hath a knack of versifying) hath it as follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Streph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Me gentle Delia beckons from the plain,</L>
<L>Then, hid in shades, eludes her eager swain;</L>
<L>But feigns a Laugh, to see me search around,</L>
<L>And by that Laugh the willing fair is found.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daph.</SPEAKER>
<L>The sprightly Sylvia trips along the green,</L>
<L>She runs, but hopes she does not run unseen;</L>
<L>While a kind glance at her pursuer flies,</L>
<L>How much at variance are her feet and eyes!</L>
</SP>
<P>There is nothing the writers of this kind of poetry are fonder of than descriptions of pastoral Presents. Philips says thus of a Sheep-hook,</P>
<LG>
<L>Of season'd elm; where studs of brass appear,</L>
<L>To speak the giver's name, the month and year;</L>
<L>The hook of polish'd steel, the handle turn'd,</L>
<L>And richly by the graver's skill adorn'd.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="327" REF="332"/>
The other of a bowl embossed with figures:</P>
<LG>
<L>where wanton ivy twines,</L>
<L>And swelling clusters bend the curling vines;</L>
<L>Four figures rising from the work appear,</L>
<L>The various seasons of the rolling year;</L>
<L>And, what is that which binds the radiant sky,</L>
<L>Where twelve bright signs in beauteous order lie?</L>
</LG>
<P>The simplicity of the swain in this place, who for∣gets the name of the Zodiack, is no ill imitation of Virgil: but how much more plainly and unaf∣fectedly would Philips have dressed this thought in his Doric?
<Q><L>And what that hight, which girds the welkin sheen,</L>
<L>Where twelve gay signs in meet array are seen?</L></Q></P>
<P>If the reader would indulge his curiosity any fur∣ther in the comparison of particulars, he may read the first pastoral of Philips with the second of his contemporary, and the fourth and sixth of the former with the fourth and first of the latter; where several parallel places will occur to every one.</P>
<P>Having now shown some parts, in which these two writers may be compared, it is a justice I owe to Mr. Philips to discover those in which no man can compare with him. First, That beautiful rus∣ticity, of which I shall only produce two instances out of a hundred not yet quoted:
<Q><PB N="328" REF="333"/>
<L>O woful day! O day of woe! quoth he,</L>
<L>And woful I, who live the day to see!</L></Q></P>
<P>The simplicity of diction, the melancholy flowing of the numbers, the solemnity of the sound, and the easy turn of the words in this Dirge (to make use of our author's expression) are extremely ele∣gant.</P>
<P>In another of his pastorals, a shepherd utters a Dirge not much inferior to the former, in the fol∣lowing lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>Ah me the while! ah me! the luckless day,</L>
<L>Ah luckless lad! the rather might I say;</L>
<L>Ah silly I! more silly than my sheep,</L>
<L>Which on the flow'ry plains I once did keep.</L>
</LG>
<P>How he still charms the ear with these artful re∣petitions of the epithets; and how significant is the last verse! I desy the most common reader to re∣peat them, without feeling some motions of com∣passion.</P>
<P>In the next place I shall rank his Proverbs, in which I formerly observed he excells: For ex∣ample:</P>
<LG>
<L>A rolling stone is ever bare of moss;</L>
<L>And, to their cost, green years old proverbs cross.</L>
<L>—He that late lies down, as late will rise,</L>
<L>And sluggard-like, till noon-day snoaring lies.</L>
<L><PB N="329" REF="334"/>
—Against Ill-luck all cunning fore-sight fails;</L>
<L>Whether we sleep or wake, it naught avails.</L>
<L>—Nor fear, from upright sentence, wrong.</L>
</LG>
<P>Lastly, his elegant Dialect, which alone might prove him the eldest born of Spencer, and our on∣ly true Arcadian. I should think it proper for the several writers of Pastoral, to confine themselves to their several Counties. Spencer seems to have been of this opinion: for he hath laid the scene of one of his Pastorals in Wales; where with all the simplicity natural to that part of our island, one shepherd bids the other good morrow, in an un∣usual and elegant manner:
<Q><L>Diggon Davy, I bid hur God-day:</L>
<L>Or Diggon hur is, or I mis-say.</L></Q></P>
<P>Diggon answers:
<Q><L>Hur was hur, while it was day-light;</L>
<L>But now hur is a most wretched wight, etc.</L></Q></P>
<P>But the most beautiful example of this kind that I ever met with, is in a very valuable piece which I chanced to find among some old manuscripts, entituled, A Pastoral Ballad: which I think, for its nature and simplicity, may (notwithstanding the modesty of the title) be allowed a perfect Pas∣toral. It is composed in the Somersetshire dia∣lect, and the names such as are proper to the country people. It may be observed as a further beauty of this Pastoral, the words Nymph, Dryad,
<PB N="330" REF="335"/>
Naiad, Fawn, Cupid, or Satyr, are not once men∣tioned throughout the whole. I shall make no apology for inserting some few lines of this excel∣lent piece. Cicily breaks thus into the subject, as she is going a milking:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cicily.</SPEAKER>
<L>Rager, go vetch tha <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">That is, the Kine or Cows.</NOTE>Kee, or else tha Zun</L>
<L>Will quite be go, bevore c'have half a don.</L>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thou shouldst not ax ma tweece, but I've a bee</L>
<L>To dreve our bull to bull tha Parson's Kee.</L>
</SP>
<P>It is to be observed, that this whole dialogue is formed upon the passion of <HI>Jealousy;</HI> and his men∣tioning the Parson's Kine naturally revives the jea∣lousy of the shepherdess Cicily, which she expresses as follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cicily.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ah Rager, Rager, ches was zore avraid,</L>
<L>When in you Vield you kiss'd the Parson's maid:</L>

<P>I am loth to show my fondness for antiquity so far as to prefer this ancient British author to our pre∣sent English Writers of Pastoral; but I cannot avoid making this obvious remark, that Philips hath hit into the same road with this old West Country Bard of ours.</P>
<P>After all that hath been said, I hope none can think it any injustice to Mr. Pope that I forebore to mention him as a Pastoral writer; since, upon the whole, he is of the same class with Moschus and Bion, whom we have excluded that rank; and of whose Eclogues, as well as some of Virgil's, it may be said, that (according to the description we have given of this sort of poetry) they are by no means Pastorals, but something better.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Cannot think it extravagant to imagine, that mankind are no less, in proportion, account∣able for the ill use of their dominion over creatures of the lower rank of beings, than for the exercise of tyranny over their own Species. The more entirely the inferior creation is submitted to our power, the more answerable we should seem for our mismanagement of it; and the rather, as the very condition of nature renders these creatures in∣capable of receiving any recompence in another life for their ill treatment in this.</P>
<P>'Tis observable of those noxious animals, which have qualities most powerful to injure us, that they naturally avoid mankind, and never hurt us unless provoked, or necessitated by hunger. Man, on the other hand, seeks out and pursues even the most inoffensive animals, on purpose to persecute and destroy them.</P>
<P>Montaigne thinks it some reflection upon hu∣man nature itself, that few people take delight in seeing beasts caress or play together, but almost every one is pleased to see them lacerate and wor∣ry one another. I am sorry this temper is become
<PB N="333" REF="338"/>
almost a distinguishing character of our own na∣tion, from the observation which is made by fo∣reigners of our beloved pastimes, Bear-baiting, Cock-fighting, and the like. We should find it hard to vindicate the destroying of any thing that has life, merely out of wantonness; yet in this principle our children are bred up, and one of the first pleasures we allow them, is the licence of in∣flicting pain upon poor animals: almost as soon as we are sensible what life is ourselves, we make it our sport to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good use might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and insects. Mr. Locke takes notice of a mother who permit∣ted them to her children, but rewarded or punish∣ed them as they treated them well or ill. This was no other than entering them betimes into a dai∣ly exercise of humanity, and improving their very diversion to a virtue.</P>
<P>I fancy too, some advantage might be taken of the common notion, that 'tis ominous or unlucky, to destroy some sorts of birds, as Swallows and Martins. This opinion might possibly arise from the confidence these birds seem to put in us by building under our roofs, so that it is a kind of violation of the laws of hospitality to murder them. As for Robin-red-breasts in particular, 'tis not im∣probable they owe their security to the old ballad of <HI>The Children in the Wood.</HI> However it be, I don't know, I say, why this prejudice, well im∣proved
<PB N="334" REF="339"/>
and carried as far as it would go, might not be made to conduce to the preservation of many in∣nocent creatures, which are now exposed to all the wantonness of an ignorant barbarity.</P>
<P>There are other animals that have the misfor∣tune, for no manner of reason, to be treated as common enemies where-ever found. The conceit that a Cat has nine lives has cost at least nine lives in ten of the whole race of them: scarce a boy in the streets but has in this point outdone Hercules himself, who was famous for killing a monster that had but three lives. Whether the unaccount∣able animosity against this useful domestick may be any cause of the general persecution of Owls (who are a sort of feathered cats) or whether it be only an unreasonable pique the moderns have taken to a serious countenance, I shall not determine. Tho' I am inclined to believe the former; since I ob∣serve the sole reason alledged for the destruction of Frogs is because they are like Toads. Yet amidst all the misfortunes of these unfriended creatures, 'tis some happiness that we have not yet taken a fancy to eat them: for should our countrymen re∣fine upon the French never so little, 'tis not to be conceived to what unheard-of torments owls, cats, and frogs may be yet reserved.</P>
<P>When we grow up to men, we have another succession of Sanguinary sports; in particular hunt∣ing. I dare not attack a diversion which has such authority and custom to support it; but must have
<PB N="335" REF="340"/>
leave to be of opinion, that the agitation of that exercise, with the example and number of the cha∣sers, not a little contribute to resist those checks, which compassion would naturally suggest in be∣half of the animal pursued. Nor shall I say with Monsieur Fleury, that this sport is a remain of the Gothic barbarity; but I must animadvert upon a certain custom yet in use with us, and barbarous enough to be derived from the Goths, or even the Scythians: I mean that savage compliment our huntsmen pass upon Ladies of quality, who are present at the death of a Stag, when they put the knife in their hands to cut the throat of a helpless, trembling and weeping creature.
<Q><L>Questuque cruentus,</L>
<L>Atque Imploranti similis.—</L></Q></P>
<P>But if our sports are destructive, our gluttony is more so, and in a more inhuman manner. Lob∣sters roasted alive, Pigs whipp'd to death, Fowls sewed up, are testimonies of our outragious lux∣ury. Those, who (as Seneca expresses it) divide their lives betwixt an anxious conscience, and a nau∣seated stomach, have a just reward of their glut∣tony in the diseases it brings with it: for human savages, like other wild beasts, find snares and poy∣son in the provisions of life, and are allured by their appetite to their destruction. I know nothing more shocking, or horrid, than the prospect of one of their kitchins covered with blood, and fill∣ed
<PB N="336" REF="341"/>
with the cries of creatures expiring in tortures▪ It gives one an image of a Giant's den in a ro∣mance bestraw'd with the scattered heads and man∣gled limbs of those who were slain by his cruelty.</P>
<P>The excellent Plutarch (who has more strokes of good-nature in his writings than I remember in any author) cites a saying of Cato to this effect: <Q>“That 'tis no easy task to preach to the belly which has no ears. Yet if (says he) we are ashamed to be so out of fashion as not to offend, let us at least offend with some discretion and measure. If we kill an animal for our provision, let us do it with the meltings of compassion, and without tor∣menting it. Let us consider, that 'tis in its own nature cruelty to put a living creature to death; we at least destroy a soul that has sense and per∣ception.”</Q> In the life of Cato the Censor, he takes occasion from the severe disposition of that man to discourse in this manner: <Q>“It ought to be esteemed a happiness to mankind, that our hu∣manity has a wider sphere to exert itself in, than bare justice. It is no more than the obligation of our very birth to practise equity to our own kind; but humanity may be extended thro' the whole order of creatures, even to the meanest: such actions of charity are the over-flowings of a mild good nature on all below us. It is cer∣tainly the part of a well-natured man to take care of his horses and dogs, not only in expec∣tation
<PB N="337" REF="342"/>
of their labour while they are foals and whelps, but even when their old age has made them incapable of service.”</Q></P>
<P>History tells us of a wise and polite nation, that rejected a person of the first quality, who stood for a judiciary office, only because he had been observed in his youth to take pleasure in tearing and murdering of birds. And of another, that ex∣pelled a man out of the senate for dashing a bird against the ground which had taken shelter in his bosom. Every one knows how remarkable the Turks are for their humanity in this kind. I re∣member an Arabian author, who has written a treatise to shew, how far a man, supposed to have subsisted in a desert island, without any instruc∣tion, or so much as the sight of any other man, may, by the pure light of nature, attain the know∣ledge of philosophy and virtue. One of the first things he makes him observe is, that universal be∣nevolence of nature in the protection and preser∣vation of its creatures. In imitation of which, the first act of virtue he thinks his self-taught philoso∣pher would of course fall into is, to relieve and assist all the animals about him in their wants and distresses.</P>
<P>Ovid has some very tender and pathetick lines applicable to this occasion:</P>
<LG>
<L>Quid meruistis, oves, placidum pecus, inque tegendos</L>
<L>Natum homines, pleno quae fertis in ubere nectar?</L>
<L><PB N="338" REF="343"/>
Mollia quae nobis vestras velamina lanas</L>
<L>Praebetis; vitaque magis quam morte juvatis.</L>
<L>Quid meruere boves, animal sine fraude dolisque,</L>
<L>Innocuum, simplex, natum tolerare labores?</L>
<L>Immemor est demum, nec frugum munere dignus,</L>
<L>Qui potuit, curvi dempto modo pondere aratri,</L>
<L>Ruricolam mactare suum—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quam male consuevit, quam se parat ille cruori</L>
<L>Impius humano, vituli qui guttura cultro</L>
<L>Rumpit, et immotas praebet mugitibus aures!</L>
<L>Aut qui vagitus fimiles puerilibus hoedum</L>
<L>Edentem jugulare potest!—</L>
</LG>
<P>Perhaps that voice or cry so nearly resembling the human, with which providence has endued so many different animals, might purposely be given them to move our pity, and prevent those cruel∣ties we are too apt to inflict on our fellow crea∣tures.</P>
<P>There is a passage in the book of Jonas, when God declares his unwillingness to destroy Nineveh, where, methinks, that compassion of the creator, which extends to the meanest rank of his crea∣tures, <Q>is expressed with wonderful tenderness—“Should I not spare Nineveh the great city, wherein are more than six thousand persons—And also much cattel?”</Q> And we have in Deu∣teronomy a precept of great good nature of this sort with a blessing in form annexed to it in those words: <Q>“”If thou shalt find a bird's nest in the
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
way, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, that it may be well with thee, and that thou may'st prolong thy days.</Q></P>
<P>To conclude, there is certainly a degree of gra∣titude owing to those animals that serve us; as for such as are mortal or noxious, we have a right to destroy them; and for those that are neither of advantage or prejudice to us, the common enjoy∣ment of life is what I cannot think we ought to deprive them of.</P>
<P>This whole-matter, with regard to each of these considerations, is set in a very agreeable light in one of the Persian fables of Pilpay, with which I shall end this paper.</P>
<P>A traveller passing thro' a thicket, and seeing a few sparks of a fire, which some passengers had kindled as they went that way before, made up to it. On a sudden the sparks caught hold of a bush, in the midst of which lay an adde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and set it in flames. The adder intreated the traveller's assist∣ance, who tying a bag to the end of his staff, reached it, and drew him out: he then bid him go where he pleased, but never more be hurt∣ful to men, since he owed his life to a man's compassion. The adder, however, prepared to sting him, and when he expostulated how unjust it was to retaliate good with evil, I shall do no more (said the adder) than what you men practice every day, whose custom it is to requite
<PB N="340" REF="345"/>
benefits with ingratitude. If you can deny this truth, let us refer it to the first we meet. The man consented, and seeing a Tree, put the ques∣tion to it, in what manner a good turn was to be recompenced? If you mean according to the usage of Men (reply'd the Tree) By its contrary. I have been standing here these hundred years to protect them from the scorching sun, and in requital they have cut down my branches, and are going to saw my body into planks. Upon this the adder insult∣ing the man, he appealed to a second evidence, which was granted, and immediately they met a Cow. The same demand was made, and much the same answer given, that among men it was cer∣tainly so: I know it, said the Cow, by woful ex∣perience; for I have served a man this long time with milk, butter and cheese, and brought him besides a Calf every year: but now I am old, he turns me into this pasture, with design to sell me to a butcher, who will shortly make an end of me. The traveller upon this stood con∣founded, but desired of courtesy one trial more, to be finally judged by the next beasts they should meet. This happened to be the Fox, who upon hearing the story in all its circumstances, could not be persuaded it was possible for the adder to get into so narrow a bag. The adder to convince him went in again; the Fox told the man he had now his enemy in his power, and with that he fasten∣ed the bag, and crushed him to pieces.</P>

<HEAD>To NESTOR IRONSIDE, Esq;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>“”I Remember a saying of yours concerning per∣sons in low circumstances of stature, that their littleness would hardly be taken notice of, if they did not manifest a consciousness of it themselves in all their behaviour. Indeed the observation that no man is ridiculous for being what he is, but only for the affectation of being something more, is equally true in regard to the mind and the body.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”I question not but it will be pleasing to you to hear, that a sett of us have formed a society, who are sworn to dare to be short, and boldly bear out the dignity of littleness under the noses of those enormous engrossers of manhood, those hyperbolical monsters of the Species, the tall fellows that overlook us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”The day of our institution was the tenth of December, being the shortest of the year, on which we are to hold an annual Feast over a dish of Shrimps.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="347"/>
<Q>“”The place we have chosen for this meeting is in the little Piazza, not without an eye to the neighbourhood of Mr. Powel's Opera, for the performers of which, we have, as becomes us, a brotherly affection.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”At our first resort hither, an old woman brought her son to the Club Room, desiring he might be educated in this School, because she saw here were finer Boys than ordinary. How∣ever, this accident no way discouraged our de∣signs. We began with sending invitations to those of a stature not exceeding five foot, to re∣pair to our assembly; but the greater part re∣turned excuses, or pretended they were not qua∣lified.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”One said, he was indeed but five foot at pre∣sent, but represented that he should soon ex∣ceed that proportion, his perriwig-maker and shoe-maker having lately promised him three inches more betwixt them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Another alledged, he was so unfortunate as to have one leg shorter than the other, and who∣ever had determined his stature to five foot, had taken him at a disadvantage; for when he was mounted on the other leg, he was at least five foot two inches and a half.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”There were some who questioned the exactness of our measures, and others instead of complying, returned us informations of people yet shorter than themselves. In a word, almost every one
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
recommended some neighbour or acquaintance, whom he was willing we should look upon to be less than he. We were not a little ashamed, that those who are past the years of growth, and whose beards pronounce them men, should be guilty of as many unfair tricks, in this point, as the most aspiring children when they are measured.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”We therefore proceeded to fit up the Club-Room, and provide conveniencies for our ac∣commodation. In the first place we caused a total removal of all the chairs, stools, and tables, which had served the gross of mankind for many years.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”The disadvantages we had undergone while we made use of these, were unspeakable. The President's whole body was sunk in the elbow-chair, and when his arms were spread over it, he appeared (to the great lessening of his dig∣nity) like a child in a go-cart: It was also so wide in the seat, as to give a wag occasion of saying, that, notwithstanding the President sate in it,</Q> there was a <HI>Sede Vacante.</HI></P>
<P><Q>“”The table was so high, that one who came by chance to the door, seeing our chins just above the pewter dishes, took us for a circle of men that sate ready to be shaved, and sent in half a dozen Barbers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Another time, one of the Club spoke in a lu∣di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous manner of the President, imagining he
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
had been absent, when he was only eclipsed by a flask of Florence, which stood on the table in a parallel line before his face.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”We therefore new furnished the room in all respects proportionably to us; and had the door made lower, so as to admit no man of above five foot high without brushing his foretop, which whoever does is utterly unqualified to sit among us.</Q></P>
<Q><L>Some of the Statutes of the Club are as follow.</L></Q>
<P><Q>“”I. If it be proved upon any member, though never so duly qualified, that he strives as much as possible to get above his size, by stretching, cocking, or the like; or that he hath stood on tiptoe in a crowd, with design to be taken for as tall a man as the rest; or hath privily conveyed any large book, cricket, or other device under him to exalt him on his seat: every such offender shall be sentenced to walk in pumps for a whole month.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”II. If any member shall take advantage from the fulness or length of his wig, or any part of his dress, or the immoderate extent of his hat, or otherwise, to seem larger or higher than he is, it is ordered, he shall wear red heels to his shoes, and a red feather in his hat; which may appa∣rently mark and set bounds to the extremities of his small dimension, that all people may readily find him out between his hat and his shoes.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="350"/>
<Q>“”III. If any member shall purchase a horse for his own riding, above fourteen hands and a half in height; that horse shall forthwith be sold, a Scotch galloway bought in its stead for him, and the overplus of the money shall treat the Club.</Q></P>
<Q>“”IV. If any member, in direct contradiction to the fundamental laws of the Society, shall wear the heels of his shoes exceeding one inch and half; it shall be interpreted as an open re∣nunciation of littleness, and the criminal shall instantly be expelled. Note, The form to be used in expelling a member shall be in these words; Go from among us, and be tall if you can!</Q>
<Q>“”It is the unanimous opinion of our whole so∣ciety, that since the race of mankind is granted to have decreased in stature, from the beginning to this present, it is the intent of Nature itself, that men should be little; and we believe, that all human kind shall at last grow down to per∣fection, that is to say, be reduced to <HI>our own measure.</HI></Q>

<P><Q>“”YOU are now acquainted with the nature and design of our institution; the Cha∣racter of the members, and the topicks of our Conversation, are what remain for the subject of this Epistle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”The most eminent persons of our assembly are a little Poet, a little Lover, a little Politician, and a little Heroe. The first of these, Dick Distick by name, we have elected President: not only as he is the shortest of us all, but be∣cause he has entertained so just a sense of his stature, as to go generally in black, that he may appear yet less. Nay, to that perfection is he arrived, that he stoops as he walks. The figure of the man is odd enough; he is a lively little creature, with long arms and legs: a Spi∣der is no ill emblem of him: he has been taken at a distance for a small Windmill. But indeed what principally moved us in his favour was his talent in Poetry, for he hath promised to under∣take a long work in short verse to celebrate the
<PB N="347" REF="352"/>
heroes of our size. He has entertained so great a respect for Statius, on the score of that line,
<Q><L>Major in exiguo regnabat corpore virtus,</L></Q>
that he once designed to translate the whole Thebaid for the sake of little Tydeus.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Tom Tiptoe, a dapper black fellow, is the most gallant lover of the age. He is parti∣cularly nice in his habiliments; and to the end justice may be done him that way, constantly employs the same artist who makes attire for the neighb'ring Princes and Ladies of quality at Mr. Powel's. The vivacity of his temper inclines him sometimes to boast of the favours of the Fair. He was t'other night excusing his absence from the club on account of an assignation with a Lady (and, as he had the vanity to tell us, a tall one too) who had consented to the full ac∣complishment of his desires that evening: But one of the company, who was his confident, assured us she was a woman of humour, and made the agreement on this condition, that his toe should be tied to hers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Our Politician is a person of real gravity, and professed wisdom: Gravity in a man of this size, compared with that of one of ordinary bulk, appears like the gravity of a Cat compared with that of a Lion. This gentleman is accustom∣ed to talk to himself, and was once over-heard to compare his own person to a little cabinet,
<PB N="348" REF="353"/>
wherein are locked up all the secrets of state, and refined schemes of Princes. His face is pale and meagre, which proceeds from much watch∣ing and studying for the welfare of Europe, which is also thought to have stinted his growth: for he hath destroyed his own constitution with tak∣ing care of that of the nation. He is what Mons. Balzac calls, a great Distiller of the max∣ims of Tacitus: when he speaks, it is slowly, and word by word, as one that is loth to enrich you too fast with his observations; like a lim∣beck that gives you, drop by drop, an extract of the little that is in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”The last I shall mention is Tim. Tuck, the Hero. He is particularly remarkable for the length of his Sword, which intersects his per∣son in a cross line, and makes him appear not unlike a Fly that the boys have run a pin thro', and set a walking. He once challenged a tall fellow for giving him a blow on the pate with his elbow, as he passed along the street. But what he especially values himself upon is, that in all the campaigns he has made, he never once duck'd at the whizz of a cannon ball. Tim. was full as large at fourteen years old as he is now. This we are tender of mentioning, your little Heroes being generally cholerick.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”These are the gentlemen that most enliven our conversation. The discourse generally turns upon such accidents, whether fortunate or un∣fortunate,
<PB N="349" REF="354"/>
as are daily occasioned by our size: these we faithfully communicate, either as mat∣ter of mirth or of consolation to each other. The President had lately an unlucky fall, being unable to keep his legs on a stormy day; where∣upon he informed us it was no new disaster, but the same a certain ancient Poet had been subject to; who is recorded to have been so light that he was obliged to poize himself against the wind, with lead on one side, and his own works on the other. The Lover confest the other night that he had been cured of love to a tall woman, by reading over the legend of Ragotine in Scar∣ron, with his tea, three mornings successively. Our Hero rarely acquaints us with any of his unsuccessful adventures: and as for the Politici∣an, he declares himself an utter enemy to all kind of burlesque, so will never discompose the austerity of his aspect by laughing at our adven∣tures, much less discover any of his own in this ludicrous light. Whatever he tells of any ac∣cidents that befal him, is by way of complaint, nor is he ever laugh'd at but in his <HI>Absence.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>“”We are likewise particularly careful to com∣municate in the club all such passages of history, or characters of illustrious personages, as any way reflect honour on little men. Tim. Tuck having but just reading enough for a military man, perpetually entertains us with the same stories, of little David that conquered the mighty
<PB N="350" REF="355"/>
Goliah, and little Luxembourg that made Louis xiv. a grand Monarque, never forgetting lit∣tle Alexander the great. Dick Distick celebrates the exceeding humanity of Augustus, who call∣ed Horace <HI>lepidissimum homunciolum;</HI> and is won∣derfully pleased with Voiture and Scarron, for having so well described their diminutive forms to posterity. He is peremptorily of opinion, against a great Reader and all his adherents, that Aesop was not a jot properer or handsomer than he is represented by the common pictures. But the Soldier believes with the learned person above-mentioned; for he thinks none but an impudent tall author could be guilty of such an unmannerly piece of satire on little warriors, as his Battle of the Mouse and the Frog. The Politician is very proud of a certain King of Egypt, called Bocchor, who, as Diodorus as∣sures us, was a person of a very low stature, but far exceeded all that went before him in discre∣tion and politicks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”As I am Secretary to the club, 'tis my busi∣ness, whenever we meet, to take minutes of the transactions: this has enabled me to send you the foregoing particulars, as I may hereafter other memoirs. We have spies appointed in every quarter of the town, to give us informa∣tions of the misbehaviour of such refractory per∣sons as refuse to be subject to our statutes. Whatsoever aspiring practices any of these our
<PB N="351" REF="356"/>
people shall be guilty of in their Amours, single Combats, or any indirect means to manhood, we shall certainly be acquainted with, and pub∣lish to the world, for their punishment and re∣formation. For the President has granted me the sole propriety of exposing and shewing to the town all such intractable Dwarfs, whose cir∣cumstances exempt them from being carried about in Boxes: reserving only to himself, as the right of a Poet, those smart characters that will shine in Epigrams.

<P>I Lately took a particular friend of mine to my house in the country, not without some ap∣prehension, that it could afford little entertainment to a man of his polite taste, particularly in archi∣tecture and gardening, who had so long been con∣versant with all that is beautiful and great in ei∣ther.
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
But it was a pleasant surprize to me, to hear him often declare he had found in my little retire∣ment that beauty which he always thought want∣ing in the most celebrated seats (or, if you will, Villa's) of the nation. This he described to me in those verses with which Martial begins one of his epigrams:</P>
<LG>
<L>Baiana nostri villa, Basse, Faustini,</L>
<L>Non otiosis ordinata myrtetis,</L>
<L>Viduaque platano, tonsilique buxeto,</L>

</LG>
<P>There is certainly something in the amiable simplicity of unadorned Nature, that spreads over the mind a more noble sort of tranquillity, and a loftier sensation of pleasure, than can be raised from the nicer scenes of art.</P>
<P>This was the taste of the Ancients in their gar∣dens, as we may discover from the descriptions extant of them. The two most celebrated wits of the world have each of them left us a particular picture of a Garden; wherein those great masters being wholly unconfined, and painting at pleasure, may be thought to have given a full idea of what they esteemed most excellent in this way. These (one may observe) consist intirely of the useful part of horticulture, fruit trees, herbs, water, etc. The pieces I am speaking of are Virgil's account of the garden of the old Corycian, and Homer's of that

<P>Sir William Temple has remarked, that this garden of Homer contains all the justest rules and provisions which can go toward composing the best gardens. Its extent was four Acres, which, in those times of simplicity, was looked upon as a large one, even for a Prince. It was inclosed all round for defence; and for conveniency joined close to the gates of the Palace.</P>
<P>He mentions next the Trees, which were stand∣ards, and suffered to grow to their full height. The fine description of the Fruits that never failed, and the eternal Zephyrs, is only a more noble and poetical way of expressing the continual suc∣cession of one fruit after another throughout the year.</P>
<P>The Vineyard seems to have been a plantation distinct from the Garden; as also the beds of Greens mentioned afterwards at the extremity of the inclosure, in the usual place of our Kitchen Gardens.</P>
<P>The two Fountains are disposed very remark∣ably. They rose within the inclosure, and were brought in by conduits or ducts; one of them to water all parts of the gardens, and the other un∣derneath the Palace into the Town, for the ser∣vice of the publick.</P>
<P>How contrary to this simplicity is the modern practice of gardening? We seem to make it our
<PB N="354" REF="359"/>
study to recede from Nature, not only in the va∣rious tonsure of greens into the most regular and formal shapes, but even in monstrous attempts be∣yond the reach of the art itself: we run into scul∣pture, and are yet better pleased to have our Trees in the most aukward figures of men and animals, than in the most regular of their own.</P>

<P>I believe it is no wrong observation, that per∣sons of genius, and those who are most capable of art, are always most fond of nature; as such are chiefly sensible, that all art consists in the imitation and study of nature: On the contrary, people of the common level of understanding are principally delighted with the little niceties and fantastical operations of art, and constantly think that finest which is least natural. A Citizen is no sooner proprietor of a couple of Yews, but he entertains thoughts of erecting them into Giants, like those of Guildhall.

<HEAD>PREFACE TO HOMER'S ILIAD.</HEAD>
<P>HOMER is universally allowed to have had the greatest <HI>Invention</HI> of any writer what∣ever. The praise of Judgment Virgil has justly contested with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellencies; but his Invention remains yet unrival'd. Nor is it a won∣der if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great Genius's: The utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which master every thing besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes Art with all her materials, and without it, Judgment itself can at best but <HI>steal wisely:</HI> For Art is only like a pru∣dent steward that lives on managing the riches of Nature. Whatever praises may be given to works of Judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them, to which the Invention must not contri∣bute. As in the most regular gardens, Art can
<PB N="358" REF="363"/>
only reduce the beauties of Nature to more regu∣larity, and such a figure, which the common eye may better take in, and is therefore more enter∣tained with. And perhaps the reason why com∣mon Criticks are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through an uniform and bound∣ed walk of Art, than to comprehend the vast and various extent of Nature.</P>
<P>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater. 'Tis like a copious nur∣sery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants, each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things are too luxuriant, it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because they are over-run and opprest by those of a stronger na∣ture.</P>
<P>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequal'd fire and rapture, which is so forcible in Homer, that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him. What he writes, is of the most ani∣mated nature imaginable; every thing moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a coun∣cil
<PB N="359" REF="364"/>
be called, or a battle fought, you are not cold∣ly informed of what was said or done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the Poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes,
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></L></Q>
<HI>They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it.</HI> 'Tis however remarkable that his fancy, which is every where vigorous, is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendor: It grows in the progress both up∣on himself and others, and becomes on fire like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity. Exact dis∣position, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers, may have been found in a thousand; but this poetical fire, this <HI>Vivida vis animi,</HI> in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected, this can over-power criticism, and make us admire even while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with absurdi∣ties, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing but its own splendor. This <HI>Fire</HI> is discerned in Virgil, but discerned as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but every where equal and constant: In Lucan and Statius, it bursts out in sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a
<PB N="360" REF="365"/>
furnace kept up to an uncommon ardor by the force of art: In Shakespear, it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from heaven: But in Homer, and in him only, it burns every where clearly, and every where irresistibly.</P>
<P>I shall here endeavour to show, how this vast <HI>Invention</HI> exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet, through all the main constituent parts of his work, as it is the great and peculiar charac∣teristic which distinguishes him from all other au∣thors.</P>
<P>This strong and ruling faculty was like a pow∣erful star, which in the violence of its course, drew all things within its <HI>vortex.</HI> It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his charac∣ters; and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions; but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination, and crea∣ted a world for himself in the invention of <HI>Fable.</HI> That which Aristotle calls the <HI>Soul of poetry,</HI> was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with considering him in this part, as it is naturally the first, and I speak of it both as it means the de∣sign of a poem, and as it is taken for fiction.</P>
<P>Fable may be divided into the <HI>probable,</HI> the <HI>al∣legorical,</HI> and the <HI>marvellous.</HI> The <HI>probable fable</HI>
<PB N="361" REF="366"/>
is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of na∣ture: Or of such as though they did, become fa∣bles by the additional episodes and manner of tell∣ing them. Of this sort is the main story of an Epic poem, <HI>the return of</HI> Ulysses, <HI>the settlement of the</HI> Trojans <HI>in</HI> Italy, or the like. That of the <HI>Iliad</HI> is the <HI>anger of</HI> Achilles, the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any Poet. Yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and crouded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irre∣gularity. The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer's poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The other Epic Poets have used the same practice, but generally carry'd it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of action, and lose their readers in an unrea∣sonable length of time. Nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his in∣vention, but they have followed him in every epi∣sode and part of story. If he has given a regular <HI>catalogue</HI> of an <HI>army,</HI> they all draw up their forces
<PB N="362" REF="367"/>
in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus, Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them) destroys the unity of his action for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses visit the shades, the Aeneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso, so is Aeneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem, Rinaldo must ab∣sent himself just as long, on the like account. If he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close imitation of Ho∣mer, but where he had not led the way, supplied the want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon and the taking of Troy was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from Pi∣sander, as the Loves of Dido and Aeneas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</P>
<P>To proceed to the <HI>allegorical fable:</HI> If we re∣flect upon those innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy, which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapp'd up in his <HI>allegories,</HI> what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us? How fer∣tile will that imagination appear, which was able to clothe all the properties of elements, the qua∣lifications of the mind, the virtues and vices, in
<PB N="363" REF="368"/>
forms and persons; and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed? This is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer; and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for their invention in hav∣ing enlarged his circle, but for their judgment in having contracted it. For when the mode of learn∣ing changed in following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner; it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it was in Homer to make use of it. And per∣haps it was no unhappy circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention, as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem.</P>
<P>The <HI>marvellous fable</HI> includes whatever is super∣natural, and especially the machines of the Gods. He seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity. For we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the Gods, constantly laying their accu∣sation against Homer as the chief support of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his <HI>machines</HI> in a philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic, that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: None have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry be∣yond the limits he has set: Every attempt of this
<PB N="364" REF="369"/>
nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the various changes of times and religions, his Gods continue to this day the Gods of poetry.</P>
<P>We come now to the <HI>characters</HI> of his persons: And here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprizing a variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them. Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features, than the Poet has by their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single quality of <HI>courage</HI> is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and in∣tractable; that of Diomede forward, yet listening to advice and subject to command: That of Ajax is heavy, and self-confiding; of Hector active and vigilant: The courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition, that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: We find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier, in Sar∣pedon a gallant and generous one. Nor is this ju∣dicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character, but even in the underparts of it, to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one. For example, the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in <HI>wisdom;</HI> and they are distinct in this, that the wisdom of one is <HI>arti∣ficial</HI>
<PB N="365" REF="370"/>
and <HI>various,</HI> of the other <HI>natural, open,</HI> and <HI>regular.</HI> But they have, besides, characters of <HI>courage;</HI> and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence: for one in the war depends still upon <HI>caution,</HI> the other upon <HI>experience.</HI> It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds. The characters of Vir∣gil are far from striking us in this open manner; they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguish∣ed, and where they are marked most evidently, affect us not in proportion to those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a su∣perior degree; and we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of Statius's heroes, that an air of impe∣tuosity runs thro' them all; the same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus, Hippomedon, etc. They have a parity of cha∣racter, which makes them seem brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this track of reflection, if he will pursue it thro' the <HI>Epic</HI> and <HI>Tragic</HI> writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of Homer was to that of all others.</P>
<P>The <HI>speeches</HI> are to be considered as they flow from the characters, being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those
<PB N="366" REF="371"/>
who utter them. As there is more variety of cha∣racters in the <HI>Iliad,</HI> so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. <HI>Every thing in it has man∣ners</HI> (as Aristotle expresses it) that is, every thing is acted or spoken. It is hardly credible in a work of such length, how small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative; and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be equally just in any per∣son's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of his persons have no apparent characters, so ma∣ny of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftner think of the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in Homer: All which are the ef∣fects of a colder invention, that interests us less in the action described: Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil leaves us readers.</P>
<P>If in the next place we take a view of the <HI>senti∣ments,</HI> the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part Ho∣mer principally excelled. What were alone suf∣ficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they have so re∣markable a parity with those of the Scripture: Du∣port, in his Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort. And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if
<PB N="367" REF="372"/>
Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the <HI>Iliad.</HI></P>
<P>If we observe his <HI>descriptions, images,</HI> and <HI>si∣miles,</HI> we shall find the invention still predomi∣nant. To what else can we ascribe that vast com∣prehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance of art, and individual of nature summoned together, by the extent and fecundity of his imagination; to which all things, in their various views, presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full pros∣pects of things, but several unexpected peculiari∣ties and side-views, unobserved by any Painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as the descrip∣tions of his battels, which take up no less than half the <HI>Iliad,</HI> and are supplied with so vast a va∣riety of incidents, that no one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner; and such a profusion of noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness, horror, and con∣fusion. It is certain there is not near that num∣ber of images and descriptions in any Epic Poet; though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him: And it is evident of Virgil
<PB N="368" REF="373"/>
especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master.</P>
<P>If we descend from hence to the <HI>expression,</HI> we see the bright imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction, the first who taught that <HI>language of the Gods</HI> to men. His ex∣pression is like the colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on boldly, and exe∣cuted with rapidity. It is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit. Aristotle had reason to say, He was the only poet who had found out <HI>living words;</HI> there are in him more daring figures and meta∣phors than in any good author whatever. An ar∣row is <HI>impatient</HI> to be on the wing, a weapon <HI>thirsts</HI> to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like. Yet his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in proportion to it. 'Tis the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it: And in the same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter; as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous: Like glass in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the heat more intense.</P>
<P>To throw his language more out of prose, Ho∣mer seems to have affected the <HI>compound epithets.</HI>
<PB N="369" REF="374"/>
This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry, not only as it heighten'd the <HI>diction,</HI> but as it assisted and filled the <HI>numbers</HI> with great∣er sound and pomp, and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the <HI>images.</HI> On this last con∣sideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention, since (as he has ma∣naged them) they are a sort of supernumerary pic∣tures of the persons or things to which they are joined. We see the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the landscape of mount Neritus in that of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and so of others, which particular images could not have been in∣sisted upon so long as to express them in a descrip∣tion (tho' but of a single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure. As a Metaphor is a short simile, one of these Epithets is a short description.</P>
<P>Lastly, if we consider his <HI>versification,</HI> we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his in∣vention in that. He was not satisfy'd with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece, but search'd thro' its differing <HI>dialects</HI> with this particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers: He consider'd these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and according∣ly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the <HI>Ionic,</HI> which has a peculiar sweet∣ness from its never using contractions, and from
<PB N="370" REF="375"/>
its custom of resolving the dipthongs into two syl∣lables: so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency. With this he mingled the <HI>Attic</HI> contractions, the broader <HI>Doric,</HI> and the feebler <HI>Aeolic,</HI> which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its accent; and compleat∣ed this variety by altering some letters with the li∣cence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all these he has derived that harmony, which makes us confess he had not on∣ly the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses, even without under∣standing them (with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian Operas) will find more sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language or poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the criticks to be copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just to ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: Indeed the Greek has some ad∣vantages both from the natural <HI>sound</HI> of its <HI>words,</HI> and the turn and <HI>cadence</HI> of its <HI>verse,</HI> which agree with the genius of no other language. Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to
<PB N="371" REF="376"/>
whatsoever graces it was capable of; and in parti∣cular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Gre∣cian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the only reason is, that fewer criticks have understood one language than the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our author's beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the <HI>Composition of Words,</HI> and others will be taken notice of in the course of my Notes. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the <HI>Muses</HI> dictated; and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plenti∣ful river, always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imagin∣able.</P>
<P>Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us is his <HI>invention.</HI> It is that which forms the character of each part of his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more <HI>extensive</HI> and <HI>copious</HI> than any other, his manners more <HI>lively</HI> and <HI>strongly marked,</HI> his speeches more <HI>affecting</HI> and <HI>transported,</HI> his senti∣ments more <HI>warm</HI> and <HI>sublime,</HI> his images and de∣scriptions more <HI>full</HI> and <HI>animated,</HI> his expression
<PB N="372" REF="377"/>
more <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>daring,</HI> and his numbers more <HI>ra∣pid</HI> and <HI>various.</HI> I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his character. No∣thing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an op∣position of particular passages in them, and form∣ing a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain know∣ledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each: It is in <HI>that</HI> we are to consider him, and in proportion to his degree in <HI>that</HI> we are to admire him. No author or man ever ex∣celled all the world in more than one faculty; and as Homer has done this in <HI>invention,</HI> Virgil has in <HI>judgment.</HI> Not that we are to think Homer want∣ed judgment, because Virgil had it in a more emi∣nent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, be∣cause Homer possest a larger share of it: Each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work. Ho∣mer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity. Virgil leads us with an attractive ma∣jesty: Homer scatters with a generous profusion, Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence: Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a bound∣less overflow; Virgil, like a river in its banks, with
<PB N="373" REF="378"/>
a gentle and constant stream. When we behold their battles, methinks the two Poets resemble the Heroes they celebrate: Homer, boundless and ir∣resistible as Achilles, bears all before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Vir∣gil, calmly daring like Aeneas, appears undisturb∣ed in the midst of the action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the Heavens; Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling with the Gods, laying plans for em∣pires, and regularly ordering his whole creation.</P>
<P>But after all, it is with great parts as with great virtues, they naturally border on some imperfec∣tion; and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment decline to coldness; and as mag∣nanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief <HI>objections</HI> against him to pro∣ceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this fa∣culty.</P>
<P>Among these we may reckon some of his <HI>mar∣vellous fictions,</HI> upon which so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of proba∣bility. Perhaps it may be with great and superior
<PB N="374" REF="379"/>
souls, as with gigantick bodies, which exerting themselves with unusual strength, exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become miracles in the whole; and like the old heroes of that make, commit something near ex∣travagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimit∣able performances. Thus Homer has his <HI>speaking horses,</HI> and Virgil his <HI>myrtles distilling blood,</HI> where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a Deity to save the probability.</P>
<P>It is owing to the same vast invention, that his <HI>Similes</HI> have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded: It runs out into embel∣lishments of additional images, which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his manner of heaping a number of compari∣sons together in one breath, when his fancy sug∣gested to him at once so many various and corres∣pondent images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind.</P>
<P>If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius, than
<PB N="375" REF="380"/>
an excess of it; those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the na∣ture of the times he lived in. Such are his <HI>gros∣ser representations</HI> of the <HI>Gods,</HI> and the vicious and <HI>imperfect manners</HI> of his <HI>Heroes,</HI> which will be treated of in the following <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Articles of Theology and Morality, in the third part of the Essay.</NOTE><HI>Essay:</HI> But I must here speak a word of the latter, as it is a point general∣ly carried into extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madam Da∣cier, <Q>“that <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Preface to her Homer.</NOTE>those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours.”</Q> Who can be so prejudiced in their fa∣vour as to magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reign'd thro' the world; when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre, when the greatest Princes were put to the sword, and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be so delicate as those modern criticks, who are shocked at the <HI>servile offices</HI> and mean employ∣ments in which we sometimes see the Heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages, in beholding Monarchs with∣out their guards, Princes tending their flocks, and
<PB N="376" REF="381"/>
Princesses drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest Antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things no where else to be found, the only true mirrour of that ancient world. By this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usu∣ally creates their dislike, will become a satisfac∣tion.</P>
<P>This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same <HI>epithets</HI> to his Gods and Heroes, such as the <HI>far-darting</HI> Phoebus, the <HI>blue-ey'd</HI> Pallas, the <HI>swift-footed</HI> Achilles, etc. which some have censured as impertinent and te∣diously repeated. Those of the Gods depended upon the powers and offices then believ'd to be∣long to them, and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of attri∣butes with which it was a matter of religion to sa∣lute them on all occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature of <HI>Surnames,</HI> and repeated as such;
<PB N="377" REF="382"/>
for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinc∣tion of each person; either naming his parents expresly, or his place of birth, profession, or the like: As Alexander the son of Philip, Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, etc. Ho∣mer therefore complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry. And indeed we have some∣thing parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Ed∣ward Long-shanks, Edward the Black Prince, etc. If yet this be thought to account better for the pro∣priety than for the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one, of <HI>Heroes distinct from other men, a divine race, who fought at</HI> Thebes <HI>and</HI> Troy, <HI>are called Demi-Gods, and live by the care of</HI> Jupiter <HI>in the islands of the blessed</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Hesiod, Op. et Dier. lib. i. ℣ 155, etc.</NOTE>. Now among the divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in common with the Gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by its celebrating their families, actions, or qualities.</P>
<P>What other cavils have been raised against Ho∣mer, are such as hardly deserve a reply, but will
<PB N="378" REF="383"/>
yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: One would imagine by the whole course of their parallels, that these Criticks never so much as heard of Homer's having written first; a conside∣ration which whoever compares these two Poets, ought to have always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and moral of the Aeneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the Aeneis: as that the Hero is a wiser man; and the action of the one more beneficial to his coun∣try than that of the other: Or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as Aeneas, when the very moral of his poem requir∣ed a contrary character: It is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil. Others select those particular passages of Homer, which are not so laboured as some that Virgil drew out of them: This is the whole management of Scaliger in his Poetice. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions, sometimes thro' a false delicacy and refinement, oftner from an ignorance of the graces of the original; and then triumph in the aukwardness of their own
<PB N="379" REF="384"/>
translations: This is the conduct of Perault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretend∣ing to a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer, and that of his <HI>work;</HI> but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of those that followed: And in pursuance of this principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of the cities, etc.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author, whose general cha∣racter will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Motte; who yet confesses upon the whole, that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in this sense to be the master even of those who surpass'd him.</P>
<P>In all these objections we see nothing that con∣tradicts his title to the honour of the chief <HI>Inven∣tion;</HI> and as long as this (which is indeed the cha∣racteristic of Poetry itself) remains unequal'd by his followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of <HI>one sort</HI> of Criticks: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most universal applauses, which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment.
<PB N="380" REF="385"/>
Homer not only appears the Inventor of poetry, but excells all the inventors of other arts in this, that he has swallow'd up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regu∣lation. He shewed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in some of his flights, it was but because he attempted every thing. A work of this kind seems like a mighty Tree which rises from the most vigorous seed, is improved with in∣dustry, flourishes, and produces the finest fruit; nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have only said, that a few branches (which run luxuriant thro' a richness of nature) might be lopp'd into form to give it a more regu∣lar appearance.</P>
<P>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it remains to treat of the transla∣tion, with the same view to the chief characteris∣tic. As far as <HI>that</HI> is seen in the main parts of the Poem, such as the fable, manners, and senti∣ments, no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in every particular image, description, and simile; whoever lessens or too much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and un∣maim'd; and for the rest, the diction and versifi∣cation
<PB N="381" REF="386"/>
only are his proper province; since these must be his own, but the others he is to take as he finds them.</P>
<P>It should then be consider'd what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no lite∣ral translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that a rash para∣phrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but those which are necessary for transfusing the spirit of the origi∣nal, and supporting the poetical style of the transla∣tion: And I will venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author. It is not to be doubted that the <HI>fire</HI> of the poem is what a translator should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his managing: However, it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is, in any particular place. 'Tis a great secret in writing to know when to be plain,
<PB N="382" REF="387"/>
and when poetical and figurative; and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow mo∣destly in his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to be deterr'd from imitating him by the fear of in∣curring the censure of a mere English Critick. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: Some of his translators having swelled into sustian in a proud confidence of the <HI>sublime;</HI> others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous no∣tion of <HI>simplicity.</HI> Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the certain signs of false mettle) others slowly and servilely creeping in his train, while the Poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two ex∣treams one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigi∣dity: No author is to be envied for such commen∣dations as he may gain by that character of style, which his friends must agree together to call <HI>sim∣plicity,</HI> and the rest of the world will call <HI>dulness.</HI> There is a graceful and dignify'd simplicity, as well as a bald and sordid one, which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven: 'Tis one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all. Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="388"/>
This pure and noble simplicity is no where in such perfection as in the <HI>Scripture</HI> and our Author. One may affirm, with all respect to the inspired writings, that the <HI>divine Spirit</HI> made use of no other words but what were intelligible and com∣mon to men at that time, and in that part of the world; and as Homer is the author nearest to those, his style must of course bear a greater re∣semblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may methinks induce a translator on the one hand, to give into several of those general phrases and manners of expression, which have at∣tain'd a veneration even in our language from be∣ing used in the Old Testament; as on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity, and in a manner consign'd to mystery and religion.</P>
<P>For a further preservation of this air of simpli∣city, a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those <HI>moral sentences</HI> and <HI>prover∣bial speeches</HI> which are so numerous in this Poet. They have something venerable, and as I may say oracular, in that unadorn'd gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</P>
<P><PB N="384" REF="389"/>
Perhaps the mixture of some Grecisms and old words after the manner of Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast. But certainly the use of modern terms of war and government, such as <HI>platoon, campagne, junto,</HI> or the like (into which some of his tran∣slators have fallen) cannot be allowable; those only excepted, without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language.</P>
<P>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction which are a sort of <HI>marks</HI> or <HI>moles,</HI> by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight: Those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects; and those who are, seem pleased with them as beauties. I speak of his <HI>compound epithets,</HI> and of his <HI>repetitions.</HI> Many of the former can∣not be done literally into English without destroy∣ing the purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition; as well as those which have received a sanction from the au∣thority of our best Poets, and are become fami∣liar thro' their use of them; such as the <HI>cloud-com∣pelling</HI> Jove, etc. As for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and significantly exprest in a single word as in a compounded one, the course to be taken is obvious.</P>
<P><PB N="385" REF="390"/>
Some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the epi∣thet <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to a mountain, would appear lit∣tle or ridiculous translated literally <HI>leaf-shaking,</HI> but affords a majestic idea in the <HI>periphrasis: The lofty mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntain shakes his waving woods.</HI> Others that ad∣mit of differing significations, may receive an ad∣vantage by a judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are introduced. For ex∣ample, the epithet of Apollo, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>far∣shooting,</HI> is capable of two explications; one lite∣ral in respect of the darts and bow, the ensign of that God; the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun: Therefore in such places where Apollo is represented as a God in person, I would use the former interpretation; and where the ef∣fects of the sun are described, I would make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be neces∣sary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in Homer, and which, tho' it might be accommodated (as has been already shewn) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: But one may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are em∣ploy'd; and in doing this properly, a translator may at once shew his fancy and his judgment.</P>
<P>As for Homer's <HI>Repetitions,</HI> we may divide them into three sorts, of whole narrations and speeches,
<PB N="386" REF="391"/>
of single sentences, and of one verse or hemistich. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these, as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not un∣graceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from Gods to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the repetitions are placed in the original: When they follow too close, one may vary the ex∣pression, but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any: If they be tedious, the author is to answer for it.</P>
<P>It only remains to speak of the <HI>Versification.</HI> Homer (as has been said) is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every new subject. This is indeed one of the most ex∣quisite beauties of poetry, and attainable by very few: I know only of Homer eminent for it in the Greek, and Virgil in Latin. I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possest of his image: however it may be reasonably believed they design∣ed this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others. Few readers have
<PB N="387" REF="392"/>
the ear to be judges of it; but those who have, will see I have endeavour'd at this beauty.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may en∣tertain without much vanity, of giving a more to∣lerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those of Chap∣man, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce any para∣phrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent interpolations of four or six lines, and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ℣ 312. where he has spun twenty verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one might think he deviated on pur∣pose, if he did not in other places of his notes in∣sist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author, insomuch as to pro∣mise in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mys∣teries he had revealed in Homer: and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian, a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, etc. In a word, the nature of the man may account for his whole performance; for he appears from his pre∣face and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn,
<PB N="388" REF="393"/>
and an enthusiast in poetry. His own boast of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen weeks, shews with what negligence his version was performed. But that which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover his de∣fects, is a daring firey spirit that animates his trans∣lation, which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion.</P>
<P>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general, but for particulars and circum∣stances he continually lops them, and often omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it, which pro∣ceeds not from his following the original line by line, but from the contractions above-mentioned. He sometimes omits whole similes and sentences, and is now and then guilty of mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but thro' carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogil∣by's, is too mean for criticism.</P>
<P>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he
<PB N="389" REF="394"/>
sometimes copies, and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil, his version of whom (notwithstand∣ing some human errors) is the most noble and spi∣rited translation I know in any language. But the fate of great genius's is like that of great ministers, tho' they are confessedly the first in the common∣wealth of letters, they must be envy'd and calum∣niated only for being at the head of it.</P>
<P>That which in my opinion ought to be the en∣deavour of any one who translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character: In particular places, where the sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve, in the more active or de∣scriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a fullness and perspicuity; in the sen∣tences, a shortness and gravity: Not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of anti∣quity: Perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass, than has hitherto been done by any translator, who has tolerably preserved ei∣ther
<PB N="390" REF="395"/>
the sense or poetry. What I would further recommend to him, is to study his author rather from his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the ancients, and with Milton above all the mo∣derns. Next these, the Archbishop of Cambr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y's Telemachus may give him th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author, and Boss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s admira∣ble treatise of the Epic poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all, with what∣ever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few; those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and com∣petent learning. For to satisfy such as want ei∣ther, is not in the nature of this undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not <HI>modern,</HI> and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</P>
<P>What I have done is submitted to the publick, from whose opinions I am prepared to learn; tho' I fear no judges so little as our best poets, who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst, whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation
<PB N="391" REF="396"/>
be true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task, who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms, as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my un∣dertaking to the publick. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well as sincere criticisms of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe and Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last, whose good-nature (to give it a great panegyrick) is no less extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But what can I say of the honour so many of the <HI>Great</HI> have done me, while the <HI>first names</HI> of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers. Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find, that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of Poet: That his Grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased
<PB N="392" REF="397"/>
should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his excellent <HI>Essay)</HI> so complete a Praise.</P>
<LG>
<L>Read <HI>Homer once,</HI> and you can read no more;</L>
<L>For all Books else appear so mean, so poor,</L>
<L>Verse will seem Prose: but still persist to read,</L>
<L>And <HI>Homer</HI> will be all the Books you need.</L>
</LG>
<P>That the Earl of Hallifax was one of the first to favour me, of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example. That such a Genius as my Lord Bolingbroke, not more di∣stinguished in the great scenes of business, than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not refused to be the critick of these sheets, and the patron of their writer. And that the no∣ble author of the Tragedy of <HI>Heroic Love,</HI> has continued his partiality to me, from my writing Pastorals, to my attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing, that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general, but their correction of several particulars of this translation.</P>
<P>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the Earl of Carnarvon, but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous ac∣tion in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them. Mr. Stanhope, the present Se∣cretary of State, will pardon my desire of hav∣ing
<PB N="393" REF="398"/>
it known that he was pleased to promote this affair. The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friend∣ship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends, to whom all acknow∣ledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privi∣leges of a familiar correspondence: And I am sa∣tisfy'd I can no way better oblige men of their turn, than by my silence.</P>
<P>In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens, that has been shewn me by its learned rival, the Uni∣versity of Oxford. And I can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agree∣able obligations, and easy friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is the more to be acknowledged, as it is shewn to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular <HI>parties,</HI> or the vanities of particular <HI>men.</HI> Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the can∣dour and friendship of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE Works of SHAKESPEAR.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not my design to enter into a criticism upon this author; tho' to do it effectually and not superficially, would be the best occasion that any just writer could take, to form the judgment and taste of our nation. For of all English poets Shakespear must be confessed to be the fairest and fullest subject for criticism, and to afford the most numerous, as well as most conspicuous instances, both of beauties and faults of all sorts. But this far exceeds the bounds of a Preface, the business of which is only to give an account of the fate of his works, and the disadvantages under which they have been transmitted to us. We shall here∣by extenuate many faults which are his, and clear him from the imputation of many which are not: A design, which though it can be no guide to future criticks to do him justice in one way, will at least be sufficient to prevent their doing him an injustice in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="400"/>
I cannot however but mention some of his prin∣cipal and characteristic excellencies, for which (notwithstanding his defects) he is justly and uni∣versally elevated above all other dramatick Writers. Not that this is the proper place of praising him, but because I would not omit any occasion of doing it.</P>
<P>If ever any author deserved the name of an <HI>Ori∣ginal,</HI> it was Shakespear. Homer himself drew not his art so immediately from the fountains of Nature; it proceeded thro' Aegyptian strainers and channels, and came to him not without some tincture of the learning, or some cast of the mo∣dels, of those before him. The poetry of Shake∣spear was inspiration indeed: he is not so much an Imitator, as an Instrument, of Nature; and 'tis not so just to say that he speaks from her, as that she speaks thro' him.</P>
<P>His <HI>Characters</HI> are so much Nature herself, that 'tis a sort of injury to call them by so distant a name as copies of her. Those of other Poets have a constant resemblance, which shews that they received them from one another, and were but multipliers of the same image: each picture like a mock-rainbow is but the reflexion of a re∣flexion. But every single character in Shakespear is as much an individual, as those in life itself; it is as impossible to find any two alike; and such as from their relation or affinity in any respect ap∣pear most to be twins, will upon comparison be found remarkably distinct. To this life and va∣riety
<PB N="396" REF="401"/>
of character, we must add the wonderful pre∣servation of it; which is such throughout his Plays, that, had all the speeches been printed without the very names of the persons, I believe one might have applied them with certainty to every speaker.</P>
<P>The <HI>Power</HI> over our <HI>Passions</HI> was never possess'd in a more eminent degree, or displayed in so dif∣ferent instances. Yet all along, there is seen no labour, no pains to raise them; no preparation to guide our guess to the effect, or be perceiv'd to lead toward it: But the heart swells, and the tears burst out, just at the proper places: We are surprized the moment we weep; and yet upon re∣flection find the passion so just, that we should be surprized if we had not wept, and wept at that very moment.</P>
<P>How astonishing is it again, that the Passions directly opposite to these, Laughter and Spleen, are no less at his command! that he is not more a master of the <HI>great</HI> than of the <HI>ridiculous</HI> in hu∣man nature; of our noblest tendernesses, than of our vainest foibles; of our strongest emotions, than of our idlest sensations!</P>
<P>Nor does he only excel in the Passions: in the coolness of Reflection and Reasoning he is full as admirable. His <HI>Sentiments</HI> are not only in gene∣ral the most pertinent and judicious upon every subject; but by a talent very peculiar, something between penetration and felicity, he hits upon that particular point on which the bent of each argu∣ment
<PB N="397" REF="402"/>
turns, or the force of each motive depends. This is perfectly amazing, from a man of no edu∣cation or experience in those great and publick scenes of life which are usually the subject of his thoughts: So that he seems to have known the world by intuition, to have looked thro' human nature at one glance, and to be the only author that gives ground for a very new opinion, That the philosopher and even the man of the world, may be <HI>born,</HI> as well as the poet.</P>
<P>It must be owned that with all these great ex∣cellencies, he has almost as great defects; and that as he has certainly written better, so he has per∣haps written worse, than any other. But I think I can in some measure account for these defects, from several causes and accidents; without which it is hard to imagine that so large and so enlight∣ened a mind could ever have been susceptible of them. That all these contingencies should unite to his disadvantage seems to me almost as singularly unlucky, as that so many various (nay contrary) talents should meet in one man, was happy and extraordinary.</P>
<P>It must be allowed that Stage-poetry of all other, is more particularly levelled to please the <HI>populace,</HI> and its success more immediately depend∣ing upon the <HI>common suffrage.</HI> One cannot there∣fore wonder, if Shakespear, having at his first ap∣pearance no other aim in his writings than to pro∣cure a subsistence, directed his endeavours solely
<PB N="398" REF="403"/>
to hit the taste and humour that then prevailed. The audience was generally composed of the meaner sort of people; and therefore the images of life were to be drawn from those of their own rank: accordingly we find, that not our author's only, but almost all the old comedies have their scene among <HI>Tradesmen</HI> and <HI>Mechanicks:</HI> And even their historical plays stricly follow the common <HI>old stories</HI> or <HI>vulgar traditions</HI> of that kind of peo∣ple. In Tragedy, nothing was so sure to <HI>surprize</HI> and cause <HI>admiration,</HI> as the most strange, unex∣pected, and consequently most unnatural, events and incidents; the most exaggerated thoughts; the most verbose and bombast expression; the most pompous rhymes, and thundering versification. In Comedy, nothing was so sure to <HI>please,</HI> as mean buffoonry, vile ribaldry, and unmannerly jests of fools and clowns. Yet even in these, our author's wit buoys up, and is born above his subject: his genius in those low parts is like some prince of a romance in the disguise of a shepherd or peasant; a certain greatness and spirit now and then break out, which manifest his higher extraction and qualities.</P>
<P>It may be added, that not only the common audience had no notion of the rules of writing, but few even of the better sort piqued themselves upon any great degree of knowledge or nicety that way; 'till Ben Johnson, getting possession of the
<PB N="399" REF="404"/>
stage, brought critical learning into vogue: And that this was not done without difficulty, may ap∣pear from those frequent lessons (and indeed al∣most declamations) which he was forced to prefix to his first plays, and put into the mouth of his actors, the <HI>Grex, Chorus,</HI> etc. to remove the pre∣judices, and inform the judgment of his hearers. 'Till then, our authors had no thoughts of writ∣ing on the model of the ancients: their Tragedies were only histories in dialogue; and their come∣dies followed the thread of any novel as they found it, no less implicitly than if it had been true his∣tory.</P>
<P>To judge therefore of Shakespear by Aristotle's rules, is like trying a man by the laws of one country, who acted under those of another. He writ to the <HI>people;</HI> and writ at first without patro∣nage from the better sort, and therefore without aims of pleasing them: without assistance or ad∣vice from the learned, as without the advantage of education or acquaintance among them: with∣out that knowledge of the best models, the anci∣ents, to inspire him with an emulation of them: in a word, without any views of reputation, and of what poets are pleased to call immortality: Some or all of which have encouraged the vanity, or ani∣mated the ambition, of other writers.</P>
<P>Yet it must be observed, that when his perfor∣mances had merited the protection of his prince, and when the encouragement of the court had suc∣ceeded
<PB N="400" REF="405"/>
to that of the town; the works of his ri∣per years are manifestly raised above those of his former. The dates of his plays sufficiently evi∣dence that his productions improved, in propor∣tion to the respect he had for his auditors. And I make no doubt this observation would be found true in every instance, were but editions extant from which we might learn the exact time when every piece was composed, and whether writ for the town, or the court.</P>
<P>Another cause (and no less strong than the former) may be deduced from our Author's being a <HI>player,</HI> and forming himself first upon the judg∣ments of that body of men whereof he was a mem∣ber. They have ever had a standard to themselves, upon other principles than those of Aristotle. As they live by the majority, they know no rule but that of pleasing the present humour, and comply∣ing with the wit in fashion; a consideration which brings all their judgment to a short point. Players are just such judges of what is <HI>right,</HI> as taylors are of what is <HI>graceful.</HI> And in this view it will be but fair to allow, that most of our Author's faults are less to be ascribed to his wrong judgment as a Poet, than to his right judgment as a Player.</P>
<P>By these men it was thought a praise to Shake∣spear, that he scarce ever <HI>blotted a line.</HI> This they industriously propagated, as appears from what we are told by Ben Johnson in his <HI>Discoveries,</HI> and from the preface of Heminges and Condell to the
<PB N="401" REF="406"/>
first folio edition. But in reality (however it has prevailed) there never was a more groundless re∣port, or to the contrary of which there are more undeniable evidences. As the Comedy of the <HI>Merry Wives of Windsor,</HI> which he entirely new writ; the <HI>History of Henry</HI> VI. which was first published under the title of <HI>the Contention of York and Lancaster:</HI> and that of <HI>Henry</HI> V. extreme∣ly improved; that of <HI>Hamlet</HI> enlarged to almost as much again as at first, and many others. I be∣lieve the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground. This too might be thought a praise by some, and to this his er∣rors have as injudiciously been ascribed by others. For tis certain, were it true, it could concern but a small part of them; the most are such as are not properly defects, but superfoetations; and arise not from want of learning or reading, but from want of thinking or judging: or rather (to be more just to our Author) from a compliance to those wants in others. As to a wrong choice of the subject, a wrong conduct of the incidents, false thoughts, forced expressions, etc. if these are not to be ascribed to the foresaid accidental rea∣sons, they must be charged upon the poet himself, and there is no help for it. But I think the two disadvantages which I have mentioned (to be oblig∣ed to please the lowest of people, and to keep the worst of company) if the consideration be extend∣ed as far as it reasonably may, will appear suffici∣ent
<PB N="402" REF="407"/>
to mislead and depress the greatest Genius up∣on earth. Nay the more modesty with which such a one is endued, the more he is in danger of submitting and conforming to others, against his own better judgment.</P>
<P>But as to his <HI>want of learning,</HI> it may be neces∣sary to say something more: There is certainly a vast difference between <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>languages.</HI> How far he was ignorant of the latter, I cannot determine; but 'tis plain he had much reading at least, if they will not call it learning, Nor is it any great matter, if a man has knowledge, whe∣ther he has it from one language or from another. Nothing is more evident than that he had a taste of natural philosophy, mechanicks, ancient and modern history, poetical learning and mythology: We find him very knowing in the customs, rites, and manners of antiquity. In <HI>Coriolanus</HI> and <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> not only the spirit, but manners, of the Romans are exactly drawn; and still a nicer distinction is shown, between the manners of the Romans in the time of the former, and of the lat∣ter. His reading in the ancient historians is no less conspicuous, in many references to particular passages: and the speeches copied from Plutarch in <HI>Coriolanus</HI> may, I think, as well be made an instance of his learning, as those copied from Ci∣cero in <HI>Catiline,</HI> of Ben Johnson's. The manners of other nations in general, the Egyptians, Vene∣tains, French, etc. are drawn with equal propriety.
<PB N="403" REF="408"/>
Whatever object of nature, or branch of science, he either speaks of or describes; it is always with competent, if not extensive knowledge: his de∣scriptions are still exact; all his metaphors appro∣priated, and remarkably drawn from the true na∣ture and inherent qualities of each subject. When he treats of ethic or politic, we may constantly observe a wonderful justness of distinction, as well as extent of comprehension. No one is more a master of the poetical story, or has more frequent allusions to the various parts of it: Mr. Waller (who has been celebrated for this last particular) has not shewn more learning this way than Shake∣spear. We have translations from Ovid published in his name, among those poems which pass for his, and for some of which we have undoubted authority (being published by himself, and dedi∣cated to his noble patron the Earl of Southampton:) He appears also to have been conversant in Plautus, from whom he has taken the plot of one of his plays: he follows the Greek authors, and parti∣cularly Dares Phrygius, in another: (altho' I will not pretend to say in what language he read them.) The modern Italian writers of novels he was mani∣festly acquainted with; and we may conclude him to be no less conversant with the ancients of his own country, from the use he has made of Chau∣cer in <HI>Troilus and Cressida,</HI> and in the <HI>Two noble Kinsmen,</HI> if that Play be his, as there goes a tra∣dition it was (and indeed it has little resemblance
<PB N="404" REF="409"/>
of Fletcher, and more of our Author than some of those which have been received as genuine.)</P>
<P>I am inclined to think, this opinion proceeded originally from the zeal of the Partizans of our Au∣thor and Ben Johnson; as they endeavoured to ex∣alt the one at the expence of the other. It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and no∣thing is so probable, as that because Ben Johnson had much the more learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and be∣cause Shakespear had much the most wit and fan∣cy, it was retorted on the other, that Johnson wanted both. Because Shakespear borrowed no∣thing, it was said that Ben Johnson borrowed every thing. Because Johnson did not write extempore, he was reproached with being a year about every piece; and because Shakespear wrote with ease and rapidity, they cried, he never once made a blot. Nay the spirit of opposition ran so high, that whatever those of the one side objected to the other, was taken at the rebound, and turned into praises; as injudiciously, as their antagonists before had made them objections.</P>
<P>Poets are always afraid of envy; but sure they have as much reason to be afraid of admiration. They are the Scylla and Charybdis of Authors; those who escape one, often fall by the other. <HI>Pessimum genus inimicorum laudantes,</HI> says Tacitus: and Virgil desires to wear a charm against those who praise a poet without rule or reason.</P>
<P><Q><PB N="405" REF="410"/>
<L>Si ultra placitum laudârit, baccare frontem Cingito, ne vati noceat.</L></Q>
But however this contention might be carried on by the Partizans on either side, I cannot help think∣ing these two great poets were good friends, and lived on amicable terms, and in offices of society with each other. It is an acknowledged fact, that Ben Johnson was introduced upon the stage, and his first works encouraged, by Shakespear. And after his death, that Author writes <HI>To the memory of his beloved Mr.</HI> William Shakespear, which shews as if the friendship had continued thro' life. I cannot for my own part find any thing <HI>invidious</HI> or <HI>sparing</HI> in those verses, but wonder Mr. Dryden was of that opinion. He exalts him not only above all his contemporaries, but above Chaucer and Spenser, whom he will not allow to be great enough to be ranked with him; and challenges the names of Sophocles, Euripides, and Aeschylus, nay all Greece and Rome at once, to equal him; and (which is very particular) expresly vindicates him from the imputation of wanting <HI>art,</HI> not en∣during that all his excellencies should be attributed to <HI>nature.</HI> It is remarkable too, that the praise he gives him in his <HI>Discoveries</HI> seems to proceed from a <HI>personal kindness;</HI> he tells us that he lov'd the man, as well as honoured his memory; cele∣brates the honesty, openness, and frankness of his temper; and only distinguishes, as he reasonably
<PB N="406" REF="411"/>
ought, between the real merit of the Author, and the silly and derogatory applauses of the Players. Ben Johnson might indeed be sparing in his com∣mendations, (tho' certainly he is not so in this in∣stance) partly from his own nature, and partly from judgment. For men of judgment think they do any man more service in praising him justly, than lavishly. I say, I would fain believe they were friends, tho' the violence and ill-breeding of their followers and flatterers were enough to give rise to the contrary report. I would hope that it may be with <HI>parties,</HI> both in wit and state, as with those monsters described by the poets; and that their heads at least may have something human, tho' their <HI>bodies</HI> and <HI>tails</HI> are wild beasts and ser∣pents.</P>
<P>As I believe that what I have mentioned gave rise to the opinion of Shakespear's want of learn∣ing; so what has continued it down to us may have been the many blunders and illiteracies of the first publishers of his works. In these editions their ignorance shines in almost every page; no∣thing is more common than <HI>Actus tertia. Exit omnes. Enter three witches solus.</HI> Their French is as bad as their Latin, both in construction and spelling: Their very Welsh is false. Nothing is more likely than that those palpable blunders of Hector's quoting Aristotle, with others of that gross kind, sprung from the same root: it not be∣ing at all credible that these could be the errors of
<PB N="407" REF="412"/>
any man who had the least tincture of a school, or the least conversation with such as had. Ben Johnson (whom they will not think partial to him) allows him at least to have had <HI>some</HI> Latin; which is utterly inconsistent with mistakes like these. Nay the constant blunders in proper names of per∣sons and places, are such as must have proceeded from a man, who had not so much as read any history, in any language: so could not be Shake∣spear's.</P>
<P>I shall now lay before the reader some of those almost innumerable errors, which have risen from one source, the ignorance of the players, both as his actors, and as his editors. When the nature and kinds of these are enumerated and considered, I dare to say that not Shakespear only, but Aristotle or Cicero, had their works undergone the same fate, might have appeared to want sense as well as learning.</P>
<P>It is not certain that any one of his plays was published by himself. During the time of his em∣ployment in the Theatre, several of his pieces were printed separately in quarto. What makes me think that most of these were not published by him, is the excessive carelessness of the press: every page is so scandalously false spelled, and almost all the learned or unusual words so intolerably man∣gled, that it's plain there either was no corrector to the press at all, or one totally illiterate. If any were supervised by himself, I should fancy the two
<PB N="408" REF="413"/>
parts of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Midsummer-Night's Dream</HI> might have been so: because I find no other printed with any exactness; and (contrary to the rest) there is very little variation in all the sub∣sequent editions of them. There are extant two prefaces, to the first quarto edition of <HI>Troilus and Cressida</HI> in 1609, and to that of <HI>Othello;</HI> by which it appears, that the first was published with∣out his knowledge or consent, and even before it was acted, so late as seven or eight years before he died; and that the latter was not printed till after his death. The whole number of genuine plays which we have been able to find printed in his life∣time, amounts but to eleven. And of some of these, we meet with two or more editions by dif∣ferent printers, each of which has whole heaps of trash different from the other: which I should fancy was occasioned by their being taken from different copies, belonging to different Play-houses.</P>
<P>The folio edition (in which all the plays we now receive as his, were first collected) was pub∣lished by two Players, Heminges and Condell, in 1623, seven years after his decease. They de∣clare, that all the other editions were stolen and surreptitious, and affirm theirs to be purged from the errors of the former. This is true as to the literal errors, and no other; for in all respects else it is far worse than the quarto's.</P>
<P>First, because the additions of trifling and bom∣bast passages are in this edition far more numerous.
<PB N="409" REF="414"/>
For whatever had been added, since those quarto's by the actors, or had stolen from their mouths in∣to the written parts, were from thence conveyed into the printed text, and all stand charged upon the Author. He himself complained of this usage in <HI>Hamlet,</HI> where he wishes that <HI>those who play the Clowns would speak no more than is set down for them.</HI> (Act. iii. Sc. iv.) But as a proof that he could not escape it, in the old editions of <HI>Romeo and Juliet</HI> there is no hint of a great number of the mean conceits and ribaldries now to be found there. In others, the low scenes of Mobs, Plebeians and Clowns, are vastly shorter than at present: And I have seen one in particular (which seems to have belonged to the play-house, by having the parts divided with lines, and the Actors names in the margin) where several of those very passages were added in a written hand, which are since to be found in the folio.</P>
<P>In the next place, a number of beautiful pas∣sages which are extant in the first single editions, are omitted in this: as it seems without any other reason, than their willingness to shorten some scenes: These men (as it was said of Procrustes) either lopping, or stretching an Author, to make him just fit for their stage.</P>
<P>This edition is said to be printed from the <HI>origi∣nal copies.</HI> I believe they meant those which had lain ever since the author's days in the play-house, and had from time to time been cut, or added to,
<PB N="410" REF="415"/>
arbitrarily. It appears that this edition, as well as the quarto's, was printed (at least partly) from no better copies than the <HI>prompter's book,</HI> or <HI>piece∣meal parts</HI> written out for the use of the actors: For in some places their very <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Much ado about nothing,</HI> Act ii. Enter Prince Leonato, Claudio, and <HI>Jack Wilson,</HI> instead of Balthasar. And in Act iv. <HI>Cowley,</HI> and <HI>Kemp,</HI> constantly thro' a whole scene. <BIBL>Edit. Fol. of 1623, and 1632.</BIBL></NOTE>names are through carelessness set down instead of the <HI>personae drama∣tis:</HI> And in others the notes of direction to the <HI>property-men</HI> for their <HI>moveables,</HI> and to the <HI>players</HI> for their <HI>entries,</HI> are inserted into the text, thro' the ignorance of the transcribers.</P>
<P>The Plays not having been before so much as distinguished by <HI>acts</HI> and <HI>scenes,</HI> they are in this edition divided according as they played them; of∣ten where there is no pause in the action, or where they thought fit to make a breach in it, for the sake of musick, masques, or monsters.</P>
<P>Sometimes the scenes are transposed and shuffled backward and forward; a thing which could no otherwise happen, but by their being taken from separate and piece-meal written parts.</P>
<P>Many verses are omitted entirely, and others transposed; from whence invincible obscurities have arisen, past the guess of any commentator to clear up, but just where the accidental glimpse of an old edition enlightens us.</P>
<P>Some characters were confounded and mix'd,
<PB N="411" REF="416"/>
or two put into one, for want of a competent number of actors. Thus in the quarto edition of <HI>Midsummer Night's Dream,</HI> Act v. Shakespear in∣troduces a kind of Master of the revels called Phi∣lostrate; all whose part is given to another charac∣ter (that of Egeus) in the subsequent editions: So also in <HI>Hamlet</HI> and <HI>King Lear.</HI> This too makes it probable, that the prompter's books were what they called the original copies.</P>
<P>From liberties of this kind, many speeches also were put into the mouths of wrong persons, where the Author now seems chargeable with making them speak out of character: Or sometimes per∣haps for no better reason, than that a governing player, to have the mouthing of some favourite speech himself, would snatch it from the unwor∣thy lips of an underling.</P>
<P>Prose from verse they did not know, and they accordingly printed one for the other throughout the volume.</P>
<P>Having been forced to say so much of the play∣ers, I think I ought in justice to remark, that the judgment, as well as condition, of that class of people was then far inferior to what it is in our days. As then the best playhouses were inns and tavern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (the Globe, the Hope, the Red Bull, the Fortune▪ etc.) so the top of the profession were then meer players, not gentlemen of the stage: They were led into the buttery by the steward, not placed at the lord's table, or lady's toilette: and consequently
<PB N="412" REF="417"/>
were entirely deprived of those advantages they now enjoy, in the familiar conversation of our nobility, and an intimacy (not to say dearness) with people of the first condition.</P>
<P>From what has been said, there can be no ques∣tion but had Shakespear published his works him∣self (especially in his latter time, and after his re∣treat from the stage) we should not only be cer∣tain which are genuine; but should find in those that are, the errors lessened by some thousands. If I may judge from all the distinguishing marks of his style, and his manner of thinking and writ∣ing, I make no doubt to declare that those wretch∣ed plays, <HI>Pericles, Locrine, Sir John Oldcastle, Yorkshire Tragedy, Lord Cromwell, The Puri∣tan,</HI> and <HI>London Prodigal,</HI> cannot be admitted as his. And I should conjecture of some of the others (particularly <HI>Love's Labour's Lost, The Winter's Tale,</HI> and <HI>Titus Andronicus)</HI> that only some characters, single scenes, or perhaps a few particular passages, were of his hand. It is very probable what occasioned some plays to be supposed Shakespear's was only this; that they were pieces produced by unknown authors, or fitted up for the theatre while it was under his administration: and no owner claiming them, they were adjudged to him, as they give strays to the Lord of the manor: a mistake which (one may also observe) it was not for the interest of the house to remove. Yet the players themselves, Heminges and Condell, af∣terwards
<PB N="413" REF="418"/>
did Shakespear the justice to reject those eight plays in their edition; tho' they were then printed in his name, in every body's hands, and acted with some applause; (as we learn from what Ben Johnson says of <HI>Pericles</HI> in his Ode on the <HI>New-Inn.)</HI> That <HI>Titus Andronicus</HI> is one of this class I am the rather induced to believe, by finding the same Author openly express his contempt of it in the <HI>Induction</HI> to <HI>Bartholomew-Fair,</HI> in the year 1614, when Shakespear was yet living. And there is no better authority for these latter sort, than for the former, which were equally published in his life-time.</P>
<P>If we give into this opinion, how many low and vicious parts and passages might no longer reflect upon this great genius, but appear unworthily charged upon him? And even in those which are really his, how many faults may have been unjust∣ly laid to his account from arbitrary additions, ex∣punctions, transpositions of scenes and lines, con∣fusion of characters and persons, wrong application of speeches, corruptions of innumerable passages by the ignorance, and wrong corrections of them again by the impertinence of his first editors? From one or other of these considerations, I am verily persuaded, that the greatest and the grossest part of what are thought his errors would vanish, and leave his character in a light very different from that disadvantageous one, in which it now appears to us.</P>
<P><PB N="414" REF="419"/>
This is the state in which Shakespear's writings lie at present; for, since the abovementioned folio edition, all the rest have implicitly followed it, without having recourse to any of the former, or ever making the comparison between them. It is impossible to repair the injuries already done him; too much time has elapsed, and the mate∣rials are too few. In what I have done I have rather given a proof of my willingness and de∣sire, than of my ability, to do him justice. I have discharged the dull duty of an Editor, to my best judgment, with more labour than I expect thanks, with a religious abhorrence of all innovation, and without any indulgence to my private sense or conjecture. The method taken in this edition will shew itself. The various readings are fairly put in the margin, so that every one may compare them; and those I have prefer∣ed into the text are constantly <HI>ex fide codicum,</HI> up∣on authority. The alterations or additions which Shakespear himself made, are taken notice of as they occur. Some suspected passages which are excessively bad (and which seem interpolations by being so inserted that one can intirely omit them without any chasm, or deficience in the con∣text) are degraded to the bottom of the page; with an asterisk referring to the places of their insertion. The scenes are marked so distinctly that every re∣moval of place is specify'd; which is more neces∣sary in this Author than any other, since he shifts
<PB N="415" REF="420"/>
them more frequently: and sometimes without attending to this particular, the reader would have met with obscurities. The more obsolete or un∣usual words are explained. Some of the most shining passages are distinguished by comma's in the margin: and where the beauty lay not in par∣ticulars but in the whole, a star is prefixed to the scene. This seems to me a shorter and less osten∣tatious method of performing the better half of Criticism (namely the pointing out an Author's excellencies) than to fill a whole paper with cita∣tions of fine passages, with <HI>general applauses,</HI> or <HI>empty exclamations</HI> at the tail of them. There is also subjoined a catalogue of those first editions by which the greater part of the various readings and of the corrected passages are authorised (most of which are such as carry their own evidence along with them.) These editions now hold the place of originals, and are the only materials left to re∣pair the deficiencies or restore the corrupted sense of the Author: I can only wish that a greater num∣ber of them (if a greater were ever published) may yet be found, by a search more successful than mine, for the better accomplishment of this end.</P>
<P>I will conclude by saying of Shakespear, that with all his faults, and with all the irregularity of his <HI>drama,</HI> one may look upon his works, in com∣parison of those that are more finished and regular, as upon an ancient majestick piece of Gothic ar∣chitecture, compared with a neat modern build∣ing:

The latter is more elegant and glaring, but the former is more strong and more solemn. It must be allowed, that in one of these there are materials enough to make many of the other. It has much the greater variety, and much the nobler apartments; tho' we are often conducted to them by dark, odd, and uncouth passages.

Randal with all his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rush'd into the room; and new every hand conspired to free his under-Jaw from the Sharp <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>raged Monster. But the Lady, whose heart melt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at the pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecus Spectacle, was so zealous in this office of hu∣manity, that the Cat-a-mountain, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vok'd at her good∣natur'd diligence, leap'd suriously on her, and mounted three of her Hands and her two Noses, to such a barba∣reas

degree, that she was not fit to be shown publickly for the sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of three Weeks. The generous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>r, men wounded at this Spectacle than by all the scratches he had himself re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d, charg'd the monster again wish the utmost intripidity, and rescued his mangled Mistress. Then (having taken her by the stand, and given it a gentle grasp) he retreated with his eyes fixed upon her▪ and just as he left the room (in a l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and tender <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) thus breath'd forth his Soul: "Behold, all this have I "suffer'd for you".</P>
<P>Such, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> medist was the first declaration of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, made on this eminent occasion by our Youthful Phi∣losepher. Nor was it ungently received by the simple and innocent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indamira; who, hitherto unus'd to the soft. Pretistations <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fadering Slaves, had rather been won der'd at than belov'd and receiv'd but imperfect nations of that tender language, from the Addresses only of the black Prince or the Dwarf.</P>
<P>Martin, notwithstanding this unfortunate adventure, still pursu'd his wishes. His <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tters were now no more intercepted. Lindamira read them, and behav'd like other courteous dames when they receive those am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous Testimonials; conceal'd them from her Guardian, and
<PB N="433" REF="440"/>
return'd the most engaging answers. In short, she was so far captivated as to resolve no longer to be gaz'd at like a public Beauty in her own. Assembly; but retire from the World, and become the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mistress of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nily.</P>
<P>But fate had so ordain'd, that Martin was not more enamour'd on Lindamira, than Indamera was on Martin. She, jealous that her Sister had the great∣est share in this conquest, resented that an equal application had not been made to herself she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lindamira to such a degree on this Subject, as made her promise to see Martin no more. But then again might Indamera be deem'd the unhappiest of Women, whom her Passion and Imprudence had robb'd of the sight of her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet shame caused her to reneval these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harieties from her sister. And let the Reader judge here unhappy the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymph must be, who waseven de∣prived the universal Relief of a Selilequy. However, thus she thought, without bring allow'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to any Greve or purling Stream.</P>
<P>Wretched Indamora! if Lindamira must never men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee Martin, Martin shall never again bless the Eyes of Indamera. Yet why d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay wretched, since my Rival

<P>From that moment she studied by all methods to ad∣vance her Sister's Amour, and in that her own. And thus there appear'd in these three Lovers as extraordinary a Conjunction of Passions as of Persons: Love had r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>con∣eil'd himself to his mortal f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, to Philosophy in Mar∣tin, and to jealousy in Indamera.</P>
<P>And new flourish'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mour of Martin; success <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vented his wishes, the Marriage was agreed on, and the day appointed. Sunday was the time, when <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Randal's absence farour'd their hopes, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on that day omitted taking the fresh air in the Fields: the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey of the door he always look with him.

Ladder was thrown up, and the signal given at the Window Lindamira hasten'd to the alarm of Love, when behold a new disaster! as she was g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting out of the Win∣dow, the weight of her Body on one side, and that of In∣damera's on the other, unluckily caus'd them to stick in the midway: Lindamira hung with her coats stript up to the navel without, and Indamera in no less posture within. The Manteger, who for his gentleness was allowed to walk at large in the house, was so heighten'd of this sight, that he rush'd upon Indamera like a barbarous Ravisher. Indamera cried aloud for help.</P>

Our heroic Lover, who held his hat before him like a shield, receiv'd the weapon full on the crown; it pierc'd the beaver, and gave a small rent to his breeches. Then the human slung with mighty violence the hinder feet of an Elk, which hit the bestial combatant full on the nether Jaw. He reel'd, but soon recovering, and his skill in War lying rather in the close fight then in projectile weapons, he endeavour'd to close with him: forth with assailing him behind unawares, he clamber'd up his back, and pluck'd up by the roots a mighty grasp of hair∣but Martin soon dismounted him, and kept him at a distance. Love not only inspired his breast with Courage, but gave double strength to his sine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; he hear'd up the han<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a prodigious Sea-monster; which when the chalt'ring Champion behold, he no less furious, wielded the Pendious Thigh-bone of a Giant. And now they stood oppos'd to each other, like the dread Explain of the seven-fold shield and the redoubted hector. The Thigh-bone miss'd its aim; but the hand of the Sea-monster deseended directly
<PB N="437" REF="444"/>
on the head of the Sylvan Rarisher. The Monster chatter'd horrible; he stretch'd his quir'ring Limbs on the floor; and eternal Sleep leck'd fast his Eye-lids.</P>
<P>The lady from the window, like another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elen from the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ejan wall, was witness of the Combat caused by her own Beauty. She saw with what gracefulness her Here enter'd the Lists, admir'd his activity and courage in the Combat, and was a joyful witness of his triumph: She gave a spring from the window, and with open arms and Segs embraced the Neck and Shoulders of her Champion. Our Philosopher receiv'd her with his Face turn'd modestly from her, and in that manner convey'd her into the Street.

Martin▪ So he instantly went to counsel to adrise upon all possible methods of Revenge.</P>
<P>The first point he preceed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on was the Property of his Monster, and the question prepeunded was <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">An Sewi po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in vitis Dominis, Matrimonium contrahere?</NOTE><Q>“Whether Slaves could marry without the consent of their Master?”</Q> To this he was answer'd in the Affirmative, but told at the same time <Q>“That <NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">An Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Matrimonio <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a Demini obsequie?</NOTE>the Marriage did not exempt them from Servitude.”</Q></P>
<P>This put him in no small h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of having Martin added to his show, and acquiring a property in his Bedily issue
<PB N="439" REF="446" MS="y"/>
by the Ladies. But his joy was seen dasn'd, when he was in∣form'd that since Martin was a free man, <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">An Liberi seq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untur Conditionem Patris, an Matris</NOTE><Q>“The Chil∣dren must follow the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather: or, that in died, if they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o follow that of their Mother, the Case would be the same, there being no Slavery in England.”</Q></P>
<P>Then his Counsel judged it more advisable to plead for a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issolution of the Marriage, upon the impossibility of Conjugal du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife. But then the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anen Law al∣low'd a Jriennial <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehabitation; which intirely ruin'd this project also. Besides it was evident by the same. Law, that "Monstrosity could not incapacitate from Marriage," witness the Case of Hermaphrodites, who are allow'd "facultation Conjugü, provided they make Election be∣fore the Parish Priest, in what for they will act, and take an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> never to perform in the other Capacity." <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Sanchez, Hostiens.

But then again they consider'd, that Martin might an∣swer, he claim'd nothing but his own; and if another per∣son had fix'd herself to his Wife, he must not for that cause be debarr'd the use of his Property.</P>
<P>Yet still, upon the same head of Martins possessing his o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use, a Suit might be derised in the name of Lindamira, on this account; <NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x or non tenetur vivere cum vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Concubinam tenente</NOTE>That a "Wife was not obliged to live with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oncubine, and such her Sister Indamora must be accounted to Martin from the common <NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s, ampplxus, cohabitalie</NOTE>proofs." So this too it was replied, that the Lawerder'd the Wife to r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>side with the Husband if there were sufficient security given to ex∣pell the concubine. So Martin might say he was ready to accomplish his part of the covenant, if his Wife would per∣form hers, and consent to the <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">An <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tender Incisionem pali?

<P>Wereupon Martin was reduc'd to turn Plaintiff, and commenc'd a Suit in the Spiritual Court against the black Prince, for Cohabitation with his said Wife.

<P>The Monster-master, further to distress Martin, forc'd Sin∣damira to petition for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pendente: which was no sooner allow'd her by the Court, but he obliged her to alledge, that, <Q>“it was not sufficient to maintain both her∣self and her Sister; and if her Sister perish'd, she could not live with the dead Body about her.”</Q></P>
<P>Martin now began to repent that he not executed a resolution he formerly conceiv'd, of marrying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Indamora, as an Expedient to have made all secure. Moreover, it was insisted on; that the other also had a right to Miment, <Q>“because, if Martins Wife should prove with, the said Sister must

<P><Q>“”We need not tell your Honour, that it has been the opini∣on of many most learned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irines and Phylosephers, that the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul, as well as Body, is produced <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> traduc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

All which arguments conclude with equall strength, for the Soul's being seated in the organs of Generation. For since the whole Man, both Soul and Body, is there form'd, and since nothing can operate but where it is, it follows, that the Soul must reside in that individual place, where She exerts her generatir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and plastic pow∣ers.</Q></P>

<Q>“”This our doctrine is confirm'd by all these Experiments, which conspire to prove the absolute dominion which that part hath over the whole Body.

The impressions made by the Ear are so distant, and transmitted thro' so many windings, that they lose their Energy: But your honour, by immediately applying to the organ of generation, gets like a bold and wise Petitioner, who goes strait to the very throne and Judgment-Seal of the Monarch. And whereas it is objected that here are two Wills, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> different persons; we answer, if multi∣plicity of Wills implied multiplicity of Persons, there are few Husbands but what are guilty of Polygamy, there being in the same woman great and notorious diversi∣ty of Wills: A point which we shall not need to insist upon before any married person, much less of your Honour's Experience.</Q></P>

<Q>“”Thus we have made <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed our first and principal point; That if the Wife of the Plaintiff, Lindamira-Indamora, hath but one Organ of Generation, she is but one individual Person, in the truest and most proper Sense of Individuality. And that the matter of Sad is so, we are willing to put up on a fair Trial by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atrons, whom year Honour shall think fit to nominate and appoint, to inspect the Body of the said Lindamira-Indamora.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“”Secondly, We are to prove, that tho' Lindamira-Indamora were two individual Persons, consisting each of a Soul and Body, yet, if they have but one Organ of Generation, they can constitute but one Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, from whence can the Unity of any thing be denominated, but from that which constitutes the Essence or principal use of it? Thus, if a knife or hatche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have but one blade, though two handles, it will properly be denominated but one knife, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hatche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in as much as it hath but one of that which constitutes the Essence or principal Use of a knife or hatche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. So if there were not only one, but twenty Supposita Rationalia with one common Organ of Generation, that one System would only make
