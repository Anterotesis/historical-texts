<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<L>WHAT various revolutions in our art,</L>
<L>Since Thespis first sung ballads in a cart!</L>
<L>By nature fram'd the witty war to wage,</L>
<L>And lay the deep foundations of the stage,</L>
<L>From his own soil that bard his pictures drew:</L>
<L>The gaping crowd the mimic features knew,</L>
<L>And the broad jest with fire electric flew.</L>
<L>Succeeding times, more polish'd and refin'd,</L>
<L>To rigid rules the comic muse confin'd:</L>
<L>Robb'd of the nat'ral freedom of her song,</L>
<L>In artful measures now she floats along;</L>
<L>No sprightly sallies rouse the slumb'ring pit;</L>
<L>Thalia, grown mere architect in wit,</L>
<L>To doors and ladders has confin'd her cares,</L>
<L>Convenient closets, and a snug back-stairs;</L>
<L>'Twixt her and Satire has dissolv'd the league,</L>
<L>And jilted humour to enjoy intrigue.</L>
<L>To gain the suff'rage of this polish'd age,</L>
<L>We bring to-night a stranger on the stage:</L>
<L>His sire De Vega; we confess this truth,</L>
<L>Lest you mistake him for a British youth.</L>
<L>Severe the censure on my feeble pen,</L>
<L>Neglecting manners, that she copies men:</L>
<L>Thus, if I hum or ha, or name report,</L>
<L>'Tis Serjeant Splitcause from the inns of court;</L>
<L>If, at the age that ladies cease to dance,</L>
<L>To romp at Ranelagh, or read romance,</L>
<L>I draw a dowager inclin'd to man,</L>
<L>Or paint her rage for china or japan,</L>
<L>The true original is quickly known,</L>
<L>And Lady Squab proclaim'd throughout the town.</L>
<L>But in the following group let no man dare</L>
<L>To claim a limb, nay, not a single hair:</L>
<L>What gallant Briton can be such a sot</L>
<L>To own the child a Spaniard has begot.</L>

<P>Ah, bravo, bravo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but, my dear Papillion, you must give me the chart du paye: This town is a new world to me; my provident papa, you know, would never suffer me near the smoak of London; and what can be his motive for per∣mitting me now, I can't readily conceive.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Mentor, and how am I to manage? direct my road: where must I begin? but the debate is, I suppose, of consequence?</P>

<P>How long have you left Paris, Pa∣pillion?</P>

<P>I can't compliment you upon your progress in English.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>The accent is difficult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well then, open your lecture: And, d'ye hear, Papillion, as you have the honour to be promoted from the mortifying condition of an humble valet, to the important charge of a private tutor, let us discard all distance between us: See me ready to slack my thirst at your fountain of knowledge, my Magnus Apollo.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey, Papillion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is this? why, you speak English!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>But like a native!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what am I to conclude from all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Logically thus, Sir: Whoever speaks pure English is an Englishman: I speak pure English; ergo, I am an Englishman. There's a categorical fyllogism for you, Major, Minor, and Consequence. What, do you think, Sir, that whilst you was busy at Oxford, I was idle? no, no, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, but notwithstanding your pleasantry, I must have this matter explain'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you shall, my good Sir; but don't be in such a hurry: You can't suppose I would give you the key, unless I meant you should open the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, prythee, unlock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately. But, by way of entering upon my post as preceptor, suffer me first to give you a hint: You must not expect, Sir, to find here, as at Oxford, men appearing in their real characters; every body there, Sir, knows that Dr. Mussy is a fellow of Maudlin, and Tom Trifle a student of Christchurch; but this town is one great comedy, in which not only the prin∣ciples, but frequently the persons are feign'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A useful observation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now, Sir, at the first coffee-house I shall enter you, you will perhaps meet a man from whose decent sable dress, placid counte∣nance, insinuating behaviour, short sword, with the waiter's civil addition of "a dish of coffee
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
for Dr. Julap," you would suppose him to be a physician.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not know diascordium from dia∣culum. An absolute French spy, conceal'd un∣der the shelter of a huge medicinal perriwig.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>A martial figure too, it is odds but you will encounter; from whose sears, title, dress, and address, you would suppose to have had a share in every action since the peace of the Py∣renees: runner to a gaming-table, and bully to a bawdy-house. Battles, to be sure, he has been in—with the watch; and frequently a prisoner too—in the round-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, Sir, you will meet with lawyers who practise smuggling, and merchants who trade upon Hounslow-heath; reverend atheists, righ honourable sharpers; and Frenchmen f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the county of York.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the last list, I presume, you roll.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just my situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, what may be your <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for this wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>msical transformation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very harmless one, I promise you: I would only avail myself at the expence of folly and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir—But, to be better under∣stood, I believe it will be necessary to give you a short sketch of the principal incidents of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you are to know, Sir, that my former situation has been rather above my present condition, having once sustained the dig∣nity of sub-preceptor to one of those cheap rural
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
academies with which our county of York is so plentifully stock'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to the point: Why this disguise? why renounce your country?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>There, Sir, you make a little mistake; it was my country that renounc'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>In an instant, upon quitting the school, and first coming to town, I got recommended to the compiler of the Monthly Review.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, an author too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a voluminous one: the whole re∣gion of the belles lettres fell under my inspec∣tion; physic, divinity, and the mathematics, my mistress manag'd herself. There, Sir, like an∣other Aristarch, I dealt out fame and damnation at pleasure. In obedience to the caprice and commands of my master, I have condemn'd books I never read, and applauded the fidelity of a translation, without understanding one syllable of the original.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! why I thought acuteness of dis∣cernment, and depth of knowledge, were ne∣cessary to accomplish a critic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; but not a monthly one. Our method was very concise: We copy the title∣page of a new book; we never go any further: if we are order'd to praise it, we have at hand about ten words, which, scatter'd through as many periods, effectually does the business; as, "laudable design, happy arrangement, spirited language, nervous sentiment, elevation of thought, conclusive argument;" if we are to decry, then we have, "unconnected, flat, false, illiberal stric∣ture, reprehensible, unnatural:" and thus, Sir, we pepper the author, and soon rid our hands of his work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A short recipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Sir, you have all the materials that are necessary: These are the arms with which we engage authors of every kind. To us all subjects are equal; plays or sermons, poetry or politics, music or midwifry, it is the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came you to resign this easy employment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not answer. Notwithstanding what we say, people will judge for themselves; our work hung upon hand, and all I could get from the publisher was four shillings a-week, and my small beer. Poor pittance!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, half-starv'd me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was your next change?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was mightily puzzled to choose. Some would have had me turn player, and others me∣thodist preacher; but as I had no money to build me a tabernacle, I did not think it could answer; and as to a player—whatever might happen to me, I was determin'd not to bring a disgrace upon my family, and so I resolv'd to turn footman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wisely resolv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, but not so easily executed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no, Sir. Many a weary step have I taken after a place: here I was too old, there I was too young; here the last livery was too big, there it was too little; here I was aukward, there I was knowing; madam dissik'd me at this house, her ladyship's woman at the next: So that I was as much puzzled to find out a place, as the great Cynic philosopher to discover a man. In short, I was quite in a state of despair, when Chance threw an old friend in my way that quite retriev'd my affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray who might he be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little bit of a Swiss genius, who had been French usher with me at the same school in the country. I open'd my melancholy story to him, over three pennyworth of beef-a la∣mode, in a cellar in St. Ann's. My little foreign friend purs'd up his lanthorn jaws, and with a shrug of contempt, "Ah, maître Jean, vous n'avez pas la politique; you have no finesse: to trive here you must study the folly of your own country." "How, Monsieur!" "Taisez vous. Keep a your tongue! autre foy! I teach you speak French, now I teach a you to forget Eng∣lish. Go vid me to my logement, I vil give you proper dress; den go present yourself to de same hotels, de very same house; you will find all de doors dat was shut in your face as footman An∣glois, will fly open demselves to a French valet de chambre."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Papillion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gad, Sir, I thought it was but an ho∣nest artifice, so I determin'd to follow my friend's advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did it succeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better than expectation: my tawny face, long queüe, and broken English, was a pas par tout. Besides, when I am out of place, this disguise procures me many resources.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, at a pinch, Sir, I am either a teacher of tongues, a frizeur, a dentist, or a dancing-master; these, Sir, are hereditary profes∣sions to Frenchmen. But now, Sir, to the point: As you were pleas'd to be so candid with me, I was determin'd to have no reserve with you. You have study'd books, I have study'd men; you want advice, and I have some at your service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll be your customer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>But guard my secret: if I should be so unfortunate to lose your place, don't shut me out from every other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may rely upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a few years I shall be in a condition to retire from business; but whether I shall set∣tle at my family-seat, or pass over to the conti∣nent, is as yet undetermined. Perhaps, in gra∣titude to the country, I may purchase a marqui∣sate near Paris, and spend the money I have got by their means, generously amongst them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A grateful intention. But let us sally. Where do we open?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us see—one o'clock—it is a fine day: the Mall will be crowded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't stare, Sir: survey every thing with an air of habit and indifference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I would, Sir, crave a moment's au∣dience, upon a subject that may prove very ma∣terial to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will pardon my presumption; but you have, my good master, one little foible that I could wish you to correct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What is it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have, Sir, a lively imagination, with a most happy turn for invention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now and then in your narratives you are hurry'd, by a flow of spirits, to border upon the improbable, a little given to the marvellous.</P>

<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you: what, I am some∣what subject to lying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, pardon me, Sir; I don't say that; no, no: only a little apt to embellish; that's all. To be sure it is a fine gift; that there is no dis∣puting: but men in general are so stupid; so ri∣gorously attach'd to matter of fact—And yet this talent of yours is the very soul and spirit of poetry; and why it should not be the same in prose, I can't for my life determine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would advise me, then, not to be quite so poetical in my prose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, if you would descend a little to the grovelling comprehension of the million, I think it would be as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Sir, in this town people are more smoaky and suspicious. Oxford, you know, is the seat of the muses, and a man is naturally permitted more ornament and garniture to his conversation than they will allow in this latitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you are right. But we shall be late. D'ye hear me, Papillion: if at any time you find me growing too poetical, give me a hint; your advice shan't be thrown away.</P>

<P>I wish it mayn't; but the disease is too rooted to be quickly remov'd. Lord, how I have sweat for him! yet he is as unimbarrassed, easy, and fluent, all the time, as if he really be∣liev'd what he said. Well, to be sure he is a great master; it is a thousand pities his genius could not be converted to some public service: I think the government should employ him to answer the Brussels Gazette. I'll be hang'd if he is not too many for Monsieur Maubert, at his own weapons.</P>

<P>John, let the chariot go round to Spring-Gardens, for your mistress and I shall call at Lady Bab's, Miss Arabella Allnight's, the countess of Crumple's, and the tall man's, this morning. My dear Miss Godfrey, what trouble I have had to get you out! why, child, you are as tedious as a long mourning.

<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Decent! oh, my dear queer creature, what a phrase have you found out for a woman of fashion! Decency is, child, a mere bourgois plebeian quality, and fit only for those who pay court to the world, and not for us to whom the world pays court. Upon my word, you must enlarge your ideas: you are a fine girl, and we must not have you lost; I'll undertake you my∣self. But, as I was saying—Pray, my dear, what was I saying?</P>

<P>A most happy incident for me, Ma∣dam; as Chance has given me an honour in one

<P>Is this meant to me, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>To whom else, Madam? Surely, you must have mark'd my respectful assiduity, my uninterrupted attendance; to plays, operas, balls, routs, and ridottas, I have pursued you like your shadow; I have besieg'd your door for a glimpse of your exit and entrance, like a dis∣tressed creditor, who has no arms against privi∣lege but perseverance.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Full four years, Ma'am: and during that whole time, not a single action of conse∣quence, but I had an opportunity to signalize myself; and I think I may, without vanity, af∣firm I did not miss the occasion. You have heard of Quebec, I presume?</P>

<P>What the deuce is he driving at now?</P>

<P>I have heard the honour of that con∣quest attributed to another name.</P>

<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
exact we, who know the business, are at calculation: For instance now, we will suppose the commander in chief, addressing himself to me, was to say, "Colonel, I want to reduce that fortress; what will be the expence?" "Why, please your highness, the reduction of that fortress will cost you one thousand and two lives, sixty-nine legs, ditto arms, fourscore frac∣tures, with about twenty dozen of flesh wounds."</P>
</SP>

<P>And you should be near the mark?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>To an odd joint, Ma'am. But, Ma∣dam, it is not to the French alone that my feats are confin'd: Cherokees, Catabaws, with all the Aws and Ees of the continent, have felt the force of my arms.</P>

<P>This is too much, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Hands off! Nor am I less adroit at a treaty, Madam, than terrible in battle: To me we owe the friendship of the Five Nations, and I had the first honour of smoaking the pipe of peace with the Little Carpenter.</P>

<P>This gentleman, though a French∣man and an enemy, I had the fortune to deli∣ver from the Mohawks, whose prisoner he had been for nine years.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, you are impos'd upon. This gentleman (whom first give me leave to have the honour of introducing to you), this, Sir, is the marquis de Chatteau Briant, of an ancient house in Brittany; who travelling thro' England, chose to make Oxford for some time the place of his residence, where I had the hap∣piness of his acquaintance.</P>

<P>Monsieur le marquis!—And pray, Sir, who could tell you all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>An old friend of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>His name, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir James Elliot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; I thought he was the man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, though Sir James Elliot has a great many good qualities, and is, upon the whole, a valuable man, yet he has one fault which has long determined me to drop his ac∣quaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>What may that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you can't, Sir, be a stranger to his prodigious skill in the traveller's talent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, notorious to a proverb.—His friends, who are tender of his fame, gloss over his foible, by calling him an agreeable novelist; and so he is, with a vengeance: Why, he will tell you more lyes in an hour, than all the cir∣culating libraries, put together, will publish in a year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he is the modern Mandeville at Oxford: he was always distinguish'd by the fa∣cetious appellation of the Bouncer.</P>

<P>Amazing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Sir, he is so well understood in his own country, that at the last Hereford assize a cause, as clear as the sun, was absolutely thrown away by his being merely mentioned as a witness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>A strange turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unaccountable. But there, I think, they went a little too far; for if it had come to an oath, I don't think he would have bounc'd neither; but in common occurrences there is no repeating after him. Indeed, my great reason for dropping him was, that my credit began to be a little suspected too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pap.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor gentleman!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I never heard this of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be: but can there be a stronger proof of his practice than the flam he has been telling you, of fireworks, and the Lord knows what. And I dare swear, Sir, he was very fluent and florid in his description.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Extremely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Y. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is just his way; and not a syllable of truth from the beginning to the end∣ing, marquis?</P>

<P>Entirely. But, as my ill stars would have it, a cat, of whom my wife is vastly fond, had a few days before lodg'd a litter of kittens in the same place: I unhappily trod upon one of the brood, which so provok'd the implacable mother, that she flew at me with the fury of a tiger.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>HOLD, Sir.</L>
<L>Our plot concluded, and strict justice done,</L>
<L>Let me be heard as counsel for your son.</L>
<L>Acquit I can't; I mean to mitigate:</L>
<L>Proscribe all lying, what would be the fate</L>
<L>Of this and every other earthly state?</L>
<L>Consider, Sir, if once you cry it down,</L>
<L>You'll shut up ev'ry coffee-house in town:</L>
<L>The tribe of politicians will want food;</L>
<L>Ev'n now half-famish'd—for the public good.</L>
<L>All Grubstreet murderers of men and sense,</L>
<L>And every office of intelligence,</L>
<L>All would be bankrupts, the whole lying race,</L>
<L>And no Gazette to publish their disgrace.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>Too mild a sentence! must the good and great</L>
<L>Patriots be wrong'd, that booksellers may eat?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Your patience, Sir; yet hear another word.</L>
<L>Turn to that hall where justice wields her sword:</L>
<L>Think in what narrow limits you would draw,</L>
<L>By this proscription, all the sons of law:</L>
<L>For 'tis the fix'd, determin'd rule of courts,</L>
<L>Vyn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r will te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l you, nay, even Coke's Reports,</L>

<L>To curb this practice I am somewhat loath;</L>
<L>A lawyer has no credit but on oath.</L>

<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Then to the softer sex some favour shew:</L>
<L>Leave no possession of our modest No!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>Oh, freely, Ma'am, we'll that allow∣ance give,</L>

<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Hard terms!</L>
<L>On this rejoinder then I rest my cause;</L>
<L>Should all pay homage to Truth's sacred laws,</L>
<L>Let us examine what would be the case:</L>
<L>Why, many a great man would be out of place.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O. Wild.</SPEAKER>
<L>'Twould many a virtuous character restore.</L>

<L>Tho' on the side of bad the ballance fall,</L>
<L>Better to find few good, than fear for all.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. Gr.</SPEAKER>
<L>Strong are your reasons; yet, ere I submit,</L>
<L>I mean to take the voices of the pit.</L>
<L>Is it your pleasures that we make a rule,</L>
<L>That ev'ry lyar be proclaim'd a fool,</L>
<L>Fit subjects for our author's ridicule?</L>
