<HEAD>A
LETTER to M<SUP>r</SUP> HOW.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AFTER such an Account as you have
given of your self in the Five first Pages
of your Book, with the Aversion you
have to any thing which shou'd interrupt you in
your more <HI>Recluse</HI> Studies; I presume no Man
cou'd imagin you would break thorough your own
Measures to attack a <HI>poor Prefacer,</HI> as you call me,
and wholly quitting the Argument, amuse the
World, and content your self to Lash the Author
with the Severity of your Wit.</P>
<P>Herein, Sir, I must own, that not only your
Opponent, but all the Town seem Disappointed
exceedingly, that Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who thinks the Sub∣ject
not worth Answering, shou'd trouble his Head,
or spend his Time about the Impertinence of a
<HI>sorry Prefacer.</HI></P>
<P>When I Address'd the Preface to you, I thought
I had so carefully Revis'd both it and the Book,
that, as I mention'd to you, I cou'd no-where be
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"/>
tax'd with Exceeding the Rules of Charity and
Good Manners.</P>
<P>And tho' I wou'd always make them both my
Rule, yet I thought my self oblig'd to it more
now than ordinarily, by how much the person to
whom, and the persons of whom I wrote, were
equally known and very much valued by me; and
I did not question but I shou'd either not be Repli'd
to at all, or it wou'd be done with the Charity of a
<HI>Christian,</HI> the Civility of a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and the
Force and Vigour of a <HI>Scholar.</HI></P>
<P>But since it seems good to you, Sir, to descend
so far below your self as to quit the Dispute offer'd,
and fall upon me personally, and to mix Raillery
and Reproach with your Argument, <HI>which, I am
sure, you know too well to think betters the Cause:</HI> You
must blame your self, Sir, for Obliging me in my
own Defence to be a little freer with you than
otherwise I shou'd have thought had become me.</P>
<P>Nor, Sir, shou'd I have engag'd with you, even
in my own Defence, knowing I am to struggle
with so unequal a Match both as to your Learning
and Reputation, had I not seen your Book differ
so much from your Constant Character; and par∣don
me, Sir, for the Word, <HI>in many places from
the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>And since I am oblig'd thus publickly to Ani∣madvert
upon my Superiors, for such I own you
to be both in Learning and Office,</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y"/>
I shall ask your Leave to lay down several
Mistakes, upon which I must be allow'd to sup∣pose
you have gone in the Censures which you
have made; which Suppositions I draw from the
whole Tenour of your Writing.</P>
<P>I presume, Sir, that you are mistaken in these
Four Points, in the <HI>Person, Temper, Profession,</HI> and
<HI>Intention</HI> of the Author.</P>
<P>Which Mistakes, I shall venture to suppose,
are the Reasons which moved you to treat your
Adversary with so much indecent Contempt.</P>
<P>As to my Person and Temper: 'Tis true, Sir,
I have chosen to conceal my Name; and though,
bating Human Frailty, Sins and Misfortunes, I know
no Reason why the Argument should be asham'd
of the Author, or the Author of the Argument:
Yet when I consider'd how constant a practice it
is in the World to Answer an Argument with Re∣criminations
instead of Reasonings, I thought it best
to continue retir'd, that the Case I had enter'd upon
might not come clogg'd with the dead Weight of
the Meanness and Imperfections of the Author.</P>
<P>I need not go back to the Instance of our Savi∣our,
whose Arguments were Confronted with the
Contempt of that Question, <HI>Is not this the Car∣penter's
Son?</HI> For I find that even Mr. <HI>How</HI> him∣self
<PB N="4" REF="5" MS="y"/>
wou'd have search'd my Character to have
compleated his Remarks with Personal Reflecti∣ons.</P>
<P>And yet I cannot imagine what Relation my
Name has to the Argument; it cou'd be on∣ly
useful to furnish you with something in my
Character to Reproach me with; which, <HI>God
knows, you might have found enough of.</HI></P>
<P>But what wou'd all this be to the Point in hand?
The Occasional Conformity of Dissenters is not
Condemn'd or Defended by the Names of Authors
on either side, but by Truth, Scripture, and Rea∣son.</P>
<P><HI>Thou was't altogether born in Sin,</HI> says the High-Priest,
and the Elders of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> to the
Poor Man whom christ had heal'd; <HI>and doest thou
teach us?</HI> And yet the poor Man was in the Right;
and if I am so, though I was the meanest and most
scandalous of Scriblers, is my Argument the
worse?</P>
<P>But, Sir, to Answer all those Particulars, and
let you know that I am not altogether so shy of
my Name as you imagine, I shall give you a Ge∣nuine
honest Account of my self, and then my
Name is at your Service.</P>
<P>First, Sir, I am to tell you, that I am, and ac∣knowledge
my self to be, possess'd with a strong
Aversion to Doubling and Shifting in Points of
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y"/>
Religion; and do think that the Case in hand is
to be allow'd no less: and therefore wrote the
Enquiry with Two very honest Designs; <HI>viz.</HI> To
see if by Strength of Argument I cou'd receive
Satisfaction; And to Explode, and, as far as in me
lies, to Oppose the Practice.</P>
<P>Secondly, Had your Book given me, or any
body else that I can meet with, <HI>whose Judgment
is to be valued,</HI> the Satisfaction I desir'd; I assure
you, I am so little fond of an Opinion, because it
is mine, that I shou'd not have been asham'd to
have own'd my self mistaken; and possibly have
shown as much Humiliay in Acknowledging it, as
you think I have Pride in Opposing.</P>
<P>As to Personal Miscarriages and Misfortunes, of
which no Man has more, and which, perhaps, may
weaken the Reputation of the Author, but I am
sure ought not of my Argument: To them I
shall only say, God <HI>in his Merciful Providence has
heal'd the Last, and, I hope, has pardon'd the First:</HI>
And if so, I am upon even Terms in point of
Reasoning.</P>
<P>By this you may see I am sensible of the Beam
in my own Eye, and have for some years taken
up the part of a Penitent on that very account;
but did never understand that thereby I was barr'd
from Enquiring into what I judg'd Scandalous to
the Profession of a Party in General, of whom,
<HI>though unworthy,</HI> I was a Member.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7" MS="y"/>
Nor, Sir, am I any-where guilty of Judging
another, where the Case is not so plain, as that
it really seems to speak it self: For I must remem∣ber
also, that we are no more to call Good, Evil,
or Evil, Good, than we are to Judge one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I am gone over my own Character;
and shall only demand this from you of Right,
That, so far as Truth and Honesty is on my side,
it may not, nor ought not to be despis'd for
being usher'd in by an unworthy Instrument.</P>
<P>And 'tis strange, Sir, that you who Animadvert
upon me for Judging, should so severely judge
me, and that wrongfully too, as shall appear in
the Particulars of this short Discourse.</P>
<P>I cou'd not be satisfi'd to say less to this Point
on these Accounts, because I must put in a <HI>Caveat</HI>
against Personal Reflections as unfair in the Dis∣pute:
He that pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s first to Confute the Argu∣ment,
is welcome to show his Wit in Satyrizing
upon the Follies and Afflictions of the Author:
And there I leave it, and proceed to what I con∣ceive
is your Third Mistake about me.</P>
<P><HI>Viz.</HI> My Profession. And this you seem to
make plain, while from the 13th, to the 24th Page,
you treat me as an Independent, and spend your
Time to Reply to the particular Tenents in dispute
between You and Them; which, with Submission,
I conceive to be nothing at all to the purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8" MS="y"/>
After this, <HI>P.</HI> 30, 31, 32, I am talk'd with as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI>
and a <HI>Leveller;</HI> what of these Prin∣ciples
any-where appears in the Enquiry, I con∣fess
I am at a loss to know; nor, Sir, have you been
so kind to lay it down.</P>
<P>Indeed I own my self somewhat surpriz'd to
see you run on in Answering the scrupulous Inde∣pendent
about <HI>Kneeling at the Sacrament,</HI> and the
Extravagant <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> about seizing the
Properties of Mankind for the Use of the Saints;
and such things as these, by way of Reply to an
<HI>Enquiry about Occasional promiscuous Conformity:</HI> and am
still at a Loss to find an Antecedent to this Relative.</P>
<P>I assure you I am no <HI>Independent,</HI> nor <HI>Fifth-Monar∣chy-man,</HI>
nor <HI>Leveller.</HI> You have shown your Learn∣ing,
Sir, and Confuted an Error inconsistent with
Civil Society: Very well; but this had been bet∣ter
done by it self; it had no more relation to the
Case in hand, than a Lecture against the <HI>Alchoran;</HI>
and you might as well conjecture me to be a <HI>Ma∣hometan,</HI>
as a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man,</HI> from any thing in
the Book that looks like either. But, Sir, since
I am led by you to give an account of my Pro∣fession,
which, I hope, I shall always be ready
to do; I shall do it in few words: That I am
of the same Class, and in the same Denomination
of a Dissenter with your self, your Office excepted,
and am willing to be guided by, and to practise
the Great Rule of Christian Charity in all the pro∣per
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="y"/>
and legal Extents of it: Indeed I have more
need to practise it than you, because I stand more
in need of it from others, with respect to the Cau∣ses
already nam'd. And however, by wresting
Words, and mistaking my Intentions, you are plea∣sed
to see nothing of it; I am not yet convinc'd
that I have broken that Great Christian Rule of
Charity, in any thing I have written.</P>
<P>I come now to the Fourth Thing in which you
are mistaken, which is in my <HI>Intentions;</HI> in which
you rashly, and, I assure you, wrongfully judge me,
however cautious you wou'd have me be of judging
others: But, Sir, <HI>Humanum eft Errare;</HI> you are no
more Infallible, I see, than I, and are fallen into
the same rash Error you Reprove me for with so
much Severity; by judging, that the principal De∣sign
of this Book was to reflect upon a Worthy
Gentleman, who is nam'd in the Preface: And in
one place you are pleas'd to join me with the
Party who Oppos'd him, and bring me in making
my Court to them.</P>
<P>All these, Sir, I shall make appear to be not
only Mistakes, but groundless Mistakes; such as
nothing but the same Thoughts which put you out
of Temper, cou'd lead you into: And I can so∣lemnly
Appeal in the Form you have set down,
that you have wrong'd me in your Censure.</P>
<P>First, Sir, the <HI>Enquiry</HI> was publish'd Three years
ago, and therefore cou'd not be design'd as a Per∣sonal
<PB N="9" REF="10" MS="y"/>
Invective against the Gentleman you speak
of: All that can be said, is, That the Cause be∣ing
again given, the Re-printing it was design'd
as a Reproof to the Practice: and so much I own.
As for <HI>Persons,</HI> I am indifferent; <HI>if the Coat fits any
body, let them wear it.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Sir, I declare my self, if of any Party,
I am, and ever was for the <HI>English</HI> Liberty, and
for the putting such Men into the Magistracy, who,
in Concurrence with the King, our Supreme Magi∣strate,
wou'd protect and preserve that Liberty.
And, as a Person every way qualified to execute a
Trust of so much Honour, whether profitable or
not, I won't examine, I gave my Vote for Sir <HI>Thomas
Abney,</HI> and shou'd ha' done so, if I had the Power
of Ten Thousand Voices; and no Man has more
Respect for, or Opinion of his Honesty and Ability
than my self: Nor have I, God be thank'd, any
Occasion to say this to flatter him; <HI>for I neither
want his Favour, nor fear his Anger.</HI></P>
<P>Herein therefore I presume to say you have been
entirely mistaken; and these Errors have led you
to waste your Time, and the Reader's too, in ma∣king
needless Remarks, and Answering those peo∣ple
who never Oppos'd you.</P>
<P>I come now to that part of your Book which re∣spects
the Case in hand; which, as it is the least
part, and indeed seems to agree with the Title,
that it is only a <HI>Consideration</HI> of the Preface; <HI>for really,
<PB N="10" REF="11" MS="y"/>
with submission, there is very little Answer to the Fact:</HI>
So it requires not that I shou'd Reply to the Argu∣ment;
for I see none, but that drawing back the
Curtain which you have spread over the Subject, I
shou'd set it in a True Light, that all Men may
judge by their own Consciences, and the Scripture-Rule,
and take care they be not distinguish'd out
of their Reason and Religion by the Cunning and
Artifice of Words.</P>
<P>Please therefore, Sir, to admit me to run over
your Book with as modest Animadversions as my
just Defence will allow; and I am content to stand
Corrected, where I fail in point of Decency.</P>
<P>First, You quarrel with me for a “<HI>Breach of Kind∣ness
and Equity, in biding my own Name, and Reveal∣ing
yours. Designing my self to fight in the Dark, and
expecting you to do it in open Light.</HI>” And you give
us Five whole Pages, including the Quotation of
your self in your Preface to the Inhabitants of <HI>Tor∣rington,</HI>
to show your Indifferency in Controverted
Disputes, and consequently your Unwillingness to
engage in this.</P>
<P>Truly, Sir, as to the First, I thought a publick
Appeal to you, who are a publick Person, had
been no Sin against Kindness or Equity; if it be,
I ask your Pardon.</P>
<P>As to my Concealing my Name, I have given
you my Reasons already; and as to my Exposing
yours, had you thought fit to have Replied to the
<PB N="11" REF="12" MS="y"/>
Book which lay Three years unanswer'd, without
being address'd to any person in particular, you had
been at Liberty to have remain'd as unexpos'd as
the Author.</P>
<P>But the Enquiry being unanswer'd, gave some
people more prejudice against the Integrity of Dis∣senters
in general, than I cou'd wish to have found;
upon which I thought it necessary to have the Mat∣ter
discuss'd, if possible; and knew no Man more
concern'd to do it, <HI>nor more capable than your
self.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is your Answering me such a Disappoint∣ment
as you are pleas'd to mention; but that you
shou'd attempt it, and do it to no more purpose,
is, I confess, more Disappointment to me than
any thing I cou'd ha' met with.</P>
<P>Whether, Sir, the Indifferency you are so pleas'd
with in your Temper, be Congruous to your Pro∣fession
as a <HI>Gospel Minister,</HI> I shall not examine:
Whether you that are Pastor of a Dissenting-Church,
and Administer the Ordinances of Christ
to a Select People, in a way Dissenting from the
Establish'd Church, and thereby maintain a Schism
in the said Establish'd Church, ought to be so indiffe∣rent
as to boast that you never persuaded any Man
to Conform, or not to Conform, I leave it to your
self to consider; I am sure, if I was arriv'd to that
Coldness in the matter my self, I wou'd Conform
immediately; for I think what I affirm'd in the
<PB N="12" REF="13" MS="y"/>
<HI>Enquiry,</HI> Page <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. remains a Truth unanswer'd by
you: “<HI>That Schism from a True Establish'd Church
of Christ, is a great Sin; and if I can Conform, I ought
to Conform.</HI>”</P>
<P>From this Declaration of your own Indifferency
to meddle in Matters of Controversy, with your
Reasons for it, which I suppose you wou'd have ta∣ken
as Introductory to what follows, you are pleas'd
to proceed <HI>very angrily</HI> to examine why I engage you
in this quarrel: I have given you an account of it
already with all the honesty and plainness I can;
and I thought a person in your Place wou'd never
have Resented the being put upon the Defence of
his Profession, or being civilly ask'd a Question
about it; and I cannot but observe how carefully
you avoid, being engag'd in the present Dispute.</P>
<P><HI>I ought to have been well assur'd, you say,</HI>
(1.) That you did advise one way or the other; <HI>Or,</HI>
(2.) That you ought to have done so.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, I think it immaterial whether you
<HI>were,</HI> or no; or, whether you <HI>ought,</HI> or no;
for I never Charg'd you with the first, or affirm'd
the last; but only ask'd this fair Question:</P>
<P>Whether it was allow'd by Dissenters in general,
or by your Congregation in particular? To which
Question you give no Answer.</P>
<P>But I shall answer you honestly and directly:
I am assur'd, as far as Rationally I can be, by Con∣sequences
of things, <HI>that you have not advised one
<PB N="13" REF="14" MS="y"/>
way or other:</HI> Nor do I affirm you ought to have
done so, unless the person concern'd, applied to
you for Advice in point of Conscience on the Case;
if he did, I do not see how you could decline it.
so that to me, it seems, you either were oblig'd,
or not oblig'd, as the Application of the person
concern'd might alter the Case; I do not say you
were oblig'd officiously to tender your Advice in
the Case: <HI>If I am wrong here, I shall acknowledge my
Error when I am better inform'd.</HI></P>
<P>The next thing will come close to the Point;
Whether it be a <HI>Fault,</HI> an <HI>unlawful Action,</HI> or no,
for a Dissenter, <HI>as such,</HI> to hold Occasional Com∣munion
with the Establish'd Church, and, at the
same time, continue in, or return to his Relative
Conjunction with a Separate Church?</P>
<P>That it is not a sinsul Act simply to have Com∣munion
with the Establish'd Church, I willingly
agree. But since on this Point depends the Weight
of our present Dispute, I must conclude, That I
think 'tis a sinsul Act Circumstantially and Con∣junctively.</P>
<P>And because I wou'd be rightly understood, I
shall endeavour to be Explicit, though I run the
hazard of being counted impertinent.</P>
<P>I have laid down the Case, I thought, fairly,
and of which you are pleas'd to take no notice, in
the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> Page 12.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15" MS="y"/>
“He who Dissents from an Establish'd Church from
any other Reasons but such as these; That he re∣ally
believes the said Establish'd Church is not of the
purest Institution, but that be can serve God in a Form
more agreeable to his Will; and that accordingly 'tis
his Duty to do it so, and no otherwise: Such a one
ought to Conform, because to make a Wilful Schism in
the Church, is doubtless a great Sin; and if I can
avoid it, I ought to avoid it.”</P>
<P>If then I am guided by this real Principle of
Conscience to Dissent, how can I Conform with∣out
Sinning against that Conscience, by which only
my Dissenting is made Lawful?</P>
<P>And thus, Sir, I am brought to my Argument
again: Of which I shall give you this short Ab∣stract;
and you, or any body else, are welcome
to be angry with me, if you will be pleas'd first
to Answer it:</P>
<P>That he who Dissents from the Establish'd Church, ex∣cept
from a true Principle of Conscience, is guilty of a great
Sin.</P>
<P>That he who Conforms to the Establish'd Church against
his Conscience, is guilty of a great Sin.</P>
<P>That he who both Dissents and Conforms at the same time
and in the same Point of Religion, must be guilty of one
of these great Sins.</P>
<P>That he who has committed either of these Sins, ought
not to be receiv'd again on either side on any other Terms
than as a Penitent.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="16" MS="y"/>
I do not examine, as I hinted then, whether
the Gentleman you would embroil me with, be
thus guilty; <HI>be that to himself.</HI></P>
<P>But I must now come to your Distinctions:
Indeed, Sir, I believe as you say, that taking which
side you will, you may puzzle the most of plain
people, who are but of ordinary Understandings in
the Controversy about Ceremonies: And give me
leave to add, That such is the Subtilty and Nicety
of Sophistical Reasonings, that Men may almost
Distinguish themselves into, and out of any Opini∣on;
and some People, who are Masters of the Art
of Nice Arguing, too often lose both Themselves
and their Religion in the Labyrinths of Words:
<HI>School Divinity and Practical Christianity are Two things,</HI>
and seldom understood by the same Heads.</P>
<P>But, Sir, with the greatest Respect, and some
Concern, let me tell you, I did not think to find
all the Difference between the Dissenters and the
Church of <HI>England</HI> d windl'd into <HI>Three additional Ap∣pendices,
in which we have some Difference, and so:</HI> and
this from Mr. <HI>How,</HI> who is Pastor of a Separate
Church.</P>
<P>If we differ from them in Trifles, or have but
a Trifling Difference, I think we can never justify
making so large a Chasm in the Church; we have
much to answer for, without question, in the too
fatal Divisions of this Nation, if it has all been
occasion'd by a few small Appendices.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="17" MS="y"/>
If our Differences are not Matters of Conscience,
I have no more to say; if they are, 'tis a Myste∣ry
yet hidden from the Common Understand∣ings,
how they can be first insisted on from a
Principle of Conscience, and then wav'd with∣out
acting against that Conscience, which only
could justify the first insisting on them: If you
can Distinguish us into this, I am mistaken.</P>
<P>I allow your Distinctions of Sins, which are
Consistent or Inconsistent with the Christian State
to be Orthodox and Right.</P>
<P>I allow your Distinctions of Negative and Af∣firmative
Precepts, and, according to my weak
Talent, agree with you in them.</P>
<P>But the Consequence you draw, with submissi∣on,
does not reach the Case; which is, That scru∣pulous
Persons ought to be fully persuaded in their
own Minds; and Fellow-Christians were not to
Judge, but to Receive them.</P>
<P>This you have answer'd your self, <HI>P.</HI> 13. to be
meant in dubious and small Matters: And if we
must stick here, we are next to Examine, Whether
the Difference between Us and the Establish'd
Church be only in dubious and small Matters; if
it be, I know not how we shall Ward off the Blow
of being guilty of Schism; the Sin of which I sup∣pose
you will not dispute. Wherefore to descend
to some Particulars—- If I know why we Dissent
<PB N="17" REF="18" MS="y"/>
from the Establish'd Church, 'tis principally on such
accounts as these.</P>
<P>1. On account of the Episcopal
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Clarkson</HI>'s No-Scripture-Evidence for Diocesan Bishops.</NOTE> Hierarchy, Prelatical Ordination
and Super-intendency.</P>
<P>2. On account of their imposing things own'd
to be indifferent, as Terms of Communion.</P>
<P>3. On account of their imposing things own'd
to be otherwise indifferent, as made necessary by
the Command of the Civil Magistrate.</P>
<P>As to Partial Conformity, Dissenting in some
things, and Conforming in others, which you men∣tion
<HI>Page.</HI> it does not seem to concern this Case.
No Man among the Dissenters, I believe, pretend∣ed
to Dissent in every thing; but we are speaking
of Conforming in those very Points in which we
Dissent, and that no less than the <HI>Article of Com∣munion.</HI></P>
<P>If these are your small things, I am content to
stand by it, and ready to prove, as I said in the
<HI>Enquiry:</HI></P>
<P>That whoever Separates from this Church, and
at the same time Conforms to it; by Conforming,
denies his Dissent being Lawful; or, by his Dissent∣ing,
Damns his Conforming as Sinful.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="19" MS="y"/>
All this, Sir, you have not thought fit to touch
upon, for Reasons which you know best; and I
really wonder you shou'd take so much pains to
Cavil at me and a simple Preface, which really
was not worth your while; and when you have
led your self into the Argument, take no notice of
the thing it self, as it is Objected, but Distinguish
so nicely about the smaller matters, and omit the
greater.</P>
<P>If we differ from the Establish'd Church in small
things only, we are to blame to make the Breach so
wide: Was it for small and dubious Things only
that we suffer'd Process of the Law, Excommuni∣cations,
Seizures of our Estates, and Imprisonment
of our Persons? And since you are pleas'd to bring
in that Honourable Gentleman, speaking in the
first Person to the Point, as an Inference drawn from
your Distinctions, and your self telling us what
be may perhaps do;</P>
<P>Give me leave to go through those Supposititi∣ous
Cases with you, Sir. <HI>As to the particular Person,
you concern him in it, not I.</HI></P>
<P>1. <HI>You say,</HI> “He may have Arguments so specious, that
supposing he Err, may Impose upon the Judgment, and
thereby Direct the Practice of a very Intelligent, Dis∣cerning,
and Upright-hearted Man, so as to make him
think that which is perhaps an Error, his present Duty,
and so not offer Violence to his Conscience.”</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="20" MS="y"/>
I Answer: Admit he does so; yet while you at
the same time allow <HI>he Errs,</HI> that is, Sins; why
ought not he to be admonished to Repent of that
Sin, before he be receiv'd again into Communion?
This is what I mean by being receiv'd as a Peni∣tent:
You grant (<HI>P.</HI> 9.) a Man is to do the part
of a Penitent for a Fault; and this Error is a Fault,
though it were an Error of Ignorance.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Then you say, P.</HI> 18. “As judging such a Church
true as to Essentials, he may think (Occasion inviting)
he hath greater Reason, though it be Defective in Acci∣dents,
to Communicate with it sometimes, than to shun
its Communion always.”</P>
<P>Pardon me, Sir, I must say this seems a Sophism
in Religion; for allow he may think so, you must
allow he ought not to think so. And why <HI>Occasion
inviting?</HI> why not <HI>Occasion compelling?</HI> 'Tis mani∣fest,
Force cou'd not <HI>compel,</HI> why shou'd Occasion
<HI>invite?</HI></P>
<P>I confine not my Argument to this Gentleman;
but of Others I can prove, That Force cou'd not
<HI>compel</HI> them, but Occasion, that is, Honour and
Preferment cou'd <HI>invite</HI> them. Now if you please
to Reconcile this for me, I shall be gotten over one
Point; Whether a Man can justify suffering to the
Ruin, perhaps of his Family, rather than com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
with that which he may do without imposing upon
his Conscience, and which, Occasion inviting, he
may judge lawful?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="21" MS="y"/>
You have another Distinction which, I confess,
I hardly think to be Rational, that is, Unprofitable
Preferment, <HI>Page <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> First, I neither understand
that the Instance you are upon is Unprofitable, nor
believe it; nor that the Epethite can be proper to
the word; for that which is Unprofitable, cannot
be a Preferment.</P>
<P>I must also observe here, Sir, that the Conformi∣ty
exacted in the late Reigns, was not so large as
what these Gentlemen are pleas'd to comply with
voluntarily. Now as to the Ceremonies you in∣sist
on, and which indeed I do not, as the way of
Administration, Kneeling, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it was allow'd to
be so indifferent then, that many receiv'd in the
Church Standing. But when these <HI>Unprofitable Pre∣ferments,</HI>
as you please to call them, invite, they
seek of themselves what before they cou'd not be
forc'd to.</P>
<P>3. <HI>You ask us another Question:</HI> “What if some
have thought that alone a sufficient Reason for their
Occasional Communion with a Church, with whom they
have not constant Communion, That they may testify to
the World they Decline it not as no Church, but so far
practically own it as the Reason of the thing requires;
may they not be supposed to do this, as thinking it a
good Reason, whether it be so or no, without going against
Conscience herein?”</P>
<P>Truly, Sir, I must suppose these <HI>It may be's,</HI> and
<HI>Why may not's,</HI> are put in to make out what you said
<PB N="21" REF="22" MS="y"/>
<HI>Page <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> that you cou'd puzzle a mean Understand∣ing
both ways; and, I thank God, you are driven
to the Necessity of these Arts. But to let you see
these Suppositions may be replied to;</P>
<P>1. Sir, the Church of <HI>England</HI> however, must
own Her self very much oblig'd to such Gentlemen
who will Conform only to Vindicate her Reputa∣tion.</P>
<P>2. They may be supposed to do thus, but they
cannot be supposed to do so without a manifest
gross Ignorance, and taking that for a good Reason
which is none at all: For if, Sir, you will admit
that a Man is in the Right as to himself, while he
thinks he is so, then you open the way to the fatal
Latitude of all manner of Error; for no Man is
guilty of an Error, as an Error, but as his Judg∣ment
may be perverted to believe himself right,
when he is wrong.</P>
<P>Page 19. <HI>you are pleas'd to Object for me:</HI>
“Since, Sir, you think it not unlawful to Communicate
with such a Church sometimes, why shou'd you not (for
Common Order-sake) do it always?”</P>
<P>Sir, if you please to give me leave to ask Que∣stions
for my self, I wou'd state it something more
fairly to the Case in hand, thus: <HI>Since, Sir, you
think it not Unlawful to Communicate with such
a Church sometimes, why shou'd you not, to avoid
the just Imputation of Schism, which is a great
Sin, have done it always?</HI> And why never do
<PB N="22" REF="23" MS="y"/>
it, but when upon an Occasion of Preferment
inviting, you find it necessary to protect you from
the Penalty of the Law?</P>
<P>I shou'd ha' been very glad you had stated this
Question fully, and suppose what Answer you
please; for, <HI>upon my word, I can suppose none,</HI>
unless I wou'd bring him in, owning the Crime,
and repenting of it; which I shou'd be glad to,
hear of.</P>
<P>What you say, I shall stare at, Page 20. “<HI>I wil∣lingly
admit, that what is simply best, may not be best for
Practice in present Circumstances.</HI>” And I must like∣wise
re-mind you, Sir, That what may be simply
Lawful, may be unlawful Circumstantially: And
so I affirm this to be, and dare undertake to prove
it so, without coming into the Number of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s
Fools, with whom you have rank'd me for <HI>propo∣sing
hastily beyond Seven Men that can render a Reason.</HI></P>
<P>Here, Sir, <HI>viz.</HI> at your 20th Page; I must leave
you to Combat with the <HI>Independents;</HI> and let them
answer for themselves; I am not at all concern'd
in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>And you spend three or four Pages as an Advo∣cate
for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> concerning Modes
and Gestures; in which, I am sure, I am far from
placing the least Weight, where serious Christianity
is to be found; and God forbid either you or I, Sir,
shou'd be found making a Rent in the Christian
Union of this Church and Nation, if their Kneel∣ing
<PB N="23" REF="24" MS="y"/>
at the Sacrament, or the Use of a Liturgy, were
all the Dispute; 'tis you have led me into saying
any thing of the Difference between the National
Church and the Dissenters.</P>
<P>I know that the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the Primitive Church
included the Forms of their Administrations and
Publick Services; and need not recite my Autho∣rities
for it to you, who know it better than I;
nor that they are found in the Time of <HI>Tertullian,</HI>
and long before him. But I know also, and the
contrary has never been prov'd, that those Forms
were not impos'd as Terms of Communion, and
under the Penalty of Laws, at least till the Divi∣sion
of the Church between the <HI>Arians</HI> and the
Orthodox, when Error and Persecution got into
the Church, and the Evil Spirit reign'd, to the De∣struction
of both sides.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I find you no more talking to
me till you come to <HI>Page</HI> 25. where you are plea∣sed
to Satyrize upon my Title and Preface.</P>
<P>Really, Sir, I believe my self capable to Defend
my Book against all that the Power of Cavil and
Sophistry can suggest; and therefore I am not so∣licitous
for my Preface and Title-page.</P>
<P>But that I may satisfy your Request; and tel∣ling
you first, that-you oblige me to it: I shall
be plain.</P>
<P>“You desire me to examine my own heart, what I
meant by that suggestion? In Cases of Preferment,
<PB N="24" REF="25" MS="y"/>
mentioned in the Title; was it not to Insinuate, that Pre∣ferment
was the Inducement to that Worthy Person to
act agaist his Conscience?”</P>
<P>Sir, Will you be pleased to <HI>Examiné your own Rea∣son,</HI>
how that can be, when the Words were print∣ed
Three years before the Fact; and I appeal to
God and the World, whether you have not wrong∣fully
Judg'd me then. But to make it more plain:</P>
<P>I do not say he, or any body else, does it for Pre∣ferment;
<HI>you are pleas'd strangely to mistake me:</HI> I say,
they may have the Preferment without it.</P>
<P>'Tis done to save their Money, to save the Five
hundred Pounds, which is the Penalty of the Act:
I am sorry you have not read the Book before you
ventur'd to make so severe a Remark. For your bet∣ter
Information therefore, Sir, I refer you to <HI>P.</HI> 19.
in the <HI>Enquiry,</HI> where my Words are plain.</P>
<P>As to the Worthy Gentleman, <HI>whose Cause you would
have this to be;</HI> you say this has been his known
Judgment and Practice several years.</P>
<P>Tho' it were true, yet, Sir, this is no Argument
to prove the thing lawful or to prove that it is not
practised, even in every part that I have laid down,
by others before him, and like to be so after him;
it only quits him of doing it against his Conscience,
to qualify himself for the unprofitable Preferment
you mention: <HI>and this I never Charg'd him with.</HI></P>
<P>That he has done the Fact, no body Disputes;
but that he did it against his Conscience, I never
<PB N="25" REF="26" MS="y"/>
alledg'd; <HI>you put that upon me, Sir, unjustly:</HI> Be
his Conscience to God and himself, I know better
than to judge him, nor can you without a Breach
of Charity suggest it of me.</P>
<P>Nor do I any-where say that others have
acted against their Consciences that do so; possi∣bly
they may, by the help of <HI>nice Distinguishing,</HI>
Reason themselves into a Belief of their being in
the Right.</P>
<P>But the Point in Debate is, Whether, <HI>whatever
their Opinions may be in the Case,</HI> the Act it self
be not, as I have said, Circumstantially sinful:
For I hope you will grant me they are never the
more in the Right for its being their Opinion;
Truth is always unmov'd, sullen, and the same,
whatever Gloss our Fancy or Interest puts upon it.</P>
<P>But since you will have it be this Gentleman's
practice, which I think no Reputation to him, nor
Defence of the Practice: Nor do I think you or
he can justify your Dissenting from the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> and that Practice together: Since, I
say, you will have it be that Gentleman's practice;
all you gain by that in point of Argument, is, That
he did not do it against his Conscience, nor to
serve the present Turn. And what then? I affirm
to you, I neither meant him, nor any Man else,
but him that is Guilty; and I meant him, and eve∣ry
body else, if they are guilty. And what is all
this to the purpose? The Question is not here,
<PB N="26" REF="27" MS="y"/>
Who is, or is not guilty of it; but whether the
thing in its own Nature, aggravated with the Cir∣cumstances
of Turn and Return, timed for Pre∣ferment,
with all the black <HI>Et cetera's</HI> of it, as 'tis
lately practic'd, and as I have laid it down, be a
Crime, or no?</P>
<P>If this Gentleman you <HI>would Embroil me with,</HI> did
formerly live in a general, or ordinary Communion,
both with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and a private Con∣gregation,
before either the Preferments I mention
invited, or the Penalty of the Law forced him to
it; Then he stands clear of this part of the Charge,
That he did it for the Protection of his Interest;
but still the Matter of Fact is true.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, I have said what I thought my self
oblig'd to by way of Reply to your Considerations:
And as to your severe Censures, tho' I have a great
Opinion of your Charity, however you seem to
be out of Temper in this Case; yet I appeal from
your Judgment, to the Judgment of Truth; and
waving all your puzzling Distinctions, which my
Respect for your Person and Character, will not
permit me to Descant upon; give me leave to
make this short Conclusion.</P>
<P>Sincerity is the Glory of a Christian; the Native
Lustre of an honest Heart is impossible to be hid;
'twill shine through all his Life in one Action or
another, in spite of Scandal; and it wants no Arti∣fice
to set it out.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="28" MS="y"/>
If the Practice we Discourse of be to be Defend∣ed,
<HI>let it be a Practice;</HI> I mean, let it be Volun∣tary,
let it be Free and Spontaneous; and if Gentle∣men,
who have such a Latitude in their Opinions,
wou'd not have it thought they are mov'd to it by
their Interests, let them practice it openly, and not
Time it so to the very <HI>Eve</HI> of an Election, as to
have it speak of it self, and, as it were, force Men
to believe it done on purpose; nay, let them not
put such a Reproach in the Mouths of their Ene∣mies,
as to have it spoken in Contempt, with Cir∣cumstances
that stop the Mouths of Argument, and
are as Convincing as Demonstration.</P>
<P>You have given your Blessing to them at the Con∣clusion
of your Book, with a <HI>Let them go on and
prosper.</HI> I wish you have not spoken Peace where
there is no Peace: As to its being a <HI>Secret between
God and Them;</HI> I shall only say, <HI>Enter not into
their Secret, O my Soul!</HI> 'Tis an <HI>Arcana</HI> that is hid∣den
from my Eyes; and I doubt very much how
it can consist with Consulting the Rule with the
serious Diligence you recommend: For certainly
were the great Christian Rule consulted, it wou'd
instruct them, that the Profess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of the Christian
Religion is not a thing, the Forms whereof are
of such Indifference, as you seem to make it; that
'tis not a light thing to shift and change Commu∣nion
with an Establish'd, and with a Separate
Church, as often as Convenience, or Reason of
State, or Interest, invite.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29" MS="y"/>
And whether I set my Name to this, or no?
Whether I am an <HI>Independent? I hope they are Christi∣ans
too as well as other folks.</HI> Whether I am a <HI>Fifth-Monarchy-man?</HI>
Whether the Book was design'd
against my Lord Mayor, <HI>tho' 'twas wrote Three years
before he was Chosen?</HI> Or, whether any thing else you
Censoriously Charge me with be true, or no, seems
to me not worth your while to Examine? Since if
I shou'd grant them all, the Argument of Occasio∣nal
Conformity remains untouch'd.</P>
<P>If the Truth be made the worse for my Temper,
I am sorry for it: But this is another of Mr. <HI>How</HI>'s
Paradoxes, <HI>and something like your Unprofitable
Preferment,</HI> that Truth, tho' it be mix'd with the
worst Temper in the World, shou'd thereby be so
debased, as to become worse than Error.</P>
<P>Sir, I had ended here, but for a Clause you force
me to Reply to, concerning the Old <HI>Puritans,</HI> who
you tax me with abusing: Indeed 'twas as remote
from my Thoughts, as 'twas, that ever it was possi∣ble
you cou'd treat an Adversary with such Lan∣guage.</P>
<P>And, but that I shall not suffer my self to be
transported beyond the Bounds of Civility, and so
fall into your Error, I could allow my self to be
very much mov'd, That such a Man as you should
venture to Charge me with what is neither true in
Fact, nor can be suggested by Consequence from
any thing I have wrote: And, Sir, you must give
<PB N="29" REF="30" MS="y"/>
me leave to say, I am sorry you shou'd lay your self
so open, and force me to so severe a Remark.</P>
<P>You are pleas'd to affirm, That I industriously
represent the Primitive <HI>English</HI> Puritans, as if they
were generally of my <HI>stingy, narrow</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P>And here you run upon me with ill Language,
<HI>How I could think to Impose upon the World in a matter of
so recent Memory;</HI> and, <HI>How I could have the Confi∣dence,</HI>
&amp;c. This is really a new sort of Stile from
Mr. <HI>How.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, I have industriously examin'd the Book I wrote;
and, as I am sure I never entertain'd a Thought
in prejudice of the beft Character which can be gi∣ven
those Primitive Reformers; so I cannot find one
word in the whole Book which can, no, not with
the help of an <HI>Inuendo,</HI> be so much as pretended
to look that way.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Sir, unless you can make it out, or,
by the help of some of your Distinctions, come off
from it; I hope you will do me so much Justice, as
you are a Man of Truth and Honesty, to recant the
Scandal, and acknowledge your self mistaken.</P>
<P>And that I may leave it to every body to judge,
whether I have not just Ground for what I say; I
shall qaote here all that I have said relating to the
<HI>Puritans,</HI> and impartially lay down the Matter of
Fact.</P>
<P>After I had given a short Abridgment of our
Reformation, and Recited the Controversy be∣tween
<PB N="30" REF="31" MS="y"/>
Bishop <HI>Ridley</HI> and Bishop <HI>Hooper,</HI> I pro∣ceeded
thus, Page the 6th. “<HI>When Queen</HI> Eliza∣beth
<HI>Restored the Protestant Religion, and the Church
enjoy'd its Peace again, the Debate reviv'd: But the
first Establishment of King</HI> Edward, <HI>obtain'd so on
the Minds of Men, that the farther Reformation was
rejected: The other Party being not at all Convinc'd,
tho' Over rul'd, submitted their Persons to the Laws,
but not their Opinions; affirming, That it was the Duty
of every Christian to endeavour to serve God with the
greatest Purity of Worship as was possible; and that
this was the purest Worship which came nearest the Di∣vine
Institution, which they believed the Establish'd
Liturgy did not; and therefore in Conscience they
must be Dissenters.”</HI></P>
<P>Having made this Quotation, which I have
sufficient Authotity to prove genuine, from a Ma∣nuscript
of a famous Man in those days, which
I have seen, and on occasion am ready to pro∣duce;
I go on thus:</P>
<P>“<HI>It must be own'd, that the Original Authors of these
Disputes were Learned, Devout, and Singularly Pious,
strict in Conversation to Excess,</HI> if that were possi∣ble;
<HI>and from thence, in a sort of happy Derision, were
call'd</HI> Puritans: <HI>Of whom I shall say nothing, but leave
for a Record the last Speech of a famous Foreigner;</HI>”</P>
<P>Sit anima mea, cum Puritannis Anglicanis.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32" MS="y"/>
This is all the Words that have the least Retro∣spect
on the <HI>Puritans;</HI> unless you will pretend
that a few words, <HI>Page</HI> 24. is meant of them,
which no Man can have any Colour of Reason
for: But lest that shou'd be pretended, I shall quote
them also, <HI>Page</HI> 24.</P>
<P>“The Dissenters can never pretend to be Dissenters
upon the meer Principle of Purity of Worship, as I have
related in the beginning of this Discourse; if such shall
be receiv'd as blameless into their Communion, who have
Deserted them upon occasion of Preferment.”</P>
<P>This refers back to <HI>Page</HI> 12. where, I say, I shall
give my Essay as to what I understand a real Dis∣senting
Protestant is; not can it refer to any other
place: But <HI>if you shou'd still say</HI> it looks back to the
<HI>Puritans,</HI> 'twou'd puzzle a better Head than mine
to find out a Reflection on them in it.</P>
<P>But this is not the only thing in which you are
pleas'd to injure both me and the Truth: For,
<HI>Page</HI> 28. you tell me with some Heat too, “<HI>That
throughout my Book, such as are not so stingily</HI> (your
Favourite-word, Sir) <HI>bigotted to a Party,</HI> as I,
are treated with this sort of Charity, to be stil'd
<HI>Painted Hypocrites, such as play Bo-peep with God Al∣mighty;
That if such an Occasion offer it self to any
of them to serve God and their Country in a publick
Station; do what the Law requires, and which they
think they may sinlesly do in order to it; do trespass
upon their Consciences, and Damn their Souls to save
their Countries.</HI>”</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="33" MS="y"/>
Sir, <HI>for God-sake,</HI> how came you to let your Pas∣sion
thus out-run your Memory?</P>
<P>There is not one word of all this true; <HI>pardon
me that I am oblig'd in my own Defence to say so;</HI>
I refer you to the Original to convince your
self of it, and I'll take the pains to go along with
you in the Examination.</P>
<P>First, As to <HI>painted Hypocrites,</HI> 'tis spoken of the
whole Body of Protestants in <HI>England, in haec Verba.</HI></P>
<P>P. 8. “<HI>I must acknowledge it fares with the Church of</HI>
England, <HI>and with Dissenters both, as it has always
far'd with Christ's Church in the whole World; that
while suppress'd and persecuted, their Professors were
few, and their Profession more severe: But when Re∣ligion
comes to be the Mode of a Country,</HI> so many
painted Hypocrites, there's the word, <HI>get into
the Church, that Guile is not to be seen till it arrive to
Apostacy.</HI>”</P>
<P>Pray, Sir, who can these <HI>painted Hypocrites</HI> refer
to, that you should say, <HI>Inuendo, All those that are
not of my Party, or that are not so stingy as I?</HI></P>
<P>These painted Hypocrites must belong to that
Religion which is the Mode of the Country; which
must rather mean the Church of <HI>England</HI> than the
Dissenters; and yet if I meant either of them, it
cannot be made a Reflection, because 'tis confin'd
only to such as are Apostates from Religion, not such
as continue to Conform to both or either of them.</P>
<P>This is Judging me indeed neither with Charity
nor Truth: The next Words are, <HI>Such as play Bo∣peep
<PB N="33" REF="34" MS="y"/>
with God Almighty.</HI> Pray, good Sir, reflect on
<HI>Solomon,</HI> and what is said of such as judge of a Mat∣ter
before they hear it: I am persuaded you did not
read the Clause; which is thus:</P>
<P>I had been Examining the woful Excuse of some
people, and <HI>too many such we had,</HI> who wou'd take
the Sacrament at the Church, and pretend 'twas done
only as a Civil Action; on which I made such Re∣marks
as, I think, so prophane a Practice deserv'd;
and at last added, <HI>This is playing Bo-peep with God Al∣mighty.</HI></P>
<P>And, pray Sir, if I may be so free with you, do
but examine the Circumstance as I have laid it
down, and tell me from the Sincerity of your Soul,
<HI>if you are not of the same mind.</HI></P>
<P>The other Reflection is on such, who, tho' it be
against their Consciences, pretend 'tis to serve their
Country: Of these, I say, “<HI>They are Patriots indeed,
who will Damn their Souls to save their Country:</HI>”
Not that thereby I imply, that to take the Sacra∣ment
with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> wou'd Damn any
man's Soul, if he Communicated with a right Prin∣ciple;
but to do it to serve a Turn, which is the
Question in hand, I won't answer for, tho 'it were
Inverted from the Church to a Dissenting Congre∣gation.</P>
<P>All these Instances, Sir, and more which I could
reckon up, serve to make me admire wherein I have
so provok'd you, as to remove you from your wont∣ed
Candor: And since my Writing on a Cause,
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
which I expected fairer Quarter in, so Exceedingly
moves you, I shall chuse rather to lay down the
Controversy, than to Engage with a person, who,
I shou'd be very much concern'd to see exceed the
Rules which he has with so much Success, and with
so much Applause prescrib'd to others.</P>
<P>I always thought Men might Dispute without
Railing, and Differ without Quarrelling; and that
Opinions need not affect our Tempers: But since it
is not to be found, I leave it to those who have a
better Talent that way than I.</P>
